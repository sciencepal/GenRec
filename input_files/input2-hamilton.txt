I mean, i WAS pretty high, but still.<br/><br/>It definitely lived up to my hype. Although many musical adaptations have flopped this may have proved that best way to do it is simply film the play. What you get is one of the best musicals available to watch whenever you like at an affordable price. Great work by everyone involved especially Lin Manuel Miranda. I've been lucky enough to catch the show on tour in Minneapolis and it was amazing. As another reviewer said, this is how all Broadway productions should be released - not all Hollywood stylized - but a live filmed production of the original cast before an audience. About as close to perfection as you can get it. I'm a mexican boy who has never got the chance to go to Broadway, all I've seen are bootlegs, and they're fine but not like this. This is a beautiful shot of the great spectacle Hamilton is, the flawless music of Lin Manuel Miranda, the production, the photography, costumes. And the acting, Leslie Odom Jr., Renneè, Miranda and Daveed Diggs shine on their roles, I don't know is this can be nominated for any award, but damn it deserves it Just in time for the Fourth of July, Disney+ is doing a solid for anyone who couldn't get a ticket to the Broadway sensation known as "Hamilton." All 160 minutes of it, including a very brief intermission and some minor censoring of language, will be streaming on the service starting July 3rd. Shot over two nights in 2016 with most of the original cast, including all its Tony winners, this is more than just a filmed performance. Great care has gone into making this as cinematic as possible. The camerawork, editing and direction also bring the one thing you couldn't get at the Richard Rogers Theatre: a closeness that allows you to see the emotions (and the sweat) on the performers' faces. Director Thomas Kail (who also helmed the stage production) uses his close-ups judiciously, but manages to keep this level of intimacy even when we're able to see the entire stage and all its performers.<br/><br/>With its PG-13 rating, this is the most adult movie to appear behind the Walt Disney castle logo. It's certainly raunchy in ways Uncle Walt wouldn't have approved, most notably in depicting the adulterous events that led to the Reynolds pamphlet, a Sidney Sheldon-worthy tell-all published by its protagonist, Alexander Hamilton (Lin-Manuel Miranda). "Well, he never gonna be President now," sings Thomas Jefferson (Tony winner Daveed Diggs), a conceit that seems particularly quaint and hilarious when you consider who was elected to that office the year "Hamilton" won 11 Tonys and the Pulitzer Prize.<br/><br/>In fact, the timing of this release continues to put the musical in conversation with current events, specifically the recent spate of stories of people of color being delegitimized in, or completely left out of, boardrooms, writers' rooms and other places where decisions were made. When Aaron Burr (Tony winner Leslie Odom, Jr.) sings about wanting to be in the "room where it happens," the lyrics are accompanied by the deliberately loaded image of a Black man singing them. "Hamilton"'s casting of mostly Black, Latinx and Asian performers to portray real-life people we knew were White (and, lest we forget, slaveowners) is questionable only if one doesn't consider that a major theme of Miranda's book is not only who gets to tell this American story, but also that the subjects themselves don't really have any control over the storyteller. With the past few weeks filled with White voiceover artists voluntarily stepping aside to let Black artists voice their Black characters, I'm sure this casting conceit will be litigated once again in the whataboutism court of public opinion.<br/><br/>But I digress.<br/><br/>Since the "Hamilton" soundtrack has been on the charts since its release, a lot of viewers will finally have a visual context for the lyrics they know by heart. Starting with the opening number, "Alexander Hamilton," Miranda crams an ungodly amount of exposition and history into his lyrics, often using rap as a means to his end. Odom's Burr, the self-proclaimed "damn fool that shot" Hamilton and the cast detail the early years of our hero, tracing him from the Caribbean to New York City. It's our first look at Paul Tazewell's costume design and Howell Binkley's lighting, both of which will be showcased by cinematographer Declan Quinn and Kail's superb framing. We're also introduced to the main actors' voices, each distinct and wonderful in their own right. This opening, and other detail-filled songs, are to millennials what "Schoolhouse Rock" was to my generation, though ABC would have found this too dangerous to spring on us kids.<br/><br/>The greatness of Miranda's songs lies in the diversity of their musical styles and the choices he makes for each number. Since almost every word in the musical is sung, it's a lot of fun discovering what combination of rap, r&b, gospel and power ballad he'll employ. He gives the one truly old-school Broadway show tune, the catchy yet terrifying "You'll Be Back" to King George III (a deliciously snarky Jonathan Groff), as if symbolizing the difference between the old country and the scruffy colonists who are rebelling against it. Miranda effortlessly changes gears when he wants to reach for the larger emotional moments that resonate all the way to the back of the theater, most notably in the songs of the Schuyler sisters, Angelica (Tony winner Renée Elise Goldsberry), who pines for Hamilton and Eliza (Phillipa Soo), who marries him.<br/><br/>Again, the intimacy of Kail's camera works wonders here. The emotions on the actors' faces as they sing are so lovingly embraced, especially when they're pouring out their hearts. He captures the paternal love in Burr's eyes when he sings to the daughter he hopes to live long enough to see grow old. We're close enough to see Eliza's mind working as she wonders if she can compete with her husband's ambitions of not throwing away his shot. Angelica practically vibrates with love and protection for her younger sister. And every beautiful smirk of Diggs' face is captured, whether he's Lafayette in the first act or Thomas Jefferson in the second. As the latter, Diggs wears a purple outfit that looks lifted from one of Prince's Paisley Park walk-in closets.<br/><br/>As Hamilton, Miranda is excellent, giving himself a line about immigrants that's bound to stick in the craw of some people. He's in a carefully calibrated co-lead with the spectacular Odom. Burr wins the duel here, but Miranda is the show's MVP and its creative genius. The one place where "Hamilton" falters slightly-and I had this problem on Broadway as well-is in its depiction of George Washington. Christopher Jackson is wonderful in the role (my God, this man can sing) but while everyone else gets dinged enough to balance their legends with their humanity, Washington kind of gets a pass. He's seen reverentially, which works quite well with Jackson's larger-than-life portrayal, but whereas everyone else breaks free from the bland lessons I got in history class, Washington feels like he's still trapped in my textbook.<br/><br/>The viewer is always aware that this is a live production filmed with an enthusiastic audience. There's applause after every number, and in wide shots that capture the turntable portions of the set, we can occasionally see the audience and the orchestra pit. This adds a welcome "you are there" feeling to the proceedings. It's said that live theater is like catching lightning in a bottle in that every night is different and can never be repeated. It's nice to have a bit of that lightning at your disposal courtesy of this movie.<br/><br/>Even nicer is how the representation provided by the actors of color forces the viewer to consider what might have happened if people who looked like the performers were actually allowed to take part in crafting the American ideals and the laws of this then-burgeoning nation. Our ancestors built this country, and their descendants are still begging for equality, still fighting to be in the room where it happens. No matter how entertaining this iteration of "Hamilton" is-and it's massively entertaining-these ideas are always lurking nearby, demanding consideration. This was fantastic. A musical so amazingly done! The characters and singing are fantastic! Auto tune has taken over the music department but not with this! These are their real voices! 10/10! No one throw away their shot and please watch Hamilton! WOW speechless after watching this. A true masterpiece. After years of curiosity I can't believe it lived up to and surpassed the intense hype. It really is beyond special and I think everyone should see it. Profoundly moving and extremely entertaining. My number one favorite Broadway musical, 'Hamilton', is now on Disney+ and it looks like an epic masterpiece!<br/><br/>I first saw this in Chicago on October 2018 and I keep on listening to the songs all the time!<br/><br/>The cinematography (originally filmed in 2016) was magnificent; the original Broadway cast was incredibly talented; the songs that are from the original musical were phenomenal; and the story was delightful.<br/><br/>This is one epic musical that you will never forget! A must watch for any musical fan, history buff or anyone who can appreciate a modern day masterpiece. It's truly a challenge to shoot a live theatre production well and 'Hamilton' rises to that challenge. This is a must-see for theatre goers, history buffs and anyone who appreciates art. It's a masterpiece and a master class in storytelling. A great job by the cast and all the tech design that ties it all together. I have a love/hate relationship with musicals. I absolutely love The Lion King, Les Mis and Hamilton, and absolutely hate everything else. I know, it's weird. My sister is a theater kid, and used to blast Hamilton back in 2016. This is how I was introduced to Hamilton. At first I was annoyed, but the hiphop influences interested me in so I started to listen Hamilton by myself. Back then the only musical that I even tolerated was The Lion King. I fell in love with the music and the story. It made me want to visit the show. I have been to The Lion King multiple times and loved it each time, it's actually a huge part of my youth. But living in Europe, I couldn't just go out and buy a ticket for Hamilton. Instead I waited. And after 4 years of waiting, I was finally able to experience Hamilton in full. And let me tell you: it was worth it. Kinda makes Aladdin and Magnificent type of movies look silly, this show is the pursuit of excellence on every level. Multicultural brilliance from a Puerto Rican modern day Shakespeare. Mainstream media has made black and brown people look like fools they know how talented we are and this show boldly tells how beautiful our diverse complexions are, this masterpiece reminds me of a flower with all of its beautiful colors just like this amazing cast. Bravo. Hamilton is a masterpiece in every single sense of the word and in all of the genres it touches. It is a fascinating story, an exhilarating history lesson told through insanely great contemporary music and lyrics, all perfectly rhymed, making you feel all the feels. To be able to see it with the original cast, right there from the very best seats in the house is already a wonderful gift, but this film went beyond that and gave us close-ups, aerial views, cinematic pans, all without keeping us from missing the whole ensemble and letting us enjoy the subtleties in their performances. I (35) just watched this with my husband (40), my sister (24), and our daughters (18 & 7), and we all were mezmerized and BLOWN AWAY by this epicness!!!<br/><br/>There is no words big enough to describe this, just see it for yourself!<br/><br/>WOW!! I've listened to the soundtrack more times than I wish to admit. But wow this recording is amazing This is an epic production of the best Broadway show in the history of theater. It is a technical achievement, because it looks flawless and I really can't even describe how great the sound is. On a home theater, on headphones, on my iPad, everything, it sounds pristine. It sounds better than the soundtrack, which is saying something.<br/><br/>This is a must watch movie/show. It speaks to history as both a learning experience and something we shouldn't forget. The music is amazing and the lyrics and wordplay are second to none. Obviously I'm not breaking news here, Hamilton has been a sensation since it came out in 2015. Lin Manuel Miranda is a true genius and the world is a better place with him in it.<br/><br/>Still, this movie exceeded my very high expectations. And I speak as someone who has seen the show more than 20 times. The words amazing, fantastic, stunning aren't nearly good enough to explain and show the talent and geniuses of this story. Perfection can't even summarize how you feel and how the story of America is told. There has to be a new adjective,noun, or definition to explain something as great as Hamilton. To all whom took part in Hamilton hats down to you and bravo!<br/><br/>With much appreciation and gratitude,<br/><br/>-Ra'Lyn I had the opportunity to see the tour when it came to Dallas and was wildly in awe of the magnitude of the show. The OBC does it 20 times better! It's beautiful, energetic, emotional, and all of the above!! I will be watching this over and over again for the foreseeable future. The editing makes the it come alive and gives the feel of front row viewing. Loved it! What a fantastic movie adaptation of this amazing Stage show.
This is my daughter's favourite musical, and it is so easy to see why.
In this time when it isn't possible to see the show live, I can't think of a better way to spend Friday night with my family. This was completely perfect, loved it so much. Will re-watch many times. I've been keen to see Hamilton since it's opened but no performances in my country yet and couldn't spare the expense to travel overseas just to see a show. This met all my expectations. Took my love for the show even higher. I hope we can see more musicals done this way with the same cast that performs in the live show. After the awful abomination with the massive budget Cats film, this shows you don't need to go over the top with CGI and special effect to produce a fantastic musical film. Watched with my dad who had never seen or heard anything about the show, and he also thoroughly enjoyed it to the end. I hope Lin-Manuel Miranda has a few more musicals in him .... What a fantastic film, loved every moment of it. The music is incredible. This musical is by far one of the most inspiring, creative, playful and brilliantly crafted productions one can experience. If you're unable to see this live, this is the next best thing (probably better because you have original cast). The music and story of Hamilton will forever be at home on Broadway. However, not everyone can afford to attend a Broadway show, especially one as high profile as Hamilton.<br/><br/>That is where this stage recording of Hamilton comes into play. This stage recording makes it possible for many more to see this masterpiece of a musical performed by its original Broadway cast.<br/><br/>Some may claim the camera work is simplistic and that it doesn't quite feel like an authentic theater experience. Both can be valid criticisms, as a recording will never be the same as actually being in a seat in the Richard Rodgers theater, experiencing the show.<br/><br/>However, as someone privileged enough to have seen Hamilton at the Richard Rodgers Theater in person (Not the Original cast though!), I can say I felt nearly as much emotion from this stage recording as I did in person. That speaks volumes of the powerful music and story that Lin Manuel Miranda has created about the life of the Ten Dollar, Founding Father without a Father.<br/><br/>It is a beautiful thing that this stunning piece of Broadway can now be made available to the masses of the world through Disney Plus! I started to love 90s hip-hop thanks to Hamilton. My favourite musical. Lin-Manuel changed the musical theater paradygm Amazing, perfect story. Why pay 500 dollars when you could pay less than 10 dollars to watch this show. I honestly never thought i'd watch the play with the original cast, so i'm soooo happy to say that it has surpassed my expectations. I'll probably rewatch it a thousand times. The most in demand musical is now streaming on demand. Hamilton follows the founding of the United States through the War of Independence and foundational historical events up to 1804 through the perspective of Alexander Hamilton. The musical really packs a musical punch, there's really no dialogue outside of the songs and they combine your typical broadway music with rap, hip-hop, and jazz. Although the musical is about events that are centuries old, it's incredibly relevant to today. Lin-Manuel Miranda says "This is a story about America then, told by America now." An engaging powerhouse of a musical that really dives in to the human experience in an incredible and educational way.
Like many other broadway musicals, it deals with hard life issues and is not appropriate for younger viewers. Parents should be aware that the film earns the PG-13 rating mostly through cursing and sexual innuendo. We've got a full review, discussion guide, and more up on our blog now at Down the Hobbit Hole Blog dot com. It's really amazing how they managed to capture the live performances and bring it to the screen. Amazing. Felt like I was there. Why pay 500 dollar when you could pay less than 10 dollars a month and watch it whenevrr on here. Hamilton triumphs, breaking benchmarks with absolutely breathtaking song numbers and astounding performances, all while teaching competently about American History. Actually seeing the play is a lot different from just listening to the music it gives a whole new layer of feeling! And each one of the actors voices and faces you saw so much raw emotion, especially the parts with Eliza. The way she manipulated her emotions to show sadness through the song burn was intense! You will laugh, you will cry, and you should definitively watch this. I started watching this out of curiosity and to say I have seen it, being the cultural touchstone that it is. At first, I was a little detached, not liking the songs too much, and thinking I would probably just skip through to end in a minute. I couldn't stop watching and it really sucked me in. I have to say, I'm not sure I would have enjoyed it at all, live in the theater. I benefited greatly from the captions and the ability to put it on pause to consult Wikipedia from time to time. The lyrics were so clever and really told the story. I ended up very moved and almost cheering at the end. Of course, now that I am familiar with the story, I would love to see it live and would enjoy it immensely. But I would strongly recommend this for a first time viewing. I will definitely re-watch. And probably again and again. I can't argue against this rating. It's so good! The acting, the book, the direction, the choreography, everything about it is amazing. Lin-Manuel Miranda and the spectacular cast Amazes me every time. Outstanding show from the original cast, especially Leslie Odom Jr with his powerful voice and emotional performance.
A great watch for all who appreciate talent and impressive singing, choreography and acting.
Lin is a genius. I was fortunate enough to see Hamilton 3 times in Chicago, including once from the second row thanks to a friend winning the lottery. How did this compare? WAY better than I expected, honestly. I noticed new moments. I saw the original cast in a new light. I experienced the story like I was onstage. There's nothing quite like being in the theater, but this may be the closest a film crew ever got to capturing theater magic. (I wish the RENT movie had been a recording of a 1996 production...) Hamilton represents a unique moment in American theatre, and I'm grateful someone captured it. I loved the cast album, but nothing prepared me for the depth and emotion of seeing the play on film. Brilliant in so many ways! I am so glad this was recorded with the original cast for all to see! This was really good and it met my expectations then exceeded them Couldn't get tickets to see on Broadway, wanted to see what all they hype was about... just another fad? What's the big deal? So I wanted to experience it for myself - thank you Disney+ !!! All I can say is believe the hype, it's true! This is a magical, fresh take on the musical. A breath of fresh air. About a quarter into watching my husband came home and I looked at him and said this is special you gotta see this, he said he wasn't interested but sat down to play on his phone, read emails, etc but when I looked up at him several minutes later he was transfixed watching it, so even the most cynical musical hating dude couldn't keep from watching and enjoying it. I feel like this isn't a good review but it's hard to put into worlds the joyful feeling we got while watching. And Groff as King George - loved it!!! I have listened to the soundtrack for the past couple of Years and LOVED IT!
I've seen it at the 3 times Pantages in LA ( season tickets) Won tickets to San Diego thru Hamilton App Lottery. Saw it in Chicago And San Francisco for Anniversaries! Each Production Wonderful! Seeing it with the Original Cast on Disney is like Icing on the Cake! Thanks Lin for getting it to Us sooner than Waiting til next year!
The Lyrics are So Relevant Now! Big fan of the soundtrack and I saw I in person. The movie was better because you get a better than front row seat. It's an amazing American story told with a perfect soundtrack. I don't know if this musical movie will ever be surpassed. As a major film fan this does not disappoint. Lin Manuel Miranda does an incredible job and Hamilton himself. Supporting crew members such as Phillipa Soo, Christoper Jackson, Daveed Diggs etc perform solidly from beginning to end with a flawless performance. I cannot recommend this enough, you will laugh, you will cry, you will sing along. Do not throw away your shot, get watching Hamilton now! Was really excited to watch this considering all the hype but honestly the music just wasn't for me. Thanks to Disney+, I am desperate to see the live stage show.
The talent involved in this production is world class.
Well done all associated with this masterpiece.
Love it I never got to see the onstage version and was truly disappointed that I never would with the original cast but this is a dream come true! The lyrics, music, lighting, casting, and choreography is faultless and it really does immerse you into the story! I hope that other musicals follow this and make stage productions into films for the masses because this really is one of a kind! Well and truly satisfied and blessed to see this with the original cast! Just perfect. 4 years waiting... and just perfect. Never believe the hype. I didn't believe it. For years I had heard so much about a play about of all people Alexander Hamilton-but done to rap or something similar? Can't be good and maybe offensive. But then the noise of its greatness never quieted. So when it finally came to my town I had to see it. But first I listened to the soundtrack. I was hooked. Despite mezzanine seating I was floored how good the play was. I repeated the soundtrack. Day after day and the message became clearer. News of a movie but then a live taping with the original cast. I couldn't wait. Up close made all the lyrics more amazing. The story was better than I recalled. Outstanding performances. I truly loved it. 10/10. Immediately started watching it for a second time. I have heard the soundtrack several times and I watched it live in San Francisco but nothing, nothing compares to watching the original cast. I knew what would happen and I still cried. Exhilarating, fantastic music, exceptional lyrics, moving and extremely satisfying!
The people that don't like it, just don't get it and well, I feel sorry for them. To each its own.
You must pay close attention so you don't miss any of the lyrics.
Brilliant!!! A masterpiece that delivered every bit of energy that you feel when you're there on Broadway. Bravo! I've been waiting for so long to see this. It's fantastic! Lin Manuel is incredible along with the rest of the cast. So much damn talent!! Fantastic cast brilliant music brilliant stage and scenery. This record breaking show was even better than I imagined. So glad to have seen the original cast performance. Everything's perfect. It appeals to all age groups and all types of people. Love the rap music incorporated into this master piece It's great even for people who don't like musicals and love history when Alexander and Eliza got married I screamed it a Beautiful movie/musical has a great ending so I recommend I really enjoyed this.<br/><br/>Lyn-Manuel Miranda is widely and deservedly regarded as a genius and this musical/film adds more evidence to support that.<br/><br/>Clever, funny, rapid-fire lyrics blend with an (until this musical was created) under regarded figure of US history. But his genius is even more evident in his decision to pitch a musical where most of the white historical cast are portrayed by Black American performers... with hip hop music at its spine. Originality is king if you want to make memorable art.<br/><br/>The cast in this production are luminescent. They may not all be names theatre goers will readily recognise but you've seen many of them on TV and film. There's even a key figure played by a semi-regular from Glee (singing a song that sounded very Tim Minchin to me).<br/><br/>As a huge fan of musicals I was always going to like this. The flip-side of this is that I judged it against the others I've seen and loved.<br/><br/>So yes, its hands don at least 8 stars (and most people say more than that, and that's fine) but some of the things I regarded as flaws held me back.<br/><br/>Relationships - no real kick-arse relationships of emotional depth except for the one who dies midway through the second act. And while it was portrayed and told well, I felt it failed to resonate as much as it could have by the lack of foreshadowing the bond. The relationship with his wife seemed tacked on and the hinted relationship with another woman (won't add a spoiler here) never delivered. The fact it was never established as fact in the real life story of Hamilton was no doubt part of the reason, but including the hint that goes nowhere served little purpose.<br/><br/>The story - Some stories are light by nature (Grease, Little Shop of Horrors) but they at least have a powerful relationship at their base. Some are significant because of the story they cover (Les Mis, Rent)... and they also mostly have a powerful relationship or two in the midst. I know the purpose of telling Hamilton's story was to share details of an almost forgotten figure, but I kinda feel like he deserved to be forgotten. Definitely an intellect, but his role in the War of Independence was bureaucratic, his additions to legislature were significant, but again bureaucratic. If they had hung some of the story on a significant moment rather than to provide a greatest hits package of his life, maybe there was more power to be had? Having seen it and enjoyed it, I still wonder "why Hamilton?"<br/><br/>Anyway, those are just some of my personal misgivings and I DID love the film/musical. Miranda is the genius in this case and while it's very easy for people on the sideline, like me, to critique or fiddle with the idea, there's no idea at all without his amazing mind.<br/><br/>You really should see this. What a treat to watch the OG cast. I've seen it twice on broadway. It's a revolutionary musIcal This a unique and amazing way to portray the history of this country. From the second the musical begins it captures your attention. You feel like you're there, witnessing history. The songs stay with you from beginning to end. The cast is just outstanding and the choreography is superb. Lin-Manuel Miranda is a genius. Immaculately crafted, phenomenal performances, amazing energy, and beautiful story telling - Hamilton is a MASTERPIECE! I saw Hamilton in Chicago and Kansas City and was blown away by each performance. As excited as I was to see the original cast, I was skeptical to watch a filmed performance. IMHO It. Was. Perfect. Just let yourself fall into the show-it's so easy to do. I laughed, I cried, I sang, I danced. Just sit back and enjoy this incredible experience. Have nothing to say except you have to watch this ! If you are like me and you never got to see Hamilton on Broadway, do yourself the favor and watch it on Disney+. This amazing show completely surpassed my expectations... and my expectations were pretty damn high. History. Hip Hop. Amazing storytelling. Top notch performances by the entire cast, every detail in the production contributed to the spectacular overall performance. I've never seen Hamilton. I've never heard Hamilton's songs. After hearing all the buzz about this musical about a founding father (of all the topics they could choose) for five years, I decided to spend the beginning of my 4th of July weekend watching Hamilton.<br/><br/>Was it good?<br/><br/>No.<br/><br/>...It was great. Amazing. I was actually blown away by how good it was. The songs are catchy (the lyrics and flow are just 10/10), the performances are brilliant, there's nothing not to like about Hamilton.<br/><br/>I'm currently looking up everything I can about Hamilton.<br/><br/>I think I'm a fan now! There never has, is nothing, and will never be anything like this GEM of a musical and piece of art. Not only is it an incredibly accurate and powerful musical, but the cast... KILLS IT. The standouts are Leslie Odom Jr. as Aaron Burr and Phillipa Soo as Eliza Hamilton, but everyone else gets their chance to shine and rises up to make this musical a piece of art that WILL stand the test of time. Lin-Manuel Miranda is a genius and has a mind like no other and his great work should and will be applauded for generations to come.<br/><br/>P.S. Jonathan Groff as King George is utter perfection in every sense of the word. Having seen the play and loving it, I was set for a disappointment. No chance. With the one limitation of being confined to a screen, the portraya was extremely well done. With a minimum of close-ups, the filming of the staging worked well. The sound was very good, few words lost. Since this was the original cast, we got to see the thing at its best. I will leave it to others to get into the plot details. I was intrigued from beginning to end. I do not care much for theater. Especially filmed theater. But at the time I saw Hamilton in Chicago, I rated it as one of, if not the greatest pieces of art I'd ever experienced.<br/><br/>It remains so in its filmed form. Hamilton is original! Easy to follow & beautifully written - the acting and singing was phenomenal too - - classic Could never justify the price of the tickets. Can't imagine how incredible it would have been to see the original cast live. What an incredible production. Highly recommend everything about this. The music is incredible- just watch it. Why does Lin Manuel Miranda have to star in absolutely everything he writes. I struggled to enjoy this due to feeling that Manuel Miranda's vocals and performance were inferior compared to the rest of the stellar cast. He just doesn't fit the character. He ruined every scene he was in.
The rest of the cast were wonderful. This is a very well done production. It feels like you are in the theater with the audience, but with even better seats! This is a spectacular film with catchy musical numbers, a compelling plot, and a sense of patriotism desperately needed right now! A few minor gripes:
James Madison was our shortest president at 5'4''. The actor they chose to play him is easily 6 ft. That took me out of it a bit. But this is a very emotionally powerful film that makes you appreciate this country and how much the Founding Fathers sacrificed to give us our freedom
Grade: A- 9/10 4/5 stars 5 years of social media posts lambasting Lin-Manuel Miranda for exorbitant theater prices rewarded with FRONT row for mere $6.99. Once in a lifetime ensemble of performers at the top of their game. It lived up to the hype and alot more I could feel the energy though the screen!<br/><br/>The acting was very incredible and moving.<br/><br/>More musicals should be done like this! I respect the material that was conveyed but unfortunately, musically, not my thing. I'm not a fan of hip hop so why would I want to listen to over 2 hours of it. It's almost a non stop beat the entire time. Even then so, it looked like it was average. No vibrant backdrops. The costumes were okay. I turned it off half way through.. I enjoy more traditional musicals. Phantom and such. This was my first time watching the play. I'm a history buff. I'm also a Lloyd-Weber fan.<br/><br/>This was a disappointment. I guess my first gripe is the soundtrack. It's just non-stop thumping. It gets monotonous. The 'I'm not satisfied' number is well performed but goes on too long. The sets are unambitious. Costumes look nice but why not add some color to the view? The lead actor doesn't fill the shoes of the character he's trying to portray. Sorry.<br/><br/>With all the hype this has received, I'm quite surprised by my reaction to it. The actors made an effort and were good for the most part, but the writing is horrible. The songs make no sense. Lin-Manuel is a great rapper, he is not a Broadway singer. His voice was one of the worst voices I have heard from a musical. However, Leslie Odom, Burr, has one of the best voices I have heard from a musical. My second problem with the production is how historically liberal they were with the story of Hamilton's life. It really made me mad how John Adams was barely mentioned and only mentioned negatively. Adams and Hamilton were 2 of the leaders of the Federalist Party. It wasn't until Adams became President that the 2 separated and tore the party in 2 factions.
King George was the best part of the play. In a play portraying so many founding fathers, it is sad that a British monarch was the best part. We have shared many moments watching this ubiquitous contraception found in each of our homes. Many a World Series, so many Super Bowls, the Olympics... Roots, The Wire, The Sopranos, Game of Thrones... none eclipse this moment when Broadway, history & television collided, in our living rooms on the eve of the birthday of our country, during social unrest & unprecedented uncertainty. Bravo to the entire production, bravo to Disney+ for bringing this masterpiece to each of us. We are eternally grateful. One of the untraditional musicals I have ever seen. The actors who played their parts were superb. Not a fan of rap but my mind is open. I don't care how this Hamilton is iconic to Americans, but what I have just watched or "tried to watch" was dreadful! Bad singers, so loud and annoying, too long, mostly modern rap with old costumes and characters with no resemblance! Mind my rating guys and this is a Disney failure indeed. Those who rewrite history are doomed to repeat it.<br/><br/>The writer/star is awful.
Hours of rap music gets far too boring.
Broadway has nothing going for it anymore so it glorifies this trash. I feel these criticisms are not trivial, they are musical/storytelling/songwriting fundamentals<br/><br/>1. With very few exceptions, the songs that aren't just rapping have very little melody. It's almost like if you gave someone a page of dialogue and said "instead of saying this, make it into a song on the spot". It really often feels like there's that little planning put into the melody structure. Contrast that with the music in The Book of Mormon, where nearly every song is an earworm, and incredibly well written.<br/><br/>2. Add to that the lyrics themselves, same thing. If you told me the show was improvised on the spot (Which is exactly what Lin did with his group Freestyle Love Supreme) then I could be impressed. But it's not. Lin had time to pre-write this. They're so basic, and repeat SO much. I can't believe the quality of writing choruses like "I want to be in the room where it happened, the room where it happened, the room where it happened". Look at the lyrics to The Story of Tonight:
I may not live to see our glory
I may not live to see our glory
But I will gladly join the fight
But I will gladly join the fight
And when our children tell our story
And when our children tell our story
They'll tell the story of tonight
Let's have another round tonight
Let's have another round tonight
Let's have another round tonight
Raise a glass to freedom
Something they can never take away
No matter what they tell you
Raise a glass to the four of us
Tomorrow there'll be more of us
Telling the story of tonight
They'll tell the story of tonight
Raise a glass to freedom
Something they can never take away
No matter what they tell you
Let's have another round tonight
Raise a glass to the four of us
Tomorrow there'll be more of us
Telling the story of tonight
Let's have another round tonight
They'll tell the story of tonight
Raise a glass to freedom
They'll tell the story of tonight
Raise a glass to freedom
They'll tell the story of tonight
They'll tell the story of tonight<br/><br/>They just repeat themselves so much, it's so hard to stay engaged with lyrics like this. You find this throughout the show.<br/><br/>3. In Lin you have a man you cannot sing surrounded by phenomenal Broadway singers and it is jarring. If he wanted to put the quality of his play first he wouldn't have taken the lead role.<br/><br/>4. This is a story that is complex, covering numerous historical figures, events, policies, court cases, places and dates. And you choose to rap it? It makes it incredibly difficult to catch all of the information they're firing off. I didn't want to but I ended up having to keep the subtitles on.<br/><br/>5. Finally, in my opinion, even if this wasn't rap or even a musical, just scenes, I don't feel like it was a cohesive, well paced or structured story/choice of scenes to represent Hamilton's story. It jumps around so much, to different time periods and events. Now suddenly a whole song about some other character who just got introduced halfway through the show. it just felt scattered. Telling the story a man's whole life that was surrounded by so many consequential historical events is a titanic undertaking. It takes an incredible amount dedication and thought and talent. Knowing what it essential to keep in the story, and what should be shed. Where the focus should lie. I like Lin, been a fan since his early appearances in Collegehumor videos, I just feel unequivocally that he did not succeed in pulling this off.<br/><br/>To me kind of an exception and the highlight of the show is like 15min in: The Schuyler Sisters and their song. Those three were great together. Special shoutout to Peggy, who kind of stole the show with like 4 lines. Watched this because it was constantly in the news. I generally don't like musicals, to much yelling and shrieking voice. Hamilton is a turning point: superb acting, great lines, shifting types of music from rap to blues and fantastic performances. I am still puzzled how the actors memories all the lines, unreal!!! This musical is a Masterpiece from New York City to the world. It's amazing watching them perform. Happy 4th of July I wanted to like this. I like musicals and I love rap music. But I couldn't stand this!! Made it to 40 minutes before I ran away.<br/><br/>The rap music is pretty damn weak. The beats are so simple, sound like they were made by some actor on GarageBand. Oh wait, I think they were. Such repetitive and boring beats.<br/><br/>The rapping was pretty crappy. More like 2hr40 of spoken word over crappy beats.<br/><br/>The only endearing part was the King. He is the 2 stars I give. Otherwise, thank god we didn't pay to see this in theaters. Terrible musical about the founding fathers. Rewrites history. Poorly acted. Lame music. Centrist corporate liberal propaganda. If you like rap and music like that, welcome to heaven. If you really don't like rap, welcome to hell.<br/><br/>Ok but for real though I don't understand what's so appealing about.....any if this. Managed to make it through abiut 70 minutes and then decided it was either turn it off or bore my ear drums out with a drill. I've watched it 4 times since it was released on Disney plus and every time I find something new to be amazed at. Truly a work of art and lives up to all the hype! I did NOT want to shell out hundreds of dollars for tickets to see this live, but after seeing it on Disney+, I'm regretting not spending the money. The film production was fantastic, but I wish I had a chance to be in the audience before 'Rona came around... The storytelling and blending of old and new is unparalleled. All of history should be presented by Lin Manuel Miranda in musical form.
And Daveed Diggs is HILARIOUS. Hamilton definitely lived up to its hype and is such an amazing musical for all ages !!! Admittedly, my feeling on broadway musicals is I either love them or I'm totally bored in them. I can't say I've ever felt lukewarm about one. People have repeatedly assured me I would love this, just as I was assured I would love Phantom of the Opera...and, I didn't. I appreciate all the creativity, time, and effort, and maybe if I had seen this in NYC instead of on Disney+ mayyyybe I would feel differently? And maybe if I'd seen it with the cast that replaces Lin Manuel and his trio who clearly are not stage actors, maybe I would like this. I do typically like the dude who plays Yohan in Black-ish, I just felt him, Lin, the guy who played Burr, and their fourth guy, were not captivating, and I couldn't understand half of what they were saying.<br/><br/>On the plus, the women were great. They had spectacular voices, colorful outfits that popped on stage, and they had dynamic presence. The King and Washington were also great, and it was apparent by their performances they were stage pros with dynamic voices and stage presence. The title song is catchy and I liked that performance. I liked their Zoom performance of the title song on Some Great News. I thought that was great.<br/><br/>But, I also have never enjoyed a broadway play put on the big screen like a play...with the exception of Chorus Line. I walked out of Les Miserables movie, hated Chicago movie. I like when they turn it into a story with the music, like, Rent, Mama Mia (which I thought I would hate), Little Shop of Horrors, Grease, Annie (both versions), etc.<br/><br/>If someone paid for my ticket and the trip to NYC, I would consider seeing Hamilton live and giving it an honest shot, but I would much rather see the Tina Turner story or Sponge Bob, to be quite honest. I think a hip hop biopic, I would see that. Hip hop revolutionary history...eh. I would rather watch a History Channel in-depth of Hamilton or deep dive historical podcast. There just seems so many fun avenues to present hip hop into Broadway. I did like the diverse cast. Broadway, Hollywood and publishing should work on being more accepting and doing more of that. And when I say more accepting I mean showing POC and LGBTQ in a positive light and not in a way to highlight how benevolent straight white people are or just how bad they feel about oppressing us. I think I've had about enough of that. After years and years listening to people in movies/shows/live tv talking about having tickets or not being able to find the tickets for Hamilton i got the feeling that it will be something special to watch. Being on the other side of the world it never cross my mind i will be watching it. And this things barely make it out to where i am, specially not unless is dubbed... which probably will be a Catastrophe.
So when i heard Lin-Manuel Miranda saying it will be released on Disney+ I couldn't believe it. Thank you for that.<br/><br/>About the show: it delivers and more. I had a blast watching it, time went by so fast. You won't regret it. It was done beautifully. It was enjoyed deeply. I've been fortunate enough to see the musical in London And will see it again in Sydney next year. Hat off to the team that filmed this as every detail is captured in 4K, multi-angled and you feel like you've got the best seats in the house to this extraordinary musical. It's a must watch! If you love Musicals you will love this one. Not only does it school you on a lot, but the way it's played was amazing. My husband and I watched it without wanting to look away at all. The music is great the way it's sung, well preformed by all actors. I can't say enough good things about this play! Watch and see what I'm talking about. I wanted to see this on broadway and so did my husband, I'm am great-full I finely got to see it. One sad thing I had to watch it home. It was all I had wished and more! I somehow stayed on the outskirts of all the hype when this came out - mostly because you couldn't hope to get a ticket to see the original cast. I love LMM and his style and figured this would be amazing, but I didn't even try to listen to the soundtrack - it felt like it would be an incomplete experience without also seeing it. So I let it go. Until yesterday. This was like me walking into the theater in 2016 with no knowledge except that I heard it was great and something about "my shot"... MY GOD. I was stupefied. Enthralled. Enchanted. Entertained. Riveted from beginning to end (and it's not short). I laughed, I cried, I grooved, I sang. I marveled at the choreography and staging. I've watched it twice in 24 hours and bought the soundtrack (I'm so glad I waited to see it first- I feel so LUCKY to have seen it!). It's brilliant. A work of genius, truly. Greetings again from the darkness. You know what it's like when people start talking about some great new restaurant that just opened (think back to pre-pandemic)? And then you start to hear your friends and co-workers raving about it ... best 'steamed broccoli' (ok, insert your favorite entrÃ©e) I've ever tasted! Having been burned many times with high expectations, you remain skeptical, but make the reservation. Well, that's been me with "Hamilton." For almost 5 years, the hype was just too much. Surely folks were caught up in the frenzy, and peer pressure was such that no one would admit it wasn't all that. So, now I'm here ... throwing myself at the mercy of the Theater Gods. Thanks to Disney Plus, I only needed to invest a little (ok, a lot) of time, rather than a few hundred dollars for a ticket. This is me humbly admitting I was wrong. The show is fantastic, and I only wish my first viewing had been a live performance.<br/><br/>Unfortunately (because of what I mentioned above) this can't be a comparison of a live stage performance and the film version. Instead, this will briefly outline what I noticed in the movie. First, and I believe this is key, the original stage director Thomas Kail is back to direct the film. It should be noted that the film version is a blend of a couple of recorded live shows, plus some recorded songs seamlessly edited in. This is the original cast doing what they do best, and the edits are imperceptible. Second, the main cast is filled with dynamic performers. In many stage shows, one or two actors are head and shoulders above the others. Not so here. At a minimum the top seven actors are as skilled and fun to watch as any you've seen. Third, this is a true musical in that the songs drive the story. Some of the early songs require serious concentration to catch the lines, but even if you miss some lyrics, the gist of what's happening is pretty clear. These aren't so much catchy sing-along types, but you'll easily recall the scenes when you hear the songs again at a later date. We see a perfect melding of music-performance-story.<br/><br/>Of course most everyone knows that Lin-Manuel Miranda is the creative force behind the show. He credits writer Ron Chernow's book on Alexander Hamilton as the inspiration for the production, but it's Mr. Miranda that appeared on every talk show for a couple of years, and he also performs as Alexander Hamilton. Daveed Diggs has dual roles as the flamboyant Marquis de Lafayette and the equally flamboyant (at least here) Thomas Jefferson. Renee Elise Goldsberry takes over the stage with her powerful voice as Angelica Schuyler, and Chris Jackson is a dominating physical presence as George Washington. Jonathan Groff (from "Mindhunter") is absolutely hysterical and unforgettable as King George III, both through song and strut. Everyone will have their favorite performers, and truly they are all exceptional, and I'd like to point out the two that took my breath away. Phillipa Soo as Eliza Hamilton has a pristine voice that will bring tears to many eyes. She may not be as involved with the political elements of the story, but in the most emotional moments, she is front and center. Lastly, the passion Leslie Odom Jr brings to his role as Adam Burr is beyond description. He may be the "villain", but he makes Burr accessible and easy to understand ... plus Odom is a terrific singer and performer, and he lights up the stage.<br/><br/>It's easy to overlook the dance and stage choreography since it's never over-the-top, but the dancers are terrific and the performers make great use of the single set - although props are regularly brought in and taken away. Perhaps what really makes this click as movie entertainment is the expert use of cameras and editing. We see the full stage when we should, and we are offered close-ups when it's most effective. I do hope to catch the live show at some point, but if my Hamilton experience is limited to this cinematic version, well ... "that would be enough." Everything was amazing. I love that this is simply a high quality filming of the on stage production. I fear so much would be lost in production if made into a motion picture. A good example of this would be The Greatest Showman. Wow! Although I was late to experience this wonderful piece of art, nontheless I'm glad I got to experience it. Thank you everyone involved for creating this special project. I saw Hamilton once, after the original cast had left, and it was amazing, but this was a dream come true. I've seen it twice in two days. The cast, the music, the production... it's perfect. Something I will be watching again tomorrow. You don't need to be a history buff (or even be all that familiar with American history) to appreciate and love this musical because it is about so much more than U.S. history and politics. This show has heart and that's what makes this extraordinary. Pros:<br/><br/>Lin-Manuel Miranda... *Insert Clapping and Standing Ovation*. He was seemingly crafted this show and he has done a tremendous job<br/><br/>The writing of the songs is fantastic and they are soooo catchy<br/><br/>Set design was brilliant and seeing this stage production through a camera was really enticing and left me wanting more<br/><br/>Funny in parts, sad in others. I felt 'Hamilton' had a great balance<br/><br/>Performances by everyone was fantastic... words don't do it justice<br/><br/>Lafayette - Hilarious<br/><br/>Cons<br/><br/>Not many... But I did become a little confused with some plot points, that may have just been me though<br/><br/>Overall, I thought 'Hamilton' was an absolute blast. The songs, performances were truly amazing and I will be listening to the soundtrack for a while now! Hats off to Lin-Manuel Miranda because he has crafted this from the ground and wrote the lyrics to the songs and the script. Honestly it is a fantastic achievement for him. I've never been a massive fan of musical theatre but 'Hamilton' has proved to me that there are some gems out there. I hope Disney or other companies release future productions on streaming sites because I can guarantee 'Hamilton' will be a wide success.<br/><br/>Quote - "I'm not throwing away my shot" - Alexander Hamilton<br/><br/>Rating - 9/10 I am not even a fan of musicals, but this is excellent. The songs are great, as they are upbeat and modern. The production, acting, stage set up and the story are all great. I really enjoyed it. This was well worth all the hype it's received over the years. There are so many reviews commenting on prominent characters being used twice who are missing the fact that acts I and II feature a bunch of different, new characters. It's common in musicals for actors/actresses to be used in multiple roles -otherwise the cast for each show would be massive. For the people commenting about hip hop and such diversity being incorrect for the timeframe, it's also helpful to Google why Lin Manuel Miranda set this to the tune of hip hop with a diverse cast -it's done with intent. Hamilton is like...watching something your history teacher put together to make the "urban" kids engage. It's the cultural equivalent of a loud fart in a library. Like, could you not? Couldn't understand any words. Most annoying thing I've ever heard. Made it wait 10 minutes in. 👎🏻 Absolutely brilliant, there's no need to say anything else. A must see. Can't wait to see it again I almost never write reviews on here but I watched the recording of Hamilton over 24 hours ago and I think I'm still feeling the emotional impact of it. I can't lie, I was one of the diehard fans of this show in 2016, and my mum and I used to listen to the soundtrack together all the time so when we saw that this recording was being released we were super excited even though it's been ages since we were properly into the show. I was kind of nervous going into watching it because I was worried it might not live up to expectations but I had nothing to fear. The live vocals of most of the performers were somehow even better than they were on the cast recording, and seeing the staging made me appreciate certain songs more than I ever had in the past. Had to subscribe to Disney+ for a month to see it but it was well worth it, even though they bleeped a couple of the swear words. A beautiful viewing experience I would recommend to anyone, whether they're a fan of the show or not. Just genius. Seen musicals before. Staged ones too. My partner and me love theatre. In Poland we have theatres like everywhere else. There is one though in my area that specializes in producing old stuff in modern way. The music, the costumes, the language, the scenography and all that one considers the generally understood theatre. Much of it musicals. Well, this one is a must-see for anybody with brains and sensitivity. Therefore I will only repeat myself here - just genius! I don't get it. Is there a reason we need to change the nationality of people from the past? How would MLK, Gandhi, and Malcolm X like to be played by WHITE PEOPLE??? Clearly whomever made this has a really strange agenda. Had to stop 20 min in. after all of the sexual innuendos. YIKES. Overall it is not very impressive, and way overhyped. The writer feels a need to denigrate other more well known founding fathers in order to prop up his guy. It mocks John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, without whom there wouldn't have been a Declaration of Independence to begin with. Even Washington seemed to be clueless unless the great Alexander Hamilton was advising him. It's very New York centric which probably explains why it's so popular on Broadway.
Musically, I guess it was ok but not really anything I would normally listen to.
There are many other broadway shows I would recommend over this one. Hamilton - last night, I settled in to watch Hamilton and within moments, I was nodding my head along with the hip-hop-inspired musical.
I wasn't raised on Broadway. I am not familiar with a lot of musicals besides Phantom (which I've seen a million times) and Les Mis (about the same).
So that's my limited experience.
But this was mindblowing.
The complex lyrics - forcing me to pay attention to everything that was spoken or sung, held me breathless for the almost three-hour set.
The cast of characters from Alexander Hamilton to Aaron Burr, from Lafayette to George Washington was incredible.
Throughout the story you see the growing animosity between Hamilton and Burr fester.
Meanwhile, you see a very complicated man in Alexander Hamilton - you see his humanity.
You see him rise and you see his fall and everything in between.
From awe-inspiring moments to portions that made me laugh out loud, (Mrs. Washington naming her Tom Cat after Alexander Hamilton), and portions that made me weep (It's quiet uptown) I did not walk away from this unmoved.
"Forgiveness, can you imagine?" was probably the holiest thing I've heard uttered in my entire 39 years of life. There was mercy, there that took my breath away.
Dealing with issues of war, slavery, immigration, and loyalty - this show was captivating.
Most of all - Lin Manuel Miranda drove home the point that historical figures such as Hamilton and others were very much human. In exposing their flaws, their great deeds shine ever more the brighter.
Gods' profundity is mundane. Human being's moments of profundity are sublime.
A true Tour De Force that was unique in its storytelling ability that kept me on the edge of my seat. I am not a fan of musicals, but the rapping to the music made it so much more entertaining. Plus, it really felt like you were there First off im a HUGE theater nerd im lucky to live in NYC ("the greaest city in the world") and ive seen a pelothra of broadway shows. (obviously hamilton tops the list) When ive heard they were going to make a film of the live staging i couldnt wait till 2021 (thanks disney!) Ive seen the show live although not with its original cast and let me be the first to say THIS SHOW TOPS THE CURRENT BROADWAY VERSION. the production crew is flawless making us the viewer see emotions and angles you weren't able to see live besides the fact that the orignal cast KICKS any other form of hamilton. You see Lin manuel miranda and leslie odom jr's literal tears as they were acting! I honestly say that i enjoyed this filmed version of the show than the current broadway show. 10 stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Since I first heard the official Soundtrack I wished for this recording. And it is even better than the Soundtrack. Literally the best Musical of all times. This is am amazing show telling the story of how Alexander Hamilton came from nothing to become a founding father. Living in Australia I haven't had the chance to see the musical but this movie surpassed all my expectations, it left me speechless and from the moment Jonathan Groff's voice could be heard as King George III I couldn't look away! It was amazing, brilliant and unbelievable - the best thing I've seen. I gave up after the first song - it was awful ! Musical stars are supposed to be the best singers you can get. You watch a musical partly for the theatre and partly for their amazing talent. The actors in this musical had none of that ! During musicals even when the lines are spoken, they are crisp and clear. In this they were just mumbled and rushed. The actors singing voices were very sub par.<br/><br/>This isn't a musical - it lacked everything a decent musical is ! I have no idea why so many people thought it was great. I can only assume they have never seen the truly great musicals such as Joseph, Phantom of the Opera, The Lion King and Kiss me Kate !! 20 minutes of this production was all I could bear. It was absolutely the most excruciating 20 minutes of my life. I fell in love with Hamilton a few years ago when my daughter was obsessed with the soundtrack and played it all the time in the car. Unfortunately I never got to see it on Broadway and by the time it came to Philadelphia the original cast was long gone. Instead of making big elaborate movie versions of musicals that usually suck they should take a page from Hamilton. I have a huge crush on Daveed Diggs and he owned the stage when he was both Marquis de Lafayette and Thomas Jefferson. Jonathan Groff is unforgettable as the evil King George of England. I also love Chris Jackson as General George Washington. First off, I love going to musicals. I have seen over 50 of them live in the theater. Quite a few others from the movies that were made it from them. The first surprise from this showing, Lin-Manuel Miranda was the worst one on the stage. The cast was awesome, except for him. He was the creator but should've put somebody else in the lead. The other thing that turned me off was the not so subtle jabs at the political party that Lin-Manuel Miranda doesn't like. There were plenty. The final thing that turned me off was the revisionist history in this show. I don't want to say none of it was true, but it was definitely someone's version of what they thought. Kind of like Jerry Krause taking credit for the Bulls winning 6 titles. Sorry Michael Jordan in hoops, and George Washington(and even Aaron Burr) in history would disagree. The US history classes I took barely mentioned Hamilton. He was definitely there. As were countless others than formed our country. When this came out I wondered why they chose a semi-obscure person as their hero. Final summation, I enjoyed the music and almost all of the actors. But I doubt I'll watch it again. I'm really glad I didn't spend 300 bucks on tickets. Junk don't know what else to say to this stupid ........ Just watched Hamilton on Disney +.
Yuck!
Its historically inaccurate (to be kind) and apparently Broadway musicals no longer require the lead to be able to sing. He just raps and chants.
To be sure there are some truly wonderful performances; King George, Thomas Jefferson, Madison and Aaron Burr plus the wife and her older sister Angelica.
Listen to the soundtrack but don't waste 2hrs 40 mins. As a hardcore musical theater buff and by extension a HUGE Hamilton nerd, I cannot begin to express how much of a literal dream come true this pro-shot was! I got to see the touring cast in Oregon a couple of years back and even though it was amazing to see it in theater, even that has it's disadvantages as I was sitting in $300 "cheap seats" in the back. I've always wanted to see the original Broadway Cast live but couldn't afford it/travel to see it since it was sold out and the cast members started retiring their roles. So when it was announced we were getting this pro-shot, I PARTIED!<br/><br/>The cast members gave wonderful performances as expected and I was super excited to see them all shine. Maybe it's just me, but those shaky bootlegs of the OBC have been so engraved in my head so much that it's kinda strange seeing everything and everyone close up in HD. I think the best thing this pro-shot did was highlight the CHOREOGRAPHY! I knew it was amazing from seeing the pre-released show clips back in 2015, but in here you can really take the time to appreciate it more.<br/><br/>If the cast singing sounds off at times I'm not blaming them at all. Considering how these people perform, sing, and dance these same songs 8 times a week with only one day of rest in between, all you can do is respect them as professionals to keep going. It's why I keep telling people, Broadway musical actors are the hardest working actors of all time. They don't get paid that much, yet they do so much in just a week to give the same quality performance to the crowds that come see them each time a week. So I'm cutting slack. This isn't some movie or TV Show where they can take breaks and or re-shoots. This is BROADWAY! Everything is in ONE-take all the way through with no take backs. All they can do as professionals is tell themselves they did their best and move on. So yeah, for these actors doing this 8 times a week, they sounded pretty damn good to me.<br/><br/>I guess the only thing that kinda bothered me with this was how a few shots were directed and edited. Specifically in the first act of the show. Some of the zoom in's were unnecessary at times, wide shots were funky at crucial parts of songs and angling. Specifically the camera that is facing the audience is strange at times. I mean, it worked well for songs like 'You'll be Back' as it showed King George strutting downstage, but for 'Right Hand Man' it was weird because George Washington was facing the camera directly as he was being introduced. Should've just kept the camera facing away from the crowd and onto the stage. In fact, that whole song was weirdly directed when I think about it now. The second act was directed and edited much better. But I'm no camera-man, so who am I to really criticize that? I appreciate the effort put into this whole thing and I still love it to the point where I wasn't too taken aback by it!<br/><br/>I am not sure if this pro-shot can be nominated for any awards, but if it did, I would be so happy if Leslie, Renee, Philippa, Daveed, or Christopher got awarded something because they all shone out like the stars the are this entire thing. Energy, charisma, emotion, and passion into every note they sung. I mean, I know these guys got a platoon of awards when this originally premiered back on their original run, but damn... They just deserve an award for this in my head. If any music gets nominated, Lin HAS to win because like many have said, his music is a work of genius!<br/><br/>Maybe this is just my theater nerd bias speaking, and maybe this might change the more I sit on it, but overall, this pro-shot gets a solid 9.1/10 for me! Time I will never get back. This is tied with Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy as one of two movies I wish I could have walked out of. Not a minute went by I didn't wish it was over. The only positive thing I can say about this is that it's impressive one man wrote the lyrics and music, then acted and sang in the lead role...Must have been an easy audition. I'm glad it's on Disney+ so I didn't waste money when it come to Australia. The performances are ok: a few actors were good fun. It's Broadway hip hop: interesting but not compelling. As I live in Australia to see Hamilton was a Dream, An expensive dream. This is ABSOULUTE PERFECTION. I FELT I WAS IN NEW YORK. Why does the left insist on trying to change history?<br/><br/>This is garbage I tried to get tickets for this when I was in NY and I was heartbroken that we couldn't get them so when I heard they were streaming it I was absolutely delighted!
I've watched pretty much every musical there is and I can tell you now this is spectacular! New, different, individual and beautifully written and performed I loved it.. and when the lock down lifts I'm prepared to watch it in every country in the world! Superb!! My new favorite musical. Unlike most musicals with one or two showstoppers and the rest being fillers that bore you to tears, Hamilton almost had no bad songs. The story of Hamilton and his compatriots was moving and inspirational. I watched it for the first time on July 4, 2020. In these dark times in the United States, the story of Hamilton feels especially important. Absolute torture to watch. highly inaccurate writing. Terrible music with a monotonous beat. Terrible raping that sound like loud spoken words. Terrible voices. i can go on on. Hours of hip-rap-hop to wrap the most trivial lyrics summarizing a badly studied history, if this is patriotism I'm am afraid that Samuel Johnso was right. Because if Disney hadn't shown it, I might've wasted real money on actual tickets. 3h+ of someone rapping unintelligibly to a background of people doing rubbish "yo" and "word" type hand movements, and pointless flips that I'm pretty sure no one in knickerbockers actually ever did. I like actual music in my musicals and I like to see stuff happening in a show. Got neither. Also, no character development, and perhaps it's cause I'm English, but I don't see what's interesting about the actual story. Was less plot and more "so what?" Lost interest and started playing on my phone as well; and every time I looked up, nothing at all seemed to have changed. And the race of some characters just confused things so I couldn't work out who anyone was meant to be (especially the wife's sister, so my husband had to explain to me). Seemed to be for the sake of it. Confusing, boring and loooooooong. If you're American, you'll probably whoop and holler and jump up clapping randomly like the audience did; if you're not, Fire Saga's got much catchier songs. Don't like hip hop. Still, I went into it open minded and was determined to give this show a chance. Made it to about 10 minutes. I've seen a good few musicals in my lifetime - this is the first I couldn't finish. Hands down the worst. Maybe its just not my thing, Great job!!! Standing ovation!! I hate musicals but this one was smart funny interesing and well-written!!! Great job!!!! I have watched the West End Production 3 times over the past few years and it's been a dream to see the original Broadway Cast in action. It did not disappoint. I laughed, cried and was in awe of the whole production. Lin-Manuel is a genius. The musical is fantastic and the casting perfect, but what really stands out to me is that Miranda wrote the ENTIRE thing. Story, music, and lyrics. An absolutely monumental achievement. This is a filmed recording of the hit musical Hamilton, a musical about first Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton featuring a predominantly Hispanic and African American cast and hip-hop music mixed with other styles. From what I understand, it mixes footage from a live performance and separately filmed close-ups. This is a wonderful show!<br/><br/>The story in this is an engrossing look at one man's life and death, his tremendous highs and lows. Besides being dramatic, the clever lines in this can also be pretty funny.<br/><br/>The songs in this are truly unique. This presentation shows why Hamilton is the biggest musical of the decade. It accomplishes something that appears to be rarer and rarer in recent decades: every song is a winner. This is especially impressive since this is a song-only musical with basically no spoken dialogue.<br/><br/>The one part of this show that could be an issue for some is that singing and exposition can go by pretty quickly, especially in the first fifteen minutes, and you could miss something.<br/><br/>The choreography and staging are also great, not to mention very creative at times. The dancing really accentuates the story and songs. The set rather than changing scenes takes the minimalist route of having one basic set and the use of body movement, props, and a couple other stage aspects in order to tell the story. It's all so complex and fascinating to watch.<br/><br/>The performances in this are top-notch all-around. I've heard and seen a lot of comments that Lin Manuel-Miranda (the lead and creator of this) isn't as strong a singer as the rest of the cast, however it's hard to imagine anyone else in the role. (Though by now, I'm sure plenty of people on stage have.) He just pulls off the man's drive so well in such a passionate manner. Going back to the show's sense of humor and unique interpretations, we are treated to a couple of delightfully flamboyant turns from Daveed Diggs and Johnathan Groff (from Frozen and Mindhunters).<br/><br/>The nice thing about this compared to seeing the show live on stage is that the close-up shots allow you to truly get a good look at the actors' expressions. (Though once in a while since the blocking is done in relation to talking in the direction of an audience, the actors can be facing the camera at an odd angle. It's not a big issue.)<br/><br/>Overall, I can not recommend this tremendous work enough. History can be boring for many but this changes things.. hope we get more like this. Yesterday, a bazillion folks tuned in to Disney+ to see the debut of "Hamilton"...a recording of the Broadway show back in 2016. Because it's not a traditional movie-style musical, it's pretty difficult to compare it to a typical film in the genre. It's also a film whose enjoyment definitely depends on your age. I am in my mid-50s....hardly the age to like hip-hop style music in a musical. But, despite this, I did respect what the show was trying to accomplish--to bring America history to the masses AND to make it more accessible to minorities as most of the parts were played by Black and Hispanic actors and actresses. So, while having the likes of George Washington and Aaron Burr played by black actors isn't historically accurate, it does help make history more inclusive....as did the very modern music. And, as an ex-history teacher, I am thrilled about these things even if I wasn't all that fond of the singing. Well worth seeing....and a nice chance to publicize a few nearly forgotten great Americans. Literally one of the worst things I have ever seen. This was the worst musical I have seen since La-La Land. To be fair we only watched almost 18 minutes (which was 4 more than La-La Land), but we were not compelled to continue. The story, the music, it just did not grab ahold of our attention. It didn't help having to watch the 'king' slobbering thru his solo. We truly love seeing musicals, but this one was overrated and a serious let-down. I've been a big fan of the soundtrack for years but have yet to get the chance to experience the show in person. However, this version was brilliantly directed and makes you feel like you're there. Fantastic performances all around and not only worth a watch but numerous rewatches as well. I saw a bootleg tons of times, I saw the show in London and I could sing along to the entire cast recording from beginning to end but this... this is everything we needed. The filming was beautiful, added so much character and added a completely new layer to the show. Lin, Pippa, Renee, Leslie and the rest of the cast could not have been better. Top notch performance. This is absolutely fantastic and that's saying a lot coming from me, I usually hate musicals I saw this show on Broadway about 2 and a half years ago. This film version of the play is just the right combination of close and distant shots, capturing the feel of theater and combining it with the intimacy of film. I have been attending Broadway for a bit over 50 years now and this show is certainly in my top three. The material is outstanding, dancing, singing, history lesson. I know a film can never totally capture the experience of seeing a show live, but I have to say, this one comes as close as I think anyone is ever going to get. Wow! What can I say?!?! The music was wonderful. The acting precise. Thank you Disney+ for streaming this for everyone to enjoy. It's basically perfect and any complaints would be nearly nitpicking technical aspects of a live broadway show. The story is fluid, the songs are catchy, the content is relevant and the adaptation to the screen is beautiful. Enjoy this work of art. Such a fun way to see this masterpiece!!! Will rewatch again and again. I've seen many Plays & Musicals and Hamilton will keep you amused while administering a history lesson. The mindless comments left by illiterate racist want people to believe a play that's received eminent prestige from every acclaimed critic, previous presidents and every possible award to the Pulitzer Prize isn't an exceptional noteworthy presentation! Let me just say screw all these reviewers who are complaining about people of color playing white people and as much attention as this play got why are you just now realizing this?<br/><br/>I love musicals. I've seen Wizard of Oz, Little Shop of Horrors, Fiddler on the Roof and The Sound of Music in theatres so I was excited to see this especially since it was insanely popular but EVERYTHING is song, even dialogue, I can't follow it. I feel like my brain doesn't process the words in songs as quickly or something but I just could not keep up so I gave up after 15 minutes. I can't imagine listening to 2 hours and 40 minutes of straight singing. Some may love it and that's cool, I like that they are doing something historical because really how many Americans know the story of Hamilton. This is the first time I've ever written a review on here but Hamilton deserves it.
It's my favorite musical and I was lucky enough to watch it live on Broadway in october 2018 and it was absolutely amazing but now thanks to this I had the chance to watch it with the INCREDIBLE original cast.
I love how it's just a recording of the show. Best way to captivate what it's like to be in the room where it happens! Where I can understand why people love this musical, it didn't really hit the right spot for me. Maybe it is because I'm not huge into rap music, but I can't give this one to high of a review for myself. So I couldn't go see Hamilton in the theatre because of the lockdown and don't know when I will be able to. But this turned up on Disney+ and my head is still spinning by how incredible this production is. Lin-Manuel Miranda is a genius to have written this. Every performance in this story is flawless, engaging and emotive. The big moments are heart stopping and the intimate ones are heart breaking.<br/><br/>My 8 year old son, who was engrossed in his Switch, stopped playing his video game and couldn't take his eyes of the screen within the first moments of "Alexander Hamilton". He said the songs were amazing.<br/><br/>Hamilton lives up to all the hype and hyperbole, and then some. The best show I have watched since Les Miserables. After seeing the show live on two occasions I could not wait for the Disney+ addition with the original cast, the thing that struck me is that in your living room on the TV you appreciate the characters so much more than you do live, as you get to absorb their emotions throughout and see their expressions in detail. The live show provides you with a lot more in terms of viewing, as the cast are constantly performing during the set which you don't get to see on Disney+ version (Camera focus on main characters within scene). I have to admit, when I was 1st introduced to Ham, I was not sure but I am now true fan. I recommend you listen to the soundtrack and then watch the performance, well done Lin & Co, you have captured many of us. May up it to 10 after I watch it a few more times ðŸ˜œ. I didnt care for this. Its not great. It's less than just ok. I feel like my time was wasted. Glad I didn't pay for it. Also I'm a person of color so this has nothing to do with the race of the people cast. I just didn't like it Would give negative stars if possible.<br/><br/>Do not believe the hype<br/><br/>In was almost physically painful to watch this disaster. You have been warned. It's been said that nothing kills the experience of live theatre like filming it; indeed many of Andrew Lloyd Webber's filmed stage productions can be held up as testament to this. Lin Manuel Miranda's Hamilton however bucks that trend. Filmed over three nights with additional close ups filmed without an audience, this feels like perfect blend of movie and stage performance.
Based on Ron Chernow's biography of Alexander Hamilton, you don't have to be a history buff to enjoy the story. Hamilton is an idealist who was also his own worst enemy, yet despite this, his ideals helped shape the United States of America. The music tells his story and the performances sparkle.
When you look at the cost of great seats to see this live, coupled with the knowledge that you're unlikely to ever see the original cast again, this alone is worth an annual subscription to Disney +.
It's powerful, fun, entertaining, thought provoking and moving all at the same time. Essential viewing. Probably one of my all-time favorite movies of 2020 and might just be the BEST movie based on a broadway show. We NEED more movies like this and people should learn from the people who made this movie how to properly adapt something from broadway instead of turn it into a living nightmare like Cats. If you have Disney+, literally go and check this one out! To watch this through the lens of today, is just what is needed to "bind up the wounds of a nation" if only for a moment. A reminder of the patriotism that built our nation. A reminder that patriotism is a feeling that should call us to action. Patriotism is more than parades, fireworks and barbecues. Patriotism is sacrifice. What we are asked to do today for our nation (wear a mask, social distance) pales in comparison to what our forefathers & foremothers sacrificed. Will we rise up and act on the example of so many before us? Thank you for the timeless message and example of Hamilton, Washington and Jefferson within this magnificent musical. I'll just cut to the chase, the filmed version of the mega-hit stage musical HAMILTON (now streaming on Disney+) is terrific. If you are one of the few that have not seen this, check it out - you'll be glad you did.<br/><br/>I could go on and on about the Pulitzer-Prize winning show, the script, the music, the performances and/or the cross-cultural casting - all of which works to perfection, but what separates this film from the other hit Broadway shows that are converted to film is how well that the filmmakers were able to translate the power of being inside the theater during a live performance of this show.<br/><br/>Credit, of course, needs to go to the visionaries responsible for this show, creator/writer/star Lin-Manuel Miranda and Director Thomas Kail. They realized pretty early on (when the show was becoming the phenomenon that it has become) that they wanted to preserve this event for future generations, so started making plans to film the show - in High Def - with an audience and without an audience (for close-ups). In June 2016, about a month before the original cast started leaving the show (and right after the show won 11 Tony Awards), they spent $10 million to capture the show - with live audiences on Sunday and Tuesday and then spent the rest of Sunday night and all day Monday doing close-ups and crane shots to augment the action.<br/><br/>The results are outstanding. The wide-shots show the breadth of the production - showing the strong, Tony Award winning choreography by Andy Blankenbuehler, the unique, minimal and highly versatile set, the Tony Award winning costumes by Paul Tazewell and the Lighting Design that earned Howell Blinkley a Tony. All of these are showcased in this film - special note should be made about the Lighting that needed to be tweaked on the spot for the filming.<br/><br/>As for the close-ups, they showcase the wry smile and comedic delight that Tony winner Daveed Diggs shows in his roles as Lafayette/Jefferson, the power and sorrow of Tony Award winner Renee Elise Goldsberry - her spotlight number SATISFIED is as "perfect" a musical number as you will ever see. The powerful acting of Leslie Odom, Jr. as Aaron Burr (who won the Tony as Best Actor over Lin-Manuel's performance as Hamilton) as well as terrific supporting turns by the likes of Anthony Ramos (Lawrence/Phillip), Chris Jackson (showing real leadership as George Washington) and Okieriete Onaodwoan as Hercules Mulligan (one of my absolute favorite characters in this show)./James Madison.<br/><br/>Special note should be made to Jonathan Groff's portrayal of King George III - it is, basically, a cameo role, but he is filmed with such tight close-ups (showing spittle rolling down has chin as he sings) that marvelously juxtaposes King George's real emotions with that of the words he is speaking.<br/><br/>But, of course, the real star is Lin-Manuel Miranda - the genius creative force behind Hamilton. Interestingly enough, I thought his performance was the weakest of the lead cast (don't get me wrong, he was still excellent - just not "as excellent" as some of the others). His true vision, of course, was to tell the story of "the people of that era" as told by "the people of our era".<br/><br/>That is the true genius of Hamilton.<br/><br/>Letter Grade: A+<br/><br/>10 stars out of 10 (can I turn this up to 11)? Literally so freakin good. The songs were so good, I've been singing to them for a few years but seeing it on the stage (on my tv) brought it all together. <3 Beautiful. Rally beautiful. Just a great musical and journey. Lucky enough to have seen Hamilton three times in the West End- but what a complete joy that we have been given the chance to see the original cast.<br/><br/>Daveed Diggs steals it...just... for me, but there are so many exemplary performances in here. Christopher Jackson's voice is just pure velvet; Philips Soo just wow; and Renee seems to also steal the scene in particular when she's there. Not only an awesome voice but amazing acting - as is everyone.<br/><br/>This is a rollercoaster ride of emotions anyway - even more poignant when theatres are closed (although sorry Groff - you can see why with all that spit- I realise he's mad King George though!)<br/><br/>THANK YOU Lin Manuel Miranda for your absolute literary/musical genius; and thank you Disney for releasing it early to the world and bringing some light back into the world at a dark time. I thought after all I've heard and read about this musical phenomenon that
July 4th would be an appropriate evening to judge for myself and I'm so pleased to say all the hype about Hamilton is true it is truly a fabulous stage show.
I could have seen Hamilton on our last trip to New York but two things put me off it's very expensive ticket cost and the gamble that I may not like it . Also I thought it would be an all wrap music show which is not my favourite musical genre but pleased to report the wrap lyrics are very clever and there are many other musical styles in this 2 hour 40 biographical musical.
Since then I've become a huge fan and admirer of Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda the new wunderkind of Broadway and Cinema .
Miranda has said that Hamilton reminded him of rapper Tupac Shakur, which is how he came up with the idea for a diverse hip hop musical about Hamilton's life. Miranda worked on "Hamilton"- a project that people, including his mentor Stephen Sondheim, told him would never work.
Lin -Manuel Miranda based Hamilton the musical on an unlikely source: a dense, 818-page biography of Alexander Hamilton by the historian Ron Chernow many of his lyrics to the show are actually based directly on speeches from the book.
His first musical "In the Heights " had an Australian Premier and I saw it at the Sydney Opera House in 2019 and loved it as it reminded me of West Side Story. It also has a wrap hip hop score butlike Hamilton features other forms of theatre music like reggae traditional ballads and great orchestrations . Lin -Manuel has recently filmed "In the Heights " as a full feature movie to be released in 2021 and word on the street is it's a winner.
This version of Hamilton is a filmed version of the original multi eleven Tony Award winning musical directed by Thomas Kail the staging looks simple but it's a very complex and effective series of moveable multi tiered timber scaffolds that frame the stage for the large cast allowing plenty of space for the action and choreography to take place.
Whenever I see credits mentioning the same person has composed , written and is starring as well as an executive producer in their own show which is very rare I think they're either a genius, or just a complete egomaniac. In the case of Hamilton Lin- Manuel Miranda is a genius in every category and his masterwork Hamilton truly deserved the 11Tony Awards it won in 2016 just one short of the record breaking 12 Tonys for Mel Brooke's musical The Producers.
Hamilton was filmed across three days in 2016, a few weeks before the original cast finished their contracts.
The musical's original director, Thomas Kail, assembled a crack team of filmmakers, put them in front of the stage and lovingly captured the story the way it was intended to be: as a piece of theatre.
Nine cameras recorded two full performances before live audiences. Between shows, the makers refilmed the production to allow for angles that would be impossible for audiences to see within the theatre including close-ups of intimate and dramatic moments and sweeping overhead shots that capture the entire stage.
Hamilton the musical is set in the not so United States of America of 1776 to 1800 and there are definite comparisons to the Political situation in that country today.
The musical has been receiving rave critical reviews and sold out tickets to all productions in and outside the United States it broke box office records in London and Broadway is set to do the same in Sydney next year.
"Hamilton" is the story of America then, told by America now. It features a score that blends hip-hop, jazz, R&B and Broadway, "Hamilton" has taken the story of American founding father Alexander Hamilton and created a revolutionary moment in theatre-a musical that has had a profound impact on culture, politics, and education.
It's no wonder John Bolton titled his recent book on President Donald Trump "The Room Where it Happened " the great song from Act 2 of " Hamilton " is titled The Room Where it Happens and takes place when Alexander Hamilton Americas first Secretary to the Treasury is ushered to a Secret Meeting where President Thomas Jefferson and his friend and future President James Maddison agree on an unprecedented compromise to move the Capital city of the new nation to their Southern electorate without consulting the American People or Aaron Burr who was the 3rd Vice President of the U.S.A.
The opening number "Alexander Hamilton "sets the show off beautifully sung by Lin-Manuel Miranda and the cast then leads to another great action song "My Shot." and a good example of the clever lyrics "I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
The whole cast in this original Broadway Production are superb of course Lin -Manuel is wonderful as Alexander Hamilton but this is an ensemble piece .
The two Schuyler sisters Angelica Renee Louise Goldsberry and Eliza Phillipa Soo who becomes Eliza Hamilton Alexander's wife sing beautifully and look beautiful in their roles and costumes as does the whole cast by costume designer Paul Tazewell .
Some of the most sublime and more emotional moments of Hamilton feature these two talented women especially their first song in Act 1 titled The Schuyler Sisters.
The other major male roles Leslie Odam Jnr as Aaron Burr and Daveed Diggs as Marquis de Lafayette add to the drama and comedy of Hamilton and it's hard to imagine a better cast. Other great supporting roles that add so much to Hamilton are Chris Jackson as George Washington and a star turn by Jonathan Groff as King George 111 who has a great song and dance number " You'll Be Back "referring to America's separation from England.
I've often read that the American musical theatre has over the last one hundred years had 3 pivotal evolutions that have forever influenced the genre forever Jerome Kern's 1927 Showboat which for the first time progressed a dramatic story with a musical score that changed the art of musicals from comedy reviews or light weight romantic librettos .Then the next great change came in 1943 with Rodgers and Hammerstein's groundbreaking musical "Oklahoma " which was the first musical that raised the curtain on the solo character Curly singing "Oh What a Beautiful Morning " and developing from the earlier Show Boat, epitomising the development of the "book musical", a musical play where the songs and dances are fully integrated into a well-made story with serious dramatic goals that are able to evoke genuine emotions.
Then in 1957 "West Side Story" with the music of Leonard Bernstein and the spectacular Broadway debut Of Stephen Sondheim as lyricist bought gang warfare and a revolutionary contemporary song and instrumentally inventive orchestrations that have become classical milestones of many orchestra and Opera Houses the world . We will see a new film version next year directed by Stephen Spielberg.
Hamilton I predict will join these 3 famous musicals in history as a revolutionary and innovative game changer that will help keep the Broadway musical alive and thriving.
Is it worth $8.99 a month or $89.99 a year a Disney channel subscription? you'll have to judge that but it's the best seat in the house for a fraction of the cost of a ticket for Hamilton the musical. . I've noticed some great High School professional productions of various musicals and other movies and animated features on Disney so it's a yes for me and I'm not on commission .
I've added to my Christmas wish list a ticket to the Australian production of this great musical in Sydney next year at the Lyric Theatre.
Composers that have the talent to star in their own musicals are less than a dozen and Lin - Manuel has written and starred in two Washington Heights and Hamilton.
Disney Plus Channel paid $75 million for the screening rights for Hamilton and the franchise rights which will create huge dividends for Disney now and into the future.
Lin -Manuel reportedly made $ 6.4 million off Hamilton in 2017 alone before this Disney deal. He is a modest multi millionaires owning two luxury pre-war apartments in Upper Manhattan, but otherwise lives a relatively modest lifestyle and still rides the subway. The latest estimate of his net wealth after the Disney deal is $80 million .
Broadway made Lin-Manuel Miranda a star, but philanthropy-from disaster relief in Puerto Rico to arts education at home in New York-is truly the family business.
This filmed production of a stage musical is definitely the best I've ever seen and I really can't wait to see what our Australian production is like next year. The story is fantastic. It's nice seeing history brought to life. It is a little long and boring for my taste. Tried watching this 3 times the long 4th of July weekend and fell asleep each time. I understand it is a blockbuster but I found it some what boring. Honestly, I ended up watching a rerun of a James Bond movie by Sunday night. First off i am really glad that they deiced to make this available as a movie. It can be frustrating when there is a show/musical that you want to see and you just can't get to it and this gives a ticket to everyone and i think this is great.<br/><br/>I have wanted to see this musical for a while as i knew some of the songs and i wasn't disappointed for the most part.<br/><br/>Some of the songs are really great and i can understand how they had made their way to me even though i hadn't watched the show.<br/><br/>I will unfortunately say that the mix is god awful. Some of the singing is just noise and this is not the fault of the singers it is the fault of the mixers. I was really trying to understand what was going on at the start and the only words i could make out where 'Alexander Hamilton' it is a real shame as this happens again. It does seem to get slightly better as the movie progresses but at the start it was inaudible in parts and i was so disappointed because the singers were great.<br/><br/>Speaking of the Sisters were the best part for me. They were all fantastic singers and i loved all their songs. I would have appreciated even more of them, they did a great job.<br/><br/>Another issue i had was the storytelling, like i said i have never seen the show so i didn't know what to expect. In England this story is not told at all. I know vaguely of these people due to watching American Media but it just isn't told in schools. So i had no idea what was going on at the start so i was trying to find my bearings but then i realised it was "And then this happened" storytelling, there wasn't a head to follow it was almost like vignettes of Hamiltons life, not that this is a bad thing i just found it harder to follow at first and knowing nothing about this it kinda confused me, this probably wouldn't be an issue if you already have an idea what is going on.<br/><br/>The choreography is great and so are the costumes.<br/><br/>I would give it a watch if you have Disney+, keep in mind it is very long as well but i would say for the most part it is work it. Watched it with family. Everyone loved it.<br/><br/>Music was great, soundtrack has been on in the car ever since. Lin-Miranda Manuel is a genius in our lifetime. The lyrics are so intelligent. The camera work is perfect. The choreography is masterfully artistic. And the talent... through the roof. I cannot say enough good things. I waited all this time to actually see the musical and it was worth every moment. I love musicals and there's nothing better than seeing a live show, but it's not the same watching a recording, unless it's like Chicago or the Greatest Showman. Hamilton is a recorded live performance and the music, acting, choreography is first class. This is a very slick, tightly produced show. However after half an hour I just lost interest. My family gave up after ten minutes saying it was boring, and they usually rewatch musicals multiple times. I'm sure it would be different live on Broadway but on TV it's harder to follow what's happening and hence a little boring. With all the hype, I assumed this musical had to be overrated. Full disclosure - I'm generally not a fan of hip hop. This musical is not overrated. I found the show unwatchable. Not what I expected and lost interest in about 15 minutes. I would not recommend to anyone. A complete waste of time and money. Music was disgusting trash, acting is pathetic. "Storyline"/script is a shameful, offense to the memory and legacy of an icon of American History.
Actors and production crew should be ashamed and embarrassed for themselves. Disney should be as well for exposing children to such trash. This isn't a musical. It's an opera. I was drawn in from the first song and they kept my interest for over 2 1/2 hours. Tad but of history, great music, and amazing performance! Sorry but not me favorite musical. Some parts are boring and some lyrics can be understand because the rap. Rap is not singing music, Just people cant sing and smooch the lyrics talking fast. Its a great production but not for my taste. Just watch it once and put it to rest not to watching more of one time. Phillipa Soo KILLS IT!!!
OMG this is so good, this musical is amazing.
This is the first time watching the musical for me and I have to say: this is the best musical I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Maybe you're wondering why I gave it an eight then, and to that I will just say that this is a review of the Disney+ version, and there are way too many different shots for a musical: when I see a musical in a theatre I view it from one point (my seat). This experience has zooms, and when you use film techniques on a theater show it loses a lot of its charm..<br/><br/>But the show itself, ooh boy. It definitely is an experience. I cried so theres that, it takes a lot to make me cry bc I (usually) see straight through the parts where it's very made, but if it leads up to a moment and the singers kill it, that deserves respect. One of the greatest historical musicals ever made, the story, the outfits, the set, the score, the casting - everything absolutely perfect! Songs are incredible. Lin Manuel Miranda is remarkable in this, a living legend. You won't forget a musical like this. That isnt a Musical. Cant recommend it. Dont watch it, if you Love Musicals with nice Music and Not just Rap shid! I don't usually get this into musicals but I've already watched this 3 times since it came out yesterday. The talent of the entire cast is amazing! I have been waiting a long long time to see this! Definitely not a let down! One of the bests musical I've ever seen! The perfect way to record a musical! This filmed stage production was nothing short of emotional, dramatic, and hilarious. I couldn't help but to give it 10/10. It isn't factual but what story about a persons life is anymore unless it's a written biography. Never been a fan of musicals nor had any desire to see a Broadway play. Think that may have changed after watching Hamilton today.<br/><br/>Genius, from beginning to end!!! Well done, Lin-Manuel Miranda and cast.
👏👏👏 I listened to the soundtrack millions of times and was still sooooooo excited to watch it. Truly amazing and breathtaking. Some people are saying that they didn't it like it because it was historically accurate(it was partly):Tell me you've a seen remake of a movie to another that hasn't changed a few things. People didn't like it because they don't like musicals: Then why did you watch a musical? People don't like it because people of color were playing people who were white:Lin-Manuel Miranda said it's the story of America then told by America now. People said they didn't like it because it was overrated: Ok, I guess I get it. People didn't it like because it was hip hop:It's literally a hip hop/rap musical. You hate the musical because you don't like hip hop.<br/><br/>My opinion: Truly a breathtaking amazing wonderful masterpiece. The actors are amazing, vocals are amazing, costumes are A+, music is wow, camerawork is mediocre, and will watch it for years to come. Enjoy. Well filmed and lots of energy. That's about all the good I can say... I could seldom follow what they were singing. Incredibly self indulgent, overly woke to the point of self caricature. If I paid for a ticket I'd be angry at myself. I respect those who liked this, but I can't bring myself to pay attention. Why is this ok to have black actors play historically white people...... Remember HS history class, how boring it was? Now imagine that as a musical VERY LOOSLY based on facts with a few twists thrown in and you have this stink fest. I have had several friends see it in person with the same review. If you are a raging San Francisco, die-hard blue maybe this would be interesting. For the vast majority of us, snooze fest. Skip this unless you get college credit for the pain. Maybe it's that I've seen some absolutely spectacular theater (the original casts of Rent, Miss Siagon, and Les Misérables), that I found this over hyped.<br/><br/>Sure, the gimmick casting certainly matches the music and the performers are certainly capable. Plus it's great to see such a diverse cast.<br/><br/>However, I was just never drawn into the story to any meaningful extent and after it was over, it quickly faded.<br/><br/>Maybe the live performance is better? Or maybe this emperor actually has no clothes. "Movie" made by idiot for the idiots.. I can't believe someone payed to see this garbage! This movie is HIGHLY overrated, my main problem is the fact that it's just a copy/paste from the stage, rather than a new adaptation of the show. It comes across as very lazy, which isn't surprising coming from Disney. The music is okay, it definitely does not beat Wicked, West Side Story or The Lion King's soundtracks. The story is good but like I said earlier, it's very much affected to me that it's just a copy-paste movie. Needless to say, I was very disappointed, this isn't an adaptation, you might as well see it on Broadway rather than waste a Disney+ subscription, so uncreative. Really hope the new Wicked movie coming out in 2021 or 22 isn't this lazy. Absolutely perfect. Pure enjoyment! Music is amazing. There's nothing bad to say about this. The direction it took was beautiful. The acting was phenomenal. A standout Leslie Odom Jr. performance. All done on one stage production. The songs and music were perfect. Lin Manuel-Miranda outdid himself. I'm glad it came to Disney plus. I know nothing about American history but I have been searching up these historical characters to find out more. I feel sorry for Hamilton in the end I wonder what more he could of done had burr not killed him.<br/><br/>Each actor brings out the characters so well you always know who there playing. I loved the actor playing George Washington he has such an amazing voice! And....I've watched this twice!! First without subtitles, 2nd with subtitles....lyrics were beautiful sung and clever, choreography and motions were artistically stellar....a work of art watched on tv! Next best thing to live! I see why now many have bought the album.....new timeless treasure! Singing and hip hop...not sure those who are not fans would be open to listen to the spoken words but, truly listen as poetic verses...writing is awesome! ALL the feels ! Daveed Diggs, Leslie Odom Jr, Jonathan Groff and Renée Goldsberry give exceptional performances. Oscar worthy. How incredible to be able to see this show on TV instead of going to New York and spending $800.<br/><br/>After watching it, I wished I had seen it live. A production came to my home town and the last row in the balcony was the aforementioned $800.<br/><br/>Anyway, this is a fantastic and memorable show, all the more important for maybe getting a few kids interested in a) historical characters; and b) Broadway/musical theater.<br/><br/>The music is not my demographic, but there are many different styles, and I loved some of the songs. The lyrics were clever. I think Lin-Manuel Miranda is a genius.<br/><br/>What I love is the originality, the expansiveness, the singing, the choreography, but most of all the incredible energy of the cast and story.<br/><br/>For people who have no interest in seeing our forefathers dancing and singing, I say, watch it anyway. I wasn't interested either. It is fabulous. Broadway is a very exclusive place. There, acclaimed and historic plays are interpreted for some weeks and, most of the times, stay there. Rarely, they are filmed and distributed or interpreted to other publics. Hamilton came to change this, selling not the same experience of watching in the theater, but a very similar one. In the first minute, I was hypnotized. Since then, I didn't take my eyes from the screen. Is a charming film with two acts, one better than the other. The twist of the play is on the songs from GENIUS Lin Manuel Miranda, who wrote the lyrics and composed the melody. The score is a delicious blend of Hip-Hop, R&B and Jazz. Not happy with telling a story and creating songs that have a connection with which other, Miranda added a precise humor in the lyrics, in the right moments, that made me laugh a lot. Besides that, which is too much already, I will summarise other achievements: the costumes are out of this world; the lighting is accurate; the set, although simple and relatively small, is used with intelligence and creativity; the choreographies are fluid; is well filmed, capturing all the emotion and action; directed with a smart eye and performed by a great cast, flexible and competent. After using every adjective that I know, what I can say about Hamilton is that it is a valuable production. You can be sure that this movie is the start of a new trend in the cinema industry. Is a reason to congratulate the ones involved. A Broadway hit which became a pop icon and modern legend can finally be enjoyed from home! It does not disappoint for a second. The set pieces, choreography, lighting, editing, camerawork are just flawless and combined with the unforgettable songs and performances of the original cast they form an incredible viewing experience, transporting you into the heart of Broadway. A must see for all musical, theater and hip hop fans. I could watch this eight more times before running out of hands. Just finished watching Hamilton about ten minutes ago. Now I understand what all the hype was about. This is one of those rare times in the 21st century: BELIEVE THE HYPE! Perfect musical about American History that we all need to know!!!! Give it a chance and you won't regret it!! Excellent production and filming!
This is how it should be done and after listening to the music almost 100 times it is just perfect to watch it again and again! This could possibly be the best play in history, but because of the hip-hoppity sing-song of everything, I had to turn it off just 5 minutes in. I really wanted to love it, but just couldn't. ðŸ˜” A common critique of Hamilton has been that it's a disgraceful attempt to rewrite our history and romanticize our founding fathers as many of them were slaveowners. This article seeks to address this critique. Did Disney release this movie ahead of its original release date to address the divides in our country? Could Miranda actually be illustrating that America and our country is an unfinished symphony? There aren't many things I've ever rated a 10 on IMDB, but this is an exception. It is truly perfect. It is such a privilege to see the original cast perform this, something I never thought I'd be able to see, and to be able to rewatch at any time. The cast is phenomenal, Diggs, Soo and Groff especially. It makes capturing a complex stage musical look simple when it's anything but - I've never seen a filmed staging done so well, it genuinely captures the feel of attending a live performance but supplemented with just the right amount of close ups and aerial shots. I hope the success of this will encourage the filming of more shows in a similar way, as someone who's unlikely to get back to Broadway any time soon! I will be encouraging everyone I know to watch it. Spotify will tell you that I've listened to the OST for Hamilton over 100 times. Like so many others it drew me in and wowed me with its catchy, clever and poignant lyrics and I was desperate to see the stage show. An incredible friend bought me tickets to go this year but due to covid it got cancelled, I along with thousands of others were devastated by this.
When I heard Disney were releasing this version it was like wedybeen given a second chance, not only to see the show, but the original cast! I've never been one to queue or refresh pages to get something first but at 8am UK time I was hitting play as soon as it appeared.<br/><br/>And wow, what a show. I laughed, I cried, I want to watch it again and show everyone I know already.<br/><br/>The songs I was already so familiar with felt new and exciting as each performance was so expertly choreographed to tell the story. With not much more than a single revolving stage piece I felt the action tangibly, Hurricane and The World Was Wide Enough were breathtaking.<br/><br/>I know this phenomenon already has a huge fan base who will be watching this over the next few days but it's amazing that so many people who may not have had the opportunity to watch will now be able to. For me, it was just OK. Since I'm not an American, I wasn't very invested into this musical. And I'm using "musical" very lightly here.<br/><br/>I will say that I believe that this is the author's vision of the history so I'll not go into the historical accuracy of this work.<br/><br/>In my opinion the main cast was good and maybe the weakest link was Lin-Manuel Miranda (the author). The songs were not interesting for me. The first half was alright, but the second half was boring. Good god what a load of toss. Cringeworthy of the finest, hip-hop it is not, choreography from a 1980's TV show, spoon fed history albeit not even close to factual. Over two and a half hours of self back slapping twaddle, for the critics to scared to say it's crap and the woke culture who just want to agree with other's extrinsic aspirations. Most boring storyline I ever had the privilege to fall asleep to! Why?! Why has "Hamilton" become everyone's love child?? Social media has rotted the brain and pop culture is dead to me. Don't get me wrong!! The talent cast in this show is amazing, incredible, awesome, kudos all around- But the set, costume, and storyline- ugh - did not keep my eyes open, and!! unless I pop an Adderal, I ain't getting through the second act!! On the contrary, the biography, "Alexander Hamilton," written by renowned historian Ron Crenshaw, once read by and inspired Lin Manuel Miranda to write and act in this broadway production, is now in my Kindle to read. Both Crenshaw & Miranda won a Pulitzer Prize for their adaptation of Alexander Hamilton's life. However, unless you were really studious in American History, this show will go over your head. Especially if you are only an American public high school graduate. (Cause your government failed you, and you is dumb, PUT ON A MASK!) If you are attempting to watch this broadway show (that is filmed on stage with a live studio audience), do yourself a favor and read the Wikipedia breakdown of the show-unless you want to challenge your American civics course teacher and their public school salary. (Hint- they don't get paid enough to care if you can retain the Federalist papers or even recall a single Founding Father's name... I think they are more worried about affording rent for the month.)<br/><br/>Judgy Joey Because I couldnt stop laughing the entire time. like for reals.. and whats with the non-diversity on display here? 9.2 stars is hilarious! child please. Yawn! It's a musical, musicals are annoying. I dont get all the hype.... nor did I really hear about any hype. When are we getting the marvel series going Disney? You guys haven't released anything "new" in way too long. Wish I only stuck with the month free trial.... ðŸ˜ª I came watching this with low expectations, buuuuuuut they all got blown away with how amazing this was!!! I didn't want it to end! The images, the music, the performances, the set, the lighting, the choreography the writing....all breathtaking and thought-provoking. The range of emotions the viewer experiences is exceptional. Bravo to all involved! Watch the extras, as it is fascinating to see how it came together, and the insights of the cast, writer, and director. Well worth the extra 33 minutes. History's eyes are on us all. I live in Iran and I've been dying to watch Hamilton since its Broadway premiere back in 2015. I fell in love with a show that I couldn't have the opportunity to watch. But Tonight, after being able to witness this masterpiece I realized It is even far more sensational than I have ever imagined.
I have so many things to say but to save you some time I summarize it in few words:
"Pure definition of art" I have never been a fan of modern musical productions but got hooked on this one. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Bringing history to life with modern hip hop. It is not terrible like other reviewers said. I give 4 for being unique and novel as a concept for Broadway show. Another 2 stars for actors and singers.Also, i am ok with it not being historically accurate. After all, it is entertainment, not course in American history.
However, it was too long, not engaging enough through whole 3 hours, and a bit confusing story line. The decorations could be much better.
I would suggest to see it live in theaters when possible, otherwise it is a bit dull asw a movie. As a huge fan of the soundtrack, this was such an amazing experience as it is truly an unprecedented capture. Without having seen the show before you don't realize how much Groff and Ramos steal the show, as they added the most contextual yet non-singing moments. It really puts into perspective how much of a phenomenon it really is. 10 out of 10, would watch again, I hope they release it on digital and DVD at some point. The quick shifting between the camera angles every few seconds makes it hard to focus and practically impossible to actually watch and know what's going on. The audio is terrible! TERRIBLE! I can't even understand some of the cast when they are talking/singing. I recommend skipping this movie and buying the soundtrack instead. This movie seriously makes me think that I never want to see any future play in real life or on screen. So, just save yourself the trouble and avoid this movie. Miranda is a genius! 46.5 BANGERS!! not a single bad song! Ah I'm sorry... I don't think this project deserves a 5. It is clearly a brilliant work of broadway... the amount of work and dedication that goes into a project like this blows my mind. Like seriously, the writing is brilliant, all the performers KILL it, and it's all great American History.
My problem is that I just don't love the music... it's a a musical, and for me to rate it high I would have to love the music. It isn't music that I could listen to. I liked probably a fourth of the music. Also, when your medium for telling a story is SOLELY music, it is THE MOST IMPORTANT THING to be able to understand the words, but many of the raps are nearly impossible to follow along with because they talk to so fast. This being said, some parts (mostly the beginning) were very hard to follow along with.
Great rapping though.
This just wasn't really my thing, if I saw it on stage I may feel differently towards it but... just not feeling it. Sorry.
But this is my dads second time seeing it... and he felt this way the first time and loved it the second time. So i may revisit in a few years. While the acting, story. and music is as spectacular as the hype and Tony awards indicate, there are just too many parts in the show where the orchestra does not balance the voice, most especially in the chorus parts. If you've listened to the album enough times and know the words as I have done, obviously this is not an issue. But when I watched with friends, two of them who had never seen the show, each independently told me that they could not understand all of the music being spoken. Solos, duets, no issue on that at all and they both loved those parts as much as they should. Sorry I had to turn it off after 10 minutes and I like hip hop, theatre and musicals but this did nothing for me, maybe its because i'm from the UK but i just dont get the appeal. I'm not a fan of rap, but the few times Hamilton needs to actually sing were excruciating, Manuel's arrogance clearly cost the silver version. I'd like to say I hope this encourages a younger crowd to read some history, I just wish this wasn't incredibly aloof to the actual history, or that you could understand a lot of the rap rambling. If you like Broadway Musicals you will love this. If you are a history buff you will be angry or confused why they did a Hollywood switcheroo on the characters. Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, and Aaron Burr are not white! Lol. Once you get past "white face" you'll find it's really a story of Hamilton, his triumphs and mistakes, and redemption. Basically don't lose yourself while trying to reach your goals in life. A lot of folks want to make this a political play. It's not. It's about finding yourself and being a good person. Asking forgiveness for your mistakes. All other reviews are so ugh! To some, "Hamilton" is arguably first and foremost a page in American history. Unlike George Washington, names such as Alexander Hamilton, Aaron Burr and Thomas Jefferson may not be household names. But they still register. However, the subject matter, while fruit for thought for the "thinking audience", may not have the same appeal as, for instance, a convict constantly on the run during the most troubled times in recent French history.<br/><br/>As a musical, "Hamilton" is perfect in the sense of what a true musical should be: the songs are there to move the plotline forward and tell the story. Very often, the term "musical" is applied too loosely, to a stage play that happens to have a few songs inserted into it. Not so "Hamilton". Examples are abundant, in fact populate the entire musical. "Room where it happens", in addition to its melodic achievement, depicts the political intrigue better than a few pages of dialogue can. While it does not have the un-matched sophistication and wit of Lerner and Loewe, it demonstrates that simple lyrics can be just effective in doing the job. "Reynolds pamphlet", another example, is equally brilliant, in depicting a plotline layered intimate passion and emotion.<br/><br/>As a musical, "Hamilton" is bursting with energy and rhythm. Its music is vastly rich, including even barber-shop-ish quartets and "Three-little-maids"-ish trios. Quite a few numbers sound like a hybrid of G&S patter songs and Eminem rap. Filmed in front of a live audience at the Richard Rogers Theatre, "Hamilton" is unlike any other video recording of a live stage production. The close-ups put you at front row centre, or maybe even better, to experience the depth of emotion in the faces of the actors. The deft camera movement gives you a cinematic experience that you would not have expected.<br/><br/>The success of "Hamilton" as a live musical is announced loud and clear by the record-breaking 16 Tony nominations and 11 wins. As a movie, it remains to be seen. While not winning in acting, Lin-Manuel Miranda is the spirit of the show. The multi-cultural cast is absolutely brilliant. One particularly mention I have to make is Chris Jackson who plays George Washington, bringing the house down with his powerful singing. My affection for this actor comes from watching him in 87 episodes of "Bull", playing the most likeable character in that wonderful TV series. Nearly flawless execution. Incredible performance, beautiful camera work, the quality of the material speaks for itself.<br/><br/>However, D+ lost a star for censorship, which is just a shame any time it happens to art. If they weren't comfortable with the language of the performance, they should have put it up on Hulu.<br/><br/>All that said, it's still a majorly incredible performance. Would recommend to literally anyone. Does nobody find it incongruous that people of color are singing and dancing for liberty and equality in 1776? Yes, it is very well written. Yes, it is very well staged. Yes, it is very well performed. But all those things only make the bourgeois nature of it even worse. Those performers on stage would not be singing and dancing in 1776.<br/><br/>Sorry. Let's just ignore the genocide, the ethnic cleansing, the chattel slavery of people of color in the time period being celebrated. Let's all just pretend like talented people of color today can ignore the truth and cash in, and it is all good. Close your eyes if you can. While the performers are getting paid, who is making the real money? I almost made it 15 minutes in till I could stand no more. I have never forgiven Hip Hop for destroying black music in America. R&B was the 'musical score' of my youth and taught me about love, life, loss, everything. This is a two hour throbbing headache pretending to be 'music' and with an agenda which it never quite makes clear but is reminscient of Damon Wayans doing Oswald Bates. First of all why making 2 main characters...minority.. Now I'm half Japanese half white..minority. But still Alexander Hamilton & Aaron Burr... were white...so keep main characters white...WHY CHANGE IT<br/><br/>And why rap and or rhythm blues in period costumes<br/><br/>Anytime whenever people make a rendition of an orginal...its Bad. Cant understand why or how this is scoring 9.2. No one knows or cares outside of the US WTF this trash is about. Is it part of Trump2020 campaign? What I liked out of this was Lin-Manuel Miranda and the costumes, both were great.<br/><br/>What I didn't like:<br/><br/>-music, now I am a broadway fan and like this type of stuff but there are only a few memorable numbers out of like 30 (I didn't keep track) just wasn't enough to sustain the length of this play. Plus the better ones seemed to be towards the second half after you've sustained for over an hour.<br/><br/>-and speaking of plays it's a filmed play, it either works or it doesn't and here I think the camera cuts detracted from it they could be odd and distracting. I'm not sure it could be done as a straight film like Evita, in which case you want better camera cuts. It was inconsistent too so sometimes it was OK then other times it would jar you out of the element.<br/><br/>This is something I'd prefer to see as the actual play in person. I think it would deliver better. I hate to give it 5 stars because I wanted to like It.<br/><br/>Plays to film vary a lot on how they come across. Cats was inexplicably bad. Rent was decent but better in Theater. Phantom of the Opera is also better in Theater. Evita is almost better as a film.<br/><br/>Hamilton comes off somewhere dead in the middle. Whether you like this is probably strictly going to depend on your preferred viewing.<br/><br/>My personal advice? Wait and see this as a play in person unless you are bored like I was. The show and cast are unbelievable. Such a gift to a of us that they recorded the original cast and are now making it so readily available.<br/><br/>Filming was excellent but there are significant issues with the audio. Specifically, their voices are generally on the center (or center/left/right) channel(s) like most movies. But then they randomly cut in and out of the surround channels as well. This happens right in the middle of when they're talking or singing. It's clearly a mistake/unintentional and is super distracting. Listening on a 7.2.4 system and rewinded to make sure it wasn't my system - nope, always messes up the same way in the same spots. Please fix the sound issues, and then this will be perfection! The show itself is fantastic and it lives up to all the hype its been getting for five years. I've been listening to the music for years but I've never been able to afford going to the actual show so I'm really happy that it's more accessible now.<br/><br/>The choreography is fantastic. All the dances are so seamless and the dancers are incredibly talented and skilled. The main cast members are all fantastic. Lin-Manuel Miranda is a perfect charismatic and witty Hamilton but the real star of the show in my opinion is Leslie Odom Jr. as Aaron Burr. His voice is so beautiful and he has amazing vocal range. I love all the music as I previously stated, but the performances add a lot of emotion and meaning to those songs.<br/><br/>My only issue has nothing to do with the show itself and is more of a personal preference. I didn't like how they tried to replicate the Broadway experience. I just wanted to watch Hamilton but there's like an annoying laugh track since they filmed this with an audience. Overall, it's definitely worth a watch, even if the three hour run time scares you . "Hamilton" takes a giant leap from stage to screen and couldn't be more sensational, outstanding and groundbreaking.
.
In this broadway musical, it tells the life story of one of America's founding fathers and first Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton. Captured live on Broadway from the Richard Rodgers Theater with the original Broadway cast.
.
Having never seen the broadway production, this screen adaptation made me feel like I was right there. Lin-Manuel Miranda is the definition of creative genius. The book, the music, the rhymes and a great story; how does he do it all? Everyone in the supporting cast is exceptional as well and the screen direction from Thomas Kail is jaw dropping. When speaking about how "Hamilton" is a pop-culture phenomenon; how can it not be? The hype is real, people. Here are actors of colour playing the white-ass founding fathers. Right there, ballsy. The music is whole other thing that I'll be listening to for the next six months. The entire "Hamilton" experience is a must-see - it left me floored and I would love to see it live eventually.

Follow @snobmedia for all reviews! American nationalistic propaganda at its best!<br/><br/>Some of the songs were okey, but most of them are just pure nationalistic propaganda focused to convince the younger generations of a revisionist history. This musical gets a 10/10 if you see it in the theatre, a 9/10 if you listen to the recording, but what I don't understand is why Disney censored the profanity.<br/><br/>That is part of what Hamilton and his colleagues were fighting for, among many other things.<br/><br/>I have NEVER seen a streaming service do this: I watch Netflix, Amazon Prime, Apple, Hulu and Acorn and NONE of them censor their material. The fact that Disney did this to get a TV-14 rating is inexcusable. This show is NOT family-friendly, and for someone under that age to see it you'd need to take out the references to sex, prostitution, and even more censoring of curse words.<br/><br/>I will change the rating when Disney comes to their senses and releases the piece the way it was meant to be seen. Not an American so was unaware of historical inaccuracies. Did not have any knowledge of the content so the hip-hop/rap was a big surprise and disappointment. If you're going to modernize history then lose the dated costumes. Imagine if Godspell was done in 1st century dress? It would lose all its charm. I also wanted to hear the songs from Godspell over and over. There isn't one song in this I want to ever hear again. Musically it was good, however despite changing all of the heroic characters as people of color the musical fails to show actual people of color who did participate in the Revolution. It also makes Hamilton and other characters like Washington out to be innocent of slavery while vilifying only t.Jefferson of it when in fact they all participated. I was hoping for more. Again musically it was good, not great, but historically it ignores major character flaws while focusing only on positive attributes. He picks what characteristic or virtues of Hamilton to even bring up, while sweeping his shady stuff under the rug. I'm not going to give it a rating,, but I will say this. I thought this musical had some pretty good moments that were spaced out with a lot of the same stuff over and over between them. I wasn't overly engaged. I couldn't really stay focused on the show.<br/><br/>Now, I realize that I'm one of the few that probably feels this way. For everyone else that loves the show,,, go for it 👍
It's just not for me. The title detailing this review is not written lightly. I've seen great musicals, animated and live-action, since I was a child. The Wizard of Oz, The Lion King, An American in Paris, Aladdin, The Sound of Music, Frozen, the list goes on and on but never have I been moved so much than with this powerful expression of art that NEEDS to be seen by all who can potentially see it.<br/><br/>I am not often moved to genuine, personal tears after watching a movie or musical but this one got me. I cried while watching the musical but that was toward the story elements which managed to break me..and then I cried afterward with disbelief that I had seen a musical of this incredible scale starring men and women of color in a light that felt natural rather than forced or politically motivated.<br/><br/>I've been waiting to see this musical for years and now, having got an up-close and personal 160 minute look at it, it deserves every award that it can get and if it can get more awards then darn it, give it to these wonderful people who brought this thing to life. The music, the choreography, the production, the sheer scope of brilliance poured into this musical is FANTASTIC and honestly one of the greatest things I have ever seen.<br/><br/>I must also thank Disney and Disney+ for bringing this masterpiece into my life. Wow! Wow! Wow! I listened to the soundtrack, saw it live, and am now on my third viewing on Disney+... and it just keeps getting better! Genius. I love hip hop but I hate when people can't rap. You know where you hear the same monotonous cadence for every verse. Lin Manuel Miranda being the biggest offender. Ugh, his voice and presence on stage just isn't commanding.<br/><br/>The minimal set and costumes are refreshing but I didn't see the need for dancers. Another con is the storyline. Instead of taking a snapshot of Hamilton's life and amplifying it, which would've made it more interesting, we skim through his ENTIRE life at a rapid fire place. As a consequence, I didn't feel for any character least of all Hamilton and his expected fate. I had to create an IMDb account so I could write this review. I never understood how people could say something like a movie or musical could change their life but I have to admit this is life-changing. When I first started listening to the soundtrack in late 2016, it was after Prince, David Bowie, Glenn Frey and others passed away. Hamilton was the bright spot in an otherwise yuck year. Then this movie comes out- oh my God. To see the original Broadway cast and such an amazing production- it's beyond anything I've ever seen before. It's not perfect, but that's what makes it great. If you're a fan of '90s rap, broadway show tunes, or history, then this is for you. If I could give it a higher rating than 10 I would. Awesome in the true sense of the word! I always thought Hamilton was about something boring but the music in this song was actual vibes, all the cast can rap and sing and Hamilton was really a ladies man tho So many emotional moments of joy and sadness. The music and lyrics are next level! Amazingly talented artists who deliver a pitch perfect story. So glad it made it to Disney Plus where everyone can experience this standard. Being able to sit in Melbourne Australia and watch this when I wouldn't have made it to NYC is a real gift. The music and story of Hamilton is AMAZING, sadly i felt the recording left much to desire. Don't get me wrong i loved it but i do recommend everyone to listen to the soundtrack on its own. Maybe 2 songs are memorable that you might be humming the next day, but the rest are completely unforgettable, and VERY long
The costumes and set design are awesome, if you like rapid fire rap throughout the whole show then this is for you, the King George character is really the star of the show... The rap music almost made me stop, luckily there are songs later. I don't like Lin-Manuel Miranda's voice. Stunning and Brave. As someone who has been obsessed with Hamilton ever since it came out, but had never gotten the opportunity to see it, this was exactly what I had hoped for. I felt like I was actually there watching the musical. The direction was perfect for the screen, and I am convinced that they should do this more often for other musicals. Hamilton will go down as one of the greatest broadway productions ever. As close to being in the theater as you can get. Great recording, great performances, catchy music, and a compelling story. Another "brilliant" thing from americans.. this was worse than getting acid in my eyes.
Stay away from this so called masterpiece Puke and gag!<br/><br/>whenever you see a rating this high on such trash, you know there is more to it than the movie itself. This is just nasty propaganda. The play is great and even a filmed version removing much of the allure of a live performance to be offered for streaming has the benefit of reaching the masses, especially during the pandemic when theatrical venues are largely closed. But, Disney's boast that the filmed version "combines the best elements of live theatre, film and streaming" is wrong. This isn't film; it's a recorded stage production.<br/><br/>Granted, such filmed plays, or live captures, have gotten better over the years, but besides some occasional virtuosity in an overhead view or a re-staged set-up absent an audience edited in, the multi-camera setup is basically a modest improvement on the three-camera system invented for TV sitcoms in the middle of the last century. The stage lighting isn't flat, but it's inconsistent as a result. There isn't the benefit of the single-camera style and individual lighting setups of cinema. Plus, most of the cameras are from a stationary position, and they're always of the same stage with barely altered furnishings between scenes. Even some of the actors play multiple roles. There's always the missing fourth wall; even when the camera pulls back to reveal the live audience, it's merely pushing that wall back. In short, this isn't a movie adaptation. For that, one needs to reconceive the play in cinematic terms--not just where to fit the cameras inside a theatre.<br/><br/>Without going through a major studio process, the gold standard for such an adaptation to my mind is Guy Maddin's "Dracula: Pages from a Virgin's Diary" (2002), which took a ballet performance intended for TV and altered the production for cameras that rather danced in collaboration with the performers in a film that also stylistically matched the mute art form of ballet with that of silent film. Moreover, Maddin's film was actually shot on real film. The difference between these two recordings couldn't be more stark. It's like calling an episode of "I Love Lucy" and "Lawrence of Arabia" (1962) both motion pictures; it may be technically true, but they're not really the same thing.<br/><br/>That said, the recording is sufficient enough for one to appreciate the brilliance of the theatrical musical, which does more than make founding father Alexander Hamilton cool enough to remain on the ten dollar bill. Adapting 18th and early-19th century history, as based on the book by one of the best popular biographers in the business, Ron Chernow, into a display of modern popular music and starring a largely non-white cast is aptly revolutionary and a reminder of America's multicultural history as a country of immigrants, enslaved and otherwise. That's history that continues to be lived and told. Kudos for that to Lin-Manuel Miranda, who also stars in the titular part. It also helps, of course, that the acting and songs are uniformly excellent (although, with the slight caveat that rhyming "new," as in "New York," with "new," as in "new man" wasn't particularly creative), and that it's quite funny, to boot, especially if one is familiar with the early history of the United States. Among the supporting cast, I'm especially fond of Daveed Diggs's portrayal of Thomas Jefferson, including the cabinet meetings turned rap battles between him and Hamilton.<br/><br/>The narrative, too, does well to establish Hamilton's relationship with Aaron Burr, foreshadowing the fatal duel. It also does its best to feature women, who, if they're not Betsy Ross or Abigail Adams, tend to hardly be mentioned in depictions of the American Revolutionary period. The play also does some interesting stagings equivalent to cinematic techniques in camera movement, tempo and montage. Actors move as if in slow motion sometimes. The floor moves characters around in lieu of crosscutting. So, indeed, enjoy streaming "Hamilton," but let's not pretend that this is photographically brilliant as well. Hopefully, the musical will be truly transmuted cinematically someday. Before this, I did not know a thing about the history of the US. This musical has definitely been quite informative.<br/><br/>Also, given that I'm a fan of romance, I found the romantic aspects of the movie to be slightly lacking and preferred other musicals such as Phantom of the Opera.<br/><br/>However, that does not mean that I did not enjoy this movie. On the contrary, I found this musical to be very fresh and different from regular musical with its tons of rapping. The acting is also spectacular. Do NOT believe the hype and jump on the bandwagon this musical is so overrated its not even funny!!!!! IT SOUNDS TERRIBLE and lin manuel miranda is not even talented, also he manages to avoid saying anything of any actual meaning and just makes a useless annoying piece of pointless media This was an exciting thing for me. I, like most people, had heard of Hamilton. It was/is a HUGE phenomenon on Broadway and launched the careers of some incredible people. Miranda is always the fun, quirky, goofy musical wizard that pops up in shows now and then. Leslie Odom Jr. has always had this impishly wicked energy to him. Oh, and lets not forget Daveed Diggs, the up and comer who, after Blindspotting and a couple other things, I would watch in just about anything. Unfortunately, I live light years away from any decent stage so the odds of me seeing this in real life seemed like something that may just never happen. Enter the magical world of Disney and I am given the opportunity to finally experience the phenomenon myself, albeit not in the original form. Of course, with all the build up and all the hype, I was worried it couldn't possibly measure up.<br/><br/>Now, to be perfectly honest, I knew next to nothing about this before watching it. I knew that Miranda created it, I knew Diggs was in it and I had some vague notion that it was about Alexander Hamilton, the founding father, and that it was a musical. I know that might seem like a lot and yet when this kicked off I felt completely blindsided by what I got. The music was catchy in a way I hadn't anticipated, to the point that I'm listening to the soundtrack right now as I write this out. The performances were full of life and energy and charisma, every character so wonderfully brought to life with Miranda and the performer's visions. Though, I have to say that Jonathan Groff as King George was an absolute scene stealer every second he was on stage.<br/><br/>There are two magic tricks I think Hamilton not only pulls off, but pulls off effortlessly. First, the cast is remarkably diverse. This is never made into a "thing" or used as some tool to drive home some clumsy point in the way a lot of movies do, instead they're just people, people who do an exceptional job and I love that. I never once felt like a single person was miscast or not befitting their role and honestly, the fact that they never draw overt attention to it allows each actor to simply play their part exceptionally. Secondly, this draws attention to an imperfect man of great significance in American history that... Yeah, I'm sure I learned about him in school but honestly didn't know all that much about him. The fact that they essentially make something that's one part highly entertaining musical and another part educational and historical piece is wonderful.<br/><br/>Negatives? I only really have one and it's sort've minor. There are a LOT of characters portrayed here and a lot of the actors play more than one role and it can be difficult at times to keep things straight. This is a fleeting issue, a few minutes after an actor steps into a new character and it's clear who they are, but there's that initial moment of 'Huh?' that can be briefly distracting. I get the feeling this is just a part of stage shows and I'm just the uncivilized dullard that doesn't know better but it is what it is.<br/><br/>Now, as of me writing this, Hamilton is under fire and on the ever-growing cancel list. I don't agree with that. No, it doesn't focus on all of his faults, but Hamilton definitely doesn't portray Alexander as a saint by any means, not in my eyes. I think this absolutely worth watching and forming your own opinion on. Do the actions of the real man that died in 1804 mean that a 2020 musical can't be enjoyed? Can we judge the past with modern sensibilities? These are the deep, philosophical issues that this can bring out and I think these are discussions worth having. Personally, I separate the art from the inspiration and found this to be wildly entertaining. If you don't believe you are able or willing to do that, then your experience may vary wildly and that is perfectly alright by me. I really did feel like I was in The Room Where It Happened. Even though the only flaw if I can call it that is some continuity errors like the ever changing flower. I've seen Hamilton in the U.S. tour and it was amazing but I missed a few minutes because I ran to the bathroom when it wasn't packed. I'm also poor so my daughter and I were in the mezzanine which binoculars came in handy ðŸ¤£
So, it's so amazing to feel up close and personal with the original cast. Jonathan Groff might want to work on that shower he spews or Broadway won't invite him back in the time of COVID Genius! This is great! It was simply amazing! I love how diverse it is while telling the story of Hamilton. This is a masterpiece. Even someone like me who doesn't like history at all can enjoy this. Act 1 has beautiful songs and great raps. Act 2 has emotional and great written songs. The whole musical is wonderful. I'm so glad we had the luxury of watching it on Disney plus. So glad this was made and is a must watch. But p.s, if you don't understand the lyrics of a song, look it up because it's much more enjoyable that way and I t won't really make sense to you I went in blind, not really knowing anything about the musical or what it was about and was blown away. The difficulty level in the stage play was off the scale. Highly recommend If you like musicals, you will LOVE Hamilton.
Definitely worth the watch I can't deny the phenomenon of the the first mass media hip-hopera. I can see why it was hit . That being said, it seemed to me to lack the true signature melody that makes really great musicals classic. It was not the kind of show that I would feel compelled to go see again and again as I might other true classics of the stages. I think it's novelty is largely what propelled this show to its status, not necessarily its excellent writing.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it, but it lacked any solid hook aside from the overall concept. Lin-Manuel Miranda's performance was absolute garbage. He can't act, sing, or dance. Maybe next time try casting someone decent instead of starring in your own show. Hamilton itself is amazing as a musical, 10/10.<br/><br/>This is not well produced. The sound mix is fairly awful, levels are all wrong. Color balancing not well done, really bleached the stage. Weird cuts done with cameras, very awkward angles for some shots, poorly timed changes.<br/><br/>They have had four years to clean this up into a spotless copy and this is what we get? Great that it's getting to the masses but would have liked better copy. I have seen it three times on the stage in London and now to appreciate the original cast is awesome. It is by far the cleverest musical of all time. Like the rest of the world, I watched "Hamilton" on Disney Plus this weekend. Though I have seen a number of stage musicals, I haven't seen "Hamilton" yet, so this was my first opportunity to see the highly regarded show and I have to say that it didn't disappoint.<br/><br/>Alexander Hamilton (Lin-Manuel Miranda) rises up from extremely humble beginnings to play a key role in the American War of Independence. His life sees him befriend, and then rival, Aaron Burr (Lesile Odom Jr) as both a military leader and then a statesman in the burgeoning country. He marries Eliza Schuyler (Phillipa Soo) but his infidelity proves to be the undoing of his reputation and the end of his progress.<br/><br/>So I want to consider the show and the production separately, to give a fair appraisal.<br/><br/>First the show. I really enjoyed it. I've always harboured concerns that the style of music might be too much of a deviation from established musicals, but really it isn't. I initially didn't think that any of the songs were as instantly memorable as some other musicals, but in fairness I've been humming bits from several of them since. The first half of the show focuses on his military career and the second as he serves under George Washington establishing financial systems and his family life. My only issue with the show was that several actors play two roles on either side of the interval and I wasn't totally clear that they had changed. There's no one actor that I could single out for special praise, because frankly, everyone is fantastic and it's gratifying to see so many of these particular cast taking Broadway and Hollywood roles.<br/><br/>The production is great though. Single stage setting, with two turntables in the middle helping to keep things dynamic. There's a wide establishing shot, from a production with an audience present, that the reactions are taken from. This is cut with a series of closer shots from an onstage camera that must come from a series of audience free runs, which provide another level of depth and intimacy that is otherwise impossible. It's honestly the way that all stage performances need to be shot from now on.<br/><br/>No recording is ever going to capture what it's like to see a show live, with a reacting audience but this is as close as we're likely to get and it's wonderful that this particular version has been memorialised forever. The time has come. The lights go down. King George III welcomes us to the show. Hamilton has finally arrived in a beautiful HD presentation! You've heard of it, you've listened to it more times than you can count, you've bopped to it and belted the words on your friend's aux to their absolute shock/confusion. Now we can FINALLY enjoy it on loop over and over again on a non bootleg copy, that's right NO MORE SLIME
TUTORIALS! Considering it's called a "Hamilton film I would say it's right in my ballpark don't you?? First of all, the show is amazing. It's among the best the stage has to offer in the modern age. The music, the performances, the writing, the production, it's all BEAUTIFUL, if you haven't seen it yet WATCH IT NOW, but what truly makes it SO good? In the words of Lin Manuel Miranda, "It's a story about America then, as told by America now." The Founding Fathers are played by actors of color, among other characters featured in the story. The show is having us leave whatever cultural baggage we have about these historical figures at the door, and embracing this story through the eyes of America NOW. Yes it does leave some factors out, yes it's not all historically accurate, but people need to realize the point isn't to tell an IN DEPTH biographical story of Hamilton, but rather show us how his life and the events that he took part in helped form the foundations and ideals of what this country was built upon. This show is very Patriotic but it reminds me of what America is SUPPOSE TO BE. WHAT IT COULD BE. Much like the young people of my generation going out and marching for the racial injustices in this country, Hamilton was a 20 year old immigrant that fought for the freedom of this land and helped shaped the principles in which we aspire to uphold. This show isn't going to acknowledge our systemic racism roots with people like Washington and Jefferson who factually owned slaves, but it challenges us to contemplate our OWN feelings about this country and where we came from. How far have we come? What has changed and what could WE do better? Could our founding fathers have done more to abolish slavery? Absolutely, but think about what they did try to create and lay the foundations for. Who knows what they could've done if they had more time? It's not meant to idolize these people, it's a piece about the birth of America, and what people like Hamilton did to help a struggling new country find its own identity. When I watch/listen to this show, I believe in that. I believe that America WAS already great, we just lost sight of it and let the wrong people get in charge. If you want to know why, watch Hamilton. The story of an immigrant that fought in a war, and made a name for himself in a ludicrous political game, is a story that will be remembered for generations. Miranda and his team found an incredible medium to tell these people's stories, and that's what it's all about, who tells our story? How will we be remembered? Hamilton's now available on Disney+, I highly suggest you watch it for your 4th of July this weekend and many days after... But as a final reminder don't forget, this is at its heart, live theatre. Hopefully when Covid ends we can actually experience it all together the way we're suppose to, in front of the stage, LIVE. But for now, this will of course do! 10/10. Don't waste your time on this Huge pile of garbage!!!!! There is an amazing amount to talent on the stage, but musically it still doesn't often impress.
Lin-Manuel Miranda seems to have used Les Miserables as a template. Changing the music to rap works and allows for much more exposition but the melodies are pretty weak, so the use of musical themes to bring the audience quickly into a scene don't work as well as it does in Les Mis.
The story is the tale of an ambitious, vain, loudmouthed and unpleasant man. Hamilton does not seem likeable, so I don't care about him at all.
The single worst part is Lin-Manuel Miranda himself. He is OK as an actor but not a singer on par with the other voices on stage.<br/><br/>It's not all bad:
Hamiltons version of the innkeeper from Les Mis is King George played by Jonathan Groff (Kristoff from Frozen) and this is the only part where it truly matches Les Mis. It's both funny, has a good tune and is well executed.
RenÃ©e Elise Goldsberry deserves a mention. None of her numbers would be anything special without her. She has a presence and voice that is remarkable.
Phillipa Soo who plays the wife of Hamilotn gets to end the musical with the only number that had me actually involved - and that's all about Eliza Hamilton's achievements after her husbands demise. Hamilton is patriotic, moving and simply a masterpiece. I watched it for the first time on 7/3. I've watched 3 more times since then and can't wait to watch it again. Every performance is gripping and full of emotion. I cried, laughed, sobbed and just felt everything. Thank you for making this! Highly recommend. Music is great, but the sound quality is flawed in this production.<br/><br/>Didn't understand why they used at least 2 of the prominent performers in more than one role. I was brought up with West Side Story, and An American in Paris. My mum and dad loved the musicals, it made them happy. I'm sure that they would have loved this one, my mum would have rated it as enchanting, innovative, and 'up with it' (or whatever label people used before 'woke' was trending).
Don't get me wrong: this is an extremely well put together production, professional to a t. Mr Miranda is undoubtedly a talented, innovative and charismatic artist. I wasn't born in America, but I get the historical significance of the story, and how it resonates in the current Zeitgeist. I also understand the symbolic affirmation of the casting strategy. In other words, everything you have read in the other raving reviews is probably true. Many people will love it, because it manages to pull on many powerful strings.
However, despite all the production values, the innovative score (I am sure that anyone looking closely enough will find elegant musical references from Rogers and Hammerstein to rap, the Beatles and several prog-rock concept albums from the 70s), the spectacular staging and direction, the excellent singing and dancing, and all the other qualities of the show, and despite all these efforts, 2 hours into this I am bored stiff with this piece. It does have its moments, but these are too few and far between. Hamilton is a snooze fest!
I guess that if you are a die-hard fan of traditional Broadway musicals, you'll enjoy the show. I felt that the whole thing, even when the score meanders out-of-bounds into rap or -dare, me- jazz, remains a stereotypical, deeply awkward, singing dialogue musical which left me cold. I did not find it had a single catchy, memorable tune, Mack The Knife, oh where art thou?
A few months ago, before the lock-down, I was looking forward to parting with a very large handful of hard-earned smackeroos to book a seat for one of the traveling performances coming to my godforsaken little Canadian town -not quite New York prices, but quite expensive by local standards. I had heard about Hamilton for several years, and I even researched booking a trip to NY to see it.
As it turns out, the tour was cancelled -and for that I am truly sorry for the cast and crew- and then I experienced the show electronically, in a safe and carefully social distant environment. Perhaps I might have enjoyed it more in person at a live performance? That's possible.
I can't but feel disappointed. For me, the show did not live up to the massive hype, hence a 6/10. The performances and acting is great. The writing is good, but the overall narrative is pretty strange. It feels like a story with revisions made to be more palatable to a liberal white audience, including the soundtrack. It's very enjoyable and has some great songs but feels like it's designed to not make too many waves, to me. Glad it put money in PoC pockets though, and hope that the next production can perhaps have more control. Good songs, good plot, good everything basically, but someone needs to explain to Lin that there's a difference between establishing musical themes for different subjects and between having the same character sing the same song 5 times with slight lyric changes. That's not smart that's just lazy and it makes the musical longer than it should be. I think it would have been better if it would be 30 minutes shorter and less repetetive.
This musical is still great though, don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it and I think almost everything about it is done fantastically, but this little detail of repeating the same songs over and over made this thing feel long and slightly exhausting to watch. Review:
'Hamilton' is a Broadway musical filmed for TV with music and lyrics by Lin-Manuel Miranda. It tells the story of American Founding Father Alexander Hamilton. The show's music draws heavily from hip hop, as well as R&B, pop, soul, and traditional-style show tunes.
I've heard about the Broadway musical for years now but being located in a small town there was no way I would be able to see the show. When I heard it was coming to Disney+ I was both excited and nervous due to the fact I wasn't sure if it would be a victim of overhype. I'm am happy to be able to say this is a true masterpiece of a show that will make you want to revisit it again and again,
The show casts non-white actors as the Founding Fathers and other historical figures and it is truly brilliant. It showcases the actor's talents and makes a stand against racial stereotypes and Xenophobia. It is both amazing and heartbreaking watching these actors on the big stage. They are brilliant in the way the move and remember their lines during this three-hour long event. Stage shows and their actors are an underappreciated form of art and storytelling. Everybody in this show did a perfect job, but there was one actor who seemed to be having a blast in his role and played two completely different character perfectly, Daveed Diggs.
Aside from having an incredible story of the 'lost' Founding Father, Alexander Hamilton, the show has a brilliant soundtrack that has seamless transitions between scenes. It keeps your eyes glued to the screen and you don't want the show the end. With having super limited space and production design, they were able to showcase different parts of the world and the United States just by having different dress codes and props, and it is done with ease.
Overall, I am urging everybody to watch this amazing piece of art. If you are a fan of musicals you will love this, and if you aren't the biggest fan of musicals I truly believe that the music in this show alone will keep you engage and intrigued to what the story is telling.
5/5 I really do enjoy the Hamilton soundtrack and was so excited to actually view the performance! However, in a sense, I do think I have listened to the soundtrack too much to the point where I 'know' what happens too well. For watching the musical, I recommend not over-saturating oneself with other Hamilton media.<br/><br/>All in all, it is an excellent musical with brilliant writing, excellent performances, and a memorable, multi-layered, story. So thankful that there is a version of the beloved musical that is easily accessible to those who haven't seen it live. I had always loved to listen to Hamilton with my family in long car rides and around the house, but seeing it was a whole new level of enjoyment.<br/><br/>The Cinematography and the Choreography were what really made the show fantastic for me. I loved how many of the extras did the parts of stage crew within the dancing they had in specific songs.<br/><br/>The entire play was authentic and original. The singing was not auto-tuned as so much of the music is today.<br/><br/>Throughout this play/movie a wide range of emotions were conveyed as well. There was humor (especially with the King George songs), sadness (largely at the end of the showing) and triumph (winning the battle of Yorktown).<br/><br/>The writing was genius in which the introductory melody was used with different words throughout the play, as well. The finale had a similar thing where many of the songs played a part and many different words were reused in a genius way. I loved this and would watch it again. I am sad that due to coronavirus this musical is not still being performed live, but would like to see it when possible.<br/><br/>9.3/10 :) This 2016 movie of the stage show is excellent for a lot of reasons. The cast has a lot to do with that. Every cast member makes their role real and memorable. They do it smoothly. They earn the massive applause they receive for each number. It's easy to see why.<br/><br/>This filming of a Broadway Stage show has been done in movie history, but only a few times as effectively. If you go back to silent films, ironically since Disney is producing this, the 1925 silent of Peter Pan (before Disney animated it) was really a film of the broad way stage show of Peter Pan. If you have never seen it, and can tolerate a silent film, you'd be surprised how effective that silent is filming the stage show.<br/><br/>The cast pulls out all the stops here and the orchestra is heard but not seen doing excellent score music from the pit. Manuel's story from the real history is well done, and the songs and dancing fits perfectly. As for the politics, yes this show has "Quid Pro Quo" in it in 2016, way before it became a famous quote on the news before the Corona Virus. There's another issue mentioned here when on character states that America can't be expected to help every country in conflict in the world. We are really proving that now, so in 2016 while this was addressing Obama's foreign policy, regime change, now it is current because our US media is actively trying to change regimes in the world. The internet has made US media drunk with power, and it's not always for the good.<br/><br/>I will say one thing is incomplete here. They mention some of the amazing stuff Hamilton's wife did after he died, but her story needs to be done someplace. She lived 50 years after her husband and did things many women should be proud of.<br/><br/>Now as far as Slavery not getting a lot of attention, no story of history can be perfect. In fact, the longest serving slaves in US History are Women. Women could not vote until the 20th Century and it was the 1960's before they were no longer expected to stay home, not work, and be at the mercy of their husbands. Women are smarter though because instead of asking for pity and reparations, they have worked inside the system to improve it and we might be on the verge of a Black Woman Vice-President. (Possibly President as well) It's way over due.<br/><br/>History has already been written and no amount of revision or destruction can change history. The fact is we need to look back at history and realize that "The Future Matters." If we fail to do this, we owe women more than we owe anyone else because of the past. I hope someone does a sequel to this and tells the whole story of Mrs. Hamilton. We owe her that. There has been a lot of controversy regarding this release, especially with regards to the state of the world with COVID-19 still dominating, but this was so fantastic. I live in a small town in remote Australia. I bet you can guess how many times I have had the opportunity to see a Broadway show, but damn have I dreamed. While I completely understand that live stage shows have a magic that is near impossible to replicate, I NEED to thank Disney for trying.<br/><br/>Lin-Manuel Miranda was incredible, and such a goofball. The sisters three were captivating. I couldn't take my eyes off of Renée especially. What a voice! And my dear Jonathan Groff, while his part was small, really deserves more recognition. I will forever be referencing his Groffsauce.<br/><br/>When this is all over, dear reader, make sure you go out and support the live shows. Support the actors. The crew. The writers. The producers. The directors. This is such a hard time for anyone in the creative industry, but we need them. We need to help them get back on their feet for what is life without creativity? Yes, I was one of the poor folk who couldn't afford to see it in person... but to see the original cast in #hamilfilm is probably even better!! SO much talent represented here, but what struck me the most was Lin-Manuel's range of expression. What a talented human being. Hamilton became the most popular musical in recent years for a good reason. It tells an interesting story through beautiful lyrics, music, and acting. The Broadway musical is incredible, and anyone who was able to see it in person are extremely lucky. With the recording finally released, anyone can get the front row feeling in their home.<br/><br/>To the many who have listened to Hamilton countless times, this is your movie. To the many who have never seen Hamilton and know nothing about the revolutionary war, this is your movie. Hamilton tells the story of a founding father. It tells of his success through his many failures and flaws.<br/><br/>Personally, I loved the recording. It felt very well produced. The mixing was great, except I felt like some songs could have been louder for emphasis. An additional thing that I would like to say is that there is no autotune in this recording, which makes these three shine: Christopher Jackson, Daveed Diggs, and Phillipa Soo.<br/><br/>9/10, very rewatchable. Lin-Manuel Miranda is a brilliant creative mind and I do love the musical itself. However, he simply cannot act, sing, or dance. It is quite off-putting to have him on stage with such talented people around him.... he stands out like a sore thumb and really should have let someone more capable take the stage. Everything else is great! Hamilton is an amazing achievement. Lin-Manuel Miranda has done a fantastic job of showcasing that he's a man capable of accomplishing great things with little to no help. Hamilton was, to my understanding, largely done by himself and has amassed a cult-like following of individuals, many of whom have attended the Broadway show multiple times to laugh, cry and sing along to the catchy hip-hop music. So intense is the crowd of Hamilton supporters that to even say something potentially critical of the performance will lead to an inevitable attack and silencing.<br/><br/>There are some really good things that can be said about this production, and I will say them. There are also, however, some critical things that must be said about it as well, and I will say them. If you're the kind of person who follows this play religiously to the point of being blinded into believing it does absolutely no wrong, click away now. Because this is an unbiased opinion from someone experiencing the play for the very first time on Disney+.<br/><br/>Firstly, it's extremely efficient in its use of the stage. It does an absolutely fantastic job of telling its story without the need to do a whole lot of changing on the stage. If the production we've seen on Disney+ is any indication, it's fairly rapidfire with the musical numbers from beginning to end, not stopping for prop changes but rather doing so as it goes along, which is not just impressive, but admirable. Also, it's extremely well shot. It can be increasingly difficult to keep an audience viewing at home invested in a production that takes place on a single stage, but the direction for this production was stellar. There was never a moment where the play felt boring or that it was beginning to drag, which, for a 2 hour 40 minute piece, isn't an easy task to accomplish. The team hired to handle this production did an absolutely stellar job with it.<br/><br/>That being said, as impressive as it is that Lin-Manuel Miranda did this entire musical mostly by himself, there are also some downfalls. The choice to stick almost exclusively to the hip-hop genre was a mistake, with many lyrical and flow repetitions that, rather than helping to establish and distinguish character, are just simply annoying. In any musical piece, there's always a theme that runs throughout the piece that comes back at multiple times, always the strongest during one of the most integral moments of the piece. This production acts as if far too many moments are integral, or "the" moment that it gets very annoying.<br/><br/>Overall, however, it's an enjoyable production, and something I'd like to see done live on the stage. The fanbase is a little off-putting, hence this being the first time I've experienced the show after being put off by the fan reactions to opposing viewpoints. The fans have made it a pretentious mess, however, separate from everything but the production itself, this was a lot of fun. Great job Disney, thanks for making it available for us. My wife and I managed 10 minutes, which i forced on my wife.
Look at all the reviews, its got 9 out of 10 it must be really good.
I told her we would give it 15 minutes, after 3 it was so painful, surely it must get better, no it didn't.
We are so easy going and give anything a try, I even for my sins like watching sub titled movies from all different parts of the world, and love a good musical, my music preference is r and b, dance and soul, maybe I am just old and don't get it. I've watched the show live in NY and in SF and this is my advice to get the most raw live realism possible out of this movie of a live recording.<br/><br/>The movie was released at 24fps which is good for normal cinematic movies but for live shows or live sports you want 60fps for realism. You achieve this by turning on the frame interpolation on your TV also known as the soap opera effect. With this feature on your TV will generate the in-between frames missing to make it look like it was recorded at 60fps and it will look more like what you see in real life. The performance will look more honest and you will be able to appreciate the show more for what it is.<br/><br/>TV's have different names for the same setting so here is a few to help you find it:<br/><br/>Motion Smoothing
Motion Interpolation
Sports Effect
Action Smoothing
TruMotion
Motionflow<br/><br/>The raw liveness of the show is already compromised since it was made with the recordings of 15 separate shows in the span of 3 days and was mixed to look like a single performance (2 with a live audience and 13 without to capture close-ups). Even thought the editing and mixing is exceptionally very well done it is simply impossible for the audio to match the lips perfectly on every single shot. Your brain subconsciously will catch the millisecond discrepancy no matter what and it will take away from the realism. If you add an unnatural 24 frame rate the whole show looses its realism completely. 24fps for films is great because it makes the acting more dramatic and cinematic, for live shows it takes away the raw intensity of their performance.<br/><br/>Trust me on this if you want to watch a 10 and not an 8. I had always loved to listen to Hamilton with my family in long car rides and around the house, but seeing it was a whole new level of enjoyment.<br/><br/>The Cinematography and the Choreography were what really made the show fantastic for me. I loved how many of the extras did the parts of stage crew within the dancing they had in specific songs.<br/><br/>The entire play was authentic and original. The singing was not auto-tuned as so much of the music is today.<br/><br/>Throughout this play/movie a wide range of emotions were conveyed as well. There was humor (especially with the King George songs), sadness (largely at the end of the showing) and triumph (winning the battle of Yorktown).<br/><br/>The writing was genius in which the introductory melody was used with different words throughout the play, as well. The finale had a similar thing where many of the songs played a part and many different words were reused in a genius way. I loved this and would watch it again. I am sad that due to coronavirus this musical is not still being performed live, but would like to see it when possible.<br/><br/>9.3/10 :) I had the good fortune to see Hamilton in person during its 1st tour and as amazing as that was, I find this filmed performance to be possibly better. My seats were up in the back, and it's absolutely wonderful to be able to see the expressions on the actors faces, the dynamics of the choreography a bit better and to watch it with the subtitles on so that every terrific bit of lyric can be enjoyed.<br/><br/>And, yes, I had to add the above side note in the title to my review, because there is false information going around that Hamilton owned slaves. He was opposed to slavery and should certainly be faulted for not doing more to prevent it, but no, he didn't own slaves: Wow. I am at a loss for words. This is pure perfection. As a huge musical fan, it just doesn't get any better than this. I never had the chance to see the OBC live, so I have never experienced the acting, only the music. I was blown away by all the incredible perfomances, these perfomers are not only amazing singers, but some stunning actors as well.<br/><br/>I just want to thank Lin-Manuel Miranda for bringing this incredible musical to the big screen. And now I am incredibly impatient for the movie adaptation of In the Heights. But I am willing to wait for it. I also want to thank all of the people involved in making this masterpiece. You all have a special place in my heart. Also shoutout to the women of Hamilton. Phillipa Soo, Renée Elise Goldsberry and Jasmine Cephas Jones you guys are awesome.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this musical or heard the songs, do yourselves a favor and watch it. You will not regret it. Now if you'll excuse me, I'll go watch this yet again and laugh and cry some more. I will probably do that for the foreseeable future. I want to start this review by letting everyone know I have seen this show twice in person and it never ceases to blow me away. I was unable to watch this original cast live and in person, but thank you Disney for giving us this gorgeous piece of theater.<br/><br/>I am dumbfounded by these one and two star reviews calling this musical "trash" and "utter nonsense". I have been listening to the original broadway album since it was released on major music streaming services five years ago. Being able to put a face to these incredible voices is an absolute treat. To those who fail to understand what the hype is about, I feel sorry that you do not enjoy and feel the same emotions that I feel when watching. Seeing Leslie Odom Jr. as Aaron Burr, perform "Wait For It", brought a type of characterization that you simply cannot get from a recording on Spotify. His portrayal of Mr. Burr brings a sense of vulnerability and encapsulates the emotions of the human experience that I never experienced with other actors in the role. Similarly, hearing Christopher Jackson as George Washington sing "One Last Time", made me overwhelmed joy (not to mention his voice is butter) These are the voices I have spent the past five years with. I listen to them when I drive to work, go to the gym, or when I'm hanging out with friends. Now I have a live production I can watch at my fingertips!<br/><br/>Is the story 100% historically accurate? No, of course not. Is the story at its core true? Yes, I believe it is. There are too many characters that made an impact on Hamilton's life to include in a two and a half hour musical. Some things are exaggerated and some timelines are off. For example, Burr and Hamilton do not duel after Jefferson wins the presidency, it is years later for a separate, but similar matter. A ton of research went into this show, like the relationship of Hamilton, Lafayette, Mulligan, and Laurens.<br/><br/>The raps are quick witted and the music never gets old. This story has a ton of implementation for our current generation. Also, it is safe to say that Hamilton's vision of America is pretty close to where we are today in terms of capitalism and our federal government. Jefferson and Hamilton GREATLY influenced and shaped America. We owe a lot to them and I think this show eloquently gives them the credit they deserve. It's like a drug. You must keep watching and each time is incredible I laughed, I cried, I enjoyed, I loved! This musical hit me deeply. I can't say enough what an amazing job the cast and crew did. Through a lot of it, my family and I questioned how you could create something so beautiful, something so unimaginably amazing that made an impact on people, we questioned how you could take a founding father's life and make it into this. Our answer? A Latino that sure knows how to represent us. His name is Lin-Manuel Miranda. I couldn't be more proud of my heritage, even though I've always been proud of it. Long story short, I MOST CERTAINLY recommend watching "Hamilton", or if not, listen to the soundtrack! Seeing Hamilton as a film rather than the play (which I saw on Broadway with some of the main cast) has its pluses and minuses. On repeated viewings of the movie version I'm picking up things I never saw in the play, and they are magnificent. The stage version is, I say this unashamedly, the single greates piece of art in any form that I have ever experienced, but part of that was the shared experience and maybe that is the element that is missing here.<br/><br/>The film is sensational, but it also shows the flaws in a way that a live audience may not pick up. Some of the harmonies don't quite land in the film (Schuyler Sisters being the most glaring), the close ups both enhance certain moments and yet the loss of the bigger picture at times slightly detracts.<br/><br/>Any quibbles are minor in the extreme, but if the show on Broadway was a 10 (and it was), the movie is a 9.9. Tremendous, but just shy of perfection.<br/><br/>It's a cultural phenomenon for a reason, and undoubtedly there will be those who just don't get what the fuss is all about, even those who hate it. Nonetheless this is the kind of cultural event that you should participate in, even just once. The references from this show are numerous and will infuse our culture for a generation or longer.<br/><br/>But also, its just that good. I think most people will instinctively get why, even if they're foreign to theatre. Some things just touch the soul, and Hamilton has already proved it is one of those. The movie isn't the same experience, but its as close as many people will get.Don't throw away your shot. Good musical, I'm glad I was finally able to watch it since I never got a chance to do it before. Hamilton (3.5 out of 5 stars).<br/><br/>Hamilton is a pretty fair musical film that brings a musical theatre play onto the big screen. Basically, catching the play on stage, the audience that is cheering and clapping, and the set design and lighting. The musical sequences are pretty fairly entertaining with flashy set pieces. And the dance choreographer is well done. I did find the movie to be overly long with its running time of 2 hours and 40 minutes. Showing every detail of the musical. While some of the repetitive musical sequences could have been trimmed and not affect anything with the story it is trying to tell.<br/><br/>The cast is great. Lin Manuel Miranda did a great job. It does have a few good musical sequences. A good story. It may have overused a few musical sequences which added to its over long run time. Watching this did make it feel like you got the vip seat in theatre. Which they should try to bring other plays onto the big screen. I grew up when Phantom of the Opera and Les Miserables came out (and rap was new and annoying, to me). The music and the story were intoxicating. Now I really love the story of the American Revolution, though I still don't like rap much. However, the opening to Hamilton was really impressive with lyrics and rhythm. Even so, the only song that I will remember is King George's You'll Be Back. I thought that the actors did a great job, though I was bothered by black actors portraying historical figures that were Caucasian. Now don't go judging me to be prejudicial, I would be just as bothered by white actors playing black historical figures. I am anti-racial actually. I simply appreciate authenticity. Overall, I don't understand why this show is so widely loved. Yeah, it was good, but not compared to the monumental shows that came out in my youth. I thought that King George and Thomas Jefferson were really entertaining. Otherwise, I didn't find it very compelling. Never would I have ever thought that I would be watching a play about one of the founding fathers on repeat. I am so grateful this made it to the small screen for those of us who weren't able to catch the live show. Not only is just about every word sung, and beautifully at that, but the songs are done in styles to have you hanging on every word. It's the perfect amount of heavy and emotional with comedic lines and acts (thank you King George III). And while I am aware that the play does take some factual liberties, it had me googling to find out more about these people. Very intense! I knew the cast album, but it still was amazing. The performances were better than the album, more emotional. Eliza's sceenes were believable, King George was funny.
Jefferson and Hamilton go against each other, and the audience loved it. Even though I knew it was coming, Hamilton's final scene was horrible.
The audio describer was good, sometimes describing the action during the applause, before the singers started singing, or describing during a song. For example, before the Skuylar Sisters song starts he says, "Burr." Then, he said "The Skuylar sisters hold up their silk gowns, dancing in the center of the rotating stage." After that song, he describes the next one before they start singing.
Thank you, Disney Plus for funding the audio description. I hold certain people who posses a gift with words/lyrics/raps in high regard and LMM does not disappoint. You must watch this with subtitles to get the full effect of the incredibly thoughtful, quick, witty lyrics. Just you wait.... An amazing story told with a musical twist that tells the life of Hamilton in a way that i will never forget. This was fantastic, it's not the same to sit on the sofa and watch a broadway musical... so I am so pleased releasing it made that possible. It was emotional, funny and heart wrenching. The music was superb. I'm in awe of how they remembered that many words. I watched with subtitles which really helped! Absolutely perfect score from me. Their talent is completely unrivalled. Such brilliance! This show is fantastic! Thrilled it's on the big screen! So I originally wasn't going to watch or review Hamilton, but this broadway production has taken over the world so I sat down with my mum and watched the 2 hour 40 film of the production and here is my review for it. The premise of the film shows the story of Alexander Hamilton the forgotten Founding Father starting from his humble beginnings all the way to his death.
Main Character
Lin-Manuel Miranda plays Hamilton here and he is superb. This man is really talented, not only did he star here but he wrote all the songs, his singing voice is really unique and really works here. He brings plenty of emotion to his role, I really cared about him and thought he gave a truly brilliant dramatic performance. But he also was pretty funny here with some good comedic lines, what was also great is that Hamilton is a really interesting character, he isn't this generic good guy, he has plenty of flaws and he is portrayed as a normal guy which helps the show.
Supporting Cast
I must stress everybody here is truly fantastic, even the background performers are great but here are the ones that stood out to me. Leslie Odom Jnr plays Aaron Burr the seemingly antagonist here and I thought this guy really shined, the fact his character is called Aaron like me has nothing to do with it. He has a great singing voice and again like Hamilton the character is really multi layered and a fascinating part of this production. Phillipa Soo plays Eliza Hamilton and I really saw her as the heart of this production, her relationship with Hamilton is well done and you come out of this film wanting to learn more about her and see the things that she achieved in her own right. Chris Jackson playing George Washington for me was a huge presence on the stage he was a larger then life character and he did a great job in the role. A special shoutout to Jonathan Grogg who plays King George, he isn't in the production much but he was a showstealer for me making me laugh the hardest here.
Story
The story is really interesting, we have all heard of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson but I am not sure too many have heard of Alexander Hamilton so it was great learning about this historical figure. I mean I am not sure exactly how much was accurate but it was a really interesting story, and with this being a musical using song to tell this story really worked. It made it more fun and enjoyable to study but also managed to make the dramatic scenes feel really impactful.
Script
Yes, pretty much all of the dialogue here is sung, which is impressive in its own right. But for me this was a really well written film. As mentioned above the drama really worked for me and the sprinkling of humour in there just made the story and characters even more interesting.
Style
The style of the way they filmed this production is fantastic, it feels truly epic in its production and the way it is presented. All the songs are fantastically performed and I loved the different styles of music that was here, there is a mix of rap, RNB and dramatic musical and the blend suprisingly works really well. But with this production this film is a bit long, and I get that it is a muscial so it should be long but I felt like I was pretty tired by the end of the film.
Overall
Overall, this is a truly fantastic production that all musical fans will love. But honestly, I think people who aren't a Musical fan can love it too, as I am not a Musical fan and I truly loved this film and would reccommend it to everybody. Really really good, excellent songs and super entertaining. That was the title of the "USA Today" article about this boring, weird play. I saw it on TV but friends who have seen it in NYC say the same, a snooze fest. I guess the fact that they replace white slave owners with blacks makes it less racist? Nope - huge fail to anyone involved. Skip this snore. The film version of Hamilton may not be the best choice, and the camera language may not be the best way to tell the story. But it was lucky to see the OBC team at their peak. Wish I could see this live. Absolutely amazing job by everyone. Hamilton was entertaining although the music is just not something I enjoy listening to. The acting was superb and I prefer watching plays that have been recorded as a stage production and not as a movie. But, the biggest drawback for me that even though it did present some of Hamilton's drawbacks it failed to cover the fact that he purchased slaves (even though many of the characters in the play are black) and as a Federalist he wanted a government that included a President and members of Congress to be elected for life terms. He thought that the English form of government was the best even though they had fought a war to rid themselves from that kind of rule. The end of the play suggested he was a hero and I suppose as one who fought against English rule he was but as a man he was something of a failure. The world of the playwright is a fascinating one, where the dark aspects of the classical theater are still able to take stage without so much as batting an eye. It's created stories that have been unique, often making staple works of art that not only show for months to years, but often remain in the memories of many. So given the state of COVID, as well as the limited runs with original cast and locations you can view it, I'll admit I've not been much into this venue. Disney + is trying to fix this by putting out the legendary Hamilton this weekend to let me check out. So I have, and thus I'm getting another practice review out to determine if this craze is worth the hype, or just another entry into the continued world of entertainment. Let's get started<br/><br/>Movie/Play: Hamilton (originally 2016 but 2020 release)<br/><br/>Cast:<br/><br/>Director:
Thomas Kail
Writers:
Lin-Manuel Miranda (book), Ron Chernow (inspired by the book Alexander Hamilton by)
Stars:

Clever
Powerful Messages
Some Extraordinarily Good Numbers
Fantastic Costumes

A dynamic Stage for numbers
The First Act Over The Second

I Felt Could use More Stage Changes
Dropped Story Elements

If You know History, You know The end
Does it Capture the Spirit Of The Theater?<br/><br/>SUMMARY:<br/><br/>As I said above, the theater world allows so many stories to be told and in Hamilton, the lesser known founding father gets a nice entertaining twist and is certainly the fun experience you would think. Miranda's play has poise, charm, edge, and so many other factors that make the history of the revolution fun to watch/live in once again. Much of it has to do with clever writing, jabbing at the faults of the traditional life of history, but managing to not rub its name in the mud. The asides and breaking the fourth wall made me laugh the most, especially at how well most of it flows into the lyrics of the strong music that is heavy in this film. Miranda shows how you can be political without getting too far away from the point, writing power messages into the dialogue naturally and having the performance speak as opposed to making everything about the message (see modern Hollywood/life today). Hamilton takes all this cleverness and works it into its own style of poetry using the music style to emphasize so much I think he wanted and keeping the story moving through the decade or so of major historical moments and trying to develop the title character considerably. And all of this power is brought about talented production values that help pull you back in time to the founding of our country. A talented cast with names too extensive to include, brings up the various historical legends to new heights, attitudes and the spirit of revolution oozing out of their deliveries in the first act to inspire your own movement for change. While a second act opens up more of the devious side in a spoof/magnification of the temptation political power brings. All the costumes that reflect historical Colonial upbringing are there ready to help your eyes further accept the spectacle on stage so that you again put interest into the film.
Let's face it though it's going to be the numbers that will show up on the walls of social media soon enough. Hamilton's numbers are all about that attitude and inspiration that the modern times love, and it's those empowering performances that make up the meat of this play. The emotional fervor of both acts is in almost every word of the dialogue and it does not hesitate to show the attitude that the cast wanted to bring in this time period. Using the stage's confinement to the advantage, alongside the costumes, the dance numbers have a choreographed splendor that feels organic as movements turn back into characters just going back to normal movements. It works so well in seeing the fluid transitions from duels to dance and back again, and seeing a unique approach to the performance execution. The first act in particular does this well for me, and was the better act because of the energy, fervor, and coordination the revolutionary war got in the confined 1-hour time limit. Though the second act does accomplish a similar feel and certainly has less dancing, more coordination and the likes, I particularly think the first act is Miranda's shining achievement. However, that ending monologue is powerful, with words that struck home and broke the mold of the rest of the play's fervor, a nice sendoff that leave one thinking.<br/><br/>Now here is the tricky part of talking about the dislikes, partly because I don't see many plays, part because of the hybrid movie/play, and partly due to the limitations of stage shows being streamed. Doing my best to be fair though, I can say that one of the big disappointments were some of the underutilized characters for me. Hamilton does a nice job working so many pieces through the set up, but there are several characters that held potential and showed promise that got dropped into the winds of a few songs before being lost to book footnotes. I had hoped for a little more integration and references, but understanding time constraints it's only a marginal dislike for me. What hit harder for me was more so dropping some of the plots they were working on, or perhaps rushing through them and keeping them merely one to two lines in the story. The development of Hamilton's child, the third sister, heck even some of the soldiers are all lost in quick tidbits through this rush through history. While it works in the rhyme scheme, I'm about stating if you are going to build up deliver on the end and I felt some of this was lost to the political prowess of the play. I guess if you know history well enough, you know the ending, and Miranda might have taken that into consideration when he wrote the book, focusing again on a Spark Notes version of Hamilton's life and accomplishments. This is why Hamilton has the focus, so you can try to get into his mind, while also driving the audience to do the changes that our forefathers did long ago before technology took over.
In regards to execution of the numbers well you've read I enjoyed much of the numbers. However, something this play failed to do for me was take breaks from the music and go back into dialogue to sort of give the actors time to flesh out the characters more. While good, I got tired of everything in a musical/poetry lyric, again missing key moments of tension and character building so that we can get more emotional music instead. Again, I'm unsure how other musicals work, something I have to study, but the plays I have seen have far more breaks between their performances instead of nearly just one giant musical delivery. Throw that in with if you are watching it on Disney+, the sound quality is kind of lacking thanks to the compressed file format the server uses. I found myself having to turn my speakers up more for the quiet phrases than I wanted to, only for having to turn it down again when the more energetic numbers came. Convenient as it is, I have to say that other streaming sites have got it down a little better, so I'll mention in hopes that Disney will improve upon their sound quality. Something else I as well would have liked, as I see in many musical numbers, is a more diverse soundtrack. Wicked, Avenue Q, Book Of Mormons are great examples where a genre can be seen in the musical styles, but there are slight changes and performance tweaks to make the numbers stand out. Not the case for on Hamilton. Outside of when Eliza's numbers came on, and a few moments where Hamilton's darker thoughts hit the scene, much of the numbers is the same sort of rap beat with a slight change in tempo to boot. Again, I get this was the focus of the play to have a rap play presentation, but doing it that way takes away from the originality of each track. Fortunately, King George's interventions stood out to me as comedic, a change in style to the show tune that stands aside from the rap. If your style of music choice is the rap, then this will not be an issue, because it's the perfect genre to get the emotions out and thanks to its ability to take poetry and spin it in new pieces. For me though, many of the numbers feel every much the same, and without bigger dance numbers or the usual grandiose manner I've seen in the few shows I've watched. In addition not changing up the backdrops, and relying on the one stage prop alone was again a dynamic I did not intend to watch. Lighting guys get the props for making the stage versatile, but again, Hamilton's journey through colonial times should have had more settings, but the reliance on a tiered stage means you use your imagination more than I had hoped. Finally, the ending number may have an amazing message to convey and does so well for mopping up the remains of the story, but it pales in comparison to the final numbers you usually see. Blasphemy I know, but after all the poetic majesty, after all the dynamic interactions, the last number I felt should have had pulled all the stops out to finish it strong.<br/><br/>The VERDICT:<br/><br/>I've rambled long enough so let's wrap this up for those looking for a quick summary. Hamilton is certainly an impressive display of creativity, wit, and entertainment that proves that you can find some great balance if you do your research and work. All the numbers hold such heart and fire, that the rap genre is perfect for helping maximize the wonderful messages I think Hamilton's life makes for. Amazing displays of acting, dancing, and singing blend beautifully to make engaging characters, that though are not fully developed have the engaging qualities you will certainly enjoy. The wit and use of the limited I am a huge HamilFan and was so exited to see this I stayed up till 2 A.M. to watch it. Now having seen Hamilton for the first time I have one flaw that keeps it from being perfect. The GD sound mixing. There were multiple instances where the sound was muffled and I could barely hear what was being said. This happens a good bit mostly in the first act. I will definitely watch it again, but whoever mixed the sound was either working with what he was given or really didn't care. Maybe the early release put him on a time crunch. We'll never know, but it's still worth the watch.
