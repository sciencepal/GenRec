When it first started, the flash was an exciting new addition to the arrowverse, with its first season being exceptional. Viewers immediately fell in love with Grant Gustin's Barry Allen (AKA The Flash). The first season was amazing and enjoyable, and the story was very complex, yet felt smooth and even.<br/><br/>Well, how the mighty have fallen. Over the seasons, we see a decrease in quality. As the producers churn out more and more episodes, the drop in quality is apparent. This is especially so in Season 4, which is by far the worst season of the flash. The excitement has all but faded, as each episode repeats the same things over and over again, with the plot being extremely predictable. <br/><br/>It is my hope that the main villain was given more time and that the number of episodes could be decreased, to reduce the number of filler episodes and to end up with a more concise story, that is better told. My wife and I were avid watches from seasons 1 through to 3, then season 4 happened.. it's like the writers wanted us to pay for being loyal by giving iris a bigger role than Barry's.. she is spoilt, annoying, nagging, controlling, countless unreasonable hissy fits, if my boss acted like her, id quickly tell her to shove her job where the Sun don't shine, i just don't think i could afford so many Panadol tablets to get thru every shift of having to deal with that... this show quickly went from being 'the flash' to the 'the Flash's wife', even giving her flash Powers.. her character is extremely annoying and really ruins the feel for the show.. we no longer watch as found it really cringeworthy... And my wife loves chick flicks so this is huge lol ...
You need to get rid of her character, like kill her off, or have her quit the team... Like seriously, most reviews on here seem to be saying the same thing as me so pull your socks up and fix this pile of garbage to be as good as it was before you ruined it (first 3 seasons)... The show was really good until they sacrificed H.R Wells for Iris (season 3). I personally preferred Patty Spivot, Barry and Patty had the best chemistry and I really liked her.
And show is getting worse by episode as it contains so much cliches and that annoying thing called IRIS.<br/><br/>So please kill Iris and make that some kind of plot twist or great setback for the team, that won't hurt the viewers i promise. If you had asked me a couple of years ago what the best super hero TV show at the time was, I would have said The Flash.<br/><br/>The show started excellently well with a gripping pilot and a good story line. It starts with how Barry Allen becomes The Flash starting with how he gets his powers, then learns how to use/control them and then tries to solve the mystery of his mother's death to avenge his father. Overall season 1 was superb! Season 2 was weak when it comes to the story line but the excitement of seeing new metas, cross over episodes and 'team flash' developing some individual abilities of their own makes watching the season worthwhile.<br/><br/>Season 3 has been average at best and my rating of flash that started from a full 10 has dropped to 7 over two years. Constant time traveling and meddling with things not only gets confusing in my opinion, but also makes you lose interest.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend people to give this show a go (especially if you are a DC fan) but the eventual and constant decline of the show is pretty obvious as you go on with the episodes. This show had a way higher rating from me a few years ago. Now I dropped it to 4 stars. Why?<br/><br/>Well it started of really good;
<ul><li>A little bit of an insecure Barry learning and training more and more how to use the speedforce.</li><li>Even though his powers are a LOT weaker than in the comics, it still was a joy to see the guy grow and learn more about his abilities</li><li>A cast that was supporting him (even tho each cw show HAS to have a full team behind the Superhero which takes away from the hero imo)</li><li>The main focus was on Barry</li><li>The main villain up till Zoom had a build up of anticipation and character development</li></ul><br/><br/>And Now?!
<ul><li>of course the infamous line; " NO! WE are the flash!" (should've been foreshadowing of what to come)</li><li>Barry stopped growing, on the contrary it feels as if his powers are dropping because he alway needs the help of other (more) incompetent people to finish the job</li><li>Whines a lot and needs a peptalk every other scene</li><li>Gets less and LESS screen time, I mean last episode (s06e12) was about 41 minutes long, he was in it for about 5 to 7 minutes!!??</li><li>The shows constant need to show that Flash isn't the superhero BUT the whole team is.... (especially Iris, egghhhh)</li><li>The cast REALLY feels bloated now and it really feels like they have to follow a checklist to have a more... 'complete' cast, which takes away from the story andddd the protagonist!</li><li>Starting to feel like a cheap soap opera about feelings and relationships and all that nonsense (just like what happend with Arrow; It's all about Felicity...)</li></ul><br/><br/>They really should either change the script or call it "Team Flash and sometimes featuring The Flash", but if the show doesn't change quick I'll have to accept it and consider it dead just like Arrow after season 3. Remove iris, remove season with devoid, and introducing meta tech was dumb, first few seasons deserves a 9 rating but after that this show deserves to be cancelled I really liked the first three seasons but since season 4, the show really changed. Season 6 is probably the worst. They have added so many characters that we don't even get to see Barry Allen as the Flash anymore. The last seasons have focused so much on Iris that I started hating the show!
P.S. I apologise for bad english, It's not my native language 1st season was really good , with great story. And slowly started to loose pace in the upcoming season . And the "Iris"character is very annoying , the effects were good, Sometimes the jokes are very silly and are very immature, the series are Good for kids under ten , but very silly and immature for teens and adults. So everyone knows that Iris west is the "lovable voice of reason." But that's utter bs! She doesn't know how to keep her mouth shut "oh my dads lying." Or "oh no my foster step brother is lying" she never really acts her age and those traits carried on to her daughter, nora the 30 year old teenager. Now both of them are complaining about fixable bs! The first couple of seasons were great. Then the CW does what they do best, ruin shows with P.C. crap.<br/><br/>The Flash isn't the Flash anymore. It's now the Iris show. Flash is on screen for small amount of time while Iris runs around in the starring role.<br/><br/>Thanks for ruining the Flash CW. I'm done and hopefully this show is canceled soon. This use to be my favorite show. It was really compelling early on, but went downhill after about season 3. I see other people's complaints are mainly about Iris. I do see what they say and agree to an extent - this show has quickly evolved into some weird comic book soap opera. The relationships have become really childish. The script sometimes feels like it was written by a team of 15 year old girls. I'd say my biggest complaint, is how stupid its become. The logic has become mind numbingly dumb. Soooo many plot holes. Sooo many inconsistencies. In one episode, called "Flash Time", all the Flashes are running near the speed of light. Then, in other episodes, Flash slips on some marbles and goes "Darn it, the bad guy got away because I fell down. There is no way I'd be able to catch up with them now!" I've forgiven them alot over the years for using dumb logic in their plot devices, in all their episodes , but its become way too much. The writers don't even care anymore about making sense. They've relegated this show to pure stupidity. The crisis crossover has been the dumbest thing I've seen on TV. I mean seriously, in 1 scene, Barry must run on the treadmill to save the multiverse. I use to watch all the arrowverse shows, but I've dropped all of them but Flash, but soon I will be dropping flash. It's obvious their target demographic for this show are 10 yr old girls. It's become 90% relationships 5% dumb logic 5% flash stuff... I mean really, CW, if you're going to make a comic show, why not make it primarily for the folks who watch this stuff? Why target 10 yr old girls? I know people want to hate on Iris, but I'd say she is 10% of the problem. The writers and the showrunner is the main problem. First 3 seasons of the show was great but now it's starting to get boring and unbearable to watch with Iris calling herself the leader of Team Flash.<br/><br/>Caitlin would make a better leader, if they really wanted one.<br/><br/>The show lost it after season 3. The plot of every season (after season 3):
1) Iris is nagging and acts as the boss's wife role commands
2) Villain appears and beats the crap out of Flash
3) Iris is worried and nagging
4) Barry tries to calm her down but it is still the beginning of the season so he fails
5) Somewhere in the middle of the season the rest of the crew are making they're appears as 50 year old teenagers.
6) Iris is still nagging and is in danger now
7) Barry calms her down and she says that she believes in THEM since THEY are the Flash.
8) Half of the last episode team flash (without Iris but she takes credit) manage to defeat the villain using team spirit and love. The other half of the season finale is boring celebration but at least Iris stopped nagging.<br/><br/>Next season:
Go to 1<br/><br/>THIS IS WHY YOU GIVE THE HERO THE LOVE OF HIS LIFE JUST BEFORE THE SHOW ENDS, TO AVOID THE 85% OF CRAP AND NAGGING!!! You make this series worse every day. We are bored with the absurdities of Iris and Iris. Barry's doing nothing but hanging around and beating. Grant Gustin is an excellent actor, but I don't want to follow the series anymore. What I want to see is the flash and flash team. Iris should be separated from the series because it reduces quality. The show has gone downhill since Nora joined the cast. She is not a likeable character and is immature and childish. I really like this show. Its goofy, fun and has some decent villains. I like all the characters, even Iris. But this season has brought in a new character who is ruining the show. The Flash's and Iris's daughter has shown up from the future. I know the acting isn't always the best in this show, but she has taken it to a whole new crappy level. She is irritating, and always has a pouty face. Its literally her only range of emotion she has. Her storyline is lame and again she is the WORST actor. Please........... get rid of her asap. I am really close to stopping watching this show, which is too bad because I've been watching from day one. Warning: People who think this is the greatest show they have ever seen, please do not read this because either you are too dumb (yes believe it, it's true) OR they don't know what great shows are like.<br/><br/>From being a fairly enjoyable show, it has gone to become a very boring, monotonous and irritating show. Post season 2, it becomes so dull that a viewer can actually predict what is going to happen in the end of the episode. The episodes, apart from following the main story line, follows the same track - in EACH ONE OF THEM! I am writing this review after pausing in the middle of the latest episode, which tells a lot about its quality I guess.<br/><br/>Okay, so the characters downgrades episode to episode. They start irritating you. The characters and dialogues makes you feel as if you are seeing so much sweetness that it's making you want to throw up. And the viewer starts to pissed off for the fact thinking that why the hell these characters have to always talk about their 'feelings' which get hurt over such stupid little things that one feels like giving them a good thrashing. All that uninteresting, monotonous emotional drama makes it so whimsical that it actually makes the viewer think "Whining bit**es" about the characters. Which makes a person wonder that after so many fights and dealing with losses, why are these dolts (the characters) still stupid and have not become more matured. Which reminds me - why are they not killing or sending that stupid Ralph (Plastic man) away and why the hell they keep bringing that Wells guy back in every season in some new form!<br/><br/>The science they use and the scientific explanations they give are just so damn ridiculous and extremely stupid that it makes you wonder that whether they are some Arts Grads posing as scientists, making stuff up as they go! I mean - Extracting powers and treating and changing the DNA with a liquid in a test tube! Do they even know what the DNA is! By the way who the hell pays for that Star Labs - for the surplus amount of electricity they are using along with all the costs that are or could be incurred by such a huge establishment in size? RIDICULOUS! Idiotic!<br/><br/>There is nothing different in the episodes and the characters starts to become so irritating - (I don't know how to describe it in any better way) promoting Modernism so much so that the viewer starts to wonder that in which part of the world people are like that and then thanks his luck that he does not live in that part of the world. It makes the characters look shallow and overly superficial in subtle ways (sometimes not even subtle!). I can go on and on, there are just so many flaws!<br/><br/>I'd recommend to watch Daredevil series or the Punisher series on Netflix which are so splendidly made (well compared to this crap). I am saying this though I am a DC comics fan! This show has become Absolutely disappointing! This used to be a great show for the first 3 seasons. I barely made it through season 4 before I dropped the show completely.
Iris fills no role other than being an annoying, useless control freak.
So do the right thing CW and kill her. Don't bring her back through some wibbily wobbly timey wimey...stuff.
Just kill her and deliver us from her. It's very annoying watching her in every episode and guess what the show is given her a more leading role than Barry. If you want to use a relatively real world with real science at least get the science right,,, Teaching people wrong science about real science is detrimental to everyone. Also the characters are all weak and pathetic, really disappointing people, and pretty much just complain about everything and feel down about life. Pathetic. I used to love watching this show but the last couple of seasons have been absolute rubbish. The story lines just drag on forever and sometimes they even send me to sleep. The only reason I have persevered this long is incase there is a cross over episode but now that Arrow has finished I think I will call it quits. I think it's time to put Barry Allen to rest also - I'm going to. I am so tired of the lame writing in this show. I can tell these writers are not committed to the plot and development of a true SUPER HERO. Smallville suffered from the same horrible writing. It isn't hard to write for such epic superheroes. The corny dialogue and the weak plots need to stop...PLEASE STOP The show was cool at the beginning Harry Caitlin and Cisco carried the show. meanwhile the relation between Barry and Iris destroyed it. Iris is just selfish stupid girl and Barry felt more of an idiot than a Hero. and Tom Cavanagh - Harry- was great being the maestro. to make Iris lead the flash team was just nail in the coffin. I I literally felt my IQ EQ dropping. I watched the 4th and 5th seasons like flash watched tv shows he missed after coming back from speed force. Every episode Iris West goes on and on about how "Barry lied to me," "My father lied to me," "my boyfriend lied to me." Talk about a broken record. First she goes from being a waitress to magically getting a job as a top reporter. Then she spends the rest of her screen time accusing people of lying to her, then acting like a 10 year old by giving everyone the silent treatment. Her rants are always about, "I thought you loved me," "I thought you were my best friend." Unfortunately I know I am not the only person who just wants someone to put a bullet in her head and get that annoying character off the show. And why on earth would anyone want to date or live with that shrew? Her character adds nothing to any storyline. Get rid of her. It is otherwise a pretty good, albeit, a kind of childish show. This show is outright awful, the characters don't develop over time but swap identities often to fit whatever nonesense plot they have thrown together.<br/><br/>The episodes are shallow and pretty stupid, suspending disbelief for the sake of entertainment is one thing, but ceasing all brain activity to actually swallow this dross is another. It's a good show but every time she gets a main plot or even talks it just ruins it for me Story and script is a joke. Actors cant perform and production design is simple horrible.
On top of all of this you have to endure the over the top political correctness all time. I watched season 1 long back and was disappointed. I loved the science and the speed but the character Iris was irritating as hell. So I stopped watching The Flash. But then justice League happened. I wanted to watch The Flash again and I did. But then adding to Iris there was this teen like kid flash. The episodes keep pissing me off as it goes by. Hope they change the writers. When the show first came out it was exciting. Now, it has become so slow and boring that it's almost painful to watch. And what's up with this fake French accented scientist guy? The using the same actor to play different parts? What is that all about? Is there a shortage of actors? It has become more like a soap opera than a superhero show. The writers really need to do better hire new writers. And the love affair between Flash and his wife seems so misplaced. The constant little psychological emotional dilemmas and squabbles is not interesting at all. Flash needs to be Flash. And including Nora as the child from the future makes the whole thing seems so confusing as well as Nora having too many damn problems. Stop killing the show please. These women are pains. Nora is a big cry baby and Iris has been a pain since S1E1 This show really makes you wish to be able to go back into the mind of a little child. Unfortunately, if you have an IQ higher than that of a 6 year old or are not a complete idiot, you will witness the absolute murderfest of a character you may have held dear and loved all your life. <br/><br/>The writers absolutely POOP right on the most basic writing rules. They are write themselves into corners, then just go to cheap tools to erase it, only to write themselves into the next corner. <br/><br/>So it happens that the Flash is fast enough to vibrate through a gasoline truck, hell, he's even so fast, that he goes back in time! But... wait, there's a guy with some bees, and the Flash is powerless. Oh noes, a guy who has little toys that will follow you: Flash is powerless. A guy with a gun that shoots a ray of ice that travels slower than the water of a waterhose? Flash is powerless. Oh, did I say that the Flash can catch a bullet that is being shot at the back of his head, without turning around? Yeah, that is no problem. <br/><br/>But everything else is. So he relies on a team of specialists, who work in a high tech underground lab - that any enemy can penetrate, as long as they have a hand to open the door lol.<br/><br/>The acting: The actors really try as hard as they can to be worse than the writing, and they almost make it. But like when trying to act, they fail here too. Iris and her Dad have the range of glue stuck to glue, and everybody else does a really awful at it too. <br/><br/>There is NO consistency, no logic, no real drama (who EVER thought for one second, that Barry really is about to die? be honest!). The show is just one big assassination of one of DCs coolest and (normally) funniest characters. <br/><br/>I wish I could be at the intellectual level of a plant or gum under the table, cause then I could enjoy the series about one of my favorite characters. But anybody with a sliver of intelligent, won't be able to enjoy that trainwreck of a insult to sentient beings. <br/><br/>And this is the toned down version of my review. 4th season is a disaster.Only cause of that annoying Iris thing director,writers wants to dance around. I have seen till 6th season(16th episode) and I feel like I enjoyed lot Barry- Caitlyn moments than Barry- Iris. After 1st 2 season I skip every scene of Iris, the Iris character is so booring and ridiculous.
Iris doesn't deserve Barry, I think Caitlin is way ahead and she is most important character after Barry. I don't know what the writers are really thinking,
This show is now, the west family instead of the flash The flash must die, yes the show not Barry Allen... Rubbish! The series has become so childish and boring. Poor acting from all the new cast members. Nora - annoying as hell! Iris - don't get me started. Think the series needs to end now. The Show would be a lot better if they can kill or remover the most annoying character and yes i refer with the one they call leader team every body dislike her please make us a big favor end remove IRIS WEST from this great show. i would give 10 stars if no IRIS WEST!!!!!! Why is Norah Allen still in this season? She came from future and changing the time line . Its so stupid of her. Its geting worse now the story. She should go back to where she came from. Its too annoying seeing her. This is my first time writing a review, but that's just how irritating this show was for me, one word to describe this show is cliché. First of all the show is so repetitive, the villain makes a first appearance and the flash with all his speed and abilities has to lose to the villain at first and then go prepare himself in star labs then he beats the villain in a rather disappointing showdown, excuse me but İ find it illogical that the flash would stop right before catching a shapeshifter just to tell him "You cant outrun me" resulting in his escape, really ? what a cliché. And yes the inconsistency of the flash's powers why isn't he able to avoid getting punched ? or speed his way out of a group of bees ? or avoid getting hit by a freezing/fire throwing gun ? it's just lazy on the writers' side to not try and find real challenges to his abilities instead of just contradicting the powers he shows in other unnecessary aspects of his life. Show is also full of plot holes, star labs is the place where everything about barry's identity is kept secret yet people just keep barging in on them like iris confirming the flash's identity, also how eddie keeping barry's identity a secret is affecting his relationship with iris is beyond me it's like they're begging for something to fill the episodes with, not to mention the corny dialogue. Also if cisco put his mind to it he can cure cancer. Iris is show spoiler, I gave 10 rating when I saw 1st season but it doesn't deserve even 5 rating after seeing season 4. Please kill the Iris character and get back on track. The quality of the show degraded over time to the point that it became so boring. Iris
isn't fit for her role and she's so irritating. I generally love the flash (the super hero)<br/><br/>But Everytime I watch the show I feel like my intelligence is being insulted because there's just so many plot holes, so much so that the plot is like a sieve where nonsense passes and logic is restricted.<br/><br/>I stopped watching it after ELSE WORLDS.. the dumbest, most stupid, lamest, Senseless, illogical and insulting crossover in th history of crossovers Started just like Arrow! Superhero, tough, but now chick flick and the men are women and the woman are men! "My name is Barry Allen and I am the fastest man alive" - But every other speedster on the show is 100000000 times faster than this piece of poorly written and played character(even the new speedsters who just got their speed). "I hunted down the man who killed my mother" - No duh you did. He didn't even remotely hunt him down, it's actually the opposite way around and in the end it was not even him who defeated the reverse flash. It was because of eddie the reverse flash was defeated. And Gaaaawwwddddd !! The actor is terrible.He always talks as if he's got a tampon size ice cube up his arse. Not to mention the writing of the show is so cringeworthy, the flash heavily depends on other character's advice to use his powers. The flash himself is an intelligent personality who can figure counter measures on his own. Remember with his ability to run faster came the ability to think faster and better.<br/><br/>This show gets pretty REPETITIVE. A new villain shows up in an episode -> Flash shows up -> Gets beating -> Runs like a pussy -> Takes advice from his friends -> They come up with some lame and pretty basic advice -> Flash returns to villain with his new "move" and you know how it goes. What is this ? Power rangers ? This series is not even remotely close to the comic version of flash. Just a bunch of immature people getting together to destroy a good comic character. For the people who are watching Flash for the first time- Please do not judge flash's powers based on this series. This is an utter disaster and the Flash is not as dumb or whiny as they depict him in this show. God iris is SOOOOO ANNOYING!! starting season 2.5 Please kill her off at the very least she needs off the team boooo worst part of the show! It's time to change the name of the show its not the FLASH anymore its "the flash and his friends mostly" Pushing too much drama into a super hero story and ruining everything. To make it interesting to some stupid people or the director himself, characters start behaving awkwardly in respect to their personality. And, what is up with Iris thing? She became a super smart bad ass from a news reporter now? I wish she was killed by Savitar and there was less drama. Director is pushing drama everywhere, and most of them are not needed. It has become an idiotic series. Now on the 8th episode of season 4, what the hell happened from last episode? Why the hell do you need to bring homosexuality to it in one single episode? No offense on homosexuality but is all these really needed on those scenes? Just injecting these like injecting Barry and Iris marriage plan drama and Joe becoming father drama, and even sometimes Wells singing and dancing drama and everyone is joining? What the hell is this? 1977 family drama series or 2017 super hero one? WAKE UP!
I had given it 9 star rating till season 3.. after watching these episodes of season 4 I can give it more than 4. WATCHING THIS IS A WASTE OF TIME ! I suppose there's no reason the series should annoy me less than the comics always have. "The fastest man alive". That means no lesser being, short of another speedster can touch or damage him. Even a telepath or telekinetic is limited by how fast their brain works. It's established that the Flash can stretch a nuclear explosion into a multi-hour event. Then in subsequent episodes, he's rendered unconscious by something launched at a speed a talented human could aviod.<br/><br/>I understand the difficulty of providing a narrative challenge to a godlike character. Can you at least hire writers who read comics and have a little imagination? Absolute garbage. 6th season digs a 6 feet grave and dumps science in it. Seriously a room sized black hole in the first episode and it barely pulls a human close to it. A black hole with the mass of the sun will be the size of a football. If ever a room sized black hole were to appear in the open ( Like it did in the premiere episode), it would pull in the entire solar system and nearby stars. This show is getting more and more pathetic and dumb people with no knowledge may enjoy it. Loved this series till season 3, which is just plain farce.<br/><br/>Since Barry came back, the first three episodes have been shockingly awful.<br/><br/>Have the writers run out of ideas and resorted to plain old cheap laughs, no right, it ain't funny! Run out of money maybe?<br/><br/>I know Flash has always been lighter in theme than the other of the Marvel stable. However, season three, so far has been terribly bad. Gone are the days of glory ! Used to be an avid fan of the series esp during S1 and S2. the series was a regular on the watchlist every week. But the series has gone a very sad path. It is more of a daily soap opera with a limited time devoted to the main character and the OTF. Hopefully the creators can turn the tide soon otherwise there'll be nothing left to watch on this show. First season is great. Second season is awesome... but that's it. I don't know what happened but they keep trying to be funny. Spoiler alert THIS IS NOT FUNNY ! This sucks, and really boring, i hate how they eneded flashpoint, and just the overall iris character, and her stupid saying like "barry dont try to fight alone were a team i can write news" Never felt the need to review a show before, but this is infuriating. The Flash, Arrow, Legends...need to stop splicing episodes across franchises. There is nothing more infuriating than not being able to watch the entirety of a story. It is pretty unlikely the platform your watching it off is going to have all your godam franchises. Knock it off already!!! Maybe CW has taken it upon itself to ruin a great character from the DC Universe!!! Probably a child who has never been exposed to genres of movies which never make people think would enjoy this. A show full of stupid plot holes and unnecessary nagging in the form of emotions.... Worthless emotions are given importance rather than good character building and meaningful backstories. Literally the viewership would spike if they kill off stupid emotions and IRIS WEST and bring in some meaningful story!!!!!! I had high hopes but as the seasons progressed, it gets worse. It feels like a budget soap opera with cheap CGI and bad acting. Like, painfully over-the-top bad. Cringeworthy acting with terrible dialogue that wouldn't be out of place on Disney Channel.<br/><br/>I'll get my Flash fix elsewhere. Stupid annoying sidekicks who do nothing other than give each other pep talks. truly lame and awfully. First 2 seasons of the show were great, even the one with Savitar was good enough. But then all of a sudden Iris became the leader and kept getting more and more screen time that the show has become The Iris, not The Flash. She has made the show irritating to watch, sometimes Iris character acts too dumb to tolerate and in every episode at least 3 pep talks or inspirational speeches! People expect to see about The Flash, not a family drama about West-Allen Family. It's high time to get rid of these much screen time for dumb characters like Iris or Nora. It's clear that writers are out of ideas and the story has become repetitive, dull. I used to love this show. Yes, there were a few dumb scripts and scenes, but overall, it was good. I liked all the characters and everything about the show. However, season 6 was absolutely horrible. I couldn't get through the first episode of that season. This show is a good example as to why it can be a good thing to quit while you're ahead. The producers make the same plot with the same result over and over again. There is only so many times that you can do that without the show getting boring. It was good before. The first seasons were amazing, I was totally into this show, but with the last seasons I am more and more dissapointed. I keep watching because I'm the kind of person who want to see till the end and to be onest, I want to end once and for all because is everything about Iris. I hoped you could do best, but all I saw was bad.. At least give a good ending. 1) get rid of IRIS she is doing nothing literally nothing
2)And please stop making episode more emotions for example in each and every episode everybody is just crying. this not heart broken movie its a flash.
3) Flash stop blaming your self each and every time it happens because of me bla bla bla and stop crying.
4) make some interesting episode Get rid of Nora & this ridiculous Cicada/Grace character. They have done nothing for this show but drag it down. Such shallow characters! No substance. I don't want to stop watching but this is not making me excited about next season at ALL. I have been a huge fan of this series and really loved it for first two seasons.But now they are losing there track and I don't know why they are so much focused on Joe's family.He found his wife, got his son, he is dating Cecile and now is going have a baby.Sometimes it feels like the Joe is the main character and all story revolves around him.<br/><br/>The other character that gets on my nerve is Iris.In this season she irritates me every time she comes on screen.I mean why is getting so much importance and what is she doing in the star labs? A how dare she say "we are the flash" , even Cisco, Caitlin or Harrison Wells hasn't said something like that.I sometimes wish that Savitar should have killed her.<br/><br/>They are like always having a speedster villain and the show is getting way too lighter.It looks like they are not having a speedster villain this season and I hope the show improves. Sry for my English - i am from Germany!<br/><br/>I'm still watching this sh..t, just because i like the flash and there are some good animations where he moves fast. I don't have anything against the actors -still they upset me sometimes with the artificial drama. The most annoying is the story - the logical things. They try to force so much science into the episodes but they violate the basic laws of physics at the same time.<br/><br/>For example: Why must flash punch the giant gorilla with his hand??? Pick a f...g steel bar, speed up to mach-8 and punch the gorilla with the steel bar - that would be clever! Punching the gorilla with the hand on mach-8 is just stupid and you risk damage to the hand, nobody would do that - and you can apply this example to every episode!<br/><br/>Then there is "Mr. Cold" or whatever he is called. He is not even a real enemy to the flash. He cant do sh..t against flash with his canon. And why does flash have to run into the ice-cannon and fire-cannon at the same time to defeat the villains? Again do the same trick with the steel bar (like with the gorilla) and there would never be a problem.<br/><br/>There is something the writers and directors need to understand: The flash is so fast that it is difficult to find a real enemy for him. Still this is the challenge - to find a villain who beats flash with speed or with his cleverness - the reversed flash was a nice try (with his dead again not being logical).<br/><br/>No creativity, no logic - just stupid scripts. When I was a lad back in the 60s my favourite super heroes were The Flash and Green Lantern. I'll discuss the horror that was the recent Green Lantern movie in that thread.<br/><br/>I was really looking forward to the 2014 version of The Flash. While John Wesley Shipp made a great Flash back in 1990, the writers just had to inject the usual cornball humour that ruined the show for me. The 2014 Flash suffers from a different problem. The writers assume that the viewers are morons. Two examples follow:<br/><br/>In one episode, Flash fights an opponent who can turn to steel. He defeats him with a risky move that requires him to run at supersonic speed, then enter a building and punch the villain. If the theory is wrong The Flash dies. Here's an idea. How about using the same speed to launch something like a brick at him? In either case, though, how does one stop in the length of a high school corridor when one is traveling at supersonic speed?<br/><br/>But the biggest problem is that the writers continue to ignore the fact that The Flash can run really really fast. That's kind of the whole basis of the series. Check out the episode where he is up against Captain Cold and Heat Wave. The two villains are in the middle of the street and the only way he can defeat them is to get hit by both guns at the same time? We just saw Barry serve coffee to a room full of customers without being detected (because he can run really really fast - get it?). Here's an idea. Run really really fast and take their guns away before they can fire them.<br/><br/>Then there's the other option. As my son and I watched the show we repeatedly turned to each other and said the single word, "sniper". Somehow all those police just overlooked the fact that they carry guns and neither of the villains was wearing a bullet proof vest. And even if they were. Head shot! Duh! <br/><br/>So I am tired of being treated like a moron. I think I'll be passing on future episodes. Pity. Get rid of that character from the TV series..read the comics ;) This is more of a soap opera than a superhero show. The CGI is cheap, the action scenes unconvincing and the overall storyline mediocre and uninspired. It is targeted at a teenage audience that will eat anything up as long as there are enough love interests for the protagonist. I have been quite happy with the Flash until I saw season 2 Episode 18. The writing in that episode is beyond stupidity. Why?<br/><br/><ul><li>All portals to the other earth were closed. Zoom is fatally sick. In a few years he would die by himself. No real reason to open portal to other earth.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Barry is faster than Zoom. Barry captures Zoom but does not knock him out or anything. Instead Barry just talks to Zoom and fails to keep him captured. Also the trap they made for Zoom is stupid. Barry already is faster than Zoom so there was no need for a trap.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>When Zoom handed over Wally to the Flash team, why didn't Barry just break the deal and kill him or at least knock him out and capture him?. Instead Barry makes the most retarded decision he has ever made. He gives his powers to the serial killer Zoom, who could kill everyone in the earth especially when there is no one to stop him (the Flash is the only one who could stop him).</li></ul><br/><br/>So Barry risks both earths for no good reason. Was he afraid to fight Zoom? Who knows. I hope they don't make this kind of writing mistakes in the future or the Flash is over for me. The show keeps getting worse with time , everything about it, do not waste your time Many years ago I binged all of season 1, cried a bit, and absolutely loved it.<br/><br/>Continued watching season 2 on a pirate website, had a good time, but felt it was getting repetitive and the ending felt out of character a bit after all he's learned, but it also had a lot of promise.<br/><br/>Season 3 is where I lost interest. The effect of season 2 lasted an episode, there are some lasting effects. Kinda weak in my opinion. Villains a very predictable. Continuity is lacking. Flash gets slower as the series goes on, he can't catch a motorcycle. Needless drama. Problems are solved after a single one on one conversation. The biggest fault is that the show thought we cared about characters no one in the right mind would care for.<br/><br/>I tried watching season 4, but it resorted to the same, repetitive tropes as before. Had to stop watching, and from what I've heard, the show hasn't gotten any better. I watched this because of justice League movie, so i know Flash's character. In the beginning i like this TV show. continue to watch until I stop watching at season 2 ep 20. Can't stand of its stupidity. omg.. how can the storyline become so dumb. the story was forced so there is a villain for our hero. got mad every time during the movie, so better not watch it again. first time to watch superhero this weak and stupid Might contain spoilers yet it is hard to spoil the show that spoiled.<br/><br/>Badly guided meat puppets randomly spewing out for no apparent reason phrases like "I promise", "It's not gonna happen", "It's my fault", "I promise", "It's not gonna happen, I promise" etc., horribly written by the "writers" who probably learned to write in a clown school, where they teach you how to annoy people off to no end instead of weaving beautiful story lines. And at some point one really starts to hope for mass murder suicide of the whole bunch of main characters and writers. Started by the emotionally unstable namesake of the show with his trembling and cracking voice of the person on the brink of hysteria and mental breakdown. +1 just for beautiful production of the set. PS: I have a bit of OCD concerning shows I started to watch, even awful ones. So this is my outlet for all the pain and suffering brought to me by 3 seasons of this one. The spoilers here are very minor and will not affect your experience if  you're the average person. Still, better safe than sorry.  WRITING (Conflicts, character actions, and dialogue)  The writing in this show is less than impressive. There is no such  thing as subtlety and half the dialogue is them throwing in the word  "fast" for the hell of it. At one point, a character says to some  random thug "Freeze! Now, get on the ground or do you wanna find out  the hard way that you're not faster than a bullet?" I'm actually quite  certain that the line verbatim is worse than that.  A lot of plot points make no sense, and this is a huge problem with The  Flash in general. The Flash is so fast that few conflicts are actually  conflicts for The Flash, but rather than being creative and trying to  think up interesting conflicts, they make the characters mentally  incompetent to the point that The Flash, who can dodge a bullet, cannot  dodge a punch. This actually becomes the main plot point of an entire  episode. His inability to dodge attacks at normal speed makes no sense.  Also, he has a tendency to block bullets that he doesn't even know are  there. In one episode, he reaches behind him and pinches a random spot  behind his neck and there just happens to be a bullet there for him to  block! What an ESSENTIALLY IMPOSSIBLE COINCIDENCE! That is the laziest  writing ever. "We need our character to get shot at without getting  shot. Let's just have him randomly reach back for some reason, I'm sure  we'll figure it out in post."  There's an episode where he has to catch three motorcyclists. So, he  runs to each of them, takes them to a police station and handcuffs them  to a pole like he always does.  I'm just kidding, he creates roadblocks where he thinks they'll go so  that he can make all the motorcyclists go towards each other, and then  they won't know how to move past each other, so they'll stop and the  police can get them, at which point there will be an utterance of  "Checkmate." That last bit is also not a joke. That happened. This is  actually something that a producer and a team of writers looked over  and said "Nothing wrong here. Onwards to production!"  Also, this is My Little Pony with adults watching (so, just My Little  Pony...with Rainbow Dash as the main character, I suppose). They like  to have Aesops to each episode, and they're very basic moral lessons,  or even broken ones, and then they'll do what's essentially a Dear  Celestia inner monologue at the end of each episode. "Today, I  learned..." Really? There's no subtlety in the character development at  all. At certain points, I swear the characters literally look at the  camera and go "I've really changed today. I used to think A and now I  think B."  Here's a bit of dialogue meant to be badass.  (Right before Barry's about to leave.) "Barry." (Barry stops to see why  his peer decided to stop him during this urgent mission.) "Yes?" "Run."  CONSISTENCY  There is no consistency with Barry's powers. The effects of running  really fast (friction, air compression, etc.) turn on and off randomly.  At one point, a woman's shirt burns off despite that making no sense  whatsoever, presumably because one of the writers thought that the  actress was hot and knew he had the power to get her to reveal a little  more.  As I mentioned before, he just decides not to dodge punches. Or grab  people's weapons to disarm them. He also runs slow enough for The Arrow  to see him and aim at him when he's fast enough to see bullets. Bullets  are so fast that 500 feet away, all you can do is blink before the  bullet reaches you. Otherwise, you're completely still. Everything  should be frozen for Barry, but he runs at the speed of a falcon from  time to time.  TECHNICALITIES  Bullets and guns. Don't expect them to make sense. Physics. Chemistry.  Science in general. Tensile strength being a huge factor when hitting  someone? Hearing a sonic boom from something that hasn't gotten to you  yet? A gun that creates the heat of the Big Bang? A needle the heat of  the Sun would kill everyone in at least a one thousand mile radius. A  warehouse the heat of all the energy in the universe (which, you might  notice, doesn't make sense) would evaporate all matter in the entire  solar system. But no worries here, just some second degree burns (these  were normal humans that got second degree burns, not The Flash, so no  superpowers to withstand the energy of the entire universe there). 500  proof alcohol? Iron oxide being uncommon?  Turn your brain off or get a hemorrhage. It's nice to see The Flash  moving about with live actors (though poor actors), but that's it.  That's the only pro. That's all this show gets. Season 1 was awesome. Season 2 was great. Especially with that flashpoint. I was eager waiting to see that to happen in season 3. Then, omg, it only lasted for 1 episode? And... omg, it got worse and worse and boring and trash and i dont know.
The flashpoint should be a great reboot for the series as well as Arrow since it's in the same universe and also getting worse after season 3. Ya, i dunno. I sort of liked the first season of the flash. Its goofy, fun, entertaining, and its a happy nice show. The acting is not always good, the script pretty crappy, and nothing makes sense and I do not like the Caitlin and Cisco characters and there are plenty more to complain about in the first season, but just enjoy the ride and do not overthink it and the first season is worth a watch. Season 1 is perhaps a 5. <br/><br/>The second season however crashes completely. And the first couple of episodes of the 3rd season is beyond bad, so horrific that we need to invent new words. <br/><br/>The second is a 1 at best, and the third -10. Never seen a TV-show crash so much from season to season to season before. Personally I would rather put a nail in my eye then watch the Flash. I cannot find a single redeeming quality of the show. Everything which was bad in the first season is much worse in the second season, and in the third they even have Flash murder his own mother because he does not want to be happy! Seriously! A "hero" let the villain kills his mum because.. well, no one knows. And the few good fun goofy stuff from the first season which made it watchable is completely gone. <br/><br/>In total this is for kids around 8y old, but even they will have a hard time believing what is going on. And I do not mean that in superhero-y way, I mean that nothing makes sense. At all. They change the power of Barry all the time, there are speedsters in every single corner and the acting is so terrible even I could do better. <br/><br/>Please do not watch this horrible, terrible, agonizingly bad show. It is almost as bad as Gotham... brr....<br/><br/>And for the fan boys who state they love this crap; if you do not complain about a horrible show then all we will get is a horrible show. In my opinion, this show started great with a surprising first season, but as the second season came along is like the show- runners and script writers ran out of ideas and started doing random stuff that made no sense whatsoever. The second season had way too many plot holes and continuity errors. Too many things made no sense whatsoever and many other things were left completely unexplained. It was almost as if the both the show- runners and the script writers were changed halfway through the season and they had no idea what was going on with the show. I won't get too much into detail but an example of this was the Zoom almost killing "Jay Garrick" flashback at the beginning of the season. Technically, with what happened later on the show, that NEVER happened since it was all made up by zoom, so why show a flashback to an event that never happened?! A second example was when Zoom killed his Jay Garrick self in front of the team. He arrived with the body at his lair and said "Well, this is a complication" but then like 3 episodes later supposedly it was all part of his plan all along and his Jay Garrick self agreed to being killed. So why, if it was all part of his plan all along and his other self agreed to being killed, why was it a complication? The season already ended and this was never explained. These two things I just mentioned were left completely unexplained and it caused continuity errors with things that happened later that SAME season. They create quite the plot holes as well. But these are just two of perhaps the 10 to 15 things that were left completely unexplained by that season. It is almost as if they just rushed through the script writing without revising it after they were done. They really didn't think things through with this season. Maybe the success of the first season got in their heads and they thought they could just make a bunch of random illogical stuff and people would like it.<br/><br/>Another thing is that the acting this season felt less natural, like they suddenly forgot how to act sometimes. It bugged me quite a lot, specially with Danielle Panabaker who, in my opinion, had the worst acting this season.This does not applies to Tom Cavanagh because he is actually a great actor.<br/><br/>So yeah, unfortunately, looking at how the second season played out, if in the third season they don't do something to fix all the errors they made in the second season then this show will get nowhere, and if they continue making more continuity errors and plot holes then this show will completely fail. To be fair, this show started quite great. It had a good plot, cast, likeable characters and repetitiveness was pretty much absent. However, the Flash doesn't have this consistency anymore.<br/><br/>Season 1 was amazing and without a doubt the greatest season of the show. Although it had its flaws, the plotline with Dr. Wells a.k.a Eobard Thawne was fairly interesting, the sub-villains were connected well to the story and the concept was overall quite fresh.<br/><br/>Season 2, in my opinion, turned out to be one of the last decent seasons for the Flash. I liked that the writers introduced us to a villain ("Zoom") that was faster than the Flash. The writers showed us that Barry wasn't invincible/invulnerable as the Flash and that he and his team were struggling to beat Zoom. Again, the sub-villains were connected to the story, (SPOILER) as they turned out to be working for Zoom.<br/><br/>Season 3 is where everything went downwards. It was interesting to see the aftermath of "Flashpoint", but that was about it for me. The writers decided to add a not-so-genius "Dr. Wells" from "Earth 19" and called him H.R. Wells. The character brought pretty much nothing to the story (apart from a couple of jokes) and therefore felt kind of forced. Not to mention the characters "Kid Flash" and "Jesse Wells". These two helped Barry at times, but then pretty much disappeared from the story.
Then there is the repetitiveness. The structure of the episodes was quite predictable and the plot of a character betraying Barry was used once again (Dr. Alchemy). We also get another speedster that is apparently faster than the Flash (Savitar).
Lastly, the relationships between the characters became cringy, awkward and annoying. In my opinion, there is a complete lack of chemistry between Iris and Barry making them a terrible couple.<br/><br/>The show definitely hit rock-bottom in season 4. The season's villain ("The Thinker") lacked invulnerability that other villains had. It felt like Barry was on the ground almost every episode, because "The Thinker" was ten steps ahead of him. This led to repetetiveness for me as the episode structure was pretty much like this:
<ul><li>Team Flash finds the location of the Thinker and tries to come up with a solution to outsmart him.</li><li>Barry finds the Thinker and tries to defeat him.</li><li>Barry fails to defeat him.</li></ul><br/><br/>Some other points I would like to adress are:
<ul><li>The episode where Iris is given Barry's speed ("Run, Iris, Run") is ridiculous and unnecessary as are the "Girls Night Out" and "Harry and the Harrisons" episodes. Iris brings nothing to Team Flash; she lacks experience and intelligence in the field and it brings me discomfort to see such a person lead the team. The "Girls Night Out" episode was mainly focused at the women of the Arrow-verse shows and didn't bring anything to the story. The "Council of Wells" in the "Harry and the Harrisons" episode didn't add anything as well. The Thinker didn't make any appearances in the episode and the "Council of Wells" tried to be entertaining, but instead left me with a feeling of awkwardness.</li><li>The typical cross-over with other Arrow-verse shows is pathetic this season. The storyline with the "Olicity" wedding being interrupted by Nazi's is ridiculous. I wonder what the writers were thinking while writing the script.</li><li>I also still don't get how "The Flash" has a higher rating on IMDb than "Arrow". I know that Arrow has had its weak times (season 4), but it still isn't as cringy and childish as The Flash is right now.</li></ul><br/><br/>In short, if you would like to watch The Flash for the first time, go ahead and watch the first two seasons. It is up to you if you'd like to continue watching after that, but don't say I didn't warn you... Cry about things - Make Mistake - Mess it up for everyone - Try to Fix it - Fix it - REPEAT I tried watching this but it's not good its cheesey. Season 1 and 2 were 10s! I love that Barry and team have a strong moral compass. the show is entertaining amd still ok for my grandkids. After Barry came out of the speedforce the show changed for the worse. And now instead of getting back on track you have added Nora. This character is annoying and I hate her on the show. why kill Harry? Why kill Killer Frost? wally?<br/><br/>you are ruining a great thing. The first season was OK, but then it appeared to go off on a loop, with endless boring repetitive stories, and nonsense featuring unlikely child 'geniuses'. An obsession with ticking all the PC boxes - as with so much stuff produced nowadays - degrades most films and series these days, resulting in boring and predictable 'plots'. The 'cross-over' episodes, no doubt intended as promotions for the other series, are terrible and make no sense. I wonder how old the writers of this rot are? Ten, twelve or what? They certainly seem an untalented lot. No wonder so many people are going back to older stuff and ignoring what is produced now.<br/><br/>Presumably the voting tally at the top (giving this rubbish an 8!) has been provided by vested interests. I really liked this show but after you fired Hartley I won't watch it anymore. 1. Time travel into the past - no, nada, no way, not possible; future yes, but you need a whole "s..t" load of energy, like carry several fusion nuclear power plants (p.s. and they don't exist on any scale) in your backpack.
2. Time portals - sounds cute, but if you survived the gravity (not possible) you would need an additional backpack.
3. Parallel Universe - a mathematical creation, but still another backpack.
4. Loads of cute sounding science sounding words tossed in that fail middle school science - tachyons (duh!); using dark matter energy (sounds ominous, but writers have no idea what they're talking about). Quantum tunnel compactor to turn dark matter energy into practical energy?? Help!
5. Can't figure out why they move their arms & legs like they're running. Besides stress on joints; wind resistance at an unimaginable scale, there's the problem of internal organs being tossed about as they turn, accelerate, stop, etc. I know, it's just dumbing down make believe.
6. Acting, dialogue consistent with cheap daytime soap TV. Special effects, the usual lit up energy force hands & colored CGI/contact lens energy eyes found in most sci-fi. This show has not jumped the shark, it has run past it at light speed. This season is just plain awful. The new characters are just not interesting at all and the Nora character is not even to the level of useless. Annoying, whiny, pitifully written, just like Iris in the first season with her incessant whining and moaning. I will be surprised if it is renewed for season six. It is like watching a six year old try to act as a 25 year old character. Nora has the emotional depth of a teaspoon and lo and behold, is on the show due to...wait for it..TIME TRAVEL!! AGAIN!!!. Has there been a season they have NOT used time travel? One word for the season 5- BORING.
Nothing special to see
Same characters and same stories so damn boring This serie was fantastic untill the end of the seoson 2 but seoson 3 4 5 are realy bad and the main reason is iris west im not speaking about the actress her act is good but the character is so anoying and every season have same story one main villain and other additionall villain if i want to recomend is good to see seaoson 1 and 2 and until episode 10 of seoson 3 after every Christmas the serie story fall again Yep. I watched the whole season hoping it would get better. I think there has to be some sort of mass psychosis going on in certain cultural corners of our society. It is the only way I can understand why anyone besides adolescents would enjoy Flash. It is a good thing there are grittier takes on the superhero genre out there like the new Daredevil. Flash is just teen drama with a side of ridiculous action. The inconsistencies of his powers were so blatantly abused just so that they could have some sort of physical challenge for him when in reality nothing should be a problem for him. Bees? He gets taken down by bees? Dumb. I just can't take this show seriously. In a nutshell, its bad. I'll keep watching because I'm that type of junkie. Sure it's entertaining however this is NOT quality entertainment. I value it only for its "comedic" value.<br/><br/>I'll start by cinematography and music. Both of which are important frames for the media being conveyed. In short it's stale and not innovative. <br/><br/>It's like a big blockbuster movie all brawn but no brains. If only it were just that bad. But no, action is only a segment in the show and instead a lot more weight is put on old, re-hashed and reused cliché drama (dead mother who we know next to nothing about despite her death being one of Barry's driving force, bullying, unoriginal superhero speeches, friend zone -heya Smallville- that just fizzles out despite the love interest being Barry's life long crush PLEASE & on & on & on)<br/><br/>Stein, Joe and maybe Wells are the only decent actors. Caitlyn and Cisco can work. But Barry ... not sure if just bad script or both are at fault but I'm unable to warm up to his character. Furthermore the storyline is transparent and predictable (psst Wells)It feels like they took the story from some second rate comic book with the run 'o the mill villain of the week without even bothering to polish the story up. (now i love superhero comics both DC/Marvel but only kinda Daredevil/Agents of SHIELD pulled the media transition off) <br/><br/>In summary if you're a consumer pig like me you'll keep watching. I guess audiences under 12-14 are having a blast but for a more mature audience the blunders are all to evident. I Loved this show at the beggining, but each season that passes gets worse and more fake, the connections between the caracters becomes more weak and the Powers of the metas becomes more and more bizarre.
However the show lost the essence, and Barry powers becomes nothing comparing with the powers of the others that can do literaly everything! At the beggining of the show the team flash actually had challenges, but now seem that they can do anything! Barry's should be special because of his powers that were Impossible, but now everyone in the show have Impossible Powers even have metas that can switch and take over the powers of each one!
Concluding... The show becomes exaggerated! Sorry for typos. My english is not so good<br/><br/>Months ago I stopped watching this series. Because Iris, of course. Iris is the most intolerable person in the series. The other actors and the characters they played were very important for the series and wanted to see more of them. But the filmmakers just wanted to see Iris. so I left this series and I will not watch until Iris comes out of the series. This series is a complete waste of time as long as Iris. Nothing in this show makes any sense.. This proves to me that American television is getting dumber and less creative by the month!<br/><br/>The kid wakes up after nine months of being in a coma and just walks out straight away, with a tan and perfect hair.<br/><br/>No one seems that impressed that he can run at the speed of light..<br/><br/>The lab which blew up the whole city is still operating and although they claim to have lost everything, they can still afford to run this highly technical facility.. Oh yeah.. and its run by a bunch of kids. It seems kids are doing everything in this show.. where are the adults? Are we supposed to believe these 20 year olds are running advanced scientific laboratories? <br/><br/>Actors look so dumb and out of place it makes me want to grab a cheese grater and slowly rub it over my face, causing me as much pain as humanly possible, only to distract myself from the fact that I just watched this show.<br/><br/>If you cannot see how cheesy and bad this is, you have become immune to the American junk that is all around us, I urge you to watch real television. PLEASE SAVE YOURSELF THE TORTURE! Remove iris and the bs forced diversity and you have a good show I loved this show, even if it was not faithful to the source material, I like Irish redheads but meh Americans have some kind of skin color fetish and they made a very beautiful Irish redhead in a black brunette, let's say this I was excited for the flash that I let that thing go as the actress looks decent and in the beginning she was quite bearable. So all in all I gave it a chance. <br/><br/>But boy was I wrong to give her a chance, she single handed managed to destroy the 3rd season and season 4 made me just skip watch all of it as she murdered The Flash and became We Flash, episode 5 was so freaking bad I think it hit the lowest score for all episodes overall and it was the an episode about Girls Night Out, with some feminist substrate and no Flash action whatsoever, is like watching a pron with no actual pron action. <br/><br/>Initially I gave this a 9 rating but now overall this show is at that point in time when I watch it less and less or even skip watch because the content is too annoying or boring. <br/><br/>The only thing to save this show is Iris West needs to die (not the actor she is just annoying by nature just like King Geoffrey) and the writers need to use the source material as there is plenty to use. My favourite character. 
I love the time travel and the speed force concept. I am expecting a lot from the upcoming seasons. Seriously, this show is so stupid and filled with too much drama. then it's gets repetitive along the way. avoid it. Cry, troll, and BADLY fail harder you embarrassingly pathetic, triggered loser incels X- ) This show starts out good and ends up being some teenage emo rollercoaster that's more caught up in their feelings and promises than with saving the city with a team of superheros. I enjoyed the first few seasons of this show, but then it's like the writers completely forgot that Flash is the main character. Instead, they give just about everyone super powers (even Iris is the Flash for an episode), introduce WAY too many characters, and let literally everyone in the city know that The Flash is Barry Allen. Whatever happened to the age of comics where a hero's identity is kept secret?? Apparently not in today's my-life-is-an-open-facebook-world! Furthermore, Iris is one of the most inconsistent, whiny, weak, and most terribly written characters in any Arrowverse show, to date! Her presence in any scene drags down literally every charater within a 10 foot radius with her inconsistent temperament and adolescent behavior. Forceably discussing kissing your fiancé with your father, really? Asking your fiancé to "give you space" and then having a meltdown when he moves out... really? Start counting how many scenes Iris storms off in, you can make a drinking game out of it! Also count how many times the characters say "I Promise" and you'll be drunk by the end of the episode. Sheesh. First 2 seasons good but after that show gets kinda boring and slow. Also the further the show goes on the worse the CGI gets especially after recently watching first episode of season 4. Like arrow the love story is soap opera material and the show was better when flash didn't have a super hero sidekicks team up. The writing for the show is poor standard. Like a lot of other TV shows I watch lately the show gets repetitive. I have quit watching arrow and now am getting pretty close to quitting this series. Firstly and most importantly this show is sooo bad because of the horrible acting , cliché dialogue and terrible writing . Why can't these superhero shows are given to writers and directors of shows like game of thrones , the wire , walking dead and shows like sopranos which has got such a bravo acting and story . I have seen that most of the Marvel's show are just crap only because of the terrible acting , dialogues and character . Now coming back to Flash , this show has one positive point and that is photography rest is just a garbage . And that character iris west , oh lord !!! can somebody just shut her up !! Even the lab geeks of STARS lab who has technology and help flash are soo terrible and the dialogues are so cliché and acting is just horrible and childish type , even the comedy punches are so horrible uughhhh..!!! This show is good for children in the age group 5-15 and for those who haven't seen any serial as mentioned above by me .There are so many logical errors in this show , i mean just take one for an example that the flash has got such a high speed and even though he just stand in front of a gun point and takes the beating . And shows speed at unnecessary places . I even watched 2-3 episodes of it believing that it will get better and acting might improve but its all in vane .8/10 rating of this show is only because of the superhero fan who have read all of the flash comics and now seeing it on TV for real . Barry Allen was introduced during "Arrow" season 2, which was the show in its prime. After setting him up in the universe, they went on to make a show based entirely around Barry Allen becoming The Flash. Since "Arrow" was getting darker and darker, "The Flash" went in the opposite direction. It's the tonal antithesis of "Arrow". Lighthearted, quirky, and silly, yet grounded enough to make us care, and the writing is just as sharp and witty as you'd hope.<br/><br/>When the characters were first introduced in the "Arrow" episode, I thought I would hate them in "The Flash". But after a few episodes, each character is developed with a certain role in the show, and it works wonders. Harrison Wells as the enigmatic mastermind behind STAR Labs, Caitlin as the straitlaced neurotic scientist, Cisco as the sarcastic pop-culture referencing comic relief who comes up with each villain's "super" name, and Barry Allen as the relatable everyman who was struck by lightning and became the fastest man alive. Then there's Barry's family - journalist Iris West, his foster sister and secret love of his life, and the detective with a heart of gold Joe West, his foster father. The best part is the chemistry between them all. There are clashes between the strict Wells and the snarky Cisco, Barry and Iris' boyfriend Eddie who you're not too sure about at first, and Eddie and Joe West with the usual "you're dating my daughter" dynamic. But none of it comes across as artificial. You believe all of the character interactions because they're developed well enough so that you're fully aware of how each person would react to each situation, and the writers are spot on when it comes to their motivations and actions. <br/><br/>The acting itself is surprisingly great. It's refreshing in a CW show to have a likable good actor as the lead, and Grant Gustin knocks it out of the park. He's usually upbeat and quirky but when he's given the important emotional beats, he pulls them off well enough to tug at your heartstrings. Everyone else is great too, even the "freak-of-the-weeks" like Captain Cold played with appropriate coldness by Wentworth Miller. The writing is also excellent for the most part. It takes a few episodes to get going but once it starts up it does not slow down. As the story starts to unravel and the plot slowly reveals itself, it's hard to take your eyes off the screen. There are more than a few jaw-dropping episodes such as the season 1 finale, and superb looking special effects and CGI monsters, namely Gorilla Grodd and King Shark.<br/><br/>Like "Arrow", there are some soap opera-y moments, but they're placed sparingly enough in the series that they don't take you out of the show. The dialogue is silly sometimes but that's what gives it its charm. It's not supposed to be brooding and gloomy like "Arrow"; it's light and upbeat while still delivering truly awesome comic book moments. And the threatening villains remain threatening - the Reverse-Flash is legitimately menacing, and the tone shifts appropriately for the episodes that he's in. In short, the writing is consistently great while managing to throw a few surprises at you along the way.<br/><br/>"The Flash" is a must-watch for "Arrow" fans, comic book fans, or action sci-fi fans in general. It's a fun take on the superhero genre and once it hits its stride, it delivers some of the coolest superhero ideas ever explored on TV. Sure, there's some filler, there's corniness. But when it's supposed to be emotional, it is. When it's supposed to be badass, it is. It's not a perfect show by any means, but it delivers on exactly what it sets out to. "The Flash" is a blast. The flash was really well made however year on year it is becoming very plain, boring and it adopts the same formula adopted each season and it is really becoming very old, very fast.<br/><br/>Season 6 is especially bad and in all honesty it's making me want to quit the series for good. The characters even look bored on screen and they all seem to all be running on auto-pilot.<br/><br/>What was once a solid 7.5 out of 10 has year on year regressed and each season it's the same old thing:
Part 1: introduce a villain
Mid season climax: introduce a cross over/crisis
Part 2: introduce main protagonist<br/><br/>The above is fine, however the way in which it is executed is just poor, each episode should serve a purpose but instead it just cashes it's paycheck without delivery of any progresssion in the story, the episode climax is also becoming highly comical and not for the right reasons. This show needs a revamp, season 6 is a write off and should be ended early with the writers needing a shake up to try and salvage all what was once good with the show Yet another series gone to pieces like all the other superhero stuff. It seems like the writers ran out of ideas in the last series and everything really got sill after crisi on infinite earths. Im finished wih all these series. The Flash is an Action,Adventure and drama series, it was produced in America in 2014 and has over 137 episodes , The Main character is Barry Allen aka The Flash aka Grant Gustin, Barry is a forentic scientist who works for the central city police, Barry had a pretty rough childhood his mother was killed by a mysterious cyclone of lightning , his innocent father was arrested by the police he was accused of murder , Barry swore to find his mother's killer and prove his father's innocence, One day an accident happens the particule accelerator explodes and creates meta-humans (People who were granted super powers after the particule accelerator exploded). Barry Fall's in a Coma when he woke up he was introduced to Harrison Wells ,Caitlin and Cisco who helped barry to control his powers and fight crime.<br/><br/>When it first started the first two seasons were fun to watch after the second season things started to get a bit to repetitve, I felt like watching the first seasons again and again The first three seasons were pretty convincing but starting from the moment "Savitar's" identity was revealed the nonsense began. The story line of creating "Savitar" was incomplete as of course to create him - "Barry's time remnant" -, he needed a motive in the first place. So how could Barry create a time remnant to fight someone that already hadn't been existed yet!!
And for the fourth season, I think it's not entertaining or lacks the type of story that attracts me, especially, for the kind of super villain story that it has. 
I have been watching season 4 until the episode before the finale waiting for something that makes me interested but still nothing. 
I think this show is collapsing at least for me. ***SPOILER ALERT***<br/><br/>I can hardly add much to the other negative reviews on this show except to say this show epitomizes what results when a bunch of radical Lefties get a hold of anything they neither had the genius nor ambition to create and attempt to revise it to suit their agenda. The show's producers boast "ground-breaking" achievements at challenging the story's original lore; i.e. - Iris West is now a Black girl, and we have an openly gay police captain whom the show's writers constantly remind us of no matter how irrelevant to the story it is. The characters and setting are are so unbelievable you have to strain to ignore such gaffs as "Where do they get the money to run STAR Labs?"... What does Ronnie aka "Firestorm" do for a living? Or Doc Stein, Catlyn, and Cisco for that matter? Just WHO is keeping the lights on around there?<br/><br/>Personally, I cannot help but think that such a show insults the intelligence of it's audience. The Flash is one of the better superhero shows but it's starting to go down considering The Flash is barely in it anymore! The show is more focused on Iris which is a huge mistake! Ever since they put her as pretty much the lead since Crisis, every episode has been the lowest rated in series history! Go back to making this show about The Flash bc when you did it was still entertaining! I absolutely don't mind women as leads in action shows but the CW is getting ridiculous. This is even coming from a liberal who's all about equality but EVERY show now has a woman as it's lead now (Supergirl, Catwoman, Stargirl, Legends of Tomorrow, Green Arrow & The Canaries, and now even The Flash and Black Lightening are all about girl power)! Every woman is portrayed as smart & tough while the men are stupid & weak! Most of them like Laurel Lance & Catwoman look so ridiculous in their fight scenes. It doesn't look like their kicks would hurt a 3-year old but a grown man goes flying or knocked out from a hit that again, wouldn't hurt a child! Season 1 of The Flash was exceptional with everything needed in a Sci-fi Action Thriller. Good story line with exciting twists and a superhero, what else do we need. But since the start of season 2, it has gone from bad to terrible numerous times. Bad acting, dismal plot and sometimes hilarious CGI didn't help its cause either. In the era of exceptional CGI in TV, with shows like GoT and Viking, this looks like a B-Grade Sci-fi movie. Before the show aired I was really excited and keen. However, after watching the entire season I couldn't help but be left a fair bit disappointed. Don't get me wrong there are things about the show I like its just that there was a lot of stuff I hated. <br/><br/>For starters I hated the inconsistency of the Flash's powers. In an early episode he can move at speed A. Then in a later episode when he's supposed to be faster he moves slower then speed A. Another ting that really really ticked me of was in the first episode he says he got his name from Oiver Queen. Then they leave it and let Iris come up with the Flash. Speaking of Iris I hated how she found out about his secret. I feel like that electric zap was in there for the sole purpose of her discovering his secret. Seriously, it's never brought up anywhere else and what are the chances that it never will. <br/><br/>There are some good episodes, some of which I really enjoyed. Despite this there are some awful ones as well. The first 8 all real like clichés to me. There's one where he loses his powers, he fights his old bully, the hero goes bad. They've all been done before and when I thought the show was picking up it went back to silly freak of the week episodes. Another thing that really annoyed me was the constant death of characters. It really annoyed me when they would create these interesting characters only to have them killed in that episode or the next. I know it didn't happen with all of them but for the most part it did. <br/><br/>Moving on to the positives. A major positive for me was the casting. I thought every actor was a good selection and played there part excellently. I loved the Easter eggs. Farris Aircrafts, Jay Garicks hat and that glimpse of the flash museum just to name a few. <br/><br/>A third positive was the Reverse Flash. Personally I loved the story of the Reverse Flash, it was handled very well and was super cool. Those short clips at the end of the episode were another plus especially when they teased the truth about Doctor Wells. Another thing the Flash did really well was Eddie. At first I thought he was just gonna be a big tough douche just in the show to be with Iris so Barry couldn't. However as the show progressed I found myself liking him more and more. In the end he was one of my favorite characters from season 1. <br/><br/>In Summary, there was plenty of stuff liked about the Flash. It's just that the stuff I didn't like far outweighed the stuff I liked and left me severely disappointed. In all of the seasons of flash my favorite season is season 1 where whole story is said that how flash is born and all the incidents happen in his life after that and also this is the best series in superhero series. i usually get quite bored of super hero TV shows but this is authentic and amazing. the first season is nail biting and the second season is just as good. the characters are good and the acting is excellent. it has witty comedy and the action sequences are impressive unlike some other superhero shows it does not get repetitive and banal it stays and maintains it's content throughout. Watch it ... just watch it I don't care what haters say about this show but I love the Flash. He's way better than the movie version of flash from Justice League. I know that the show doesn't live up to the comics but that's okay because it's entertaining. Grant Gustin is a great flash and every season is great. I hope they continue renewing seasons for The flash. After the first 2 episodes of season 3 the show became bad and after season 3 unwatchable. She is the worst!!!! Her character makes no sense. I hope this is the one and only season she is on here!! The first 2-3 seasons were great but now the show is repeating it's self while trying but failing to inovate. The characters have become completely blank and cliché. The show has become a parody of itself. Really sad. The flash started as one of the best shows ever. Season 1 was superbly awesome. Season 2 again was perfect . 
The thing that made first 2 seasons perfect were their brilliant science theory and the love triangle. 
Season 3 lost most of it's charm as the love triangle was now fully broken. Only it had a great dangerous villian.
Season 4 is dumbest season of tv ever. Except the crisis on earth X and 1 or 2 theories of the flash to defeat devoe , it did not gave me goosebumps as given by the first 3 seasons. It didn't create a fully necessity to watch the next episodes. I don't watch a lot of TV but I went to a friends house and he was excited about THE FLASH!!! So i decided to join in on it since he has a really big TV, anything on a really big TV has to be good. Unfortunately nobody has a big enough TV to make this show good.<br/><br/>At first I was laughing but to my alarm the show nor my friend was laughing with me. This is when I realized my friend might have autism or some other developmental problems. The character interaction is awkward and the acting is hilarious. Some of the scenes like when the flash pushes someone out of the way at the speed of sound apparently they land on the floor as if they had simply fallen over, and I guess running into someone at just under 800 mph is okay. I was explained that the flashes power somehow merges onto other people when he carries them...fair enough.<br/><br/>Just as most TV shows the guys look about 30 but also like they are 16 year olds and homosexual. The voices like the arrow who looks like he wasn't given to many doses of estrogen but unfortunately his voice does, at least under his batman mysterious voice from which I had many chuckles. The only saving grace was the girls are pretty hot, they don't fit the costume department, nor did they have any lines that wasn't causing me to hold in a laugh as to not annoy my friend. I couldn't actually finish watching with him bc I had an important errand to run called not watching TV that makes me worry for humanity when I see it's voted so grandly.<br/><br/>I think the show would be better if they just pulled random cards out of a hat that people wrote their lunch orders on and the show was based on the flash delivering said lunches except the flash would be played by a midget with a beard and when he stops his beard grew like 20 inches and people where like wtf there is beard in my lunch! It turns out that the people who he delivers lunches to are supervillians and he always gets the orders wrong causing the villains to give up on terror bc they can't even get what they ordered for lunch right. In turn they become chefs at a restaurant called supervillain and it becomes a 5 star restaurant run by head villain rordon goatsy. Eventually they have a cookoff and the flash can show his real talent by becoming the worlds fastest chef, or not. Plot twist, the midget is actually usain bolt but he comes from a planet far away and needs to run 1 million miles to become tall again since earth gravity is stronger than his home planet, also the flash was struck by lightning but he always had his superpowers it's just that the lightning was his wake up call that he shouldn't be afraid to run fast because life is to short to worry about dying when you could be at a super-lab with your best friends who also invented a water that makes them super young looking. The arrow unfortunately had a cigarette fall in his water before he drank it permanently giving him a smokers throat. Tune in for the next episode where the day after the cook off the flash develops walking farts, imagine the conundrum he faces when he is traveling at the speed of sound. But after what happened, I will never give one second of my time to these one-track thinking Nazis. CW is officially off my watch list. This show started off great! The origin! The motivation but man...I have never found any love interest more annoying than iris. Season 1 was pretty amazing with great dialogue and plot line with some cool action but season 2 is when it starts to pick up, it's amazing! Season 3 was cool..nothing special and season 4 was meh, it just felt like every episode was the same!
Every Flash episode in a nutshell:
1. The flash gets destroyed by the new meta-human (infected person with powers)
2. The flash gets all sad then has his wife in his ear giving him a sappy motivational speech
3. He then beats the meta-human<br/><br/>See what I mean? Got addicted to this show right off the bat with season one. Then season 2 came and once again surpassed my expectations. Season 3 felt a bit repetitive with having the main villain once again be a speedster but it still was a good season to watch. Then season 4 came. It was right around here where it felt like they got lazy and cheesy. I mean how many freaking hallway talks do they need to have. I'm currently almost done with season 5 and it is by far the absolute worst season. If I was rating this show based off season 5 I'd give it 2 stars. Both Iris and Nora are super annoying and feel like they bring the show down in every episode. The writing seems to have gotten lazy along with the acting. Barry and Cisco seem to be the only strong characters left along with Sherlock. The rest of the characters including the antagonist just come off as lame. Wish this show could go back to being as good as it used to be. The first season of this show is an outstanding superhero tv show, and just an outstanding tv show overall. The story kept me so captivated and interested, and while it had a lot of relationship drama, it was still a show I looked forward to every week<br/><br/>Season two, while it didn't reach season ones highs, was still comparable in quality. After that, it starts to go downhill, and fast. The writing just got so bad, unbearably. The fourth season starts as an improvement on the second, but soon just drags. Season five is all over the place. Some good, some bad, some unwatchable. In fact, I've missed episodes and still felt like I missed nothing, gone back, and been correct. This show would benefit so much if it had a 10-13 episode season.<br/><br/>Watch the first two seasons, they're great. After that, there are some great episodes, specifically season three's Infantino Street, but overall, it's less than mediocre past season two The first and second season were great but after that the show goes downhill. It's not bad but it is no longer great and overall its just a 6/10. At some point during Season 3 I gave up. I had high hopes for this but then again it's a PG show.<br/><br/>However that's not an excuse for ridiculous plot dynamics. I have this gripe with all CW 'superhero' shows. They're for 11 year olds.. not that Marvel/Netflix are perfect but there is a certain element of tin-can dialogues and emotional dynamics that could have been taken from a thousand other shows before..<br/><br/>It's not the rating that bothers me. I understand why it is where it is. It's the lack of quality other than the CGI in this show. I have not regretted giving it up. Let's hope for a better Flash show in the future. Like many others have said, this show did start with a great surprise. It opened a new point of view of superheroes and the mysterious death of Barry's mother is the conflict that propels this whole plot forward.
But as the first season ended, this whole show had a great ending and it should have been just left like that. Season two is not THAT disappointing; it's still okay. When it came to season 3, gosh, the producers forced drama into this show and made it EXTREMELY awkward and a total cliche. Like when they accidentally made Barry lose his memory and Barry was in front a building that was on fire. Iris just talked to Barry and said a lot of cheesy words and then Barry was like, "I remember..." And the "romance" between Wally and Jesse are also not natural. This show DOES deserve to be classified in drama genre.
I only watched the first episode of season 4. I thought it would redeem itself, but again, I was disappointed. Iris used her "superpowers" again, aka cheesy words, and the Barry just got crazy. ????? (somebody help??) And this time, not only Iris, but Joe also learned to be "inspiring". And Barry just ran out of the lab and defeated the samurai in a instant. Lame. Where the heck is your sword, samurai???? That storming sword is able to do great splash damage to the people and he never though of using it????
So whoever is interested in watching this TV show, I strongly recommend you that watch the first season only, but if you are interested, then you may watch the second season, but no more! If you do wanna know more, then just look up the plot review. The first two seasons of the Flash were above-average. They captured a goofy superhero and the Silver-Age bogus science. Most of the characters were well-rounded and sympathetic. Despite this, already early on there were many cracks in the fabric. I am a fan of a lot of cheesiness and camp, and that's one reason I felt that the 90s Spider-Man cartoon is still watchable. However, the Flash has a lot of missteps in its cheese department, being hammy or eye-roll-inducing (in a bad way) instead of pleasant or entertaining. The Flash spends only about 40% of the show doing actual superhero action, and there's a lot of inconsistencies in his abilities. The melodrama was endurable, but not especially enjoyable, and the "surprise villains" were very predictable. The two seasons ended relatively the same way, on some kind of pseudo-cliffhanger, and, of course, a lot of running.<br/><br/>Season 3 doubled-down on everything wrong with the show, and despite the broad library of Flash comics they could have drawn from, a lot of the season was rehash of things we had already seen. The villain was basically copy-pasted from the other two seasons with a senseless twist that doesn't really have any emotional weight. The melodrama was dialed up to 11, some actually likable characters became jerks for basically no reason, there were tired side-plots, and it was a long slog to get through. I would give that season a 4. <br/><br/>The show goes on, so I hope it gets better, but I am not especially optimistic.<br/><br/>One last thing SPOILER: in season 3, Savitar tricks a character to trade places with him in his prison. Why did he feel the need to trick that character into his plan when he could have just used the Rival? I really can't get over that. Forst 2 seasons were awsome but after that the show seems to be majorly targetting, focusing and forcebly imposing on some specific things un necessarily. Being dragged and has become a piece of crap Seasons 1-4 were very enjoyable. I looked forward the watching the story progress. Every since Nora joins the show it's a struggle to make it through each episode. The basic plot of each show is now the same. A villain does something bad. Nora does something stupid or irritating like acting like a 6 year old or disobeying her parents advice and makes the situation worse. Team Flash fixes it and Nora learns a lesson that she ignores the following show. She's one of the most irritating characters I've ever seen. I'm going to try to make it through this season hoping she dies at the end and season 6 gets back to good storytelling. While The Flash isn't truly awful, it's certainly not up there with the good TV programmes.<br/><br/>The opening credits of Season 2 has Barry Allen/The Flash talking about the rift HE created through his own selfish motives, which allowed dangerous meta-humans to invade our world. He then congratulates himself by telling us that only HE is fast enough to stop them!! Heroic? More like a spoilt brat in need of a serious slap!! <br/><br/>Anyone brought up watching Sci-Fi will understand that when time travelling, changing the past also changes the present. Our 'Super Hero' hasn't quite figured this one out for himself yet. He travels back in time on a few occasions, once again, for his own selfish reasons, only to be shocked to find he's done something to detrimentally alter his own time. OK, doing it once is stupid, but you can sort of make allowances because he's just a kid with a new super-power and he gets carried away with his own importance. After 3 such acts of stupidity, you really have to start wondering just how 'heroic' he actually is!! <br/><br/>It's like watching a zombie constantly walking into a locked, glass door. The fact that Barry Allen is so self obsessed, so doesn't learn from his mistakes, just gets boring after a while... especially when he gets all depressed about the effect his actions of having on him, as if the world is working against him! <br/><br/>Overall, a silly, spoilt, whiny character. If you haven't heard of this show by now then i hope you never do and i fervently hope you never get to see this stupidfest of a Tv show, i sadly was unfortunate enough to see the whole first season and yeah i binge watched it hoping against hope that maybe somewhere along the line it wouldn't feel so ridiculous anymore, sadly that time never came, it went from bad to terrible to downright worse until you are hoping someone came along and put a bullet in your brain or the brain dead characters who totally deserve one, seriously even a six year child could see through the plot holes that aren't just one or two but are everywhere i mean honestly speaking where do you even begin, The Flash got his Superpowers when he was hit by a freak lightning which happens via the services of the ever open to everyone S.T.A.R labs, apparently its such a high tech facility that doesn't even employ a guard, anyone anytime could just walk in like as if you are strolling through the park, the Flash is apparently as fast as lightning but apparently not fast as the not even having super power villains who come around kick his ass all over the place on a regular basis, he goes to his father starts crying, goes back to his colleagues at the lab where they give him some hair brained advice and some corny lines he then goes back to his job where his guardian/stepfather/future father in law also works and then he feeds him some corny lines as well trying to get his confidence up so his little girl in a superhero costume doesn't get his ass kicked again and then there is the pain in the ass and to the viewers eyes girlfriend of The flash, who just wants to be the center of attention no matter what, its incredible to know that in a matter of few episodes you can go from becoming a waiter to a reporter i wish real life was like that too, also she has a lifetime anytime access to star labs because apparently that how she finds out about barry being the flash, guys have you ever heard of a door, also its not like barry is trying to keep his identity secret because by the end of the first season it almost feels like half the town knows who this stupid moron playing superhero is, he is supposed to be funny instead he is anything but that, he is the super hero having his periods and there is probably not one episode where he isn't crying or straight out bawling, i fail to understand whats wrong with men these days if they are even called men, you have to be dumb as a rock to like this show, i read a review here that this show is meant for 6-15 year old kids, trust me no kid should be made to watch this tripe, i was always a big fan of the Flash, this is definitely not the Flash we grew up on but unfortunately the brain dead comatose people running the Soap opera channel CW don't think so.<br/><br/>Good Luck if you still watch! Flash is another name for bs. Horrible CGI will make you cry more than the supposedly emotional scenes staring iris west ofcourse. Every character is full of melodrama and in a 45 min episode barely 5 mins are for the plot and the rest is some character crying over how hard their life is. Flash is just too predicable except the first season which actually made me watch the rest of the show and now I really really regret it. Watch something logical not some teenage girl drama that will shrink your brain. I love Arrow. As far as superhero TV goes, it's my favorite so far. So when I heard the CW would be doing The Flash as well, I just about had a nerd-gasm.Then I watched the show.<br/><br/>My rating breaks down as follows. 1 point for the attempt. 1 point for the costume. 1 point for the actor who plays Barry and for the nod in The Arrow. -7 points for the rest of the cast, the plot, the script, and the inability to do any sort of background research. For those of you who liked the show, stop now or forever hold your peace.<br/><br/>No I'm not too familiar with the Flash's back-story. I was never really a fan. But even without all of that, you can tell that the plot was hatched from the mind of an eight-year old. I'm not going to be going off the original comics here, or calling what is cannon and what isn't. This is simply a tip of the hat to the men and women who will surely burn in the same level of hell as the Fox executives that canceled Firefly. The story is pathetic and the characters are lack-luster at the least.<br/><br/>As far as I'm concerned, the only original character or actor who is worth anything in the show is Barry Allen. And this is achieved through sheer force of personality of the actor. The script-writers should all be shot in the kneecaps. His performance alone carries the entire show character wise. Despite the fact that he is simply and emulation of Oliver Queen from Arrow, he manages to at least give his character a slightly more "I have no idea what I'm doing" feel.<br/><br/>Finally, my favorite part. The inability to be intelligent. Understand now, that this being a superhero show and thus prone to massive lapses in actual science, I have chosen to disregard most of those faults. Also, here comes the spoiler bit. It was mentioned, that along with his physical speed, his reaction time was increased. To this end, he was often shown to move at a normal speed while others moved in slow motion. And then he was often not. He is quite capable of "slowing time" to rescue people from a train wreck, but immediately afterwards loses the ability when a gun is pointed at him from a fairly reasonable distance. Maybe he just didn't want his friends being shot? But when that bad guy turns and walks away 30 seconds later, he also seems unable to run. The man was on foot and he simply walked away. In the third fight with the tin man (Was it chroma?) he easily moves out of the way of his punches, but ten seconds later, forgets how to let go of a pole and at the same time loses his abilities. That's all the continuity I'm gonna nitpick, on to the research.<br/><br/>When training with the cops partner, he is told to "Punch as if your aiming for something six inches behind the target." As any good boxer knows, this is precisely the opposite of what you should do. Minimizing the contact time is essential to delivering the most force in a blow. And Barry, being a rather smart superhero, should know this. The writers have obviously never read so much as a paragraph on how to hit someone. Then there is the other things like police procedure no real precinct would ever allow, guns that fire too many bullets, a hummer that pulverizes two police cars and comes out with not so much as a dented fender, and other small things like that.<br/><br/>Sorry these are all mostly from episode 6. It's that last one I saw and apparently all the rest are too forgettable for me to be able to refer back to them. Please send all hate mail to someone who is not me and all love letters to my username @gmail.com Now, I'm off to line the walls of my den. The network executive's heads are alphabetized, so CW goes before Fox... Reviewing shows can be quite a challenge so I'll be reviewing by seasons<br/><br/>Season 1
The first season of the "Arrow" spin-off, gives us one of DC comics best superheroes, and in one it's best shows no less. Buoyed by Grant Gustin's Phenomenal performance as Barry Allen who captures all the fun, energy, and heart of the character, the ensemble cast also proves fantastic. The light tone, beautiful storytelling and great character moments prove this to be one of the best Superhero shows on television.<br/><br/>Season 2
The second season of "The Flash" proves the show has much more than a season under its belt. Thanks to the continued love from each of the cast, and welcomed new comers Keyian Lionsdale and Teddy Sears. The Zoom story arch is fantastic and with the introduction of the fan favorite multiverse, allowing for greater adventures down the road. This season balances all of the fun, drama, fan service, and character moments all wrapped up in an unexpected ending that will leave you breathless.<br/><br/>Season 3
This season starts off with a bang, introducing us to the Flashpoint arch, but sadly butchers the classic comic storyline by only using it in one episode. The rest of the season in terms of story is very jumbled, containing many great moments and episodes with a lot going on. The cast continues to shine and I've got to say Carlos Valdes, Danielle Panabaker, Tom Cavanagh, Candice Patton, and Jesse L. Martin, are fantastic in the show (and always have been) but this season they all really get to shine in terms of character development and great interactions with one another proving they are much more than a cast, but a family. The introduction of Kid-Flash is nice and the villain is the worst, but Grant has a nice turn portraying both characters. A nice season but has some story problems that could've been more interesting.<br/><br/>Season 4
The fourth season is a lot of build up and little pay off, in story once again. In terms of character it's fantastic Barry and Iris go through some of the best development and continue to shine as there respective characters. (Especially after getting married) New cast members Hartley Sawyer and Neil Sandilands (when he is there) do great in there respective roles. The Thinker is also a great villain when Sandilands is on screen, we never see him that often and when he switches bodies it gets on my nerves. The season also tries to squeeze in so many storylines its hard to keep up (and they're all good, it's just a lot) all in all it's a good season, but it's wildly ambitious and tries to many ideas.<br/><br/>Season 5
It starts out a little slow, but all in all Season 5 is a beautiful return to form for the show, while also adding to the Series well established lore in a great fashion, and while the villain is fairly forgettable, this season is built more on "The Flash Family" and the ever so fresh performance from Jessica Parker Kennedy, and the beautiful season finale. So in every episode someone has a secret then the others find out they are pissed off they forgive him and then the next person has a secret the others find out they are pissed off then they forgive him, then the next person has a secret... Are we getting dumber as an audience? Since plots and narratives are getting more simple and obvious in the Hollywood realm. The Flash shows all its cards straight away. Good guy vs bad guy, a pretty girl that will probably need saving, epic end-boss, obvious love-story. Characters literally explain their motives, almost while looking at the audience through the camera. Don't know what a particle accelerator is? Here let me write it down on a chalk board!<br/><br/>Legendary series like The Wire, Sopranos, True Detective, and more, feature enticing narratives, pushed forth by symbols, layers of meaning , human complexities and engaging acting. They are OK with keeping some mystery and tell multiple narratives in multiple manners. They push the viewer to think, anticipate and take him or her seriously. I don t want to see a Barry's crying face anymore.
almost every episode i have watched 
there is no any thing that could prove he is a real man <br/><br/>i am not a professor in physics , 
but i can say 
dead mans can't travel trough time<br/><br/>i think this one not suitable for me. some one who cant understand particle acceleration What I hate the most about this show is the inconsistencies regarding Barry's power. Every seasons he gets faster, even then, villains throw a little smoke bomb and disappear as if they were speedsters.<br/><br/>They should at least try to make explanations, like: he can only run for 30 seconds and his energy has to be replenished, or maybe he needs to drink something special since he's burning a lot of calories, whatever.<br/><br/>If the writers would put more time into the scripts, it would be nice. I'm not sure exactly who this movie was made for, I mean if it were made exclusively for 13 year old children, then I might be very understanding as to why it feels really weird to watch, I literally can't stand this movie, Please who wrote the scripts? No imagination! at first I thought it must be one of those indoor nerds who wrote the entire thing but then, there was that episode where apparently Cisco had to hack the city's network and they weren't being explicit as to what "network" they wanted to hack, then apparently the network was hacked in 4 seconds, like I could see the laptop the apparent hacker used showing graphic images of 3D models, that was when I knew it wasn't even a geek who wrote the Script. The languages are too clichÃ© and I had to ask for help to un-see this thing. don't even get me started with the Intro speech. But then again, perhaps they wanted just an audience of 13 year olds. Characters are easy to root for with this strong ensemble, led with seamless emotional truth of Grant Gustin. Jesse L. Martin and Tom Cavanagh ground the rest of the cast of characters. I am not a big comic sci-fi person but am enjoying the ride still 4 seasons later. Season 1 is still best and season 3 was the hardest to watch with its dark plot, but no one is phoning it in on this labor love of super producer Greg berlanti. Season 4 got back to the show's roots with more comedy and an intricately well plotted season arc. Grant Gustin is honing his chops for an award winning acting career ahead The Flash is still my favorite Arrowverse show.<br/><br/>Many of these reviews have complained about Nora, but Nora has NEVER been the problem with this season.<br/><br/>Next season will be Flashpoint, resetting the entire universe. This season has been a slow burn to set the stage for Eobard Thawne's return NEXT season. (imo)<br/><br/>Nora is going to be a bright spot going forward. PLEASE keep her! This is THE best show I have ever watched... I love sci-fi everything and this show is amazing.. I watch this show on repeat.... Please just don't kill "Cisco Ramon (Carlos Valdes)" in season 5...his acting is amazing no doubt... He's the main reason I watch this show... He's funny he's talented Looking at the reviews for The Flash here.....it's rather pathetic. People claim the writing sucks, the characters are silly, the story is lame.....well I am here to tell you that THEY ARE ALL WRONG!!!!<br/><br/>The Flash is awesome! With only one season down it's proved it is a force to be reckoned with! It's got an amazing cast, incredible stories, visual effects, acting, cinematography. Season 1 is in my honest opinion the BEST LIVE ACTION SUPER HERO ADAPTATION EVER!<br/><br/>A lot of the reviews on here say the Flash is really bad. Like one of the worst shows ever, claiming that the only reason it has a rating over 8/10 is because of fandom.....this isn't true. They are basing their hate of the show on the first few episodes. I can honestly admit that the first few episodes aren't that great, I can admit that. It felt like a mediocre series. However once you hit the mark of Episode 9.....that's when the real fun begins. The stories from there only get more involving, intriguing and overall amazing.<br/><br/>The whole Reverse Flash Story is perfectly executed, with plot twists and turns thrown at you nearly every episode. It was hard to see what would happen next! It just kept getting better and better. The Flash actually stands up as being BETTER than Arrow....and far better than Smallville....regardless of what some reviews say.<br/><br/>Needless to say The Flash is the definitive superhero ride. It's going to be tough for season 2 to match season 1 or even exceed it, but Arrow Season 2 did it, so why can't the Flash.<br/><br/>I do have some negatives though, none of which are the show's characters, heck even Iris West is a cool character, far better than Arrow's Laurel Lance. Some of the negatives stem from the first few episodes which other reviewers use as a basis to criticise the entire show. Don't judge it all if you haven't seen it all...cause if you'd have seen it all....you'd realise your first thoughts were silly.<br/><br/>The Flash to me is one of those rare 10/10 shows, like Game of Thrones, Battlestar Galactica, Lost and Doctor Who. It ranks up there for me in my top 10 shows of all time. Oh my god I love this show. The Flash is everything DC's movies currently aren't: good.<br/><br/>It's perfect. Just watch this show. The characters feel real and the story is compelling. They managed to keep a fun, light atmosphere while still delivering a gripping story. I truly feel for these characters when they go through a situation.<br/><br/>Grant Guston is the Flash. He plays the character with such sincerity that you lose sight of the fact that he's an actor.<br/><br/>The same goes for Jesse Martin as Joe West. Any scene with either him or Tom Cavanagh steals the show. Their performances don't even belong on a CW show. They are punching so much higher than their pay grade.<br/><br/>Plus, you can tell that everyone on the show really loves being there. This show is a celebration of comic books and I wouldn't have it any other way! Plz bring back the 1st season happy Barry. Remove Iris, remove Nora, and don't make another Wells.
Barry should be a cheerful character like spiderman in marvel universe. The overdramatic melancholic part should be reduced. This review is for the season 4 and 5. I really can't understand all the good reviews recently for this show. Either they are talking about the first seasons, are fake, or I don't belong on this planet. They are the worst. In the latest episode berry had a fit about having to kill someone, gets up and walks away very slowly to go give his disappointed daughter a hug, as the villain gets away again. we almost rage quit. I have never seen such constant stupidity displayed in a show. The flash could defeat almost anyone with eas. A really cool power that he only uses right when it doesn't matter. When it does he acts like a bumbling idiot that need his friends to give him a hug and a talking to before he can get the job done. We still watch the show, not for the joy the first season brought , but so we can yell at it. It is so bad it's good. What a relief when this trash will be over. I have become a prisoner to it since we have watched since the beginning. My daughter (8) and I both enjoy watching this show. She got interested in Flash from her classmates at school and now awaits eagerly each week for the new episode. I had never read a Flash comic book growing up so was totally unfamiliar with it. The great part is that my daughter has now gotten me really hooked on this show. The plot lines are well devised and the show is entertaining and well-paced. Nuclear Man was probably the best episode so far with a great combination of action and good acting. The character of Dr Wells is brilliantly crafted as alternately good and evil, and Grant Gutsin gives a brilliantly nuanced performance as Barry Allen. Cant wait to find out more about the origin story as the season advances and the story of the death of Barry's mother Nora is developed further. Hope this show continues for several more seasons. I think that this flash series are staying for a long time, and after all berry alen will be the flash that our generation will remember as the fastest man alive the flash. Keep the good work guys, every season is getting the series into a new level.My personal opinion, i could see more seasons, so don't close it too early. Those moments that you gave us are the best. Beautiful story and definitely one of my favourite dc series and characters! I love how the story all fits in and the message this series sends. Good action scenes and really suspenseful! Every season is always better than the last! I am a long time fan of The Flash and used to love the TV show back when Barry was actually the main hero and the villains weren't just random people off the street that got these lame sub par "super powers." I mean being able to unlock a car should not be a challenge for the fastest man alive, and it isn't but it is for his over dramatic, un like able annoying daughter Nora it does. I hate Iris and Nora these to characters make Barry so soft and coddle him like a baby they are always sitting him down for some long annoying pep talk that happens way to often. While I hate Nora, Iris is far worse by not even having powers. They put Iris in mid fight situations where she has a gun... yea a gun agains't people with super powers and some how this character isn't dead. Back in Season four they teased Iris's death but every one could see from a mile away that it was the stupid goofy wells just taking her place. The small hope I got from that was instantly crushed by then next season replacing his grandson from the comics with a strong independent female women. Now moving on to my biggest problem, If you have a show called the Flash and the main character, the Flash is locked in the pipe line for not just half of the episode but the whole one! Are you kidding me the first episode back and we don't even get to see the Flash? What I'm trying to say is more Flash and less every one else. This TV show was so strong back when you had amazing villains like reverse flash and zoom who instantly posed more of a threat to barry than some average joe with a stick. It is clear that this show is declining and maybe it's just me but I feel as though this show would grow leaps and bounds if both Nora and Iris got killed off. One last point is if you look at the comics vs the show it is very clear that they black washed the cast and i'm not saying it's a bad thing it's just extremely and apparent and not true to the comics. All in all this show was a jem and is now falling apart, with the new inclusion of Nora and less of Barry it scares me to see what will come of this show.
P.S.
God speed would be such a great villain for the next season Carlos Valdes is so ugly it makes me puke. That girl hair just screams transvestite, but I'm not here to comment that. I'm here to comment the series, and my god is it the worst flash interpretation ever. I'm guessing this got approved for more episodes because people leave their TV on and go do other stuff so they don't change the channel when this garbage comes on. Because it truly is garbage. Compared to the original movies this is the worst take you could take on the flash. I mean, the flash was a 40 year old forensic scientist. The whole point was to prove that someone in that age could become amazingly fast. That's why it wasn't a young actor playing the main part, it's brazen and unsatisfactory. Unfrotunately though, the main actor in the series ain't that bad. It's his coworkers, the plot, the setting, the effects and basically everything else I have an issue with. Oh, an Carlos Valdes who looks like an ugly transvestite with that girl hair, but I'll leave that aside for now. The problems and situations that the flash faces are superficial and dumb. There is no real story line and Valdeses ugly face just ruins everything, I constantly had to half close my eyes not so see that ugly s*it and barf everything. Please stop making new episodes before you either figure out how to write screenplays or before you fire that ugly transvestite. Anyway, it would be great to see an older actor play the flash. Someone with some wisdom and some brains for a change. This just looks a bunch of kids got together and decided to do a series with paintbrush effects and a story written by their 5 year old cousin. Srsly, guys, stop making this s*it and ruining the legacy of the flash movies. The flash movies are classics, this is just trash. Without a doubt, The Flash is an accomplished series with great writing, direction and acting. It does seem like it was made by fans, for fans and regardless whether you like superhero stories or not, or maybe you're a sci-fi fan or not, the core of the series is the great story-telling and the characters; you will enjoy it. <br/><br/>Anchoring the ensemble cast is Grant Gustin who has quite the acting range; the man has talent and he wears the role of Barry Allen with great panache. Other main cast members are equally strong, with Tom Canavagh (Harrison Wells) filling in multiple roles throughout 3 seasons, Jesse L Martin (Det. Joe West) as the father figure, Carlos Veldes (Cisco) and Danielle Panabaker (Caitlyn) as the adorable nerds of Team Flash. <br/><br/>But the driving force of the series are the writers, who somehow crammed decades worth of Flash comic material into 3 seasons so far with near masterful execution, focusing the theme of what it means to be a hero; the tragedy of it, the choices made and their unintended consequences - all while traveling through time and dimensions.<br/><br/>Commenting on other reviewers that gave this show a low score; true, this isn't Breaking Bad, nor is it Game of Thrones. Quite possibly these reviewers are looking for something along the lines of Nolan's Dark Knight which will not work for The Flash. <br/><br/>As it stands, The Flash is a great superhero series in it's own right. It is fluffy but it has substance. Thoroughly recommended. And yeah, Supergirl is garbage. This show continues to impress me with a third season that brought a new emotional twist to the series. Each season has had great use of suspense and mystery making you question who the villain really is, or sometimes a question of who is behind a mask. I hope that this show continues to grow in popularity. Best TV show hands down. I have watched and re watched each season over and over again because simply it is the best show in history. Hate to tell you but it isn't going to fly, it is too much like Saturday morning cartoons.<br/><br/>I have to type in ten lines of text but I cannot think of anything other than telling you that this is a major flop. I do not enjoy saying this but it is true. It doesn't follow script like Ironman and Green Lantern, The set is great but the direction/director is just awful. I would guess that this is the directors first job. It is so amateur. Keep in mind I only wanted to write the first two lines but since there is a ten line limit I have to tell the complete truth but the first two lines was all it needed. OK, so, here we have The Flash, back door piloted through Arrow (which I enjoy for many reasons that rhyme with smoke).<br/><br/>After watching the pilot and episode 2, I had SERIOUS smallville flashbacks. The dialogue is terrible, the way the scenes blend into other is even worse. I actually cringe at the way the story unfolds. Flash, ironically, feels very rushed, too rushed if you ask me.<br/><br/>Again DC have a brilliant premise and the execution of a toilet that just wont flush.<br/><br/>Smallville was mindless garbage, with just a sprinkle of fun. The Flash is THAT BAD, and it's only just started.<br/><br/>Gotham, in my opinion, is even worse. Season 1 of the Flash was the most brilliant thing I have ever seen in the entirety of my TV Show watching history. I still get a chill when I remember sitting in front of the television waiting for the new episode of Flash to air. However, that excitement is now gone due to monotonous and absolute stupidity when it comes to episodes these days. (Hint: We are the Flash). <br/><br/>Reverse-Flash was probably the most awesome villain I had ever seen in a TV show back then and he still makes no. 3 when I rank my favorite villains to date. (Darth Vader and Joker, so tough choice man!) The chills I got when I saw him beating Barry into nothing, it was great! Season 1 altogether was a wild, crazy and awesome ride. Villains like Leonard Snart and Weather Wizard kept changing the game for Barry, giving him a lesson every time. Iris was an amazing character who had her own story, and it was really funny what Barry would do to keep his secret from her. However, that was all changed when it ended.<br/><br/>The directors tried keeping this pattern through Season 2, and while it was a good pattern, the plots started falling off. Iris no longer had her own story as a part of Team Flash, Barry's love interest was kind of lame and the only good parts of Season 2 were Oliver, Harry and Zoom. Team Flash expanded and in so many ways, this expansion got annoying. YOU DON'T NEED TO HAVE SO MUCH SCREEN TIME CANDICE PATTON CHILL OUT. As time went on, I realized that the only bone chill I ever got from Season 2 was when Zoom was first revealed and he put Barry in a wheelchair. It was really lame otherwise, and the finale was so disappointing. <br/><br/>Here comes Season 3, the reason I quit the Flash. IRIS IS STUPID. Savitar should've killed her man. Dumbass. The plot was super predictable since they're using the speedster villain template over and over again. Every episode contains a motivational speech now that magically gives Speedsters hope and speed and every episode had the terrible CGI that is Savitar. STICK TO REGULAR HUMANS MAN! No need for Megatron: Speedster Edition. The remastered Blu-Ray Star Wars CGI was better. And I've gotten into the habit of calling the Savitar unveiling, the Savitar unboxing (it does look like Unbox Therapy with a fancy box, don't blame me.)<br/><br/>In the end, I've completely stopped watching the Flash, and I would recommend you not to go beyond Season 1, if you don't want to waste your time. The flash has been one of my favourite shows for the last few seasons and after the end of the last season I was super excited for season 3 and I really enjoyed this season even though it was definitely the weakest season yet. The premise of the season sees after zoom took everything away from him Barry Decided to travel in time to save his parents and create a new timeline called flashpoint which he intends to live his life out in. Grant gustin is Barry Allen and once again he is totally fantastic in his role, he brings so much humanity to the role and I always truly care about Barry. He also brings the humour to his character that does make him such a likable person. The supporting cast is a bit of a mixed bag this season, Danielle panabaker as Caitlin snow is given a lot more to do this season with her role and I really found her an interesting watch. Savitar is the villain this season, the god of speed when revealed becomes an interesting character and i found his story with Barry to be really interesting to watch. Tom cavanagh is back but as a third version as Harrison wells and I will admit this is easily my least favourite version of the character, I just found him incredibly eccentric and over the top and I didn't enjoy this version of the character. Iris west is an interesting character and they go far this season with the iris and Barry relationship and I just found her to be really underutilized this season. The story of the season is interesting seeing Barry dealing with this alternate universe and this season had a real emotional tale to it and I thought it was really interesting seeing the characters dealing with these situations. The script was really good season probably doing the best job of combining humour and drama to its show that is possible. The style is good, the action is still great with high production levels really selling the action. However, there are a few too many filler episodes this season and I am a bit bored of the two speedsters fighting dynamic that I do believe is starting to hurt the show. Overall this is a really enjoyable season of the flash and I hope they get even better next season. Tuesday nights are "Flash Night" in my house. It's a time when I snuggle on the couch with my four kids, and we tune in to one of the few can't-miss shows on TV.<br/><br/>Is some of the dialogue cheesy? Yes. Are some of the plots thin? Yes. But this is a comic-book show, and comics are cheesy and full of all-too-convenient plot devices. I'm OK with that.<br/><br/>What I love about this show is that it is (generally) safe for young audiences, with very little objectionable material. My kids are enthralled with every move that Barry makes, and were on the edge of their seats from week to week waiting for the confrontation with Reverse Flash in Season 1 and now Zoom in Season 2.<br/><br/>If you're looking for Shakespearean depth, look elsewhere. If you're looking for fun, this show delivers. The Flash is a series about Barry Allen as a so called meta-human whose powers is extreme speed. Barry Allen is a very interesting and complex person, not to mention that he's a very likable and sincere guy. His day job as a forensic scientist makes for a very interesting character and displays his intelligence in a genuinely spectacular manner. <br/><br/>Meta-humans, case-solving, interesting use and abuse of the powers given to Barry Allen and much more makes for a truly great and spectacular superhero series that will only continue to grow in seasons to come.<br/><br/>The series is filled with excitement and does not only make comic book fans jump off of their chairs in joy, but also introduces non-comic book fans into the DC-universe. When i first saw the show came out i was a little hesitant to watch it because i thought it would a cheese little show. After watching the first few episodes i was hook. The show was so good i watched all of the first season in two days. Tons of detail went into this show and you can really tell just from the pilot, not just your average superhero show. I cant wait for the rest of season 2 to come out. I've been sitting on the edge of my seat. The first season was so good I almost cried when it came to a end. (I'm not a baby when it comes to a TV show or movie) I would recommend this show to all of my friends, 10 out of 10! Back in 1940 Gardner F .Fox created a unique superhero who was the fastest man alive after breathing in the fumes of Hard water for over a 12 hour period Jay Garrick discovered that he was the fastest man alive and decided to use these powers to help those in need. He called himself the Flash. With a WWI soldiers helmet on his head a red shirt with a lightening bolt on it he looked like Mercury. The Flash lasted in popularity until roughly 1952 when He and the rest of his team mates in the Justice Society of America made their last appearances. Afterwards the comics industry hit a massive slump<br/><br/>Flash Forward to 1956. The comics industry is in a slump. Nothing is selling well except for Superman Batman wonder woman Aquaman and Green Arrow. Aquaman and Green Arrow only survive because they are the back ups to superman and Batman. but still something needs to be done. Enter Julie Schwartz. Schwartz is a young editor at DC Comics and he is toying with a idea. To bring back the superheroes. He wants to revive the Flash but not Jay Garrick. He likes the idea of a fastest man alive doing impossible things . So he turns to Writer Robert Kanigher and Artist Carmine infantino. together in a weekend the three of them plot the origin story of the New Flash to be seen in DC Comics SHOWCASE PRESENTS. Showcase issue four hits the stands featuring the Flash and a new age begins the silver age of comics. The New Flash is police scientist Barry Allen who was struck by lightening while standing in front of a rack featuring every known chemical known to man. The lightening bolt strikes the chemicals and creates a reaction in Barry Allen it rewrites his DNA to give him incredible speed. The Flash was a Hit Barry Allen was a scientist and science featured a lot in the Flash stories. Now Flash forward to 1985 Barry Allen was killed during the Crisis on infinite Earths. And became DC's patron saint of noble heroes. During the early 90's a TV Show THE FLASH starred John Wesley Shipp as Barry Allen as the Flash and it did well. but it missed the boat in terms of characterization turning Barry Allen into a hip guy who worked hand in glove with Star LAbs and fought crime while sharing a love triangle with Two women. While the Shipp series was fun it wasn't the Flash ,<br/><br/>Now DC is trying it again and pouring he Flash into the same mold as Green Arrow. While ARROW isn't Green Arrow from the comics it's a good solid show with great chracterizations. And a knack for telling a story. They borrowed the formula and poured the Flash into it making it almost a carbon copy of the Arrow. Grant Gustin's Barry Allen is young. Younger then Barry Allen originally was supposed to be. But he brings a freshness to it. And the fact is the show gives him a reason for being the Flash. Despite his being uncertain or his team in being uncertain. The first four episodes were highly enjoyable. And I look forward to seeing more of them. If they can keep up this pace they may truly have a winner here. Where Gotham and Arrow are gloomy and dark. The Flash is light and fun. And it's a good adventure show. Like I said if they keep the pace. And the invent full way of creating the Flash's famed rogues gallery. This will be a show to watch. The roller coaster that is this show, centers around Barry Allen, a young man whose mother was murdered by an unknown super powered individual, who proceeds to frame Barry's father for the crime. Afterwards a young Barry moves in with his best Friend Iris West, and her father, Joe West. He later becomes a CSI for the police and during one night a freak accident occurs giving him similar powers to his mother's killer. With the help of the Scientists at STAR Labs Barry becomes the hero known as the Flash. This show is action packed and has great story line and is also very funny at times I highly recommend!!! I watched the first couple seasons of The Arrow but by the third season - yeesh. The entire cast was about 15 years old and silly beyond belief. The Flash follows the same superhero formula and the boredom of it sets in immediately. The mysterious mentor. The tough disbelieving cop. The BFF who knows nothing but will be shocked, tearful, angry by the inevitable truth. The love interest who is perpetually crabby. The nerdy sidekick. The one-armed man subplot about the death of a loved one. Superhero abilities and bad guys - interchangeable with anything on TV today. What annoys me the most, though, is the 20-something "doctor." Hollywood loves the young hot girl playing doctor. Twelve years of higher education, internship, residency and then presumably a bunch of years of experience - all by the age of 26. Awesome Show Had A Great Feeling While Watching Flash It's Really Amazing. OK so I'm part way through season 2 and I must say I really am enjoying this show. It's a gr8 fun watch and can get surprisingly dark and emotional at times without diving head first into soap opera territory (Arrow I'm looking at you. Gave up after 2 seasons). <br/><br/>The Flash isn't afraid of going full comic book mode on the viewer and embraces the colourful and quirky nature of the comic book universe. I mean come on they had Grodd and a shark man. It really just adds to the epic fun nature of the show. <br/><br/>The emotional angst that we are overloaded with in Arrow is kept to a minimal in this show thankfully, particularly dine season 2 I have noticed potentially emotionally angst story-line are wrapped up a lot more quickly. That being said the lead playing Flash brings a great deal of vulnerability and emotional depth to the character, I actually had a lump in my throat during some of his more emotional scenes and that was thanks to the acting ability of the lead. The Iris character has toned down her level of annoyance in season 2 but I don't hold it against the actress as she has limited material to work with. The writers really need to decide what her role is because she is just a nothing character at the moment. <br/><br/>Anyhoo as I said it's a thoroughly entertaining show that doesn't take it's self to seriously so I recommend you give it a go. It's by far DC's best effort TV wise. I just want to put it out there that this show is absolutely entertaining, and I'm pretty sure that if it was completely focused on going into the science, it would be too drawn out. It works perfectly how it is, because it's not just about the science aspect of how a man can run that fast. It's a lot more optimistic and cheerful than Arrow and a lot of other shows that are on nowadays. I like how different it is.<br/><br/>I like all of the actors, and the show is really coming together. I'm excited to see where the story line is heading. I love the chemistry that Grant Gustin and Jesse L. Martin have. I also appreciate how most of the actors are fresh faces. It gives a new and exciting perspective on the show, because as we're learning about the characters, we are also learning how awesome these actors can act, and it automatically makes the show more interesting because the actors are so unpredictable. <br/><br/>I wouldn't say anyone is wrong if they don't like it, because everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but at least give it a chance, because this show has real potential. <br/><br/>Overall, this show is fun and quirky, and I really like the development that is taking place. It's quickly becoming one of my favorite TV shows. When the show first started, it pulled you in and was very good and enjoyable. After season 3ish, you clearly see the show going down hill. I slowly started paying less attention to each episode and became less interested in keeping up on episodes from week to week. They have made Iris one of the most annoying and irritating CHARACTERS. The constant she's right, she must be empowered, and her having more screen time than Barry Allen... Just STOP! The Flash series is slowly losing to the West-Allen Family Drama.
It all started with STAR Labs Team and Barry Allen who were really good at their respective technical fields. The Flash evolves and things start to land upon meta-humans, scientific inventions and time travel concepts. This is all very good for science fiction lovers. Then there comes this West-Allen family drama starting to kill the very nerve of the series. Starting with saving humanity from the meta dangers, it slowly converges to saving the West-Allen family alone. Cisco loses his brother (who cares), Caitlin loses her father the moment who becomes complete human (who cares) and the great Flash never gives a damn about travelling back to save them. But when it comes to West-Allen family members, Flash and his daughter Nora just violates the numerous time rules with time-travel back and forth as per their own will and usage (for only West-Allen family, don't forget). STAR labs finest are now puppets of Iris (just because she is wife of Barry Allen) who was initially fighting for a career in journalism. All of a sudden she is Team Leader, even suppressing the great Harrison Wells??? There are lots of things Writers lost on a big way to elevate West-Allen Family. The poor Dibny should probably look for a new team for his role to be better important.
I hope this madness of sticking to boost too much light on few characters (particularly Iris) comes to an end. The writers should think out-of the box to get the series better. Kindly don't bring back Nora again.. please please..!!<br/><br/>"I am Barry Allen.. .... I am the fastest man alive to save West-Allen Family. I am the Flash" Gradually reducing the quality of the show over the years until the audience doesn't care about it anymore. Like all the other Arrowverse shows, the scripts are corny.<br/><br/>Unlike the others - & not in a good way - it's repetitive: the "big baddie" of most seasons is an evil speedster. Why? Yes, Barry can run fast so.... does that mean the main villain has to be someone who runs fast?<br/><br/>The show has its' intentionally amusing moments. Unfortunately there aren't many stand-out or majorly exciting storylines.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the show more in its' early days but yeh: it's got repetitive. After 5 seasons i am still loving it. Hope it goes on for another 5 seasons. I really hope they don't end it with Crisis on infinite earths. Its the only show i really look forward too The show is abysmal. Season 1 included because of the last few episodes ("Black hole is just a tornado just stronger" - seriously ? ). The amount of stupidity ,irregularities and inconsistencies is enormous. <br/><br/>Should avoid at all cost. The 8* rating was probably payed well.
Also forced mixing it with other shows (Arrow) is just irritating, as well as the idiotic "alien" sub plots. I admire people that actually voted more than 7 and aren't doing it as a job. Their brains are on a 24/7 vacation. I was really into this show. Loved it. Everything was going pretty good and interesting until they ruined the show with unbelievably cringe, boring and annoying acting by Candice Patton or as we all know the worst Iris West. Haven't even watched any episode of season 4. Already heard she has become more annoying. I just love this show. It's amazing sci-fi, I love the action in this show, I love IRIS :D , I love everything. I really recommend this. Although some episodes are just plain nonsense, because nothing happens in them, rest of them are perfect. I also like that Flash is part of The Arrowverse, so there are crossovers with Arrow, Supergirl, Legends of tomorrow. I'm not sure about season 4 after seeing ending of season 3. I just hope they will not ruin the show. I was hooked to the season 1, 2 and even 3, 4 but then it gets boring. Liked the action and the concept. Though I do not prefer this kind of genre but then also it was enjoyable. Earlier I would have given the rating as 8 or 9 but as it gets really difficult to watch in later season, I am restricting my self to 6. I am three seasons in, so this is obviously only going to be a review of those seasons. This is the show about Barry Allen who becomes the flash due to an industrial accident at Star Labs. He is taken under the wing of the guy that owns the facility, Dr. Henry Wells. With the assistance of the two people that still remained behind after the lab was shut down, Cisico Ramon and Dr. Caitlin Snow, they coax Barry along as he discovers his powers and how to best use them to combat crime. He is also helped out by his foster dad Joe West and his foster sister/love interest (what?) Iris West. So there is the premise of the show. Without getting into a crap ton of spoilers, let's say what started out great and with a lot of potential was rapidly flushed down the toilet. Each season seems to have a different version of Dr. Wells, can not say more without spoilers, and it is up to the viewer as to whether he is trustworthy. The writers are all over the place here as well. One minute the team is all mad at Barry and then the next show comes on and without any resolution everyone loves everyone else. There are multiple recycled ideas and it just gets to the point where it seems like if you have seen one episode you have seen them all. Do not even get me started on how they handle the paradoxes of time travel. These people jump through time like it is a trivial thing. I am not kidding when i say its trash.They are all great actors,but the script is awfully bad.Please get some new writters and remove Iris,she just ruins the whole show!!!The story is always predictable and boring.Nothing exciting and new.Barry gets defeted in the beginning and then gets a speech from one of the members in team flash and beats the villain.WOW so exciting!!!! I don't know why the writers have taken the direction they have this season. They've taken an action oriented superhero show and turned it into a soap opera. And a dreary one at that. The major part of this episode was taken up with the characters grieving over the anticipated death of the Flash. (This shouldn't be a spoiler as all the previous episodes this seasons have been centered on this expectation.)<br/><br/>I guess some viewers enjoy all the emoting, but I find it boring.<br/><br/>Contrast this season of the The Flash with its sister show, Arrow. Arrow has been pulling out all stops in its final season, and is really exciting!<br/><br/>I sure wish Eric Wallace would go back to what made The Flash a great show in the past and make it a a superhero adventure again. I think the Smallville comparison is pretty apt. The (young) Flash is full of cheesy dialog, obvious plots and bad physics, but it's still kind of fun if you look past that. Which for me is kind of hard. The science jargon is annoying for anyone in the fields of physics, computers, or biology, but that's par for the course in most shows today. For example, they claim that he runs faster than the speed of sound, but then say he runs ~300 mph, less than half that of sound. No one can see him when he runs (except us, of course) and he can apparently snatch people up at those speeds without injury. Hopefully the show will get better. There's way too many emotional breakdowns and pep-talks that ruin what could otherwise be a really great show. There are inconsistencies with how time works, some things vanish when the past timelines change, some things remain like memories and journals? There's a lot of inconsistencies/inaccuracies with the speed flash can move vs objects he needs to catch up with which kind of sucks a lot. Still entertaining if you speed through the irrational emotional nonsense and other flaws. Am a new fan and recently watched a few episodes which made me very curious about the series. And since then I watch one season after the other and I'm really excited about the series. It has awesome actors my favorite is the flash actor he's just awesome. The series has in my opinion real addictive potential. I'm a fan from Germany and I'm looking forward to the other seasons I have not seen. So from me there are full 10 points and many more stars.<br/><br/>I'm a huge fan of the Flash series, which I already wrote in September. However, the first crossover episodes are due soon on Crisis on Infinite Earths and Flash seems to have to die. I have read articles after article but that only totally confuses. It's called Flash dies then again he could not die or Arrow dies so slowly I'm totally confused. What I also read that possibly Wally West alias Kid Flash should replace him so that would be for me the worst thing the authors or whoever could do with CW, because this stupid Kid Flash does not fit for me as a leader of this great team. So that does not work !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Waiting for the resolution, which probably comes only in mid-January 2020, makes me crazy. So then I thought to myself there are many earths and many flashes, then maybe another flash could sacrifice itself and save our flash with it, but unfortunately that's just my opinion. But who knows how many flashes he has told that they must have died. Something similar I've also read before, because unfortunately I'm in the wait totally bad.<br/><br/>Of course, I fervently hope that Flash does not have to die, because you do not necessarily have to go 100% after the comics. Of course that's my opinion. One more thing, there is only one guy who can do Flash and that's Grant Gustin. He is and will be the only one, that's probably because I'm a big fan of his. One thing is for sure, that if Grant Gustin should not be in Flash anymore than Flash, the series is finished for us. It would be a pity but for me it would not be the same anymore and I think a few people agree that there is only one Flash in the series !!!!!!
So after a long letter I wish you much fun while watching this incredible and impressive series and wish you all the best greetings from Konstanz fans on Lake Constance in Germany :) :) :) I've been watching this show from the beginning and it's clear to see the writers fatigue that's blighting this season by season.<br/><br/>Our recent 'Villain' is laughable with the actor's delivery being just growling his words and looking constipated. (Maybe that's how they defeat him - give him a laxative.)<br/><br/>Our main character is now so soppy & wet as to be utterly ineffective and his sister-wife is equally as useless. All she does is whine and cries almost every episode. (Side note : marrying his Sister!? Seriously...!! Adopted or not - that's just weird)<br/><br/>The addition of Nora is painful to endure. The character (not the actor, mind) makes each episode a chore. The supporting characters are under utilized and badly written to the level of being so pointless you wonder why they even stay...<br/><br/>So all in all I'm giving this a very low mark.
It used to be higher but the prognosis for The Flash is a terminal case of malnourished writing. It's doomed beyond the next season unless they radically shake things up a bit. Shame.
(In my opinion). Keep it up. My entire family loves The Flash! There is a great flow and I love the development of the characters. The crossover episodes are amazing as well! It's amazing how they go from fast pace to slowing it right down the following episode. You'd think that would kill it but they do it in a way to keep you wanting more. Was pretty good. Then season 4 came. I hated season 4 it was bad. Let me start with good point: operators, CGI and designers. Bad points: no logic at all. Where are all the money and high-tech supplies are coming from? This guy just blown up whole city. He must spend his time in courts. Where are the toilets in the meta-human prison cells where you don't have even a chair or bed? What are they eating? Why guys discovered AI right in their facility and never used that, especially if it can show you the future? How the Flash can catch the bullets but miss the punches and kicks? Why he did not just disarm usual humans and make them hit him for no reason with cold and fire guns? why the police didn't make any moves to neutralize the criminals? Why the Flash did not just take off a bow and arrows while he was running around the Arrow?<br/><br/>The logic in this show is bigger than "black hole" in last episode of the season 1. The Black Hole which you can "close" by running around it. I am not talking about even the pale shadow of something close to real physics and science. I am talking about logic! I enjoy watching THE FLASH.. Once I got to season 2 when berry lost his powers then gets them back. Then Joe's son aka KID FLASH come out was probably THE WORST PERSON TO PICK. I CANT STAND HIM BEING IN THE SHOW. He isn't a good actor at all. I REALLY HOPE HE Isn't IN THE UP Coming SEASONS . GET HIM OUT. From the beginning I enjoyed this show. Yes there were a lot of CGI issues and stupid moments but I can let that slide. But, so many issues with character development and the story itself keeps ruining this show. Especially Iris! I hate her and hate how she's the most annoying character in the show. She is the very dumb, bad actor, and just makes me so angry that berry loves her. Out of everyone in the show. Why her?? Overall, still a good she to watch. The acting in this is painful to watch. The cast is horrible. Boring and unappealing. The plot and dialogue are just embarrassing. Who is watching this? I assume the same guys watching Arrow/Glee. It's seems to be written for very simple people with a certain expectation and that isn't talent. I can only hope this show ends up being canceled to make room for something worthwhile. I honestly have no idea how Berlanti is able to keep getting shows out. Perhaps it's just a lack of good idea's in TV right now so Berlanti is just in the right place at the right time. Seriously cringey show, as is Arrow. My advice is don't waste your time and intelligence watching this. Hopefully this only last one season. I never reviewed any title before. but for this one i felt the need to come down here and do it. i cant believe what this show turned into. i just watched episode 19 of season 6 and i was asking myself "What IS THIS ?!". it looks like they are making this show for 6years old kids. i would rate 0 if i could. 1 is too much for this. The show just doesn't have the impact that it use to have. The action like most of the DC shows falls on the supporting cast while the person the show i named after takes a backseat. No longer enjoyable. Is the point of a television show to entertain?<br/><br/>Yes? That's what i thought too.<br/><br/>But apparently the D.C. Comics Television shows are created to send social and cultural messages so strong, clumsy, and cliche, all sense of entertainment is drowned out by an overwhelming sense of preaching from a soap-box.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor: If you want to watch ENTERTAINING Superheros on T.V., watch the Marvel shows on Netflix. How many innocent people, and friends, have to die, before you take the gloves off? How many of the people you swore to protect have to be killed, before you decide that this villain, Devoe, has to be stopped permanently, one way or another?<br/><br/>You're a superhero, so you can't kill. Great, I understand. That's a general rule of being a superhero. There is always another way. Except that this guy, this sociopath who keeps getting away because you hold back, keeps killing people. So is that being a hero? You won't kill the bad guy, because killing is wrong of course. Yet you're fine if that bad guy's body count grows?<br/><br/>I have stopped watching. I can't stand seeing the same people make the same decisions every show, and people die. I'm a huge fan of Flash the iconic comic super hero. I grew up collecting the series marveling at the best DC comic and with out a doubt the best villains in any comic, the rogues where great. Comics where about superhero outwitting and outsmarting these rogues. Romance played about 2% of the story line. However Flash has finally met his super villain arch enemy who is destroying him episode by episode. The villain is non other than the politically correct Mills and Boon romance sitcom boring CW producers. They have successfully emasculated a superhero, introduced politically correct relationships and changed the genre from villain pitted against superhero to a wimpish all in the family drama romance drivel. More people know Flash's identity in 3 series than was revealed in decades of comic sagas. Its a wonder he still wears a mask. Take away the costume and your left with a average sitcom that pales against "Days of our Lives" this has its fair share of poor acting and a worse support cast. A cast that somehow manages to get reborn into the series constantly as a new superhero (not) lol. Really?! Watch Netflix i say - Daredevil rocks. This is too sad and no worth the cost of Kleenex. Grant Gustin played the flash very well supported by very good cast like Tom Cavanagh as Harrison Wells, Jesse Martin as Joe, Tom Felton as Julian in season 3 etc. John Wesley Shipp who played flash in TV series(of 1990) is cast as Barry's father and also as first flash which is nostalgic for CBS series fans.(he played Barry Allen in CBS's flash)<br/><br/>flash really worth watching, both seasons had twists and turns especially first season was bang on! Tom Cavanagh played Harrison wells greatly but at first his H. R.(Earth-19) was awful. <br/><br/>Recommended to watch full season before negative comments!!! (some minor inconsistencies one can't ignore are inability to avoid punches from slow villains like Tony Woodward while beating fastest opponents)<br/><br/>Enjoy And keep running. Cheers!!! I should have known it was too good to be true. Seasons 1 and 2 of THE FLASH (2014-?) were among the best seasons of ANY superhero show I've ever seen, as good as or better than the best seasons of it's beloved predecessor 'Smallville'. And it's interesting because The Flash, for better or worse, reminds me of Smallville a lot. Unfortunately, the worst part of Flash, namely the character Iris West, completely reminds me of the worst part of Smallville, namely Lana Lang. And the big difference is that while Lana eventually left Smallville, thereby proving the addition by subtraction principle and the show flourishing in her absence, unfortunately it's become painfully obvious that Iris West is going to remain on The Flash until the end of the series, which may come sooner than later based on it's fast deterioration since the first 2 great seasons. <br/><br/>Seasons 1 and 2 were so awesome, just almost perfect writing and storytelling: invigorating action sequences, entertaining stories, and (mostly) lovable characters supported by witty, funny, strong writing. It was during these seasons that the series was built upon the incredible chemistry of the Team Flash of Barry Allen (Grant Gustin), Caitlin Snow (Danielle Panabaker), Joe West (Jesse L. Martin), Cisco Ramone (Carlos Valdes), and Harrison Wells (Tom Cavanagh). This team had perfect synergy, always having each other's backs, supporting each other, establishing strong bonds, and working together like a well-oiled machine. THEN it began to slowly deteriorate once the writers decided to focus more on Iris West (played dubiously by the overrated Candace Patton). <br/><br/>Iris has always been a bland, lackluster character on this series to me. But at least in the first two seasons, she generally never got in the way of the story, so it flowed much better than it has in Seasons 3 and 4. Season 3 was written specifically as a plot to try and make Iris relevant and likable and it backfired. Instead, it showcased her sheer ineptitude and uselessness to the narrative. She was in every other scene just stating the obvious and spewing out pep talks to Barry. WestAllen in their own way is as bad and pathetic as Clana was on Smallville where Iris disrupts Barry's life and potential as much as Lana did Clark. By Season 3, Barry is so obsessed this girl that he can't see straight and has been reduced to a rather selfish, lazy hero, which he wasn't in the first 2 seasons. I honestly believe the downfall of this series is because of Iris.<br/><br/>Season 3 was a train wreck, just boring episode after boring episode with Iris glued to Barry's hip and every other episode ending with some makeout session in their new apartment. Iris is in StarLabs every episode for no reason, never at her actual reporting job, which she got under suspicious circumstances. Barry's creation of Flashpoint really ruined everything, but being with Iris makes him even worse because she ignores his mistakes, makes everything about her and their boring love story, which has the most shaky foundation of any love story I've ever seen. Raised in the same home with Iris thinking of Barry as her "brother" for years, then through Barry essentially stalking her and forcing his feelings on her through them being a couple in alternate realities and other Earths, Iris decides to just make herself love him. I don't buy it. Season 3 was a more "serious" season with boring and/or stupid filler episodes, including the Grodd episodes, that cheesy musical episode, and that stupid filler amnesia episode, and a lame CGI-infested villain Savitar. And Season 4 is even worse with the dumbing down of Team Flash, Iris being continually forced into the narrative, and stupid humor to overcompensate for how awful Season 3 was. And it's all because of ONE terrible character, Iris West, that the writers have let this happen. And I think no matter what they do going forward, it's too late. The Flash is not only one of the most brilliant new shows of 2014, it is an incredible step up for superheroes on television with more powerful actions, characters, and style than Man of Steel offered. The Flash is extraordinary. Barry Allen gets struck not just by lightning, but by an opportunity to redeem himself after a life of being left aside and pushed around. With his skills he manages to find more people like him that abuse their new powers for violence and crime. Along with the help of Caitlin Snow, Cisco Ramon, and Dr. Harrison Wells the flash battles the power possessed criminals that are out to destroy Cental City. We also can't forget about our friends in the police force Joe West and Eddie Thawne at the front of every crime. It's time for the Flash to run its way into television history. I couldn't keep watching its first episode completely. It is very childish and has lack of realism in very basic aspects. <br/><br/>This is my first review here, and the disappointment by watching it made me to write a review here. <br/><br/>Please stop making these kind of stuff!!! They should warn to watch -18 people. <br/><br/>How is that, the guy was in coma for 9 months, but he is shaved and has makeup already!!!<br/><br/>Even the face of actors is unrealistic. If this was a movie, i might be watched it. It is very disappointing. While superhero movies usually are unrealistic, but they always try to make you believe what they are saying. <br/><br/>The flash, starts by every things that are not believable even in a dream. I hope, we will see much better works in the years ahead. I saw the pilot episode tonight with my sister and we can both agree this blew our expectations out of the water. This is coming from polar opposites; a comic buff and a casual just trying to catch a decent show after work. <br/><br/>The effects were movie-esque, stunning for a TV-show especially when compared to its predecessors(Smallville's Flash 10 years ago as well as the 90s Flash TV series 25 years ago). The acting is fantastic and on point. Gustin, although he doesn't look the part, is an incredibly charming Barry Allen. The support cast is great, for the most part.<br/><br/>Won't go into too much detail, but what won me over was the honesty to the comics while all the same adding in original characters and plot so that it leaves long-time fans surprised as well. The back story and power origins are near exactly how it was in the source material(the comics), CW did not streamline it to make it "more realistic" or "less cheesy". The first episode reveals that they will not limit Barry's abilities. Where Arrow will be their more realistic street-crime TV series, the Flash will have him up against his super-powered comic villains. This may not seem that important to the average viewer, but I'm in tears of joy to see an awesome character done right.<br/><br/>Plot: 10/10 Acting/Casting: 9/10 Atmosphere: 10/10<br/><br/>Final score: 9.66, repeating of course I am just very disappointed. I think the ages of the characters really detracted from the general believability. I would have really preferred someone who looked more in their early thirties than someone... like they cast. This is just Flash Smallville. We have already done this before. If you liked Smallville and want Smallville only with The Flash... then sure. But if you were looking for something new and fresh, then this will be tired.<br/><br/>I really preferred the Barry Allen who played him in the 1990 series that was canceled well before it should have... But I guess it was nice seeing him as his dad... It just... ug.<br/><br/>I really felt that if it wasn't for the amazing special effects, there would be nothing holding this series at all. This show continues to have a great plot and great character development throughout every season and is the true definition of a superhero show This is one of the most pointlessly stupid show I've ever seen. The concept wouldn't be too bad but in reality the show is repeating the exact same bullcrap: Someone doesn't love me, let's change the time line. Oh, I broke everything, I must fix them now. Many people die but it's finally fixed. Oh, someone still doesn't love me, let's change the time line again. Oh, It's even more fcked up than before. Let's fix it again -even more people dies-. huh, finally the bad guy is dead. Wait.. the girl still doesn't love me, let's do it again. I've been meaning to check out The Flash for a long time and lamented that it has never made its way to free to air television in Australia. It's been everywhere else but I've had the misfortune to miss out. Finally in December last year I was able to get my hands on Season 1 on Blu-Ray and right from the very first episode, I'd found myself a winner. Every episode was enjoyable to start to finish and I was thrilled to see Grant Gustin perfectly fit into the red suit as The Flash.<br/><br/>Central City Forensic Police Investigator Barry Allen (Grant Gustin) finds himself blessed with the power of running at super speed following a freak accident which sees him struck by lightening following a massive particle accelerator accident which affected most of Central City and its citizens. Some citizens were blessed/cursed with unusual metahuman powers, and others were killed or seriously injured. Adopting his alternate identity as The Flash, he is taken under the wing of a group of scientists at S.T.A.R Labs led by the Dr Harrison Wells (Tom Cavanagh) and fellow scientists Cisco Ramon (Carlos Valdes) and Caitlin Snow (Danielle Panabaker). Barry Allen must keep his new found metahuman powers a secret from Detective Joe West (Jesse L. Martin) and Barry's childhood friend Iris West (Candice Patton) who took Barry in as a young age after his father Henry Allen (John Wesley Shipp) was falsely imprisoned after the murder of Barry's mother Nora Allen (Michelle Harrison) 14 years ago.<br/><br/>Grant Gustin nails it perfectly as Barry Allen/The Flash. Breathing life into the famed comic book character, the TV series has brought upon a new legion of fans who have barely sighted The Flash apart from the various comic books, cartoons, and the short lived TV series in the early 1990's where John Wesley Shipp donned the iconic red tights.<br/><br/>The best thing about The Flash is that is highly entertaining and lets the audiences sit back and enjoy the fun. Kids and adults alike can get in on the fun as well. I've found a greater appreciation of The Flash and I'm looking forward to see the movie when it hits cinemas in 2018 and this time Ezra Miller will don the famed red tights.<br/><br/>I've been looking forward to watching The Flash and without having high expectations, it was definitely well worth it. The Flash has been a long overdue (and well deserved) addition to the list of TV series that I enjoy watching.<br/><br/>9/10. The team behind The Flash, aka The Barry "White-Bread" Allen Show couldn't write an engaging character or storyline even if they were getting paid millions to do so. Oh wait. Spare the braincells and give this a big fat miss. This show is great. While not as great as Agengts of Shield, it is still one of the best superhero shows on air. I never thought the CW could make a show as good as Smallville was, but this show may prove me wrong. It has a lot of tie-ins with Arrow that helps build the CW's DC universe.If you like comic book shows then this show will give you everything you want. A lot of easter eggs for the die hard comic fans, good special effects for a TV show. Nice pace of action/humor, and it doesn't change things to much from the comic. For fans of Arrow this show is a great spin off that tops the show it was spun from. <br/><br/>It is not to dark and gritty and stays very light hearted so that it is something that young and old viewers can enjoy. Some shows get a little to violent or complex to where little kids that love comic characters cant enjoy, but this show is great fun for the whole family. This was my favorite show when its season 1 and 2. Now its never. Everybody has superpowers. Characters lots their free and relax personality and become more boring. promoting gay things . not interest to watch.And will never watch again I think, first two seasons were good, but at the third season was totally disappointment because SAVATAR were killed by the bullet, " savatar who was the fastest speedster then anyone more speed than zoom and the flash and killed by the bullet, what the fish and what?, I just started the four season then first minutes cisco and kid flash was abducted by womon because of a gun. totally out of logic. I merely don't understand. what is director doing about all this? To sum up all three seasons, relationships, drama with a few interesting moments and then more drama and then drama again. In the end, the series gets high jacked by political correctness so it can continue on with it's lunacy. After a while almost everyone is a super hero, leaving no room for anything normal. This show really goes off the deep end like the writers were on some drug or even a LOT of drugs. <br/><br/>Also, it is easy to know what is going to happen during an episode. Drama, flash meets new bad guy/girl, drama, loses to bad guy/girl, drama, regroups with team, drama, comes back and captures/disposes of bad guy/girl with sporadic cameos from other linking super hero TV shows, drama.<br/><br/>I would recommend passing this one up. I've in the past heard about the flash series coming on TV and was hoping that it would bring some good material. Oh how wrong I was.<br/><br/>The pilot of the show was just plain horrible, everything was speeded through, if you didn't understand something, then well, too bad for you. The story is so predictable and was repeated so many times that it's simply laughable. The storyline is so predictable and old that it couldn't be more. Murdered father, bullied as a kid, troublesome love life, seems familiar? Then comes the acting, another fail of this show. Characters are underdeveloped, everything is rushed and sometimes it just doesn't make sense. What also doesn't make sense are the Flashes powers. How fast is he really? Sometimes he freezes time and he works at normal speed. Then the other time he can barely outrun the Mist villain or dodge a bullet. It's so inconsistent that the head hurts. Also the physics are thrown out the window completely, so it's hard to watch it sometimes. What is also stupid is the part when the flash can't tell her "best friend" his true identity, not to mention the cliché that the person he loves is his greatest admirer. <br/><br/>All in all, the show is just awful. Bad acting, boring story, inconsistency, stupid dialogs.. Only thing that it's good enough is the production of the video and it's the only thing that makes it watchable for me. I don't know why this has such ratings on IMDb, I wouldn't give more than 6 on the best days. I guess if your American that it's good enough for you. I used to like this show but it's clear they're pushing an agenda. I used to really like the Flash, but these days there are no stakes, every story just gets dragged out and there is no more real interesting character development for the main characters. The reveals and twists and the good villains from the first few seasons are gone, and replaced with bad guys we don't care about, repeats of old stories and things we can see coming from a mile away. Also some of the characters are starting to get on my nerves, especially Joe with his "father figure speech" trope. Ugh, enough! And all the new characters we're supposed to get excited for because they were in the comics... I don't care, I don't even read comics and I just want to watch a tv show! If this show doesn't get better very very soon, I'm done. I don't usually write negative reviews, if I start disliking a show I normally just stop watching, but here I'm so disappointed because this used to be one of my favorite tv shows... The series follows the life of Barry Allen after he becomes the flash, it shows everything he has to go through to save his city, including, personal relationships.<br/><br/>The first two seasons were the best, strong villain, strong character development, amazing stories and an even better narrative.<br/><br/>The other seasons have been a bit too predictable, a pretty simple villain, and a lot of Iris, I mean, I like Iris, from the comics, but the writers really don't know what to do with her since the second season and that has hurt the series a lot.<br/><br/>But, although it has lost plenty of good narrative and character development, specially with villains, this series continues to amaze by it's compelling visual effects, acting and stories. Characters are amazing, story is great and understanding, goof family show too It will probably end in season 9 or ten but I hope it lasts the same time as supernatural Bad acting, bad dialogue, bad writing (very bad), cheap, lame, bad directing. i couldnt bare more than a few episodes, it was just too mind numbing. theres nothing to this show. its just empty.. no idea what people loved so much about it, lol.................... The Good:<br/><br/>Effects are really good.<br/><br/>Music is also good<br/><br/>Storyline is interesting and twisted nicely.<br/><br/>The Bad: First off, very awful acting. Dialogues are very cliché and unnatural. I feel like someone is reading a book when I am watching this. Definitely the series is targeted for the general audience specially teenagers. It's one of the top 10 TV series that shows almost all of the puberty problems that you won't care to watch. Example is how he likes his best friend and don't know how to tell her, self- pity, daddy issues that you keep hearing all through out the season which makes little impact due to bad acting and predictable lines. What I hated the most is the very cheesy, very annoying punchline at the start of every episode, how is it possible to have that kind of narration without anyone cringing? Because for the life of me I cannot understand how anyone over the age of 13 can find this show good in any way. I mean... cliché after cliché after cliché followed by horrendous dialog, unlikable characters, and a very dumb portrayal of the comic hero Flash. There is nothing good to note about this show. The plots are beyond dumb and remind me of 1980s cartoons... Mind you, I love some 1980s cartoons but many were very bad and were intended to do only one thing, and that was to sell toys thus no thought actually went into the shows themselves. This, on the other hand, is a fully funded stand alone show... whats their excuse such poor writing and worse plots?<br/><br/>I definitely believe that most of the positive reviews on this site are paid for. There is no way that this many people like it. I am a nerd myself and I have about 5k comics to prove it. All my friends are nerds too. None of us can watch this show. I'm astonished at the proliferation of high praise for this series. They took a charming cast playing likable characters and ran it into the ground with an onslaught of plot holes and an intolerable inconsistency, with respect to the powers Flash displays. <br/><br/>I'll start with the good: <br/><br/>I really loved the characters in this show. I found the evolving relationship between Barry and his foster father Joe (expertly played by Jesse L. Martin) to be very touching. There were a couple exchanges between them that miraculously coincided with some dust getting in my eyes, causing them to water. I enjoyed many of the other characters nearly as much.<br/><br/>Now for the bad:<br/><br/>Leaving aside the utter lack of physics, which should be glaringly obvious to anyone who passed 8th grade science, I'll focus on the show's inconsistencies:<br/><br/>In some episodes, the flash has trouble with his clothing catching on fire due to the immense friction with the air he generates from running so fast. In one case, he sets a girl down after carrying her along with him at super speed, and she has to quickly tear her shirt off as it had caught fire. Yet in many other episodes, the people he takes with him have no such problems at all. I can only guess they wanted an excuse to put a pretty girl wearing a bra in front of the camera. (not to mention the fact that he accelerates from 0-500mph in about a second...which would be fatal for anyone he was "rescuing")<br/><br/>Another glaring example is that in some instances, he is fast enough to dodge bullets and electrical discharges like a character from the matrix but in others, he is unable to dodge a punch from someone who doesn't even have enhanced speed. Human punch: ~25mph. Speed of light: 670,000,000mph. <br/><br/>I don't want to sound like I'm being nit picky but the discrepancies are so blatant it's nearly impossible to ignore them and I find myself rolling my eyes in almost every episode. I think one of the key's to enabling an audience to suspend their disbelief in any kind story, but particularly in this genre (fantasy, sci-fi, superhero) is to remain realistic and logical, relative to whatever rules exist for the fantasy world the story is set in. The Flash fails to do this in spectacular fashion. <br/><br/>I wanted to love this show and despite all my problems with it, I did finish the whole season. I liked the characters and the story enough that I was able to get through it, aforementioned eye rolls notwithstanding. It's my hope they'll put some more thought into this for the next season as this has the potential to be a good series. When I saw the pilot I was actually positively surprised how well they integrated the Flash on a TV setting that can't rely on big budget effects like they have in the movies and also the story was not too bad, however it went downhill from there. It's a lot like Smallville at the beginning, with a monster of the week setup and a small overall story arc. But the dialogs are just unimaginative and really corny, in fact so corny that I find myself cringing threw them or skipping these parts of the episode all together. I don't mind that they have this teeny stuff going on, since CW has to cater a bit to it's usual audience, but they always talk about the same thing and it's a lot worse than it ever was on Smallville or Arrow. Also they opened up too many small plot holes during the first few episodes so that I'm losing interest really fast. Too bad, it could have been a nice addition to the already great comic line-up on TV, but imo it's the weakest of all. The show literally repeats itself over and over EACH SEASON right down to what plot point happens in each episode. Fastest man alive. Oop! Someones faster! Fight random one episode villains for like 18 episodes. Battle with season villain. Flash wins but someone dies. They come back from a different universe. Dont bother with the show The Flash is a PG-Rated spin-off of The Arrow, and one of the strongest comic-book television programs. The first few episodes of the first season may seem a little childish with the whole "villain of the week", a new metahuman for each episode. But it gets better starting from episode 7, episode 15 being the best, as it gets more suspenseful and mysterious with Dr. Wells and his suspicious acts. SEASON 1 SPOILER AHEAD!! If you are reading this review wondering if you should continue with the show with season 2, mainly because your like me, and the last episode of season 1 doesn't really make sense because if Eddie died, Reverse-Flash never existed, the particle accelerator never went off, and no one had powers, not even The Flash, then read the rest of this review. Eddie died. Reverse-Flash (Eobard Thawne/Harrison Wells) never existed. Harrison (Eobard) didn't sett off the particle accelerator. There's no such thing as metahumans, no such thing as "The Flash". Barry's mom is alive, and he's just a normal guy. So how the heck does the Flash still exist to stop the black hole? My theory - Eddie is somehow still alive. This is all fake, Eobard is still out there, which will probably be explained at the end of season 2. Watch the show. Both seasons. It gets better and better. I've watched this show since episode one and I really like it. But as the seasons go on and there are all these different Wells characters from different Earths it gets annoying because they are all super annoying. I can't take all of the cheesy accents. Especially this seasons Sherloque. He's the absolute worst! If you like teenage-TV, you will like this.<br/><br/>This series is childish both in acting and visuals. I would consider it somewhat like twillight and transformers. Some older kid is the hero, and there is no brutal reality included. The doctor, the engineer, the scientist, the journalist, almost all are just old kids no more than 22... Even the oh SOO evil villain is a kid, just with a false looking frown, black clothes and a leather jacket.<br/><br/>The effects are high quality, like the previously mentioned films. Unfortunately this is not enough to save the show. The acting is goofy to say at least. IT is a typical hero, trying to make funny comments, fighting the bad guy, saving the girl.<br/><br/>Three is nothing new or exciting in the show. Why it has gotten above 8 is a testament to peoples lack of taste. Most of "The Flash"'s viewers are fans from the show "Arrow". Barry Allen, the main character of "The Flash" was featured in "Arrow" which prompted me to watch the first episode of this series. Honestly, I really liked Barry in "Arrow". He was sorta witty, very awkward, and was a male version of Arrow's Felicity. However, when I watched this show, I was expecting something different. I had high hopes (I'm a big DC Comics fan) and with Arrow running season 3 strong, I figured "The Flash" would be a good way to pass my time. I however, was greeted with instant Arrow and Smallville. If I tried, I'd probably be able to pull quotes out from both shows, just in the first episode. The striking resemblance to Arrow, ie. the cop, the cop's daughter, being in love with the cop's daughter who doesn't want to be with the main character, the smart computer girl, and the hero spree of wanting to "change the city". Not only do they feature Green Arrow (thanks for making me switch to another series to find out what Barry said to Oliver IN ARROW. Honestly doesn't make much sense.) They sorta undermined him.<br/><br/>"You can be the hero I can't," "cool," "wear a mask".<br/><br/>I'm sorta outraged that the CW had to copy off of two shows to get a half-baked, less than decent show. And trust me, I haven't even scratched the Smallville part.<br/><br/>Smallville is the first show I watched from CW (Well, before the merged). Smallville also features an Oliver Queen (Green Arrow), a Flash, And an Aquaman. And Superman, of course. Clark Kent came to Earth in a meteor-storm, which affected the inhabitants of Smallville and surrounding areas by giving them super-powers, or mutations. Clark, feeling responsible, tried to help out best as he could. He was gonna help everybody cause he had powers and could help...<br/><br/>Wow, "The Flash", sound familiar?<br/><br/>So we have a Arrow story, with a Sherlock-main character, with a Smallville motive, what's next? Are they gonna ask the Doctor for the TARDIS? (We all saw the date on that newspaper).<br/><br/>Also, first episode and how many people know? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... And he's not too discrete either.<br/><br/>I give it a 5/10. 2 points for effort, 2 again cause it had a good boost in "Arrow", and 1 point for attempted acting.<br/><br/>Effects are okay, not too shabby, but a little over-the-top.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend watching "Arrow" or "Smallville", instead.. Or do what I do, turn the volume off and just look at Barry's face. It's sorta manageable. The flash started ok, but over time went down hill, maybe they are looking for a 5-12 yr old audience, DC could be up there with marvel if they leave the MeToo, LGBTQ, alone and make them family friendly shows, and keep true to the original comics, the Green Arrow was the only real comic book story that was good, Iris is becoming so annoying and the baddies just appear and go without any long term villians true to the comic, so sad DC IDK what happened to the show. It was great when it started and fun to watch with all the cool stuff they did. Now, it's just going after unimportant things and pointless dialogues with many actors either doing too much or not enough.
The focus of the whole show should've mostly been on the character it is named after, but no, because they wanna give the viewers a taste of many heroes in one show. It is fine to give other characters some screentime but taking the story too wayward is just costing them the loss of audience.
The acting has downgraded too. It's okay to replace actors if they aren't doing well. We need some good performances on the screen and not just a few face expressions going on with every emotion. There are a few good actors too, but even they can't carry the whole show on their shoulders.
The costumes and gadgets are getting ridiculous too. Those memes on the internet about them, dude! They should put some thinking into the show and improve the quality of their VFX and on screen presentation of the show.
In Season 6's Episode 10, the new intro was cool, but the episode was garbage and according to me (as I have been following it since the beginning) one of the worst episodes of The Flash. It was more of The Iris rather than The Flash. There were much expectations from this show but... The episode made me write this review because I have reached the limit of my patience. The series itself is descent at the beginning, but it loses itself in timetravel, dimensions and all kind of nonsense. They had a good ending at season 2, they should have stopped there! Everything about this show is spot on....action, drama, comedy. Nothing over the top. The relationships between the characters. Need at least 10 seasons out of this. Grant Gustin would have made an excellent addition to the feature films. Awesome Show and I love the way it is great to be with the characters I like The Flash tv series. The two reasons the tv series is good because they have a excellent background instrumental music for the Flash and the plot is very good. The cast and crew are great, and the storyline is fine, but the one thing that bothers me in the show is the excessive presence of cliches. Iris -- the one African American female featured in the show -- as the wardrobe of a common gold-digging harlot; she's supposed to be a hard-hitting reporter... a cop's daughter... not an extra for a Nicki Minaj video. Similarly, Cisco -- the one Latino featured in the show -- is a giant trap of cliches. Please, please don't get me started on "Caitlin Snow" (already one of the overly "white" female characters in the Flash/Arrow series... like Arrow's Black Sparrow). I can't get into either of these without adding spoilers, so I'll just ask the production team to work on eliminating some of the more grating Iris/Cisco cliches since it's perhaps too late to save Ms. Snow from her complicated fate. Loved this show from day 1, however some characters are becoming stale, just seem to be there for no reason. Episode are well done however starting to become repetitive. Review of Season One:<br/><br/>THE FLASH is another addition to the DC Comics universe, and very similar in scope to ARROW. However, I found this season to be slightly preferable to ARROW; it doesn't have that po-faced seriousness that ARROW has going on, and the characters are more likeable as a result. It's generally a villain of the week kind of picture, although there is a mildly engaging storyline that emerges and comes to fruition towards the climax. The performers are generally confident and ambitious, which helps a lot, although the CGI effects leave something to be desired and there's a certain constraint and repetitive nature to the action scenes due to the superhero's power and in this respect ARROW is the superior show. I was delighted to see some genre favourites, including Liam McIntyre and Clancy Brown, appearing in support.<br/><br/>Review of Season Two:<br/><br/>Season 2 is a bit of a mixed bag but still generally enjoyable. The writing isn't as strong or consistent as in the first series so it becomes more of a villain-of-the-week kind of format. Some of the other superhuman characters make fun appearances but there's a lack of good guest stars compared to the first season. The supporting cast tend to come into her own here which keeps this watchable.<br/><br/>Review of Season Three:<br/><br/>Season 3 takes a few more missteps than previously but still proves generally enjoyable. The main problem with this one is the weaker writing, with much more needless family melodrama and a lack of genuine suspense. The constant time travel storylines simply aren't as interesting as those of the previous two series, and the recasting of Wells as a comedy character becomes a little grating. By far the nadir of this season is the ridiculous song-and-dance episode complete with the bloody John Barrowman, no less; what were they thinking?<br/><br/>Review of Season Four:<br/><br/>Sadly, Season 4 proves to be the worst yet, a mish mash of ideas and tropes that never really gels. The first half of the series is pure filler as Barry gets sent to prison which doesn't really make sense when it comes to the fantasy and sci-fi elements found elsewhere. The obnoxious comedy with Harry's alter egos and the endless romantic elements drag the pacing down considerably. The inclusion of the bendy guy is ridiculous and not helped by appalling CGI effects. The series' villain is a predictable chap borrowed from Marvel and the final element a simple MATRIX copy with more bad FX. A shame that a once-promising show is now becoming so tedious. Actors seem to be struggling with continually bad writing. Contrived plot twists, overly convenient plot devices, stunted and uncomfortable dialog. Actors are not great.<br/><br/>Seems like the studio assigned the C team to this one. Actually manages to make The Arrow look decent and that shows is really not good at all. Of the DC shows, maybe only Legends is worse. Not sure why all of the DC based shows are so bad. Other reviewer have pointed out the fact that iris is somehow in charge. This alone make every episode harder to watch because of her commanding demeanor. Ralph dying was going to happen I assumed but I was actually really starting to warm up to him, so disappointed there. I just think this overall has been the worst season with shotty writing and to many plot holes to name. Please better soon Flash and kick the lame bug. It's a feat of fantastic laziness to make something so brainless that it lacks even an ounce of redemption. The Flash crew is to be applauded. The Flash was pretty good, in all honesty for the first couple seasons. When the idea was fresh, and when Barry could not run insanely fast. Everything in the show is completely inconsistent, from his reaction speed to basic physics, to even character development. If you can care less for plotholes, give it a try. It's interesting. However, those of you who are capable of noticing these issues will find yourself screaming in anger at the ridiculousness of the show. The Flash has a lot of good moments. As a lot of shows, this one has some holes in it. The whole show takes place in central city, however, they always seem to talk about saving the world and when Zoom comes that he will try to rule the world. It doesn't seem like nobody who lives outside central city knows who any of the characters are. I would rate the show a 7 or maybe 8 if the writers either rewrote the dialogues or made our heros and villains known for the rest of the world Used to be interesting show with some unpredictable outcomes, but now its really fading away. My opinion is, that all those crossovers. Stories are getting poor and poor and with all main characters getting superpowers, show is losing it's idea. Not to mention, that all those crossovers with Supergirl and Legends drags show down as well. Hope they'll improve after break. To be honest I'm not used to writing reviews but certain circumstances forced me to.Let me start off by saying I was really hyped by the first season of the flash.I liked the Riversflash in his mystery form.On season 2, we get another speedster,Zoom who is also under a mask.In season 3,savitar also under the wraps.I ve not yet began watching the fourth season but if I see another villain hiding under a mask,I don't think I ll watch it anymore. And writers please change the genre back to superhero scifi stuff.The weird romance drama is really starting to get on my nerves.I am sure many people have complained about Iris character in the show.Its only a matter of time before people quit this show if this things don't change. One more thing..please borrow tips from Jessica Jones,daredevil,arrow sn 5 and villain.They are more fascinating. I watched the Flash pilot today. I had high expectations for this series and they delivered them. I enjoyed the pilot immensely and I cannot wait for the next episode.<br/><br/>The cast is very good. Grant Gustin portrays Barry Allen pretty well, but he's not exactly hero-like. Not yet anyway. The rest of the cast is really good, esp. Jesse L. Martin as Det. West<br/><br/>The show has plenty of potential. It's not quite Arrow yet but there's plenty of type for that.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/><br/><ul><li>Fun tone</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Good acting</li></ul><br/><br/>CONS:<br/><br/><ul><li>Somewhat cheesy dialogue but that's forgivable</li></ul><br/><br/>Overall, I rate it a 8.5/10. But I'm not rounding it up to 9 because its not a 9/10 show yet. I'll round it down to 8. THIS SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A SPIN-OFF! This is an evolution of superheroes, in the television show industry. 'Arrow' was created because WB/DC needed a product, similar to the chemistry of Batman and what better character than Oliver Queen/Green Arrow. I mean billionaire playboy becomes vigilante? Come on, in comparison Green Arrow is a lot like Batman, it's uncanny. Let alone the fact, that Oliver Queen and Bruce Wayne share a few similarities in their characters. As for 'Arrow' the show, it has the same dark, realistic feel that The Dark Knight trilogy had, (and the same can be said for Man of Steel). And I love that WB/DC are going this way about it. The show has proved it's worth for being an epic adventure for Oliver Queen and an awesome introduction to the character, as well as a kick ass TV show on it's own.<br/><br/>Though in comparison between the Flash and the Green Arrow, the Flash is a much more involved and important character than the latter, in respect to the entirety of the DC universe. By this I mean, everything in some way is connected to The Flash e.g. "The Flashpoint" story arc for instance. He has more power in his tiny red gloves, than some people give him credit for. I mean, some fans of the comic books, might even say that the Flash is more important than Superman or Batman, (even though the majority of the mainstream public, look up to these defining superheroes more). I mean the Flash brought back comic books, at a time when they were deemed inappropriate for children! I am of course, referring to the beginning of the Silver Age of comic books, which began with 'The Flash'. He was the little guy, in the midst of all these other famous superheroes like Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Captain America and The Human Torch. Yet 'The Flash' was the underdog, that inspired and defined superhero comic books and their franchises to this date.<br/><br/>Which leads me to this TV show...<br/><br/>When I first saw Grant Gustin on 'Arrow', my initial thoughts weren't exactly promising toward his acting or charisma, let alone the fact that they hired a fairly unknown actor for such a big role. But how wrong I was, he's good at playing the little guy because that's what he is and that is who Barry Allen is. He's the little guy, who inspires everybody around him and it's only now that I can see the potential that the show, Grant Gustin and this incarnation of Barry holds. For every obstacle that this Barry Allen faces and overcomes, it deems himself even more worthy to becoming the definitive live action version of 'The Flash'. I mean in episode 6, "The Flash is Born" that punch was the first time that I realised and saw that this version of Flash could very well be 'The Flash'. It looked like he was nearly flying, like the very first superhero that is 'Superman'. Grant Gustin has really grown me, I just love watching him now. He's just so lovable as his character and as an actor. So cool... So, so COOL!<br/><br/>I want this show to do so well, that WB will consider these versions of the Flash and Green Arrow to being included in the upcoming Justice League films. I mean jeez... I'm actually enjoying 'Arrow' and 'The Flash' more than 'Man of Steel'. That being said, I can't wait for 'Dawn of Justice', Ben Affleck as Batman is going to be so cool!! This opinion and want for them to include Stephen Amell and Grant Gustin in the Justice League film, stems from the reality that it's easier to create a universe in a TV show. I mean, by the time 'Dawn of Justice' comes out, Zack Snyder will only have 5 hours at best, to have shown his universe. In comparison to this, Arrow will have finished it's 4th season and The Flash will have had two seasons. By my calculations, that means that the TV show's universe will have had a total of 92 hours worth of stories and character development with a much broader universe to enjoy.<br/><br/>For me, this Flash is 'The Flash'. I really enjoy the flash! I've been hooked since the first episode the story line grabbed my attention and I look forward to the next episode each week. The only downside to the flash I find is the acting or rather the script does become corny but bearable as it doesn't last long. I'm a huge DC comics fan and love to see the inclusion of many well known villain meta-humans that are not included in the large open world game DC Universe. I hope to see Flash expand in future seasons and become as powerful as he is in the comic books. None the less Flash is an excellent series that is a must watch for those who love superheroes I absolutely love this show and I hope that it can be on TV for a long time!!! I love the graphics, CGI, animation, and the technology used to make it such a great show and make it so realistic and believable!!! I also love the mystery and suspense involved in the show it makes the show last longer, more interesting, and stable. The acting is outstanding and unbelievable I love all of the actors/actresses they do their job with stunning and amazing perfect potential!!! I just can't wait for it to come back on I will literally make this the most well known show on television I'm really gonna spread the word I just hope that the CW network and the whole Flash production company keeps up the great work because this show is definitely a huge success and in my opinion will continue to be!!! By the way did I mention I love the Flash #1ShowOnTelevision I finally have found a show to replace Smallville. It has the right amount of action with good actors and solid story lines. Love the heroes and villains. I love that they added Tom Caughlin to the cast. Not sure how I like the leading lady but the girl who plays Caitlin is a sure thing. I loved her in Sky High. A must add to your Tuesday night lineup.I was disappointed with Arrow. I was hoping they would have brought in the actor from Smallville and I hate the leading women in the show. She can NOT act. At least the characters are likable and believable. The young kid who Plays Barry/Flash is perfect like Tom Welling as Clark/Superman. I also am happy that they explained a lot in the first episode. As a child I loved all DC comics and shunned Marvel, because they just seemed silly, and continuing into the cartoon world, I have LOVED DC, I've seen all the Justice League incarnations, and the epitome of it all, Young Justice, were all brilliant.<br/><br/>Then it happened, LIVE ACTION! I was thrilled when Arrow started, and even Flash (and the gorgeous new Supergirl), but somehow, it suddenly became SUPER silly. The plots are so full of holes you could drive trucks through them. Often times things are going great and then, duh, some stupid unrealistic move makes it all fall apart. <br/><br/>The incredible inconsistencies continue, and IMO, Flash is falling apart as it goes on. The recent foray into "Earth 2" was completely ludicrous. <br/><br/>The actors are doing their job, the writers need to try to pull their own weight. Almost every ep ends the same way in my head, "that was dumb".<br/><br/>I expected far far more from you DC, but congrats, you've made me a die hard Marvel fan now, though I will hope and pray that you get the message and clean up your act. The Flash is too melancholic. Rick Cosnett, Iris boyfriend, would have been a better Flash than Grant Gustin. Iris, Flash's chief romantic interest, is kind of dimwitted and has been miscasted. She isn't right in the spot of a superhero crush. I can't see why any sane superhero would fall for her. The other characters have no personal life and are dumb(e.g. Caitlin, Cisco, The Doctor, The Detective).<br/><br/>At the end of each episode we see everybody hugging and congratulating each other on how great they are. It's annoying. It's like watching The Care Bears Show.<br/><br/>Major plot-holes, wrong cast, poorly written, The Flash is running for the Worst TV Show of the Year. This show is a total soap opera. The Flash is my favourite superhero and I could like this show, but after trying for years, I've stopped watching. The writers have such a SJW stick up their rear-end, it just sucks the fun out of everything. Not much else to say. Oh, except that they broke the whole time-line. And ruined the Grodd story-line. And the reverse flash story-line. The only cool villain in the show is Captain Cold. I joined IMDb just to write this. I started to watch this series because my cable started showing it. I remembered The Flash series from my childhood and it was awesome! I used to skip my homework just to watch it because it was 1993 and we couldn't record it.<br/><br/>Now I was excited to see the series once again but to my surprise this show is a total bullsh*t. Those fake acting, out of order scene cuts and inadequate story line (dialogues), it looks like someone is in a hurry to do this and get done with. There is no passion in this series, well technically at least and the CG effects are really really poor. I mean Indians are making better quality CG than this! No offense to anyone but this series does not deserves anything above 4.<br/><br/>Thank you. "My words, irrelevant of being meant with an intent of humor, were hurtful, and unacceptable. I am ashamed I was capable of these really horrible attempts to get attention at that time. I regret them deeply. This was not acceptable behavior. These were words I threw out at the time with no thought or recognition of the harm my words could do, and now have done today."<br/><br/>Too late, Ralphy boy. There is no gingold to make it all go away. Cancel Culture has taken your life and turned it into crap. You're not getting a job and you'll never work in this town again. It doesn't matter that this happened 10 years ago or yesterday. YOU ARE GUILTY OF WRONG THINK.<br/><br/>Worse, you are guilty of THINKING.<br/><br/>Grant Gustin wrote he was "shocked, saddened and angry when I saw the tweets. Words matter."<br/><br/>Absolutely. Words matter. That's why they're covered under the First Amendment.<br/><br/>Hollyweird doesn't care. I do. That's why you'll see other ratings on individual shows with a 10, a 9 -- but alas. These enlightened ACTORS don't see how their ACTIONS hurt the show. Season 1 : The pace of this season at starting was slow .However, the end of this season was suspenseful and full of drama.The acting of all the actors was ubelievable and breath-taking, especially of harrison wells( Eobard thawn ). 9.5 star....<br/><br/>Season 2: Not like season 1 . In this season they have introduced concept of multiverse which is to some extent was good . But, I think it should have been better if the pace of it was fast .The zoom was great villian but the plot of this season was out-track. 2 star less for it...7.5 star<br/><br/>Season 3 : Unwanted drama with same sense of defeating meta-human , who are not even necessary for this show. Barry fighting with his own self of future version .And everybody were so busy in protecting Iris that they had not given importance to other character such as HR.. Iris acting was over-dramatic. 6.5star...<br/><br/>Season 4 : Finally not a speedster. Thinker was an awesome villian .Acting of him was extremely stunning and he was able to out think everyone like cisco said .New character was introduced ralph dibny ( the elongated man) whose work was also good.The most interesting part of this season was when barry was in jail. However, the ending was little bit awkward and was not convincing. 8.5star...<br/><br/>Season 5: What was that ?... Cicada ! The stupidest villian from all the season and Nora who barely even knows what she was doing. Again Iris was given so much prefference .Get rid of him director now.....I like just ending of it , only the concept of eobard thawn , rest of them was nonsense . This season was totally waste of time....5.5star<br/><br/>Season 6: In this season something was different .Director has not shown a meta-human in each and every episode , which I like it.. I cannot come to a conclusion until its last episode .So far , Its .....9 star<br/><br/>Overall -7 ... I started watching this and I really liked season 1 but after that it was boring I have to admit for the first two seasons i binged it because it was that good to me. i enjoyed the flash discovering himself and learning the ropes of becoming a superhero while also understanding his back story.<br/><br/>and then after season 2, it went completely downhill. i don't know why or how exactly but it became less of a superhero series but more of a showy idk romance and drama and just weird??? it just didn't have the good factors that made it great in the first two seasons which is a shame. The same routine every season.<br/><br/>A: A foe turns up<br/><br/>B: The team spends all season trying to beat them and failing miserably.<br/><br/>C: A few silly episodes to relieve the tension.<br/><br/>D: Last episode, foe beaten miraculously.<br/><br/>The whole thing has become a farce. I am a huge fan of super-hero movies and TV shows.
I am still to this day giving this title a chance, and almost every episode I wonder why.
Story in this show is such that it's easier to count the lack of loopholes and paradoxes than the existence of them.<br/><br/>Script is just bad, storytelling and the relations between powers are such that you start hating anything that has anything to do with DC. Maybe CW has taken it upon itself to ruin a great character from the DC Universe!!! Probably a child who has never been exposed to genres of movies which never make people think would enjoy this. A show full of stupid plot holes and unnecessary nagging in the form of emotions.... Worthless emotions are given importance rather than good character building and meaningful backstories. Literally the viewership would spike if they kill off stupid emotions and IRIS WEST and bring in some meaningful story!!!!!! New season... new shows... can the Flash ever not apologize all the time? Sorry, no I mean really, sorry, can you not apologize Barry? Sorry, but really?<br/><br/>Followed by more white teeth schmaltz.<br/><br/>Same Canadian style. Guess go watch "DC'S Legends..." now. At least not the same... wait, it is the same. Style and everything but the obvious writing, 'cuz folk be dumb, and so write to them, and short term attention problems to let plot go that doesn't make sense, I guess.<br/><br/>Sorry. The Silver Age Flash was amazing. What the CW has done to him is nothing short of sad. The Silver Age Flash was wonderfully drawn by Carmine Infantino, who was able to capture his speed on paper. There were a slew of costumed villains that the Flash battled to save Central City. But in the CW Flash, Barry Allen and/or Starlabs is the cause of all the problems, deaths and ruined lives. And while I think Candice Patton is beautiful, all political correctness aside, Iris West was white, and so was her nephew, not her brother, Wally West, who, as Kid Flash, started out at around 12 years old. There was no Harrison Wells. There was no Cisco or Caitlin Snow. There wasn't even a Star Labs. Barry Allen was older and acted on his own. Iris, who didn't know his secret identity, had dubbed Barry the slowest man on earth. The Reverse Flash did come from the future, but he got his powers from radiation from the Flash's suit he had recovered. Barry Allen didn't display his costume on a mannequin. It shot out of the ring he wore, and there was just a slight suggestion of this being the case for him a decade or more from now. The Silver Age Flash's father didn't go to prison and his mother wasn't murdered. In fact, I don't even know if there was ever any mention of them. There is just too much fluff in the stories and Sisko invents devices that Isaac Asimov never even imagined, like a dark matter detector. Dark matter hasn't even been proved to be real. I'm just so tired of hearing Iris moan all the time, and Barry make excuses. For a forensic police scientist, we rarely even see him at work. The CW Supergirl is much the same way. Half of it has become the lesbian hour. When George Reeves was Superman, the story revolved around... Superman. The show lasted half an hour. Maybe that's what this series needs. A good haircut, cutting it down to the half hour of action, because that's all the writers seem capable of.<br/><br/>An afternote: When the goofy Harrison Wells went out in public, because Harrison Wells was branded a criminal, at first he needed to wear a face-altering device. Then that disappeared. The new (second) Harrison Wells doesn't appear to worry about this. Remember, though, it was the first Harrison Wells who triggered the explosion that caused all the metahumans and all of the problems. All in all, the series is all too whiny, none of the characters are really adults, including Joe. If humanity needed to depend on these clowns, we would all be doomed. Sorry, but the writing is just mediocre at best. Compare it to the writing for Game of Thrones or Outlander, Orphan Black, Humans, Rome, Battlestar Galactica... This is a kids show at best. A union card does not a writer make. The show is very entertaining but the ending is really bad. Here Barry was in the middle of stopping his worst enemy and he spent his time saving the worst criminals and making stupid deal with criminals.<br/><br/>The most stupid superhero of all time!<br/><br/>Then he spent his time saving criminal lives and one life after another but he was willing to risk ending the earth existence just to save his mother or gee - just to talk to her mother for a few seconds before she died.<br/><br/>What kind of logic is that?! The most selfish superhero of all time!<br/><br/>If the writers just stop to think and make the story more coherent then the show has hope. Bad writing.<br/><br/>Bad acting.<br/><br/>Some fans of Smallville might kinda like it.<br/><br/>But I find that even hard to believe.<br/><br/>This is a very rotten version of it.<br/><br/>Young kids might like it.. I don't know.. 6 or 7 year olds? But if I was 7 again.. nevermind.. I wouldn't like this.<br/><br/>Not really much else to say, it is a typical superhero show on CW. Poor effort throughout.<br/><br/>A bit of a shame, Flash was pretty cool in the JLA cartoons. Yeah go watch a JLA/Flash cartoon. Way better. I think it's really good and it's my favourite to show ever! I can't wait to see season 2 episode 1 which is out tomorrow in England! Yay! Yay Yay Yay Yay Yay Yay Yay Yay can't wait and grant gust is the best to play the flash with his cute smirk and stuff and I love his out fit. I really need to start a campaign to make a flash shop, where they sell leather flash suits, outfits, masks and stuff like that! I would really like that and by the way, if you haven't watched it yet, I highly recommend it to ages of about ten to on hundred years old and if you like destruction, this is the show for you! Make sure that you become familiar with the arrow first because he might make a few appearances but, I'm not gonna tell you when... Lol so, as I said WATCH IT IT IS THE BEST TELEVISION SHOW EVER!! S01 E01 Do teen shows have any original script or do writers and producers hope that the audience is that young not to remember last ten years of TV? I actually thought of watching a parody of the childhood scene. Watching the first episode was like looking at some legal document form you have seen dozen times except now it is a new guy who filled out the form and yes I don't know him, but I'm pretty sure what he is about to say. The siblings relationship, the crime solving, parenting all seem to have sort of quotation attribute as if the characters saying the lines and acting to remind you what great shows you have already seen. And the series does a good job at that, creating a perfect pitched pop song for the people with amnesia. And of course he is a genius, potential leader with moral compass and superpowers coming from the sky and you don't have to go to the gym anymore. What happened to the looser becomes winner stereotype that we liked so much, are there only two alternatives? At least Peter-man was a guy to cheer for before he could climbed the walls and shoot webs.<br/><br/>Characters are likable though, the future flash acts natural and actors surrounding seem to respond well to him, but the acts are so stereotypical that all credibility is lost before you even get excited about what to happen next. Instead you are watching a school play where kids are supposed to participate and you are sort of happy for them but unless your kid is in the play as well it is just not that entertaining as watching grown up stuff.<br/><br/>The production seems to be solid though so the audiences should be hooked up and not much disappointed if they are in to this from the beginning and besides it's a part of the DC universe investment creating the vast network of superdudes and dudettes.<br/><br/>Question is if everything looks and feels so staged and moving through the motions what do you have to look forward for to get invested in the show. One guess is special effects and more superpowers. When that exhilarates exponentially and toying with new abilities gets over saturated, what other focuses of the show will there be? Crime solving and personal agendas seem to be the most obvious choices. Comparing the one with True Detective and the other with maybe Six Feet Under, shallow predictability surrounded in blazing fireworks what I would expect from these TV series.<br/><br/>But I could be wrong and people seem to like it, so the hell I know. And of course I should watch more than one episode, maybe 2 more... Season 1 was just ok, then it started to get better over the next two seasons, now the last few seasons are sloppy, poorly written and acted. Its gotten pretty bad and boring to watch unfortunately!!! Really, in each CW hero show the 1st, 2nd and sometimes 3rd seasons are amazing. Fun, great stories, fun crossovers, awesome characters and villains, action the works. Then..... then it turns into a sad sad little universe. Haha enjoy what you can then feel ok about stop watching the show. This just became a s h i t show!!! This just became a s h i t show!!! Expecting great things from the Flash when I watched it (seasons 1 - 3) a couple months ago due to the immense popularity I was sorely disappointed. Lets start with what I like about the Flash:<br/><br/>It has a very comic book feel to it. It doesn't avoid comic book features like the costumes or the villain names and attitudes. The actors for the show are relatively good (for the CW). It also differs from the now common anti/dark hero trend that has been popular over the last decade or so. And based on its budget the CGI scenes are not horrible. It's a guilty pleasure. <br/><br/>Now why this review is so low:<br/><br/>Despite liking a few elements of the show, the show is honestly not good in my opinion. For one the script. The writers don't come up with realistic, or interesting obstacles for the protagonist based on his abilities. They go with a straightforward approach that anyone with commonsense and Barry's powers could overcome in like 2 seconds. The script for this show seems to cater to 5-10 year olds. They don't challenge or engage the audience. It is unbelievably predictable, cheesy, and unrealistic. The script seems to flow the same way every episode: 1. The flash faces a meta human; 2. The flash either loses the fight or the villain gets away; 3. The flash complains about not being fast enough to stop the villain and needs an emotional pep talk and a plan from his friends; 4. The flash goes back to the villain, gets the upper hand but then is close to losing again believing he can not perform the task necessary 5. He gets another pep talk from one of his friends which somehow gives him more "power" or" motivation"; 6. Completes the task, defeats villain, and goes back to star labs... Add to that some unnecessary relationship melodrama and that's a standard episode script for the Flash. There is no subtext in the dialogue, everything is clearly stated. The dialogue seems like it is written by a kid. "We believe in you", "Run, Barry RUN!", "You're nothing but a monster...", "I'm not fast enough" etc.<br/><br/>SPOILERS BELOW:<br/><br/>Now the characters, they are very....frankly stupid and inconsistent. Barry once decided to give up his speed to save Wally which should've had a lot more consequences given the fact that he left two entire worlds left at Zooms mercy and also couldn't protect himself (or his loved ones including Wally) anymore. Zoom would've (if this was realistic) just killed Barry and Wally after he got his speed. Barry is ruled by his emotions causing more problems. Another example is in the season 3 finale, Barry is taking his sweet time saying goodbye to his friends while there is a supernatural speed force storm creating grave havoc in the background which no one cares about. The other characters are very 1-dimensional with no nuance nor shades of grey whatsoever. They all overreact, catch feelings, and need to be consoled by someone else. The writers also feel the need to try force every character into a relationship every damn season, from Barry Allen all the way down to Jesse Quick. Everyone has sometime type of relationship drama eventually. Caitlin falls for someone every damn season. The show is like a soap opera with a lot of action. The melodrama really bogs down the show. <br/><br/>The story has many plot-holes and inconsistencies it's unbelievable. I'm not even talking about the explanation of the speed force or the appearance of meta humans, I'm talking about the lore of the show, it doesn't add up. Barry is as slow or as fast as the show needs him to be. Barry, who calls him self the fastest man alive yet constantly complains about people being faster than him, is fast enough to make and give people standing in a line coffee without being spotted, and catch a bullet at near point blank range, but is too slow to see someone punching him (like when Eddie did) or simply take out Captain Cold and Heatwave before they start blasting their guns at him. Barry's character is also a very emotional character who doesn't see the bigger picture. Cisco is able to build mind blowing inventions in the span of a few hours, Barry is able to give someone his speed etc. There are almost no lasting consequences to Barry's time travel shenanigans, for instance how pathetic Flashpoint was. The show never goes there, you know at the end of the day everything will be okay which is not good for a TV show. Barry in the comics was much different than this.<br/><br/>Now my personal beefs (some of what is stated above is repeated just more vulgar). Barry is an idiot, Iris is annoying, Wally is a little b**** as is Cisco (first part of season 3). The characters whine and cry way too much. The plethora of Harrison Wells and same repetitive story of initial mistrust is overused and boring. The seasons are way too long, and the filler is unbearable and uninteresting. The pep talks make me cringe. The situations are unbelievable stupid (every major villain wants to end the finale off with some kind of race) way too much villain speedsters. No actually character development. Every character reacts the same, they are honestly no different from each other. They get plagued by emotions and do something stupid which needs to be fixed. The police procedural in this show are so untrue. The reuse of CGI scenes (especially Barry running) The way the show is written makes it seem like they believe the audience is stupid. I hate how they make it villains vs hero, no layers to the characters. All in all terrible show but it brings the comic book hero to life and its an okay pastime so if you want to try it don't let this review stop you. The Flash is the best adaptation of a hero from every series that's out there. It has everything. Plus, the villains are always cool (Thawne, Zoom, Captain Cold). The sad part are the fillers between the story episodes. Sometimes the little stories from the fillers are boring. But for the main story, the characters, Grant, the villains and that time travel stuff going around, definitely would recommend to anyone. I really, honestly don't understand how such an awful show like this can have such a high rating, when we have other shows like House of Cards, Breaking Bad or the Vikings to compare them to. I barely managed to get through with the pilot, it was so terribly awful, cringe worthy. So fast paced, predictable and cliché, with pointless drama and pointless dialogue and missing dialogue from key scenes. Felt as if the writers did their best to gather every peak in a possible plot and mix it up in one episode. Horrible. Sorry, but is absolutely terrible. They could have filled an entire series with the turns and twists of the first episode only. And even if the actors are pretty good, feels like is such a children's show. It seems these days the writers of shows Do NOT even check Google for simple facts . Really , it takes about 2 minutes to find the fact : <br/><br/>BULLETS - The average bullet travels at 2,500 feet per second (around 1,700 mph).<br/><br/>SOUND travels at 768 miles per hour (1,126 feet per second)—about half the speed of the bullet. <br/><br/>SO HOW THE HELL THE FLASH saves people from being shot by running faster than the bullet and moving them out of harms way ?????<br/><br/>According to all the episodes the flash usually gets up to 600 mph , in extreme circumstances (5,3 mile straight run) - he can reach the speed of sound (and create a sonic boom) . :-) :-) :-) Or about 800 mph ..... <br/><br/>so ....Flash is short just about 900 mph more to be able to run as fast as the bullet . and to OUTRUN the bullet and save the person , I don't know,<br/><br/>add 100 mph <br/><br/>So its a really tiny oversight of a 1000 miles per hour difference. :- ) <br/><br/>I'm not even going to mention the rest of the hundreds of discrepancies , just this one is enough. Do you also think the Earth is flat , and the Sun rotates around Hollywood ? <br/><br/>Bravo writers ! what was the award called "Razzie" ? or something similar. Barry Allen is an idiot with powers. Every other week he unlearns the lesson to trust "the power of friendship" and mopily fails because of his stupidity.
He can't keep his mask on, and why bother? Most of Star City knows this chinless goon is the Flash and just don't care.
They drag on storylines unnecessarily for weeks and weeks, if these situations existed in real life they could be solved with a few honest phone calls. As David Ramsey said in a panel "Flash is happy and brighter while Arrow is just dark and cool.." which is true. Flash definitely has a brighter atmosphere, making it sort of the yin to Arrow's yang in a way. Oh my God, how much I love this series to continue forever. crying How the hell does Barry Allen even become a forensic scientist with a brain that slow? I have seen autistic people in real life understand things faster than him. So you get superpowers and can't use it to full extent cause you somehow need help of your friends to achieve that. What a bunch of crap load is this? Any rational person getting superpower will push it to the limit, unlike the flash who's too afraid. Also his reactions are slower than an average human being, as he's defeated by slow moving individuals like Captain Cold .Seriously, did he not see Captain Cold trying to point a gun at him when he's at super speed? How did he catch a bullet then? There is absolutely no logic to the show, even if it is Sci-Fi. Also the characters are very tasteless except joe west and dr wells. There are too many shortcomings in this show for me to like it. The first season started off well with a good backstory for the characters. He was learning to use his powers. They had pretty decent villains (Always great to see the prison break brothers) and he was better without Iris. But as the show progresses you can tell that they're desperate for content. couple that with the worst directing and the minimal tv budget with which they have to work with, you get one crappy show. They tried to do crossovers with other DC shows since then but again supergirl and arrow aren't great either to hold up the show's worth. It's a dying show and is probably going to be cancelled sooner or later. On a separate note, I hope marvel doesn't do the same mistake to their shows. 'Jessica Jones' and 'Daredevil' started brilliantly but the latest seasons didn't really meet my expectations. There are plenty of other good shows out there. Just saying. So now I have to watch the arrow and superwoman and all so I can know what's going on between episod 7 and 8 none sense I thought the flash is a good series but now it's a bs I use to be a fan of this show. Now I can hardly sit through an episode without getting seriously frustrated. It's now the fourth season and the show hasn't matured. It needs to get really dark and pull as much gore as it can. By the way, please get rid of Wally West, watching him on the screen makes me feel disgusted. God I hate DC Comics characters on TV series. The writing for all of them is just so predictable, they are all the same. The Flash, The Arrow, The DareDevil and on and on.<br/><br/>All the super heroes are whining wimps who are always depressed about some woman or are having emotional problems of some sort. There is about 10 minutes of action and plot and the other 50 minutes is the characters talking about their emotional problems. It's the same old crap over and over in each of these series. You could easily swap the characters out in these shows and never miss a tear.<br/><br/>But The Flash is the worst of them all as far as the superhero is concerned. This dude is constantly getting his ass kicked. He's getting beat up by every villain he goes up against. You would think that he would win every fist fight he's in because of his super speed but NO, he's too slow to dodge punches and too slow to connect with his own so he is punched out by normal speed villains.<br/><br/>But then he catches bullets. There is a problem with this that the writers and the super fans haven't thought of. A normal 9mm bullet travels at approximately 1250 ft/sec which is 852 mph, plus that bullet has a muzzle energy of 401 ft/lbs, which if one's hand is moved into the path of that bullet, that energy is going to carry that bullet through one's hand and carry on till that energy is exhausted. The Flash is not Superman and his hands are not able to dissipate that energy.The only way to catch a bullet is to run along beside it til the energy is dissipated and catch it before it hits the ground. <br/><br/>He travels through time. Time can be slowed down by the person traveling. While time of the traveler is slowed down, time of the stationary person on Earth continues at it's normal pace so the stationary person ages faster than the person traveling, but this is not truly time travel. There is no way to actually go BACK in time, only slow time down by the perspective of the traveler. <br/><br/>Plus The Flash can run NO WHERE NEAR the speed of light. Although I have heard the term mentioned in the TV shows several times I have only heard his actual speed mentioned 1 time when he hit mach 2 (1522 mph) in the round tunnel thingy and this is nowhere near fast enough to travel through time. And he had a really hard time hitting this speed. It took a lot of coaching and cheer leading from his "team" to make that speed. <br/><br/>They add a new Earth called Earth2 so they can keep the old actors that were killed off earlier, instead of firing them from the show. They just become doppelgangers from "Earth2".<br/><br/>Everybody on the show knows the Flash is Barry Alen except The Flash's girl friend, and I mean everybody. Even characters that don't matter know who the Flash is, but not his girlfriend. Oh, and nobody tells the secret. This is the best kept secret in the history of the Earth. Even the villains don't rat him out. UNBELIEVABLE.<br/><br/>By S2E8 there are a zillion superheros all working together and they have a hell of a time bringing down one villain.<br/><br/>This show mainly sucks but in my perspective it is mostly because of all the emotional problems EVERYONE in the show has. This series is a constant whine fest. It is worse than the old soap operas of the 70's and 80's Like "General Hospital" and "As the Stomach Turns". After the first season I thought 'another good TV show on the horizon'; After the second one 'yep we lost another one'... so I went here to read some more reviews and apparently I'm not the only one who feel this way; My favorite comment is mikomanninen's from Finland so I'm just gonna paste it here : - All portals to the other earth were closed. Zoom is fatally sick. In a few years he would die by himself. No real reason to open portal to other earth.<br/><br/><ul><li>Barry is faster than Zoom. Barry captures Zoom but does not knock him out or anything. Instead Barry just talks to Zoom and fails to keep him captured. Also the trap they made for Zoom is stupid. Barry already is faster than Zoom so there was no need for a trap.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>When Zoom handed over Wally to the Flash team, why didn't Barry just break the deal and kill him or at least knock him out and capture him?. Instead Barry makes the most retarded decision he has ever made. He gives his powers to the serial killer Zoom, who could kill everyone in the earth especially when there is no one to stop him (the Flash is the only one who could stop him).</li></ul><br/><br/>So Barry risks both earths for no good reason. Was he afraid to fight Zoom? Who knows. I hope they don't make this kind of writing mistakes in the future or the Flash is over for me. Best show in years, don't believe it's gone downhill at all, can't wait for next season Best season ever I have watched of the flash and the season finale is the best the ending that fan's wanted but what happened to the director he was focusing on the other characters not on the flash. The cast and characters are new level of deep, feels as though your apart of the team. Flash is probably the best show I've seen in years. Haven't been disappointed once. The show always has me on the edge wanting more can't wait for mid season break of season 5 is over. If you're a fan of superhero shows,the comics or a fan of the Arrow series,then "The Flash" will be right up your alley..Otherwise,you can watch the first few episodes and decide.. While Arrow went the Christopher Nolan route with being realistic and all(though that's decreasing with every season),Flash embraces it comic book roots like no other show there.I mean,there is a talking gorilla as a villain,dammit!!!And with the exception of Iris West,all the other characters are very likable,with Grant Gustin nailing Barry Allen and his support team too bring in the humour..It's a perfect antithesis to the Arrow and Daredevil series All in all,The Flash depends on your tastes..It's a good watch I absolutely loved this pilot!! As a comic book fan myself I don't mind the few changes as it makes it more modern.It always is going to seem cheesy because it is a comic book show. You cant have everything perfect. Also I love how they added some of theistic from the Toby Maguire Spider-Man as well nice touch! So looking forward to more of this show. I also enjoyed the costume change as well. That definitely needed an upgrade. I also really appreciated the meeting between Flash and Arrow. Otherwise it wouldn't have made sense as they do live in the same universe. I would go on but all I can say is the show has potential to be one of the best TV shows running right now!! Season one of The Flash was brilliant! Season two was pretty good. I should have stopped watching then but noooo, trying to be loyal....I suffered through seasons three and four. But season five is where I draw the line. Everything that was once good about this show is gone. Tom Cavanagh should have left after season two. He's better than this. It seem this studio continues insult the intelligence of the Audience. after they brought us "the arrow" and "the tomorrow people", 2 of the most stupid TV show ever made, they got credit to continue flood the screen with another insult TV show.<br/><br/>I really don't get how someone can write so poor plot, unless he is 10 years old(Maybe this is the solution for this joke?).<br/><br/>what else I really don't get is, how they get screen time with such plots? <br/><br/>where are the good old shows like: prison break,lost(without the end),heroes,24(the first 3 seasons)?<br/><br/>a lot of good other TV shows stooped after one season and "the arrow" is already at season 3,really??? This is another example of leftists trying to infect our society with their political agenda. Let me just say that I am not racist. I am perfectly OK with black characters and would be just as mad if they used a white actor to play a black superhero like Spawn. I am upset that they have decided to use black actors to play white characters like Iris West. I feel as though they are using the story of the Flash to push a multicultural agenda on us. They can't just do that to a classic and expect people to accept it without complaint. To those who made this series - stop trying to push your anti-white agenda on us. Shame on you for putting politics first. This is the first time I felt the need of leaving a review in 4-5 years since I'm using IMDb. I can say, as a DC fan that this TV-series gets more and more disappointing. The actors are without a doubt the worst choice the casting director could have made. (I mean seriously, JD's brother as the main villain? ) . Also, the every episode is very poorly written, it's like they don't even try. Just put some clichés there and some really bad puns ( In the last episode, The Flash fights with a girl who uses bees or robotic bees to attack him and she felts the need of using puns like "get out or I'll BUZZ myself in" and after one minute uses the phrase " Do you know what it's like to be stung by someone? I will sting you now". Not sure why DC or WB allows this to happen. Marvel just released Daredevil, a character with far less potential than The Flash and for a superhero series, it is brilliant compared to this. Okay, The Flash, can run and move fast, and that's about it. <br/><br/>This is a pretty boring 'Super Hero', and is in the bargain basement of powers and abilities, and I can't see this show getting any better with this one premise.<br/><br/>The Barry Allen character is just so much like Peter Parker, it adds to the dullness of the show. The other characters are just cardboard, clichéd, and forgettable, and not one of them is likable. <br/><br/>The so called mysteries surrounding Flash, are not at all gripping, and I don't find myself interested in finding out there conclusion.<br/><br/>The only point worth mentioning is the visuals, especially when Flash battles the villain in the pilot episode.<br/><br/>I'd say this show is strictly for under 10's only. This I like...but I have always been a sucker for the Flash and, honestly, I love how well it contrasts Arrow.<br/><br/>On one part of town the depressed overly violent washed-up rich playboy hero with a bleak outlook of the world around him...<br/><br/>...and on the other the fun and light-heated Flash.<br/><br/>It's a little more fun and the stakes don't seem to be as high. Central City seems to be the better, more prosperous, and far brighter city to live in. It's partly because of the Flash and partly because that uplifting feel that they give the program makes you believe everything is going to be OK...<br/><br/>...and with Arrow you know it's not.<br/><br/>So you have the nice, fun, relief that works brilliantly well with its dark and gritty counter. I'm not a Comics geek. Sure I read some DC, Marvel and whatnot when I was a teen, had my favorite heroes and I remember the Flash TV show of the 90s quite well.<br/><br/>I grew up enjoying the Flash as a comic character and I have to say I am quite pleased with this Show. The 90s one was lacking villains, this one has lots of them and cross references with the Arrow quite well.<br/><br/>The FXs are great 99% of the time, the Crisis plot is there and the characters are quite interesting.<br/><br/>Maybe there will be an introduction to some other DC heroes like Batman and Superman as well. I don't know about you but I have a hunch we will be seeing a Batman TV show soon enough<br/><br/>Let's see where it is heading to. I mean come on guys let's face it the show is going worse than worse every season and this season finally was garbage Seasons 1-3 = 7 stars ✨
Seasons 4-5 = 3 stars ✨
After that, I couldn't tell you because I quit. Reason being, Barry Allen ceased to be the main character and the side characters took over, in a bad way. Plots became borderline stupid, the overall arch became lame, and Iris West is to blame.
My advice, quit at the end of season 3 and start watching Supergirl instead. Nothing against the actress, but the character Iris ruins the show. I've tried to keep an open mind about her through the seasons, thinking she'll get less annoying over time. But, the writers keep pushing her character down our throats and the writing keeps going downhill. So, I've decided to stop watching. Seasons 1-3 were so good. Season 2 was by far my favorite. Zoom and the entire story they created behind him was amazing to watch. Then we get to season 4 and it's all downhill. Very, very difficult for me to watch. Elongated Man and Iris are so annoying. Iris as team leader? No thanks. Everyone seems to be getting powers, the metas are beyond cheesy. Oh and I expect when I'm watching THE FLASH to see a lot of the character, THE FLASH.<br/><br/>What happens to these CW shows? First couple seasons are always good and then it's like the writers just give up. She ruined every enjoyable thing about the show. So unbelievably irritating!
Poor Grant Gustin... he is such a good "Flash" and he disappeared in the inexplicably enormous and completely uncalled for Iris-Shadow! And in case we manage to take a light breath, we get Wally and then Nora shoved down our recreation throats. I don't like it any more!
I fast-forward the episodes now, just to keep me up-to-date for the Arrowverse cross-overs.
Very disappointing. Pity... it started off so promisingly... I would gladly have given it an 8 at least...
... and there's only so much Tom Cavanagh can do to salvage some bits... or Carlos Valdes, for that matter... Bad writing as the seasons progressed. Season 1 was good then past season 2,the show went downhill. This show became a cringe fest-"we are the flash", like what!? They should have gotten rid of Iris and should have made a more intricate storyline then having to face a new villain everyweek. I stopped watching this show after season 4 and I'm glad I did considering how bad season 5 and 6 were. The flash started off great. Good character development and the Zoom story arc kept you guessing and was exciting. Then the magic faded. The Flash is now dwindled into a boring mess that had all the cast in endless dialogue of pointless soul searching and bonding. Get on with it! Super hero shows spend more time these days sitting around than actually doing anything, the total flip is in the comics. The time Barry actually spends in his suit is so low i don't even think he knows where it is anymore. It needs a revamp of characters, iris needs to go. Cisco needs to get out of STAR labs and they need to have more action!!!! First of all, Flash is NOT the fastest man alive....
The series is plagued itself with lazy writing, unnecessary powerups for supporting characters. Basically everyone in the series will become a speedster. I can go on and on about how this series lost its charm over the years...
Nevertheless season 1 to 3 are very good Dear friends, anyone who grow up with Flash, knows that the most important thing is remain faithful with the origin of the character. Here, you will have the main actor looking exactly like the last Spiderman. Even the same hair. But we understand the laws of TV shows. You can ask for good performances... here, the work of the protagonists is so wooden. I can't believe that the best actor is the same star who was the great villain of Highlander. The script: like the lasts Spiderman movies, the most important thing is the values and inner feelings of Barry Allen. I feel shame when his friends tried to bring him a superalcoholic beverage, looking to see him drunk. When you find the history, the work of actors, and the environment of the show so boring, so frustrating, so anticlimax... What can we do? Only pray for better script, and perhaps, a miracle. If we follow this story as we see today, the next Flash movie will be a giant disaster. As a fan of Arrow, I was interested in seeing how this show would play out. I have to say that DC is killin it with this show. They have learned from their mistakes with Arrow and improved on it with the flash. The writing is funny and witty. The acting is pretty great. The villains are all quite interesting. The man who plays Barry Allen is great. He's got just the right amount of corny and hes a funny guy. I love how this show doesn't take itself too seriously. Arrow did get a bit dark, especially with Season 2. This show is much more upbeat and carefree which is a nice change of pace. After a few episodes in, I can say that this show is off to a very good start, and if it keeps going this way, it's gonna be as good, if not better, than Arrow. i think that the flash was awful. i know many people would disagree with me but this is just my opinion. The pace of the story line is just way too slow. The plot is weak and the only reason people even watch this show is because they think that the super hero in this show is cool, not because of the plot. The whole show feels way too cliché and not enough originality.I definitely would not ever recommend this to anyone unless except for ten year old kids who just care about the superhero.that is why i am just gonna give this show a one out of ten. I would give it even less stars but it doesn't let me. In conclusion i think that watching this show was a complete waste of my time but if you want a cool superhero show with great plot this is not it. This Turd needs to get flushed ASAP. If you love good writing, directing, acting, CGI and Drama then stay away - FAR AWAY. The Flush quality is a few steps below the worst season of Power Rangers. I have seen homebrew fan fiction better than this. Do not waste your time on this TURD and just FLUSH IT already...for good! Never read the comics but don't think i want to,anymore. this show is  so lame with wooden characters,poor CGI,terrible writing.Marvel really  blew it on this one. i only checked it out cause of the high rating and  viewer ship,which it obviously doesn't deserve.everyone always have  perfect makeup and hair even though they've been in a storm or been  running faster than light?? see,these little things ruins the  originality resulting in "okay" and forgettable episodes. i just wish  the story was a bit more dark and the characters weren't as wooden as  they possibly could be??check out daredevil or Jessica Jones.those are  way better superhero adaptations compared to this piece of plastic  crap. Everything is perfect about this series, apart from Candice Patton. She is completely misplaced and clueless about her character. Her failed efforts to fit in are really embarrassing. I am truly disappointed with her performance, especially that she is supposed to be the main motivation for the hero's drive. She is undoubtedly the worst possible choice for the role. I will resume enjoying the series as soon as she is kicked out of it. Otherwise, the plot is very clever, inspiring and engaging, to say the least. The intersection with Arrow was a welcomed twist, I must admit that I hoped it would intertwine much more than it actually did. So finally it's here. After swearing not to follow another CW cheap series after Supernatural ends, which hasn't happened, I found myself catching up with two seasons of Arrow in a matter of days after ignoring it for 2 years, just because a friend told me that Flash is featured in it and there'll be a stand-alone show for him. I had been waiting for something for Flash for years, with its exciting ideas and possibilities, and now, the first episode didn't disappoint.<br/><br/>The show appears to be following some standard superhero and CW routines, which is frustrating and annoying sometimes, but also can be done well. It's at its worst when it gets into relationships and characters we couldn't care less, and at its best when...you guessed it, when it strikes you with the actions. Some over-familiar elements have to be addressed here. Anyone who has seen one episode of Smallville can tell the unmistakable similarity between their pilots, namely the big idea that create our one-episode super-powered freaks. Only what used to be a Kryptonite meteor-storm becomes an unknown energy breakout in the city. Then there's the "my dream girl's dad is a cop and he wants his daughter out of it so I'm filled with guilt" formula that has been used just way too many times in recent years. From the Amazing Spider-Man series to Flash's sister show, Arrow. Seriously CW? You guys really that short on scripts?<br/><br/>Speaking of Arrow, Oliver's guest appearance is most welcome here, even though he didn't really do anything. It gave me some expectations in his coming 3rd season. But to be honest, I usually have to fast- forward some Arrow sequences that involve his girlfriend Laurel or his sister. Green Arrow is a very limited hero, so a large part of the show has to be focused on relationships and character development, which usually in CW shows range from mediocre to downright unwatchable. The Flash, on the other hand, although share some of those problems, does promise a kick-ass action that wakes me up instantly. It's not of movie standards of course, but it's satisfactory enough it made me say "so that's where my Supernatural budget went."<br/><br/>So where does it stand among the many superhero-themed shows today? It's still hard to tell because it's only the pilot, but for now I would place it above Arrow and Agents of Shield. Gotham? It's also a new show and it looks promising, we'll just see. Please note that I literally never post reviews online, and that this show was so horribly awful that I actually created an email account and registered for this site so that I could post this, and hopefully save somebody's life, who might otherwise choke on a pretzel or piece of popcorn while viewing this gag-worthy tripe that is being passed off as a great show.<br/><br/>First of all, if you watched the pilot episode and you are still reading this, it means you are likely over 10 years old, and are desperately hoping that the show gets much, much better as it goes along.<br/><br/>Well, I was able to watch as far as episode 2... okay, most of the way through episode 2, before my gag-reflex started to kick in again, and I could no longer keep it down; so let me tell you that no, actually, it gets even worse (if that is indeed possible).<br/><br/>Without taking up an entire page here, and more of your valuable time that could be spent not watching this show, it should suffice to say that this show was either made for children, or the writers, casting director, and producer think you are incredibly stupid and shallow, and will not catch on to the fact that their minions are flooding the reviews on IMDb with false positives; which, really is only a working theory at this point, but one I made up in the hopes that there cannot truly be that many people out there dumb enough to buy into this show.<br/><br/>My only other plausible theory is that many thousands of tweens thought that they were in fact voting for the next American Idol, and somehow the lines got crossed on IMDb with reviews for this tragedy of a show.<br/><br/>The so-called "acting" in this show is something you would expect only on Disney Channel or Nickelodeon, and is, as many on here have noted, cringe-worthy, laughable, and not in the least believable. It would be nice if we could place the blame solely on bad writing, but you would think that if that was the case, at least one of the performers would find a way to break through and add some believable moments into the production; but sadly, this is not the case.<br/><br/>The dialogue is extremely shallow, just like the characters, but the plot and overall story-line are almost like a sick joke at times; so predictable and juvenile that you almost feel like you're watching something akin to "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers". I don't know who is directing this runaway train, but it seems that they also have their fingers in that highly acclaimed show Arrow as well (whose main character made a rather cheesy appearance in the pilot of this show), so I most definitely will not be watching that either.<br/><br/>For the life of me I cannot understand how horrendous shows like this stay on the air, while extremely creative and memorable series are cut short. It seems that Hollywood has caught on that their viewers will clamor for and pay for any recycled garbage they put in front of them at this point, and are content with simply phoning in a performance, as long as it nets them a paycheck.<br/><br/>I really don't feel like wasting another second on reviewing this heap of flaming canine feces, and can only say that I wish I could have that hour and a half of my life back, so that I could do something more enjoyable with it, like having my fingernails ripped off one by one very slowly... Show about a nerd that gets superpowers after being struck by lightning and becomes the fastest man alive... unfortunately his super speed doesn't affect his thoughts and he runs faster than a speeding bullet into the dumbest situations imaginable, usually into the path of another meta-human and gets his arse handed to him. Not only a numbskull of epic proportions, but also the fastest stalker alive, as in trying to keep his existence a secret, he manages to repeatedly appear incognito to his love interest who happens to be writing an internet blog about his persona's antics. The script is on par with the shows partner series, The Arrow, which isn't a complement as it unfortunately shares the same weak plot and cheesy lines. It's obviously written to a target audience consisting of an nest of rabbits and people with the IQ of turnips. I started watching this show while recovering from an accident. I couldn't walk for weeks and watching the Flash run gave me life. I was hooked. Season 1 of the series is probably the best. If you've just started watching, my advice is to cherish those moments with your favorite characters because the writers of this show do not understand character development. We're into season 3, and everyone is a shadow of the person they used to be. Dr. Caitlin Snow's character had made the most progress until tonight's episode - 3x12 - where these people erased everything they had done to make her one of the best parts of this show. I am sick of Barry and Caitlin's character regressions with each passing week. The former is always depressed. The latter is always in doubt of herself. These are not the characters I fell in love with. This is not the show I fell in love with. If you think it's easy for me to write this, you're wrong. I am devastated. The Flash is my favorite show. I'm writing this in the hope that SOMEONE from the show somehow reads it. I need them to realize the wasted potential here. I need them to know that this show helped through a very difficult period in my life. I need them to stop ruining the Flash. I only gave it a two to save room for things like "Birdemic".<br/><br/>I am only two episodes in and I feel like I have irretrievably lost 80-90 minutes of my life. Season 1 is on Netflix and, having completely enjoyed both DareDevil and Jessica Jones, my teenagers and I were up for more superhero binge watching. Two episodes in and they are dozing off and I elected to clean the kitchen (again) instead of enduring the final 10 minutes.<br/><br/>An implausible script with gaping plot holes, wooden (at best) acting and dialogue that should have died with the end of the ABC Afterschool Specials. It looks as though this is going to work well. The pilot was enjoyable and has scope for development.<br/><br/>But before the purists start shaking their heads and muttering. THIS ISN'T the comic. It does have some differences from the earlier TV rendition and the comic book. If it was the same and had actors that looked/ sounded the same as before or were identical to them what would be the point in watching it ? It's a TV series of a comic book character and it has (so far) been done credibly and solidly. It has taken the basic premise and used it. The characters need some fleshing out and the actors need to grow into their skins. <br/><br/>Hopefully the story lines will improve as the series grows.<br/><br/>Watch it with an open mind. It will be worth it if the pilot is anything to go by. At first I thought this was a fun show, a turn your mind off fun distraction. But each episode got worse and worse, with more and more ridiculous plots. Many other reviewers have already mentioned how dumb the 'conflict' is. 90% of the time he should be able to just go really fast, grab the guy/his weapon, done. Instead, he gets into fist fights, or does some elaborate something or other and saves the day. <br/><br/>I gave it another try the other day, and within a few minutes I heard someone say 'I have to hack the mainframe', got into this 'mainframe' within seconds and deactivated some thing or whatever. God I hate that crap. <br/><br/>It's just another setup for the 'monster of the week' formula that I have grown so incredibly tired of. Want to watch intelligent science fiction that isn't incredibly stupid? Try Mr. Robot. This show had an amazing pilot that never made me tire of action or story. The story is fairly done and though DC is taking its movies down a grittier line, we still have Arrow (our Emerald Crusader/Dark Knight) and we have Flash (our Crimson Speedster/Man of Steel), however Barry isn't invincible, and this show brings out the truth of becoming a superhero with powers. Flash shows us the hopeful side of DC as well as bringing that hope into the every week's heart of fans. Side Note: In light of the huge rave Batman V. Superman is getting, we get to enjoy (Flash and Arrow episode 8) CW's Batman V Superman before Warner Bro's Batman V. Superman XD. This show shows extremely high potential and is living up to the expectations set up by its great liner-backs (Arrow, Man of Steel, The Dark Knight Trilogy, etc..) 10/10 Why does everybody like this show? Arrow is the best. This show is repetitive. five reasons I don't like it: 1. The acting is bad. 2. The Villains are bad. 3. The characters never change. 4. The character development is bad. 5. It's just boring. Out of all of the CW DC shows it's the worst. Here is the list of CW DC shows from best to worst: 1. Arrow 2. Supergirl 3. DC's Legends of Tomorrow 4. The Flash. Am i the only one who thinks this show is horrible? Don't watch it! Listen to me! Please it is so bad it is bad for your health. I'm serious! Just don't watch it. No matter what your friends say. Don't watch it. Please don't. no matter what. Don't. I hope I helped you make a good choice. :) Not one for these live action uncanonical series, since they dramatically de- power superheroes to ridiculous points. Never realised that it would do so as much as it did but well, that's the way it is.<br/><br/>I never could anticipate how cringy the whole affair would be though. For example, a recent episode showed a very hoary scene of the Flash helplessly struggling to break free from King Shark's claw; the very one that Superboy one-shotted in canon. Despite the Flash having light speed reflexes and speed, the gap of time between him turning around to a not-so quickly moving arm and being caught was apparently not enough for dodging. And they can happily disregard the fact that the Flash can become intangible.<br/><br/>It's moments like those that really make me want to screw up my face, because it's where bad acting fuses with directly contradicting events. Much lower power, much higher senselessness. But I'll give it a couple of points for some pretty SFX. The Flash is an entertaining and gripping TV series. It's a wonderful show and I absolutely love it. <br/><br/>The character of Dr. Harrison Wells is played by Tom Cavanagh and he plays the role of a villain brilliantly. He exudes that deep and sinister look which will definitely send a thrill down your spine. Now, coming to the protagonist - Barry Allen is a charming person. He shows that it doesn't take a muscular body to be a superhero and it's not only the superpowers that make him so special. Cisco Ramon is another awesome character who completes his job as the funny one. The only character I found weak was that of Iris West. She wasn't fitted in the story nicely and soon into the series the character became irritating. Everything else is excellent. You will be engrossed by the simplicity of the fictitious science they use and explain. It's a lovely show, I'd recommend it to everyone irrespective of their age. This series owes a lot to the 1990 series "The Flash", which in many ways was better. Perhaps, the series acknowledges this by casting the actor from the 1990 series as Barry's father, a nice touch.<br/><br/>For a TV series, the special effects are well done, though on rare occasions they are somewhat lame.<br/><br/>As for the writing, the story throws in some surprises and keeps you guessing.<br/><br/>Now, for the characters, Tom Cavanagh as Wells/Thawne has his character down pat. I have met people like that, people who make a deliberate attempt to appear as a good person yet are wolves in sheep's clothing. Also, Carlos Valdes is really good as Cisco, so good that one cannot picture anyone else in the part. In addition, Grant Gustin makes a likable hero.<br/><br/>Concerning Gustin's character, the writers have made Barry Allen too naive. Really, he was surprised when a crook did not keep his promise! He should be smarter. After all, Barry is 26 years old and works for the police. One would think that he would have learned something about the world with that background.<br/><br/>Then, the writers had Barry do something that was really irritating in the season one finale. After spending the entire season being obsessed with clearing his father and freeing him from prison and being traumatized by his mother's death, when given the chance to change all that, he does nothing!! When Wells asks why and states that Allen could have everything he wants, Barry replies he already had everything. That just demolishes what a good portion of season one spent building.<br/><br/>Then, there is Iris. As a previous reviewer stated, the I want to know everything attitude can make her obnoxious. Also, I think it was a mistake having her discover that Barry is the Flash. Some good subplots could have been worked into later stories.<br/><br/>Finally, Caitlin is likable and seems a better fit for Barry, the same could be said for Iris and Ronny.<br/><br/>Once again, regarding the season one finale, the writers set up the second season for some intriguing possibilities. With Thawne wiped out of existence by Eddy: Will Barry's mother be alive and his father free? Will the real Harrison Wells be around? Will Barry get his powers in another way? To sum it up, "The Flash" is a good series and worth watching, but it does need tweaking.<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/><br/>Season two is on a par with the first. Though, one good change is that they softened the character of Iris.<br/><br/>Cavanaugh continues to give a good performance, making a good distinction between the evil Wells and the one from Earth II.<br/><br/>I still think that the writers need to wise up the Barry Allen character. Also, they need to follow more of a logical pattern. For instance, The Flash is fast, but on encountering a villain, he does not react fast when she unleashes a sonic blast. In other words, make The Flash more competent.<br/><br/>Finally, they should have Barry and Caitlin get together. It's just more of a fit and could make for some interesting stories.<br/><br/>SECOND UPDATE:<br/><br/>This series showed promise in season one, but has deteriorated with each successive season.<br/><br/>As I said before, the writers need to wise up Barry Allen. I don't expect a superhero to be perfect, but he should at least have a level of competence. For instance, the Flash encounters a super villain; he knows the villain's powers, yet he just stands there and lets the super villain attack him. What happened to the Flash's super reflexes?<br/><br/>Now, the current season has had too much emphasis on the relationship between Barry and Iris to the point that the series has become maudlin. It even led to the silly musical episode -- totally ridiculous.<br/><br/>Also, enough of the speedsters! There's the Flash, Kid Flash, Girl Flash, Reverse Flash, Zoom, and now Savatar. The series only needs one speedster, the Flash.<br/><br/>And, can't the writers be more creative when it comes to villains? Must they resort to speedsters?<br/><br/>As may be guessed, because of the above, I am lowering my rating to five stars. First of all, if you're a DC fan, then you'll be watching or at least tried watching The Flash. And most likely you'd have watched it after seeing Barry Allen's appearance in Arrow's second season.<br/><br/>To be honest, all superhero films and comics have their own tone and unique qualities to them. DC has pumped out three big series in recent months: Arrow, Gotham, and The Flash. Obviously, they can't go the same route for each show.<br/><br/>Sure, there may be similarities between CW's the Arrow and the Flash in terms of the types of characters in each show. But overall, you get more of a "comic" type feel in the Flash which makes it more of a light and fun series compared to the others. And that's probably why there are so many negative reviews out there regarding how simple and toned down The Flash is. <br/><br/>But I think it's a great show, considering what other shows are currently on and what they're trying to portray in The Flash. Barry Allen is obviously the youngest of the DC superheroes we've seen on screen so far (vs. Arrow and James Gordon), so he's going to be the one with the most simple issues. As a result, we see a young superhero trying to do good for his city, but needing guidance along the way. <br/><br/>With Gotham being so dark and grim, and Arrow so full of death and darkness as well, The Flash gives viewers a much brighter environment to enjoy. It's also more suitable for kids who want to watch superhero shows without all the killing. Instead of seeing arrows impaling human beings or bullets shooting through bone and tissue, you get to see good CGI and maximized use of slow-mo epic action scenes. With Barry's speed, the "poof" and sudden appearance of the people he's saved also adds to the comic effect, something the other shows don't have. <br/><br/>Overall, I think The Flash does a good job of balancing what's already out there. I love the Flash as it's a superhero TV show, and although it's not my favourite, I have to consider the audience it's meant for and how well it fairs in fulfilling its purpose. The Flash does this well, so it deserves an excellent rating. Had the misfortune of sitting through the first episode of 'Flash'. I had moderate expectations going into this on the basis of its IMDb rating. However, it turned out to be your average clichÃ©d, bore-fest. You have your typical teen drama, pathetic acting, and a boring main character. Avoid this if you value your time. It is beyond me how anyone could gain enjoyment form this crap. It has potential to be a great show for kids and childish, naive adults. Anyone over 18 who thinks this show is anything near 8/10, has either never seen a television show or movie in their entire life or has an abnormally underdeveloped brain. (stupid). Season 1: Great
Season 2: Meh
Season 3: Please god no
Season 4: Don't even bother
Season 5: Why is this still going?<br/><br/>
Season 1 and 2 were still focused on the Flash, went downhill from there with team ups drama and Iris. Iris killed the show for me.<br/><br/>I jumped ship mid season 3, it was getting worse by the minute, had a quick glance at the S3 end fight (was hoping that iris will somehow die and remain dead). Unfortunately she lives and is weaved more and more into main plots, while she is completely useless. <br/><br/>I started skipping every scene with iris in it since since season 2. Imagine my surprise when it literally had no impact on the story. <br/><br/>Hated her constant whining and drama. Worst character ever. Kinda sad that the actress had to do this. Not gonna bother with S4. Season 1 was great because iris was far away and we had Caitlin as well as focus on the main hero.<br/><br/>I suggest to watch Season 1 and 2 and then just stop. Unless you like the drama with Iris, then by all means go ahead. I thought shows like Reign, Star Crossed, 100, the Arrow et AL was the reservoir of bad writing and acting concentrated all in one place. But no, there are even more out there than first thought. Someone needs to send a swat team to the CW network and have all the writers and actors rounded up and sent to a uninhabited pacific Island. Then when they are done there, head over to the other three networks and round up the execs over there for their crimes for canceling really good shows of the Firefly caliber. <br/><br/>To try and even list the horrible things these shows all share would take a library of text to do. So maybe I can just list all the good things about this show and almost every show this network has produced in the past few years.<br/><br/>1)...<br/><br/>Well that is all I could come up with. This is an excellent series that really feels and looks good. Everything about it is good. The cast&acting is better then average. Every episode is action filled and has a villain in it witch is very good and makes me want to keep on watching. Can't wait to see how the flash keeps on progressing into something great. In my opinion The Flash is allot better then The Arrow. I really hope this series can keep on delivering and that there will be many more seasons to come. If you like comic book heroes,action & a tiny bit of romance then this is something for you. Also if you have watched Smallville or the arrow then this is the perfect combo of that. <br/><br/>I don't have much more to say other then keep up the good work. Here is an interesting show that surprised me from the beginning. I used to watched the old 1990 The Flash TV series, so my expectation were ordinary. I thought it was going to be just another reboot, but the different and original approach they took on Flash's background story, I actually began to like it more and more.<br/><br/>The characters are getting the screen time they deserve and the enemies are always interesting. Although the recipe of the story is a bit redundant from one episode to another (guy with superpower going nuts and Flash has to stop him over and over), I enjoy this show like a good dose of cheeseburgers. It calms my craving for adventure, action and little romance.<br/><br/>Grant Gustin didn't strike me as a good fit for the Flash at first but the more he got on camera and the better I understood why they chose him for the role. He has a strange and calm aura about him that reminds me (I don't know why...) of Richard Gere. Great intellect, soft and timid eyes, yet a man of action. Sureness and determination are making it work for him as an actor.<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to future episodes more than Gotham, which seem to be slowing down in ratings. I would give it a 8 of 10. One of the worstest comic series along with other cw shi##y shows.Waste of time I love this show! Its very creative, with characters that actually make wise and morally right decisions. Full of the beauty of depth of heart. I love a good storyline (which this show has), but just as importantly if not more so, I have to fall in love with the characters! I feel a genuine love and connection to all of the characters in The Flash. :) To everyone connected to the making of this show, hugs! Keep it coming! :) -- SPOILER ALERT -- <br/><br/>If you like drama, self guilt, meaningless situations, contradictory events, no-sense time traveling and really poor developed and depressed characters, this is your show. <br/><br/>I am writing this review from a script and cinematography and not a fanatic point of view. With that said, I've been watching this show since season 1, sometimes fast-forwarding episodes to make easier for my brain to digest the slow, cheesy, dramatic and pointless pace of the episodes and the show in general. <br/><br/>I just watch it to learn what not to do with an incredible superhero if I ever write a script sometime in my life. This show is a tutorial of "How to" destroy a character so much to the point of boredom. The cycle and sad events mixed with a whole bunch of other "speedsters" makes the main (and supposedly unique) character and hero of the show look like one more, but a really confused, lost and weak one, most of the time. Shame. <br/><br/>The dialogues are terrible, the acts are awfully directed and the character development is embarrassing at some points. The story plot is so weak, that makes you question almost every decision taken by the Team Flash and lifeless supporting characters. <br/><br/>The weekly evil meta human kids or crazy folks make the show predictable since the first minute of every single episode, and then maybe just waiting for an old character to appear surprisingly with probably other powers, that will become problematic so you'll have to watch 30 minutes of depressing dialogues between confused characters trying to fix a pointless problem that will be faded away into the room of darkness and forgotten stories of the show, all of this to make room to another pointless story next week, that will confuse you as much as the characters look.<br/><br/>Seriously, really bad and addictive for that reason. <br/><br/>Take two ! <br/><br/>1/21 in my Top of no-sense. Watching The Flash's Pilot made me want to write my first review ever.<br/><br/>As of how this series maintains a 9.0/10 avg rating from 2084 users is something I can only understand if all of its cast and their close relatives have been voting for it!!!<br/><br/>First of all let me say that I'm not a comic book fan but I enjoy the way comic book Super Heroes are depicted in today's Series, Movies, etc... <br/><br/>I found The Flash really annoying to follow. My main issue would be how fast the first episode/pilot is paced as it feels like the story jumps from one scene to another without any continuity or reason and way, way, way too fast, just as if they were trying to give the audience way too much information fitting way too many scenes in the first 45 minutes. The dialogs are a little bit forced, as they normally are in Comic Books, but in a TV series scenario they feel way too unreal given some situations.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the cgi effects are well executed and the acting is quite up to par. It feels as it has a decent cast choice (I guess all the bad actors were hired for Gotham).<br/><br/>I will be giving The Flash a second chance once they release the next episode, but should it fail to improve I doubt I will waste my time on a third episode.<br/><br/>CO To start with, The Flash was a pretty bad opening episode and if all following pistes are like this one, it will be a mockery of the great hero. You could get better acting talent from a school play and whoever was writing the dialogue shouldn't of been payed for what he delivered. The story showed all its card and was predictable. It didn't leave me wanting more, like it should have. i wasn't expecting some ground-breaking TV, but not this!!! However, one redeeming factor was the crime scene in the first 10-15 mins was quite good, with his thoughts being shown, but its far from original and can be seen in Fight Club. <br/><br/>Hope it gets better - fast (pun intended). J After being patient and watching season 1 and the first episode of season two, I hereby conclude that this show is predictable, and that means boredom. I believe anyone who was not a comics book fan before the show will agree, I mean how could they not? The first 10-15 episodes in season 1 is the same thing over and over again, no storyline is followed: a bad metahuman comes around, barry takes action and takes him down... jeez.. this predictability is what you get for excitement.<br/><br/>A good TV show should have a storyline from the very beginning, I can only imagine how many stopped watching this show early on. It gets interesting with the story of the reverse flash and Barry for a bit, but even then it's mostly fighting bad metahumans, in other words: back to the boring and predictable. When the reverse flash is killed at the end of the season, and season two starts off informing us that there is ANOTHER evil speedster, that was the end for me. The show is so unimaginative. Plus, one might argue the acting could have been better.<br/><br/>PS: not only are the episodes predictable in terms of action, but many lines as well. This "new" Flash is embarrassing. First they place what looks a "boy" for a "man".. The Flash is a man, not a boy. Most of the "characters" are youngish late teens early twenties.. and all of them are rocket scientists? Give me a break. This is for 'tweens (19 and under) not for adults with a brain. Barry Allen says (episode 4) the point is to "have fun" ... oh really? I thought the main reason was to study the effects of his new moronic speeds and save lives.. that is the point! In Episode 4, Captain Cold tells the Flash "aren't you past your bedtime?".. proving my point that he more like a boy than a man. Also, it seems that Barry Allen (Flash) does not follow the sound advice of The Arrow when Arrow tells him "guys like us, don't get the girl" though Allen still continues to chase his childhood sweet heart "Isis"... making the show even more ridiculous as The Flash has really never had a girlfriend. <br/><br/>In a strange twist, I did find Wentworth Miller (Captain Cold) very good at his villainous attitudes. Miller was great. But even the bad guys can't save this trashy teen-were-wolf type of show (fiction transformation). I rate it a 0, but Wentworth Miller gets a 10 for his role in episode 4. I am big DC comics book fan. I love the Flash, and I am very happy he finally got his own TV show. I hope he gets a movie soon. The TV show pilot episode was amazing! This is a great adaptation of DC comics Barry Allen. The show has a great story, music, characters, humor, everything about it is enjoyable. I am very excited for the show. I hope it stays on for a while, this is the type of TV I want to watch. Smallville was my favorite TV show, and now besides Arrow, I have found a new replacement for Smallville. Even though it is still early I am very excited for the flash. It has potential of being amazing show, and it was cool how they put John Wesley Shipp (the original TV flash) as Barry's father. CW is doing great work with arrow and now flash, just plain awesome. 10/10 Run Barry Run! I just love this show but the last episodes from season 6 had too much drama and it was a little bit too hard to watch. I hope season 7 it's better than this one and please LESS DRAMA! Come on, after the 3 season of Flash, it seems like a-silly-woman-with-incredible-feelings take over the control. At least Iris has beauty, but the given role to her and the others are relly annoying. Hope to writer will be gotten rid. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS SHOW. JUST DONT WATCH IT All of the DC shows are bad but this one stands alone for just how bad it is. No internal consistency, appallingly contrived storylines, pathetically convenient plot tools and horrible dialog.<br/><br/>It's like it was written as a low budget parody but couldn't make that stretch goal. I am going to be frank in my review. Please tell me how the most uneducated, unimpressive, unemployed, uninformed, unathletic and all around nag go from waitress to a lead reporter to a leader of the team?<br/><br/>Reading between the lines, I say Barry went to college on his inheritance, while Iris may have taken a few classes at a Junior College. Using the Lois/Superman angle she manages to become a valued reporter. Although, without formal education I am sure that someone at the paper was underwriting all of her material. It is the plot holes that make my mind go hunh?<br/><br/>In season 3, Iris became annoying. In season 4, she becomes an impossible nag. The nagging and whining is so annoying that I find myself fast forwarding through her dialog.<br/><br/>This material is supposed to be from a comic book. It is bad enough that movies and TV have update/evolve/change the character/comic book that made it famous in the first place. Comic fans do not need this type of aggravation. Boring and incredibly illogical. Outstanding acting from some, clashes so hard with dull and badly acted scenes from others. Unappealing characters, a constant nerdy feel and cringy sense of humor makes this series and absolute waste of time for me. Unpopular opinion, but here it is. If you love superhero shows and movies then "The Flash" is a show for you! Brings so much from the comics into the show and if you are a comic book nerd or just a superhero nerd in general it will make you feel all warm inside. They bring so much more then just the flash, other hero's have joined this series as well such as Firestorm, Vibe, Jay Garrick and more! Everyone that I have ever talked to about the show have all thought it was great, I mean I even got my grandma to watch it and she still loves it till this day. Once or twice a year they also team up with "The Arrow" cast and have cross over episodes which are great to see. Two shows colliding is always fun to watch. So if you are interested in this give it a shot you wont regret it. CAUTION:Before i start, if you truly believe this show is great,than it is great and don't stop believing in your dreams, hopes and aspirations. (Don't read this review if you can't handle an opinion)<br/><br/>When this show was first teased, i was anticipating a new, and interesting television series (as Super-hero shows had only become popular recently). Then i watched the pilot, and damn was i unimpressed. I stuck around to watch the rest of the first season in hopes it would improve, but it didn't. I am a comic book fan and don't care if it's DC or Marvel, but damn, Marvel is doing a much better job at producing quality entertainment. I don't blame DC though; i understand that it's not their fault. It is their fault, however, to allow companies like CW to handle their characters, because, currently, they are doing a very horrendous job of it. <br/><br/>When watching this show, you will be bombarded with bad acting (partially because of the horrible, horrible, HORRIBLE script), 'cringy' lines (awkward phrasing too), clichÃ©s, and dreadful story- lines. I understand this show has a low budget, but honestly, i think it would be cheaper to remove corny and 'cringy' lines like, 'Barry, you can do it. I believe in you because you are my friend' instead of keeping them.I made up that line, but seriously, it's pretty similar to what you're going to get when you watch this show. Now, i'm not sure if the writers of this show (and arrow, and other CW DC shows to come) are actually 12 year olds or believe most of their audience are twelve year olds. There is absolutely no subtlety in this show. Rather than using their 'excellent' acting skills to show emotions, and motives of a character, paragraphs on paragraphs of poorly constructed dialogue are used to describe how each and every character 'feels'. Then again, most of the target audience is 12 and under (i'm assuming here, since the quality of literally everything on this show is worse than that of a Disney XD cartoon), so i guess it would be smart to assume that they don't have the mental capacity to interpret anything. I'm giving this show a 3/10 rating and not a 1/10 because it satisfies a certain criteria on the 'good show' criterion:it has the astonishing ability to actually have viewers! WOT?!?!?!?!?<br/><br/>If you enjoy shows with crappy acting, half-baked story-lines, and corny one-liners, this is the show for you! To those who say, 'it's not that cheesy, wot are you talking about??', i say ignorance is bliss. I do enjoy the occasional 'ZOOM' and 'ZAM', which does make the show unique, but damn was that concept of speed as a power wasted on this production. This review could go on so much longer, but many other reviews have already covered other bad aspects of the show, ie. the inconsistency in Barry's abilities, etc. <br/><br/>If a show starts off every episode with, "I'm {*enter main character name here} and i'm the {*enter unique ability that main character has here}. {Enter whole life story that led to where you are now, who has betrayed you and why you need to avenge them, and etc here}' instead of having an intro, please, do yourself a favor and just stop watching. It's not worth the time, or the electricity costs to watch a 40 minute show on a standard TV/computer screen. The pilot of the show (episode 1) to be fair was good. And after watching episodes 2 - 4, unmasked the dummy that CW has sold us all. The casting is meeh (love Flash's crush - she's hot!), the effects are cool and that's where the positives end. The dialogue is mind-numbingly clichÃ©, the plot is stupidly simple and it's an exact copy-paste of Arrow meets Smallville.<br/><br/>Long story short, this is the stuff when you go to visit your girlfriend and she insists on watching it with you for you to get some after.<br/><br/>Overall rating 3.5/10. Probably might rise to 4. I so wanted to like this show, I really did. I love the Flash since my childhood, that's over 40 years. But this show is dumb.<br/><br/>Being a big fan of Sci-Fi, Fantasy and all kinds of superheroes, I usually have no problem with suspension of disbelief. It's a great thing for writers if they can imagine their own world with its own rules. That done, they should stick to those rules, not twist and bend them for a cheap effect or a deus ex machina "surprise" in each new episode.<br/><br/>Also there is little to no character development. All people in The Flash do is deliver stupid dialog and moralize about the obvious. Also, there's smiles. Smiles all around. Sweet smiles (aawww), bittersweet smiles (unrequited love etc, aww...). Once the smiling stops, everybody knows that the sh.. hit the fan.<br/><br/>After 16 episodes I'm sick and tired of this show. Even The Flash series in 1990 was more fun. Initially, I had some loathing for the film but I managed to surpass it and I watched two or three episodes then watched all the episodes. Like others said the first couple of episodes were boring but as you keep on watching it becomes very thrilling and trust me you will absolutely love it and you won't feel like doing your household chores or anything.<br/><br/>Another thing I love about the film is character development. The divergence of feelings amongst them just adds up everything! Grant Gustin perfectly plays the role of Barry Allen and is one of my favorite characters. Acting of other actors were stupendous! Just watch The Flash :) I just finished watching episode twenty-three of season one, and I can say with full certainty that I absolutely hate this series, and have made a resolve never to watch another single episode EVER again. I've been burned so many times its unreal. At the end of every episode I feel dazed and emotionless due to the stupidity and utter lack of thought which has gone into this series. Each episode, instead of getting better and more interesting, only amounts to more disappointment, anger, and despair. In this post I hope to share with you several reasons why. <br/><br/>For another take a look at the utter dryness of the characters in general, as well as a lack of personality of others. Many of the characters started out has hot-heads but then slowly degraded into talkative, moronic, frivolous patsy's. Take Iris for example, she's as stupid as she is self conceited, stubborn and selfish, but notice that over the course of the first season she did anything but improve, and towards the end seeing her stupid smiley face almost made me want to barf, even now it makes me shudder. And I'm thinking the whole time, "Barry actually likes this person? And then supposedly marries her in the future? Just how stupid do you have to BE to LIKE someone that stupid, dumb, and frivolous??" And NO, race has nothing to do with it, it could easily have been a blonde Caucasian and I would hate her all the same. Take Katelyn for another, she started out as a 'take no crap get it done hot head' tech-no chick, and then over the course of several episodes degraded into someone A-L-M-O-S-T as stupid as Iris. Other characters personalities stayed relatively static(sorta like Barry with his whiny, wimpy, cry baby personality), but only because their characters were so dry and inflexible to begin with. <br/><br/>For another take note of the redundancy, predictability, and overall rapidity of each and every episode, as well as how not super the main protagonist Barry really is. Each episode starts out about the same: opens up to Barry running, saying something stupid, then ends up at star labs. We then later see an evil meta-human rob a bank or something, while tons of security guards never think to draw their weapons or shoot(because the last thing we'd want to do is KILL the bad guys, they need love too). We then see Barry rushing to the seen of the crime. Usually he's too late but when he isn't we are forced to sit through an average of two minutes while we wait for him to stop getting beat up, and the bad guy to make his escape. The bad guy gets away while Barry and his tech-no buddies mope at star labs. Throughout all the episodes we are forced to sit through what seems like hours of the love triangle, divided between Barry, Iris, and that blonde haired police officer(who was so dumb that I really can't remember his name at the moment), as Iris' love goes back in fourth between the two, never once actually considering to make her decision and make a commitment to either man. After some more stupid stuff Barry catches back up with the evil meta human and gets beat up again, usually worse than the first time. He is then picked up unconscious later and brought back to star labs where they mope some more. After some more stupid stuff Barry catches back up to the villain and gets beat up, again, but some other person saves him and takes out the bad guy. Afterwards instead of putting a bullet into the villain's head, they lock him up into a containment cell that has no other apparent function as part of the particle accelerator, but serves as a convenience to the screen writers so they can spend more time on figuring out how to screw as many people as possible for the next episode. I could go on and on and on about this, but it serves to show my frustration about how unpleasant each episode is to watch, and how the Flash is so wimpy and useless as an actual superhero that he may as well not have his powers at all. <br/><br/>Another thing to consider about this series is all the plot holes. Now even the best books/movies will have at least a small one here or there, but the huge, gaping, plot holes which are littered throughout season one of The Flash are there because of the poor screen writing and story. Take for example when that one meta human steals Barrys speed powers. They eventually take him back to star labs and "jump start" his powers and bring them back by electrocuting him. However, note also that Professor Wells' also lost his original speed powers fifteen years prior, so all that time he never thought of trying that method to get his time travel speed powers back, and when he had seen how it worked on Barry he never tried it on himself? Just one of thousands of plot holes that are strewn throughout the series, and there are far too many to go over them all.<br/><br/>I'd mention more but I'm running out of time. It is enough to say that I hate this series on many different levels. I went into this series excited to have what I thought from the trailers must be a high quality special effects superhero TV show, but I left feeling stripped of my dignity, stripped of my trust in humanity in general, and indescribably frustrated I wasted so much time. The last episode of the series ended with a cliff hanger that I do not intend to follow into season 2, and if possible I will never again watch a DC comics TV show. I still don't get, how the marvel universe is so successful in movies\cartoons\TV series and other than Batman movies, DC keeps on failing time after time. Granted, Batman and Superman are the main faces of DC comics universe, but the flash is almost always had been a fan favourite. To make such a weeping, boring series, with terrible acting and nearly always, overacting, for such a lovable character is a crime. By the way, my grade of 5/10 reflects my utmost love for Flash himself as a character. Other than that, I'd give this series a 0/10. CW was better of focusing on developing Nolan' style batman world with flash in it. That would be a definite hit, and not this atrocity. Replace everyone, change the mood and maybe the series can be a hit. This show does what others do not. It remains lighthearted enough that not only is it fun to watch, but kids can enjoy it as well. Adults, remember back when you were a kid, and there was one truth: Superhero shows and movies brought out the wonder and imagination that made anything possible. They were kid friendly so our parents didn't have to worry about what the can watch. That is not true in today's society. There are great superhero media out today, on TV and in the movies, but they are often so far from being kid friendly that only teens and adults should be watching them. Daredevil and Jessica Jones pushes that into only adult territory. SHIELD is overly complicated and drawn out that only a mature mind can remain interested. Even this show's predecessor Arrow, is too violent, too complicated, and to adult. This show narrows the gap. It is mature, but light, fun and still interesting. It is a show that my child has no problem getting interested in, and doesn't get bored quickly from over-complicated story lines. Barry is just a very good guy, trying to help the public from the bad guys. Simple, straight forward, no muss no fuss. The stories are engaging. The childish glee of Barry and his friend Cisco are contagious. Even when things get serious, they don't throw frenetic temper tantrums at life in general. One of the best, if not THE best, superhero shows on today. Bring the kids, bring the popcorn and sit down for some family time, something that seems lacking in today's society. The whole reason I am giving this show a 10 over all. Is because I am super picky on the actor and actress names I know. I do not no many, you would think I live in a cave. But, I am actually a movie, t.v show, nerdy super-fan. If I think the actor is really good enough to the point it will not ruin the experience into me going into a "Fake" world. I will learn it. So I now know Grant Gustin also known as Barry Allen! The Flash! This show is amazing, it actually takes me into another world. I am on the floor staring at the screen screaming sometimes. You'd think I was watching football. I scream "Go get'em Barry!" or "Run Barry Run!" The character development for Barry Allen's story, will make you feel like you know Barry and he is your best-friend not Iris! You will also fall in love with his partners, Cisco for sure. You will be rooting for the flash from the beginning, crying when he cries and smiling when he smiles. The Flash is more than a superhero, he's the sweetest of them all. The actor nailed his role! Another awesome bonus is surprising guest which just makes everything that much more exciting! (Go producers!) I hope you give The Flash a chance, it's a show you most likely could watch again and again. Great 1st season. S2 has started on a very exciting note. s2e2 trailer is looking great. Contact with another earth will be awesome to watch given that in the first season they have kept it very tight. The graphics has been very good. Don't know what is going to happen to Dr. wells' character. I have not read the comic books, so i always look forward to the next episode anxiously. The character of Barry's adopted sister seems to be shortening each episode. may be there is not much for her to do & i don't really miss that character much. but i will surely miss Dr. Wells if he starts vanishing. Although they showed him in S2E1, but as his ancestor is dead, don't know whats gonna happen to him. I watched arrow.My god, was it awful.Then I started watching flash thinking that they did a better job.I am wrong.There is nothing but bitching and whining about how his superpowers are affecting him.This is a bad drama series.The formula for this show is this:every episode an antagonist will harm flash making him retreat.Flash will go and bitch about how he has to save the city to his crew.This is repeated forever.Why don't they read the comic and make a decent series.If you want to enjoy flash superhero character, watch Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox movie or justice league two earths movie or read the comics.If you really decided to watch this horrible series, just skip the to action scenes, they are somewhat good. Though I still enjoy the show, some of the writing has gone downhill in the last couple of seasons. At times, it's like the writer is not reading or watching other episodes and the show ends up with giant plot holes. At other times there are plot points and character arcs that are just so forced in order to get from point A to point B. As a viewer you just have to suck up the fact that some things just don't make sense even within the universe of the show.. All seasons had their moments! Especially season 1 and 2 where absolutely brilliant. Then Savitar came, De Voe after him , and then Nora working with the Reverse Flash. But then this season lacks of the element of anticipation, that feeling that you are looking forward to watching the next episode. No BIG villain , just a pretty lady that can jump into mirror dimensions and stuff. Oh and Barry is losing connect with the Speedforce , so he is loosing his speed. Again. It gets really exhausting and boring having to face this fact again. It's just sad that this show was so promising in the beginning, but in the end is fading away , placed by some lame writting and a few highlights. While the glory days of the Flash seem to be over, the show still has ways to go. Seasons 1-3 were a masterpiece. Unfortunately whatever writers were there for those seasons were traded away for writers who made the show a little bit worse.<br/><br/>Season 1 had an amazing storyline with the Reverse Flash killing Barry's mom in the past. The action, story, and characters were really on point. 10/10<br/><br/>Season 2 continued many of the great things in season 1 but this time with alternate dimensions and a scary villain Zoom. Another great season. 10/10<br/><br/>Season 3 in my opinion was the Apex of this show. Savitar was an amazing villain who was so threatening and powerful. The season long storyline was interesting. The show took a more dark tone this season but I liked that unlike most people who wanted the Flash to be a lighthearted show. 10/10<br/><br/>Season 4 had a considerable drop in quality. Iris became a very annoying character who should NOT have been the leader of team Flash. The season had some very bad villains, mainly the unbearable Amunet Black. This season also had some really bad episodes, especially Girls' Night Out, which featured some really cringy feminism. Finally the season long storyline wasn't very interesting compared to the previous seasons. 8/10<br/><br/>Season 5 improved upon season 4. The show got more exciting, the Reverse Flash returned, and the season long storyline was better. Still the show had problems. The main villain, Cicada, was horrible (especially the actor), and should've been killed off way earlier than the finale. Nora acted like a 16 year old despite she was supposed to be in her mid twenties. Also some of the villains were underwhelming. Still pretty great with an amazing finale. 9/10<br/><br/>Season 6 so far has been okay. The main issue is the cast is very bloated this season. The show tries to get you to care about characters like Chester, Allegra, and Kamilla, but these characters have little to no screen time and they have no depth. Even members of the main cast like Ralph only appear sporadically. The villains of the week are also really forgettable. Hopefully this season picks up in the last third. I watched this about 2 years then lost interest. Tried to watch it again but lost interst. It became so boring. Wath me copy paste this review from arrow The Flash you need to give a rating based in each season:
1 season: great season, great actuation you can see perfectly, rating: 9,5
2 season: start to out down, but still great, rating: 9,0
3 season: several people speak this season was bad or terrible and for me was very great, rating: 10
4 season: worst season ever, unnecessary season, serious go to last episode to start the season 5, rating: 2,5
5 season: well, coming from the 4 season is better, but it's not like begin, rating: 7,0
6 season (until now): I was thinking this would be bad, but is good, I feel they are trying to fix their mistakes in last two seasons and the first part start weak but cool, rating: 8,5.
4 and 5 season was the worst so you can skip to 6 season and you can like to watch The Flash again!
I still looking the TV series, so my final ratings is 8,0 in my opinion the TV series is good and you can watch yet, have stories yet specially 6 season now and if help you, the flash have the biggest ratings of CW since 2014 (18-49, viewers and DVR) so you can watch yet again! This show has it's good moments, but mostly, it's just bad. It's always dragged out unnecessarily, with it's Cannon-fodder-per-episode villains. The science is just completely broken in this show. I know it's a show about a man running FTS, but they try to explain things scientifically and they fail. The story suffers from being spread too long on 23-too-many episodes. This show is for those who don't care about good graphics, good story & memorable characters(I hate Joe and his stupid laugh & I fountain of expendable Wells(es).). This TV series had a good engaging storyline and I think this is the best TV series I ever seen . Trust me guys.ðŸ˜Š We have such a hard time finding good content that isn't filled with cursing and sex scenes. TV-MA is ruining family TV time. We watch as a family and this show hits the sweet spot between engaging, interesting content and clean enough for our tweens to watch with us. These superheroes struggle and love and get frustrated just like we all do. We love watching The Flash together!! Arrow was great but this is the best show ever. The show is perfect actors to plot every seasons villian keeps ya at the end of your seat I found the Flash to be quite an enjoyable TV show during the first season, given the fact that the hero is pretty overpowered and kind of difficult to put him in tough situations because of his power set.<br/><br/>But after season 1, that came with quite a compelling villain and a great actor who perfectly fleshed out the role, things went downhill pretty fast...<br/><br/>There are a lot of problems with this show, so i am going to be quick about it:
1) Way too many plot holes (that remain unaddressed).
2) A lot of filler episodes
3) Repetition that almost touches autistic levels.
4) Disgustingly stupid situations
5) Main character with long term memory issues
6) Too much drama<br/><br/>In depth:<br/><br/>1) Who pays for Star Labs operations? Why is it so easy to access it? Why don't they do something about it? How can the team of specialists build interdimensional communicators but not simple gadgets to protect the Flash from things that might catch him off guard? These and many others.<br/><br/>2) Way too many of these, with plot lines that have a dead end and emotional outbreaks and complications that simply vanish after the episode ends and are never brought up again or even seem to affect the future storylines.<br/><br/>3) The main source of problems in the Flash's team, is "the secret". Whenever a situation arises, it is mostly due to someone "keeping a secret" and not sharing with the team. Then there is the drama where the secret gets out and people feel offended, then they talk in through and then they find the solution. And then it happens again. And yet again. There it is again. Its almost like the characters never learn from their mistakes, which translates to no character growth.<br/><br/>4) As everyone in the review section will point out, the Flash is fast enough to dodge lightning bolts that are 2mm away from his head, yet there are people who will utilize bees and car toy bombs to fight him, and that somehow gives him trouble. Or how at times, when he has a 1st run in with a character who could actually neutralize him, he gets beat and then during their second show off, he will get to the bad guy, make his presence known by saying something cheesy usually and then wait for guy to do his moves before he even thinks of taking him down. He travels through time and faster than the speed of sound, yet has problems catching flying debris from a car crash. Its just absolutely mind boggling.<br/><br/>5) Barry keeps making the same stupid mistakes over and over again. He never learns, he acts as if he has learned his lesson, and then back at it. Just like a teen in high school who got caught spraying the bathroom.<br/><br/>6) At times this feels more like a soap opera than a superhero show. I can't begin to explain, just know that if you watch, you are in for A SHIT TON of drama.<br/><br/>I am quite a fan of superhero shows/movies but, in regard to the CW shows, they have a taken a turn for the worse. Maybe i am not the target audience but from a quality perspective, they have been reduced to garbage. They treat the viewer as if his IQ is lower than a tree trunk. And the writers don't even seem to be trying. They just come up with an idea, forget to examine it, and just shove it into the plot.
The actors aren't that great, with a few exceptions, but they are not bad either. If you take into account the "over the top" tone of the show, its excusable.<br/><br/>Overall, if you value a superhero TV show with a thought out plot, good characters and nicely digestable content, i suggest you dodge the 3 last seasons of the Flash. The Flash started out amazing I loved the first two seasons. Season 3 was way to dark for The Flash and Season 4 was to corny. I just wish they'd get back to Season 1 & 2 quality. I blame The CW and their Teenage Shows they shouldn't have the rights to DC shows. Particulary loved seasons 1 and 3. Not sure whats up with the other reviewers, but my family and I love Iris West, She provides a great balance to the show. <br/><br/>both my family and my extended family watch. keep up the good work! I would give up on this show if I didn't want to see what obscure villain they pluck from the DC universe to pit against the Flash. I love the character of Flash. His appearances in all DC animated shows and movies are fun and exciting. Too bad this doesn't translate in live-action. I just don't get the same thrill. I do get that thrill when the Arrow shoots an arrow on the live-action Arrow. I would watch an animated series The Flash.<br/><br/>Stories are OK here, I think the cast kills it. Barry/the Flash is good. But the rest? Firstly, that actor who played ED on the TV show ED, I've always found annoying. Secondly, the cop who played a cop for a long time on Law and Order is too distracting. Whenever I see him, I think I've switched to the A&E channel, or whatever channel airs reruns of Law and Order. I mean, he dresses and talks, and is seen in exactly the same kind of setting. But if you didn't watch L&O...who cares? Not into any of the supporting cast, except maybe Cisco is OK.<br/><br/>I'll screen the shows for appearances of bad guys and the special effects, but will ultimately give up on this show the way I gave up on Smallville. I'll re watch Young Justice for my speedsters kick. And cont. to watch Arrow, which has a good cast.<br/><br/>Could be worse though. In the beginning, I thought the acting was sub-par and that the story seems pretty boring. I'm warming up to all of the characters, especially Barry. I'm still a little turned off by Caitlin and Iris just seems like another Laurel (there for emotional investment, vapid as a character). Tom Cavanagh is the exception to all of this. I think he's a great character and I would love to see where he develops.<br/><br/>The one thing this show does well - which is what keeps me coming back - is that they have the cheesy, awkward humor down perfectly. It's very true to the comic atmosphere and I think Grant Gustin was a great choice for Barry. <br/><br/>My favorite part of this show so far have been a short guest appearance from Green Arrow and longer guest appearance from my favorite Arrow character. So... as far as The Flash itself, I guess I'm just not invested in anyone, yet. I will watch a few more episodes and see what they can do. lost interest in this show after Barry revealed his identity to Iris. After that moment the show become ridiculous. The writers have lost the plot Too many speedsters, The Earth 2 narrative, lack of imagination, and the fact those associated around Allen have developed super powers are a few reasons why we do not waste any time watching this poorly written TV Show. What started out reasonable, different and actually not too bad, until!! what i can only assume, writers of another horrible TV Show, "The Arrow" have obviously been recruited to write episodes for The Flash and the outcome is laughable far fetched and ultimately awful. I watched the pilot episode, it's not that bad has far as comic book shows go. Grant Gustin has the main lead is affective in the role, not to mention he looks like Andrew Garfield's kid brother. The writers made him pretty likable and someone for the audience to identify with.<br/><br/>The effects are pretty well done, and the hero's outfit looks pretty satisfying, almost similar to Daredevil(2003). The rest of the cast are memorable also. I really don't mind a new retelling of the fastest DC superhero, but in some parts I can't help but feel they where turning The Flash into another Batman, but has the series goes I hope they come up with clever story lines, Has for 1990 version of The Flash, feeling like they didn't know exactly where to go with that one.<br/><br/>But I hope this show will go in many places, and there is a twist en voling a certain character. I started watching this because i was fooled by some reviews that said the show starts to be more interesting after the first five or six episodes. Well, that is not true. I don't know how but I made it to the 10th episode. The writing is so bad. From the beginning they think you are a stupid 10yo viewer. Also, the storyline in some episodes makes no sense at all, like in the end of the episode the bad guy just appears locked up in the good guy's facilities, but nobody shows you how he got there or how that happened. And you think: "So they were after this bad guy all episode and now he just got locked up in the prison? What the hell? Did I missed something?"<br/><br/>Seriously, don't watch this. Don't waste your time. If you want to watch something from Marvel, go watch Daredevil, which isn't as bad as this. It's just really good, that's all there is to it. It's a 'must watch' TV series. If you like watching supernatural films and shows or superhero related content then this is the show for you. The Flash connects with other DC/CW shows such as Arrow, Supergirl and Legends of Tomorrow, I believe some others too, so if you watch this I recommend you watch their other shows to get the full understanding of the story as they connect with each other.<br/><br/>10/10. Watch The Flash, Legends of Tomorrow, Supergirl and Arrow, and when you're done after watching over 200 hours worth of fun, you will come back and you will be speechless. It's soo good! I have never written a review before but the quality of this show compelled me to warn others. Everything wrong with this show has been stated multiple times by other negative reviews and it's all true. The actors, the acting, the scripts, the consistency... all of it is either bad, terrible or non existent. They recycle characters constantly. Nothing the flash ever faces is really a challenge. Watching this show is like you are stuck in a pool of urine up to your neck then somebody comes in with a bucket full of feces to dump on your head. Do you duck down under the urine or do you stay up and take on the feces? They could have done so much more with this show. It has such awesome potential. I actually have no idea how they made it so poorly. I would love to ask the writing team. If you watch it for more than the first season you will come to the same conclusion. Anyone who is rating this show highly should come clean and admit they have not watched more than a few episodes or admit that they are so jaded by superhero shows and movies they can't resist but leave high ratings. <br/><br/>Wait for the remake in 10 years. It could not possibly be any worse. The Flash was always one of my favorite DC superheroes. So I had high hopes for this series. Early episodes were a bit silly, but entertaining. Gustin is an unconventional choice to play the lead, but he's doing a good job. I'd have liked to see more of the original Carmine Infantino style, but the show has a pretty reasonable look and feel to it.<br/><br/>But after two seasons, all the early promise has been stamped out. The big story arcs are endless, boring and ridiculous. After the second or third time the Flash surrendered the instant a villain took one of his friends hostage, I knew the writers were all out of ideas. The various family sub-plots are going nowhere, and all we've got left is a mess of artificial angst. (Not quite as bad as Arrow, but getting there.)<br/><br/>The Flash has that comic-book look and feel, but it's paper-thin. It's amazing how a show can try so hard to kindle some real emotion, and fail so miserably. Unless you can be vastly entertained by the mere sight of a guy running around in tight-fitting red leather, I'd say forget this Flash.<br/><br/>DC is still floundering for an identity, on both the small and big screens. So far, its only unqualified success - Gotham - is probably the most overlooked.<br/><br/>UPDATE: The recent musical cross-over with Supergirl forced me to watch one episode of The Flash. It was almost unbearable. The series has descended to even lower depths of awkward cliché and implausible characterization. Avoid at all costs. This could be a wonderful show for kids if it was screened in the frame-world of the Flash but alas this is not that world. However, fortunately for the producers of the Flash, there are unwitting adults in our world who have propelled this show to a rating of 8.2 when it deserves a 5 at best.<br/><br/>I was introduced to this show by an unwitting adult who was a colleague. I curse the day I allowed myself to be coerced into this foolhardy series that has turned into a cult favorite - Favorited by morons. My first reaction to the flash was, "why does like say like in every sentence. Is that supposed to like represent a cultural shift where like people speak like that all the time?" <br/><br/>Dialogues: Despicable, Nausea inducing the writers of the show should write a book. I believe they are truly geniuses. In my country, we have a best selling writer that sells s**t for stories. He is an MBA graduate and an Engineer. Why I mentioned him is because the dialogues his characters deliver are better than the ones i've heard in this show. "Run Barry Run." "Yes" Do you like wanna go get a coffee or something? <br/><br/>They have turned Barry Allen into a desperate nitwit with a fast forward button for a brain. <br/><br/>Filler Episodes: Can you like stop with the fillers already. We're like super tired.<br/><br/>Do I need to like, say more? 70% of the show focuses on fillers whereas the main plot goes seeping through the drain. <br/><br/>Time travel, Many dimensions: Count on Harry to explain it using the white board and a sharpie. Even though none of it makes sense, at least Tom Cavanagh can act. By enunciating every word that is supposedly imp-ort-ant. Now repeat after me, I am a dumb ass. Good. There are multiple earths and we can travel through time though there will be irreparable consequences if we so. The simple knowledge of such a world and it s working can alter our reality. Understood? OK now lets go and Wreck havoc while we're at it. Oh, almost forgot, Barry don't forget to kiss Iris while we're there, lol. Be-cause we all know that you're never getting that in this world. There must be something in the CW Network's drinking water: nearly ALL their superheroes are angst-ridden - and slow. And the Flash moves slower than the hour it takes to move thru one episode. It must be the lot of those of us who have been reading comic books for century, that when a series is made, we find nothing resembling the original. And so it is with The Flash. The secret identity? None. Exactly the same as Supergirl, where at least 10 people in the lives of the protagonist know his "secret identity." The Flash, along with other DC heroes featured on CW, comes equipped with a "team" who help them. The team always has one or two geniuses barely past puberty, who cannot seem to think ahead, despite that genius. Cisco is absurdly dumb. blurting out Barry's name in front of Kendra, and, when confronted with a dangerous foe, is not smart enough to get out of the way, instead preferring the "Dude-you-are-going-down" approach, as though he's speaking to a high school rival. Barry is hopeless in battle, as is Supergirl: punch, stop, wait to get knocked down, gets whipped the first time. Repeat as needed until the last 10 minutes when he finally wins - not because of his speed (the "real" Flash could circle the Earth in less than a second: Barry takes an average of two minutes to arrive anywhere in the same city). Iris goes from a blog to becoming a reporter for the largest city newspaper in the space of two months. Her acting is passable, but no more than that, as is Barry. The writing is weak, and for people who work as detectives, they are astoundingly slow to arrive at conclusions and, the whole team could do with some quick thinking, which is not their forte. A barely passable series with poor writing, and certainly not written for adults with any deductive capabilities. I tried very patiently sitting through the first 4 episodes of The Flash 2014.<br/><br/>Man, it was an excruciating experience. The writing is just atrocious. The acting is mediocre. The directing is abysmal. <br/><br/>I am astonished why horrid shows like these are so popular.<br/><br/>Okay, The Flash is about this 10 year old school girl named Barry Allen. Yes, he acts like a 10 year old school girl that likes to just run around the corner really fast. She'll be coming around the corner really fast when she comes. <br/><br/>And then after running around like an idiot, he likes to hold hands with killers, instead of putting them away for good. You know---so the killers can go killing a lot more people over and over again.<br/><br/>Oh, wait. I forgot this show was targeted at 10 year old school girls. <br/><br/>So if you are not a 10 year old girl, don't waste your time watching this garbage. <br/><br/>If you are into more mature shows like The Walking Dead, Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, The Leftovers, Dexter, Banshee, Daredevil, Homeland, do not watch The Flash. <br/><br/>The Flash was written either by a 10 year old school girl or a retarded adult. Either way, it's a real pathetic excuse for a show. First two season were great.season 3 and 4 were good also.but then it became booring,same thing over and over and the story was not good at all.casts were not good at all from season 5 to season 6 At first, I really liked this series. It had a likeable protagonist, a promising villain and some good characters. But as the show advanced, it became a soap opera with super powers. The characters make dumb moral decisions for the sake of conflict. The characters stoped developing and now, they are basically reset every episode. Because what this show does is, every episode the characters face a different internal conflict. And when you make 6 seasons of it, it becomes really predictable, and repetitive.<br/><br/>AND DONT GET ME STARTED ON THE SPEECHES.<br/><br/>Every single Episode they have at least 2 pep talks or inspirational speeches. I could elaborate on all the other problems, but it would take too long.<br/><br/>With that said, it is still pretty entertaining, the plot is not in a nonsensical level, and I still watch it when I have nothing else to do The Flash season 6 does not compare well to the rest of the series. This season is very disorienting with multiple villains but no true plot. The first half provided some entertainment until we reached crisis on infinite earths, but those like me who found that special enjoyable will find out that watching the rest of the season to be worse than watching paint dry. Sure there were some memorable moments, but, season 6 primarily focuses of relationship team Flash shares compared actually telling the story of the hero. I find it very disappointing that the same story will continue because this season introduces complete failure for team Flash against Mirror Master. Sure you see The Reverse Flash and Godspeed, but it mainly revolves one woman's predictable vendetta against her husband. No cliffhangers which is very unlikely for this show and there are no moments that provide humor as well. The producers are obviously running out of ideas, which promotes the failure the Arrowverse will undergo which is a shame. It had a lot of potential but the problem also comes from the long seasons being nearly 20 episodes each. So here is for the viewers who didn t watch the flash and are wondering if it s worth the time or not.
I recommend this show. It s great, full of plot twists and so on. But I only recommend the first 3 seasons out of 6, and the third one is not the greatest.
A big problem is that they want you to watch all the other DC productions(you get this feeling especially in season 3). You even have to skip to the series called:"Supergirl" or "Green Arrow" to understand what is going on or what happened in the previous episode.
But all in all, the first 2 seasons are a 10/10 and I highly recommend it. A lot of people say that season one was amazing or that the first two seasons were good and then it started to go downhill. I think it started to go downhill mid-season 1. It's like the writers struck gold with a good story and then they just hastily and carelessly added the fillers. Pretty much all of the details are crap. The lack of logic is painful. You can't even say that the plot has holes. You get to a point were you think there's a bit of plot around a bunch of holes. Everybody's stupid and lies the people around them all the time, doing stupid things that endanger everybody and make no sense. The Flash is faster than lightning and bullets, but he can't outrun a swarm of bees or a lot of other slow moving stuff. Yeah, they let Iris get a shape shifter to the police in the back of her car cause she insisted. Cause she just happened to be in the lab where she casually walked because it's just possible to walk in a high tech lab like you enter a supermarket. Cause it makes sense. And the military wanted to catch a meta human so they just started shooting a bar, killing all the civilians and then nobody bats an eye about it or holds the general responsible. So dumb... It's this kind of details that killed it for me and I'm done by the end of season one. It's just enough to watch until you feel like you are seriously wasting your time. This has been a great show starting of strong with a great cast lead us on a great journey then the cross overs started, this last cross over has made all of these show terrible the story lines now are weak and childish supergirl and the flashes costumes look like potato sacks , they look awkward and uncomfortable in there costumes and it shows on screen , It all needs a make over ...because this show is the definition of recycling. Recycling old characters, thematic elements, plot points and pretty much anything else. Only the first two or three seasons were worth it. The show ended in with the recent "Crisis on Infinite Earths". It wrapped up the storyline we have all been following regarding Barry disappearing into the speed force.<br/><br/>And now we have garbage. I only give this show 3 stars because it was a good show initially; it was lighthearted, goofy, and was never too serious. Which matched the character of The Flash from the comics because he was always kind of goofy and just a fun character.<br/><br/>A lot of people took issue with the casting of Iris. I didn't care that she looked nothing like the Iris from the comics. But recently her character is becoming ridiculous; "TEAM CITIZEN!!". Her self righteous," I'm a reporter, I have to do this or that"...we aren't tuning it to watch three women, clearly chosen for the roles due to their 'diversity', go running around on a SJW campaigns with their super powers of THE PRESS!!! We already had the force fed LGBTQ campaign with their daughter, Iris.<br/><br/>So really, just another fail from the CW for turning their DC brands into vehicles for relationships, forced diversity and "girl power!". They had the formula right the first few seasons. Now the show has run its course to me.<br/><br/>One question I have for the CW is "Do you hate the DC Universe"? Because one of their most successful shows, "Supernatural", which has been a reliable series for over 10 years now, has effectively remained so popular because it stayed AWAY from politics. Maybe the writers at the CW should do the same for their DC shows. It's from the rare series I've watch it and didn't get bored it's fantastic and amazing I really liked this show until about season four; it's lost something. They picked a good cast and the plots are very well done. But I find the show is becoming rushed, too much action all the time and lot of the same issues are being repeated, but slightly changed. It gets exhausting. Grant Gustin's take on Barry Allen isn't bad but its definitely not like the comics. He's not funny or quick witted. Not necessarily a negative but not a positive either. Good plots and villains. Just alot of unnecessary drama that really slows everything down. Allen is always crying around about something This show used to be really good very entertaining at fist but over the seasons it has changed A LOT so much drama in these last series its not even enterataining anymore, writers have to change somethnig about it same things are happening over and over , i cant even remember how many times flash and that poor dad fought in this season already and main fight is still yet to come.
most stupid scenes are when flash runs to this dad to stop him but gets his powers taken off and nearly dies. this is so stupid and he does that cople of time when will he realise that if he runs to him he wont be able to stop him with his powers and it is pointless to do that huh? so stupid script and writing is just poot these days i hope things change and return to being somewhat realistic. I've been following this show since it's start and it's great, the episodes always are entertaining and humorous. Season 4 was bit of a miss but I think it's coming back! Great show. Flash started out so good, but with each new season it becomes more of a soap opera than anything else. Let's talk about your feelings, blah blah blah.<br/><br/>Additionally, these people are suppose to be brilliant, but everyone else in the world can figure things out before they do. OMG, it's painful waiting for them to catch up. Where do they get the money from? Is everyone living off Barry's pay? Barry has the best job in the world too, he doesn't even need to show up unless he feel like it. Where do I get a job like that?<br/><br/>Because this is on the CW, we need to insert a gay character now, and might as well make her African-American, and from the future. The CW ensures that every single show they air has a cast that looks like the United Nations, and a gay or trans or whatever.<br/><br/>I do not have a problem with diversity or equal rights. In fact, I think it is long over due. I do however have a problem with networks shoving in my face constantly. I want to watch a super hero show, not Dawson's Creek.<br/><br/>I tried watching that new Charmed show because I loved the old show. Good Lord, that show is "In your face" PC crap. Lines like "I don't need a man to open a door". Also, they just had to make a sister gay. Plus they can't make the sisters white, so they made them....whatever the heck they were.<br/><br/>Anyways, watch the first couple seasons of The Flash, then find something else to watch. If you like adventure, drama and science fiction series, this is for you. The flash is a fantastic series that makes you believe in the impossible! Grant Gustin acts fantastic, and also the other characters are perfect and make you live the story. The flash is a series that keeps you on the edge of your seat! It's worth watching. I only watched the first 2 seasons of the flash before I stopped because there were some things I didn't like about the show (like how King Cold was able to even fight with Flash when he is just a just a guy with a gun and Barry has super speed), but it had some redeeming qualities as well like H. Wells character, and the arc where Barry was investigating reverse flash then it was revealed that H. Wells was him.. I swear that was the best season in my opinion, followed by the 2nd one. Anyway, eventually I stopped because other shows caught my attention and I wanted to binge them. And I was thinking about continuing where I left off but after seeing all these reviews about how the show is a bit annoying now and how it's give Iris a bigger role I don't think I'm going to continue afterall. I didn't really like Iris but she didn't have a lot of screen time so it was bearable, I don't think I'll be able to watch this show now that she has more screen time. Some reviews also mentioned someone named Nora and she is supposedly just as annoying as Iris, if not worseðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ #ripflash I know I'm laughing but it's actually sad that the flash has become what it's become. I'm a bit disappointed actually, I was expecting the other seasons to be as good as the first but it looks like the Flash has dropped in quality. Season 1 of the flash absolutely made every one fall in love with the series AND Season 2 and 3 didn't disappoint season 4's plot was satisfying enough but after season 5 and the current season are a disappointment so if it continues like this it's better to not go through with season 7 there is no satisfying plot like the earlier seasons the writers have run out of ideas either bring fresh blood in or just cut it off but I will give 6/10 because of the earlier seasons the good times so now I don't reccomend viewing the flash as it is dry boring and basically plotless with too many villains that don't even make sence I'm sorry for my English<br/><br/>When I started watch the flash increased my interest in comics and after the flash I started reading comics. Just a really bad show. no story....junk!!! Just a bunch of made up random episodes with bad acting. But nooooo story.... This show is great if you can remove all sense of logic and reasoning... Just put those on the coffee table and soak in the suspense and action.<br/><br/>Every episode is filled with plot holes and "Why would you not do *this*?"<br/><br/>I wish the writers would consult someone with common sense before releasing scripts What an fall .... .ehm fail<br/><br/>
you failed this show.. its getting wores i can only watch it with 1,5 playing speed time while simultaneously playing on my mobile phone Well I'm done with this show how many people have to die before they fight pack. They let people die just so they don't have to kill can you stupid if you ask me. Need to get some better writers. Has anyone else noticed how much stronger the chemistry between Caitlin and Barry is than Barry and Iris? They have all these moments where it's SO OBVIOUS they should be together. Plus, Iris is much better at being a best friend than a wife to Barry imo.<br/><br/>Caitlin has lost so much throughout the course of this show. Her husband died, she was betrayed, she was lied to, but she moves on. She doesn't accuse. She doesn't complain. (Unless she's being controlled or something.)<br/><br/>Iris, on the other hand, does both of these things EXCESSIVELY. She doesn't stop to think how other people must feel. I mean no offense to anyone acting in or working on this show, I'm just bothered that they didn't take advantage of the obvious connection between Barry and Caitlin. They even tried something similar with the shape shifter meta in season 1, where he pretended to be Barry. I think Caitlin realized she genuinely felt something for him at that moment.<br/><br/>Other than all of this, I do like the show. I know it's way past too late to change anything like that, but even so, I'd like to know I'm not the only one that saw this. I love this show. It has a great cast with good chemistry. It has action, villains, solving crimes, catching bad guys and lots of clever comedy, the kind of comedy that get you b/c you don't see it coming.
I'm not a comic book or superhero person in any way, so I steered clear of shows like this.
> Then i watched Agents of Shield and loved it, which then led me to watch, Gotham, The Arrow, The Flash, Legends of Tomorrow and Supergirl. All of which I liked and suggest you watch .
FYI, If you would have told me 6 months ago that I'd like The Flash or any comic book/superhero show, I would have laughed in your face.
> Hate to say it but it goes back to the age old saying, " don't judge a book by its cover."
I judged these shows b/c they were superhero shows, and I did t think I liked shows like that.
I was wrong....very wrong !! With every episode this show is getting worse and worse . People die and come back which is getting really boring and I feel like no one can actually DIE. Just don't bother watching this show at all. It has gotten a little worse from it's earlier season's but still a great show. Also season 5 seems to be better than seasons 3 and 4 so far so that's good! I really enjoyed the beginning of this series, but the cheesy and horrible acting by Wentworth Miller, Dominic Purcell and Mark Hamill really took away from the show near the end of the first season. Bad acting or bad directing, it doesn't really matter. It takes away from the show. I'll start off with this. I like the show and have watched it all the way through. There are some formidable villains and some pretty decent action. The Flash uses the full extent of his powers well but it takes a little while of watching to really get there.<br/><br/>There are a couple problems I have with this series but the biggest of them all is the character of Iris West. She simply needs to stop talking in "what ifs" and stop dragging the show down. She seems to stick her nose in stuff that she doesn't need to get into. She created unneeded drama every step of the way, especially in the later seasons. <br/><br/>The other problem I have is that the show isn't as jovial and comedic as I wanted out of a Flash tv show. Growing up seeing The Flash as a joking, cocky superhero, it's hard to see this Flash as a moody, soft, boyish kid. Comedic elements are quite prevalent in the character of Cisco Ramone and another character in season 4 (no spoiling).<br/><br/>These, after all, are just opinions. But many other reviews on here tell a similar story to mine. Flash is one of my favorite superheroes and I don't think they quite do it the way I envisioned the tv show would be. Overall, I still enjoy the villains, action, and the drama is pretty good once you get used to it. I have read almost all flash comics since the fifties (the seventies were the best). And I would take almost any of them over your writers. They have no imagination using other speedsters as villains then using the time lines to bring them back. Have the writers stop using the time lines because they are idiots. The reverse flash is from the future and also called zoom. When his ancestor Eddy Thorn kills himself there is no reverse Flash in the future. But your writers say oh this was before Eddy killed himself? He couldn't even have been born? Barry would never tell a villain to kill his parent, because he was losing memories. Lose memories or lose parents . oh he will have parents die. Oh by the way reverse flash was from same time line even worse from future with no ill effects. Every season episodes has to a speedster even if the bring him back to life. What ever happen to mirror master who steps through dimension or Abra Kadabra. Why not have a hour show trying to save every one on a sinking ocean liner? Because No imagination! I was a big fan of this show the first time around. I was already something of a comic fan, and this series was a great translation of the material into a series. The Flash was a great-looking show, and the actors played their parts flawlessly. John Wesley Shipp, who played the Flash, has that Bruce Campbell-like ability to portray a likable, average guy, who just happens to get super powers. His sidekick, the lovely Amanda Pays (formerly of Max Headroom) was a good, but underused, addition to the show.<br/><br/>The special effects were surprisingly good for a TV show, although I do seem to remember some wince-inducing moments, like one villain whose costume included - unless my memory is really messing with me, which has been known to happen - a Nintendo Power Glove.<br/><br/>On the subject of villains, they were usually done well. I highly recommend the episodes starring Mark Hamill as the Trickster. Fans of the animated Batman series will notice an early version of Hamill's Joker persona here, which is interesting since the Flash comics' Trickster character was basically a rehash of Batman's Joker in the first place.<br/><br/>All in all, this show really didn't deserve to get canned after one season. Given another season, it could have grown into something classic. Luckily, videos of this seem fairly easy to come by, so it's still possible to check out this underrated footnote in the history of superhero television. The CW's latest superhero series is THE FLASH, based on the long running DC comic; the character of Barry Allen, a forensic investigator, was given a try out on THE ARROW last season, so fans got a sneak peak and knew what the expect. This was one of the few new shows this season that I was actually looking forward to seeing, and it did deliver on its promise. Unlike GOTHAM, over on FOX, it didn't try to pack too much into the first episode. <br/><br/>The thing I liked most about the show was that it had a hero who actually seemed to get a kick out of having super powers and enjoyed thwarting the bad guy. Barry Allen's The Flash is a good contrast to Oliver Queen's the Arrow (who has a nice cameo) who is all grim determination over in Star City. In casting Grant Gustin, they made Barry a lot younger than he was in the comic books, but what did anyone expect from The CW; the mysterious death of his mother and the unjust imprisonment of Barry's father is the Big Dark in this Flash's past, but it does not consume him the way it does for some other super heroes (talking about you Batman).<br/><br/>The other good thing about THE FLASH is how the creators are trying to work the larger DC universe into it, with it gallery of Meta Humans and Super Villains. The explosion at STAR Labs, which gave Barry his super speed, has released alien energies into Central City and presumably the wider world, and though the laboratory mishap is an old comic book trope, it still gets the job done when it comes to creating plot possibilities. In the pilot we saw Barry take on The Weather Wizard, and the previews gave us a glimpse of Wentworth Miller's Leonard Snart aka Captain Cold. This season also promises appearances by Heatwave, Firestorm, General Eiling, and a return of THE ARROW'S Clock King, played the superb Robert Knepper.<br/><br/>There is a good supporting cast headed by Jessie Martin as Detective West, whose daughter Candace Patton is the love interest; true fans will remember John Wesley Shipp, who plays Barry's incarcerated father, as playing The Flash in a short lived 1990 TV show. Tom Kavanagh is Harrison Wells, the head of STAR Labs and Barry's benefactor, but in what has become a clichÃ© for these kind of shows, is revealed in the final scene to be not the man he appears to be (maybe ZOOM, the reverse Flash). <br/><br/>The CGI was pretty good for this kind of show; the fans standards are pretty high these days, especially after seeing Quicksilver in X- MEN:DAYS OF FUTURE PAST.<br/><br/>I first encountered The Flash long ago in a great cartoon on Saturday morning, and I still think animation is the best way to do super heroes, but this live action Flash is a good effort. And while we're on the subject, will someone please bring back Saturday morning cartoons. Yes, I know, the fanboys are not going to be happy with this review because most of them live in an alternate universe where ANY comic (graphic novel) that makes it to TV is automatically an object of worship about which nothing unkind can be said.<br/><br/>But the pilot, the "origins" if you prefer, was way below what it should be.<br/><br/>Here is the thing. I grew up with the DC world, in real time (the 60s), I have seen every theatrical release of a comic hero ever done, and on this database I am (egad) a "top reviewer." So said, and acknowledging the decades-old battle between DC and Marvel for comic supremacy, I was happily surprised when DC endowed Arrow with rich quirky characterizations and great dialog, elevating it to fair competition for AGENTS OF SHIELD. (The latter has the Whedon brothers behind it, the real "superheroes" of TV writing) I had high expectations for FLASH and not one was met. When I see that tiny grimace on the face of Grant Gustin, I do not see a superhero trying to adjust to his powers, I see an actor trying to adjust to his character. Big difference.<br/><br/>The supporting roles in the pilot seem weakly drawn, and the pep talk from Stephen Amell should have come with a warning for diabetics.<br/><br/>Sure, this series will find its sealegs over time and the fanboys will forgive almost everything, but the fact remains, a weak start. I don't know how this show got a 8.3. the plot is so weak and many a times the show itself contradicts the character i.e. the flash. the story could have been way better if the writer put a bit of commonsense to it. it's utterly disappointing to see one of your fiction hero turn into a worthless couch potato. i couldn't get past a few episodes watching it. But the hope of getting it better made me watch like 12 episodes and to my disappointment i had to let go of a fictional superhero i liked. i hope they either improvise the show or stop it. so much of obvious fact is overlooked and so much of story is put such that to complete a episode. the viewer satisfaction, the most important part is plainly forgotten. it's more of a child's show who watch simply to watch and nothing else. The show is very childish. If it is only for kids than I guess I can praise the show. One thing irritated me throughout the show that the hero runs extremely fast and shows of his speed skills in many unnecessary ways. But when he is fighting against the villain he waits right in front of the villain to say the dialog and get his ass kicked. Flash saves people from burning building and flying car but can not take the villain to somewhere else through speed or cant even take the gun from his hand instead he waits to dodge the bullet. What type of absurd is that? Another thing I saw that there were some college kids as the most skillful researchers. No seriousness in acting only focus is on glamor. Crime happening and the flash group can see everything from their lab. The whole concept is lame than animation its just baseless. 1 and 2 they are ok. But after that its getting worse. And please get rid of iris. I'm sorry but a "genetic analysis" on an "digital file proved the file was genuine"!? What does genetic has to with digital files!? The flash his speed causes clothing to burn a shirt of an hot woman he rescued, forcing the flash to tear of the shirt of said (good looking) woman. In every other episode where the Flash rescues people their clothes DON'T catch on fire. I guess that the laws of physics only set your clothes on fire if you're good looking... and that's just some examples of the bad writing. The Flash COULD have been a very good series, if only if the writers would have been a little more grounded in reality. Too bad they are not. Bet let's be honest, if you are an writer for the script of The Flash, with no (real) understanding of physics AND having a habit of ignoring what kind of solutions you wrote to a problem in the last episode and decide to change it anyway, what kind of writer are you then? And (even worse) this is probably why you won't see the Grant Gustin (the actor playing the Flash in the series) playing the Flash in the movies like Superman vs Batman and other yet to come. Im only continuing to watch because I'm the type of person who has to finish what they start. And honestly, Cisco makes that show. Yes there are plot holes in the story. Blah blah.... <br/><br/>The real reason for this bad review is Iris. She is so ANNOYING!!!!!!!! <br/><br/>"Omg I cant let my boyfriend have a secret." "I have a villain in the back of my car but I cant drive off when stopped cause I'm such a good person so I'm gonna let him go." "I don't love Barry, but I love Barry."<br/><br/>I cant stand her. Every episode I watch, I keep hoping that she'll just die already. ugh. Honestly this show started a little slow, first episode was OK and then it went a little monotonous, then the storyline became more evident and the twists are great! As it's coming closer to the end of the first season i'm getting closer to the edge of my seat and it's making me think! The cast didn't feel like they clicked but as it's going on they're connecting more and more, the only thing wrong is it takes a little time to grow on you and then it becomes fantastic! The Arrow makes guest appearances which I love! Please give it a try! I really don't want it to be cancelled like so many other shows with amazing potential! "To understand what i am going to tell you now, you have to do something first. You have to believe in impossible" - this is the first line we get to hear when we start watching the show. Well it's pretty simple. When we are talking about superheroes we have to believe impossible. I read some reviews where people are telling that it's a dumb show because some things are unbelievable and unrealistic. well, hello guys ! isn't everything about superheroes are kinda unrealistic ? The flash was one of the few shows where i get to see some amazing and cool application of science. Starting from the particle accelerator to everything that sisco makes. They are not actually unrealistic. We never know in future those stuffs may actually happen. No, I am not talking about the meta-humans. I am talking about the cool scientific stuffs.<br/><br/>Watching the show the young generation will get inspired about science. The work of Programming, Mechanical engineering and the cool scientific machines are really cool.<br/><br/>Not only about science but the storyline, the suspense, the twists and turns which is shown in every episodes is simply awesome. If anyone out there is a superhero fan, you will love this series. I love superheroes and I'm a fan of the Flash, and this does the character justice. Comparisons can be made between this and the 1990 series, and, sure enough, people from the former show (John Wesley Shipp-the Flash in that show-, Amanda Pays, Mark Hamill, etc.) make appearances in this show. This starts with how he gets his powers (with a nod to Green Lantern, his friend from the Super Friends!) and goes from there.<br/><br/>I like the characters, special effects, and the enemies, along with the episodes' stories. I loved the one with the "Reverse Flash" and the visits to his father in prison. Try watching this along with the 1990 version and see which one you like better. It might be a tough choice! *** out of **** "He who runs fast will always be ahead of the slow, at least in terms of the distance they have travelled in a race."<br/><br/>This show makes me feel great about life in general. It is in actuality an accurate depiction of my life. My entire childhood I have been fat but then one day after watching this show I got the motivation to run like my pants were on fire. Since then I have never stopped running and better than that I have fallen in love; both with this show and it's lead. This is the kind of show you want to watch if you want to learn something in life. The best thing about the show is the lighting. I like that it is mostly day time in the show and that we are able to see the faces of the people of the planet so clearly. It gives me much joy to be doing this. Another good aspect of the show is the way it coalesces fantasy and science and creates this cool new world with colour and fantasy and goodness. More shows should strive to be like this phenomenal work of cinema. My only request from the makers of the show is that they cancel the show. It was when i reached season 1 episode 15 when i gave up on this show. Yes the special effects are good and other aspects of this TV show are good but this show is also bad in some ways. first of all its kind of always the same thing. the flash learns of another medahuman or a criminal. flash fights medahuman/criminal and fails. The flash finds another way of fighting the criminal/medahuman and this time beats him and they trap the medahuman in S.T.A.R labs and at the end sometimes we get another secret on Harrison wells. Also i feel like the flash could be way better if it wasn't so childish. Thats the reason why I prefer Arrow and Gotham to this. They are dark and gritty at times and they are not targeting for very young audiences. Also the action sequences in the flash and the special effects(even if most of the time the special effects are good) are REALLY LIKE REALLY BADLY DONE.Like seriously.I don't know if its the same for season 2 but thats what i think of the flash. I give it three stars for three reasons<br/><br/>-great audio quality -great picture (when they aren't throwing c.g. speedsters everywhere) -they are very faithful to the graphic novels<br/><br/>But i HATE everything else about this show. There has been some praise for various aspects of the show, such as the fact that Barry is not dark and brooding but upbeat and cheery despite his tragic past. Two things, this doesn't change the fact that the show is terrible, and this really isn't as much a good decision on behalf of the show creators, but just a faithful adaptation of barry allen as portrayed in the comics.<br/><br/>The show has also been praised for things like having a hero that is skinny and smart rather than muscular and tough. It's being praised for promoting a good body image for young men that are slender. Fine, but it doesn't change the fact that the show is awful.<br/><br/>I'm not prepared to say that the actors are terrible. I maintain that even the best of actors cannot survive bad writing and direction. I am much more inclined to blame the terrible writing than the acting.<br/><br/>I am myself a physics student so all of the science in this show is far more cringe worthy for me than it is for many people but i have to insist that if you are going to try to give scientific explanations for something, you MUST consult with an actual scientist. They clearly did not consult even a freshman physics student, or even a mildly well informed layman, let alone a professional. Nonetheless, i am biased when it comes to the science so won't go into it.<br/><br/>I can't eloquently detail all of the problems i have with the show, so i'll just bullet point the ones that come to my head.<br/><br/>-inconsistent powers<br/><br/>-dragon ball z style formula (try all your moves, fail, get ass kicked, learn new move, beat bad guy)<br/><br/>-iris is the F***ING WORST! there are characters that are designed for you to hate (Joffrey from GoT) and i love that they are there because i'm supposed to hate them and i do. iris, on the other hand, i am supposed to like her and root for her and berry to get together. I don't, she is the worst.<br/><br/>-good actors are given nothing to work with. Tom Cavanagh is easily the best part of the show, though still not not good. again, this is due to the terrible writing and direction.<br/><br/>-Repetitive<br/><br/>-full of plot holes<br/><br/>-I won't say that it "doesn't make sense," because it's super easy to understand, it's just that it's dumb. Sorry, i don't have a better way to say it, it's just dumb.<br/><br/>I have other stuff to do so i'm going to stop now, but this show seriously sucks. You've read the comics. You've seen the cheesy 1990 version. Now brace yourself, for the best comic book adaptation of a founding member of the Justice League you will ever see on television.<br/><br/>Meet Barry Allen, a nerd-linger who's always late to everything and has more anxiety than a teenage girl during a class presentation. He appears to be a normal nerdy dork who works in a forensics lab (naturally) His life began with tragedy when his mother was murdered by someone or something when he was just a child, the cops being the predictable idiots that they are decided to arrest his father. Now he's all grown up and actively trying to find his mothers killer, to exonerate his dad.<br/><br/>He is suddenly hit by a bolt of lightening transforming him into the impossible.<br/><br/>Now watch this ex glee geek Super Speedster fight crime, by running, running faster, and then running even faster than that.<br/><br/>Brought to you by the good writers who left Arrow (leaving it in the hands of a teenage fan girl in the body of a 40 year old) but then consequentially it's on the CW so expect teenage ANGST! and love triangles, and a love interest who leads him on but also has feelings for some other poor sod.<br/><br/>Expect sparks, literally while he runs around Central City catching criminals with the help of his sidekicks and the mysterious (and amazing) Dr Harrison Wells.<br/><br/>With just the right amount of humour, drama and action you won't be disappointed with this newest addition to DC's TV universe. After a "nuclear accident" of some sort, Barry Allen a young man who works as a CSI assistant for the police, gains superhuman abilities and he can run, think and react impossibly quick, plus his body can regenerate extremely fast after an injury.<br/><br/>The main problem arises from the fact that he is not alone! Other people, without the good intentions and heart of Barry, were also affected by this accident and gained some different but impressive nevertheless abilities.<br/><br/>The premise is similar somehow with another young superhero series: Smallville, where the meteor that carried Kal-El from Krypton, gave to many supervillains their superpowers.<br/><br/>The good about "The Flash" though is its somehow lighthearted tone. Despite a tragic mysterious event that marked the life of a young Barry Allen, the series tries to be less dark than its cousins "Arrow" and "Gotham".<br/><br/>The main actor Grant Gustin also helps with that. He has that enthusiasm of a kid on a roller-coaster every time he becomes "The Flash".<br/><br/>In every episode (I only saw the first 2) seems that the Flash will fight a different supervillain, but there is also a mystery a backbone story that you will get a hint of it, in the end of the pilot (and the 2nd ep. too).<br/><br/>The visuals are good in general. It would be a bad move to even begin such a series without a good fx team. The supporting cast is also good enough and you get the "old Flash" John Wesley Shipp as Barry Allen's father.<br/><br/>Overall: Seems like a good series for its kind. Lighter than others but still with the dramas and emotions that you usually expect from the genre. 1st off this version of the Flash is way too young. Very unlike the original DC comic.<br/><br/>2nd Iris Allen is black. Why change history? Who are you trying to appeal to? What's next in line for changes? Make Batman and Robin gay and Wonder Woman and Lois Lane lesbians just to appease the growing numbers of homosexuals today.<br/><br/>If you can't keep the TV series original, then you will lose your fan base and most probably the entire TV show. There are many people who would to see the original characters and story lines from the original comic books. I watched only the first episode. I wanted to like the show but I got the sense that the whole show is going to be very formulaic and melodramatic. <br/><br/>There seems to be a connection between this show and Arrow, which has has similar limitations of being formulaic, even though I enjoyed watching the first season of Arrow. <br/><br/>Some of the ideas behind The Flash are interesting -- lots of interesting physics, for example -- but the show itself is pretty awful. Again, this is my assessment after watching only the first episode. I usually give a show two to three episodes before deciding whether to keep watching or not, but, as much as I wanted to like the show, I found it to be a bit painful to watch because of how formulaic it was. My 12 year old son and me watched the first part of this series tonight on cable. Normally I am not a fan of this genre but every minute was a pleasure to discover. This was amazing with a good introduction in to the story. It is the same formula as in the Batman movies. Not too complicate and easy to follow. And it worked here too as many reviews on this site confirm. There are lots of plots and twists and I was never bored. There is a good mix of suspense and research material about his power mysteries from Flash. The director did a solid job and even if some scenes could have been stolen from other marvel comics. Anyway, I had an entertaining time and I am already curious to see part two next week when Flash comes back again on TV. Even my son gives a flash rating of 10/10. In this episode, the speed of Flash would have easily solved any problem presented by the villains. Instead the writers went with a totally illogical story line, creating a 'threat' that could not exist if Flash is as fast as portrayed in previous episodes. The acting was fine and there was no default in directing, CGI, production or editing. This one is truly on the writers.<br/><br/>Science Fiction can only exist to the point that one can suspend disbelief enough that everything fits and is true to the story and characters. It may be total nonsense but like the transporter on Star Trek, a viewer is able to suspend disbelief enough to just enjoy the show. This one violated that rule. I was not able to suspend disbelief based on the rules already established in earlier episodes. I really wanted to like this latest attempt to portray DC Comics' "The Flash" character on the small screen. I grew up in the early 70's reading all the Barry Allen character's comics and he was my favourite of all the super heroes going around at the time. I also enjoy the show's progenitor "Arrow", itself based on another DC character, but like with the Oliver Queen character, the story here is changed to suit the demands of today's American TV audience.<br/><br/>To be honest though, there never was much depth in the original comics anyway, Barry Allen was a blond, crew-cut 9-5, police scientist regular guy with a reporter girl friend (later his wife) Iris West, who fought a Rogues Gallery of costumed villains with his super-speed and super-vibratory powers. Here Iris West is changed into a young black girl and her absent-minded professor father in the comics to a right-on detective colleague of young Barry's who's got his back. Shades of Oliver Queen's troubled love-life from "Arrow" and of course there are parental issues too with the imprisonment of Barry's father for killing his mother likely to be the "Fugitive"-type running plot throughout the series. There's also a back-up team to assist our hero, again just like in "Arrow". <br/><br/>To be fair I've only seen the first episode but I think I know what I'm in for, namely, flashy (no pun intended), special effects and shallow characterisation. The young actor playing Barry Allen seems too callow for the part. The SFX are mixed, the blurring as Flash whizzes around town is fine but the close-ups of him on the run make him seem static. I like the costume as it doesn't deviate too much from the original and I liked the discreet nods to the DC universe with references to Grodd the super-ape and Ferris Airlines (Carol Ferris is Green Lantern's girl-friend in the comics), plus of course there's a mutual admiration hook-up with Stephen Amell's Arrow thrown in for good measure.<br/><br/>My hope would be that they play up the super-villains aspect of the comics as well as developing Flash's powers beyond just running around fast all the time. I don't think I'll get it somehow as our boy gets sucked into a tug-of-war for Iris's affections and a drawn-out plot to free his dad. <br/><br/>I'll keep watching though, I owe it to my teenage-self. Today I was going to end my life......... Just before I was going to put myself down for the long sleep something told me to quickly jump on to IMDb and check the rating for 'The Flash' to my utter horror and disbelief the people had given it a rating of 8.3. It was then when I found my calling, the world needed me, my life had turned around, I must live for the greater good, the people need the truth and I was gonna be that hero who was gonna make the stand I was to become.......... In all seriousness what I just wrote is more interesting then what I've seen of 'the flash' once again a hero was turned into a kids show. As a graphic novel fan I feel that flash has become another victim of teenage crap, hero shows need to be made for adult audiences not for children and there 'the worlds a perfect place' outlook. I gave it a little better rating as the cgi effects of the flash are well put together. I personally wouldn't put time into this, try 'Dardevil' instead BEWARE SPOILERS AHEAD i give it a 2 out of 10 because the first season overall story was somewhat appealing, barry training and becoming a hero while dealing with his personal life and how all the other characters fit into it was entertaining.<br/><br/>having said this show that's somehow regarded with generally good reviews fails at so many things, the increasingly cheesy writing, the inconsistency with its own established rules which most of the time make no sense anyway like bursting clothes into flames once he stops running(this is why he needed a suit right? well it doesn't seem to be an issue after episode 1 hes constantly seen running with regular clothes and they never catch on fire)<br/><br/>the fact that the show treats its audience like morons thinking they can get away with making a guy stop a bullet the moment it touches his skin from being unable to take down most villains who shouldn't even stand their own against him for even 1 tenth of a second the show starts with a flat out lie <br/><br/>I AM THE FASTEST MAN ALIVE (EXCEPT WHEN IM NOT...WHICH IS ALL THE TIME)<br/><br/>the acting was promising and the clichéd superhero characters were surprisingly entertaining but after season 1 it all seems the same no subtle character development at all, dumb end of the episode out spoken life lessons and the acting is just always the same no real change except for tom cavanagh(obviously) the rest just stay the same<br/><br/>the never ending hopeful hero, the will they wont they routine with the love interest, the nerdy sidekick, the best dad in the world idiocy, the young hot female doctor who's got an answer for everything<br/><br/>at the end of the day this show wont make you remember a great scene, plot, dialogue, dramatic moment or action thrilling sequence...it wont make you laugh nor cry you wont be happy when they finally beat the villain the episode will end and nothing noteworthy will have happened at all, might as well go to the park and feed pigeons I picked up this show, because it had a high rating. But I struggle to find any saving graces for this show. I mean the acting is poor, the writing is poor and the entire show is one big cliché.<br/><br/>Besides that the show is also missing in depth.<br/><br/>This show is predictable and the sci-fi is over the top. Here's an idea why don't you just use magic instead. Instead of using X particle or quantum physics for the sake of convenience.<br/><br/>The people I would recommend this show to: 12-13 year old children.<br/><br/>Some other people that would enjoy this show would be people that enjoy every other superhero movie. I am not saying there aren't any superhero movie/series good ones, but it's a rarity these days. I love all DC characters. 'Arrow' is now my favorite TV adaptations. 'The Flash' has good stories and good actors. Nonetheless, the special effects are so-so and the Flash's outfit is downright disappointing. The cowl is passable except for the lightning ear-pieces as the lightning design has been already overused all over. The original 'wings' ear-pieces would be much more pleasing to the eye. From neck down, the outfit goes from bad to worse. It is flabby, in the wrong color, with an enormous non-aerodynamic belt buckle and a horrible pair of boots. The costume designer should go back to the silver-age flash uniform designed by Carmine Infantino. (SORRY FOR MAKING THIS LONG) So for the record, I have no particular bias for the Flash character when I started this show. I've never read any of the comics, but I have seen a few episodes of the Justice League Animated series, but I never really saw anything that made me particularly attached. So I was surprised when I started this show!!<br/><br/>The show, for the most part, is actually pretty entertaining. It's first few episodes start out kinda rough. Dialogue is cheesy, some of the special effects could be amazing here but garbage there. So I'm going to go in depth with the pros and address people's complaints of the show.<br/><br/>Pros: The show, for the most part, like I said before is rather entertaining. It provides it steady amounts of twist and turns. The actors' performances were solid and they all had relatively well chemistry with each other, making scenes funny when they needed to be, or sad, serious, or strong, they managed to portray it. The special effects were really good for a television show, (even though the first 5 or 6 episodes the special effects look pretty sketchy, like how close ups of the flash running in slow-motion make him look fake and rubbery, like running from the wave after dropping of Plastique in the ocean or when he did his first Supersonic Punch on Gurder.) the music was good, and the season long plot was good to follow. <br/><br/>Whats bothering me the most right now is how dense people are, and how they find practically stupid things to complain about. Like "OH MY GOD THIS SHOW IS NOT A GOOD REPRESENTATION OF THE CHARACTER, HIS HAIR IN THE COMICS IS BLONDE, NOT BROWN, SCREW THIS SHOW!!" Please just get your butthurt self out of here. A character is not defined by his hair color. Another issue people seem to complain about is the flash is too young, being 26 years old, while in the comics he doesn't become the Flash until he's in his 30s. Well they explain this in the plot of why they made him younger. *SPOILERS* In the plot, the Barry Allen we know in the comics is currently in the future. In a fight between the Flash and the Reverse-Flash, they travel back in time to the night that Barry Allen's mom Nora was murdered. The Flash fails in saving his mother, instead saving his younger self. After the Reverse-Flash kills Nora and tries to return to the future, he realizes that his Speed is gone. Reverse-Flash (Eobard Thawn) realizes the only way to get back is to create the Flash. In the Reverse-Flash's timeline of the future, the Particle Accelerator that gave the Flash his powers is said by Thawne to be created in 2020. But Thawne kills the original creator of the Accelerator and builds it himself in the year 2014 so that he can make the Flash sooner. WHICH MAKES THE FLASH'S AGE MAKE SENSE. In the original timeline he did become the flash at the age of 32, but in the timeline that this story takes place in, he's 26, so thats out the window.<br/><br/>Other complaints people have is that the plots are boring, writing is dumb and the writers assume they're morons. Guys...this is a superhero show aimed at both kids and adults based on a comic book, what would you expect? There is no way you're going to get the next Batman Begins (which isn't meant for kids) or a Oscar for best Drama. It's just a show thats meant to have fun and not be taken seriously. It's definitely the best superhero show on the air right now. The arrow is the 2nd best, still entertaining, but not as fun as the flash.<br/><br/>Anyways, this show is still a massively fun ride! The writers know exactly who the character is, and they don't care what other people think, they're having massive fun with the character and doing it to the best they can. This is a great show and I would definitely recommend it. I actually watched The Flash before Arrow, I thought it would confuse me or something but it didn't actually. Overall I just finished the season and I am really impressed! Everyone here is complaining about the acting or the script but that isn't really true to my opinion. <br/><br/>Spoilers: A few points did bother me and that is that Caithlin talks a bit too much about Ronnie in the episodes before the found out Ronnie was alive. I mean, has she been talking about him that much for the past 9 months? An other thing is that Iris kind of complains to much and it becomes kind of whining about every bad thing. I mean in the episode Flash vs Arrow, she immediately doesn't trust The Flash anymore although he explained everything to her. I hope they give her more of an add to the show now that she knows Barry is the flash. And I think they should have let the viewers know that Dr. Wells is the reverse flash just a little bit later. <br/><br/>But those are just a few points that don't really matter that much. I love the plots and I really have fallen in love with some characters. Cisko! I just love him, he is awesome. I think it is one of the best shows I have ever seen. I agree with the comment "Caitlin is likable and seems a better fit for Barry, the same could be said for Iris and Ronny". No chemistry between Barry and Iris. The actress playing Iris looks so much older than Barry. They don't look good together !!! Better build romance between Barry and Caitlin. I thought that episode when Barry kissed Caitlin - was a start of their romance. Just let Iris marry her current boyfriend or better yet kill her character in the show.<br/><br/>Its so sad to watch a show that main character's romance is BAD. I might stop watching the show unless they fix the show's romance --- WE don't like IRIS !!! Last Fall Began The Newest Addition to CW Superhero Lineup to The Flash which Stars Grant Gustin(Glee) as Barry Allen/The Flash, Candice Patton(The Guest) as Iris West, Danielle Panabaker(Sky High) as Dr.Caitlin Snow, Rick Cosnett(The Bet) as Eddie Thawne,Carlos Valdes as Cisco Ramon, Tom Cavanaugh(Ed) as Dr.Harrison Wells/Eobard Thawne Jesse L.

But as the show progressed and when the main villain was presented, it only got better. One aspect that makes it more interesting is the shared universe with other super heroes TV shows, creating such enormous possibilities.<br/><br/>The light tone of the TV series and funny moments contribute enough for The Flash differentiate from other series that have a darker tone. In us develop a kind of sympathy with the characters, as the synergy and the connection grows between the characters along the episodes. In the end, The Flash shows how to make a TV series, despite being extensive, with a good story, with a good cast and in which you feel pleasure to watch it. This show has so many plot holes and bad logic that you just can't look past it anymore. The flash can catch a bullet no problem but he still manages to get punched every episode. And that's just a needle is a gigantic haystack of dumb stuff going on in this show. This show has the same terrible cw formula as all the cw shows do
1. Continuity the continuity is basically none existing example in season 2 Barry realizes that going back in time to save his mother is a bad idea in 3 season all that is thrown out the window
2. The dialogue is basically the mcu dialogue only
it's even more cringe with less character development
3. Repetitiveness in 98% of the episodes are all the same let me break it down the main plot barry realizes that he can't stop the villain and so one of the team flash members gives a speech and barry is automatically convinced sub plot one of the members of team flash are angry or sad and another team flash member catches on and says they'll talk to them and they change their mind
4.theirs too many episodes which leads to time-wasting episodes
The only way I can see this show being good is to reboot it on the DC universe streaming service and get the people who write doom patrol to write the flash they'll have a bigger budget so the cgi won't look like a fan film What in the world made the writer come up with the character of iris? noone with brains in this world and in this universe would live with a girl like her. not even in the movies. Not even in other earths..
The show is really good without her.
Send her on vacation on earth 2.. Could the writers please just break Barry and Iris's relationship? Or better yet just remove her from the series. Love the actors! Nearly HALF the couples on the show are gay?? Done watching. Writers try to make abnormal relationships normal. Like the title says because this show has gone downhill !! The only episodes that are good right now are either written by Todd Helbing or Sam Chalsen ( season 5 ) Several friends and family members seem relatively addicted to this show and as hard as I try, I can't rustle any interest beyond complacent curiosity. Having been force fed the series in binge style, I found myself reading the news or fiddling around on my phone more than actually paying attention. Can someone please explain the attraction to this show to me? I'm honestly trying to find something that I don't consider insulting to writers, actors, producers, etc., of true quality shows. Plot lines I have seen require far more than simple suspension of looking at the world as it is and instead demands more of a childlike absence of understanding those same principles. However, although I am not honestly entitled to label myself as the most mature person in any small group, I believe I am too old for whatever this supposedly represents. I have no problem accepting the show as a live-action cartoon, but that belongs to an entirely different and significantly younger demographic/generation. What I can say positively is how impressed I am with actors, as unconvincing as they are, who can stand in front of a camera and deliver such contrived and wince-inducing dialogue.<br/><br/>Additionally, special effects often come across as worse than B movie throw-aways and I feel an empathetic tug of regret for those involved. <br/><br/>I don't want to deride it any more because I am holding out hope that someone, anyone, can show me how to appreciate this offense to spending quality time with my family.<br/><br/>As the title of my post says, I'm confused and asking for help. Please? I'm only on the third episode but man am I hooked! The effects are really on par for a series, especially one as effects heavy as this. I was really expecting some lame speed effects like in Smallville (which got better with age and budget), but they are really cool, especially in the First episode.<br/><br/>I will say that when I say similar to Smallville, I mean as in the premise of the first season or so. Like monster of the week Buffy style.<br/><br/>A massive shock wave of... erm stuff...(I forget) has affected the whole city like in Smallville how everyone and their dog (literally there is a super dog in that series) got affected by meteor rocks... or what you kids would call... "kryptonite". You kids with your touch screens and your hashtags... <br/><br/>I'm getting off topic, it's cool, watch it. Not groundbreaking, but fun. This wasn't a necessary spin off. This series could have been handled as recurring characters on 'Arrow'. The speeded up running around is monotonous. The cast looks like supporting cast. Grant Gustin is dorkishly charming but not leading man material. Candice Patton and him have no chemistry. Danielle Pannabaker looks a bit bored. This show lacks the A list (for TV) quality cast that 'Arrow' has. After a month it's just kind of lame more so than 'the Tomorrow People' which was canceled. The clear his father thing is so clichéd. Don't know why it's attracting such large viewer numbers. Can't see it lasting to a second season. I've only seen one episode and it was good. The criticism is that it is not True Detective or The Wire. Well you are comparing premium cable's filet Mignon' to the WB's ground chuck. That standard disqualifies all other television as being anything other than trash because those are the high water mark for TV. This show does not aim to be poignant or transcendent. It's based on a comic book. It's supposed to give you some interesting villains, some cheap thrills and good special effects. You're here for some easy exciting escapism maybe while you're studying or doing something else. It accomplished this for me. The acting wasn't bad, the lead I would actually grade above average. The appeal of comic book super heroes is the classic and obvious battle of good vs evil. I like that they aren't trying to do too much. It wasn't awkwardly reaching for something profound. The comic book was not The Walking Dead. It was a clean cut hero story and this is what you are getting. After watching the season Flash i have came to a conclusion. That the writer of the show was in a hurry and tried to sum up the episodes and give a story with too many glitches and flaws.<br/><br/>It looks like the characters are really stupid and dumb in one episode flash saves a man and then stop by asking him if he was fine and whereas there's a women just about to get blown in a car.<br/><br/>In season 2 when zoom is beating flash Cisco shot him with one bullet of Dr. Wells serum after getting shot zoom stays there for 3- 5 seconds moaning with pain and taking out the bullet mean while Cisco could shoot him twice or may be thrice and they could have lock him up.but then where was the fun in that writers wanted to drag the show. <br/><br/>And i think the casting director of the show didn't look up for any other heroine for the show and they cast Candice Patton who is ugly as hell, no i am not being racist over here because there are many other black girls who are damn pretty like Kat Graham. Every guy in this show is hitting on IRIS WEST. flash loves her, Joe's partner Eddie who is really a handsome guy loves her and even that steel villain also liked her. Why, why someone who is not even close to pretty gets all the attention whereas Flash who can get any girl fall for her even after dating Linda park, and that new partner of Joe's he still have feelings for her. <br/><br/>Please someone just get iris west off the show as this show is weak in many aspects but at least replacing Candice with some one prettier will raise up the glamour portion of the show. This show started out great in Season 1 and Season 2 until it became Team Iris instead of The Flash. They do the most ridiculous things that do not make sense. It feels like Im watching a silly cartoon for kids. I do not recommend this show. It starts great then becomes so cheesy! Same as Super girl, Arrow and LOT. They are all stupid now. Only meant for kids. I will stick to mature Marvel TV shows. If you complain about Iris on their FB page they will block you. How cool is that controlling what your viewers say. So I rate this a 1. I would have given it a 0/10 I love this show already, This maybe either a spoiler alert of a tease alert.I found it very interesting that there is a possibility that batman will make some type of appearance or they are just seeing who really is paying attention. The end of the first episode of The Flash it showed Doc Wells stand up and look at a newspaper which title the Flash had vanished. Now if you look close and pause it on the part you will notice that is also says Wayne tech and Queen Inc. merger complete!!! So we will see what happen in the future.very smart to add that in there. I really hope it happens all though I did read DC's potentially released movies that they hope to have out. We will see what happens. They should stick with who is currently playing arrow and flash now if they were smart. I love this programme, and won't give up on it, even though some of it seems abit daft. One of the best shows out there. I'm gonna fight 'em off A seven nation army couldn't hold me back They're gonna rip it off Taking their time right behind my back And I'm talking' to myself at night Because I can't forget Back and forth through my mind Behind a cigarette<br/><br/>And the message comin' from my eyes says, "Leave it alone."<br/><br/>Don't wanna hear about it Every single one's got a story to tell Everyone knows about it From the Queen of England to the hounds of hell And if I catch it comin' back my way I'm gonna serve it to you And that ain't what you want to hear But that's what I'll do<br/><br/>And the feeling coming from my bones says, "Find a home."<br/><br/>I'm going to Wichita Far from this opera for evermore I'm gonna work the straw Make the sweat drip out of every pore And I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding Right before the lord All the words are gonna bleed from me And I will think no more I know most of you are bored by this show and you don't like it anymore. I mean you are right it's too much drama but the crew puts a lot of effort in it and you should pay some respect for the good work they are doing! In my opinion this show is the best . I mean i love superheroes , who doesn't? I know there's been a lot of drama lately but i am looking forward to season7 and i can't wait for it!
Thank you for your understandig! Peace out! :)) This show is such a big part of me. I know that sounds like a lot, but I started watching it when it first came out, and I think it had a big impact on who I am today. Although it can get cheesy, it is still one of my favorite shows, and the first one I watched out of the Arrowverse. Positives: 1. FF (in this case 2FF). Negatives: 1. Really repetitively cheap CGI throughout such as the electric fire that represents our running (is he running?) Flash. 2. Typical TV series cheap domination of close camera panning of simply just "talking heads". 90+% of this Flash movie time is occupied by banter back and forth. No need for bodies - just amputate that useless commodity and save loads of money for the producers. Actors chosen for "eye candy" appeal for audiences satisfied with only that as their acting attribute. 3. Talking (part two) continued: Dialogue made to maximize audience size by keeping sentences short; words small. No harder than a high school sophomore reading level. 4. NO! He's not the fastest man (even in make believe). Usain Bolt would disagree. 5. Brief lab scenes, and shots of computer monitors. Sorry, not close to being a real lab setting and the monitors main purpose is to show pretty colored graphics that mean nothing. With all that money the producers could at least try - it would also be educational. 6. Borrowed (stolen) bad characters from other films (e.g. Avengers). A Sharknado; a Hulk type; a Kantmiss (Katniss) arrow slinger type; Horus staff (both human & blue flame thrower stick); Joker type; winged humans (a must in Satanic themed movies); King Kong type;. Conclusion: So much for creative writing. 7. Also borrowed and showing a basic middle school lack of paying attention in science classes are the representations of time travel; singularities; wormholes; parallel Universes (Earths too). The substance and thought behind those concepts came down to the writers just had people say those words with a few cheap effects added and used repeatedly. When I heard Barry was getting his own show, I thought it would be just another superhero show and that it wouldn't have the down to earth feel of Arrow. I could not have been more wrong. So far, Flash has managed to take the best elements of Arrow and add the ones it didn't have.<br/><br/>Everything about this show is amazing. Everything. The generic writing, the overall plots, the characters – I love all of it. ESPECIALLY the characters. The main cast is lovable and believable, and the main villain of the first season is the most intriguing I think I've seen in any show ever.<br/><br/>I hope this show keeps going for a long time! I really gave this show a chance. I really did. It's in it's second season now. I waited to see if maybe it would stop being like Smallville. But no it was a failure like Smallville was.<br/><br/>In Smallville EVERY episode, of the first season at least, was Clark and the gang trying to take down someone who was affected by the kryptonite. I mean it was boring. One person had control of fire, one mind control, another something else. Since they were exposed to the kryptonite during the blast when baby clark/meteorite/ship touched down on earth.<br/><br/>It was boring, lazy writing. And The Flash is no different. In season 1 EVERY episode was about Barry and the gang fighting people that were effected by the kryptonite, whoops I mean the particle accelerator blast. It's the SAME thing. Really it is, check it out. One person controlled the wind, another could teleport, etc....<br/><br/>Not only that the season 1 finales were exactly the same. There was a tornado of some kind, and we had one hell of a cliffhanger. I don't know about you, but these kinds of cliffhangers are very mean. It's better to wrap things up. When you leave things like this people forget what led up to it. If The Flash/Barry had fixed the singularity/tornado/whatever bs was going on, the next season would have been better set up.<br/><br/>Even in the Avengers movies they don't do that. It would be too cruel. Sure they set things up, but the movie goes back to homeostasis. Things clam down. Since NO ONE can keep track of THAT much (R@P. I HATED the season 1 finale of The Flash, but no I gave it a chance. And boy it let me down. Season 2 is full of 8u11$#!t. Are you serious!? Someone who comes from another world calls HIS home, "EARTH 2"!? Are you fu(&!ng kidding me!? It's too much 8u11$#!t...... <br/><br/>Also they are still doing a new person with superpowers each week, someone sent from Earth 2 now...ugh (light girl, shark man, etc.) All while ignoring actual plot. Like wasn't Barry and Iris meant to be? Then why is he dating the cop girl? Huh? Can't Barry go so fast that he can turn time back? Then why is he constantly being told he can't go fast enough? Whoops no time for this show to make sense or for plot development we gotta fight the new meta-human of the week!!!! Ugh.....<br/><br/>Unfortunately this show will probably run for a long time. Smallville lasted 10 seasons. Simply because of the rabid fan base. EVEN the fans of the show remarked how Clark had NO chemistry with Lois in the show. But they kept watching. So if you have no standards and love the Flash no matter what boy is this the show for you! You will totally ignore how no one can tell that Clark, whoops I mean Barry is the blur, whoops I mean the streak. Even though it's blatantly obvious.... I saw the first episode of The Flash on the recommendation of my cousin.He said that this one is best TV series out there.As he make me see the first episode I was left amazed.I already Saw TV series like Arrow,Gotham Vampire diaries and many more but this one really impressed me.I just wanted to see the whole season.<br/><br/>As the season progressed its story became even more interesting.The cross over of Arrow and Flash was always the best.Episode 8 features Arrow with some nice twists.Episode 22 and 23 still being the best.<br/><br/>Acting was best from everyone especially Grant Gustin playing Barry Allen or the Flash.His charm makes the show even more lovely.<br/><br/>Overall the show is my favourite of all time and it has a lot to offer.Really see one episode and you will not be disappointed. The show is put out by the same folks that dish out "Arrow." This one is better suited for younger viewers -- simplistic characters and solid TV special effects.<br/><br/>One of the annoying features of "Arrow" is that the producers demanded a flashback (actually several flashbacks) in every episode with connections (often contrived) between the present-day action and the action of the past. <br/><br/>Now "The Flash" seems to be going the same route by having flashbacks to young Barry Allen and the events of his childhood.<br/><br/>News-FLASH to the producers: just because the show is entitled "The Flash" does not mean that you must put a flashback into every episode. Please use flashbacks sparingly and thoughtfully. Avoid the formula approach!<br/><br/>The show is good comic book fun now; but with a little more thought put into the scripts, the show will get even better. I expected it to be a usual superhero show, but it was definitely different. The acting was well done, and Grant Gustin's humour reminds me of Andrew Garfield in the amazing spiderman. The flashback part of his mother dying was touching and Flash's meeting with his dad made us realize how deep the characters are. I liked it that it was not dark as dark and gritty is getting a bit mainstream nowadays. The show needs to be different and if it's funny it will stay good in the long run. Out of Gotham, Arrow, and Flash, I prefer Flash the most right now. The cast is perfect for the story and the arrow appearance was good. Overall it was super-awesome! Atrocious leads, with an acting range of a brick. Composed of melodramatic 90210 Drama, CW has failed to incorporate DC comic universe into a small screen to its true identity.<br/><br/>Grant Gustin: By far the most inaccurate and unqualified lead to guide the DC's key franchise. There are not enough letter in the alphabet to describe the inadequate acting ability, that is of Grant's. Rating: 1 (AWFUL) <br/><br/>Not to take anything way from the producers, however much focus has been set on the relationship drama than the opposing threat. After each episode, more questions are raised than answered. Plot holes so big, even flash cannot escape its gravitational pull.<br/><br/>I, especially am not a fan of team each CW heroes gets. Barry Allen, a genius cocky nerd, is set back by the CW's writing and is portrayed as a simpleton, a scientist with no knowledge on physics. Barry Allen prowess is his scientific mind. Without it, He is just guy who can run very fast. However due to his intellect and understanding of physics, He's able to do the impossible. Which the TV shows fails to convey. And is an absolute crime for treating a DC's key franchise in this manner, potentially lowering Flash's brand value. I am currently on the 6th episode and am trying to enjoy this show. So far the show is filled with humans with super powers who are all extremely evil except for the Flash. Every "meta human" is evil except for the Flash. It's just ludicrous.<br/><br/>The show is exactly like the Arrow-except wait-The Flash has no good characters in it. The humor makes me cringe and the dialogue makes me cringe more.<br/><br/>I am mostly watching this show out of boredom and I have to admit I must find out who murdered Barry's mom and what is going on with Harrison Wells (is he evil? what does he know? bla bla bla etc).<br/><br/>As for the people who claim this show is better than the Arrow you will have to fill me in on what I am missing, or maybe as I continue watching my opinions will change. Spoilers - for those who have never seen/read/heard any super-hero story. <br/><br/>In a metropolis, that is not named but look identical to New York city. <br/><br/>A little boy "LB" suffers a great tragedy. Becomes an orphan. The cop investigating the case, is father of a cute girl, who happens to be "LB"'s best friend. And lo and behold "LB" find a home. <br/><br/>He grows up to be a smart but wimpy man. Naturally he finds a nerdy CSI job. He is in love with his best friend, but cannot express his affection to her. He quietly suffer as she dates and fall in love with other men. <br/><br/>In the same city, a genius scientist commences his dream project, that quickly goes bad. The project collapses with a temporary jolt of energy that transform a small group of regular people, into super-humans. All but one of these super-humans goes the evil way. Big reward for guessing the identity of the sole super-hero. <br/><br/>The genius scientist helps "LB" realize his true power. "LB" decides to help denizens of his city and catch or kill the bad super- villains. <br/><br/>Big reward for guessing which good person turns out to be a big villain within 3 episodes. <br/><br/>Big reward for guessing if "LB" can express his love. <br/><br/>TL:DR - Watch it only if you have never seen any super-hero movie or TV show. <br/><br/>* Big reward - an AOL dial-up internet CD. Unlike other superhero TV shows that have aired in the past, The Flash is both true to the source material while keeping itself from getting too campy or ridiculous. This is a tough line to draw given that we're talking about a show where some of its characters have superpowers.<br/><br/>What I enjoy about Barry Allen's character is that he's a genuine force for good in the world. Yes, many people are so typically looking for a character that starts off jaded or corrupt and will progress through the show looking to find redemption. That's not what is happening here.<br/><br/>The Flash shows Barry as both a strong character in his maturity while remaining altruistic in his intent. He's smart in as the source material while also accessible with his emotional connection to his love interest (Iris).<br/><br/>I've enjoyed each episode and the constant nods to its DC comic source materials. The shows have been fantastic with the possible exception of a few details in the third episode (Things You Can't Outrun). As a show, I'm always finding myself looking forward to the next episode. Some of that might be the relentless hooks that they setup at the end of each one. The show stands well on its own while still interacting well with its sister show (Arrow) via some cross-over episodes.<br/><br/>I'm finding myself setting aside time so that I never miss the show. If you've watched the arrow you've seen this show - story, relationships, dialogue, the pretense of being a discourse in moral values while in truth being utterly superficial. It's the arrow with a geeky kid as the hero in place of the millionaire playboy.<br/><br/>It's another addition to the trend of making shows where story doesn't matter, characterization doesn't matter, just another show rigidly following what the networks perceive to be a successful formula. why look for creative writing when you can just churn entertainment out on a factory line.<br/><br/>Honestly, show's like this would be better if they didn't pretend to be something they're not - they wouldn't be good, but better. The preachiness is hilarious. I just watched the first episode and I must say that it really blew me. The effects and story were just WOW. <br/><br/>(I can't see this being a spoiler as anyone who has seen the trailer or the Arrow episode would know this). I loved how it tied with the Arrow. I hope they do a few more episodes where the two heroes work together. <br/><br/>I am not a massive DC fan but have read some of the comics in my time and followed all of the JLA episodes and DC animated movies and The Flash episode felt like what I remembered, it also links pretty well with The Flashpoint Paradox.<br/><br/>For anyone saying they showed all card... I don't think so, it was a great pilot and gave enough information so that viewers who are not familiar with the DC universe would understand what was happening. For anyone that want to know more go and read up on the Crisis stories, the Speed Force and some of the more notorious villains such as Doctor Zoom:) are you looking for some TV-show to watch and enjoy every episode of it??The Flash is your choice. till now I have not been disappointed from any episode , each one is just fascinating more than the previous one in an ascending order ,at the end of every episode you will always be excited to watching the next one , I Highly Recommend watching this series . The Flash is the best!!! in every way , the acting , the filming , every character plays his role perfectly ! as long as I keep talking about this series I will never talk enough , its an endless adventure/action/Sci-fiction TV show , one of the best every appeared on the TVs , there are too many scenes you will never predict to happen , you will always be surprised for what you are going to face. Guys every one should watch this TV-Show before Death~!! I mean it ! such a wonderful piece of ART!!!! The Flash is one of the best superheroes ever, as a kid I always regretted he had not enough pages on DC Comics: maybe his red costume or his simple superpower but there is something inspiring in him.<br/><br/>I just watched the first episode of the new TV series and I liked it very much: characters were cool (Harrison Wells' crew above all) and plot was catching. Special effects were OK too (car crushes were surprisingly good) and I know I'm hooked.<br/><br/>And oh, by the way, I know Sarah Connors is right: Internet will take the lead and we will have to fight for our lives against Terminators. But for the time being you can live anywhere in the world and watch American TV series. And that's cool too! I've reviewed "The Flash" many times over the years, ALL of which were removed. This series is so maliciously apathetic, I feel the need to keep taking my shots at it.<br/><br/>The Flash initially started as a pretty interesting new spin on a legendary DC Comic hero. Season 1 was watchable! Interesting enough, and the potential for so much more.<br/><br/>Season 2 started out decently, but "dropped the ball" doesn't even begin to accurately depict how infuriatingly terrible this show became. EVERYONE develops "powers" and EVERYONE has at least 3-4 lame monologues about the same juvenile bulls*** every single episode.<br/><br/>After losing the crutch that was Barry's Mom's death, the writing devolved into a meandering, convoluted after-school-special. TONS of social messages, ENDLESS unwarranted political perspectives, and MINIMAL enthralling television.<br/><br/>Around season 2 or 3, for SOME PC/SJW REASON, the show runners somehow got the impression that the audience liked IRIS and wanted to see infinitely more IRIS. Very bad call. She is the worst and further ruined an already terrible show. I imagine that's how hidden agendas work though. Actually, her entire existence demonstrates perfectly how willing The CW is to sacrifice a potentially decent show in the pursuit of whatever propaganda they're trying to peddle.<br/><br/>There is actually an episode in which Barry Allen, THE FLASH, somehow transfers his unattainable Meta-human abilities to his lame sister/girlfriend... and then offers that she keep them permanently because "We are the Flash".... I couldn't make this up if I tried. COMPLETELY GUTTED THE ENTIRE PREMISE OF THE SHOW.<br/><br/>The end of all of these garbage, agenda ridden shows is near AND IM ABSOLUTELY THRILLED.😏 The Flash was, for me, the saving grace in the arrowverse for a long time. When Arrow started to lack in the back half of seasons 3 and 4 and Legends of Tomorrow took themselves way too seriously, Flash seasons 1 and 2 picked up the slack with some great storytelling. Not only that, but it was genuinely a fun show to watch every week. I think the first two seasons balanced fun and comedy alongside the darker and sadder moments. Season 3 started off pretty strong, but quickly spiraled out of control in the finale. I also didn't like how dark the show became. The show became way too angsty. Many fans felt that way and the writers tried to rectify that with season 4, but pulled a Last Jedi. They made that season way too comedic and at times it was almost unwatchable. One extreme cannot be solved with another extreme. At this point, however, the rest of the arrowverse picked up the slack, particularly Arrow seasons 5 and 7. Season 5 of the flash does give me hope however. At this point I've watched the first 7 episodes and I think they've found the balance again. If the 100th episode sticks the landing, I think Flash can once again reclaim its throne as the best of the arrowverse. Flash used to be good show, first few seasons were good, it was fun, and it had so much to offer, it had potential to last for long time, but sadly it is got worse, both writting and acting was not like it used to be, and so it got harder and harder to watch it because.<br/><br/>They really forced some thing that I doubt many people love this direction unless they start watching show from season 4, if they skip first 3 season then sure maybe they will like this family-drama Iris centered show, I was hoping that this would be maybe 1 season only and some preparation for next but it continued and I just can't stand it anymore.<br/><br/>If you haven't watch show, I am mostly neutral, I like first few seasons but I hate so many episodes starting from season 4, in my opinion that is time where quality drops, and show direction was changed. Also if you read reviews you will probably find one thing in common with people who dislikes last seasons, "new" Iris is so hard to watch, family and Iris centered show almost every episode, I don't find it fun and it makes me sad because I used to love this show but now I need to fast forward scenes where Iris talks because I can't not even stand to hear her voice, similar to what happend with Arrow and Felicity.<br/><br/>I wish they never gave Iris shot-caller and main role in this show, she should have stayed on her old job, being here and there but mostly irelevent character that writes news, oh how I miss first few seasons. The build up in season 3 is good but the finale is a downer.
season 4 onwards its not worth it. about time dc follows the marvel way of doing this on TV! Great season one and a solid season two. Season three is the worst season at this time 08/29/18, it doesn't make any sense for the flash to try and hurt himself, there were many options, he could've went to another earth where there is no flash or no Barry Allen ETC. The ending of season three was probably the worst part, even though his back was facing Iris, there is no possible way for a bullet to catch up to the flash. They just wanted to build her character. Now the changing of Harrison Wells is repetitive, they have to keep making a new relationship with the same guy over and over. Season four also made little sense, great villain but Barry could've just punched out Devoe or just put him in the cells anything. They also focus to much on unnecessary relationships and force a lot thing in. Overall decent show hopefully they will improve and get it closer to season one and two.
I have to add some more I have thought some parts of season one made sense I enjoyed it
But after season two it's stupid I can't watch season 5 anymore it's so much to say I can't watch do not watch forget a 6 star 4 stars now wtf. The Flash is written amazingly and is full of action and entertainment. Not only will you get your dramatic climaxes with The Flash, but you will also get your not so serious funny moments. The Flash has a little bit of something for everybody, and even if you aren't a superhero fan, this show will make you one. There's a reason it's been the #1 show on The CW television network since it's debut in 2014. I love the humor and the chemistry between most of the characters. Barry's main love interest, Iris tho, I feel the chemistry is a bit forced. I really wish Tom Felton had been with the cast longer as he was a great addition.<br/><br/>The only thing I really find annoying are the cross over episodes when they affect the main story arc for the season and now with them crossing into both Arrow and Super Girl it's really hard to keep up if you don't watch all three shows regularly. It's fun when they are a complete side story, otherwise you have to track down all the episodes to get a coherent story. First three seasons was awesome,but in 4th season there is lack of action. The brightness, the energy, the characters, it's easy to watch.
Even though I do agree some episodes are hard to keep focus, they seem to correct it by the next one.
I also think it's hard to keep everyone focused in every episode when your working towards a big ending.
I love watching it The show is filled with action and emotion and is what every tv show should be. I originally loved the series. However, the past seasons have made it "too" unrealistic. Honestly the flash started off well then season two was okay but then season three was way too dramatic and it was all about iris dying. I was so sad that HR died instead of Iris, he was one of the best characters! season four is boring cause Cisco isn't funny anymore and Barry and Iris relationship is too perfect. ATM im only interested in Cecile and Joe drama and im exited for the crossovers cause i liked all of them! For me I couldn't get enough of the flash. I was watching it constantly but as time went on (season 3&4) my love for this show has begun fading. There is less and less action as the seasons go on. Less talk about quantum physics and time travel and more goofy childish things. Barry is running less and less. I fear that this show is becoming like the walking dead in a sense that it just gets so dry and has no action as time goes on. When The Flash aired during Arrow's third season, I personally enjoyed this lighter, funnier but emotionally more poignant CW superhero entry. The special effects looked great and the story was heartfelt. The Flash's true purpose was to build up the Arrowverse and bring some comic book nostalgia. Up until Season 2, it managed to execute flawlessly. Season 3, while still compelling, felt like a rehash of seasons past and not all the dialogue hit the right marks. Enter Season 4, probably the weakest season of the show to date. It's not terrible, but it lacks anything new or meaningful. Any interesting story arcs that are kicked are quickly shut down and this is true for Season 3 as well. The Flash is still a solid and good superhero show, but its losing consistency with every episode. Since the release of the trailer i have had high expectations for this series. Not only because Flash was my favorite among the Justice League but also because the special effects looked amazing.<br/><br/>However, this show is not even close to living up to my expectations. Here are the things I do not like about the series:<br/><br/>The script contains to many cliché dialogues. They make me cringe. Furthermore, Flash exhibits incredible speed all the time except when fighting villains. For example, in the episode, Going rogue, the villain is just a man with a freezing gun. Flash could easily decapitate him before he could even pull the trigger. However, he chooses not to and wait several seconds before trying to save other people. Most villains can be dealt with a gun. Usually Flash is not needed. The Flash was great fun the first 3 seasons but every season they add an unnecessary character and they become too annoying too quick! Nora, elongated man, killer frost with a good side! I mean cmon! Too much extra couples drama that nobody wants to watch! Get back to the basics with the first 3 seasons and get this show back on top again! This last season was trash. I fast-forward on almost every episode. Kaitlin as Frost, getting boring. There were no good storyline. Heck even the Big Crisis was a snooze. I thought after the Nora saga, things would have gotten better. And tired of that attorney lady having her "That's So Raven" moments lol. The Flash is one of my favorite comic book characters from my youth. He is smart but funny and thoroughly enjoys being a super hero and protecting his hometown that he loves. Sadly, this show understands none of that.<br/><br/>Every season this shows sets up a reason why The Flash (played by Grant Gustin who is great but hampered by poor dialogue and story lines) will not be super heroing that season (caught in the Speed Force, put in jail, dead, etc.) meanwhile they elevate every other character that you may, or may not, care about over the Flash. His team constantly lectures and pull down the Flash and in the latter seasons the comedy and fun has completely been sapped out.<br/><br/>My 13 year old son no longer wanted to watch the show anymore but I pushed on and tried another episode to give it one more chance. 22 minutes into the show the Flash hadn't donned his costume, nor had he stopped one crime. However, he was lectured by his wife (played by Candace Patton who I really like) about how she doesn't need him to save her and she had her own team, a staff for her magazine/website, and she is saving the city her own way. The next 10 minutes were focused on her and her team investigating crimes...zero Flash.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this is the Greg Berlanti (Arrow, the Flash, Supergirl, Batwoman, Legends of Tomorrow) playbook of super hero television, create an ensemble cast and dilute the actual hero the show is named for. For shows like Legends of Tomorrow that is fine but for shows like The Flash and Arrow you MUST focus on THE hero and their exploits. Also, let Flash be witty and funny like his character is supposed to be and one of the reasons he has been so popular over the years. Just a thought. I literally lived with this show ... I've watched it from the start since 2014, season after season. I REALLY loved it. Eventhough, it's been going down after S03 (which I consider the peak), til S05 it was still "The Flash" I knew. I just finished watching S06 and I am really disappointed. I think that whoever contributed in this season forgot how this show has been extremely outstanding. So many filler episodes ... so much drama ... talking .. talking .. talking. When has this show became just two people having a conversation. The dilemma wasn't that good ... even the super villain ... I've never been bored while watching this show. So when this happens in in 12/19 episodes in one season, I know that there's something wrong. It's like the only focus was on crisis which in my opinion was pretty great but could have been better. I'm not gonna lie and say that the show is over for me. i'm still gonna watch it just hoping that SEASON SIX WAS NOTHING BUT AN UNFORTUNATE MISTAKE! But what a mess, it's like watching the same story play out and replay out numerous times. The back and forth in the timeline becomes painful and a lot more far fetched than any super hero film all of which I love . Starting at season 1, this show used to be amazing, it had the right balance of drama, action and humour. The villains for the first two seasons were scary, thrilling and had meaning. The character arcs made sense, and worked for each character. But then, the show began to get worse and worse. New characters added, slowing down the story. Forgettable and laughable villains and a lot more. Throughout season 3,4 and 5 the show just slowed down to a halt. Until season 6. The first 8 episodes of this season were a master piece. All of Barry's fears were used against him, tensions were high, and the villain was the best since season 2. But then every episode since has just been plain stupid. There's too many characters, a terrible villain, an idiotic story and a lot more.
I will be watching the next season (7) but if that doesn't go well, this show might as well be over for me. Mwja?ðŸ˜¯ðŸ˜¯ðŸ˜«ðŸ˜°ðŸ˜«nzjzksksmmekshsjssmshsmsmejjee.eemseeeedvwftkeeienawmrrkehirnsjegesusjshejauejsjN?ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜«ðŸ˜°n?ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜«ðŸ˜°ðŸ˜«ðŸ˜¨ðŸ˜«n.ðŸ˜°ðŸ˜«n?ðŸ˜°ðŸ˜«ðŸ˜°ðŸ¤¢ðŸ˜¨ðŸ˜« Season 1 was amazing with a great story that kept you interested throughout the season with the reverse flash and a lot of character development.
Season 2 was good with an interesting story about zoom and time travel, however it had some boring and irrelevant episodes but as a whole it was good.
Season 3 was decent it had an interesting story about Barry being Savitar and Caitlin becoming killer frost. What I didn't like is what they did with flashpoint, they could have stretched the story out a bit longer because in the comics it's a big event. The last few episodes also felt rushed and they should have killed off Iris.
Season 4 is where everything started to go downhill they introduced a non speedster villain which I don't mind if it works but this didn't. They introduced annoying and irrelevant characters such as Ralph and Cecile. The only thing that kept me somewhat interested was to know who the mysterious girl were.
Season 5 in my opinion was better than season 4 but still far from great. I liked the daughter and father team up at first but as time passed Nora became extremely annoying and after her "secret" got revealed I wasn't interested in the cicada storyline. The reverse flash storyline came to late to keep me interested and it was quite obvious what he was planing too. Season 5 also had one of the worst episodes I've ever seen "girls night out", that was an embarrassing mess to say the least.
Season 6, is where things starts to get really really bad. The story is no longer about the flash, the story is primarly about a bunch of side stories that make no sense. This show is now about Iris and some boring side character that no one cares about. The majority of people watch or watched the flash to see the flash and his progress to become the Scarlett speedster we know and love.<br/><br/>I can't see this show coming back from this unless they go back and look what made the show good from the first place and I think the current writers are no suitable for the job. Seasons 1-3 were 9/10 4-5 6/10 then I just gave up watching Super recomendo assistirem a essa obra. I highly recommend watching this work. Scientific but childish it's can be better. And and seasons must be shorter and a little bit not be childish After being struck by lightning, Barry Allen wakes up from his coma to discover he's been given the power of super speed , becoming The Flash , fighting crime in Central City . The Flash is one of the best supernatural TV-show I've ever seen . In my opinion it is the best TV-show of the arrow-verse . I love all TV-shows with super powers and super heroes and The Flash is the perfect TV-show for that . The story is imaginative and is, in my opinion, one of DC ' s best . The special effects of super powers are so amazing !Grant Gustin , Candice Paston , Danielle Panabaker , Carlos Valdes and Tom Cavanagh make the action scenes even more intense . The costumes of every characters are extremely imaginative and funny . Tom Cavanagh and Carlos Valdes are incredibly funny and ads a lot to the comic side of the TV-show . The soundtrack and the music are so good ! If you like action and adventure TV-show with super hero and powers, you should watch The Flash . This is the TV-show to see . First 3 seasons were good, but season 4 was too funny and Disney like. There was too many jokes. Reverse Flash and the Zoom are my Favorite Characters .and the time travel concepts are very facinating in this series.after season 2 the best episode for me is what's past is prologue .at the season 5 The Flash in 2014 was my favorite series of all time and still is.But it has not improved since then.It actually got kind of worse.I rate Season one of the Flash 9 Stars,because every single episode is at least worth 8 and it goes up to 10.I would rate season two 8 Stars because the story was always about ZOOM,ZOOM,ZOOM.Every episode besides some were 7 or 8 stars to me.The ,,some" episodes were just amazing and reminded me of season one.Season 3... Season 3 was very good and very bad sometimes.Savitar was just not an exciting villain at all.Three speedsters in a row? Isn't that kinda boring? (Overall Rating:7) Anyways let's move on to season four.Season four started very well and reminded me of season one.Then it also gave us something new with the Thinker but then after a while I sadly had to realise that it was the same problem like Zoom that was bothering me.After the first few episodes it evolved to DE VOE,DE VOE,DE VOE.I rate season four 8 Stars because it went better than I excepted after Season 3.I hope that we'll get something new and refreshing with Nora in season five.Until season five starts in Germany Im gonna rate the show 8 stars,which is the only possible Rating it you calculate my season ratings. Season 1 of The Flash was awesome with everything needed in a Sci-fi superhero show - a good story with proper mix of action, mystery, drama, a likable lead and side characters and an awesome villain. This show was the reason I started watching Arrow.
Sadly the later seasons, don't match up despite the expanding on the concepts of time travel, the multiverse, and the annual crossovers with the other Arrowverse shows.
This show falls prey to the CW Arrowverse tropes way too much plus the problems of its own such as -
a. The characters keeping secrets and behaving like idiots just to create cheap drama.
b. Time travel is used way too much, thankfully season 4 has stopped this trend.
c. Barry's abilities are inconsistent just to create cheap drama and (maybe) due to budget problems.
So if you really want to enjoy this show just turn off your brain and go along as it doesn't always get better. Undoubtedly 'Flash' has got everything for a superhero series. However I think the Casting of 'Iris' as Candice Patton was pretty weird and disgusting role for this show, poor and irritating acting. Audiences hated 'Skyler White' Character as Anna Gunn in 'Breaking Bad' for the same reasons. I skipped all the scenes of 'Iris' while watching 'Flash'. I think Greg Gustin should kill this character for good to relieve audiences from this everlasting pain. The series had a rough first few episodes, but since Power Outage, it's been so good. It's a lot similar to Smallville with the bad-guy-of- the-week thing, but it's so much more fun. I didn't think I would, but I like this show more than Arrow and Gotham. Why? Because it's just pure fun. Besides the main plot, there are always subplots going on. Some more - and some less interesting, but it doesn't get boring. The show has a great sense of character based humor. And they even get the drama right! Sure, the love story is not as original as others that are on TV right now, but it's okay. Grant Gustin is amazing as Barry Allen, I'm excited to see more of this show. i am one of the millions of the fan OF COMIC book heroes....and Flash is one of my favorite one...i also wanted to have the TV series on flash and now finally its here.first of all for the cast i give CW 10/10.and i don't know why why people give THE FLASH 4 or 5 stars :( ..the show is cool...the acting is also very good...and one thing Barry Allen is so young other than like arrow and superman etc...and i hope it will continue like this for the newest 10 seasons..:)..and the series is more cool than the last flash movie came.. and i would like very much if the Barry Allens girlfriend should be Caitlin snow....:) and story to iris west. Just saw the pilot, let me say as a comic enthusiast I had no problems with GOTHAM, but with THE FLASHÂ… dear Lord. It starts really promising, I even disregard that Barry Allen is a blond guy, not a black hair guy, but hey is a TV version. Then they changed Iris too, it's OK, it's a TV versionÂ… but then they changed the HOLE origin of The Flash, right down to its core, he was raised by a cop who is Iris's Dad, Barry's dad is in jail for murdering Barry's mom, framed by Professor Zoom or The Anti-FlashÂ… So no more single mom, no more random act of murderÂ… it's no longer OKÂ… then they said that the lighting that hit Barry was caused by a particle accelerator explosion in StarLabsÂ… never mind the chemicals and the Speed ForceÂ… no everything is a messed up experiment. Basically they turned The Flash into ArrowÂ… that is so sad, I had high hopes for this one, but noÂ… thanks CW. Season 1 was great.<br/><br/>However, characters are cringy, annoying flash is incompetent, and he always needs people to be yelling in his ear to do simple and obvious things.<br/><br/>My engagement level for this show died out really fast.<br/><br/>Not cool. I would say seasons 1 through 3 are hands down the most suspensful, creative and heartfelt seasons I have ever seen. The Flash is my favorite show by far on Netflix. I was very suprised because I'm not a huge superhero fan or superhero type of movie lover until watching the flash. But I must say season 4 is horendous. What did they do switch up the director and writers? Everything is off from the story line, to the camera angles to ever little piece of the show. It's like the whole show is zoomed in and you can't even see what is going on. They must have hired new people to write and direct this show because it is nothing like the first three seasons. You most definitely want to watch the first three if you are a superhero comic fan however. I would say the best seasons in a row are, Season 3, 1, and finally 2. All great seasons. Do not waste your time with season 4. You will ask for your life back. Way to turn the Flash into a joke. I only watched this show because I had nothing else to do and I saw that the ratings are 8.6. The show sucked from the first episode, it's so dumb that makes you wanna hit the wall with your head. It seems like a 9 year old kid wrote the whole script. I don't even know where to begin ***Spoiler***: 1- How to hack a highly secured server? 3 seconds of hitting the keyboard, what??? 2- A man with a real gun can be easily handled by the flash, another man with a stupid ice gun seems impossible for the flash !!! 3- The flash cannot overrun bees !!! 4- " Barry: Bees are attacking again!! Felicity: Bee careful" What is that??? who wrote this sh**t? who say something like that in a situation like that?? and you can imagine how the other conversations went. 5- How to run throw things? the flash vibrates himself to air frequency !!!! what the hell is that?? 6- Barry tells everyone that he is the flash except for Iris to keep her safe?? what about the rest?? and by the way she's still not safe anyway. 7- A tsunami hitting the city how to handle this? Run fast enough back and forth to create an air barrier !! can you imagine scientists deal with tsunamis the same way? this is pure stupidity. The tl;dr for those who don't want to read: A disappointing show that insults the viewer with idiotic writing to force the plot forward. Hardcore die-hard fans of The Flash will like this, but everyone else will find this to be an exercise in frustration.<br/><br/>SPOILERS ahead. You've been warned.<br/><br/>Okay, so I'm not the biggest DC fan. I grew up reading some Batman and maybe some Superman, but my base of knowledge is in fact more Marvel oriented than DC. That said, I do like The Flash and find him and most of the other superheroes that can access the Speed Force to be some of the most interesting characters in comics.<br/><br/>This show does a pretty decent job of capturing how powerful The Flash can be. When he goes fast, he really goes fast. The thing is though, he's fast. Which means he should be able to solve a lot of problems very easily. But because the writers want to create a sense of tension and have him come up against obstacles he can't just bulldoze through, he doesn't use his powers in those ways. He gets into fights he should be able to easily win, but because he stops and stands there doing nothing for several minutes he gets hit many times. And then he goes fast and ends the fight in an instant. It's ridiculous.<br/><br/>The character relations are also very poorly executed. There are so many instances of characters happening to be in the right place at the right time to hear the right thing in order to push the plot forward. It's just such lazy writing I have to wonder how much the writers even respect what they're writing. I would expect better writing from amateur level writers since they would at least be learning what sort of novice mistakes not to make. There are so many instances of a character dramatically entering the room after overhearing something that I have to wonder whether I'm watching one of those cheesy soap operas rather than something that takes itself more seriously.<br/><br/>And then there's Iris. I'm not going to talk about how they changed her race, likely only for the sake of including an African American on their show (token racial diversity character). But even if she had been casted with an actor that was actually true to the source material, there's still no saving her from the atrocity that her character is. She's such a wishy washy character that can't decide what she wants to do that she's pretty much an insult to the "strong female character" that she's supposed to be. And then there's the scenes where she's angry at her boyfriend for keeping secrets from her. Her boyfriend that is a detective and may be legally bound to keep secrets. Her boyfriend that is in fact keeping a secret that if he reveals may put many people in grave danger. And we have Iris getting angry at her boyfriend for keeping secrets because she doesn't think people in a relationship are allowed to keep secrets. Right. Wow. Such horrid writing. Her character is completely ruined by it. It's obvious this happened to push the plot forward, but it could have been done so much better that all I can feel is disappointment.<br/><br/>I mean, not everything is bad with this show. There is a lot of fanservice, hinting at many DC heroes and villains that any devoted fan will be delighted to see. The spin the television show has on many of these characters is interesting, and it's definitely cool to see The Flash go up against mainstays of his rogues gallery like Captain Freeze. And there are some scenes and ideas that show a glint of the potential the show has. The thing is though, it's just so marred by the horrible writing that it's only being held aloft by the history and fanbase behind The Flash.<br/><br/>And at least it's staying mostly true to the comics, unlike Arrow that is really more Batman in disguise, or Gotham that essentially had nothing to do with the comics. It's always nice to see a show that actually respects its source material instead of writing something else entirely while only taking advantage of the characters for name recognition.So points for that, I guess.<br/><br/>It's just such a disappointment for a show like this with so much potential to become so bad due to inept writers. I don't know whether they're being held back by studio meddling, as much of what comes out of CW tends to be somewhat teenage trashy. Or perhaps they think they're writing for children because they think only children like comics and thus they can get away with this sort of rubbish. I don't know. It's just very clear that the writing that's being churned out is very subpar and is a disgrace to the franchise. Overall it's a soap in comic hero clothes. The family drama, the continue resetting of the relationships due to manipulation of the timeline, the boring love story with Iris... I mean it's exhausting. Last drop was the mystical episode of Barry meeting the speed force or its representative. Now the speed force is god? FFS. Besides shouldn't the Flash be a funny character? Because this Barry is quite boring. He isn't even a hero despite how many times it gets repeated in the show. He spends his time putting patches to the disasters he himself provokes because of unresolved mum issues. And with all those scientists who can do things "more advanced than CERN" nobody explains him not to do it. I give it 5 because I like Harrison Wells character - pity he's not much in season 3 - and the visual effects are pretty good. This is the best TV show out there! It is filled with new surprises in every episode. The actors and actresses are amazing in acting and the story line and plot are also amazing. They have the best villains out there (Reverse Flash, Zoom and soon Godspeed. This is filled with comedy, action, suspense and thriller, it is all in one. Tuesday's are my favourite day of the week because of Flash. I love this TV show and highly recommend this to people looking to watch a good TV show. People that are writing hate comments against this TV show are just Marvel Fanboys. This is much better than Arrow, Daredevil, Agents of shield and much other out there in my opinion. <br/><br/>BEST TV SHOW! The flash is the awesome TV for the superhero stuff season ever the show is awesome , The episodes are off the hooks the theme of making flash with the current 21st century is one to watch the aliens and collaboration with Arrow and also upcoming DC's Legends is coming soon too but flash character is one to watch with great graphics and major speed of flash and his competitors are just have to see show there are many new awesome aliens the reverse Flash The future Barry Allen The greatest scene was Barry is getting the speed and awesome then comes the cisco and Katlin who joins to fight against evil thats just awesome a team against evil WOW The flash was great it had action and many other things a good TV show needs. But it wasn't as dark as arrow what I think made it a whole lot better. I like how they had to use CGI for many of the cut scenes but they didn't use it's over whelming power too much. I hope anyone who reads this enjoyed my review of the flash. The Flash was awesome. I recommend you go check it out. It's a great show I reckon you'll love it. And also maybe go check out other shows like the flash, e.g arrow Bye the way next season's suit looks way cooler. Go check out some of my other reviews. And for now this was my review of the flash it is on the CW network. Thank you and goodbye Recently, new making the quality series is "The Flash". Smartly screenplay the whole movie scripts ( some places can seem pointless ), and by having a team of talented , but the positive / negative review to the criticism made â€‹â€‹of 2014 series 1 season final of the followers also left a trail effect . Often we see the flashback directory "Arrow" by conducting joint law are also different flavors to the audience . We look forward to continued success in the fall and moving to the beat of the directory. I hope the new season in Series A doctor Harrison Wells makes the true identity of return. And hopefully again people will come from time to our present time . Thanks... As a big fan of super hero movies and television, I was very much looking forward to the first episode of the Flash. Particularly given Arrow is one of my favourite shows, and this new version is a spin off, or at least heavily connected to that series.<br/><br/>As with Arrow, many of the elements and characteristics of the original comic book hero have been kept, although many are also adapted or even ignored to appeal to a more modern and mainstream audience.<br/><br/>As with the original comic book character Barry Allen (Grant Gustin), is a police scientist, or CSI investigator in this case, who is still a highly moral individual despite his history and profession. This was an important aspect of the character that had to be kept as it was central to who he was. In Justice #8 (2006), Batman says, "Barry is the kind of man that I would've hoped to become if my parents hadn't been murdered." Like the original character Allen is also always late, however unlike the original Barry Allen this version is much younger, and is not married. He does however still reside in Central City.<br/><br/>Of course viewers of Arrow will already be somewhat familiar with this version of Barry Allen, as he was introduced to audiences in the second half of season two of that show. This was a good move by the producers, as it creates an existing connection between the character and the audience before the new show actually airs.<br/><br/>The series starts with a flashback from Allen's past when his mother was apparently killed by some strange (electrical?) phenomenon. His father was jailed for the murder and remains in prison, although Barry believes him to be innocent and has been investigating the death on his own for many years. No doubt, this investigation will be a continuing theme throughout the series, or at least the early seasons.<br/><br/>The circumstances that transform Barry Allen into the Flash are again similar to the original comic book in that he is struck by lightning and doused by a mixture of chemicals. Although in this version a particle accelerator built by Star Labs triggered the storm when it blew up after being turned on for the first time. I suspect this too will play a major part further down the track.<br/><br/>Particularly given Allen awakes from a nine month coma in Star Labs (or at least what was left of it after the explosion), and that is where he discovers his new powers, and also how to use and control them. Star Labs and its owner Harrison Wells (Tom Cavanagh), also supply Allen with his suit. But is Wells helping Allen for purely altruistic reasons, or has he another agenda that will reveal itself it coming episodes? <br/><br/>Jesse L. Martin (Law and Order), plays Detective Joe West who helped raise Barry after his father was sent to prison and works alongside him. His daughter Iris West (Candice Patton), who of course was Allen's wife in the comic book, is more like a sister in this series, although Allen wishes for more.<br/><br/>While it had its faults I really enjoyed the first episode of the Flash, and look forward to seeing the direction the show will take. The production values were high, which is to be expected as DC and Warner Bros. are behind the series, so the special effects were also of high quality. The acting was solid, and the script while not providing anything really new, did allow for some intriguing possibilities in the future.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of super hero shows, and in particular Arrow, I highly recommend giving this series a go. While at this early stage I would not wish to compare the two, one thing that is obvious is the Flash will not be as dark as Arrow. Whether that's a good thing or not, is entirely up to you. 7/10 Wow!!! Stupid doesn't BEGIN to describe this show. Not sure how many times they used the word "doppelganger" throughout the seasons. If I had a penny for each time I could retire a very happy and rich person. Also, what is WITH the "whisper" dude????? His ability to never speak in a normal tone is not only annoying, but grates on the nerves to the point of exasperation. The younger people who are made to look like they're 20, but supposed to act like they're 40 acting like 20, are ridiculous at best. Seriously, this show is beyond stupid. The series is badly-written and everyone can't act (except Jesse L. Martin & Tom Cavanagh). They don't show the villains that much they're more focus on Barry Allen and his friends personal lives makes for too much soap opera in this series. There only a couple episodes that were okay/good. Barry is more like Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man. Barry personality was better when he first appear in Arrow, he was more likable. Barry and Iris remind me of Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson like relationship. Iris and Wally are annoying at times. I prefer Wally West/The Flash II in Justice League animated series better. Wentworth Miller and his partner-in-crime and Mark Hamill are the only ones that make this show work when they guest stars. This series is meant for teens & my age group, prefer to watch Arrow instead. The Flash benefits from its purposefully light atmosphere, making it a superhero show uniquely geared toward genre fans as well as novices. With distinctive visuals and a terrific cast, The Flash remains one of the strongest comic book shows on television, all while remaining action-packed, funny, and dramatic. There is light amid the darkness, The Flash sports a great cast, visually well-designed sets and effects, and the pace and atmosphere reflect the deft hands of directors and crew. Not every superhero program has to be a somber affair and this light-hearted and wonderfully upbeat program proves that week after week. It remains a show about a superhuman that's just as concerned with the "human" as it is with the "super" and the end result is charming.... The entire series and it's intelligence can be summed up in one sentence:<br/><br/>According to the show, the proper way to get rid of a giant destructive black hole is to punch it really really hard and then blow it up. ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME?!<br/><br/>The characters are worse than simply unrelatable, they are annoying and often you end up hating them. They make the same obvious mistakes over and the plot is repetitive to the point there is actually a formula for it. Barry charges in like an idiot, gets beaten, returns to create a scientifically BS plan, then go back out and get a "motivational three word speech", every episode.<br/><br/>The drama is overly forced and often the solution is so obvious to the viewer. And basically half the character's are whining spoiled morons (IRIS), that create unneeded drama for the decent characters even when the decent character has done nothing wrong, then forces the good character to apologize for the sake of "character development".<br/><br/>AN UTTER INSULT TO SCIENCE. The science makes no sense and breaks even kindergarten level science lessons. And even worse, they constantly try to cover it up by using fancy big science words thinking their audience is too stupid to figure out what they're saying. Well I hate to break it to you, but this is a comic book series, which means the audience that your trying to fool are science geeks like myself, BRILLIANT PLAN!<br/><br/>The music like in most CW shows is loud and blares over the dialogue to the point you cant even here the speakers, and the upbeat music makes any serious and genuinely dramatic moments into jokes. And finally, also like most CW shows the dialogue is terrible and doesn't sound human or natural. I'm pretty impressed with The Flash. Although it's not as dark or gritty as Arrow it still has its place in the superhero world. As someone who didn't really know much about Barry Allen or his alter ego before watching the show I am actually really enjoying it. The main cast are pretty adorable which wouldn't normally be wise for this kind of genre but I personally find they add a bit of lightness to the show. The weekly villains provide the chaos and destruction so it's pretty well balanced.<br/><br/>I'm not going to recommend this show to the die-hard comic book fans but for the general masses who like a bit of exciting fantasy in their lives then it's a really fun entertaining show. Show has gone downhill, too much feminism and making flash look like a simp for his own show and nothing like arrow Insanely stupid. One shot to the head through the eye ball would end every season in episode 1. Bullets are flying everywhere and no one gets shot? How is everyone not able to hit a target?
Half way through season two and glad to see the disgusting anti-moral homo parade is not front stage yet. Seriously, these deviants need help. We need a homosexual rehab no different from all the other mentally disturbed. Both this and Arrow are very childish anoying bad series.
They try to make some first degree drama scenes around poor and totally unrealistic action scenes. It is soo bad a 10 years old boy can make this kind of script without any scripting knowledge.
It is always the same pattern. A new vilain for each episode to make some action Flash or Arrow beat the vilain and their poor Dallas drama life continue to the next episode where another vilain comes from nowhere to kill some people..... of course everything is linked with the life of the hero because of course heroes have a destiny. So tired of that cliche.
Save your preciuos time and skip these ones to see the Marvel series. No comparison. One of great season that added to The Flash that target on Nora as the time-breaker! Flash-ly scenes that evolving from the past seasons where everything are so cool and improved! More effects that make the scene so beautiful as it does make me cry! Unbelievably describe this kind of advanced technology has been use is amazing! Anyways, back to the point where I want to critique on this kind of show. Nora, a daughter of Barry and Iris who come from the future. The real plan of her's has not been discover until its very last minute that brought the people to shock. That kind of developments is wow-ing me! I do like how this television show productions has balance the individual charcaters' parts so we can watch them growing through the series. It does show an extraordinary impact in between the characters. I had been watch this season very close and leave me speechless. Very tearful but hateful enough to know how it suppose to be ending. One choices won't impact the next but it will always impact in later future when we all are not really expected of it.
That is does show you how much it got me really good with this kind of season with full of excellent actors that include Nora! She does a good job and I meaning it. I binged season 1 of this show when season 2 was airing. Then when season 2 hit Netflix I binged that. I then watched season 3 and 4 as they aired, but then I realized how bad this series really is. The first season was slow, but so was season 2 of Gotham and I love that show. The first season was well thought out and the story was good, it just never really took off. Fun show all the same. Come season 2 he is more iconic and the villain is much better, a little more of season 1 stuff, the big crossover, it was fun. The twist at the end was a game changer and it was overall a more alive season. Come season 3 everything is crazy, who we thought was the villain was kickin ass for the first half of the season before SAVATAIR showed up then he sucked, flashpoint was rushed they killed off the new fun wells instead of iris who got hella annoying. The show was at its downfall. They wrapped it up ok, the twist was fine and the season was just blah. Come season r they just rush right out of season 3's end twist and bull crap begins. There was a time jump so everybody is said and crap, but we were like that's it? All of the trying to prevent the death of iris stuff in the season before was dumb, and I was cheering for her to die, then when Malloy from Harry Potter as Julian never showed up in season 4 I was like what the heck. Actors began to suck or not be in every episode. The villain was great but the show was getting corny. After the season ended I binged all 4 seasons of Gotham.
I started season 5 and realized how bad and corny it was compared to Gotham, so I stopped watching. I will binge the season when it shows up on netflix, but until then I was sad to see it in its downfall. Season 2 was great and besides the cheap fight scenes and goofs I liked season 4. It had a lit villain and a cool twist, but it seems like every season premiere is crap, because they don't know how to play off of what the did in the last season well, it feels rushed and way to chill. So I will write another review come start of season 6 and after binging season 5, but for now there have been 2 good seasons 1 meh season and one trash season which was season 3. So I'm gonna give it to you people and say season 5 got better but the shows so cheesy so ima give this 6/10 and that's generous. When my brother first started watching flash I would normally be doing something or watching parts with him but when the story got interesting I watched the whole season again and now every week I watch a new episode. I'll idmit some episodes are boring like season 4 episode 11 and 12
And some more time to time but other than that it's excellent.this show is perfect if you want to binge watch a show there is 4 seasons on Netflix already.the worst season is season 4 but it is still good as a show. It is better than arrow and supergirl and is perfect for D.C. and arrowverse fans First season was great second was really good not as good as the first but still good 3rd was ok really nice villain but missed some key stuff season 4 was not good but with the latest season everything is good it might be as good as the first one The flash ⚡ season 5 is awesome, Mind blowing and superb after the weak story line and low rating of very slow season 4 this is the great come back by flash ⚡ tv series. If you like action seasons I recommend this season and if you are marvel or DC fan then you have to see the flash ⚡ season 5. I hope they will do more better to their story line and tv series in up coming years No comments on the best show... It has everything you need The only plot that has made sense on this show is that of the supergenius nemesis in the recent season. His plan is to take away the planet's intelligence. You see, he just wants to make everyone love this show again. I can't say much about it, but I think it is a great show!It is sometimes predictable and there are some really stupid choices that The Flash team makes, like changing the time line sometimes without really needing to. In most of the comics,Barry is a really comedic character but in this show he is always serious and thinking about the future and the time line and stuff like that. But for anyone who is going to watch this show, this is not the comic book flash. But I personally, love this show! It was hard for me to come up with a sensible review, as there were many things that I enjoyed about this series, but some aspects made me more than irritated when watching. The strong points of Flash are that the show is rather chipper, with lovely Gustin Grant in the lead as Barry Allen aka the Flash. Grant plays well as the nerdy, but cute hero of Central City, who is supported by a small team of experts (nerds) of probably everything science. The team and other main characters have their moments but most of the time, the dialogue is a bit too forced and the acting dull. Especially the mandatory love interest Iris West is the living cliché of a superhero girlfriend, who tends to be both boring and annoying, and it doesn't make it any better that Candice Patton seems to be a woman with only one facial expression. <br/><br/>Some character flaws however are mostly due to the bad and sloppy script writing that plagues the show from time to time. Some of the highlights showcasing this aspect include, but are not limited to the following: 1) A big city of millions of people happens to have only two detectives, who solve all the crimes (especially all related to the new emerging metahumans). 2) The 20 somethings run the STAR lab all day everyday, without any other priorities in life. 3) Two super criminals have blasters that could freeze/burn all the cops, but they only aim for their shields and not their legs, which are visible. And flash doesn't grab their guns even though he could with his quick feet as other people have pointed out (continuity?). 4) One of the most laughable moments was episode 14, where the cosy twosome of Ronnie/Stein merged in Ronnie's body, explodes, but somehow they both survive and have separated into two different bodies? Their clothes are a little burned, but honestly, if Ronnie didn't turn into a 3D printer during the explosion, where on Earth did Stein's body magically appear from (with glasses and all)? The show has similar kind of goofs, but this was just plain stupid.<br/><br/>Still, even though the intelligence of the viewer is sometimes underestimated with the aforementioned things, the show is still entertaining if you let things slide. Why, it's hard to tell. Somehow I find humor in the crappy script writing and the poor written characters. Flash itself is an interesting character and I like the cross references they have with the Arrow for instance. And as a lover of the whole superhero genre itself, I can see why this series is getting a strong liking from the fan base as all in all, it's well-intentioned even with all its faults. <br/><br/>In conclusion I kind of hate to love this show, but still it's fun to love hating it too. First I want to say, I am a devout fan of the DC Universe. However I am beginning to wane on my expectations of the The Flash series.<br/><br/>If Flashpoint is a precursor to what is to come, then I have to say, "shame on the writers for being lazy and half witted." The plot is to whacked, and by whacked I mean the story line feels forced, desperate, and doubled with some horrific costumes, ugh! I foresee this series "to be a cancel" after this season, that is if the writers don't tone down the involuntary guillotining of the scripts, and ease up on the cheese factor. Otherwise heads will roll before the Justice League story line is firmly in place. Okay so I had to write this review just to tell you, in short, to not watch it. So somehow this universe is interconnected with the arrow superwoman and all that. Now franchise wise I do like how they are interconnected. For that I give them some high scores because the transition and timeline is in sync without a hitch, and well, that makes me want to watch other shows as well just to keep up. However.. This show with the arrow infuriate, stresses me out so much I can't keep watching for more than three episodes straight. What's up with the writers and producers who are making everything so stilted and awkward? Story is worse, things just keep happening one after another that just don't connect or seems ridiculous to the point where the main character seem stupid, and that is just not good when you want your viewers to keep watching the show without achieving it and and later revisit just to fulfill your curiosity as to what happens next; now me watching the show is not dependent on liking the show, it's dependent on my curiosity to find out what's next; ipso facto I'm furious For those of you who would rather wind up than wind down go for it. But remember to have a squeezy ball with you cause I needed one Great idea, OK overall story... i mean nothing to special, but hey its OK.<br/><br/>How ever, 9/10 of the problems the flash encounters could EASY be negated if you only had superhuman speed.. wait .. he have that, but for some reason he do not use it to fight the supervillains. <br/><br/>So how fast is he.. well fast enough so he can easy out speed a bullet, a standard bulet fires at 400 M/S<br/><br/>the fastest punch in the world is like 20 M/s so he at least move 20 times faster than that, so he can pick a bullet out of the air, but cant block a punch from a villain ?<br/><br/>Also he build a roadblock to redirect a motorcycle gang, instead of just taking their keys, and carry em to 1 place...<br/><br/>He stand and wait for a villain to fire a thing .. but when you move faster than a bullet, perhaps you could take the gun before he ever fires it?<br/><br/>or instead of letting the villain type on a computer and fight her killer robots, perhaps just slap her 1 time so she stops typing....<br/><br/>and so on and so on...<br/><br/>Basically almost EVERY hard spot he ever gets in could have been prevented if you had only had superhuman speed... Well i usually review a show after the 1st or the 2nd episode but for a show as big as this one and for the huge commercializing and publicity it got before even it premieres i had to wait ;) So i'm reviewing this after 15 episodes now and things are unexpectedly going well ,, like really well.<br/><br/>The show plot moved amazingly from just a guy who's foolishly dealing with his new power to a guy dealing with others have somehow similar ones,, personal problems ,, comedy bits and thrilling drama. <br/><br/>The storyline is just moving towards unpredictable characters in the show ,so some people you want expect they're bad will appear to be really bad .., the plot is still tight ,well written so far, i didn't really see any noticeable mistakes or questionable scenes ,, because "as many shows have in their first 10-15 episodes" every scene most be strong and well prepared, shot and edited months ago ..<br/><br/>The Cast were just okay at first but when you engage with them so much in the scenes you'll see they're doing a great job ..<br/><br/>They also bring to the show a lot of people we've seen on TV before like the "Scofield brothers" from Prison Break and "Stephen Jameson" from The Tomorrow People :)<br/><br/>The only episode (and that's maybe only me ) which i thought was a bit off , is the one when they brought The Arrow ,, i mean it went somehow cheesy but they recovered quickly till the best episode so far and the one made me write this review,, episode 15 ... just WOW ..<br/><br/>So overall the show started just fair then turned to maybe one of the best shows not only on CW but on TV this year ;)<br/><br/>Well for that it is indeed recommend . Its really sad to see what CW is doing to these iconic action heroes. I grew up a fan of DC comics especially the Flash, and to see what CW is doing to them is just sad. Not even the their greatest foe could have ruined these heroes as badly as CW. In reality what we are being dished out here is Mills and Boone adaption of DC comics. Something no one ever would have dreamt of seeing. With all the great CGI and actors today you would think that we would get a decent true to form action comic TV series. So many great villains so many plots no need for sloppy mindless romance and chit chat. Marvel is getting it right, sadly not DC or CW. "The show is very childish. If it is only for kids than I guess I can praise the show. One thing irritated me throughout the show that the hero runs extremely fast and shows of his speed skills in many unnecessary ways. But when he is fighting against the villain he waits right in front of the villain to say the dialog and get his ass kicked. Flash saves people from burning building and flying car but can not take the villain to somewhere else through speed or cant even take the gun from his hand instead he waits to dodge the bullet. What type of absurd is that? Another thing I saw that there were some college kids as the most skillful researchers. No seriousness in acting only focus is on glamor. Crime happening and the flash group can see everything from their lab. The whole concept is lame than animation its just baseless."<br/><br/>I will just say plain up that I'm only reposting this other guys review. All I will add is that he was right on target about what he said. Everything The Flash – The TV series The Flash is a wonderful program for the fans of the speedster and lovers of the DC universe. The program starts with Barry Allan's back story which is in his lab at central city's police department. Before Barry became the flash he worked as a something helping the detectives in the building and major crimes. On the night he becomes the impossible he is in his lab working when a massive explosion goes off and spreads across the city striking Barry and keeping him in a coma for nine months. When he wakes he finds himself in a completely different universe. Barry had missed so much of his life to the explosion, everyone was different, all changed with different lives to live. Why is the suit brown? Does the cameraman use a brown filter for effect or does somebody think that a brown suit is ultra chic? The suit is supposed to be red. Red is aesthetically pleasing and inherently associated with the character. Please make the costume red. The stories so far are great and the tie-in to another series, Arrow, is interesting and allows for some exciting possibilities as these two incredible series interact. All of the characters are well cast and a joy to watch as each story unfolds. As I have not read comic books in many years most of the characters are unfamiliar to me. That's OK, it only makes the show more interesting and fresh. There are clues within the story that there is more going on than is fully revealed in each episode. That makes a nice little teaser and whets my appetite for the next installment. This is already one of my regular must watch programs this season. I've watched this show from day one and really enjoyed it. Problem is, it got predictable very quickly. The cross over episodes are terrible. Characters such as Iris...a waitress turned super reporter/ head of Star Labs (who pays for Star Labs upkeep and tech? Barry rob banks when we're not watching lol) and her woeful acting and dialogue....Nora again terrible actress and behaves like a petulant 5 year old....not a 20-30 year old woman!<br/><br/>I watched upto "GodSpeed" but just could not handle the childish behaviour of Nora & Friend and as for her being a CSI.....she has an armband that does the work, she just reads what it says so why is she considered a CSI.<br/><br/>Seems this show is too brutal for children and absolute poorly acted garbage for teens/ adults....shame, it started quite well. The story, execution and the characters all seem to fit the situation. It's just too obvious. The man that small Barry saw when his mother was killed is none other than he 'HIMSELF'. He runs fast enough and travels time...goes in the time when his mom was killed and tries to save her but fails. I wont disclose what kills her. This part is similar to the story in Justice league:Flashpoint paradox. The Graphics is just too awesome. And the physics freaks will of-course love this. Worth a watch but is not worth the rating given here. A 7 is perfect. It may get interesting there are more episodes to come out. Well hope for the best. Season 1 was amazing , over the time this movie is suck. Its getting way out of control. Gonna delete and stop watching it. And IRIS character is so damn Annoying. She should be out of the movie. Disappointment started after season 2. Let me begin by stating I absolutely love this show! Great writing, great casting even a great theme. Barry Alan just gets the crap kicked out of him and endeavors on. My only issue is with Iris Wests character. She is SUPER selfish, especially in season 1. In season 2 her actions become reckless and selfish. In season 3 it's just more of the same. Other than her I have no complaints. Therefore I give this show a 10/10. If I can look past her I hope others can. The show is totally worth it. Buy it, rent it, stream it...watch it! In my opinion this show ROCKS! Thank you for reading my review on CW's The Flash. First season was fun, but after the flash-point happened series gotten worse and worse, writing is very bad, problems are very artificial and heroes are overreacting about unlogical things, fights don't make sense, only few actors are doing a good job like the actress who played Gypsy. Im disappointed in those series, it could have been something great. Just look how agents of shield evolved, characters are very real and you can understand and feel their feelings, flash just seems so fake, it's like they took a total amateur and let him write the scenario. I'm not gonna lie. I thought this show was going to be an absolute childish, and pathetic show about a guy with superpowers. I thought it was going to be a stereotypical plot like Spiderman and it's always the same thing. However, this show really blew my expectations. I didn't start the show when it first aired and instead binge watched it online, but it doesn't take away from how incredible the show is. If I learned anything, you really have to watch the show to understand how great it really is. Don't judge a book by its cover, and especially give this show a chance. It's completely different from what I expected it to be.<br/><br/>It's mind-blowing how great the acting is also. I mean, Grant Gustin, the main character, is a phenomenal actor. I mean, you have to watch the show itself to understand what I mean. His genuine passion, humor, and intensity is indescribable. Especially with Grant, they showed an emotional and vulnerable side to him that many strong, male protagonist's lack these days. Also, I love how romance is not a main priority on this show. Yes, it is a big part of it, but the show doesn't feed to fan girls and allows the character's relationships to build with great time and detail. The undeniable, underlying chemistry between Grant Gustin and Candace Patton is not blatantly addressed all the time which also creates great anticipation for when a moment between these two come. The humor that Carlos Valdez provides is a great comic relief for times when the show brings out its intense side. Danielle Panabaker is also this great, strong, female character that is a breath of fresh air with her intelligence and personality. And Tom Cavanagh's character is developed so patiently and beautifully that you just have to watch the show to fully appreciate his style.<br/><br/>I promise you, that this show will not disappoint. With only 2 seasons so far, still in it's second season, this show has become my favorite, hands down, and is worth to take the time out and watch! There's not much i can say except this is the greatest show ever!!!<br/><br/>I started watching this and i couldn't stop!! this show is amazing the acting and the plot are great even there is a lot of CGI it looks really good.<br/><br/>It can be boring at sometimes but screw that!!:)<br/><br/>When i started watching this i thought it was real cool, and a show i would like but as i watched more i loved even more!<br/><br/>I have always liked The Flash but now i love him!!!! by the way Grant Gustin is the perfect fit for Barry Allen!<br/><br/>I CANT WAIT FOR SEASON TWO TO START AGAIN!!! I just finished watching the latest episode of Flash, which introduces Wally West, and this will be the last episode I watch. I look forward to hearing that the show was canceled, and I guarantee you that it will based on this new casting. The episode was great until the introduction of Wally West. <br/><br/>Grant Gustin you've done a phenomenal job portraying Barry Allen, and I look forward to seeing you in many other things. Candice Patton and Danielle look amazing on camera, and I'm sure I'll see you again as well. This show has given me many nights of enjoyment. Take care and best of luck to the cast. Spoilers are not intentional, but i may let slip something in excitement. <br/><br/>I found this a great series, finding in equal measures thrill, joy, emotions, inspiration and above all a very nice depiction of all the heroic characteristics one can have. The characters are amazing in their roles. Except perhaps Iris West, she was really annoying sometimes. <br/><br/>Grant Gustin really fits the image of the Flash we have in our mind who is funny and responsible in equal measures. <br/><br/>The buildup of the story is just fantastic only to be matched by the climax of it. Though the story really gets intense near the ending it was a pleasure for me watching the first part also. Apart from all the plot points and the fights the story also have large number of comic reliefs and a feel-good feel. You can't help but like the characters present. <br/><br/>Also a great thanks to the creators for this amazing experience. Eagerly waiting for season 2, i know the Flash won't disappoint. Have a look everyone, great show. It's okay so far the plot lines aren't always bad and childish. I think they should make the villains last for 2-3 episodes so it looks more realistic and less confusing. But glad to see Ally Heng in this series can't wait to see what she's got now. Grant is a good actor and most are but the character Iris kinda annoyed me since she's very weird and doesn't seem to fit into The Flash Universe. I think she should be in Arrow instead. Well that's what I think about the characters don't get angry if you don't agree with me because this is just my opinion. By the way who likes the crossovers between Arrow and The Flash? Since I think the crossovers are really really cool. I love Arrow. And because of that I decided to watch Flash. I don't know why, but it seems to me that Arrow is much more intense than this. Effects are great and "fighting" scenes are pretty average. What I like about this TV- Show is well designed villains or in this case "meta-humans". There is some cheesy dialogs between Iris and Barry/Flash, but I can accept that. I predict 2 seasons, maybe 3. Grant Gustin is perfect actor for this role... I will continue to watch this and I hope I won't disappoint.<br/><br/>So, I recommend everyone who's watching Arrow, to try with this "speed" TV-Show! It was very fun and Enjoyable till season 2.Idk what happened to the writers.Everybody in town have superpower and every friend of Him is flash too...It's boring then.. One of the BEST SCI_FI TV SHOWS i have ever seen !!!
Story, Cast, VFX, etc Everything is Tremedous,
Sci-fi full of Action,
I just love this Show, just Amazing,
Best Regards This show goes from mediocre to absolutely terrible. Childish acting. Inconsistent abilities, plot holes the size of the multi-verse, Ridiculous decisions, and on and on... Season 4 starts the forced political and LGBT agenda. I say forced because they're not subtle at all. This series starts out for viewers 14 and older, but quickly goes to 14 and younger. When season 4 is done, I'm done. This show has hit my top 3 shows i've seen, and it's not even done. Brilliant show, beat my prison break record of watching 12 episodes on a Sunday, watch 15 episodes which made that day. Top show, i've seen many shows but this is really good, 10/10<br/><br/>I thought this would be one of those shows that i could watch just 1 or 2 episode a day. Nope, underestimated it. Finished the 22 episodes in 2 days, what? At work i just kept thinking of it. Never expected that. Well anyways, this show isn't over and there's a lot to watch. <br/><br/>I probably should of waited for it to completely finish, then i could of finished the show in about 5 days? Unbelievable show. 11/10 if possible Despite the fact that it is a reboot of the 1990 series that starred john Wesley snipp who played Barry Allen ends up playing Barry's father and the title role is now played by grant gustin and does a rather splendid job playing the role. The story deals with Barry who is trying to find out who was the one responsible for his mothers murder and finding out who framed his father. What I like about Barry despite the fact that he starts out as a geeky and socially awkward that you wouldn't expect to be a superhero but when a thunderstorm causes the particular accelerator to explode thus putting Barry in a coma for nine months and giving him his super speed. What Barry finds out that he is not the only superhuman with abilities. While the show is lighter in toned than arrow but the show is still enjoyable. With soapy melodramatic side-stories which necessarily must include LGBTQ agenda and weak plot lines with holes you could pass a planet through. As usual, ratings drop and frantic writers seek to correct their original mistaken woke-ness with ever greater woke-ness - forgetting the original genius. For instance iris west worst character ever! Just one of many things... few little tweaks this show could be absolutely amazing! Barry is perfectly played by grant gustin all the cast is good except some episodes this show has good story Making Series From Comic Is So Hard.Showing A hero That Every Episode Save People and Win Will Get boring after A while.But in the flash You will never get bored.Unexcepted Event,Complex Story,.... and Most important,Excellent Act By cost Make this series a Fantastic Series.
You Will Cry When Character cry and you will laugh when they laugh and It will Impact your everyday life And it will force you to think Are you doing write in your life or not. DC is just a sounding board for liberal Hollywood...what a shame because this show had some real juice to it...but it died in Hollywood rediculousness. Flash is the best. I hope it never stops 💕
The way they act in the serial, the way they handle each and every meta human problem as a team is the best thing i like. I like team flash and when arrow joins them. 👌🏻 If you look at classic super heroes like spiderman and superman, romance actually is given quite lot of room. 
To me this type of classic super hero is defined not by himself but rather two things his enemies his trying to stop or enemy. 
And his love interest, often a childhood love. <br/><br/>To me this show fails mainly based on the romance angle not working This show has become truly amazing and most of the people who watch the show only watch the show and fail to realize that this show mostly goes off the comic books, this show adapts the comic books surprisingly well, Grant Gustin nails the role of flash and I was pleasantly surprised with who they casted as Iris bringing diversity to this wonderful show. I also admire the relationship that Barry shares with his step dad as well as the side love story of Barry and Iris. I'm eagerly waiting for season 5 keep up the good work DC. I absolutely cannot believe so many people are rating this show 1 star. The Flash has been an amazing TV series throughout each and every season, a show to go back to when your bored or sad to cheer you up. I KNOW THAT SOUNDS SUPER CHEESY - but it's honestly the truth.<br/><br/>This show admittedly is not perfect - but what show is? It has its flaws - there are many plot holes, there are some ridiculously stupid episodes (in terms of the situations the characters are put in), and some very cheesy moments. <br/><br/>But as a whole, it is a brilliant show. The good heavily outweighs the bad. The writing is mostly on point, the villains are amazingly portrayed, and the storyline in general loops around and ends each season very well.<br/><br/>So as a finishing statement, I'd say if you like superheroes at all and aren't too intensely worried by plot holes, then you will love this show. When this was announced i was very dubious but also quite enthusiastic about the idea of another Flash TV show, however them doubts in my mind were soon alleviated.<br/><br/>To start with the three seasons i have seen so far have tackled some great stories and villains. From Reverse Flash to Savitar i have been incredibly impressed by the depth and detail they have put into their villains. Team Flash have also impressed me by how coordinated they are on screen and its easy to see that everyone has good chemistry.<br/><br/>Grant Gustin as the Flash is great, Candice Patton as Iris is fantastic and Carlos Valdes as Cisco is one of the reasons the series keeps a good mix between both light sided stories and the more compelling dark sided stories.<br/><br/>Overall a very solid TV show and will definitely be tuning into seasons to come. 10/10. I can understand wanting to tinker with things to make a story work, but it is not the kind of thing that us comic fans really appreciate. I grew up on the Batman and Superman animated series' and went from there to Justice League and then started on some of the comics. And when you start overhauling characters in a way that might be taken as politically motivated, people get grouchy. The changes to Wonder Woman and Miss Marvel are exemplary of this.<br/><br/>But, I digress. I think rehashing the Barry Allen flash was a mistake in the first place, especially using old cast members from the first show to give it validation in the eyes of old fans. The only good thing that came out of the 90s flash was Mark Hamill started voicing the Joker soon after. Wally West was the comical flash that a lot of us grew up with and if you want to give us something new, give us a live action Jay Garrick main character, or maybe Bart Allen, arguably one of the best speedsters. Don't re- modulate and alter an existing work that has been done in live action already out of laziness.<br/><br/>P.S. The OCD among us nerds also tend to not like changes to minor characters near our favorite hero, as their interactions shape the hero. Today, I was walking down the street, and I stopped to think "the Reverse Flash should not run on its back ?!" It blew my mind. So here I am commenting on this, because I do not want other people to let themselves be carried away by this farce. Other than that Flash looks like a toy on the rope and runs away. #FORAFLASHREVERSO # REFLITÃO The Zoom dies, the Flash Reverse dies, Flash rapes the time line, the father of the Flash mine dies, the Flash is faster than lightning and the Kid Flash appears, they bet a race, Kid Flash lose. At the end of the first season Flash discovers that Reverse Flash is actually your teacher. #FORAFLASHREVERSO #REFLITÃO F*CK REVERSE FLASH BITCH*S "The Flash" is a well developed show all around. This show, unlike other superhero shows, didn't take a couple episodes to get really interesting. The cast is a very talented group of people. It seems the acting is better when the cast is more friendly with each other behind the characters and that's what made this show better. "The Flash" is full of action throughout the whole series as well as drama and comedy. The producer knew when to make the show funny and it was at the perfect moments too.<br/><br/>When watching this TV show, I seemed to never get bored and each episode it got more and more interesting. Personally, I don't think this show needs anything else to become a better show. I don't think it could become more intriguing. I've never watched any superhero shows so this is my first one watching, and it makes me want to watch other superhero shows. "The Flash" just didn't bring excitement, it showed that Barry Allen isn't just known as "The Flash". He is also a detective, while he works to get his Dad out of prison for a crime he didn't commit. <br/><br/>The effects in this show are outstanding. I can't really say I didn't like anything about this show but I know the cliffhangers can be annoying. The most neat part to me is how they didn't cram too much information in the first couple episodes. It is hard for people to get lost throughout the season. As well as having crossovers from other superhero TV shows makes the show more fascinating. <br/><br/>This superhero show "The Flash" is all around an outstanding TV series. I couldn't possibly be more intrigued. It brings standalone episodes introducing new villains through tiers of episodes. As well as all of the characters personal relationships. Bringing superpowers, science, and a psychic gorilla. It's more action-packed than other DC comic TV series out there. "The Flash" showing that it may not all be about superpowers to be a hero! Let's the good stuff out of the way: Pretty everything about season 1 was great (after a slow start, I'll admit) but the show took a sickening nosedive right off the bat in season 2.<br/><br/>What on earth happened?!? Your guess is as good as mine.<br/><br/>The scenes were more and more like something out of a badly written soap opera and, somehow, the cast's acting became tackier as well.<br/><br/>The show has replaced an interesting and captivating story with great plot twists with a god-awful, amateurish crap-fest full of cringe- worthy moments.<br/><br/>I am so disappointed, it saddens me... OK firstly I am a big fan of the show. It's one of the few shows I watch. But some episodes are just crazy. I mean a man shark seriously? And what on both Earths was the point of reopening the breach? They had found out Zoom was Jay/Hunter. They knew he was sick and dying. So why reopen the breach and try to confront him? WHY not leave him to succumb to his cellular degeneration? DUMBEST episode I ever saw! It is followed by more dumb episodes, but I hope once the show gets out of this insane story arc that it will get better, as it has done before. Don't get me wrong, I do like this show...just above off my chest. I also wish they did not do an AU thing with the supergirl crossover...too bad, Flash and Supergirl make a great couple. I claim that the worst character representation on the show is actually Iris West. The actress somehow found her way into the cast, and the show keeps trying to "fix" how much we dislike the representation by creating more scenarios and scripts that could make us fall in love back with the char. I actually never minded Iris West, and always thought the flash and Iris make a cute couple on the comic books. On the show, her unauthentic emotions, selfishness, and fake feelings are so annoying. The last cross over with Supergirl episode just annoyed the hell out of me - If Iris needs a miracle to fall in love and be happy with such a wonderful person, then she doesn't even deserve him to begin with. This is how much sadly you destroyed the char. She should simply die in the show if you have any desire for this show to survive. DC is doing a decent job at creating the chars but not like Marvel so far due to many reasons. I'd say DC get your things together and stop trying to prolong shows that decline in ratings just to keep the actors employed. If you draw a graph of the chars that gotten the most attention, and still have the lowest liking by audience Iris West is on the top, and if you don't take the proper action, you're killing the show. The flash lore has much more to offer. I look forward to much more and much better. The only reason I gave it a 9 instead of a 10 is that it's blatantly obvious a woman is in charge of the show. Bothing against women obviously, but the dialogue is so pro-woman and anti-masculinity it gets frustrating often. In addition, all the unnecessary lgbtq stuff sprinkled all over the show is just annoying.<br/><br/>My opinion. Awful TV Show! Worst TV Show! Worst Actors! Awful act! Everything related to this TV Show is something I can't describe with words! W8st of my time, life OMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG Can't believe someone likes this S**T!!! What else Americans wont make. People who like this, probably haven't seen any other TV Show. I feel petty for those who like this. Its a shame for IMDb, 8.4???????????? Fans love to watch superhero movies/TV-series because of heroes, story lines, and strong villains, not because they want to watch a romantic drama.<br/><br/>This season was so Iris-centric that it irritated me to the core. I'm so angry and disappointed with this season.<br/><br/>If I wanted to watch a rom-com, I would choose something else to watch, not this.<br/><br/>Why not rename the series to "The Iris Show" because that's what it looked like. She was the center of every episode.<br/><br/>I seriously hate Iris and Wally both, and nobody wants to see them as main characters. They are so irritating.<br/><br/>There's no logic and reason behind the actions of the Team Flash except one that if we don't do this, Iris is gonna die...bla..bla..bla.<br/><br/>Please let her die and save the series.<br/><br/>First two seasons were so great with The Reverse Flash and Zoom. Savitar somehow managed the intensity of a villain but that too was spoiled by killing him with the hands of Iris, with a gun..seriously? what is it?..a joke!!<br/><br/>It was kind of geeky when intelligent and brilliant Wells was there, It was fun to watch. But they replaced him with a joker Wells.<br/><br/>Season 3 is wrong at so many levels that if the writers don't decide to do something in the next season, The Flash which started as a great superhero series will become a below average romantic drama with a superhero. ** may contain spoilers ** Been watching from season 1 in-fact among three seasons s1 is my favourite. in season 3 they don't know what to do with remaining episodes between Barry knowing iris getting killed by Savitor and getting killed they dragged it sooo much, so much elastic drama. Iris west will speak obvious fact/things in middle of any discussion which are useless its like involving her unnecessarily . Barry becoming savitor!!!! For every accidental mistake there will be self blaming drama. seriously every time.scenes are so predictable. i don't read comics.New H.R is seriously annoying . his drum sticks waving every single time ...he better be villain again. I watch a lot of TV series and this is the best so far especially if you watch it at the same time as arrow. They've made each episode exciting and relevant to the main story line and they've opened it up for a number of different characters to come in and also intertwine with other series like arrow. The only thing that I could complain about is that there isn't a correct order to watch the arrow/flash in. I wish they would have cast Grant as the Flash in the upcoming Justice League film and I think that it was a massive mistake not to. Also I hope it works well with the upcoming Legends of Tomorrow TV series because I think that there's huge potential for these 3 shows to work together! This TV Show is my favourite TV Show very very favourite .Infinity favourite ❤LOVE FROM INDIA. #DarkDevilRohit This show just keeps getting worse and worse. I really have to force myself to sit through 90% drama, bad acting and bad writing, just to get some moments of decent "Flash" scenes.
Season 1 was just great and even season 2 was enjoyable. But after that it's become a dramashow with a fast guy in a costume.<br/><br/>The Flash is one of my favorite superheroes but this show is just butchering the character. I love this TV show it s the best TV show U have ever seen since Smallville it's that amazing. People who stop watching it and don;t like it are wrong. Trust me it has great acting and actors and actresses and great ratings and an amazing take on the flash. Grant is amazing so is the others a very great TV shows I hope it goes on for years, He is the best flash and looks just like he does in the comics well he face. I love the TV show from the start. Why have dislikes of the TV show or hates. Iys so good and acting best iv'e seen in a TV show in years.<br/><br/>So epic gets me too think the flash is my favourite superhero of all time. Love the super powers and the other stuff. Hope More and more people like this TV show for years. First of all..kill Iris in the show....she slows it down a lot!!!
Second of all..very immature direction...come-on man..I mean....one day Iris is a journalist and the next day she becomes a scientist who knows everything!!!!
Thirdly... according to the story...Team Flash can do anything! Bary can literally create a Dopleganger during the crisis and escape it...
This show used to be good but now..it's aimless..
Bravo! His acting skills are like someone reading off queue cards in the wrong language from 20 feet away without their glasses. Whoever Cast him should not have a job anymore.<br/><br/>I still give the show 7/10 for continuing to entertain despite Klein's attempts at destroying the audience it has built.<br/><br/>Brooding Angry Klein is far worse than Stupid Virgin Klein. I watched season 1 out of curiosity as it is kind of cult, like Superman. Although adult, I found a certain ´kitch´ charm in it so carried on for fun until the beginning of season 2 when I started to feel like I was wasting my time as too teenage orientated yet too complicated to follow with the story of parallel worlds. As I didn´t watch further, I cannot criticise much. I am just not sure of which the target audience is... This series had a good start for me although with the time it became rather boring and predictible, with nothing in the plot to keep me in the edge of my seat and a poorly written script this was a huge dissapointment for me since I'm a DC fan and I couldn't even finish the last season cause I wasn't able to stand the boredom. Full of clichet. Barry Allen is a teenager who doesn't want you to know. Vilain is just a mess. 
Don't loose your time to see this show. It really doesn't represent The Flash as he would be. Skip this show.
Acting is so bad in there. I'm writing this because I truly believe the flash is the best show I've seen and touched base with so many issues. With all the team pitching in this is a 10/10 and I look forward to seeing a lot more in the future! I don't care about LGBT, I'm in Uganda, so sue me.
I truly loved... no, LOVED this show, until I saw LGBT things splashing across my screen and disgusting me. It was like the wonderful captivating aura around the story just shattered for me and for my friends I used to watch this show with, and that's the last time I followed it. I still grieve to this day, it was my number one show to stream. The disease spread across the DC Universe and I still weep. Oh, just painful for me. This series is amazing and not only for the storyline and the plot but also, the actors. I'm an actor trying to get in the industry and just by watching them act it's inspiring I love Marvel and DC, no doubt if they come up with a B-grade show I will watch that too. Flash is good, at least in the beginning it was so good. But as the story is escalating to new seasons here the content is decreasing. A Superhero cannot be so dumb to create all problems by himself and fight them later involving the life of the city peoples. Grant Gustin is so cute that sometime he overcomes his acting skills with this cuteness. The story has become so obvious that you don't need any spoiler for this show anymore. You know if everything becomes okay then he will again do a mistake and bring up all those villains from somewhere. And the STAR LABS, they are out of the universe man. They can even make a black hole in their lab and even with in few hours, come-on everything about star labs are exaggerated. My full 10 for just the brand flash but for the content I give 6. I hope they will come up with better content. Seriously people fell in love with Grant Gustin more the flash character.
Series needs to slow down or may be stop by now before it starts getting low rated.
However there crossover had major role played for getting positively rated.
A great glitch was the reverse flash showing up again from nowhere even after getting out of existence. Ged rid of the character Iris West and get rid of the mellow drama. Get back to basics; the Flash with all his power against more bizarre and cunning enemies. Having a team to help is great with the side line humour but the Flash should always be the central focus. As we all know the flash , the lovely speedster that capture the hearts of all who watches by being funny and strong .<br/><br/>The series managed to portrait so good that i was bummed that this flash was not the dc movies flash .<br/><br/>But here is what went wrong , too many times the flash screw up and go in back in time and coz more harm then the villains in the series .<br/><br/>Lastly iris west the journalist the was forced down every body throat for no reason ...<br/><br/>S4 is was the boss of every one . Had more ideas about how to deal with scientific problems then the geeks in the series .<br/><br/>Lastly for some reason she was more important then the flash which i find really wrong way to handle a hero series<br/><br/>Thanks The Story Line, Effects and most of the cast are soooo awesome, but Iris ruins most of the moments with her cringe behavior I've read some dissatisfied reviews about flash, but frankly if you watch all the series cross-overs. The whole series makes sense. I love the whole franchise! While, truthfully it may not come close to the actual Barry Allen or Flash from the comics. It does give a new flavored twist, as well as the character build up together with Cisco Ramon and the rest of the characters, you'd come to fall in-love with. Also, not to mention Flash and Super girl's awesome friendship. I couldn't love this show even more. what's left to say? Nice easy going easy to watch kinda program. But don't apply any kind of time line, paradoxically logic to it because this program don't follow any of it. (1/2) I can understand why some people think this show is going downhill. I'm going to start of by saying that I loved seasons 1-4. I loved how in Season 1&2, the storyline plot unfolded naturally. The plot twist in season 1 was juicy enough to keep people interested to watch until the second season. Also, I liked how they focused on character development as in Cisco and Barry learning to work up the urge to ask girls out or how Barry crushed so hard on Iris, however it took them both dating other people to get to each other, Or how Caitlin actually had a husband and she was in love, but she became bitters and "cold", but still remained faithful to the team and loving to her friends. It definitely made the series relatable and all the characters likable.
(Even though, Iris was aloof and it did get a little annoying)
The third and fourth season introduced a new type of storyline: with Barry creating a new timeline and new speedsters such as Godspeed and Savitar joined. I really liked the plot twist with Iris seen being killed by Savitar, however, it was actually Harry Wells dresses as her. Also the new Villain in Season 4, the Thinker. I actually feel that they carried the same storyline with season 1, where Barry is aloof that DeVoe(the thinker) was an ordinary non susceptible old professor with as BEAUTIFUL ðŸ”¥ wife, and not the one behind the explosion of the particle accelerator. ( I love how the wife was also the main villain because it showcased female dominance) It almost mirrors the storyline of Barry believing that Harrison Wells was good but he was actually Eobard Thawne. These two seasons opened the door for the continuous types of storyline plots that we'd see in the next two seasons:meta humans and people able to shape-shift to someone else).
Also new powers and characters are introduced: Caitlin as Killer Frost, Cisco as Vibe, Ralph who becomes Elongated man,Wally West who is Iris brother and Kid Flash etc. I actually like goofy Ralph, he adds the lightheartedness back to the show when it gets dark. The Flash is a fun show, that remembers its purpose is to entertain. I love Team Flash, Cisco and Caitlin are great, and while I was originally shy of Ralph, he has definitely grown into his role. My favourites are Barry and Wells. Tom Cavagnah obviously has lots of fun playing all his different roles. And I'd like to give a big shout out to Iris. She is always supportive of Barry, grows and adapts in her role on the team, can either lead from behind the desk or go out into the field with the faith that Barry will save her. She is afraid a lot, but doesn't let her fear define her. Nora was also an interesting addition, being like Barry in so many ways, having had to grow up without her father, and suddenly being with him, giver her a lot of depth. She does crazy things, but that's part and parcel of being a young speedster who's had a messed up life, and is now time traveling. Joe West and Cecile round out the family, and it's always a joy when they are on the show. The flash show is my favorite show on tv. Ive been watching it since the beginning, now as seasons go on im loosing interest bc at first the show made the flash look good and had detail but now your lacking detail and why is it that you guys say barry is the first speedster and most power fullest one out there but other speedsters on the show is over powering him and new speedsters like wally is more in tune with his powers than barry doesnt make since and u guys need to fix it or you will loose the viewers for it. I was a big fan of Arrow season 1, and to a slightly lesser extent Arrow season 2. I like super hero movies and series, and can suspend disbelief as long as things make sense in the world it is set in. In The Flash it just doesn't.<br/><br/>He can take out 10 bad guys without any of them even realizing he is there. When there are two villains with (bad) gimmick guns, suddenly he has to use a gimmick to defeat them. Why can't he just do to them what he did to the others?<br/><br/>The show has a lot of potential, but I just can't suffer through it to see if it will go somewhere. Are you folks serious with the love story nonsense and the whole gotta do the right thing BS. Ask yourselves what exactly are you writing here, who is your audience? Are you folks brain dead or just assuming that all of your viewers are?!?<br/><br/>I would have preferred to see all of the characters tortured and beaten for all of infinity, would be more appropriate for the level of intelligence they were given.<br/><br/>This would have been more successful as a bad soap opera. Just stop making every episode dramatic. Every episode has exactly the same plot. Iris is totally useless, guiding the team. Giving the obvious advice they already know...Just let her go, please kill her This is the first comic book TV series I have ever watched. and I am not disappointed. The story keeps you guessing what will happen to the show and how will everything turn out. The villain on the show is not your typical villain and it's hard for you to hate the character. The story is beautifully written, week after week.<br/><br/>Grant Gustin couldn't be more perfect to play the title role. He is Barry Allen, he is The Flash. Other characters worth praising is Cisco, Joe and Dr. Wells. All portrayed by great actors.<br/><br/>They add characters to build up the whole Flash experience. It doesn't matter if you read the comic books, just watch the show and it will tell you the story that you need to know. You will be hooked starting from the very first episode and makes you want to watch more.<br/><br/>I hope the show continues to be great! So I am late to the Flash party and am Netflixing the first two seasons right now and just saw Patty Spivot leave. So obviously I looked up if she is coming back and she's not.. that stinks.. She was well, not only attractive, but she was funny and worked well with Barry. With her and Cisco.. the show actually made me laugh out loud during my rides on the commuter trains. Come on.. bring her back! <br/><br/>Anyhow, the show is definitely growing on me. Gave it a 9 stars. I want to like this show but its hard when so much time is focused on Iris who contributes nothing to the show. Instead it feels as they squeeze her in wherever they can or they make a mini plot especially for her that feels so out of place that it forces me to fast forward past any Iris content nowadays.<br/><br/>Barry is the result of lousy screenwriters who either are extremely forgetful or replaced between episodes. One thing is kept throughout the whole show and that is Barrys inability to learn from past experiences. He always has to run head first into whatever he is facing without taking into account what kind of power is he facing. Ofc in every episode he is beaten to almost a pulp. In one episode he is running at the speed of light and then in the next when facing an enemy as slow as a slug he himself slows down to a crawl.<br/><br/>Actually the only consistent feature of this show is Barry always always running head first into snail paced enemies fists knocking himself out.<br/><br/>I'll keep watching but all Iris moments will be skipped and when Barry face off an enemy for the first time ... I'll go and make some coffee while he is knocked unconscious as always. I love the flash and I really do hope that more people start to watch it again and give it a second chance because season 6 is amazing so far definitely the best season since season 3 please just give it another chance people I don't want them to cancel the show for low ratings 2018-19 hasn't been the best of years for the Flash. Viewership has declined and so did my ratings. What else can be better and bigger than Season 5? I have learnt new terms like hack-time! Acting from Team Flash was great. I hope they rest some characters as it is getting too crowded. No need to add forced-romance in the next season.<br/><br/>For Season 6 (S6):
The Once and future Flash was also directed by Cavanagh. He is not only a wonderful actor but one of the best TV directors. If anybody deserves a seat in the director's seat, it's Tom Cavanagh for TV just like Nolan for movies. He finally removed the soap opera drama and fused the entities of previous seasons. The optimistic, pessimistic, and pensive tunes fall at the right places. I wish WB would hire him more often as he understands drama 10x better than other directors. I wish WB would hire Tom Cavanagh as director for S6. In my humble opinion, GodSpeed and The Reverse Flash should be the super-villains for S6.<br/><br/>I hope the writers will push the envelope forward instead of dragging it into a soap opera. See you Flash fans on 8th October 2019!<br/><br/>MyFlash Ratings:
Season 1: 200/23= 8.69;
Season 2: 193/23= 8.23;
Season 3: 188/23= 8.17;
Season 4: 146/23= 6.65;
Season 5: 158/22= 7.18 I really liked the show at first along with my kids, but its only getting worse. Not sure I will continue to watch after season 5 if there's more. The flash is weak and the characters are only getting dumber even though they're one of the "smartest" people in the world. This reminds me of the Walking Dead - main characters making mistakes and illogical decisions a normal human being would not make. So many people complain about the littlest things smh. Yes sometimes it can be a little cheesy but overall it's a very enjoyable show. I really enjoyed season 1, and parts of 2 and 3, but the acting from of the actors really flopped at times. That being said, season 4 was absolutely amazing. The acting by Tom Cavanaugh and Neil Sandilands were excellent and really made season 4. Overall though, I really enjoy this series. Run Flash run! i mean yes there are more TV shows such as: Arrow,Supergirl etc. But this one is simply the best.It has all the drama all the excitement and i loved every single moment of it.And the finales of all the seasons are amazing.The best finale was season 3.I was ready to see Iris die and i wasn't very sad.But to see H.R. take her place was very sad for me because he was such a fun character no matter how many times he did the wrong thing.And his love for coffee was as big as his love for a very special girl.Season 1 was a great starting point and kicked off amazingly.It was a great unexpected season from beginning to end. Season 2 was very fun but how many times Flash doubted himself was a bit annoying.Season 3 was the best turnaround.The season started badly because they kept milking the fact he can time travel.And how many times he was told not to travel trough time,then he knows he shouldn't but still does,is beyond enough.And so i said to myself this season wont be good.And i was very disappointed with what the writers did.But the final 2 episodes saved the season,no matter how bad episodes 1- 21 were.It was all saved by episode #22 and #23.The big turnover with H.R. taking Iris' place was amazing and very well done,i didn't even see it coming and then with flash going to the speed force and Iris losing her husband was a great scene and to top of a very emotional series. Great Show...fun and easy to watch! It is better produced than most movies and all the episodes have the graphics are simply amazing. Nothing is every sloppy or half-assed, it remains accurate to the comics but also has its own original twist to it. The episodes just constantly get better and better and I can't wait to watch the next episode. Great cast, great plot, great everything...This show is for all ages as it has material for both an older crowd and a younger one as well. There is something special about DC comics and their appeal to the moral values and ethics to anyone watching...they make you question what you think you know. Do i have anything bad to say about this show? Hell no, i actually made this account just so i can post this... keep on doing what you're doing because obviously you're doing something right! I am writing this review after watching just the first couple episodes of the show and I have to say I am not impressed. There is tons of potential with the character of the flash that is wasted through this awful acting and useless supporting characters. I mean, I could not make it through the the first episode without cringing at stupid characters like Caitlin and Cisco. Their characters are again ruined by terrible acting. I started this show because I thought that the flash was an interesting character, but DC strikes again! Ruining good characters with shoddy plots and mediocre acting (cough cough Justice league). In conclusion, if you like bad acting and pointless plots, watch this show. This version 2014 The Flash has a lot of actors who were part of the 1997 version of The Flash. Not sure how many actors got to work on both shows. Maybe someone of the writers and production people as well. I find this version of The Flash to be made for fans of the comic book. Nothing like seeing super heroes or in this case "meta humans" come out of the comic book and on to the big TV. There is so much to Love. The writes brought a simple story to TV viewers from a complex story line. Hope to see more meta humans in the next Seasons. The opening trailer of the The Flash 2014 version is getting kind of played out. Seems it could be remade. Then again it might be the characters narration. It seems to lack a deep voice.<br/><br/>Looking forward to the cos play action that comes from the series. The costume department is really working strong to bring a complete experience to the viewers. The Flash started out promising with a Season 1 that followed the old "weekly villain" formula but also carried with it teen-romance because after all, it is the CW. The first season of The Flash was by no means the height of TV but it was an enjoyable show that made every week just a bit better. Season 2 improved on Season 1 in almost every way with a better villain, bigger stakes, more risks, solid motivations and turned its likeable characters into loveable ones. Again, while Season 2 may not have been the height of TV it was definitely the height of this show. Comic books done right. Every episode seemed to get better with no signs of slowing down until Season 3. The clifghanger of Season 2 had been resolved in a less then satisfying way, the loveable characters turned slightly bland, the stories became predictable and while The Flash had always had cheesy dialogue it was more cheesy in the way of Spider-Man 2 not Riverdale. Season 3 went full Riverdale with its dialogue. The villain was predictable, every "twist" the show had to offer at this point was never satisfying and the resolution simply left more to be desired. 
After Season 3 had done away with the greatness of Season 2, many hoped that Season 4 would offer a return to the days that we couldn't wait for the next episode. The writers even tried to shake things up by giving us a Season villain who wasn't a speedster. However Season 4 was definitely the worst of the show. Every character was turned into simply annoying characters. Once likeable, even loveable and now annoying and disliked. Season 4 was the lowest point of the series Season 1 of the flash was one of the BEST seasons of any superhero show, period. It's plot was great with many twists and turns, the editing was quality, the acting was superb and the dialogue between characters was believable (only had a small amount of those smushy, dramatic and "emotional" pep talks). I would give it a solid 8.7/10. Then came season 2. In my opinion, it was also pretty good. The plot was a bit meh but it was made up with more twists and turns and good acting but I thought that they could've done more to build up the other new characters (I.e Wally and Jessie). I'd give it a 7.5/10. Now this is where it all changed. Season 3 was practically the start of when fans started to dislike the show. The way overly done "emotional" sit downs became common for every episode, the villain was pathetic and the plot was just dreadful. I mean, you expect me to be threatened and intimidated by a villain who wanted to be a part of the flash crew to have friends and be liked?! Anyway, I digress. I would give it a 6.2/10 (which is very generous). Now, for season 4 they clearly didn't learn from their mistakes. It was by far the worst season they could possible do! The villain just seemed so...... lame? I mean they spend all this time trying to build him up as some big strong evil villain (and failing miserably) then to have him killed of in an instant. Now im not even going to generalise this season, but I am going to criticise the last episode. IT WAS THE WORST THING EVER! (Also spoilers) So they've built up this villain whose seems unstoppable, having like 15 meta powers and the intelligence to predict the flashs every move. His gf leaves him and decides to be good cus he's too evil blah blah blah then they decide that the only way to kill him is to kill his conscience by going INTO HIS MIND. Now you're probably thinking "oh, devoes got super intelligence, and probably saw this coming. No biggie" but no, he didn't, but imma give him the benefit of the doubt and say he was focused on something else or smthin idk. So the flash goes into his head and, huh, omg, wow that's so crazy. They find Ralph dibney, the super flexible dude that devoe killed and are able to save him, somehow unlike the other metas devoe killed. HOW CONVENIENT! So then they go through this lame battle, fighting like 30 devoes and then eventually kill him. Then you're left thinking "that's it? That was quick" but oh no, devoe ain't done there. He does this weird technological thing and appears alive and moves on to the grand finale. Then you probably think "what's devoe gonna do? Blow up the world? Make every one dumb like he said?" then devoes says "nah mate. Imma just like rain a bunch of meteors over this one city! Haha I'm so super evil!" I think I've exaggerated a bit but it was just so baaaaad. So after all the work devoe has done and all the flash has done they just end it by going in his brain. That's like the film equivalent of "and then he found out it was all a dream..." all this stuff happened just to be contradicted by that. And this all happened before like half the episode! The rest was all mushy and emotional, the worst way to end a season. I'm done. I'm sorry, I can't continue. I'm done. 5.4/10. Imma leave now. THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS<br/><br/>In season 1 I didn't have a show I really like but then Tge Flash came along and instantly captivated me with the characters and story line. The plot twists were fantastic and the writing was on point. Overall that season is 10/10.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Season 2 couldn't keep it that way, it became confusing at points. A prime example of this was the episode "The Reverse Flash Returns" in which they attempted to explain what the heck a time remnant was, something I still have trouble getting my head around, it is also now used for plot convenience. Zoom was a decent villain up until he was unmasked which made him less frightening, plus his backstory sucked, he didn't really have a reason to be a villain. The acting was still good though thankfully, although another downside was Wally he was extremely annoying for many of his episodes. Overall an 8/10.<br/><br/>This trend of declining quality continues in season 3, with a highly disappointing Flashpoint episode. The first half of the season was incredibly boring, the writers pretty much took the characters and made them opposite of who they are. Cisco was depressed and hated Barry for the first half making it really stink. Not to mention Barry was depressed and angsty the entire season. One positive was Killer Frost but even that had issues because why the heck does she have to be evil? Many things were left unexplained. This season also has ANOTHER speedster villain in Savitar the self proclaimed god of speed. He pretty much looked like the live child of Sauron and Megatron. Then the writers decided to wait until the final four episodes to reveal Savitar's identity, and at that point nobody cared. Now some major spoilers begin. The reveal that Barry's time remnant was Savitar was so stupid to be honest, after he was revealed he was seen for five minutes outside of the suit towards the beginning of the following episode. And didn't show up for a bit later. Not to mention HR, the newest Wells, he was extremely annoying and over the top. Then there was WestAllen, something I felt bogged the season down a bit. Tracy Brand now has really no purpose in the show now too so why did they really need to bring her on? Tom Felton though was the best thing in this season, he was great until his character became Caitlin's new love interest. I could go on but overall I give the season a 7/10, the musical episode saved the season from a 6/10.<br/><br/>The show is by all means entertaining but it has a problem that they always try to top the previous season, thus bogging down the entire season. The show is overall an 8/10 I think this show is great, the plot is very well written and all of the spin-offs are very interesting. It was kind of boring for the first few episodes considering all it was was just the Flash chasing down different bad guys, the acting in the beginning was also pretty corny as well. One of my main problems with this show is the amount of breaks that they always take, like seriously?, they have probably taken 3 breaks this whole season and all three of them have been about a month long, like really? I don't really think that a pre-made show needs this many breaks. Since they already have all of the episodes acted out and ready to run on TV they shouldn't need breaks. It really pisses me off because it is really unprofessional. Shows like Gotham and Breaking Bad never did stuff like this. That is the only reason why I can't make up my mind as to whether or not I should keep watching the show. I would recommend to not watch it until the whole season is over that way you don't have to worry about all of these stupid pathetic breaks. This show was great the first couple seasons. Now it is nearly all drama pc/sjw with only "flashes" of good comic story telling with real villainous threats. Nora is a BS character and is a quota hire for the appeasement of the woke crowd who doesn't even watch shows like this, and will never be content with the level of insanity that type of thinking brings.
I gave it a7 strictly due to the first seasons and the occasional greatness the FLASH can bring at times Tom Cavanagh is such a versatile actor. He is brilliant. The first 3 seasons were good, and then this show took a very cheesy, cringe-inducing turn. It's so corny and laughable. At season 5 this show is full on TRASH. I'm only still watching it because Jessica Parker Kennedy (Nora), and Danielle Nicolet (Cecile) are absolutely GORGEOUS. They are literally the only reason that I'm watching this gay reincarnation of 90's era cheesy-ass Power Rangers. Hahaha! I really can't take this show seriously past season 3; Chris Klein is an awful actor. I definitely cannot take him seriously as the main antagonist of season 5, Cicada. So bad! This show has become a prime example of knowing when to leave the game.<br/><br/>The first two seasons were surprisingly entertaining and moving, but with each subsequent season it's become painfully apparent that the writers have no idea what to do with the characters or stories. How many times can the same actors get recycled for alternate universe roles? How many speedsters are really necessary (in spite of what goes on in the comic books)? I've lost count of all of the speedsters running amok throughout the seasons. Det. Joe West, one of the show's better supporting characters with plenty to say and do, has become little more than window-dressing. Cecile, Joe's wife and baby mama, transformed from a no holds barred DA into a pop-eyed Mouseketeer, replete with squeaky voice, and serves only as time-filler---and incredibly boring and awkward time filler scenes at that. And Ralph "Elongated Man" Dibney? He was the nail in the coffin of mediocrity, and signalled the impending downward spiral. Cisco? Relegated to whiney and mopey and jeez, would you get a haircut already? Caitlin wants to be everyone's BFF. Once captivating Iris is now a prim-faced, squinting school marm, and star Barry is down to grimly shaking his head and waffling on in a world-weary voice barely above a whisper about why something is impossible or can't be done or is a bad idea, in spite of years of experience you'd think just might have given him umpteen zillion examples of why "impossible" should be excised from the DC Universe's lexicon.<br/><br/>The villains are even less interesting than ever, and the primary conflicts have devolved into relationship problems.<br/><br/>The Flash started off as a great mix of action and drama, with a dash of humor thrown in, but quickly slipped into apathetic slapstick. My last review for this show which I wrote for this show was very positive now each season is getting worse.<br/><br/>This show now focuses too much and Iris and their so called future daughter then Barry. Back in season 1 when the Flash made his debut to the arrowverse the show was good and Grant Gustin was a perfect fit for the role he still is now but the quality of each season is not very good at all.<br/><br/>I don't see much diversity difference at all from the other CW shows but it is just as bad as CW only forced.<br/><br/>If this show really can't improve at all then please cancel this show and start from scratch once again. As they say if it ain't broke don't fix it but if it is broke do fix it.<br/><br/>I have dropped my rating from 10 to 6 since there are some episodes like the crossover episodes which I did enjoy. Other then that I am pretty much done with this show. The series starts out very good, maybe not of the highest caliber but enjoyable regardless. But as the seasons went by the reuse of the same cast and plot and sometimes extremely predictable episodes swerved this into a steep downfall. In my opinion the show is a good portrayal of the flash, and that's what the show is about.It is addressed to a viewer group from 6 years onward so the show contains a naive plot, naive logic. The budget is pretty low, so the action scenes and special effects are not on top level, but satisfying. The Cast is very small but as the story progresses one start to love them. As far as i am concerned it is better than supergirl, arrow or other dc series. So the series makes great sense on its own way. So watch it if you are able rest your brain for 50 minutes, enjoy without awake the scientist in you and endure some e not so compelling scenes. <br/><br/>PS.It is nearly impossible to write a story(that lasts more than one episode) of the flash( who) without denying the laws of physics, logic and common sense. It is also very very hard to make a villain or antagonist every episode that is as powerful as the flash, because what is as powerful as the fastest man alive besides more faster enemies like reverse flash, zoom(they are already in it, but it would be boring if they were the only villains) or major dc villains like darkside etc.So don't put your expectations to high while watching this show. I'm a huge fan of superheroes, so I may be a little biased in my review of the show, but it is not a terrible show. I will admit that the script can get really cheesy at times which really turns people away from the show the first couple of episodes, but if you can get through that then the rest of the show is pretty decent acting and content wise. The acting isn't so bad either, but Iris is my least favorite on the show and it makes me cringe when she speaks. I like how they use original villains from older story lines, like captain cold, and add a more modern touch to them. All in all it is a decent show and I think you should take the time to watch past the first few episodes if you don't like cheesy acting. As i have known flash from my childhood, i have known him to be a funny guy in the comics and also the animated world. But this flash is not funny at all and always regretting about all his faults. and according to the comics wally west is iris's nephew. i am totally getting confused with the plot that is going on in the series. the vfx sound and animation is realistic and love the way it is shown. there are a lot of things a bit hard to understand and accept in the series. but i would like to congratulate all the crew for putting up such a great show. i believe unlike the movies even batman and justice league TV series should have been made and just not in the movies. in that way they can relate all DC characters to each other and form a well plotted set of how the justice league was formed. for example in smallville the green arrow has a different story and in arrow it's something else. and the flash in the smallville has a different story and the flash present has totally different. there may be change in the characters but there is no definite stories in the actual shows which can be compared with the comics. it's very important to be definite and on the point. the animated movie flashpoint paradox has a totally different texture of the plot based on the flash. so does the other movies. very difficult to relate. yet the movies and the TV series can be a bit on the basic points that they all have the same basic stories which have been going on since decades. i wish Barry Allen of this series be a quiet jolly and comedic character so that it is more enjoyable to watch. You can write about "The Flash" as a comic-book show or a superhero show, but it makes just as much sense to write about it as a Greg Berlanti show.<br/><br/>Mr. Berlanti doesn't get the attention that goes to one-show-at-a-time like Vince Gilligan and Matt Weiner, and he'll probably never turn out a series like "Breaking Bad" or "Mad Men." But he and his company, Berlanti Productions, make a lot of television, and they don't turn out duds. "Everwood," "Dirty Sexy Money," "Eli Stone," "No Ordinary Family," "Brothers & Sisters," the underrated "Golden Boy," "Arrow": in terms of light, dependable mainstream television, that list reflects a high level of quality control.<br/><br/>And "The Flash," beginning on Tuesday night on CW, is a good match for his style. (Mr. Berlanti is an executive producer of the show and a writer of the pilot.) Barry Allen, the man given super speed when he's hit by lightning, has gone through the usual bizarre tragedies in almost 60 years of comic-book life, but he hasn't gotten the attention of a Batman or a Wolverine. You can bring him to the screen without the accumulated angst, and that's what the wholly entertaining pilot for "The Flash" does.<br/><br/>Sure, his father is serving a life sentence for killing his mother. That provides the mandatory long story arc, but the emphasis in the pilot is on the joy that Barry, winningly played by Grant Gustin of "Glee," feels when he streaks through crowds or clogged streets to catch a criminal. (The super speed special effects are a mixed bag — minimal and effective from a distance, hokey in the close-ups.) "The Flash" is notably lighter, brighter and jokier than its companion show on CW, "Arrow," where Barry was introduced in two episodes last season. It's working quickly to achieve a comfort level, and the casting seems to reflect that: Familiar prime-time faces like Jesse L. Martin of "Law & Order" and Tom Cavanagh of "Ed" show up, playing very different father figures for Barry.<br/><br/>Among the fall's three new comic-book shows, "Gotham" and "Constantine" were both bound to go the dark and violent route. "The Flash" goes another way, which might not endear it to the comics fans but could attract an audience just looking for something fun. XD it amazes me how many people are saying "cliché, cliché." yes this show has many clichés but how many shows do YOU watch that don't? Movies have been around for how long people? Shows are GOING to have clichés it's going to happen it's about how well it's executed and altered from the original not to mention the actors are phenomenal (sometimes a bit of overacting), don't get me wrong they don't get a free pass because of that because some movies or shows can get pretty creative and not have ANY at all. But if you're downing a show because of clichés your a moron. Now there are some things that are annoying like why can they still run star labs if they lost everything? why are barry's powers so inconsistent? why is Iris such a pain in the ass? amongst other things but out of all the shows out there this ones definitely got some of the better actors and much better effects then most. My favorite of all criticisms though is these people nitpicking about people telling barry something before he's off. THIS GUY CAN RUN FASTER ACROSS THE WORLD THAN YOU TAKE A WIZZ those 2 seconds mean nothing like at all to a guy like that idk how you consider that a criticism. all and all this shows amazing definitely a must watch for anyone if you don't like it wonderful. But don't think your some big time critic just because you can focus on all that's wrong with a show kk? I look forward to every episode every weeks. Hats off to the cast,crew, writers, producers, and everyone else who makes the shows the best ones out there. I have watched every episode at least 3 times and still watch them till they come back on in January 19th. The one thing that makes the show so fun to watch is that they have put cast members from the 1990's version on this show which makes the show that much better. If you have never watched this show you need to take time and watch it from the beginning and you don't have to be a comic book nerd to have to enjoy it. I have introduced this show to so many people and they have watched it and loved it. Now if you find your self doing this please be prepared to answer questions they have about all the characters on the show. Now if this happens also introduce them to Google lmao This is a great show but could be better especially in the second season. "The Flash" is lucky to crossover with "Arrow" (which is a much better show that i rated 10/10). Here is a dumb scene for example: - The Flash was fighting a meta-human that is made out of "sand" or "molecules" or whatever...and then Joe finds him on the street so he and Patty take him to the Police Department. Detective Joe was in the room questioning him and Barry was outside the room talking to Patty. Couldn't he just tell the Police (as The Flash not Barry) that he recognizes him and that he is not innocent?!?!?! Barry knew what he looked like, couldn't he at least identify him at the Police Department when he was right in front of him?!?!?!?! I hated this whole episode anyways (this was one of the reasons)<br/><br/>Arrow is the best series and is much better than "The Flash"<br/><br/>The only episode i really loved in "The Flash" was the crossover in episode 8 because it was with "Arrow" and a proof that THE GREEN ARROW is stronger, has more experience than THE FLASH is that in the crossovers and Legends Of Tomorrow, Oliver/GREEN ARROW is the one who gives all the orders to everyone. Oliver/GREEN ARROW killed himself in s04e08 of ARROW so that Barry/THE FLASH can save himself, and Barry/THE FLASH was so scared that he traveled through time. Oliver/GREEN ARROW sacrificed himself so that Barry/THE FLASH can get out and stay alive along with the others. But we all know he isn't as manly as Oliver/GREEN ARROW and he hasn't been through 3% of what Oliver has been through. +THE FLASH looks like a d*ckhead in his costume but THE GREEN ARROW looks amazing showing his massive but perfect sized arms arms and body (by Oliver i also mean Stephen) THE GREEN ARROW can send THE FLASH to sleep with one slap, not even a punch hahahahahhhhhahaahhaah But i'll still give you an 8 just because i can't give a 7.5 Bye I'm not a follower, I've seen a couple of episodes on TV from the 1st season and every time I did I got appalled on how terrible it was written. To sum it up: Too lame, too much crying, too less action, plot is incoherent... important scenes don't seem to be taken seriously by actors and above all: WHY, why not hiring someone with at least a glimpse on physics to help on writing?????<br/><br/>For me it all ends when a show clearly fails in staying within the limits THEY OUTLINE regarding their plot. They cheat, this way bad guys never had a chance.<br/><br/>NOTE: I've seen a guy entering a particle accelerator, inside he talks with his friends, all casual clothes, relaxed atmosphere... there he was expected to run at mach 2 to collide with a hydrogen particle and it creates a black hole to travel back in time... OMG!!!! MACH 2???? A PARTICLE???? This is absurd in so many ways i cant explain, is seems it was written by a 4yo who heard expensive words like "particle" and "black hole" somewhere on TV and decided to make a script. WTF??? who the hell reads this and decides to make a show out of it? I think it is a great series and a good adaptation of the comics. If you haven't seen season 1 then don't watch season 2. There a couple of cross over with the arrow and I quite liked the fact that Welles was the bad guy in season 1. I'm hating the suspense they're creating in season 2 though it's really annoying. Firestorm is a great character though especially in season 2. It's a shame Ronnie dies but the fact they've add a second earth with double gangers of everyone, including Welles, totally makes up for that. Also the fact that earth 2 Welles has a daughter in season 2 is really cool. I hope firestorm comes back in season 2. Also I think earth 2 Ronnie is the bad guy (Zoom) Well, the show started off with couple of mediocre episodes, but as the Reverse Flash plot twist built and Barry being "accelerating" (becoming faster and faster every episode) it really got astonishingly great, it deserves a credit when you see the improvement between episode 6 and episode 16 of S1. It has got another plus because of being in the same universe with Green Arrow, Atom, Hawkgirl, Hawkman, Firestorm and now Constantine (yaaay)!Of course it does have some action moments when you really see an opportunity for Barry to use his speed, but generally in fights it's like "Oh no, Cisco, Caitlin, Wells, help me!", it would be nice to see Barry winning a fight without S.T.A.R Labs for a change. S2 is going well(s) by now, really cool storyline with Earth 2, it's keeping us guessing who the Zoom is, just like R.F. in S1, that's the main problem for now in the arrow by me, it kind of feels weird to know who the main villain is and get your protagonist fight him IN s4 EPISODE 1! I like Barry and Patty relationship much, much more than Barry and Iris. The show is great, it's 9 for me because i love Flash everywhere else (not just in TV), but it should at least be a solid 8 for you when you get past first couple of episodes :) This may just be the best show on television. It has everything you could want in this type of show! It's funny, dramatic, interesting, suspenseful and has a certain dynamic between its characters that most shows lack. The characters have depth, they have their own unique personalities and problems, and they all have great chemistry. They also feel like real people, not dark and brooding like batman, not millionaires, but real people who feel, who cry, who laugh and smile. It's hard not to like the actors in this show. Even the villain (spoiler)wells, is like part of the family, you know he's evil, you want to hate him, but you can't! He's just too great of an actor, too amazing of a character to hate despite everything and that's something hard to come by in a TV show. It really makes you want even more of the show just for the dynamic of Barry and Dr. Wells. (End spoiler) Then we have Barry himself, he's not your average hero, he's young, he's plucky and smart, and even though he has been through great tragedy with his mother's murderer, he doesn't let that keep him back, he tries to fix what was done on that night yes, but he also knows somethings can't change and he has to keep moving forward and helping others. Cisco is my personal favourite, funny, nerdy, adorable, and yet so interesting story wise especially with what's been happening to him at the end of season 1 and start of season 2. Let's not forget the actual visual effects of this show! They're breathtaking and even better than some movies. Wide camera shops really give it a unique view when we see the flash and all the powers of the meta humans are in full glorious spectacle without being too over the top. I can never wait for the next episode of this show to premiere, and while the 2 season premieres I must admit were slightly lack-luster, there was that one or 2 mysterious scenes in the both of them that made me have to see what would happen next, then it just kept getting better and better that I couldn't even keep up with the awesomeness! To sum it up, Flash is life! :) i really wanted to dislike this show, and i mean really wanted to. i was like 5 or 6 episodes behind towards the end of the season, and people were starting to say that it was better than arrow. i understood how people were beginning to doubt arrow, as half of season 3 came down to felicity instead of oliver, which really ticked me off, but i still loved arrow, and i didn't like that the flash was giving it a run for its money in its first season. i will say though, before the season finale, i might have given this show a 9 or even an 8.<br/><br/>highlights of the show: <br/><br/>really good plot development after suspicions begin to arise about Harrison Wells being the reverse flash, and making it so that every episode isn't just about Barry fighting some generic criminal meta human.<br/><br/>firestorm storyline that starts with the man in the yellow suit but is actually the main plot line in the nuclear man and fallout.<br/><br/>Leonard Snart/captain cold...great villain and excited to see more of him.<br/><br/>arrow appearances.<br/><br/>late season one hit wonder villains like mark martin and especially mark Hamill as the trickster. some stuff with the trickster was unnecessary, like the subplot that reveals the new trickster was actually his son. i know that when Hamill says "i am your father" they're paying tribute to the star wars movies, and even though i love star wars, it was unnecessary.<br/><br/>low points:<br/><br/>superhero clichés that are in a lot of live action movies/TV, like the ones that have become abundant in the MCU and arrow season 3.<br/><br/>a lot of predictability in the first half of the season.<br/><br/>not delving enough into the part of Barry that distinguishes himself from oliver: the fact that he wants to save everybody and be as heroic as he possibly can. the only time we really see this breakout is in the 2nd to last episode where he tries to save the criminal meta humans.<br/><br/>the fact that all of the meta humans except like 3 were bad people, or just downright evil.<br/><br/>the 2nd to last episode: it started off pretty good, with Barry going to Snart for help and everything, but after that all happens and Barry's plan falls through, it really seemed like they squeezed the second plot of oliver and Ronnie coming in to help Barry defeat Thawne, even if it was only a fight scene.<br/><br/>Snart's sister. she's pointless and annoying, even if she is hot, and i hate the concept of that gold gun.<br/><br/>now i'm going to take a couple of lines to talk about the finale. i always had the feeling that Barry wouldn't go through with the plan to save his mother, but i didn't expect it to happen that way. grant Gustin's acting took things to a whole new level, starting off with the scene in prison with his father, which was very emotional, and with Joe, also emotional, and then finally with his mother dying in his arms, and having to go through her death all over again, especially when he knew could've saved her, and would've if future Barry didn't tell him not to. that scene was incredible, heartbreaking, outstandingly acted, and mind-blowing at the same time. i wouldn't be surprised if a lot of movies couldn't pull that off. and then the way Eddie sacrificed himself to save everybody. i was predicting this since the day that we met Eddie, in the first episode. it had already been announced that reverse flash was the main villain of the first season, and someone with the same last name was in the first episode. yet at that point in the finale, i didn't expect it would happen. but the cinematography involving the shot and seeing Eddie with the blood stain on his chest was so incredible and emotional. and Candice Patton's acting finally came through, and yet another amazing one on one emotional scene was fitted into the episode, and it still wasn't too much. the only thing is, if eddie had made up his mind a couple of hours or even days earlier, he could've just gotten a vasectomy. i will say that i hated the cliffhanger though. i hate cliffhangers. 'I keep the secrets to protect you' and 'I deserve to know so I can help' are a never ending debate which has been constantly repeated in the show. I kind of had enough of that from Arrow.<br/><br/>And everyone in the show is so tempting to be the most moral guy that I kind of hope Wells crashes them all. Lol <br/><br/>Actually I was quite fond of the actor in the beginning, but now he seems way too heroic to me. SO TIERD of Barry's 'it's all my fault' face. And the 'I have to go' face.<br/><br/>The plot does get better after the time dimension's added but, i just don't understand why almost everyone in the show wants to take the full responsibilities and blame everything on themselves. I just want to put it out there that this show is absolutely entertaining..If you like comic book shows then this show will give you everything you want. The show has a great sense of character based humor. And they even get the drama right! Sure.<br/><br/>I liked Grant Gustin as A Flash , He is really good at it..And the Dr. Harrison Wells he was a such an interesting character to watch, I really did love all of his scenes, His voice and dialogue delivering style is really good.Carlos Valdes is really good as Cisco and Caitlin is likable.<br/><br/>Overall Flash is a fun science-fiction drama.I'm excited to see more of this show. I wasn't a real fan of these live action superhero TV shows. It's like they can't quite capture the soul of the people or the powers. So it ends up kind of boring almost like Smallville, more of a soap opera, than a superhero epic. When I first watched this on the CW I was skeptical but then saw that one of my favorite comic writers, Geoff Johns, helped make it. So I started to take it serious I watched it and it showed the soul of the people AND the powers. Also that it takes the comic mythos to the show as well. The guy playing the Flash does a good job both as Barry Allen and the Flash. What some people also don't know about the villains of the Flash. It's that they're pretty human, almost as human as anyone on the hero's side. They just do a life of crime because that's all they know sometimes. Also the people that do Reverse Flash, Captain Cold, Heatwave, Pied Piper, and maybe even the rest of the Rouge's Gallery might be as good as the comics. I also won't tell who the Reverse Flash is because it'll spoil the surprise to it all. Anyway this is pretty good and not too serious and dark as Arrow is considered to be. When I heard from friend that Micheal Scofiled (Wentworth Miller) has appearances in flash I immediately decided to watch it.<br/><br/>I just want to say that this show is absolutely entertaining, and I'm pretty sure that if it was completely focused on going into the science, it would be too drawn out.<br/><br/>It works perfectly how it is, because it's not just about the science aspect of how a man can run that fast. It's a lot more optimistic and cheerful than Arrow and a lot of other shows that are on nowadays. I like how different it is. Love the Daniele Panabaker in it. I hate the part what the f**k Iris is doing in police station and on the crime scenes. because she is daughter of cop she roam in station like some spoiled child<br/><br/>I like the greater part of the performers, and the show is truly meeting up. I'm eager to see where the story line is heading. I likewise cherish how the greater part of the on-screen characters are new faces.<br/><br/>It gives another and energizing viewpoint on the show, on the grounds that as we're finding out about the characters, we are likewise figuring out how great these performers can act, and it consequently makes the show all the more intriguing in light of the fact that the performing artists are so flighty.<br/><br/>I wouldn't say anyone is wrong if they don't like it, because everyone have their choices, but at least give it a chance, because this show is great. The first few episodes were really dull and boring showing out crappy villains, but when (spoiler) we see the true nature of Harrison wells it gets a whole lot interesting! In the middle of the season, the villains get a lot cooler and we'll also find Wentworth Miller (famously known as Micheal Scofield from Prison Break) along with Dominic Purcell(Lincoln Burrows also from Prison Break) go against Barry Allen, Captain Cold (Wentworth) here , is one bad-ass man with a grudge to destroy the Flash. We'll probably get to know more about him in the later seasons. Until here the series was watchable, but not to the extent that I'd go suggesting it to my friends. But it all changed after I watched the 23rd episode !! (season finale) (spoiler) when Barry runs to stop the black hole from sucking the entire world into it! The animations, the story line, the way the entire season gets summed up, This episode was worth it! Hence writing this review.<br/><br/>I do agree that the series has a lot of sci fi in it which people might find difficult to comprehend, but hey, we all loved the avengers didn't we? and the whole point of it being a Science Fiction story is so that it can be out of this world and break the laws of physics. So The Flash is a spin-off from Arrow and is about this guy Barry Allen who can run fast and with the help of some scientist friends becomes the superhero the Flash! I really enjoyed when he first showed up in Arrow season 2 and again I enjoyed watching him here.<br/><br/>Grant Gustin does a great job in his role, his performance was very entertaining during all the comedic, emotional and action scenes; a really good casting choice. Talking of cast, another great role is Tom Cavanagh as Harrison Wells, he was a such an interesting character to watch, I really did love all of his scenes. My favourite character was Cisco though, probably because I related most to him being a geek and I laughed at all his movie references. Joe West was also enjoyable to watch, he was basically the common sense of the show, he gave great advice, he reacted to things the same way any normal person would, he just seemed like a great father-figure and our eyes into this world.<br/><br/>Plot-wise it was mostly your freak-of-the-week deal where they dealt with a new meta-human every week but I enjoyed it anyway, it worked for this kind of premise and allowed the series to show off Barry's various abilities. The overall arc was really engaging too and came to an epic, emotional, and downright entertaining conclusion; one of the best finale's I've seen in a long time.<br/><br/>The special-effects weren't too bad either, you had the odd obvious CGI moment but for the most part, the Flash's running effect, the meta-human's abilities and the final scenes of last episode all looked great.<br/><br/>The Flash really is a fun science-fiction drama; it goes to show that you don't have to make all your heroes depressingly dark and edgy, it can be fun and colourful without crossing over into cheesy (although The Flash did not outrun some cheesy lines). First episode when I watch this TV series, the plot and story quite interesting Barry Allen Job as Forensik Scientist make this movie like CSI or something like that. And when Barry got accident with Particle Acceleration it's seems like another my favorite super hero Spider Man, ordinary people with super power. At episode from 2 up to 15 story feels flat without seasoning plot that is difficult to guess. Like another Super hero they chasing some bad guys and win the battle. When Reverse Flash shows up this TV series more interesting. Have some plot ends with the question of what happens next episodes. And the stories be better and better. and we as spectator have a question what this story will be end, who is Dr. Wells actually. How Barry defeat Reverse Flash ?. I hove next episodes have more dramas and more surprises plot. The less very interesting from this serial story is romance between Barry Allen and Iris west, except at season 1 episode 15. OK just it my opinions about this TV series for superhero fans. Flash is another superhero subject.The regular trend of superheros is followed by the director.Giving suspense is making this TV series very interesting.Barry Allen and his love scenes are similar to the arrow. Character and the actors are very fit to their characters.Flash and his unit trusting the Professor wells and he is the main villain for flash.This sequence is making the series very interesting.The concept which they are using is new and complicated to the usual people like me but they didn't give more priority to the action.That make very interesting.All over flash is interesting and useful way to waste our time. This is my first review for any TV show this TV show in its first season and they are going with very good pace I personally like this TV show because they compiled each and every ingredient or you can say emotions with outstanding graphics like any good Hollywood movie. The guy who played berry Allen is fine actor as flash he is doing a great justice to this TV show. so if you are looking for good science fiction TV show then go for The Flash you will enjoy each and every moment of this TV show. I am big fan of Arrow and I was thinking they cannot make better TV show or as good as Arrow but they proved me wrong this TV show is as good as arrow where arrow on darker side the flash is on lighter side and some time you will get treat to watch both Arrow and The flash sharing a good chemistry. I started watching this show only because of Arrow. Arrow, in my opinion, is the best superhero TV series out there. This, is not. I was mildly entertained throughout the first few episodes, a few plot holes or inconsistencies doesn't dissuade me, I can still like it. Then the last episode came out, #9. The show took a turn for the worse and the inconsistencies became all too apparent and the acting in this one was terrible. Everything was bad. Up to this point I'd give this show a six out of ten for the fact that I don't really care as long as the writing and acting is acceptable. But episode 9 was cringe-worthy and I started doubting my sanity. However, if you like Arrow, I think it's worth trying out and see what's going on and don't take our word for it, because it's certainly worth watching a few episodes. The most stupid show ever! All the episode after first two seasons are just fillers.
They repeat the same thing again and again and it gets so predictable.
Opening starts with "I am berry allen and I am the fastest man alive!" guess what ? every season, there is someone faster than him!
First they create disaster and then try to solve that disaster and in doing so, they get their ass kicked till the last episode. Flash is a very good scientific subject and I also like the sudden changes in every episode that are made but this year the subjects are a bit slow compared previous season and most important where's Nora character. This show was ok, i hated how weak they made flash to be. The story was all over the place, siscos character was not funny at all, i wish the show had a better story line. Supergirl - No
Batwoman- aww HELL NO!
Legends Of Tommorrow - yeah, it's aiight! (get's WAY better as it progresses)
Arrow - Great first 5?6? seasons but declining, but yeah!
Flash - Yes, please!<br/><br/>It's a good show, balances everything pretty well without force feeding you writer/producer's personal agenda.<br/><br/>Iris has part in the series but she gets really annoying. The rest of the cast is pretty enjoyable and played well. It is about the only of the CW Hero5 my family of (3 of each) all enjoy. I have been a huge fan of this show since it started but I have to admit the last couple of the seasons have showed that this how has dipped in quality and this the same this season, it was good but not particularly memorable. The premise of the season sees Barry & Iris's daughter from the future Nora return to present day to help Team Flash stop a serial killer called Cicada. Grant Gustin has become famous for his role as Barry Allen/The Flash and he does a really good job this season. I always feel like he strikes a good balance between drama, humor and action and it makes him a very complete character, He is still a likeable character but he also has depth to him which I feel like some of the DC heroes lack. The supporting cast is a mixed bag, Candice Patton is good as Iris West Allen, she has had a mixed bag over time on the show but I thought her character did a good job and fit her role well. A lot of the drama of the show dealt with her relationship with Nora and mostly it was good stuff. Also Cisco and Caitlin are some of the best supporting characaters in any show. However, there were some weak perfromances this scene, the character of Nora was a mixed bag, I cared about her sometimes, but she was so overused this season and at times really felt like she was the main character and became really overbearing. Tom Cavanagh plays another version of Harrisson Wells and for me this was just one too many, I enjoyed playing the difeerent versions of the character at the beginning but now it has become too much and I didn't really care about him this season. Then we get to the villain Cicada who was easilly the weakest villain so far on the show in my opinion, he was just so boring and dull, his motivation could have been played better by a better actor. The story was interesting, dealing with more time travel then the previous season and I liked the way the show jumped between the present and future and how they affected each other. However, this show suffers from having too many characters on it so it tries to do so much with them but ends up cutting some of the characters short. The script is okay, with some really good drama this season, though I felt this season definitley stepped back from the humour to allow for this serious tone which worked to a certain extent but did take something from the show. The one thing I have always thought is that this show looks great and I stick with that this season, the fight scenes are unique and different every week and the effects hold up to aid in the experience. Overall this is a good season of this show and if you are a fna of the show is still just about a worthy addition to the collection. Ok I think EVERYONE should watch The Flash! Mostly because it has a lot of crazy sci-fi things like: time travel, metahumans, running faster than the speed of sound, the speed force! I mean I would give it 8.3/10. I would give it a 10 if it wasn't for Iris and probably Nora too. Mostly because they're both ANNOYING. Like for instance Nora always says: "Oh my god that is like, so schay!" And for Iris she's always yelling the facility down, and she gives everyone a hard time, but Barry always defends her! And she is also using the term 'schay' now. Anything else? But if you want to watch the show without being constantly irritated by Iris. Well then watch seasons 1 - 4. But 5 is ok! But the main thing I LOVE about The Flash is that it has a lot of genres. Like: Action, Adventure, Comedy,etc. But the thing that makes me laugh is the effects or the CGI of the show! Because the CGI is terrible. Like when future flash went back in time to knock out his past self, so he could trick the rest of the team that future Barry is past Barry, when future flash was fighting his past self his nose was on his forehead! And it didn't even look like The Flash! But I guess if you have nothing else better to do this show is for you! The flash is my fav superhero, and this is the best hands down one of the best, I'll say the sec best. The first best is smallville but the flash is awsome. Keep it going y'all ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯. They keep doing those crossover episodes making me go to watch this horrible show so I can catch up with Supergirl but it's a different show and totally lame ... Currently I'm Watching Season 4, It is the best series in this world. LOVING IT In this show the first three seasons were spectacular, but then in season 4 a pattern was broken. The first three seasons had the antagonist as a speedster. The fourth season had "The Thinker." He was basically a big messed up brainiac. He wasn't a speedster. Then the fifth season I am watching on the CW now. I think the fifth season was better than the fourth. I wish they never made season 4. But overall this series is great. Come on,season five cannot be compared to other seasons make it realistic, you guys are turning this into cartoons. This show is one of the sickest show going, iv watched it from the beginning and i dont think its bad at all, every single season is is great them lot who dis this show are just looking for attention Last aired episode (S4E9) did it for me. Well done writers, you just made me stop watching 1 of my favourite relaxing shows... I didn't expect miracles after watching it from season 1, but latest episode when Barry gets arrested in his own flat for murder he didn't commit was just plain stupid. Why wouldn't he run??? because he saw picture of Iris and him? so what?( Are we supposed to think that he doesn't want to leave her again - NO) He was in the bar with million people all night and used his super speed to go to his flat for 5 seconds so he would have perfect alibi. Just because he 'harassed' thinker before and his body is in Barry's flat he is automatically guilty now? <br/><br/>I know you need a twist in the story, but at least try to make it little bit believable<br/><br/>KIDS COULD WRITE BETTER SCRIPTS THEN THIS, KIDS AND NOT EVEN TEENAGERS!!!<br/><br/>how can you be happy with your own writing like this?? If you just do it for money then please find different job which doesn't require creative thinking as it is clear you don't have passion for writing anymore( if you ever had it) and leave this to someone who cares about what he does... I see a lot of bad comments about this show and I have to say that I don't agree. I really like this show and enjoy watching each episode of it. I think that they're always episodes in a series that are better than the others but it doesn't mean it's a bad series. Of course you have to like the super hero style in general and everybody has different tastes. I'm not saying you should all have the same opinion as me but I think it's worth trying and watching regularly. The characters are great and I even like the bad guys on this show and that's not in my habits. This show made my laugh and cry. When I really appreciate a show, I can exaggerate so sorry if I all bored you but I found that there should also be a positive comment on this terrific show! This series is puzzling to me. It seems to have been written for young teens yet the nature of the content disagrees.<br/><br/>The main character is a difficult, self-absorbed, emotionally infantile, incompetent, meat-head who seems to get by on luck alone. It's almost as if he is the antagonist because he inspires absolutely no empathy. He can't be, however, since the antagonists are portrayed in such a blatantly obvious manner that any doubt vanishes when they are on screen.<br/><br/>The drama that commands large portions of time seems very trivial, especially considering the gravity of the situations the characters face.<br/><br/>The cinematography is not bad.<br/><br/>The specials effects are not bad for a modern mid-budget TV show.<br/><br/>One season and two episodes in and I'm done.<br/><br/>Highly recommended for other people's teenagers, as long as their intelligence is below average, or they're only half-watching while they play with their tablet. I can't get enough of this show. Year after year I look forward to what's gonna happen. I hope this show doesn't end soon. Im all for the flash and when i first found out the pilot was airing i was thrilled to see the outcome. What i found was that the plot is interesting the action scenes are intense and engaging. The show has excellent cgi effects and it is very well written.<br/><br/>However there are downfalls such as the leading character what was they thinking he is awkward an so not the flash material. They need to seriously consider a recasting to a more suited individual who gives of a more superhero suited role and stature. Ill carry on watching but i don't know how long this show will last with the lead character not being suited for the role there have already been complaints on IGN on the lead role guy as well. Overall I like the series. The biggest element I see is all the characters are complete emotional weaklings. Interaction between Iris and Barry is like 12 yr. Old's in grade school. The physics behind THE FLASH are completely impossible and they make NO effort to make any of it work. I understand this complete fantasy but it would be better with more realistic charters and SOME plausible physics involved. I don't normally write reviews, but after watching most of Flash I just felt compelled to write something. Look, all of these shows are fairly ridiculous and require a certain amount of suspension of disbelief which I'm typically just fine with. Having said that, I do actually find the "Arrow" an entertaining show to watch. After finishing the current available seasons I decided to check out the Flash's stand alone show, despite not being very impressed with the Flash characters when they would cross over into Arrow's world. I tried, I really tried. I consider myself more forgiving than most people when it comes to suspension of disbelief, and I try to watch these shows through a squinted less critical eye. The Flash show though... man, the writing on this show really does need some work. It's unfortunate, because there are some decent scenarios and hints of potential but it almost always gets buried under a mountain of cheese. The tonal consistency is all over the place. The rules of the flash universe seem to be quite flexible or constantly changing. I should also say I am not very taken with the actor that has been chosen to play the flash. He is probably my least favorite character on the show, which is not really a good sign. I find his character development pretty confused, which could be blamed on the writing, but it also feels like the actor playing the flash is equally to blame. I found the character of Barry Allen to grow more and more unlikable, which I don't think was completely intentional. And directly referencing the review title, there are just so many situations and scenes that make you roll your eyes or just down right cringe. There is just situation after situation where the actions taken by the characters, particularly the title character are just so ridiculous and so unrealistic. I realize the show is intended to have a more playful and lighthearted tone than the Arrow, but it also feels like some kind of kids romper room show sometimes in which a bunch of spoiled kids solve every situation by the most dangerous and totally illogical methods. It's difficult to enjoy the show when there is so little logic being employed by the characters. <br/><br/>It's difficult for me to sit through an episode of this show without shaking my head or rolling my eyes at it half a dozen times. It's too bad, Flash use to be one of my favorite characters.<br/><br/>I really hope that this is not the actor that is playing flash in any of the DC movies... I really recommend this show. It has been going down hill for quite a bit of time now, but it is still a good show. My favorite TV show, great stories and love the hero's, huge fan, keep it up!!! One thing what I have learnt from these superhero shows is, it is not your superhero which is important but the villain. If the villain character of the series is badass it makes the plot a lot more interesting because then the hero really have an uphill task to beat the his nemesis. And this is what makes a storyline complete, the one which makes the audience to get glued to the show till the very end.<br/><br/>The Flash as most of other viewers response goes, the series since it's inception has nosedived in terms of plot, storyline, character build-up, etc. The series drastically needs a good villain which is ruthless. Someone like Thawne aka Reverse Flash. But even that character the writers have pushed off limits by adding emotional touch. Emotions are good but you need to add a flair in plot which gives strength to the characters and not make them weak. Just like the writers wanted to show that The Flash gets strength from its emotions the same way the villain character should edge out. Like Thanos who is emotionally attached to her daughter but at the same time killed her too for his goal.<br/><br/>Also I feel the writers want every heel character to turn soft by Flash's convincing power and this looks really silly.<br/><br/>There is one more thing which the writers keep on doing is deviating from the main story by adding needless plots in between. Caitlin's father could have been a real badass villain but the writers were so caught up with Cicada that they just somehow made introduction of Thomas Snow aka Icicle look like a fill-in and not a lead role. So they should concentrate on one villain say in one half and other villain in second half which will make the series much more enjoyable and interesting.<br/><br/>Zoom to me was by far the best villain and after that Savitar and Reverse Flash. But DeVoe and Cicada didn't live upto the expectations.<br/><br/>Also one more thing which is really disturbing is that how everyone around The Flash is blessed with Superpowers and which actually killing the show. The show should only concentrate on Flash beating villains altering all odds but the way series is being shown it's making The Flash shown as a really weak superhero who can't do much without the support of his sidekicks.<br/><br/>I hope that the creative team, writers and director of the show will take serious thought into the downfall points and will not repeat the same mistakes they keep on doing. When I first saw the previews of The Flash, I was convinced this show would be terrible because it felt cheesy. The main actor, Grant Gustin, was relatively unknown and so was most of the cast. I didn't watch the show at first until the Arrow Flash crossover episode was about to air which forced me to watch this show. I am so glad I took a chance on this show. First and foremost, Grant Gustin is one of the best castings for a superhero that I have seen- up there with the casting of Chris Evans as Captain America, Christian Bale as Batman, and Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool. Second, the supporting cast are perfect. Love Cisco almost as much as Barry. The first season was so good, I was counting the days to season 2. This season has been great as well. And you know what makes this show so great? The writing and actors. No filler episodes. Each episode has independently been great. The season 2 finale is tonight and quite honestly, just like last year, I am excited. Go Flash and keep up the great work. I try not to include much of my opinions in reviews because I might share a different viewpoint than my reader; however, this show shall be my only exception (until I get hooked on another show). So let's begin: I am an avid comic book fan, meaning that I know all things comic. I also reserve the fact that some people just don't like comics but if you stick with me I promise you that you will have a whole different viewpoint on this show.<br/><br/>When this first show came out most of the cast was pretty much unknown except for Grant Gustin who was a known star on the hit show "Glee". The stars of the show did gain decent fame after the premiere but when the show started gaining momentum the stars were catapulted to fame city. The main stars are Grant Gustin, Candice Patton, Danielle Panabaker, and Carlos Valdes. Every single actor and actress on this show is so talented and so well formulated and the characters in the show cannot be played by better actors. One thing is for sure, these actors definitely earned their stardom.<br/><br/>"Barry Allen wakes up 9 months after he was struck by lightning and discovers that the bolt gave him the power of super speed. With his new team and powers, Barry becomes 'The Flash' and fights crime in Central City." The plot of the show itself is rich. It's like the holy chocolate that only kings eat its so rich. The plot twists and turns like a mountain road and leaves you wanting even more every time the end of the hour strikes. The beginning of the show is the slowest it will ever be, and that is the only bad remark I have about the show. For me, it was around the 7th or 8th episodes that things start getting very, very interesting. Don't worry my faithful reader, I won't spoil anything for you. The show is currently halfway through the second season and its even better than the rest. This show is gaining its tread and it is becoming the show of the century. A lot of people who rated the show poorly have credited thay too the writing and campy story plot of the first 5 epidodes, and I must say I agree.The first episodes of the flash are slow (pun intended) but the overall season and makes up for the slow start and will make you wish the second season would be here in a flash...<br/><br/>Why its so good...<br/><br/>1. Character development, while most hero shows fail to develop the side characters this show makes you care for every role then uses thst throughout the season.<br/><br/>2. Acting , through the first couple epidodes the acting is laughable, but either when they knew they where getting picked up or when they became comfortable with one another they stepped up on their scting chops...<br/><br/>3.The villain , there is only one true villain, the metahumans are training tools don't pay attention to them, the main villain is complex he makes you hate him snd feel for him, he is the ultimate villain while somehow garnering sympathy, you will be pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>4. The relationships... some will make you happy some will make sad , some will be as big as a tidal wave and some will disappear don't be surprised if you are rooting for relationships to fail, don't be surprised if you cry... <br/><br/>5. Speed kills... not pg people die, thats always good for superhero movies. I was a bit worried when I saw the trailers for the Flash. I knew I was going to watch it, because I'm a fan of all things superhero, but out of all the superheroes, Flash interests me the least. He's a superhero who can run away from things. And I watched the pilot episode and it just seemed to be slightly generic. Here's love interest, here's the boyfriend so love interest is harder to get, here's the mentor, here's the father figure and here's the comic relief duo. But it started building on that, adding more depth to these characters (Except for one who I'll get to later) making us care for them and want them to survive, so each time a character gets injured, we feel it with them. I've heard lots of people going "There's no danger to Flash as he's not going to die because he's the title character" but that's not what's important. What's important is who he can save. And this makes it abundantly clear. Of course there are a few bad things to it<br/><br/>Iris. She is the love interest and it can't be more boring. She makes everything about her, even if it doesn't involve her. The world will be getting destroyed and she'll be moaning that Eddie isn't telling her police secrets. If you're going out with a police officer you should know that you're not going to get told everything because it puts you in danger! Eddie also comes across as slightly boring sometimes and I think they could have developed him a bit more. There's a subplot in the back end of the season involving him, Iris and Joe and it basically shows he has no backbone. Which could have been developed slightly with him standing up for himself, but it leads nowhere<br/><br/>In the end, The Flash is a great TV show and a amazing superhero show. If you haven't seen it, I advise you do although some parts may be difficult to get if you don't watch Arrow. I'm giving it 8/10 The Flash series on TV is epic for a lot of reasons and I for one am glad it has continued to remain active on TV. Every episode of each season even through this year has been amazing and very entertaining. Each season has start off a little strange but the more you watch it the more you understand why they went that route and a lot of it reflects the comic books fairly closely in reality. I feel that there are a lot of people complaining because they don't understand what it takes to make movie or TV show therefore they just assumed that if it's not to your liking then it should be rated badly when let's see you make an episode and those are people that's clearly should not be watching the show or TV series in the first place because it deserves at least a seven or higher. I have always been a fan of the flash. It's been a great show until now. This lackluster, disappointing, weak, anger inducing episode has brought me to quit watching this miserable show. The music meister's only motive turned out to make Barry and Iris love each other again. This episode made no sense to me with his intentions, and the ending made me very angry. On comic book.com, they promised that the ending scene would be "One of the most talked about moments in the dc TV universe." Could it be the long overdue Savitar reveal? What else would it be? Oh wait, it's Barry proposing to Iris.... Again. It's something we all saw coming, and the wasted opportunity, catching us off guard would have been an amazing way to set the reveal up. I don't care who Savitar is anymore, this show is a chore with too many filler episodes. I'm done. I hate this show now. It should be canceled. The writers need to be fired and they need to kill half of their characters off in order to make me consider turning it on again. Peace out. The concept is brilliant. The actors are great. The potential of bringing characters from other superhero series is great. The script is pathetic and gets worse with each season. There is no originality in the script at all. The characters are made to be dumb. Its like sci fi soapy. One of the main character does something bad, hides it from everyone, then becomes full of guilt, situation becomes hopeless. One of characters will defy logic and try to bring down the villain on his/her own and will fail. There will be some disconnected distractions. Barry will lose hope again. Then someone will motivate everyone. They will all pledge that there will be no more secrets. This will all be forgotten the moment they leave Star Labs. Eventually Barry will conquer the villain, but it will be due to luck and not his powers or the science or the team work. Rinse, repeat. There some really good script writers out there. Please go hire them. I didn't know much about DC comics but after seeing flash I'm now huge fan of DC comics Look I've been watching this show since the pilot in 2014 and I have to say that Grant Gustin is the best Flash that film and TV has ever had! And I love all the supporting characters including iris, if there is no iris then we couldn't have joe! I love him and his relationship to Barry. Pulls my heart strings, they have had bumps in the road like season 4 but I have come to really like this cast and show! Stop hating and quit watching if u dont like it. I just keep this brief. This show is fantastic for the first three seasons. Season four was flawed but fun. But season five is awful. The writing is so flawed it's almost insulting. It feels like every script was a first draft. Character arcs make no sense, scene continuity doesn't connect, and the characters don't feel realistic. It's extremely lazy. The main villain would have been better suited for a one episode arc. And the main plot of the season, Flash's daughter goes back in time to join the team, is horrendous. You have an actress that's 34 years old, acting like a dumb 14 Year old. She is a CSI specialist for the CCPD in her own time. Yet, they write her like they're writing dialogue for a tween character with daddy issues. Barry and Iris instantly treat her like they've raised her for their whole lives which just is unrealistic. The crossover is the only thing worth watching. First two seasons were so good, they should have just ended it. they have ruined the shows reputation. it has gone so downhill with confusing plots, no suspense and annoying characters. stop watching after two seasons, after that it's not really worth ruining it for yourself. The seasons 1 and 2 were just amazing! But since the third one the showÂ´s quality has decreased. I just finished the fifth season and i think that the people in charge of this show should eliminate the excess of drama that there is in almost every episode! It is annoying and makes the show look like a novel! For example: Iris is always giving a speech to Barry, everytime he does something "wrong".
And also they should make the seasons with less episodes by eliminating the useless and boring filler episodes, focusing more in the main plot. I think that by doing these things, the quality of the show would increase and be great again! Flash is my favorite superhero, i love the show and i hope this show can become again what it was back in the seasons 1 and 2, or better. Honestly this show got me into reading more about the character of The Flash and Barry Allen. But season 5 was kind of a bummer to watch because they just ignored key things from earlier seasons. Nora showing up and living in the past should've been a bigger deal since she's messing with the timeline but they ignore that. Oh also Nora is Whiney and annoying. Also when she disappeared from 2019 because of the new timeline everyone was sad like obviously she couldn't stay forever...she's from the future! Hopefully season 6 is better. I used to like the flash before. Season 1 and Season 2 was somewhat good. The action , The decent lightning effects and Grant Gustin. Although it's somewhat a teenage drama it was still enjoyable. It wasn't until season 3 where the quality decreased. At first they try to make Iris and Barry work making bad romance. And next the villain is intressting but turns out to be dissapointing. And later unsatifying death scenes. It uses the same formula every time. New villain , New episodes with same problem like defeating a new meta human and find more mysteries. Confrontation fail , get stronger , more confrontation , villain kills a character , Barry battles the villain and wins but later puts himself in a new problem. It was ok first time around since they actually made some good scenes and somewhat good twists. But it got worse from both budget and much else. It's boring to see the same actors and actress over and over again and again. It's not fun. Villains have become non intressting and it's too predictable. Flash has become a show now where they're trying to be so equal between genders by doing typical norms to make female characters feel good. Nora was an addition to that and she is just plain annoying. Iris is also in the same area. And grace as Cicada was so bad. Switch up the formula and stop making the same effects with character knocking something over. It's getting annoying. I'm really into this TV series...I here a lot of I'm sorry...and it's not your fault I'm on season 3...Flash is purely idiotic he keeps messing with the time line on going back and try to save his mother....which is making me upset...Flash needs to accept what happens to him but he won't...flash is not the main actor in this series...he is the problem...he can't fix everything Flash needs to let it go...Flash is making me upset about these series...he only thinks about himself...in my perspective he is not the star of the show its Joe...I hate and dislike Flash his most favorite words are I'm sorry all the time...I dislike Flash...everything is his fault...I'm tired of hearing I'm sorry from Flash...he is irresponsible...I don't like his attitude at all...Flash makes everything about him...its about the other actors in my perspective...Flash gets away with everything Flash is the problem of this series....Flash needs to let it go...Flash makes me upset with I'm sorry and it will never happen again...Flash keeps doing it...I hate Flash he is the problem in the Flash TV series I don't usually get into TV shows. There are a few I like and I will watch a few episodes. I haven't finished watching the pilot episode, but I can already tell this is an amazing show. I just found my new favorite show and superhero The Flash. (By the way, my second favorite superhero is Cannonball.) Great casting and writing. Lots of action! Can't ask for much more! 10/10 I haven't seen a sci-fi TV series this good for quite a few years. It's light-hearted and entertaining, yet not too childish. The plot is simple and clear, yet still very gripping. It's a perfect escape from my boring daily life.<br/><br/>The best thing about this show is the script. The writers do an infinitely better job than "Supergirl"'s writers. What's amazing is that The Flash is a spin-off from Arrow, so you may assume it wouldn't be as good as Arrow, but I'm addicted to The Flash even more between the two shows. I really appreciate the good balance between story-telling and humorous comic relief. The writers know how to connect with a geek like me. The CW vampire shows are trying to be dark and mysterious, but in fact artificially sentimental and silly; "Supergirl" is trying to be 100 percent optimistic and positive, but ends up 100 percent lame. "The Flash" is just like Barry Allen himself, comfortable in his own skin.<br/><br/>Though there's one thing I find interesting: Barry is far from perfect. He makes a lot of mistakes. Because Barry made a deal with the Reverse-Flash (in the hope of saving Barry's mother), he unintentionally helped create the circumstances in which Eddie had to sacrifice himself to save Barry and everyone else. Because of this same deal, Barry also unintentionally caused a singularity being formed. While Barry, Stein and Ronnie were trying to stop this singularity from destroying the world, Ronnie sacrificed himself to neutralize the singularity. But the brief existence of that singularity attracted monster Zoom from a parallel world to this world. Then Zoom killed many people until Barry stopped him. Don't get me wrong, Barry really is a hero. His constant care for other people is genuine. Through his countless heroic actions (usually risking his own life), he has saved millions of people; and he has also saved his friends countless times. But he's also flawed; and the mistakes he made cost lives.<br/><br/>Cisco is my favorite among all The Flash characters. I like Cisco so much that I wish they would create a live-action TV series or a movie about him. I mean, of all the superhero TV shows and movies, we have white protagonists, black protagonists and alien protagonists; why do we not have a Latino/Hispanic protagonist? Why? <br/><br/>P.S. It's interesting that people don't seem to find the concept of Barry having sex with his foster sister to be weird. If Alex Danvers (she's lesbian) were sexually attracted to her foster sister Supergirl, many people might be freaked out. So much cheese. Made the same way as the 2002 Spiderman movie, with The Flash dude narrating his own story and that rythmic violin ala Marvel style music in the background, it's been done to death.<br/><br/>The big problem is that the script is really poor, every line seems forced, and it doesn't help that the actors are sub par. More so, the way the story goes is very predictable and of course there's the love interest that he can't tell about his powers and of course she has a boyfriend already and he's seemingly stuck in the friend zone. Let me guess, she's gonna start liking him more when she finds out about his powers.<br/><br/>Skip this one unless you can't get enough of cheese, oh the cheeeesiness.

However as it went it slowly got worse I understand about developing characters but as many have said iris is a terrible character it's true her storylines are boring and a waste of screen time.
Bring back the reverse flash and not just for a cameo or because you needed to fill sometime. I'd kinda like to see more of the multiverse and other versions of the flash that could revive the series a little.
Or do the future flash storyline something like that stop introducing lame villains!
Make it great again get new writers who aren't spoon feeding your fans! So the show is a adaption of dc universes flash
The story is about barry allen who gets superpowers due to him being struck by lightning so in the first season we follow his progress of getting more and more powerful. The show especially season 1 and 2 were very good in my opinion 8,3 out of 10. But after season 2 it takes a bad u turn in season 1 especially they had structure of hiw the show was going to be so the structure was basically new villians every week and that was good snd they also had arcs. They butchered the charecters in the flash especially iris who is known in the comic as barrys wife they try to get her into the show even though she doesn't need to. When I was watching the third season and Barry got sent to the future and saw Zoom kill Iris I got so happy but then when the moment came and it was HR I've never been so angry in my entire life.
After that she has been the most annoying character ever created.
Huge disappointment!
But still the rest of the series is great. Amazing first and second seasons, and that's why I humbly gave the 8 rating, but seriously, this has become terrible! It's unwatchable! There are a couple references to the comics that might be enjoyable for people who like this universe, but boy it sucks You managed to make 2 seasons which was good. Now even actors have gotten worse This series is getting worse and worse. what happened to the costume of flash?<br/><br/>Team Flash can't even see the series dying Season 1 and we're really good but it got worse in 3 and 4 but in season 5 the show went to its peek again.Now all the Crisis stuff is going on and so far season 6 was fantastic Love the Flash, favourite DC character. Grant Gustin is great as the Flash. I decided to give the show a chance because political correctness had to ruin it by playing actors NOT true to their comic book versions. After the fourth season, the Flash isn't as good as it used to be. This show is for ages 7-11 max. Every 5 minutes there is a low-iq drama. This is not a super hero show, it's just a child drama show. *** Best Tv show..I can watch this with my family. No that much nudity and sexual scenes. And the story(Base story) is amazing. Everyone have to use their brains out for understand this time travel pack.....Casting is so good....Music and especially Slow mo scenes are awesome. Vfx is very good for a sci fi series.
I was addicted to this....season 1,2 and 3 are so mich addictive. After that seasons were disappointing. But iam watching it because its a great entertainer.....and expecting some unexpected events. I am sure that they will not spoil the series finale. The visual effects sound are very good also the story is good but very lengthy sometimes watching it i get bored but still i love that show and watch its every episoDe The Flash'' Is without a doubt (in my opinion) one of the greatest TV Shows of ALL TIME. It perfectly blends all he great aspects of A Superhero Show such as mystery,fear,comedy(sometime) & SOMETIMES Has Perfect Plot Twists. How many times in the name of not killing the terrible metas innocent people died? How many times do you have the same enemy's over and over again, it show a lack of imagination. I write this review after emotional flash sends his daughter back to the future and i just though i need to come and say what an arrogant, self pity, whining character Flash is. And in times like this i just remember a real life old woman from Chile who's sun was shot by the police, she said this peace and lets talk propaganda its not something she falls in to. I watch hero series in order to see some justice made in a world i can not bring much justice to and to distract me from all that is going on. But this show as the worst main hero i have ever watched and i watch a lot. Even arrow its better. If it wasn't for all the other characters, most of them pretty amazing i would have stooped in the first episodes. When I started watching this show, I liked it.
The first season was actually decent, the second was okay, the third was becoming bad, the fourth is worse, the fifth is... I don't even know what to say anymore.
The producers' point of view here is probably "Quantity is better than Quality".
The episodes from season since season 2 is very predictable and it has a lot of cliche stuff. My point: THIS SHOW IS A WASTE OF TIME I enjoy a lot watching the Flash. I see here many bad reviews about how slow or swallow it gets. Its a lighter show than Arrow or Daredevil (one of the best I've watched) but it gives me a nice light evening when I watch it and I love Sisko and Caytlin, even the many Wels gives a funny note to the show. I love the Ultimate father figure of Joe, he's made out of fairytales.
I would give one star if I was to vote for IRIS WEST!
She NEVER belonged to the show, her acting is totally BORING and ANNOYING! She doesn't even have ANY kind of expressions!
It took me 3 seasons to get "used" to her and she's really doesn't give anything to the show. Remove her please, make her go for a long trip to anywhere at the multiverse! Will bring fans a lot of joy. The first season was awesome. Second was also really good. Following seasons are good but not quite at the same level. Can't seem to make up their minds about rules/framework so plots get more fantastical and suddenly things that were impossible before are now convenient allowed or the other way around. But overall it's a great show. As many other reviews have mentioned already, the show started amazing with a great plot, complex characters and intriguing dialogue. However, the quality of the show has been going downhill ever since the start of season three.
This TV show was my first introduction to the character and quickly became my most liked one, but with every new episode, my attachment fades away more and more.
I truly hope they can turn this around, but the writers have to step up a ton in order for that to happen. I watched this with my teen daughters since it's hard to find a show that fits younger and older teens- they all loved it! I also thought it was super fun. Iris is getting a lot of undeserved hate. We really like her. Loved her in season 4! The writers' didn't give her enough to do and when they did you can see she's very likeable and beautiful too. Season 3 had a repetitive villain story and that was a bit much, but we loved the angst of true love trying to save the day. The Thinker was a nice change for the villain. Barry/Flash is so likeable. Love Cisco. Caitlin is good, but Killer Frost stuff is so tried and bOring. I don't understand why folks want more of that. I did like the bit with her mum. Just about to start season 5. Excited! The Flash on the CW is a great series with some stories and characters and it captures the feel of the comics really well and each season brings new interesting characters and always a great villain.<br/><br/>My favourite season so far is season 2 I loved everything about that season the villain Zoom was incredible and seeing Jay Garrick was amazing being a fan of the comics.
The stories in season 2 was just incredible and as much as I love the whole series it's never manged to capture that epic feel of the season 2 in my opinion.<br/><br/>Savitar and defoe were also great villains in this series in season's 3 and 4 which also had great stories.<br/><br/>Grant Gustin is just perfect as the Flash he captures the character really well and always plays it to perfection.
I also love the other cast of characters as well.<br/><br/>The highlight of each season for me though is the different versions of Harrison Wells we get with each season it's just amazing and the actor really shows of his talents playing a lot of different characters each time he returns sometimes playing them in scenes together which always fun to see.<br/><br/>The effects in this series are really cool and it's always spectacle when there on screen and always great to watch.<br/><br/>Just a great show and one of my favourites I get excited to see the Flash every week and there's always great twists and turns along the way.<br/><br/>Verdict 9.4/10 one of my personal favourite shows with great characters and stories. The Flash is great viewing experience from week to week. I have been a big fan of "The flash" since i began watching the show. The first 2 seasons were too interesting, but this season has its flaws. I feel its just the story building that they are onto, still i expect the show to keep me hooked up which is not the case in recent episodes. It will be better if the screenplay improves in upcoming episodes. There must be a change in the way the episodes are built or else i don't see the show lasting for long except for kids. Mostly, here in India college students make majority of viewers, so it's going to be difficult to keep the viewership if the plot strays away from what it should be. I used to love the flash but now everything feels so forced. Every single episode is the same. There's a villain, the flash fights but loses, he goes to his friends, gets advice, then defeats the villain. It's like the writers don't even care about the show. Also, season 4 has been the worst. Iris thinks she's the leader of the team? What has she even done for anyone? Then she goes to Barry and tells him "you are not the flash. We are". Iris literally does nothing she is so annoying. I don't understand why the writers didn't kill her off in season 3. They had the perfect chance but of course they couldn't let Iris die. There are many people on the team and Iris does not need to be there. Then she goes and gets powers? Seriously? There are already many speedsters and the show does not need another one. I went to this show to watch the flash. The shows not called 'Iris West and The Flash'. Iris has gotten more and more annoying. I hope the show stops trying to force Iris West into this. I can't watch anymore of this show it's not even like the flash. He is supposed to be super smart but in the show he's just really dumb. I don't know why this show has such high ratings. Wasn't sure at first how the story would go. Didn't know all that much about the Flash character but had some knowledge. Like some of the other reviews, the first 3 or 4 episodes were okay but nothing great. After episode 5 though it really gets good. I hadn't been able to watch it but had them recorded. Watch 5 through 17 in a week or so and was hooked in after each episode. The reverse Flash really gets interesting and I was confused, but in a good, way as to who he really was. It gets explained of course and I am still left shaking my head trying to figure out what happens next. All the actors have improved as the season progresses. Still not too sure about the Iris character. They need to bring back the Arrow. That was probably one of my favorite episodes, and will have to start watching the Arrow soon. Disclaimer: I read a few Flash comics in my youth. Always loved the Barry Allen Flash, so I was pumped in hearing that they chose to use his version instead of Wally or Bart or any of the other speedsters.<br/><br/>That being said, I'm enjoying the hell out of this show. I just now started watching in April '15, and I ended up marathon-viewing all 17 episodes. I love what they're doing! The uber story arc has been mostly predictable for me, knowing the characters/universe well, but it still has little surprises. The actor playing Harrison Wells is delightful, as is the Joe West portrayal. Love love love the way the super- villains are being rolled out -- it's like 1 part Smallville (event responsible for creating the monsters of the week aka super-villains), 1 part Mutant-X (thinktank HQ for the good guys seeking out their own), and 1 part something new and unique.<br/><br/>It's a bit campy, but not as bad as many hero shows. The characters are of good character, even the bad guys. And I can't wait to see more. Full of win! Used to watch the show with my wfie but it has gone to far left.
Constantly references to trump being a Nazi, dog whistles to "punch a nazi" (antifa reference) where nazi means conservative. Supergirl from Nazi works explaining how they, the nazi's are so powerful due to meritocracy. What happened? Did the budget just go through the floor? The CGI has gotten worse over the year's the story has lost all of what it was before. Season 1 was the best and it's just been a downhill spiral from there. I have watched this show from the beginning over the years. First Iris annoyed me. Then the daughter, Nora, made no sense. Being that she is the same age as her mother and father and yet listens to them both like she's all of 6 years old. The only thing that will save this series is a main character being killed. Preferably a West. Do we really need this show? It started off good with a little bit of comedy playing alongside Barry's character and that was refreshing to me because Barry was always an optimistic charismatic type of guy, and by the end of it they thought the proper way to give him character development was to make his life needlessly and annoyingly tragic. Bear in mind when I say poorly written I don't just mean the plot. No I also mean the incredibly cringe worthy way that the characters dialogues are written much less the melodramatic overtones they shove in every time an "emotional scene" is playing out. I get that it's marketed towards teens who think good drama is only good when characters are crying and are mad at each other for reasons that are easily avoidable but just because you have a specific target audience in mind does it have to suck? Look at The Dark Knight for example(redundant overused example I know but bear with me) it was made for comic book lovers, batman fans, and to some degree crime movie fans, but still delivered quality beyond belief. It doesn't have to follow TDK exactly but a little effort would also be nice for a change. Best episode this season. Finally scenes between the original team. We explore the origins of Killer Frost and finally we have answers. Cecil / Raph a good idea to see other duos. And the Cicida investigation continues to advance. Season 1 - Amazing
Season 2 - Amazing
Season 3 - F-cking Amazing
Season 4 - Sh-t
Season 5 so far - sh-t As a 'Smallville', 'Supergirl', 'Legends of Tomorrow', 'Arrow' and 'Gotham' fan I expected a high quality of production from this show and was not disappointed. <br/><br/>What I always thought was lacking from comic-book-Flash was a decent rogues gallery, and they seem to have solved this like 'Smallville' did with their 'meteor-freaks' by having an unlimited amount of super people created in the same lightning/explosion that gave the Flash his powers. <br/><br/>Almost identical to both 'Smallville' and 'Arrow' with the lone hero and his supporting cast, dead parent and many other ways model, this is by far the most enjoyable and coolest version of Flash in ANY medium to date.<br/><br/>Actors and casting is great, SFX above average and lots of fun, easily one of the best live action comic book shows ever!<br/><br/>DC may have lost/be losing the movie war to Marvel, but with all their shows interconnected shows creating such a rich universe I can only see it leaving Marvel in the dust until it can use more than just it's 'street level' heroes.<br/><br/>There is almost nothing not to love about Flash, I am SUPER excited to keep watching the later seasons and the tie ins with the of DC TV shows that are also of very high quality! "My name is Barry Allen and I am the fastest man alive". That introduction speaks for itself, doesn't it? I'm not going to lie; I was a bit sceptical about this show. I wasn't sure what I was getting myself into and I wasn't even sure I was even going to like it. But I am so glad I have been proved wrong. The spin-off to 'Arrow', 'The Flash' is a league of its own and is fast becoming a force to be reckoned with.<br/><br/>When Barry Allen (Grant Gustin) was young, he witnesses his mother's death and his father (John Wesley Shipp) is wrongfully accused for it. Consequently, he is hell-bent on finding out who the real culprit is. Fast-forward fourteen years, he is now a police forensic investigator working alongside his adoptive father Joe West (Jesse L. Martin). He gets struck by lightening caused by the particle accelerator created by S.T.A.R Labs and goes into a nine-month coma. When he wakes up, he discovers he has super human speed and becomes... The Flash.<br/><br/>Well Mr Berlanti, you have done it again. Taking a step back from the brooding Star(ling) City in 'Arrow', we move to a more relaxed Central City. But even so, it doesn't mean everything is all sunshine and flowers. Gustin's performance of Barry is amazing. You sympathise with him and all you want to do is give him a hug. During the show, you definitely see him take on more responsibility as 'The Flash', but at the end of the day... he's still your socially awkward forensic scientist. The comedic moments are filled with Cisco Ramon (Carlos Valdes). His ability to break any tension with movie references or any other comment is brilliant and you can't help but laugh. Tom Cavanagh as Harrison Wells is great and you can never tell whether he's on the good side... or the bad. Jesse L. Martin's portrayal as Joe is great, he's like your big old Papa Bear. Protective of his daughter and a great father-figure to Barry, you will wish that you had a dad like him. Not forgetting the ladies of the show, Danielle Panabaker as Caitlyn Snow and Candice Patton as Iris West are so good and terrific examples of your modern-day women. Both strong and independent, they are perfect role models for younger girls who could watch the show.<br/><br/>It's only two seasons in, but I definitely recommend this show to anyone because, well, it has everything. Drama, comedy and with even a little romance thrown in. This show is for everyone and for every comic book fan out there. So, for anyone who hasn't started binge watching it... what are you waiting for?! I, for one, can't wait for season three! I enjoy this show more than other CW shows especially in Arrowverse. In season 2 finale, they did twist "barry went back in time to save his mother", which made all things the achievements he did pretty much useless. He could have started his own family; even though, he lost his parents. He selfish to do that didn't even think about what it will do to others. No one else had no say in it, he is pretty much controlling the situation. With that been said, season 3 will most likely cover the Flashpoint storyline, which I am looking forward to. Between this show and legends of tomorrow, they need to follow strict timeline rules, instead, they are bending rules for each show. News flash, the custom rule per shows is ruining both shows (pick one and follow it). If you went back in time and change small things, it won't effect much, but changing big things, it should have more effect. The world does not revolve around one city (especially changing something small in one city affect the entire world, just NO). The producers of The Flash are Greg Berlanti, Geoff Johns, Andrew Kreisberg This TV series was produced in 2014 One day when Barry Allen was in his room trying to solve a recent crime incident there was a major storm that came to Central city. So Barry went to close his balcony shutter while closing it with a chain connected to the shutter, all of a sudden while doing that Barry was than electrocuted and was unconscious for 9 months. When Barry woke up after being in a coma he started to notice funny things about his body and weird things have been happening to him and one day Barry was running then all of a sudden hes running fast as a fresh bullet out of a gun barrel. As Barry seen his ability he immediately knew what he could do and what hes always been doing and thats stopping and fighting crime. As Barry continued to keep Central city a safe place to live but then he ran into someone thats just like him and nobody nos what could happen next? while the Flash be able to save Central city from this disaster? or will the Flash fall?<br/><br/>The cinematography is great, everything falls in place the when the intense moments comes its extraordinary because it really gets you in the feel for the moment<br/><br/>Barry's thoughts are to keep him, his family and Central city safe from danger. The theme is achieved because Barry keeps the city safe from the dangers that come to Central city<br/><br/>End conclusion The Flash is an awesome TV series and i watch it every Tuesday. The way the story is set up it brings more passion and entertainment to the film to make the watchers more and more entertainment because of how awesome The Flash is and the story line so I would have to give it a perfect 10/10. I recently watched Daredevil and man,it blew me away.I though of starting with some show along similar lines and with all the rave reviews surrounding it,i thought Flash would be a good point to start.I began watching flash and my first response was..meh...these guys need to learn something from the Daredevil.It wasn't bad was but was remarkably average.Nothing like what i had hoped for.With all the cheesy dialogues and illogical stuff going around, i almost thought of discontinuing the TV show.But i am so glad i didn't, because each episode after the first 8 has been a roller-coaster ride.The acting done by different cast members is immaculate,especially the guy who plays the role of Wells.The show is a great combination of sci-fi,action,humor and romance.The show completely had me hooked.Must watch show for all superhero movie fans!And it has the best finale ever(season 1). When I first thought about watching The Flash's season 1 on Netflix, I imagined a cheesy, childish and Disney-Esq type of show. The first 4 or 5 episodes lived to my expectations, but as the story unfolded, The Flash became a very attractive show.<br/><br/>In the chapters in which he discovers or solves something important, you even end up with your jaw on the floor and your heart beating as fast as the flash. Yes, I have to admit that some lines are really cheesy and it sometimes lacks of logic (I mean, he can dodge a bullet and disarm groups of criminals, but he can't do the same to Captain Frost and his sidekick?), but you end up enjoying it. (Yes, I also hate Iris West, the character who only complains and makes every problem bigger)<br/><br/>I also hated the end of season 1 where (SPOILER ALERT) he finally gets the chance to save his mother and he ends up backing out just because the flash from the future kind of made a sign for him to stop. I mean, we heard you crying every episode because you wanted to save your mother and in the end when you have the chance you just couldn't do it? And it doesn't end there, because thanks to that, he creates doors for meta-humans of other worlds to happily enter to kill him. (That sounds a lot like something Iris "The Problem Maker" West would do) But hey, he needed new problems for season 2 ;).<br/><br/>I'm in the first episodes of season 2 and my best advice for you would be to have an open mind and accept the show's flaws so you can enjoy it and don't judge it for the first episodes (I know they're not really enjoyable). Also some of us who used to love The Flash of the comics end up thanking for some villains and details we used to love from his story. I don't know what people have or haven't seen so hopefully there won't be too many spoilers. So when I was younger I used to watch the Justice League cartoon and Barry Allen/the Flash was a bit of a ladies man. He was always after Wonder Woman, Hawk-girl and plenty of other women. In the TV series The Flash, Barry is quite different. In this series, Barry is a one woman kind of guy. I don't know what other people think of this but my opinion is neutral. They are just two different portrayals of the same character and both are well done. As a side note, I like how The Flash intertwines with Arrow, Supergirl and DC Legends of Tomorrow. I mean they are all from the DC universe so I like the fact that they have combined these series into a sole world and aren't entirely separate series. I like the show and I hope it doesn't become to silly like some TV shows do after a bit. Flash is up to these point a enjoyable, funny and at times strange, in short its a show made for nerds which everyone can past his time funnily, watching it. It really makes the character justice and introduced plots for flash comics practically perfectly. Also the support cast ,which is able to make or brake a series of that type, doesn't disappoint and they try ,despite the danger of superhuman activity, continue their lives as that is possible. That fact ties the series together , because by this point(mid season 2) flash's family and friends have to get used to super-humans running (no pun intended) around. This usually what we see in people ,for example, who lived in areas where earthquakes are common, even when a big one hits ,they stay chill and after it stops , they continue their day to day life. All in all the show is nice ,not over the top and the costume of the Scarlet Speedster looks good, go see it you want. I have tried to make this as spoiler free as possible.<br/><br/>My name is Barry Allen, and I am the fastest man alive - the biggest lie in the TV series. Barry is not the fastest. First it was Reverse Flash, and now it's Zoom.<br/><br/>Going to the review, this show is actually very fun. Grant Gustin as Flash is one of the perfect castings I have ever seen. Danielle Panabaker and Carlos Valdes as Caitlin and Cisco are very good indeed, and Candice Patton as Iris is good. But what I like the best, is Tom Cavanagh as Dr. Harrison Wells, and Jesse L. Martin as Joe.<br/><br/>Flash always has been good, right from Episode 1. Reverse Flash was introduced very soon, and it was really interesting to watch Harrison Wells leading two lives at one - helping Barry and being Reverse Flash. And He, is the best thing about the series - both in season 1 and 2.<br/><br/>The story is pretty good, but the only flaw about the series is that it gets boring sometimes. Like, some episodes are completely irrelevant to the story, and still they exist. But still, the remaining series is a joyful watch.<br/><br/>With the comic relief of Carlos, Flash becomes the family superhero show - something that everyone would enjoy. Other superhero shows, like Daredevil, or even Arrow, are not exactly family shows, but this one is for everyone.<br/><br/>Flash is a great addition to the Arrowverse. There's Carlos' humor, Barry's acting, Wells' charms, and the result is a joyful superhero show, which you can watch with your beloved ones and have fun.<br/><br/>Season 1 - 9/10; Season 2 - 9/10<br/><br/>I would really recommend this show for everyone out there. More a fusnota than a review but I hope it wood help...The best part of this show is that it sticks in a golden/silver age of Barry Allen as the Flash! (If you ask me little better superhero then top Spider-man or Batman). Whole idea is that DC comics in 1960's of Flash was with Barry and very scientific. Actually I don't remember any outer comic that had small texts and real facts from actual science in there printing like that. And TV show manage to get all that plus as much as it's possible to pictures comic on TV! You can see the creators real like those comics and tried to be close to them...Good guys, bad guys, scenes, places...with difference that passed from '60s comics to 21'st century! Good job, fun watch, but watch all episodes or do not at all! The flash has an amazing story its great hands down id give it a 9 unfortunately because when the green arrow meets up with the flash at any point in the whole series I've seen that it doesn't at all sound like what oliver queen would say or do its the complete opposite of oliver queen at any given time in the flash I'm not sure who writes that part but thats the thing stopping the flash from having a 10 is the bad lines between Barry and oliver id have to assume that whoever writes the lines doesn't watch both TV shows because that is a very easily seen difference This could be easily fixed in the future and i hope it does because it is a amazing show but when it gets there to those points where the two amazing shows come together on the flashes side you can just tell but well see if it gets noticed and taken care of So friends and internet told me that The Flash was one of the best series out there. So, I decided to grab my bags of Cheeto's and Netflix the hell out of it. But after the first 3-5 episodes I got a little frustrated. I thought the writing was really bad and childish. The main story-arc wasn't clear yet and a lot of things just weren't making any sense. <br/><br/>HOWEVER. My friends kept telling me to hold on and by episode 10/11 I was hooked. The main storyline turned out brilliant and exciting. The acting and writing really did get better after a while - though it was hard for me to believe it at first. Even the humour gets better with time.<br/><br/>I'm now all caught up with the show and have to say it's a really fun show to watch. Some things still really don't make sense for example:<br/><br/>(SPOILER ALERT) Sisco gets kidnapped by Captain Cold and makes him a cold gun from scratch in 30 minutes. But at the end of season 1 The flash asks Captain Cold to help him because he has the ONE AND ONLY COLD GUN. What!? Why can't Sisco just make 20 more of them in a day or so? (/SPOILER ALERT)<br/><br/>BUT you'll have to accept those little flaws, always remember that it's a comic book universe and just enjoy the main storyline. As the show gets better and better even the little flaws will get better with time. I absolutely hate how the show is making Jay Garrick out to be timid and scared. This is the Golden Age Flash, he deserves some respect. I have not read any spoilers so I don't know the future direction of the show, but give him back his powers. Any fan of The Justice Society should be upset at the writers for what they are doing to the original Flash. He is a hero on his world but lost his courage on this one? He is older and wiser then Barry and the writers should be showcasing that. Also, this show and The Arrow are becoming laughable. Every recurring character has powers or wears a mask. There isn't any secret identities (I know in the comics, Oliver does go public, albeit later in his career). The monologue at the beginning of each show is not needed and somewhat funny. I am happy to finally have my comic book favourites on the big and small screen. If done right it can be great. First thing I wish to say is that yes I am a comic nerd. But that has nothing to do with whether or not this show was good or not. <br/><br/>When i first saw episode 1 i was not overly keen on it. However every episode just seemed to get better and better each time ! What kept this show on air in my opinion was that it was not like Arrow where it had hardly any comedy and just full on action, The Flash was funny every episode and while Barry was not running around fighting crime, he was doing every day things we can all relate to. It has mystery and every episode ( spoiler alert) it has its viewers wanting more clues behind the mystery of Doctor Wells.<br/><br/>If you want a super hero show I recommend this. And if that was not convincing enough listen to this. When the world around me seemed dull and dark and everything started getting depressing, the only thing that kept the happiness in my heart and the light in my eyes was The Flash. <br/><br/>Its full of emotion, twists and comedy. Its like Seinfeld cross Arrow. It simply is not only the best super hero show, but it is the best TV show on air!<br/><br/>If you need a show to keep you wanting more, full of action, comedy, love and mystery look no further!! <br/><br/>Cant wait for more! Please do yourself a favor and watch this show. It isn't perfect, but I do not have a lot to complain about. The acting is surprisingly decent, if not good. I will admit my expectations were not very high after watching other superhero shows like Arrow. However, the acting and writing for this show is solid. The storyline is well thought out and execution is even better.<br/><br/>They subtly worked out small kinks throughout the first season, so I would say that the future looks promising. The only way that I could see the show's ratings drop, is if they unexpectedly kill off one the characters in the next season or bring on a new actor/actress whose acting is not up to par. I agree with David.L that this is a much better version of flash and it has incredible villains who make the story of Flash even exciting. I impatiently wait for its every episode because it has many twists in every episode. If you are a fan of DC characters than this is a must-watch show for you.<br/><br/>Also there is an ongoing show GOTHAM which is also based on DC Comics. Its story is related to the Arrival of Batman in Gotham City.<br/><br/>By the way the point is that The Flash is the best ongoing season of shows and it also has some links with the Arrow of Starling City. You can download this serial on https://kickass.to/ and their subtitles can be downloaded from www.addic7ed.com. I hope you enjoy these serials. I'll admit, in the first few episodes, the show goes just a bit slow, following a "villain of the week" kind of theme. Barry and his team begin the series spending their time hunting meta-humans. But recently, ever since the mid-season finale, the show has really picked up, and began to thoroughly impress me. <br/><br/>The first thing that is truly amazing about this show is the way it stays true to the source material. It is probably the most faithful comic book television adaptation I've seen in years. Sure, there are a few changes that may bother Flash comic book fans (like Barry having brown hair, for example) but they are usually nothing too drastic. The show has been incorporating elements of the comic book with ease ever since the first episode, introducing characters like Clyde Mardon (Marco Mardon's brother) and multiple characters that have served as enemies to the flash over the years. <br/><br/>The acting is pretty spot on, and really gets you to believe in what is happening on your screen. Many joke of the special effects being sub- par, and that could be true, to an extent (although they never bothered me) But keep in mind that this is a CW TV show, and they don't exactly have a large enough budget to do whatever they want special effect wise. <br/><br/>They have also chosen to follow one of the most well-loved Flash story lines for the TV show, which involves Eobard Thawne, A.K.A the Reverse Flash. They have introduced so many other Iconic villains as well, like Captain Cold, Heatwave, Weather Wizard, and soon to be more. They have also introduced so many iconic comic book heroes, such as Ronnie Raymond (A.K.A Firestorm) and Cisco Ramon (A.K.A Vibe). <br/><br/>I will be sticking with The Flash until the very end, for the show has now officially captured my attention. If you stopped after the first few episodes, or haven't bothered to watch the show yet, please! Do your self a favor and catch up on it. You will not regret it. Overall I'd say The Flash is a fairly entertaining show, and most episodes are worth watching. My opinion is not without complaints, however. My favorite character in the show would have to be Dr. Snow. Her character's dialogue is smooth, and she can be funny when appropriate. My least favorite character is Cisco. The writers make him out to be a genius, but when he's not doing scientific work, he doesn't strike me as one. His lines can be extremely cliché and/or cheesy (like when he's giving the meta-humans nicknames), and that can be bothersome. My second least favorite character is Iris. She can be very irritating, humorless, melodramatic, and hypersensitive. It also doesn't help that her actress doesn't play the part very well. I picture her as the social justice warrior of The Flash. "Joe" is a cliché in and of itself (balding good- guy cop with a goatee who's extremely protective of his "baby girl"), but that's not to say I dislike him. I like Barry, but his low self- esteem and poor social skills makes it hard for him to be my favorite. He needs an ego boost, as if being the flash isn't sufficient enough. If you can get past the clichés and cheesy dialogue, it's worth watching. The Flash is a pretty good show. I've also watched Arrow. And I personally prefer The Flash. The plot is good and connected through. Although the explanation about timeline and singularity is not that convincing. But I understand, as the song suggests, "The show must go on". I can totally accept some plausible explanations. I do really like the character Patty Spivot. ("I wish I spelled your name right".) Too bad the playwright decides she should leave. And I looked through the cast list. Based on her position in the cast list, I don't think she will come back. Really like her.<br/><br/>Dr. Harrison Wells(Thawne in season 1) is those kinds of love-able evil character. The part where he does the confession of killing Nora Allen kind of makes him less evil and shows that he might actually care about Barry as he helped him get stronger. Nora is the worst ever character played by the worst actress ever in any superhero TV Series. She is so bad I decided to stop watching. Otherwise I would have given 8 stars but this season with this childish Nora plot is unbearable. This is really a stupid show but if you need one to fall asleep because you have to suspend any brain activity, this one is good. The characters love to say "I promise you (insert fantastical promise here)" and "I'll do everything in my power to (insert ridiculous activity here)". The characters, especially the entire West family, including the Flash, keep on making bad decisions. All the supernatural problems in various realities are caused by the Flash which makes you wonder why he is still the protagonist of the show. However, because of these bad decisions, the show continues on season after season. <br/><br/>This is a good show for kids to watch with their parents. Parents can use this as a learning tool to teach kids on the value of making wise decisions. It's also a good political vehicle on teaching kids that sometimes there are battles/problems that are best left for those involved to deal with instead of wiggling in resulting in a situation of utter destruction and failure. <br/><br/>The purpose of the show it primarily for entertainment. But if the very thin tenuous layer of reason is scratched, lessons can be learnt. This show used to be my favorite super hero show, but it has become so campy. This season is so bad; it's basically the Batman Forever of seasons. west of time ! the writer even don't know what does it mean by common sense . some times there serious event happen and next time in same frame they are talking abut affair. come on have u read the word called human physiology.<br/><br/>i m sorry to my self for wasting my time.<br/><br/>west of time ! the writer even don't know what does it mean by common sense . some times there serious event happen and next time in same frame they are talking abut affair. come on have u read the word called human physiology.<br/><br/>i m sorry to my self for wasting my time.<br/><br/>west of time ! the writer even don't know what does it mean by common sense . some times there serious event happen and next time in same frame they are talking abut affair. come on have u read the word called human physiology.<br/><br/>i m sorry to my self for wasting my time. The flash has the worst premiere ever, and the second episode makes things worse for any viewer. Extremely ridiculous sets of events occur starting from the moment Barry gets struck by lightning, it felt like he was deliberately holding the chains to get struck and then acquire superpowers, also the way that everybody is immediately accepting his new powers with no questioning or even the slightest shred of feeling weird. So the series introduction deserves -5/10 (yeah minus. From episode 03 and go on, It is entertaining, exciting, good fighting scenes and well-made. The fact that STAR LABS are led by 2 young scientists is making the show feels juvenile, as if it broadcasting on Disney or Nickelodeon not CW! Top episodes so far; the crossover, yellow flash appearance, Captain Cold At each and every episode, you get the feeling that the scenario for Flash, Supergirl and Legends are written by a fiverr user. Each episode has this cheesy feeling rubbed on them. Characters always has this "Oh no, don't kill!" Oh no, you lied to me" kinda reactions to every god damn event. All in all, it feels cheap, childish and worthless. But hey, better than nothing. I'll give you that. But please, don't hire talentless actors and scenarists just to make another series. So I really like this show I've seen all of the seasons twice, well made and entertaining. There are only 2 facts about this show that just personally bugs me. 1: Barry's speed is inconsistent as hell. His last tracked speed in the show was in season 2 were he is induced with tachyons and runs 4 times faster than his original speed, so in conclusion at that point he could run up to Mach 13.2. But the season before that he saved "Harrison Wells" (who is really Eobarde Thon) from a lightning bolt and according to the laws of physics and science that lightning bolt is traveling at over Mach 250. You can't outrun that if you can only run slower than Mach 13.2. And there is tons more than just this scenario some are huge differences in terms of speed and some are smaller. My second fact that personally buys me is the same exact solution to all the conflicts they run into. First the person try's to stop whatever they ran to go help with and try to do it. They fail the first time and say they can't do it. The people behind the microphones at star labs give them a pep talk and occasionally say something cheesy. The hero try's again and succeeds and then that whole spiel repeats itself over and over again. Other than those two things the show is super fun to watch, tons of twists like mission impossible so you won't want to know any spoilers. I highly recommend it. 👍 Why are they all soo stupid? Everytime they go 1 step close to something, they my one stupid act or stupid decision, they go 100 steps back. Season 5 is no different than previous seasons. They all are idiots I'm not familiar with the source comics but the overall pace is too slow, the plot is not very interesting and the show as a whole feels very dull even in the infrequent action sequences. I'm a very biased fan, who has been dedicated since season 1. So I choose to ignore most of the mishaps through out the show. But with that being said there are some faults so glaring I can't ignore them. For one- I think Iris has taken too much of a front seat in the show. I want The Flash to go back to its roots, with the show revolving around Barry. It seems like Barry is only on the show to make decisions for people to contradict, as if the fans shouldn't like him. Second- I think a show about the flash would have to be flawed, because a super speedster can defeat anyone in seconds. So it feels that he has to be nerfed at times, and can be easily beaten by a villain who he shouldn't easily lose to. All in all, I will keep watching, and do love the show. This is definitely the best superhero TV show out there at the moment. Season 1 was excellent and did a great, realistic job of establishing the character of Barry and his group of friends. Although the other seasons are not at brilliant as Season 1, I still support the show. I have read other reviews about Season 3, and I have to disagree...I loved how they reveal what is going to happen at the end, and so the whole season is spent on Barry trying to figure out how to stop what is going to happen. It was quite emotional for me, and I have to admit that I cried several times throughout the season, which I totally didn't expect. The musical episode in Season 3 where Barry sings "Runnin' to you" totally got me. I have to say that I'm not such a fan of Season 4, as I don't like the story line of the main villain and the subsequent plots that evolve from Barry trying to fight this guy, but I'm hopeful that it'll pick up. Watch the show, even if you just see Season 1. Barry aka The Flash, is totally likeable and relatable and is a great example of what a good human being is. The Flash was intended to become part of team Arrow, yet it got its own show. And this was the best thing that could happen to the DC universe in the series.<br/><br/>The show is very fun due to great acting, decent CGI and well written main plot, which unfolds step by step, in a meaningful way. Even the pseudo science is catchy because of the funny way it is explained by Cisco, Barry or Caitlin. <br/><br/>The series is based upon the DC universe, but unlike others, it respects most of the comic book stories and background. Yet, the producers have a little touch and twist which will delight even the most die hard comic book fans.<br/><br/>If you are looking for an easy to watch superhero movie, this is the one. It does not require you to have a certain age, but it does make you enjoy 45min of quality entertainment. I was a little bit hesitant about this in the beginning. The Flash has always been in my Top 3 DC characters and I wasn't entirely convinced that The CW could do it justice.<br/><br/>Boy was I wrong!<br/><br/>This, for over half of the season, has been my favourite new show of the 2014/15 season.<br/><br/>Every episode from the beginning just got better and better and would always leave me wanting the next week to hurry up and get here.<br/><br/>The cast is amazing. The three that I always enjoy watching is Grant Gustin, Danielle Panabaker and Carlos Valdes; they are all good to watch on their own but when the three of them work together is always awesome to watch.<br/><br/>The relationships are another thing I love about this show, most notably between Barry and Joe; the friendship between the two and also the father/son moments, especially in the final episode. Another one would have to be Wells and Cisco in particular towards the end of the season, I actually believe that Wells genuinely liked Cisco and regrets the way things had to go.<br/><br/>The range of guest stars and characters throughout the season, including the cast from Arrow, were awesome but Robbie Amell and Victor Garber as Firestorm were the highlight for me.<br/><br/>Another highlight and probably my favourite moments of the whole show; GRODD! Who would think that any show could bring in a telepathic gorilla into a show and not make it look like a joke. I really hope we see a lot more of Grood in Season 2!<br/><br/>My least favourite character would have to be Iris. Just really didn't get into watching the character on the screen but the moment when I disliked her the most was, I think it was episode 21 or 22, when Barry told her Wells killed his mother and her reaction was all about Eddie. I get it, your boyfriend has been kidnapped but your best friend has finally found out who murdered his mother and all she could concentrate on was her boyfriend and Barry's lies.<br/><br/>I love all the DC Comics references throughout the season from Ferris Air, Coast City and Jay Garrick but the awesome thing about these easter eggs is that they don't paint a neon sign towards it saying 'Look here!', it just there for those who know their stuff.<br/><br/>I am EAGERLY looking forward to Season Two! For me, it's too long to wait!<br/><br/>If you're not watching this – GET ON IT!<br/><br/>************************ SEASON TWO *******************************<br/><br/>I absolutely loved the first season so I was eagerly waiting for the new season. While Season Two is awesome, there are starting to be things in the show that I do not like.<br/><br/>Like Barry Allen! Barry had to be the worst character of the whole season, just so much complaining, whining, whinging and pig headedness. Always running off half-cocked, not listening to the team, screws up and then goes running back to them for help.<br/><br/>I really hope Barry improves in Season Three because there were some points throughout the season that he was hard to watch.<br/><br/>Cisco on the other hand; G.O.L.D! By far the best thing about the show and his character got bigger and better this season, still managing to stay the same character and so much more with the addition of his powers. Always on hand to make light of a dark situation without diminishing the importance of the situation.<br/><br/>I really hope Season Three brings a bigger and better storyline for Caitlin rather than her being in love and ultimately getting hurt. Having said that, I did absolutely love seeing Killer Frost – no matter how short it was.<br/><br/>The relationship between Barry and Joe is still as amazingly awesome as it was in Season One, just so heartfelt and pure. I originally was unconvinced of the idea of bringing back Tom Cavanagh full time but that changed throughout the season and worked really well without rehashing anything from the previous season.<br/><br/>This season I found Iris and Wally pretty useless, if they weren't in the show; as far as I'm concerned they wouldn't be missed. I felt that they brought Wally in too early to then just have him floating around in the background, he did get a bit more of a story towards the end of the season but that's when they should have brought him in.<br/><br/>Now onto Zoom. Overall, I have to say I'm pretty disappointed and that has nothing to do with the acting. Teddy Sears was brilliant but I think the writing and the structure of the season let it down.<br/><br/>I started to get sick of the here and there appearances; in one episode and gone for two. Repeat. In my opinion, I don't think we should have seen Zoom until the last episode before mid-season break or the returning episode afterwards. They should have spent the first half with miscellaneous bad guys from Earth 2 with inklings of Zoom, making him more of a menacing figure and then had his story more compacted through the second half of the show.<br/><br/>I still love this show, due to awesome dynamic between the cast, I think it's the best of the DCTV universe so I will 100% be watching Season Three. I really like this show <br/><br/>First of all because I LOVE superheroes, second, because it isn't overly violent and not creepy. I enjoy being able not to watch a dark film. Some people are saying it is a little cliché, but I am kind of liking that. It makes you feel good at the end of an episode when some things get wrapped up. This isn't necessarily a show for younger kids, but it is good for a slightly more mature audience.<br/><br/>***(small spoiler) The Flash grower stronger mentally and physically each show and he is a good role model of a kid trying to figure out his life. If you wanted to watch a superhero series were the speedster kicks all villains ass then then this is the one.most of the times sci fi that tells in the story had been successful.Other than that this series doesn't have anything positive elements to tell.This series also been too simple where most of the time i felt it would had been better if this series had been animated other than making this.The cast of this series is pretty horrible.In every episode we could see the villain kicking heroes ass but eventually the hero will win.i think thats all the script of the series revolving around.the fight between the flash and reverse flash or the flash and zoom will get bored as the episodes goes.The CGI is good.the direction is good.but poor script and bad casting had been the main reason for all the mess.I believe 7 should have been the maximum rating this series should have get. I being a great fan admires this show for its twist & tricks that they used to play in every episodes. Being a hungry fan, I would like to request not to take must time to release the next episodes as it forces me to try something else meanwhile. However need a faster Barry Allen like the comics who quite often use his own new tricks, kicking of everyone's back.<br/><br/>Repeating his tricks lacks example tricks like crossing through walls are very rare. <br/><br/>Make him more confident. More powerful. More Awesome. The best things that runs a show is its plot, which is fantastic in this series. All you need is a better Barry.<br/><br/>Looking forward to the show.Always a thumbs up. Hearing of this new series, I was very interested to see the portrayal the iconic Marvel character of The Flash with modern graphics and storytelling, but mostly I was hoping that the acting/writing/directing would be better than the previous attempted series from the early 90's. While the graphics and technical details of this new Flash series are fair, the script seems sub-standard compared to the other Marvel series (such as Agents of Shield). Consequently, in addition to the rather young main cast, the acting tends to be off-timed, unnatural, and somewhat insincere. In time, with improved writing and a more believable acting direction, these things can improve. However, at least for the moment, it's honestly a rather cumbersome start that makes the experience feel more pubescent than its worth. If you wanted to see a version of flash with an always whining yammering, obtuse flash, an irritating Iris, tons of cringe inducing, awful acting, heaps of inconsistent plot lines, and a bunch of unlikable main characters (except for Cisco) then this is the show for you. Okay here's an analogy. Imagine getting a beautiful meal laid out in front of you and your just about to put your fork to the plate getting ready for a delicious bite of well-done steak, only for the manager of the restaurant to grab the cob from your plate and slam it down your throat causing you immense amounts of pain as you try to force yourself to remain cool and collected and not experience a "food"-boy aneurysm.<br/><br/>I guess the real question here is, Did you see the cob coming? Could you feel the consternation as your corny end neared? Of course you could, everyone could, it's just a matter of whether you'd let yourself believe it.<br/><br/>I really wanted to come on here and rip to my damnedest about the corny nature of the flash, but that's just the idea of the show. It is corny, it is hammy, but it's all in good hope that the majority of superhero fans will see through the poor adaption as they see there favourite superhero hit the small screen. Face it people, it's not that good.<br/><br/>I'm giving the show a 6 because I'm only 3 episodes in. I mean I wasn't a big fan of the first couple episodes of breaking bad, but as I got further and further into the show, I started to like it more and more until I couldn't wait to see the finale. I'll come back and change my rating if the show gets better. Finally they are creating storylines and episode better than any previous seasons.The Flash season 5 was very good and now season 6 until now is fantastic. I must say it's better than the first two seasons which you guys know was amazing It started out pretty good but as skinny boy flash gets big ego his powers suck and it's all about pride and arrogance and selfishness and he's like the super hero who still gets bullied but he won't admit it. Really bad story lines. He cries more than my youngest child that doesn't get a lollipop! Jeez yes it's all his selfish fault that everyone around him suffers and they l say it's not your fault. Well duh it's all his fault. Very disappointed Love the series, really do, but whenever i hear iris talking my brain goes on a shutdown, I can't stand her anymore, i'm out, midst of season 3 Wow!! Where do I start about this show. It is truly one of the best shows on TV right now and hands down the best show of the superhero genre. The first 6-7 episodes were a bit slow and honestly they put me off from the show for a bit but boy did it become amazing once that first 'Arrow' crossover rolled around. This show got me interested into the DC universe and now my friends say that I can write a doctoral thesis on DC. Such is the brilliance of this show. The best thing of this show according to me is that it appeals to all audiences and isn't limited to only those people who have read comics. It splendidly establishes the origin story for Barry Allen and explains each detail extremely well. This show shouldn't be looked at as a superhero show but as a Crime show which happens to have superheroes and super-villains in it. The plot twists on this show are to die for. They are such that they can rival those of Game of thrones, arguably the master of the plot twist.The special effects of this show are also extremely well done and each VFX sequence seems fluid and not at all clunky. This is very commendable considering that this show runs on a TV budget which is significantly lesser than the budget for a movie. This show is must watch for comic book fans and is well worth a try for regular TV watchers. It has got the full potential to be the best show on TV within the next few years. OK, I'm sorry, but what in hell happened in the most recent episode (air Date: 5/12/15)???? I watch Arrow as well as The Flash and in Arrow, "Oliver Queen" gives his life up to be "heir to the demon" or Rash Al' Gul. Basically saying that he is NO LONGER OLIVER QUEEN. Yet in the recent episode of The Flash, Oliver leaves Nanda Par Bat and helps Barry. It doesn't make sense to me that he can go and help Barry out in CC when he almost killed his best friends and convinced them that Oliver Queen is dead. ( I have seen the trailer for the season finale for Arrow, but still) I just don't see how they could that after the last 2 episodes of Arrow have been so "counter-Oliver" I absolutely love this show it is epically amazing I do hope that they get another more known villain and up the fighting next season like they did in season 1 2 and 3. Season 6 villain wasn't really that big of a deal and I kind of sucked that barry didn't have a lot of his power I hope they kind of go back to what it was great at in the first four seasons Keep elongated man he is good actor. Flash is great iris sucks. Oh yeah it's straight Don't change to suit Batwoman please. That show suck badly.
I like The Flash and miss DC ledgends.
Stop doing crossover episodes. 52 years ago (give or take a few months) I was given issue #1 of Marvels Iron Man & was hooked forevermore on comics & the characters within & soon after I discovered the comics from DC & was hooked again & so growing up it was exiting whenever a movie or TV show was developed about these characters, sadly over the past couple of decades these shows & movies are more inclined to be directed towards teenagers & they even seem to be written by teenagers, proof that these movie & TV execs while desperate to show "inclusion" & "diversity" within these projects they don't give a thought to it for the viewership, as with this show, yet more proof that the DC execs regard money as more important than their catalogue of characters, which of course is to be expected, but at least demand that CW are faithful to the character & develope story's that are worth the viewers attention, each and every season its just teen drama with a sprinkling of superhero action, it's drab & repetitive.
Season after season "I'm not fast enough" "gotta be faster" tears & more tears throughout episodes that are more ridiculous as the seasons progress.
Too many main cast characters vieing for screen time and character development and too much teen angst from characters that are supposed to be adults.
Thank god for Tom cavanagh & the characters he plays, he is the "diamond in the rough" of a show that all but trash.
I for one am just gobsmacked at how this show has declined from season to season, in each season the endless killings mixed in with comedy & "woe is me" overacting.
There is no cohesion to any of this, is there anybody steering this boat or is there just too many involved in this show, which would explain why season after season is repetitive nonsense.
Do better people, show the flash as a hero crime fighter & dump this team flash nonsense, give us crime fighting stories & flush the garbage, super hero's don't have time for "teen angst romance" they're trying to save lives & thwart villains for crying out loud First off, I really enjoy this show. It is basically my Saturday cartoons. The characters are well written and I love the use of Tom Cavanagh playing multiple character.
Each character has their own place in Team Flash and they've got very unique personalities. The big cringey problem I have with this show is that: Barry Allen does not have a tactical brain.
He feigns strategic leadership but if he had proper training from- I don't know the Green Arrow or his cop adopted dad/father-in-law- He could be more successful as a savior of his city. I get that he's got a big heart and I get that the show is teaching the viewer an important lesson through The Flash but it would be nice to see him evolve from a sensitive, down to earth hero with little tactical skill to someone of the same cloth but with better training. The first 3 seasons were good ,but after my worst season(4) , the season 5 was also disappointing but it's back on track after 15 episodes. Very good movie show.. Especially reverse flash character in the initial phase was splendid.......... I really wanted to like this show, but it is so blatantly predictable that it would almost be funny if it didn't come off as so serious. The characters are about as one-lane as they come and almost every line of dialogue is exaggerated and over explained. The bits of nuance that emerge periodically, in both the characters and the plot lines, are interesting in theory, but the characters' subtle hints at what's going on are more like slaps in the face. While entertaining at times, this show could have been much better with a bit more subtlety and authenticity. I must be honest, I like the flash. I like all characters and the recurrent storyline (which you often have with hero series), does not bother me so much.<br/><br/>I'm not a big fan of the crossover episodes and they lost me a bit on the several earths, but still manage to enjoy watching the the show. This show was great, S1&S2 were great not a bad thing to say at all about them. S3 I loved it but not as good as the first two seasons but all over I enjoyed it the only thing I didn't like was that the death of "that character" was shown to early and had to drag the season. S4 is awful I watched up till the mid season and just stopped, I'm not a fan of Ralph at all. I know it's a tv show and budget isn't high but the CGI in this season(S4) is so bad it's actually ridiculous - as previous seasons had better CGI than that crap in s4. I watched a couple episodes of S5 as the promos looked promising but the new suit is horribly bad like really bad what did they do??? I know they want it comic accurate but this makes Grants body appearance look bad and he's getting a lot of hate on social media, I can't continue to watch it's just not the same anymore. This show was really great and enjoyable till s4 came along and killed it. Amazing show you never want to stop watching. Even my kids enjoy this show very much Does not matter how old you are or how mature you are to understand stupid things won't affect children's mind because they never analyse what they are seeing which being shown to them.
Because for those immature children's only thing matters is entertainment...You fool them , they don't care , they just enjoy it.
Seems like whole the series of WB made for children's only and not for adults who understand what are actual things happens in the world...There are N number of encounters where you will feel like smashing your head on the wall and throw your TV or Mobile or iPad just by realizing how much stupid you are for watching this.
But just for heck of entertainment if you don't know how to spend time just like I did watching whole 4 seasons in 3 weeks time then you are there...Just go for it.
I guess similar thing happens with Supergirl, Arrow and Legends..Just to understand cross over episodes you need to be in each episode sync with other 3 TV shows..
Cheers guys. It's a fun watch. I must say- I didn't know much about the Flash universe outside of video games but it's a fun lazy watch when you've got nothing else to watch. No major complaints, but I'm not overwhelmed either. I might be biased- I'm a major superhero series fan. The Flash has always been an enjoyable watch for me, especially with the first couple of seasons being fantastic. However, this show has fallen in its quality but I did still enjoy season 4, but improvements need to be made for next season. The premise of the season sees Team Flash attempt to rescue Barry Allen from the Speed Force to take down The Thinker. Grant Gustin plays Barry Allen/The Flash and he is still great in the role, he is a very likeable character but he really had to do a good job with the drama being given to him and he excels in this role. The supporting cast is large this season and definitely a mixed bag, Carlos Valdez/Vibe is easily one of the highlights of the show, he is such a positive character and I really enjoy the life that he brings to the show. Tom Cavanaugh is back as Harry Wells form Earth 2 and he has a really good arc for the season, I love the fact that his character is so different from the other versions of the character he has played. Credit has to go to Neil Sandilands who plays Clifford Devoe/The Thinker, he does a great job as a different type of villain this season, though I do wish he had more screen time as in the middle of the season he isn't as involved as I wanted. Unfortunately there was some negatives, this was the season where Candice Patton as Iris West became incredibly annoying and similar to Felicity in season 3 of Arrow. She was just annoying to watch and I hated the writing of the character to at times try and make her more important then Barry. I still like Danielle Panabaker as Caitlin Snow/Killer Frost but her character was also written pretty poorly and I didn't like her character's growth this season. This season introduced the character of Ralph Dibny played by Hartley Sawyer and I really didn't like his performance. It was overly cheesy and messy as his character's tone changes from episode to episode and he just felt like an annoying distraction this season. The story of this season is interesting as you see this interesting villain and how The Flash and the team have to deal with him, especially with some ways they deal with this. However, this season attempts so much that it can be hard to track what exactly has been achieved throughout the season. Also I felt that this was the weakest season when it came to emotional stakes, and I felt that this season didn't really provide the emotional consequences that previous seasons have. The script was actually really good this season, the humour was there as you would expect from this show. But the actors did a good job in selling the drama, even though I didn't really care much for I can't deny that at times it did really worked. The style of the show is quite grand this season, it tries new unique action scenes that at times do really work. However, I feel like at times the CGI looked a bit cheap and didn't deliver as much as previous seasons have. Overall this season was the weakest yet but is definitely worth a watch if you are a fan of this show. I love the series, great cast, great stories, but the actor playing Leonard Snark, puts on this really irritating whiney voice. It is so contrived and does not fit in with any other character portrayal. Even though the show at times struggles with clunky dialogue and plot sequences, it is good so much of the time and the characters are lovable. The biggest draw is Barry Allen himself, who carries just about every scene he's in. Grant is so amazing, being a great actor, charismatic, and capable of being a goody-two-shoes without making you want to punch him in the face (which I find to be rare). <br/><br/>The later seasons have more issues but there are still some gold moments. This is a great show! The writing is amazing and the casting was excellent. Its defiantly one to binge watch, and one that will keep you entertained. The start of the title was amazing but with time it just got less interesting and boring. Either the story needs some immediate uplift or views might not be the same. The level thrill and suspense during zoom was amazing.... so with the new villan the suspense should increase but instead the episodes are getting more of less fun. I'm in my 40s, and a bit of a TV/movie snob, and I love the writing on this show! There's often a twist, the actors are quite good, and the stories are fun! It's cool to get a different Harry (with the same Tom Cavanagh) each season (brilliant). Jesse L. Martin is just as nice to look at here as he was in LAW & ORDER. I could eat Carlos Valdes right up, and all the other actors are, again, both good actors and nice eye candy. :-) Seriously, truly, with the Helbing brothers and the rest of the production and writing team, this show seems to be in good hands (which makes me feel like I am, too). I'm just so sick of how they rely so heavily on time travel for this show. Is there nothing else they can do? Well, actually, yes. If you took away every time travel-related episode of all the seasons of this show, you might have a watchable, one-season, six-episode series.<br/><br/>Otherwise, it's just drivel, as Joe himself basically admitted in one brief scene when questioned about the contradictions and repercussions of Nora's visit from the future and its ensuing chaos. For the most part, time travel can only work well for one or maybe a couple of episodes of a series, or for self-contained movies, as was done in "Star Trek," "Looper," "Predestination," and others, but in a series, the paradoxes just mount up too quickly for any explanation to leave the viewer with anything more than a sense of "WTF?" "This includes the original "LOT," which I don't bother with for this exact reason. "Timeless" is the only series that I have ever seen that did a capable job with the issue: no bull about different timelines, creating multiverses, etc., ad nauseum.<br/><br/>I just don't know if I can take another season of this disaster from its king-of-the-comics-on-TV, Greg Berlanti, who is likewise slowly ruining his other DC shows, albeit in a different manner. On the others, he is mostly just providing such poor oversight for the writers that they repeatedly indulge in ridiculous leaps of logic or sense. Which is not to say that this doesn't happen on this program. Take this example: on the recent Episode 21, there was a climactic battle between Team Flash and Reverse Flash. Reverse starts running toward them, maybe seventy feet away. He is going so fast, that neither Flash nor Nora can react. But somehow, Cisco has the time, and reflexes, to throw his hand out, and create a 'vibe' to some other place, which Reverse doesn't have the time to avoid!!<br/><br/>If you want to read other, discriminating opinions on the show, read the reviews with a six star or lower rating. The others are probably from people who spend less time thinking about the show than they did as adolescents when they gushed over the latest month's edition with their friends. Just cause this show is based on a comic should be no excuse for treating its audience as a bunch of brainless teens. This is season 6 review.
In season 6 Nora Allen became a member and the team became musymusy and the team think became weak.more than half of people are happy that Nora got erased from existence.she was too annoying. The TV show i am watching is called ' The Flash'. In my opinion this show is really interesting, the pilot episode is probably the best one I have ever seen. Some pilots in other TV shows were not as interesting as this one. Episode 2 was even better, but that's in my opinion, Main person in the show is Barry Allen, terrific actor. There are more main characters than Barry Allen himself, but in my opinion he is the MAIN MAIN character. Iris ( his "sister" in the show) also (detective Joe West) is another main character. His role in this show is to be a father and also an excellent actor. 1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111 It just doesn't have that special thing that makes something special. Plus it's like everybody is a speedster now. The show could be called The Flashes. When you're saturated with super heros nobody is a super hero. It sorta makes Barry just another character in difficult to watch show. <br/><br/>It's not story driven, it's not character driven it's just driven by those of us who read the comic books and enjoy watching our beloved heros come to life which, more often than not, disappoints. Me: it's impossible to get progressively worse
Barry Allen: hold my beer.<br/><br/>S1: 8/10
S2: 8/10
S3: 6/10
S4: 5/10
S5: 3/10
S6:? Do the math. Season one was really good, Season two and three weren't that bad but Season four was totally poor. Zesty may be a word you would usually associate with food. Something with a lot of flavour and maybe a little spice. Well for me that definition really fits The Flash. <br/><br/>There's a hell of a lot to like here. This series has real pace, it frenetic, just like its hero. There are moments of introspection but this sits alongside round after round of really well crafted action scenes which are kept interesting by an abundance of genuinely novel plot twists and turns. <br/><br/>Combine this with some really decent acting and a dash of spice in the form of a love triangle and some pretty out there villains and you have a real winner in this series. <br/><br/>Eight out of ten from me. I've watched 3 seasons and I've had enough. Here' what's bothering me:
1. Barry Allen is a scientist. Educated and smart... at least the story says so. In reality he's just incredibly stupid. He can't do anything by himself. In combat he doesn't use his speed, he just runs around like an idiot.
2. Physics. It seems that the writers have absolutely no knowledge about it. Friction, force, kinetic energy, acceleration.... OMG that is primary school knowledge.<br/><br/>Barry runs at mach 2 speeds in combat, he can outrun a lighning (one episode shows that) but his punches have no power and he gets hit by slow moving enemies. Seriously? If that wasn't enough he's a crybaby. Grant Gustin-Barry Allen Very Weak Actor Seems like a kid in most of his character all most weak like he is Not all grown up . What I find amazing is he is still has hope for a girl who clearly just likes him. He has a feminine personally yet most women I know are stronger. I just don't care for a hero's not able to Man up or woman up he is just lame. On another note I love the Idea of the flash and his comic book style of reality. Plot is interesting but some of this goes to far into a lesson plan or something. The rest of the actors fit well.I guess what I really like about the flash Is the team work .Yet there is a fly in the ointment You will just have to watch to find out what it is ! What the hell with the dagger of the fifth season, it's the thing with the most exaggerated superpowers. Just finished the 5th season. A nice tear jerker at the happy ending. Looking forward to season 6. Thank you to everyone (actors, actresses & production crew) for the entertainment.! You have to applaud DC to inter mingle Flash Arrow Supergirl etc in storylines that's one way to try and increase audiences for failing storylines and scripts!!
However that is the only applause I can offer as these shows are all failing in delivering a good storyline individually and are rapidly finding themselves falling into the cancelled series category ,which to be honest would do us all a favour My husband and I watch this every night after work. It's a great show, suspenseful and funny, we fell in love with every Character and the love story with Barry and Iris. He's hella fast he's hella fast, goddamn he's hella fast Modern Power rangers...stupid story line..all have power..paralel universe, paralel heroes..it could be nice, but storyline is like some kid wrote it I initially liked this series, because I was hoping for something different. The acting isn't bad. Its not great, but its not bad. Direction and Cinematics from DC are always above par. However:<br/><br/>-1: Depth of Characters : One aspect in which Marvel is supremely ahead of DC is character development. Some exists, but most DC hero's ( In their tv series) have similar personalities. A large part of this lack is due to the pace of the show being too fast ( excuse the pun). When you rush the plot, you don't get time to develop the characters.<br/><br/>-1: World Development: I don't feel invested in the world DC are painting in the show. I have no real connection to Central City, and I don't really care what happens to its citizens.<br/><br/>Doing a thought experiment I thought to myself, for every 100 people who developed super powers, how many would realistically end up being evil or would be willing to kill people for money/power etc. The answer would probably be, not many. I would think that many more would use their powers for either good, or would try to live normal lives. I know this is a fantasy world, but I just picture 200 people in super hero costumes standing around waiting for 1 bad guy to pop up and so they can all stop him. <br/><br/>-3: Formulated plot lines: This is the main one which ruined the Flash for me. Each episode follows this formula, which has been the same for DC since the 80s.
1. Episode starts, hero is doing normal person thing. ie, working, dating, family outing etc. or something of comical value. 
2. Bad guy comes, hero fights them and loses to bad guys ability/technology
3. Hero develops new skills/technology or gets an ally or some advice
4. Hero defeats bad guy
rinse repeat. <br/><br/>In all honesty Marvel ( and even Fox Xmen ) are lightyears ahead of DC in terms of almost everything you judge a series on. Even Iron Fist has more depth, is better written and is more watchable than The Flash. I may not keep a big sentences but the Flash is coolll Flash is my favorite superhero. I find the show very refreshing. Love the best dialogues i love season 3 the best episode is 9. Good enough stories a fun superhero series. Barry keep it up buddy.Flash is my favorite superhero. I find the show very refreshing. Love the best dialogues i love season 3 the best episode is 9. Good enough stories a fun superhero series. Barry keep it up buddy. Personally, I thought that this episode of The Flash was good, but not at its best. <br/><br/>I liked how they brought Barry back, because if they didn't, I would have been very disappointed. But, then again, they would never get rid of him! You can't have The Flash without the flash! But, the beard was definitely not a good look on him, that's for sure. I am still quite confused on what Barry was writing, and I think it must mean something. <br/><br/>I loved that Caitlyn is back! I have to admit, she is one of my favorite characters on the show, as Caitlyn Snow or Killer Frost. I feel bad for her, because her third love, Julian, has moved back to England. Also, I can see that her powers are trying to take over again, but there is something stopping them, and I'm sure that will come up later in season 4. Danielle Panabaker, who plays Caitlyn, stated that both Killer Frost fans and Caitlyn Snow fans will be happy with season 4.<br/><br/>I'm really not sure why Iris was running the show at the beginning, because she knows nothing about the science. I don't know what happened to her, because why wouldn't she want the love of her life back? Maybe she just accepted the fact that Barry was gone. <br/><br/>At the end, we saw The Flash's season 4 villain: Clifford DeVoe, a.k.a. The Thinker. I knew that he was coming ever since season 3 episode 18, Abra Kadabra. Abra Kadabra said to flash, "Here it is: in the future, you and I have been enemies for years. There have been others, of course. Thawn, Zoom, DeVoe..." So, I did some research, and found out who he was. I am curious to see where they are going to go with this, as this is the first villain in The Flash who is not a speedster.<br/><br/>So, overall, I would recommend watching this episode. I rate it 8/10. I enjoyed Flash the first 3 seasons.However I am hoping few changes that seems to be repetitive and kind of annoying in all episodes. First, Iris has to shut her mouth or die rather than telling some dialogues like 'You can do it Barry' or 'I am sorry Barry' every episode. Whenever something bad is happening to the world or some super villains killing people, flash, Joe west or iris do not seem to care about the people at all. These three keep telling to each other,' I just want you to be safe..blah blah' seems to be repetitive. They should show some genuine concern to the people.<br/><br/>Other than this, Flash is definitely enjoyable.. the efforts spend to put a show together and make it live is high and i respect that...but this show is full of crap story line, if you show people as intelligent in the show then, they have to be intelligent which means the obvious has to be known, but this show portrays people as intelligent but they do 80% stupid stuff. better not watch it if you want to see something logical. This is a mix of 90% Dexter and 10% The Arrow, and it is pretty obvious. Flash is totally a meaningless show, but you know, people watch because it is a based on comic which people love and it doesn't matter until you get profit out of it. The Flash TV show is like a child being born for a billionaire, show quality is not necessary for publicity About the flash, creators are doing it all wrong. Please read.<br/><br/>In the last episode, Eddy Thawne killed himself, erasing reverse flash from existence.<br/><br/>So this means no murder of barry's mom in past,and no flash till the particle accelerator from future (1st future, before timeline was disturbed) explodes.<br/><br/>So no blackhole would be created in central city, as in the last episode.<br/><br/>How can he have powers by then(2015), if particle accelerator has not exploded.<br/><br/>I know creators might wanna do the 'parallel universe' thing through black hole. No reverse flash, means no opening of portal in 2015.<br/><br/>Until you show justice league in parallel universe, has opened the black hole to get the flash. But its just barry allen, not the flash. He just cant go run into the black hole.<br/><br/>I hope my post gets to the creators of the Flash and I get a reply soon. Thanks for reading<br/><br/>-Shubham Sabharwal The show is riddled with plot holes, but that's ok. The cast is so endearing you overlook things. What you can't overlook is the horses already dead being beaten more and more. This season was supposed to be lighter and gunner like the beginning... it hasn't been. The season long arcs are killing the enjoyment of his show. So many episodic shows are drowning in the bed for season long arcs. Just stop. Six is fine for Devoe, the Thinker. Multiple arcs per season would service this, and other shows, better. The main arcs are dragging to the point of monotony. Go with three arcs per season... or... just what is required to tell the story. Three or four maybe. Twenty odd episodes with the same villain harkens back to Super Friends... and not in a good way. I used to have this rated an 8, as it was fun. I've dropped it due to boredom with arcs that are way too long. There are plenty of villains in the DC catalog. PLEASE! awful, after catching other meta humans Flash preaches them good and they won't listen to him, this happens every time, completely bored by the repetition, he neither completely eliminates them nor cure them , completely lost the plot and Caitlin has one expression, i couldn't really understand whether she is laughing or crying. Barry Allen even he is terrible actor and utter nuisance when he does few things, worries for non-sense.<br/><br/>Horrible, right from start of season2 Well, I want to say my opinion, was nice from first season after some point in season 3 I was a little bored with the whole thing backwards and forwards ... its nice that at some point The Flash took finally the girl, but guys about that, why the two actors is so cold with each other and this is happening and with Arrow and Felecity, guys just become more carefree more loosen up.. hope the director to improve the communication with each at next 5th season with Flash and at 7th(hope to be 7th) with Arrow... Cause if love don't exist why we fighting for?!!! I watch this show only because it is nice change to see Candice Patton in role of Iris. I think her acting is good,her face expression and voice are really relaxing change on TV shows and I believe she only needs a little bit of improvement when her character survives tragic events. That can make her a top actress of all time. Candice is only positive what I can say about this.<br/><br/>Negatives: first- Flash should need more superpowers if his costume has holes like this. Else he IS dead, and all we see is his last flashes in his head before he died... He needs Superman skin and tissue to survive,or covered face to survive his own speed... Second- when Eddie died-that should be end not only of Reversed Flash- that should be same end like in the end of season 2-his mother was never killed, he always lived with them. Yeah, they tried to invent "fixed" points but be born ,or not, is fixed point...BTW I find time travel theories made up,like this story, because there are always some out of context explanation,but that is another story. Third-I find really funny how people around FLash are so slow in mind- he is too very slow. I couldn't stop laugh how many times Iris didn't find out who is Flash, also Patty had a lot of time to figure out, his "brother", his boss... Come on ,man run out before you and he came in other clothes form other side, and you are so stupid to not recognize him? Also,I can't believe how many villains get into Star-lab and how they don't have any measures to prevent attacks? Flash can't prevent anyone to shoot innocents from 3 meters range, but he can stop bullets when Joe tried to shoot "Reverse Flash" double? Guy shot him by slowest gun in history-gun making ice-and Flash didn't move? OK, I know this is show for teens, but really guys... You didn't invent his physical limits in story,only he needs to eat several times more than earlier... There is only one good written character-Joe... Come on... When it started i loved it so much (especially Grant Gustin because his character is so cute like Barry Allen) because found it interesting especially about his mother. But in the fifth season, after having enjoyed the first 4 seasons, Nora is so immature, bad with Iris and so irritating. AND THE FACT THAT SHE KEPT VISITING THAWNE EVEN SE KNEW THAT HE KILLLED HER GRANDMA? i loved Barrys reaction that he abandoned her in the future when he learned that Nora is betraytor and i think that the actor Grant Gustin is the BEST choice (not like Ezra Miller in the movie Justice League and the Flash movie that will be premiered in 2022). After that, i hated the fact that everyone thought that what he did was wrong (abandon her in the futute), because not only he was right that Nora cant be trusted, but it would be better to watch Nora from baby, not suddenly as an adult. Also, Nora is being mean with Iris but i think she was a good mother even if she lied, because without Barry maybe she didnt know how to handle the powers of her daughter..SO NORA CANT COMPLAIN ABOUT HER MOTHER BUT ABOUT HER CHILDISH BEHAVIOUR! I was looking forward for Iris pregnancy but now that Nora is an adult and IMMATURE IRRITATING CHILDISH is not satisfying. However I enjoy watching it. You csn watch it but it begins to get low season by season. Being an avid comic fan, I was incredibly excited when this show was first announced and came out. And it did live up to its hype in the first three seasons. The third was the best by far with all the physical, mental and emotional conflicts it provided. It felt not only like a good comic book tv show, but a good tv show on general. The next season, with the Thinker brought the whole show to what felt like a standstill. The idea behind it seemed somewhat feasible but the way it was executed still made it feel like a grueling chore. There was a lot of romantic elements thrown in, weird relationships that popped out of nowhere. With Cicada this for even worse. The introduction of Nora was completely unneeded and she became by far the worst character of the show, and I'm not trying to undermine the actor in anyway, just the way the character was written and her role in the arrowverse. The only thing that there is to even look forward to is the crossover events, they are by far some of the best episodes. I'm looking forward to the crisis on infinite earths event but the way the shows are going on, I don't have a lot of high hopes. The comic book fan in me however still hopes that it'll turn out to be good but that's just me holding on to loose strings. This is a great show. DC evolve his character very well. I never read comics, so have no pre-existing bias against the show. I can watch it with an open mind for pure enjoyment. From the beginning have enjoyed the plot and science twists and character development. Just like all superheros, the Flash has flaws and learns more about himself through the choices he makes. Refreshing to have a millenial hero figure to show to my 8-year-old as an example of values and choices. Far better than the anti-hero figures in the media and on tv these days. Overall really enjoying this series and am up to season 3. The Flash is awesome! With only one season down it's proved it is a force to be reckoned with! It's got an amazing cast, incredible stories, visual effects, acting, cinematography. Season 1 is in my honest opinion the BEST LIVE ACTION SUPER HERO ADAPTATION EVER!<br/><br/>The whole Reverse Flash Story is perfectly executed, with plot twists and turns thrown at you nearly every episode. It was hard to see what would happen next! It just kept getting better and better.<br/><br/>Needless to say The Flash is the definitive superhero ride. It's going to be tough for season 2 to match season 1 or even exceed it, but Arrow Season 2 did it, so why can't the Flash.<br/><br/>The first season was so good I almost cried when it came to a end. (I'm not a baby when it comes to a TV show or movie) I would recommend this show to all of my friends, 10 out of 10!<br/><br/>Grant Gustin is an amazing actor and other actors too.<br/><br/>I really can't wait for the next episode. The title for a TV series is flash, the genre of TV series is a science-fiction. The country of origin is American. the original language is English. the number of seasons is four , the number of episodes is ninety-two . Is the fastest main in the world, he works at star lab and is a young scientist working for the central city police . Is eleven years old , he saw her mother be killed by a mysterious thing, his father was accused , and he serves a sentence for a crime which he did not commit. Barry Allen affected by the explosion of a particle accelerator in Harrison well's laboratory, making of him an exceptional person capable of running at extreme speeds. I just finished second season and it is much more fun and catchy than first one. I realized that all that silliness I was complaining about is there on purpose. They wanted to make counterweight to dark and gloomy Arrow, so they took lighter and bit silly approach, but it is very well written and done. It's not my cup of tea, cause I'm more into Arrow atmosphere, but I have to raise my rating from 6 to at least 7.<br/><br/>7/10 This is a great action series. That helped me understand how come English majors can produce such valuable science. Well, not as valuable as Star Trek produced by a military grunt with a taste to harass anything he perceived as a woman.<br/><br/>Super heroes are for one side of the religious crowd which perceives itself as too refined to preach the holy book at the street corner. Jesus walked on water? So does Flash! And the reason might be even more idiotic than in the case of Jesus. And it is science because it involves electrical power, nonsensical math functions on a transparent whiteboard. As long as they shout it loud enough. Of course. A century ago these people were saving the souls of their fellow country men, not women. Today they save the Earth for every living person and even those irrational, hysterical, sex-obsessed women.<br/><br/>Contact me with Questions, Comments or Suggestions ryitfork @ bitmail.ch Flash is one of those shows I came across randomly on TV and it got me really into the whole "superhero universe". I decided to watch the few episodes and the more I did, the more I liked it, but I also started noticing way too many flaws in this show that sometime made me not want to watch the show. I admit, I didn't have any hopes about the show, but it is 'decent' enough to be entertaining to all audiences.<br/><br/>The whole show is revolving around Barry Allen (The Flash) and his struggle with his new super power (The speed). We get a new meta human villain every new episode while also introducing new super heroes (from the comics) every now and then to enhance the experience of viewers who read the comics.<br/><br/>Now, without revealing too much, I'm giving this show a 6/10, only because this show never fails to make a mistake (nearly every episode). I've been through all 3 seasons of the show now and I've seen so many flaws that made me wanna stop watching the episode several times over (but I didn't... because in a way, I like the show). From hideous cgi to poor writing and acting fails, the whole story can sometime seem vague and not very intriguing. Nonetheless, the show is entertaining, I'm giving it that much. If you do not care much for details and if you like the super hero genre, I guarantee that you will enjoy this show more than I do. I enjoy this show as a spin off from The Arrow. I find the characters fun, for the most part, and Barry Allen engaging and believable - I like his sense of humor. I was so excited to see Tom Cavannah - he has been a favorite of mine for a long time and he doesn't disappoint. I do wish the writers of the two shows would try to make the main female characters less annoying. They constantly put the heroes and their loved ones in danger because they refuse to listen. They don't get what they want and whine about it. I find them selfish and frequently grating. The women in The Arrow and The Flash are interchangeable which is an indication of lazy writing in my mind. I do like Felicity though at least in the early seasons. The Flash doesn't rely so heavily on flash backs which I appreciate. I don't watch this expecting intellectually stimulating dialog - and I don't get it but it is good escapism. My only request and this is what had me get tired of The Arrow and while it is a little thing - for the love of all that is holy - stop asking "are you OK". All the time they are doing this. If you are trying to make the show a drinking game, your audience would be wasted half way through. Stop it! It isn't quite as bad as The Arrow for this annoying little tic, but annoying enough. All that being said, if you want escapism and predictability The Flash is worth a visit. There have been so many reviews against the writing and the acting of the cast. But after you see a few episodes you just get attached to them especially the main cast as most of the story revolves around them. There are some annoying moments but and they don't hurt a lot if you are glued to the story. It is interesting to see how the Flash evolves as a character based on the events that happen around him. Grant (flash)and Tom (Dr.Wells)have been my favorite characters so far after 2 seasons. The second season has ended with a good twist and it will be interesting to watch what will happen next as it will change the entire future of the Flash. Cant say that it is the best show but its good enough to get your attention after a couple of episodes. Looking forward for Season 3. I knew very little about 'the Flash' as a superhero except that he went fast. I saw this and thought I might get half an hour of some cheesy stuff to watch, but instead I got a very great show.<br/><br/>The people who act int his are pretty great, nobody I want to ignore constantly and Grant does a great job at being The Flash. Sidekicks are although average, the show clearly makes up for it with making Barry a cool dude you'd want to hang out with or travel at lightpeed with.<br/><br/>Good enough villains that it makes the show seem interesting enough to keep me watching.<br/><br/>If you are hit or miss on watching this like I was, give it 3 episodes and you are very likely to keep watching. This show really is fun. Sometimes the acting seems a little over the top or a little lacking but its never bad. Grant Gustin is amazing and as the show progresses so does his acting. It gets to the point where you feel all his emotions because he portrays them so well. The show hits every emotional beat, its light hearted & fun, then it has its sad moments but the show does have its darker toned episodes. Like I said there is some cheesy moments in the show but I forgive that. None of the episodes are bad, some are definitely better than others but when this show does good it soars. I stayed invested during the whole first season and Im in the process of watching the 2nd season. I like this show a lot as far as super hero shows go its one of my favorites. If you like comic book shows and want something more light hearted than say arrow or daredevil or Jessica Jones, then you should give this a try I have to say I didn't expect this show to be as fun and entertaining as it is. the acting is mostly realistic. I can actually imagine people acting like the characters in real life situations, and the writing is brilliant. Unlike other shows, even though every episode has it's own plot, there is always a development towards the endgame. This show is a very good example on how to do a super hero show. Grant Gustin gives a reliable performance as a deep character we learn to sympathize with and at times get mad at. we get to see him grow and evolve as a super hero but also as a human being. other characters also show development as the show goes on and the outcome is an addicting, fast paced in a good way,funny show that really keeps you curious while waiting for the next episode. i want to ask that why he didn't ran behind Reverse Flash after her mother death and why Dr.Wells have died besides he was able to see the future ? some questions :<br/><br/>1 why people cant see him while he was getting coffee or pizza or anything? <br/><br/>2 why that S.T.A.R. Lab is still working after the particle acceleration?<br/><br/>3 if Cisco have build those meta-human cells with Dr.Wells then why Wells doesn't knows the runaway from that cell?<br/><br/>4 how Dr.Wells ,Caitlin , Cisco and Barry knows everything about Science or machines ?<br/><br/>5 why Barry chose not to change the past and stick to the present ? The Flash is one of the greatest shows the CW has to offer even though its just wrapped its first season.This show should be in the forefront of the CW and could hopefully end up being a supernatural-Esq show.Although The Flash is a great show, The writing and VFX sometimes take a dip in quality, particularly during some of the "inspirational" moments of the show. The VFX department clearly spent a large portion of the budget was spent on Grodd. While Grood looks amazing and a real achievement for VFX on Television, some of the other VFX shots through season 1 look like they were made with Microsoft paint.That's a minor complaint and does not take away from the overall the experience. The Writing is spot on in most episodes such as episodes 15, 23 ,20 and 9.<br/><br/>Particularly one of the shows great strengths is its "Rouges" gallery, including the rouges, Captian Cold. Heatwave, Weather Wizard, Pied piper, Grodd, Reverse-Flash, and of course the great mark Hamill reprising his role as the trickster. Wentworth Miller as Capitan cold is just as good if not a better Villain than the Reverse-Flash. The Villains are the strength of the show. <br/><br/>(MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD BE WARNED)<br/><br/>The twist with Harrison wells (Tom Cavanagh) as the man in the yellow suit (reverse-flash) is probably one of the strongest plot points in a TV show to date. You never see it coming. Being a DC fanatic really made this show really enjoyable and exciting to see how they includes major parts of the flash lore throughout the series such as the flash saving his mother, the appearance of Jay Garrick's hat in the finale, I will be direct here. This is a fine show, I like the actors, story is promising, sci-fi is great. One thing which I didn't feel good about was some cheesy lines here and there which decreased the value of the scene. If you like Arrow than I think this show is perfect time pass for you.<br/><br/>If you are expecting something totally new than you might get disappointed. But I think it's better to watch one or two episodes to make an opinion about it. And another thing that I felt good about this show is its positive vibes.<br/><br/>Best Watch for : Teenagers. How stupid and idiotic are You Fans? Because You can't have Barry Allen aka: The Flash/The Scarlett Speedster without His lovely brilliant Wife/Investigative Reporter Iris West-Allen! So again You so-called Fans who keep saying kill off Iris well if that ever happens then You'll be killing The Flash Television Series/Television Show on the CW Network. YES this is the second Series/Show as part from the Arrowverse, but it's the Heart & Soul of the Arrowverse especially The Flash being the Paragon of Love/Caring! NO SPOILERS just stating a Fact also the Truth!!! I remember watching season 1 and I loved it. Season 2 was fantastic with good plots but things go downhill after the season. Season 3 was mediocre, few episodes like the crossovers were fantastic and entertaining to watch. But overall a major disappointment. Season 4 just became boring, 1st half of the season was fine and I thought it was getting better. But the 2nds half just sucked, the finale was actual terrible. Season 5 was absolute garbage. I watched the 1st episode but just immediately stopped watching after 20 min. I hated how the season focused on nora, every scene was about nora. I returned to season 6 with an open mind and it was better. It started getting better. The plot starts to become better every episode and I hope the flash will improve.<br/><br/>Cgi and plot<br/><br/>This is a tv show so I cant really blame the cgi because of the low budget compared to movies but the plot should be better executed. This serie is very amazing ! The name of the show is Flash , it's a science-fiction serie because in real life they are no superhero. In this plot the main character is Barry Allen he is Flash the superhero, its power is to move at a supersonic speed and he will become a vigilante. I say no more or I spoil you. This serie is really easy to look at and understand. I can't wait for season 6 to come out !!!!
Even if it has quite a series of this kind it still remains great to watch. It Gets Worse Every Season The First and Second season Was Good So I Will Give 5 Star The first two seasons of the flash were so good. It was fun, had great main villains, great fights. With good acting, characters and storytelling.<br/><br/>Season 1 offered us Eobard Thawne a man from the future who designed himself as Harrison Wells. This season gives many questions and mysteries. It offers Wells who helps Barry get stronger and faster. Barry starts to look up to him. Just to be betrayed, in a great rivalry.<br/><br/>Season 2 introduces the multiverse, which opens up so many stories todo. It gives us Zoom a very creepy and terrifying villain. Also gives us Earth 2 Wells, Jessie Quick and Wally West. With more villains like king shark, and killer frost. Season also gives a great cliffhanger with Barry saving his mother.<br/><br/>Season 3 and on it wasn't as good, season 3 was alright with Savitar. But Savitar was not ass good or intriguing villain as Reverse flash or Zoom. Same goes for the Thinker and cicada. The writhing and quality also goes down. Making Iris leader of team flash, making too much drama just to do it. It's just not as fun as it used to be, villains are boring and drug out. It's just sad with how good the first two seasons were. I got through the first season and enjoyed Barry Allen et. al. But as I reflected on the season, I realized that sometimes the enemies could stop him, and other times they couldn't. This began to irk me, as The Flash is so fast that he could outpace every enemy except for a very, very few, such as Zoom. It was the inconsistent writing that left me deciding not to continue watching, despite the positive elements of the show. With so many other people, and there are so very many others, having the ability of super speed. It just doesn't make The Flash special anymore. Just like on The Arrow, everyone and their dog has a bow and arrow or is some kind d of super hero.<br/><br/>It's time to move on.<br/><br/>I hope Batwoman doesn't suck. I can't handle 32 bat people running around Gotham.
. I don't know what happen day by day the flash getting bored.
During season 1,2,3 it's was like wow sometime it also gave goosebumps
But now I don't know what to say.
But still ♥ I love to see THE FALSH episodes I cuz of the flash I've been able to know so many things about time so please its a request to team flash plzz bring some information regarding time & space & let berry fastest man alive
Thank you This is a great show for the sci-if buff! The storylines are SO well written. I am in love with the diverse cast- Cisco (Hispanic) aka, the brains of the outfit: and the inter-racial relationships - Barry raised by Joe; Barry married to Iris; Wally and Jessie. I binge watched 3 seasons and bought the 4th and there isn't much that appeals to me on TV these days. This show appeals to my mom, my niece- the whole family. The acting is FANTASTIC! I will keep watching til there aren't anymore to watch!! Based on one of the coolest Superhero's in comics The Flash truly embraces the rich mythology of the comics its based on.The show blends drama ,humor and science fiction.The main character Barry Allen is played beautifully by Grant Gustin is a nerdy guy who isn't your traditional male protagonist.All the side characters are great and as you can tell this is my favorite show currently on air.If your a true Flash fan you will love this show. I can only say that this is show is awesome. The writers have done good work in writing the story. With every episode it becomes more and more interesting. The show's visual effects are ultimate. You just can't seem to find any difference in real or visual effects. The shows concepts are always new and it never fails to satisfy me. I would say If I were you I will watch it again. The series is a work of art. Barry is a superhero dealing with crime and meta-humans (Basically super villains) using his super speed to take them down with the help of his genius "crew" at STAR Labs. The series is overall interesting yet at some times, it can get a little confusing to some people (most likely a minority of all people, but of those people include me). Near the end of season 2, where (spoiler) Zoom is defeated by the Time Wraiths and Barry, the man in the mask who was imprisoned by Zoom was freed...<br/><br/>BOOM The doppelganger of Barry's father. After this, I thought a bit too much and I was like, "Wait... So there's infinite worlds and in each world there's a flash who is either Barry, his dad, or some other person? So there's just a bunch of random flashes everywhere that have the ability to time travel, control inter-dimensional travel, and run faster than Mach 3?"<br/><br/>So to all new viewers, I urge you not to think too much in depth about what happens and just stick to what is happening in the show. **spoiler The first 2 episodes were kinda slow but it starts to get more interesting each episode. season 1 I didn't really like Iris but I love the way the writers portrayed her in season 2 I also loved the way they had Caitlin and Iris have a heart to heart talks and I would love to see more of that in Season 3. the only thing I didn't like is they wasted half of season 2 on trying to make Barry and patty have a relationship when they could'v been using that time for a Barry and Iris relationship. I was mad when the writers made Barry run save his Mom and erase Barry and Iris kiss, but now seeing the trailer for season 3 I can't wait seeing how the writers are going to portray this idea I really like the Flash (2014-present) TV show. Although I have never read any of the comic books, I am still very impressed with the acting, and the storyline. It's great how the episodes build off of each other. Cisco is a funny protégé, Dr. Snow is brilliant, and Dr. Wells mysterious. They are all great characters. I like the cool names given to all of the villains, too. I am especially impressed with the acting, and that finally the superhero's love interest is an African American lady. Good job producers and directors! It nice to see a Black female be adored, and that her male suitors do not have to be African American as well. Although I know that some have commented that she is whiny, I think that Candance Patton is beautiful and perfect in this role instead. Grant Gustin is so handsomely adorable as the nerd turned superhero with an unfortunate past. From what I know of the Flash, he beautifully embodies this superhero. I also like that that actor is from Virginia. :-)Rick Cosnett is stunning as Iris's boyfriend and her father's detective partner. Mostly I love detective Joe West (Jesse L. Martin). He is gorgeous and quite a versatile actor. This show deserves 10 stars in my opinion. Well I started to watch this show last year,and I was pretty much hooked to it.First of all i had been following the comics of flash{HE is my Favorite} so I had a doubt if any TV show can match that standard{of the comics}so I didn't watched it at first but after the season 1 ended a friend of mine insisted me to watch it so I decided to give it a shot.<br/><br/>Honestly,It was totally worth it.The Flash is a Lighthearted show which combines humor and action perfectly,with a decent cast and some best VFX out there in television,All I can say is it is the best superhero show out there in the world!!!!!<br/><br/>PROS <br/><br/>Amazing cast<br/><br/>VFX!!!<br/><br/>Story lines<br/><br/>The villains{Reverse Flash and Zoom}<br/><br/>Cisco<br/><br/>Grant's portrayal of Barry Allen<br/><br/>Tom Cavanagh <br/><br/>Combines Darkness and Humor perfectly<br/><br/>CONS <br/><br/>Weak acting by Danielle Panabaker in some of the episodes<br/><br/>Overall rating:10/10 The Flash is the famous hero of DC comics. He is the fastest man in the world because it has the speed force that allows him to run at the speed of light. Flash has a worst enemy which is called Reverse Flash. Flash is embodied by a Barry Allen who is a agent of the scientific police. During is childhood the mother of Barry Allen was murdered by Reverse Flash and his was wrongly accused. Ten years after an explosion of particle Accelerator that is called Star Labs Barry Allen receives by an illuminated once his great meteor power. this moment until now Barry Allen as the Flash name lives only avenge his mother and to rehabilitate his Father. Flash is a series that appeared is 2015 in France this series has enormously action and suspense an that's what I like most. Then I love this series because the story is based in the universe of heroes and it is also this kind of series I prefer. Furthermore Flash is my favorite hero in the universe DC comics that is why I have chosen because I like the series with very good graphics and because the actors who played their roles well. In conclusion i can say that is one of the best series of 2014-2016 All of the reviews that complain about inconsistency and unbelievability are right. The physics in the show don't make sense. The way The Flash fights doesn't make sense. And his choices don't make sense.<br/><br/>These slowly seem to be going away as the series progresses. Perhaps the writers are becoming more adept? Or maybe they are finding their grove.<br/><br/>Anyway, the show is really crappy in the beginning, but by the end of season 1, it's quite enjoyable. There are still plenty of problems, but if you are looking for a show to watch casually and not feel depressed every time you watch it (e.g. Breaking Bad), give the whole of season 1 a shot.<br/><br/>On to season 2 for me! The Flash is a show based on the comic book hero The Flash who Mom was killed by a man in a yellow suit (The reverse Flash) that can run at the speed of light but years later Barry (The Flash)gets the same powers as the man who kill his mom and he must go and save his dad from prison, he went to prison for the murder of his wife.<br/><br/>The show has got 22 episodes to its first season and has got a second season half way throw at the time of this review.<br/><br/>The show has got a grate story and a grate casted.<br/><br/>the show has got subplots good writers<br/><br/>Good This show seems to be very polarizing on this site and others. Most people have reviewed the show immediately after the finale (which was great) had aired. This last episode avoided most of the things the show got wrong while affirming it's greatest strengths. However, the show still had a number of faults. I found Iris West, Barry Allen (the main character's) main love interest to be extremely annoying. A few others irked me too, but they eventually grew on me. Captain Cold spoke in a cartoony fashion, and the show took him too seriously for his cartoonish demeanor, and most other villains seems wasted except for Zoom, the big bad. Most of the action is forgettable, apart from a few cool set pieces, and the effects are pretty good for a basic Cable TV show. The worst part of the show is the romantic subplots (yes, that is plural for a reason), but even with those the show remains watchable. I must start out by saying I am giving this show an '8' for sheer fact of the potential headaches. I won't say how, but if you know the 'Flash' in DC-lore, you know time-travel plays a key component in his mytho's, which the show shares. That being said, the time- travel creates several instances on the show which elevates it to another level. Why? It keeps momentum. Flash has a rocky storyline, somewhat, in terms of momentum, but it's episodes are hit-or-miss in some ways. While I found them enjoyable, people may see that some episodes don't step it up from the previous, but none fall short of the previous ones fallout, and keeps expectations going forward.<br/><br/>That being said... the time travel introduces paradox's late in the story. I won't spoil anything, but it does get hairy. That said...<br/><br/>As a Flash fan, I will say, this show surpasses Arrow, but only because the creative team seemed to be aware of what they did wrong with Arrow, and capitalize on that. It's got it's flaws, but if you're a fan of anything super-hero related, this show delivers. That being said, as a DC-lore fan for the Flash in particular, don't hold it to the same stone. Several things are changed, somewhat for the better, but keeps the same in some regards.<br/><br/>I can't really sum up this show in a regards to the 'word limit' I am limited by for this review. If you like the DC-lore or just super- hero shows in general, I'd recommend the first few episodes. Patchy at first, so the first episode MAY deter people since it's obvious they were experimenting with elements, I wouldn't recommend getting an opinion until maybe five or six episodes in. Season is 23 episodes thus far, so you won't be wasting more than a few hours. <br/><br/>This show is far from perfect, but it manages to attain a level of stability that Arrow garnered after it's first season's 'mid-season' break. It's a nice contrast to Arrow's nature, and compliments it well to show how Barry and Oliver differ as heroes/vigilantes in their own regard, while still doing what they feel is 'justice' oriented. Fan or not of Arrow, I'd say this show at least deserves a viewing, properly. If you can't get into it, fine, but ignoring the potential of the show is honestly a mistake. We need a Batman Red Death season. Who do we need to petition for this to happen? I have watched a lot of tv shows, and a lot of them are good, but this one is the best! Well written, great acting, and just a great story overall, I would say every season of this show is amazing but Season 4 would be the most boring in my opinion, but the way that this show makes people happy, sad, and excited at the same time is crazy to me, and I would say there is only one downside to this show, that you have to watch Arrow to understand some of the episodes in this series, other than that, this is the best show that I have ever watched, and I extremely recommend this to anyone! Alright I know that CW is focused into teens but this is way over. The writing, the actors, the scenes, and the conversations all are beyond terrible.
Over the years instead of getting better, its getting worse.
Lots of plot holes, lots of cheap and bad CGI
Wouldn't recommend it to anyone As if Iris wasn't enough stupid in the show they added Nora now. Her existence is annoying! I have watched this show from the beginning and have been hooked ever since! For those that complain its not like the comics or the cartoon...its not supposed to be! It stands on its own!<br/><br/>Love Barry, Cisco, Caitlyn and Wells(no matter which one we get! Watch to figure out what I mean) Caitlyn as Killer frost always makes me smile as does Cisco!<br/><br/>The crossover episodes with Supergirl and Arrow are not to be missed! Great fun if you are a fan of the superhero universe but don't need a boring carbon copy of a comic book! hi can anyone help i am try to find a movie about a school boy who a movie star on the set he falls through a portal and movie role he playing he becomes him has anyone have any idea who the movie called the person play it was black person not being racist. The flash is the best TV show ever The Flash (Grant Gustin) and Cisco (Carlos Valdes) are good actors, but Dr Snow (Danielle Panabarker) is daytime soap opera material. Every time I watch the show and Dr Snows acting is bad it breaks my attention of the plot that it feels unreal. The Flashes Constant inner struggle about his family getting in the way is becoming annoying. He sounds whiny. We get it you don't want anybody to get hurt but you don't have to repeat it every three minutes . The Flash has had a solid plot with great pace and unexpected twist. The seamless incorporation of superpowers & concept like time travelling make the show a great work. The cast and there performances has been superb. <br/><br/>Grant Gustin as the Flash is instantly likable with his boyish charms & awkwardness. The supporting cast is also superb in there characterization and acting. Danielle Panabaker & Carlos Valdes brings the seriousness and silliness to the team with Tom Cavanagh bringing in the mentor with intriguing agenda. On the family side of Flas Jesse L. Martin is perfect as the step dad. <br/><br/>Season One – The Flash starts off with a bang with its young adorable cast does a great job of introducing Flash, his beginning and how he and his many enemies came about. We get a great nemesis's in terms of Reverse Flash. The plot is solid with some drama, romance & even tragedy. The action sequences are done up pretty well, especially the CGI Gorilla and a Tsunami. The season ends with a grand finale. (9/10)<br/><br/>Season Two – It was a high benchmark to match season one and got to say they did a pretty good job at it. Felt everything improved a notch, be it the acting, the new characters or the new twist in the plot. I really enjoyed the introduction of Earth 2 with its doppelganger having their version of our favourite characters. Zoom turned out to be darker and creepier villain then the yellow flesh. The action sequences and CGI effects were even better than the previous season, King Shark looked amazing. My only real disappointment was the overuse of time jump concept and confusion in this regard. (9/10) OK this show is amazing finally a good show about The Flash is awesome i mean come on since Smallville i never saw a show so good... Arrow is decent but not very good for me and DC Legengs Of Tomorrow caught my eye but i still have to watch it i only saw one ep from DC LOT The Flash is awesome Barry fighting crime the whole Wells thing, Reverse Flash, Zoom, Earth-02!!! the show is really awesome i definitely gonna keep watching and i recommend it unlike Smallville i like this one more...<br/><br/>See this show you'll love it specially if you like shows like Arrow and Smallville really watch the show dude...<br/><br/>My name is Bruce and i watch The Flash!! Yeah guys i am going to tell everyone about this show.First of all we have all came across with the different types of superheroes like Spidey batman superman and iron man etc.Now its time for flash.A forsenic scientist who is 25 years obviously the superheroes are little young who lost his mother when he was 11 years old by something impossible and his father was wrongly accused of that killing her wife.So the hero who is doing his job as well as searching for the the true criminal who killed his mother to get his father out of the prison.So one day in the central city where he lives by some closer area is the star labs located and they are doing the process of particle accelerator which is a device that uses electromagnetic fields to propel charged particles is going on progressing and as usual something goes wrong and the particle accelerator gets booked and there was full of explosions and the lightning hits the Barry Allen and he wants to coma after nine months he wakes up in the star labs and he feel he can run faster than light.so with this superhero powers he stars to doing three tasks 1.Helping the people from danger 2.Finding the other people like him who where not like him 3.Finding the killer who kills his mother So coming to the casting of the movie is pretty much average except the Barry Allen and some other characters u will felt there are doing nice.The next part is u can see the arrow coming and going in-between the episode which is not good when the arrow character comes what I felt.coming to the music is the worst part of the series which is nothing the same one which is using in superhero movies for years and years.So overall thanks for reading this big review and I hope if is good .I can it won't disappoint u throughout just a little flaws.Enjoy the series and have fun.... If Eobard Thawne is Reverse-Flash/Professor Zoom.. then Eddie Thawne is or probably will be "Hunter Solomon". Just a wild guess here :)<br/><br/>You see how the story goes, now that Iris knew Barry is the Flash, We all knew that even though Iris was with Eddie, the storyline will end up being in-love together with Barry. This show on the newspaper on the time vault that the reporter name was Iris West Allen. So in the end it was Barry and Iris. Enraged on what happen, when Barry defeated Eobard. Eddie Thawne became the new arch-nemesis which would probably be on Season 2 or last episode of Season 1 that will reveal or portray to be "Hunter Solomon".<br/><br/>I am also interested to see how this TV series will open up other characters like the brother twin of Barry Allen who is Malcolm Thawne (Cobalt Blue)..<br/><br/>Or if the writers choose to kill Barry Allen, would there be a possibility to introduce "Black Flash".<br/><br/>I am excited to see how this storyline will goes, well this was just my prediction. Feel free to add your opinion or your point. Thanks. Greg! Move your head... BACK into the game! Do you remember when this was fun? Do you remember when you just loved comics and wanted to tell good heroic stories? Do you remember when you weren't bound and determined to jam pack every episode of every one of your series with social commentary to push your own personal political agendas? Fun has been stripped from the CW DC shows. The Flash has taken a back seat to his own show. Supergirl... wow... so much worse than The Flash. Who knows about Legends? Does anyone watch it anymore? It started good... then degenerated into total slapstick silliness and even more propaganda. Bye bye CW DC shows! You had an awesome beginning! Greg! Come on, man! Can you not separate your work from your home life? Please reach back to those beginning times when your shows were fun and exciting! Tell good stories! Flash, yes we know quite well what to expect from the title. Sad to say however, that trend continues through the episodes - you know what to expect. A lot of clichés and predictable pieces of story line. Add to that the at times illogical chain of events and thoughtless dialogue and we have a cause for frustration on our hands. In short this show is well done and worth the watch IF you are perhaps a young and naive individual, suitable for the kids, and less appealing to those perhaps over 15 years of age and who want current flowing through their brains while watching this. All about the target market perhaps. Savitar Should've killed Iris she's just a useless, nagging character. I had such high hopes for Flash, my favourite all time hear , reduced to an incompetent whiner who changes his core character traits every episode based on the plot of the week. Book-ended with two of the WORST actors I've come across playing two of the worse characters in kind. First being Candice Patton who we've suffered through 5 seasons of blandness. ONLY for them to hire an even worse but appropriately portrayed offspring by the actor , Jessica Parker Kennedy. My level of hatred of these two soap opera level muppets is unending.<br/><br/>The last episode of season 5 surrounds the dramatic and supposed heroic demise of Nora Flash which left me cheering for a painful death. How does anyone feel anything for these characters? Now if we can only kill off Iris we might have a slight improvement in season 6.<br/><br/>Terrible writing of women in general. and don't get me started with the dough-head mind-reader married to the sedated guy from Law and Order. It's good It's good It's good It's good It's good It's good It's good It's good It's good It's good It's good It's good It's good It's good It's good It's good It's good It's good It's good It's goodIt's good It's good It's good It's good It's good It's good It's good It's good It's good It's goodIt's good It's good It's good It's good It's good It's good It's good It's good It's good It's goodIt's good It's good It's good It's good It's good It's good It's good It's good It's good It's goodIt's good It's good It's good It's good It's good It's good It's good It's good It's good It's good The show is actually very entertaining, but it unfortunately suffers from constantly ranging between being a little dumb to going all out and being insanely stupid. It's full of potential, but would be a lot better if there weren't so many gaps in logic and moments that are way too cheesy. On the plus side it has some very likable characters and an intriguing overarching plot. <br/><br/>If you can look past these things you'll probably like the show. It's targeted at a younger audience and similar to Smallville and Arrow, so if you like those show give the Flash a watch, but be prepared for it being the cheesiest superhero show out there. It's a show for mindless mechanical drama. People are made to do things and make decisions which no normal thinking person would, only to create highly contrived situations for over-emoting drama. The latter being well done, but it can't carry the show alone. If none of the scenes fit together with any kind of sensibility, all that I watch it for is style. Turn off any scrap of thought. I like the series,but the show would be great without Cisco's character. So they say not to write spoilers on here but yet they wrote one for the description of the last one revealing something that was apparently a lie. Just read it and you will know what I mean. Kind of like how I don't like how they give you a preview of what is coming up on a TV show like with courts as it gets annoying having to see what they already shown just not to its entirety. Anyways I just thought I would say something about the description of the last episode it spoils everything. As long as humanity will exist, good and bad will a part of it and this battle will continue not only in reality but it has been made an incredible part of fantasy as well. <br/><br/>Why do we love watching these Super-heroes who are ordinary beings but with an agenda to fight crime, well don't the Law enforcement agencies like the Police do that, yes but what makes these super crime fighters so different is that they don't go by the book. One reason we love watching is to get that feeling, which is unexplainable in many ways. <br/><br/>These super crime fighters are the judge, the jury and the executioner. They have a past, which turns them into Vigilantes; to save the city they love and go where the Police literally cannot penetrate. <br/><br/>Some of these are millionaires who act as playboys/Casanovas by the day but put on a mask, well almost literally to do the job by the night, these include Tony Stark (Iron Man), Bruce Wayne (Batman/The Dark Knight), Oliver Queen (The Arrow). They have no paucity of funds so they build fancy toys and employ computer nerds to keep a tab on the Police radio, crime movement. Others are ordinary crime reporters, one to whom no one bothers about, that would be Peter Parker (Spider Man), Clarke Kent (Super Man/Man of Steel) who go about their daily work in the most ordinary way, living in small apartments which they can afford, making their presence felt only as Super Man and Spider Man respectively, their alter egos- as leading a double life. Then we have the Avengers, a mixture of all the above categories brought together by a common goal. <br/><br/>Lets get back to the topic- THE FLASH OF THE 90's is now the father of the THE FLASH OF 2014. Well in all our Super Heroes saga, we forget about an incredible one- The Flash ( Barry Allen), the only super hero whose identity is known to the Police in fact he works with the Police as an ordinary forensic scientist, and he got his powers by the worst accident possible. <br/><br/>In the 90s, there came a TV show called The Flash, it wasn't a new concept because Batman and Superman had already penetrated the Movie Halls and we had another super hero being created. Incredibly even India has its own Super Hero- Shaktimaan in then 80s and 90s but didn't work due to many reasons. As would be evident, he gains his power through psychic and yoga. <br/><br/>The Flash is the main focus of our discussion because in 2014, The Flash reemerged on the TV scenes, played by Grant Gustin whose father goes to jail wrongly accused of killing the Flash's mother. The individual who plays his father was believe it or not as a coincidence the same who played the role of flash in its first appearance in 1990 played by John Wesley Shipp. Both shows may differ in terms of story line, plots, technological usage but they play the same alter egos. <br/><br/>What is common in all these Heroes is that they all will continue to have a nemesis who wants them eliminated once they come in to contact with each other<br/><br/>Here is a List of those super heroes who remain fixated on one<br/><br/>The Dark Knight/ Batman- The Joker<br/><br/>Superman- Lex Luthor This is perhaps the only thing that makes me think the DC Cinematic Universe is a remotely good idea. While I find that DC will probably suffer for attempting to take down Marvel when their universe is clearly so developed already, The Flash has provided some sparks at hope that DC may become equal to, if not better than, Marvel in terms of their film universes. With a deep and complex plot, well-developed characters and a theme that stays true to the world-renowned comics, it's hard to find flaws with this TV show. If only DC's other elements of its universe, such as Man of Steel and Arrow, were anywhere near this good. I will say, however, that I am still concerned with the quality of DC films and TV shows. If they want to take the fight to Marvel, both their films and Arrow need to improve greatly. Gotham and The Flash should be the benchmark for all of their content. The Flash had 2 fun, well paced seasons. The Flash has had 2 unpleasant, poorly written and poorly made seasons. I don't know if the showrunners have it in them to provide a new, quality season of the show after two back to back duds, however I am hesitantly hopeful. At its best the show is constantly charged with an endearing energy, and masterfully works within its constraints. It has not done this in 2 years. I would recommend the first 2 seasons and if you really love the characters give the 3rd and 4th seasons a look. But keep your expectations low, especially going into season 5 Iris is the best part of this show and anyone who says otherwise is racist 👍 To me,season 1 is the best season of Flash.I loved Grant Gustin's portrayal of the Scarlet speedster and Tom Cavanagh's portrayal of Harrison Wells/Eobard Thawne.The flash comprises of great actors such as Candice Patton,Danielle Panabaker,Jesse.L.Martin,Carlos Valdes etc.<br/><br/>Season 2 introduced the idea of the multiverse.The villain in season two was Zoom(Hunter Zolomon- Portrayed by Teddy Sears and voiced by Tony Todd).Zoom was a great villain too,but I felt season 2 was not as great as Season 1.I loved Zoom's dark,demonic costume and behaviour,but to me,season 2 was not the best.<br/><br/>Season 3 came to me as a huge disappointment.I felt it was the worst season of all.I didn't follow the idea of the Philosopher's stone and why the CW show ripped off Harry Potter.I didn't find the necessity of the philosopher's stone in the show.I also discovered number of plot holes in the season finale.*Spoilers*When Savitar figured out about HR Wells taking Iris' place,why couldn't just go back and kill Iris,instead of wasting time talking with Barry Allen,who convinced to help him,and stop the paradox from ever reaching me.I liked Danielle Panabaker's portrayal of Caitlin Snow,but I didn't like her portrayal of her alter ego killer frost.I also noticed that in the ending fight(Barry,Wally,Jay vs Savitar)Savitar cut down some tree's while running,and surprisingly,they fell down at the same speed at which the speedsters were running.Wally had to slide underneath the tree which was moving fast.Maybe the tree got hit by lightning and someone splashed chemicals on it,giving it super speed? I also don't understand how the Partical accelerator fuses things.Such as the mirror guy.He just fell into the mirror during the explosion.How did he get fused with it?And King shark.I believe that a man and a shark were taking a selfie together,and suddenly they get fused due to the explosion? I hope Flash season 4 won't be this bad. So entertaining and engaging. I love this show, the characters are so lovable, I don't want it to end! See if they did what they did at the end of season one with calling in favors from other arrowverse shows characters, it would help ratings and fill some plot holes, They do it in the comics they can do it here If I wanted to see a TV show which was exactly the same thing as comics, why the hell would I want to watch a TV show. Comics and TV shows are 2 different things. TV show has to be different, otherwise you already know what a going to happen. Love this show. This show is amazing. so many people say to "kill off iris". in reality, iris is good and is an important part of the cast. without her there would be an absence of a traditional non metahuman feminine presence. there is soooo many reviews that people say she ruins the show. also people keep saying that the show isn't well written? as if EVERY show EVER is the most intricate and brilliant thing ever seen. i guarantee some of those people also think stuff like riverdale and south park are "well written, amazing shows" and are worth 10/10 instead of the actual .1/10 they are. Why is everyone so serious?<br/><br/>If you're expecting more than a comic book, move on. It's fun for what it is. The Iris hate in these reviews looks like astroturfing, to be honest.<br/><br/>This is not a serious show. Complaining that the science is fake is weird, because *of course the science is fake*. It's a live-action cartoon.<br/><br/>Complaining that the show is implausible/contradictory/silly is laughable. It's Generation Z with super powers for heaven's sake. There's nothing realistic about it, nor was there meant to be. Yes, it's silly.<br/><br/>The complaint about the Justice League approach could be considered somewhat legit if that approach is a bothers to you. It isn't a bother to me. I like the cross pollination of all the DC super hero shows.<br/><br/>This melodrama gets more light-hearted and gets a sense of humor as it progresses (occasionally, it could be a little too heavy-handed for a cartoon in the first couple of seasons).<br/><br/>For the most part, the gentlemen anchor the show. Tom Cavanaugh and his multiple takes on the Wells character are a joy. Grant Gustin is great at making you want to take him by the shoulders and shake him. Carlos Valdez as Cisco is funny and endearing. Jessie L. Martin as Joe laughs a lot, and it's a departure from his character on Law & Order.<br/><br/>Candice Patton as Iris and Danielle Panabaker as Caitlin are both fine. Yes, Iris gets a fair amount of attention in the middle seasons, but so what? The Flash does not disappear from the overall story arc.<br/><br/>The entire cast can cry on cue, and they do so often.<br/><br/>"The Flash" is just a goof, and expecting more is setting oneself up for disappointment. Approach it like a melodrama/comedy and it's a riot. Very beautiful And fun personal best Dr. Wells villain Although most of the flash fans hate Candice Patton because of her character, she is good enough to show comic Iris's Curiosity and bravery.
It was a good episode because it answered most of the rumors about Barry and Iris relationship and sue dearbon issue. I gave it a 7 because the first half of then seasons are excellent. They have great consistency and keeps u on edge. But half of the seasons don't have the same excitement and some of the villains are underwhelming Its a great superhero show. It goes on for too long unfortunately. The characters are quirky and likable. If you haven't seen all of flash do not read this will spoil future episodes if not seen, In season 4 episode 1 of the flash Barry got taken out of the speed force and started talking oddly but I realized that every word said has occurred in different seasons of the flash "this house" Nora said that when she traveled to the past on season five when they first met he talked about his moms muder and how his dad didn't do it and he talked about the particle accelerator like he'd did in the very first episode while explaining it to iris First off this is a tv show based on a comic. Relax. Those looking for high stakes dramas should look elsewhere. Second this is a fun show not to be taken too seriously. There is phenomenal drama in the immortal bard's plays. Please do yourself a favor and go there for your drama needs. Might I suggest Macbeth?<br/><br/>I like my superhero stories accessible and interesting. This show delivers on both. Flash is interesting, Cisco is funny, and the villains are challenging enough without overpowering the main characters.<br/><br/>Regarding iris. Please develop her. No need to kill her. (Why's everyone on here mad at her personally? Relax. She's just an actress. Bad or boring characters are the fault of bad writing and direction.) Just give her something useful to say/do. Aren't we done writing one demential ball and chain females? Give her powers or something. I'd like to see writers give her more than just being pretty to look at and constantly in need of reassurance and saving. Starts as a brighter, chirpy versioned series of Arrowverse, especially after (a bit) dark, broody mentor/counterpart Arrow - turns into a drab drama over something which does not happen (Barry's death). Now it's all over the place.
Barry-Iris romance seems so fake in the earlier seasons as if actors have been pushed into it; till they introduce Nora (daughter) the most irritating wrongfully casted character I ever came across. She looks 30yo, supposed to be around 25y and acts like less than 15yo girl! It is then that Barry-Iris fakeality seems like a blurr.
DC has one thing constant, starts of with great plot, good lead actors then after 2 season of 23 episodes starts struggling with plots and castings, fumbles, destroys the character and series. Show is pretty good, like the ensemble cast. Nora west Allen is the worst f ing character ever. Makes me want to quit watching the show or skip the whole 5th season. I stopped watching this first time round when I got annoyed at two blokes with guns getting the better of supersonic Flash, but all the positive reviews encouraged me to give it another go, and it's true that it is well worth a watch. But what annoys me every time is seeing these super villains locked up in cells with no sign of a food tray and - even worse - no toilet bucket in the corner of their cell. Such issues of verisimilitude didn't worry me when I was a 7 year-old kid reading comics. I sometimes yearn to get back the innocent naivety of childhood, when you believed in Santa and didn't ask questions like this. I've seen the first season and I really like the actors, the story, the special effects, etc. BUT sometimes the script dialogue is a bit silly, they should have better writers or improve on it. ALSO, there're some scenes that just don't make any sense (relating to flash"es powers and the reality) Show is ok. Gets repetitive with each seasson and with more and more bad choices but still fun to watch. The show is getting better and better with each episode. Don't listen to any of the whiny little c-u-n-ts they are mad because their fathers don't love them. This is a really good show. I like Barry and Iris. Season 5 was pretty boring. Hope season 6 is better Season 1 was very good. Not even half way through season 2, Barry is so annoying. He has amazing super power and all his actions are emotional not logical. However most of the action is like repeating season 1. God this is bad. Should have cancelled the show after season 1. When I discovered The Flash, I fell madly in love with it. The actors were lovable and engaging. The storylines were also well crafted and enjoyable. However, over several seasons, I became a bit annoyed that they introduced a storyline and when I watched the following episode thinking to get a conclusion, it was if it never happened. It took about three instances for me to realize I needed to watch The Arrow or Supergirl to find out what happened to that particular story. I can imagine this was a good idea to get persons to watch these other series. But I was in love with The Flash and not with The Arrows and Supergirl and I had no intention of watching those other series. Therefore, I felt cheated to be intrigued by a storyline and then not getting to know how the story concluded because it was assigned to The Arrow.
The next issue I had, and the most upsetting, was the writers' obsession with Tom Cavanagh. They casted him in several different characters to the point it became RIDICULOUS! It's as if they were conflicted about whether to have The Flash as an Action/Fantasy or a full out comedy. I could not bear it. I think the suit in Season 4 was then season 5 suit I didn't like that much please change the suit I'm rating this review based on all 5 seasons. It's only fair to do it this way. Just about every show has its up and down seasons.I have enjoyed following this show. Killer Frost is bad a$$.The reasons I didn't rate this higher was simply because of the outfits for Flash, Kid Flash, and Sysco are awful. I do like how this series is part of the DC crossover by sometimes using Arrow and Supergirl. Love that idea. That guy ruins for me the flash. He is such a baby in the movie, and he is super pretentious, hot head, full of air, and has a huge self-ego that the whole world can do without.<br/><br/>I wish they just kill him off, cause as far as actors go, he is the embodiment of all those people who are wrong with the world.<br/><br/>When people try to save his butt and help him as a person, so he goes huffy and puffy as a baby and frankly, why they bother with him in the first place is beyond me.<br/><br/>He is better off alone and miserable, a guy like that doesn't deserve to be better.<br/><br/>If they continue to keep him, then the Flash's rating will go downill fast, if it has not already have.<br/><br/>someday, the producers will recognize what is wrong with the series and the ratings, and do the right step. Flash is a jerk. Felicity is the best of the best sexiest girl on Flash. I started the show, and immediately was bothered by bad acting, cheesy script, but for some reason, I just love The Flash, the idea of it, and some of the characters interactions are charming and fun - Cisco was annoying, but also funny to watch, Barry was actually kind of fun to watch too - I really enjoyed watching Season 1, despite the shows flaws. Season 2 was also still pretty watchable.<br/><br/>Season 3 started, and it just felt a lot worse, stopped watching, and then came back to it. There are some really great moments - but I find most episodes pretty painful to watch - the dialogue dealing in so many absolutes (we have to do this, or we have to do that...) No! You don't have to do that at all!, why would you think that? The silly TV show logic astounds me, and it happens in almost every episode.. something I was mostly able to overlook in the early seasons. I'm sure I'll make it to season 4, and we'll see if I make it to season 5.<br/><br/>The musical episode in Season 3... The ending was a highlight for me, I love musicals, and I love the poppy songs of Benj Pasak and Justin Paul, so that was a big surprise for my family and I when Barry sings that song to Iris.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with that episode, is that there is too much dialogue, and the plot makes no sense. I really just wanted more singing and dancing, they should have gone full musical, and just got Pasak and Paul to write everything.<br/><br/>I thought the acting in Fringe and Bones was bad at times, but this is much worse, it's bad acting mixed with bad dialogue and plot.. but I'm giving this 5 stars for keeping me to season 3.. and an extra star because I do like Flash, and time travel... This is a fun, light TV program. The only problem I have with it is that the women are all dolled up and overly sexualised. They would be much more believable if they wore normal clothes to work, and relaxed clothes at home. Not every woman has to be wearing short skirts and wear bright red lipstick. Keep the women normal people and this show will gain in credence and respectability. I was never a big Flash comic reader but there has got to be other storylines better than the ones they keep revisiting. They were not that great the first time. I hate shows where I find myself yelling at the screen because one character or another (usually Barry) is doing something so monumentally stupid, or all of them are ignoring something so glaringly obvious that I want to pound my head against the screen. Instead of a show about the perpetually insecure Flash and his gang of super whiners, there are lots of DC comics characters that I would love to see in their own series with the sort of gritty sensibility of Arrow or Gotham. Characters like the Teen Titans and Wonder Girl, or the deliciously perverse and conflicted HARLEY QUINN! Put her in a reluctant partnership with Deadpool; that would make for a show with unlimited potential!!<br/><br/>Edited to add: I've been browsing my way through this series, and to my complete surprise (esp. given many other reviews) I found Season 4 suddenly largely devoid of the flaws of earlier episodes. Lots of new writers, evidently. The show leapt out of its rut and stopped taking itself too seriously. Crisp dialog and unexpected plot twists make the characters all look like they've had an overnight IQ boost of 20 points or more. For the first time I'm finding times when the show is actually LOL funny. Moments of outright zaniness. Upping my rating to 7 overall, largely because of the huge improvement in Season 4. I love Flash, but I think they could do a lot better in the series. Season 1 and 2 have great story and excellent humor. Season 3 was a poor attempt to be like arrow. Season 4 was a great season but unfortunately due to take deaths ruins some of the storyline. First 2 season great! 3rd not bad. But 4th is terrible. Overall this movie is great.. but when Barry Allen goin back to past or future.. i become confuse :D (Disclaimer: I'm only on season 3)<br/><br/>The show has great action and the actors are really good at playing the parts they are given. However, these characters that the writers have created can be really annoying at times.<br/><br/>Barry is constantly just running into trouble without thinking which is really irresponsible for a hero. He also thinks that it's not a problem to travel through time and mess everything up until season 3 when he creates flashpoint and literally almost ends the world.<br/><br/>Iris is an ok character but her and Barry's relationship is a little weird considering they're literally adoptive siblings. <br/><br/>Cisco is literally a little kid it feels like.<br/><br/>Caitlyn/Killer Frost is actually really interesting and probably one of the only characters I really care about.<br/><br/>Anyone else is expendable to me and I don't really care.
The logic doesn't make sense at all. In season 1 when Eddie killed himself to keep Eobard Thawne from being born, that should've worked. For the life of me, I can't understand how the reverse flash is still around. Also, Barry can literally just take weapons from people's hands and, if they're a metahuman, put power dampening cuffs on them. He's the fastest man alive!!! If he can run so fast it sends him back in time then he can take down simple villains like captain cold with no problem.
In one of the first episodes, Felicity asked if Barry aged faster. I thought this was a very good question that I would still like to know. <br/><br/>Even with all of these problems, the show still manages to keep me invested with some of the main characters and confuse me enough to keep watching to find out what happens. The Flash is a brilliant TV Show. I must admire Greg Berlanti and Mark Guggenheim's work they have brilliantly worked off of the show that was Arrow to produce an even better show formerly known as The Flash hence brought the arrowverse together with crossovers every season and brings a worth watching story line to the table.
I must say i did binge watch the first two seasons within a week but was worth the time as I have witnessed plenty of action and even just a good old 10 minute cheesy scene that bores the hell out of people almost every episode. What can you really expect? From speedsters such as the Reverse Flash ,who brings the character of Barry Allen to life, as the emotions are distributed massively throughout the show but you still do not want to kill him just yet. To speedsters such as Zoom who leaves the viewer at the edge of their seats after every minor sighting. I must say Zoom is a fan favourite but still makes you want to rip him open by the end of season 2.<br/><br/>Writers managed to keep the pace until Season 3 where the only thing you would think of is what timeline is this season set in again? The time travelling is crazy along with the intergalactic travels. Storyline is not clear but writers still manage to base the entire season off of one character: IRIS WEST. Iris West holds no importance in the show and would be better off in a grave by now. The stakes would be higher and viewership would enlarge as characters would focus more on the whole concept of the show. Which is the fastest man alive, well not really. as every season every other speedster is faster.
Quick Advice: Do not base the show on any character of no importance besides the main character. I am not a fan of DC, however I have seen series 1, 2, and part of series 3 of this show. <br/><br/>Season 1 - This season is entertaining and clever. There are lots of interesting and well-executed concepts. The acting and the reused footage are all fun. This season is fun and engaging. I enjoyed watching this.<br/><br/>Season 2 - This dumb show got dumber. The characters lost IQ points. The writers couldn't find new villains so they just recast the same guy as the primary antagonist. The effects got worse. No-one working on this could figure out how to put time travel on the show and have it make sense. Watching this season is like watching a train wreck. <br/><br/>Season 3 - I don't understand why they couldn't get another actor to play the villain. This season got so idiotic I had to stop. Watching this CG mess of stupidity is like watching a city burn. The first season was good so for some reason the decision was made to slash the budget and fire the writers (I'm assuming that's what happened).<br/><br/>DC made the first season good by accident. They tried to make the next ones enjoyable, but failed miserably. This is the jack of all trades when it comes to superhero tv shows! It has a great cast of well-developed characters and never fails to throw surprises right in your face. The villains are strong and interesting and are done really well. Arrow, Legends of tomorrow, black lightning, krypton, supergirl and the gifted have got nothing on the fastest man alive. This show is on Netflix and deserves a watch from anyone who loves superheroes. The reason why I gave 8 stars is that, vfx, characterisation are good. Though the episodes are very sloppy, he s a hero not everyone spoken of. He's my childhood hero, not sure about all 90's kids.so a one time watchable for Fan moment The flash series is great but the only problem is that there is to much smoochy smoochy and the science of going back in time is wrong the comics were more scientifically true but otherwise it's great. Very well put together. Even with it's predictability, the characters are always vibrant and the plots melds together like a fine wine. 8 Stars!!! Great show, although some writing/episodes in my opinion aren't good. Also didn't like Barry changing time to get his parents back, that was very unhero like. Still worth watching, giving it a 7/10.<br/><br/>Caitlynn is my favorite meta, and absolutely love the ice ramp movement, hadn't seen that in any tv series since the 1980's iceman character.<br/><br/>Would love to see a spin-off with Jessie Quick! Maybe a Wally + Jessie Quick earth 2 tv series, or even just episodes. I consider these to be the more true hero 's than barry, due to the Barry changing time thing. The Flash is a great show for the most part. It brings a true comic book feel to the table, more so than any of the other super hero shows or movies out there today. It feels like you are watching a live action comic book, from the dialogue and the way characters act to the way the meta humans and monsters look. The story is fun and really draws viewers in, and it is definitely something to look forward to every week. The show is definitely very cheesy however, with many plot holes and easy ways to get around problems. However, these are just part of the general comic book feel in my opinion, and it is easily ignorable. Overall, it was a great movie and definitely something you should look into if you are a fan of the comic book genre. First thing off, the cast members are great 👍 but the storyline? Not so great. The story is the same old just like the previous episodes just diff. People and villain. There's no suspense or thrilling in the story. It's like we already what's gonna happen. A great example is when they like to hide things from supposedly team and in the end they're like, we trust and need each other. Like? That's how the script gonna go? I mean I think I just saw it on the last season. Oh and the fact that he could've done things in the first place which he did before. But hey I'm not a writer right? I'm just one of the million people watching it, I think that's why I stopped watching it. Same reason why I watching Arrow. The storyline and script needs to get better or the show might not last long as it wanted to be. Bec. I noticed it how many people you would think would noticed it too and get bored with it? <br/><br/>Ps. The rating is for the show storyline and script. Not the cast members. Its a fine show but you need to take leave of your physics and your linear thinking. My greatest wish with the show is that they try to be more consistent. If the Flash can pick a bullet from the back of his head with his bare hands without dying there should be no chance what so ever that an ordinary criminal could lay hands on him, for instance. However if you're up for a bit of light entertainment and no deep story plot then this is the action show for you! I would like to know if any positions on the show are still open I am a teenager who loves the flash. I looked up almost everything that has to do with the flash. I realized that if the show keeps going in the same direction there will eventually be a "Kid Flash". I was wondering if there was any way to get in contact with the creators of the CW show to maybe talk about any possible ways to be on he show. If anyone would have a way or any idea on how to contact them please let me know. I would love to be on the show in any form. This show is great. I watch every episode. And I love the way CW portrays the flash. Please let me know with any information For once I'd like to see the Flash get the same treatment as Daredevil did with Netflix. Both superheroes are quirky, with superpowers that would fall flat if not for a strong story or hero to uphold them. That's why I've always loved the Flash. Sure, speedsters are a dime a dozen, but the Flash (Barry Allen, hell even Wally West) is special. When you give him a network television channel show however, he's never going to fare as well as we would want him to. There are too many stipulations like how attractive the actors must be, how stressed the romantic implications must be, and on and on. I have to admit, when I watched the first two episodes I literally cringed. Everything went too fast and assumptive. It felt too hokey, and was dripping with the sarcastic generic adolescent angst that plagued and ruined Smallville in it's later episodes.<br/><br/>But I had to give the show a chance, I mean c'mon, it's the Flash! I'll tell you what, about around the fourth episode things got interesting. Around the sixth I was hooked. **SPOILER ALERT!** Ever watch that X-Men Evolution cartoon? I like to compare these two shows because they're both so similar in the fact that they both portray our heroes as young adults. That's one big feature that helped me get hooked. You see, this show isn't about the grown up Barry Allen from the comics, this is about a younger Barry in a different time line who grew up and became the Flash in similar yet different ways. So, because this is a different time line, the CW isn't committing sacrilege against what we have all held to be true about the Flash, they have created a whole new ball game with a whole new set of circumstances. Sure, the adolescent garble and angst can get pretty annoying at times, but at least I'm not getting irritated because they aren't being as mature as the Barry I know from the comics and that's a big plus. **SPOILERS OVER**<br/><br/>In closing, I'd like to say again, true the show isn't the masterpiece I wanted for the Flash, but it's not half bad and I've only watched the first season. I'm sure the second will be pretty good too. You just have to get past the first five or six episodes. And also just accept that Captain Cold only gets cheesier.
