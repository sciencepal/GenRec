Darren Criss as Andrew Cunanan just Amazing!!! The writing excellent!! The whole cast just mesmerizing! This series continues to surprise me! I barely knew about the OJ Simpson scenario so everything about that is glorious while being outrageous! I'd like to see the second season for now I am the middle of season 1, it's quite enjoyable and intriguing. Ryan Murphy the creator/writer is a mastermind for many projects, I would definitely recommend this show. Telling the story of the murder of Gianni Versace (<a href="/name/nm1183149/">Edgar RamÃ­rez</a>) at the hands of Andrew Cunanan (<a href="/name/nm2023050/">Darren Criss</a>), what's especially interesting about this season of American Crime Story is the narrative structure. The opening scene of the first episode sees the murder, and the show then goes backwards, with each episode set earlier than the previous one, an achronological structure that unifies form and content; this isn't about a murder, it's about how Cunanan became a serial killer.<br/><br/>Within this, the show deals with two interrelated issues; 1) the concept that one must work hard to be successful, and 2) the desire to be remembered. Cunanan is obsessed with the second, but unwilling to acknowledge the first, despite his conviction of his own greatness. His attitude is nicely critiqued by Versace himself ("Life isn't about convincing people you can do great things. It's about doing them"), and the last shot masterfully encapsulates much of Cunanan's deepest existential fears. For all that, however, the season is good, but not great. The last two episodes are far and away the strongest, especially <a href="/name/nm1490183/">Jon Jon Briones</a>'s appearance as Modesto, Cunanan's detestable father, but, overall, it isn't a patch on 'The People v. O.J. Simpson'. This series is riveting, well directed, fast-paced and informative. The casting is marvelous with one little exception: OJ Simpson!! Cuba Gooding is a fantastic actor, but he completely fails to portray OJ Simpsons incredible charm and charisma that actually enabled him to sliver through years of abusive behavior and the cold-blooded double murder. Gooding is reactive and unsophisticated, while the cocksure Simpson is just missing. This is an incredible failure of casting where the remaining characters are spot on and compelling. Why not Dwayne Johnson or someone with the physical charisma and cool? Travolta deserves great kudos for taking this on, but one has to wonder why he allowed the utter miscasting of the major role. At any rate, this is a worthwhile series to watch and it surely is award-rich. When I read the critic's reviews of this fascinating portrayal of the trial of OJ Simpson, the most common complaint was John Travolta's performance. So I was expecting to find it a bad, cheesy performance and everyone else to be great.<br/><br/>Instead, I thought Travolta did an excellent job as a supercilious attorney who finds himself increasingly outside his own case. True, Travolta has had so much plastic surgery that he looks like he was sewn together by a dollmaker, but his performance is, while not as notable as the really terrific performances by Nathan Lane and, more surprisingly, David Schwimmer, it's a solid performance.<br/><br/>The truly awful performance is by Cuba Gooding as O.J.<br/><br/>When I watched the movie, I thought Gooding seemed wrong based on my vague memories of O.J. I'm not a sports fan, I didn't follow the trial, which at the time I thought of as just another lurid celebrity crime, and I'd only seen Simpson in a small part in a movie years ago. I thought Gooding's whiny, unpleasant, crybaby performance seemed untrue to that memory, but I couldn't be sure.<br/><br/>Then I watched the terrific documentary series. O.J., Made in America, and I realized that Gooding was really horrible. He lacked O.J.'s famous charm, and instead came across as ineffectual where the documentary portrays O.J. as a strong force in his own defense.<br/><br/>If you've never seen Simpson at all, perhaps the performance would seem fine, but it's an absolutely wretched performance from the point of view of verisimilitude. It's easily the biggest flaw in an otherwise gripping portrayal.<br/><br/>Why the critics didn't notice that I can't say. I enjoyed the first series revolving around the OJ Simpson murder trial, the second series is all about the assassination of fashion designer Gianni Versace.<br/><br/>The emphasis throughout the series on the serial killer Andrew Cunanan rather than Versace himself, although we do get to see a good amount of backstory on Versace also. <br/><br/>We get a real raw insight into Cunanan's psychotic mind, background and his shocking killing spree. It is a very gripping series and Darren Criss played the role of murderer Cunanan absolutely outstandingly and in my opinion deserves an award for his portrayal of this complex character. <br/><br/>My only criticism is the timeline jumps were confusing at times, when there's a week between episodes and each episode centering on a different year and back and forth rather than chronologically, I did get confused at times of what took place when. It did all come together though in the final episode. My only complaint about Season 2 is that there is to much conjecture about Cunanan's relationship with his some of his victims. We see an entire episode about him traveling with David, conversations they have, David's reluctance to escape...no one but Andrew and David knows what really happened in the apartment or the days following, or what conversations took place. Maybe Cunanan had a gun on him the entire time. Same with Miglin and the discussions about his Space Needle, or Miglin willingly allowing Cunanan to tape him up. Things may have in fact been very different. The case of O.J. Simpson is one that received wide scale media coverage and attention with the events being closely followed by many and is now the topic of season 1 of FX's new biographical crime drama, American Crime Story. However despite this, this show manages to remain just as gripping and haunting as the case was in real life.<br/><br/>The acting is across the board incredibly strong with not a weak performance among the main ensemble; Cuba Gooding Jr. and John Travolta in particular stand out. The writing is sharp, never is it overly formulaic or mundane but understandable and real, tension is built tremendously from the dialogue alone. But above all the direction is excellent, the tone is established straight from the beginning and it is crafted to such a high quality.<br/><br/>There is rarely a dull or wasted moment throughout, the story and pacing remains tight with no parts lacking in comparison to the soaring heights. The show, as said in the title of this review, is both evocative and powerful. The some of it's parts truly do this story justice and will more than likely stir something within you that compels you to keep watching and to examine this story in much more detail. As far as crime dramas go, this feels, to a certain extent, rather fresh and different in comparison to what has come before.<br/><br/>The show looks set to keep reaching new heights and it is off a magnificent start. At first I thought who needs to see all this again but once I started watching it I was hooked. The pilot moves quickly from discovery of the bodies (and they are shown) to fleeing down the highway in the Bronco. There are so many details and people that come flooding back and it's interesting to see things put together in a quick moving episode. Lots of details are included that you won't have pictured in your mind at the time because they didn't come out all at the same time in sequence. With race, money, abuse, celebrity it's still the crime of the 20th century.<br/><br/>The A list cast is hit and miss. Cuba Gooding is an enthusiastic actor but too small in size to play OJ. He looks shorter than the other male actors around him. Should have chosen someone more physically imposing. Sarah Paulson looks enough like Marcia Clark with the wig. Surprisingly David Schwimmer as Robert Kardashian looks like him if you check out photos. John Travolta as Shapiro has some strange eyebrows but he is fascinating to watch. Selma Blair as Kris Kardashian is also a good fit. Connie Britton looks a bit too healthy to be Faye Resnick but these are all people you like to see on screen. The link with the Kardashians is quite interesting to watch.<br/><br/>Well done and very voyeuristic and entertaining. The series so far follow the O.J. Simpson trial and the Andrew Cunanan murder spree and both are hooking and must see tv. The acting is top class and storyline keeps you interested and anticipating the next episode throughout both series'. I hope there is a series 3 as both these series made me research both events after I finished. 10/10, 5/5, amazing, must see. The People v. O.J. Simpson is a look at the murder of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, for which O.J. Simpson was found not guilty.<br/><br/>For those of us who lived through every second of it, it brings back a lot of memories -- the Bronco chase, Mark Fuhrman, the verdict, and everything else in between.<br/><br/>If you are too young to remember, the O.J. trial took over the airwaves for months. It also dominated news and talk shows.<br/><br/>This is the story of the case, but also some behind the scenes drama. I'm assuming some of that is at least partially true.<br/><br/>David Schwimmer plays Robert Kardashian. Kardashian was on O.J.'s dream team for support -- thanks to the prominence of his family today, I imagine he'll be front and center. His ex-wife and children are, and I don't remember them being mentioned originally. <br/><br/>Kardashian finally decided O.J. was guilty and stopped speaking to him, even refusing to talk to O.J. when he was on his deathbed.<br/><br/>Courtney Vance sounds just like Johnnie Cochran, a brilliant attorney who was responsible for getting O.J. found "not guilty" by distracting the jury and changing the trial to one about racism. Of course, that opportunity was handed to him by Mark Fuhrman. Before Fuhrman testified, Cochran approached Chris Darden and said, "Chris, don't put that white boy on the stand." They did, and there went their case.<br/><br/>Don't ask me what John Travolta is doing. Normally he's an excellent actor. Sarah Paulson does a terrific job as Marcia Clark. Kenneth Choi is so much like Judge Ito it's scary. The casting is astonishing. You feel as if you are watching the actual people.<br/><br/>Bruce Greenwood is Gil Garcetti. When we were watching all this take place 20 years ago, this was a perfect role for Clint Eastwood. <br/><br/>There is one part where the casting seemed wrong - Cuba Gooding as O.J. He is a good actor, but unlike the rest of the cast, he does not really embody the character. O.J. is handsome and charismatic, not to mention a bigger man in stature. <br/><br/>Billy Magnusson is good as Kato. Kato got 15 minutes of fame out of the trial and milked it.<br/><br/>Some of what takes place in the film isn't quite correct, as I recall it anyway. No one called O.J. and said, "your wife Nicole has been killed." I remember that as being a big part of my belief that he was guilty. He was called and told, "Your ex-wife has been killed." Well, he had two, but somehow, he knew it was Nicole right away. As far as him asking how she was killed, he probably didn't.<br/><br/>In the beginning, the prosecution seemed to have O.J. dead to rights, with his blood on the sidewalk and the gloves showing a mix of his and the victims' DNA. But they were undergunned. And frankly, the charisma of Johnnie Cochran was overpowering. I think a lot of the jury was mesmerized by him. Chris Darden, on the other side, went to his funeral. A powerful adversary you couldn't help but admire.<br/><br/>Barry Schenk's complete ruination of Dennis Fong is considered one of the great all-time cross-examinations - here it was truncated but still powerful.This was the beginning of Schenk's Innocence Project, which has, through DNA evidence, been able to get twenty innocent people released from prison. Unfortunately it couldn't get O.J. in prison. Too new back then, I guess. But the verdict went beyond the DNA, if what went on in the jury room is to be believed. Four hours of deliberation? And why did the people who believed him guilty cave so quickly? It seems like everyone wanted to go home.<br/><br/>In the end, this trial was a big waste. Johnnie Cochran put the LAPD on trial, and as Chris Darden tells him, "They're still going to beat us, arrest us, harass us." History has proved him correct. There were people on the jury who had no intention of voting for O.J.'s guilt.<br/><br/>So other than reality shows for Faye Resnick, Kato, and Kris Jenner, a huge book deal for Marcia Clark, franchised offices for Robert Shapiro, private practice for Chris Darden (once he recovered from a near-nervous breakdown), a brain tumor for Johnnie Cochran, and more golf games for O.J., what was accomplished for Nicole and Ron Goldman?<br/><br/>The last half hour or so of the final episode has some of the most stunning moments on television, particularly the very end. Very emotional and thought-provoking.<br/><br/>I was surprised to read that some younger people had no idea O.J. played football. I don't know why I should be surprised. There are people on this site who think Gandhi was a fictional character.<br/><br/>Whether or not you're familiar with the case, the series will prove fascinating. One of the best shows I have seen in a while. There's a lot to say here about the intelligent direction, writing and overall masterful performances of a cast that mostly feels like was born to play these roles. OK, so it's about the most famous trial in US history, but it's so well done, every aspect of the show is handled extremely well. Including the ending which I thought was brilliant. We all know what happened and it's interesting to see it unfold from all the angles that were involved in this case. The highlight of the show is Sarah Paulson who plays Marcia Clark. Wow, such a fantastic performance. It's all in the eyes. You can tell this case waa very tough for her and as her character evolves throughout the season, so does her appearance in the sense that she feels more and more tired and frustrated. Everyone's great here. Travolta is fine, and he's by far the worst performance here. But still, I found it to be right between spectacular and mediocre. It's OK at best. It seems like he was going for the rich white man who goes to country clubs approach. Sometimes, he just comes across as an overacting prick who exaggeerates the way he talks and his facial expressions.The show is fantastic, overall. I loved it. This is just excellent.<br/><br/>First rate productions are the best way to attract a first rate cast. Excellent writing of course, brilliant dialogue as well as character design. Another reviewer said that it was better than the real thing - it is. I remember absolutely hating Marcia Clarke and here she is very well played and not overly done. She is very watchable - in real life I had to turn her off very often.<br/><br/>The actors Kenneth Choi and Mr. Courteny B Vance have roles of a lifetime and they are running with them. The intricacies of Judge Ito and the boundless energy and passion of Johnnie Cochran are captivating and very well casted. <br/><br/>Particularly informative is interactions between the lawyers on both sides. It is well paced and focused, it flows cleanly from one scene to another. I wish more programming could flow from FX. Great series except for Penelope Cruz. Her natural accent is way too heavy to even try to change or do any other accents. You can tell she is struggling. Plus, Dontella is awful looking in real life. I think she was a bad choice for this. Darren Criss is great! American Crime Story is such an amazing show. The acting and writing are some of the best on TV in years! The storytelling is so good that it just sucks you in and won't let go till the end! If you really want to know how good this show really is all you have to do is read through the reviews! Season 1 of this series might just be the best thing I have ever seen among TV shows. Favourites of mine have been Dexter, season 1 of True Detective, Six Feet Under, Mindhunter-and man, oh, man, does this season, "The People vs O.J. Simpson" exceed the highest standard of quality.<br/><br/>I was not familiar with the case before, so I cannot judge the accuracy or faithfulness of the writing to events as they unfolded in reality. But I can say this: no other series, ever, managed to have me hold my breath for so long waiting for the next shot, the next line, the next episode-the next *anything*.<br/><br/>The relevance of the social, cultural and political commentary is out of this world. Some moments are loud enough to get our attention, while other pivotal moments are subdued enough to keep us pondering their meaning. Every line has a point.<br/><br/>The characters are truly well rounded and developed, and the show challenges you to resonate with both sides. It shows you their humanity, not only their role in the trial. It shows you their deep motivations and reasons, so that each one of their words (in the courtroom or outside it) lands all the more heavily on your eyes, your mind.<br/><br/>I have nothing else to add. The pacing was perfect. The last episode culminated so beautifully and naturally, though I didn't want it to end. The relevance our world today is eerie, as we are now witnessing riots in the wake of George Floyd's death. Darden's words to Cochran in the final episode are still true today, though we wish they weren't. You will know this for yourself when you have finished watching this masterful first season: The People vs O. J. Simpson.. The great news for me is that SE3 is coming soon and I can't wait to watch it! SE01 and SE02 are so entertaining that they have made me believe FX series are no exception of great story-telling works (The Americans, Fargo etc). Keep going FX! I hope the series can come one after another and after all there have been many crimes worthy of adaption. We need movie about Versace and Penelope play Donatella! An incredibly interesting and captivating story based on true events. In the beginning I thought the way of storytelling a bit confusing but once you get used it, it enhances the viewing experience immensely. I can imagine watching it a second time around and then being able to fully take advantage and enjoy it even more.
Huge shoutout to the actors who gave incredible performances. Especially Darren Criss needs to be mentioned but also supporting actors such as Ricky Martin, Penelope Cruz, Finn Wittrock and particularily Cody Fern.<br/><br/>Only in relation to season 2! Pros: Great acting (even from CG Jr. as Juice which was the creators' intention to begin with); fascinating to watch
Cons: OJ, who else? Sarah Paulsen (Clark), Sterling Brown (Darden) and Courtney Vance (Cochran) are absolute stand-outs in this excellent TV series. Great writing and terrific acting. The one criticism I have is Cuba Gooding, Jr, although a wonderful actor, doesn't have the physicality required to convincingly portray O.J. Simpson. Other than that poor judgment in casting, excellent direction and production make this a series worth watching. Even if you believe you know everything about the case, you'll gain a deeper sense of the sorrow the families (and still are) lived through. And a greater respect for the district attorneys, who by no fault of their own, found themselves under the microscope while working inside a circus ring. Like Nicole and Ron - the LA District Attorney never had a chance. 2.season amazing. I love it.The actors and director did a great job.I hope they continue the same in Season 3 This is the shocking true crime story that follows the double murder case of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman, that had the black American football star and the ex husband of female victim, Orenthal James Simpson at it's center as the main suspect. He was prosecuted by the state and what followed was what was dubbed THE TRIAL OF THE CENTURY<br/><br/>American Crime Story Season 1 did a fantastic job of walking me through everything important that did and might have happened during this case. It made me feel like I was witnessing the case firsthand and that is credit to how well they captured the mood of 90's Los Angeles and the racial tensions during that time especially in the aftermath of the riots that happened a few years before this trial.<br/><br/>The show is less of a "whodunit" murder mystery and focuses more on highlighting the inner workings of a courtroom, how a case is a fought and in this particular case, how a hopeless case was salvaged by an all star team of lawyers defending O.J Simpson and eventually how the case ended up being a long circus that was actually televised in real life for the whole of America to witness live. Race card was played, mistakes were made, officials involved were personally targeted, and the case was fairly and sometimes unfairly manipulated behind the scenes in so many ways that I was just in awe at the realization that what I was watching actually took place.<br/><br/>People involved in the case were brought to lives in this show with top notch acting by a stellar cast especially Sarah Paulson who gives the performance of a lifetime. That is also credit to the showrunners and the direction they took with the show in their approach to tell this story, portraying the case like a game of chess. Just when you think one side has the upper hand, the other side throws them a curveball and you are left wondering what's going to happen next.<br/><br/>As I finished my 2 day long binge of this show, the open ended nature of the case and how it's portrayed really made me question the different angles that may have been missed or disregarded but most importantly how this case had both negative and positive implications on America in a never ending fight against racism, the impact it had on the lives of people involved and how O.J. Simpson, once a heroic figure, fell from grace, which is what makes it such a significant American Tragedy.<br/><br/>Solid 8.4/10 Honestly the best television I have ever watched. A masterpiece told in reverse, superbly acted and directed. The missing pieces of the story are filled in, in a way which gives us empathy and sympathy for all involved, helping us to understand what went wrong and that life is not black and white but grey at the edges. I was gripped. What a fascinating anthology of American Crime! Just like in AHS, you just never know where the story will take you. Up is down, and down is sideways. Just when you think it's the Mexican drug dealer, it turns out to be the rich white kid with quite a prosperous business selling Meth. It's amazing what I don't know, and you'd be surprised what you think you know. These are all true stories that I think anyone with an interest in Criminology should watch. This should be a prerequisite for all Law Enforcement Officials and EMS employees. Pax, Murf The People V. OJ Simpson - A mostly factual account of the real life event, this season is surpisingly quite an enjoyable ride. Yes, the murders themselves are brutal and the core of this movie is quite dark, however this season is mostly fun. That's not to say it should be fun necesarily, however it only pokes fun at the ridiculous nature of the trial itself, and not the actual crime. The series has great flowing camerawork, the acting is top notched and it truly is a binge worthy show. This season has been mosty talked to death so I'm mainly focusing on the second season, but I'll just briefly bring up some criticisms with the show - Travolta and Gooding. John Travolta is undoubtedly strange at first, but ultimately his weird impersonation kinda grows on me. Robert Shapiro is a weird character so it kinda works. With Cuba Gooding Jr, I do understand that if you want him to be like OJ, his performance will be disappointing. OJ is commanding, larger than life, and ultimately a lovable presence. I think Cuba gets the essence of what OJ at the time was like. And ultimately, you do feel kinda sympathetic for this guy. If you listen to the real OJ, he lacks the kinda remorse that would make you care, and although the show makes it clear he probably did do it, you still have the sympathy that makes the show intriguing. The best episode in my opinion is either the first episode or the ninth.<br/><br/>The Assassination of Gianni Versace - I know this is not a popular opinion, but I loved this season, probably more than the first. Part of the problem as to why it was less popular is clear - this is a lesser known story, the show is not nearly as binge worthy as the first season and ultimately the idea seemed kinda boring and cynical. I initially thought this random guy killed Versace because he was some sort of obsessed fan - that's the show. Little did I know how much there was to this story. Being a lesser known story made it more interesting to uncover what had happened. I had no idea who Andrew Cunanan was, and that was the fun of the show. He was a serial killer which I had no idea about. The interesting thing as well is the enigma. In the OJ case he enigma was who killed Nicole and Ron, in the Impeachment story the enigma will probably be around the morality of Bill Clinton. The enigma here is far more interesting to me - why did he do it? And although the show gives you a lot of evidence, you don't really know why. Andrew never says why he killed anyone - at least truthfully. The show also has a great soundtrack and score (esecially a lot of the musical stings for Andrew and the opening Adagio in D minor) similarly beautiful camerawork, which captures a lot more beauty than the OJ show due to the world around Andrew Cunanan. And of course, no one else can be praised more than Darren Criss. He captures both the flamboyant charm of who Andrew pretends to be, and the true sociopath that lies beneath. As less of an ensemble piece, Darren becomes the centre star, and keeps the show s engaging as it is. It should be noted that this show is not a fun experience like the OJ show - almost all of the characters in the show have a sad ending, and when we start at there lowest point and travel back to their highest, it makes the show even more sad. So don't go into this expecting to finish it in a day. However it is definitely a story I recommend exploring. The best episode in my opinion is the last one, followed closely by the second last. I really liked the People vs. OJ Simpson story, so much so that I am keen to give the Versace chapter a try despite not having nearly as much impact in pop culture as the crimes allegedly involving OJ Simpson.<br/><br/>I think everyone is familiar with the murders of Nicole Simpson and Ron Goldman and to some extent to the controversy surrounding the "trial of the century" - this mini-series aims to be a real depiction of the events that take place from the murders onwards, based on book by reporter Jeffrey Toobin: "The Run of his Life: the People vs OJ Simpson".<br/><br/>Part of the success stems from the way it captures the
<ul><li>the swings in public opinion based on the evidence presented at the trial</li><li>the unprecedented media circus surrounding said trial and just how much pressure that creates for those involved</li><li>the very palpable racial tension underlying every step of the way</li><li>does all this and still you very "personally" connected to the people portrayed</li></ul><br/><br/>Can't help but think some of its success is related to the involvement of writer Ryan Murphy (Nip Tuck, Glee), now on a 5y contract with Netflix.<br/><br/>Overall a great watch, compelling and ideal if you heard about OJ Simpson but really don't know much details around the crime. I have never seen something so perfect and engaging. From A-Z its Excellent The first season about OJ was ok, but the story of andrew cunanan of the assassination of giani versace left me speechless. The acting and how the story was told and directed created of the the greatest masterpiece of all time I have just finished watching Season 2 (The Assassination of Gianni Versace). I think this series has high production quality -- it looks gorgeous and the music pumps up the drama to operatic heights -- and good performances from the well-cast actors. Darren Criss, Edgar Ramirez and Penelope Cruz stand out. Judith Light is also compellingly brittle as Marilyn Miglin, who comes off as the Queen of Da Nile. The director uses the technique of cutting back and forth in time to reveal the motivations of the various individuals (mainly Versace's killer Andrew Cunanan), but this I found this annoying as the series went on. Like, get on with it! I also grew weary of the showmakers' obvious attempts to make the viewer pity Cunanan, and to almost beg you to excuse his brutal murders because his dad was a lying jerk and he wasn't as rich or socially successful as he thought he should be. I will give this series credit for showing how vicious Cunanan's acts were--they don't sugar-coat it too much--but viewers should be fully aware that the show's writers fill in gaping holes in the evidence with speculation, romanticized dream sequences (which I found questionable in taste considering they involve real-life murder victims who cannot speak for themselves), and just plain fiction. So enjoy "The Assassination of Gianni Versace" for what it is--dramatic, lurid TV opera loosely based on real events--and do not expect the full, true story of what happened. This is based on Jeffrey Toobin's account, "The Run Of His Life," about the murder trial of the African-American O. J. Simpson and the events leading up to it. But this film diverges from the mostly legal and characterological view that Toobin took at the time. It adds some things, intimate conversations, solitary acts, some of them certainly fabricated, and eliminates some of Toobin's more cynical observations.<br/><br/>In plain English, what appears to have happened is this. Simpson, an award-winning football player, admired and befriended by the Los Angeles Police Department, had a history of brutalizing his wife, the white Nicole.<br/><br/>One night, a dog-walker discovered the mutilated bodies of Nicol Simpson and a stranger who had happened on the scene. The police had no particular difficulty in building the case against O. J. Simposon, based on physical evidence. A earlier recorded 911 call from Nicole, while Simpson shouted threats in the background, was found. A blood trail led to Simpson's home in another part of L.A. DNA evidence was stacked against him -- his blood mixed with Nicole's was found on a pair of socks in Simpson's bedroom. A similar DNA mix was found on one glove at the murder scene and another glove on Simpson's residence. Simpson was seen by a witness speeding his white Bronco on the shortest route between the murder scene and his own house.<br/><br/>The physical evidence was conclusive. Or rather, conclusive to everyone except the jury, who heeded Defense Counsel Johnny Cochran's plea to "send a message to the police" by acquitting O. J. Simpson, which they did.<br/><br/>The trial was covered comprehensively by the manic media. To me, the most disheartening scene was a clip of law students at Howard University, a traditionally black school, when the verdict of not guilty was announced. The students leaped for joy, cheering and hugging each other. And these were law students.<br/><br/>As for the film itself, it's pretty well done with a couple of exceptions. Much time is given over to David Schwimmer, as Bob Kardashian, the lawyer who was a close friend of Simpson's. He always referred reverently to him as "the Juice." But, in a way, Kardashian's role in the narrative may be small but he is a fulcrum point on which the moral message turns. As the evidence accumulates, even Kardashian, the most loyal of lawyers and the oldest of friends, realizes that Simpson is a shallow man and a murderer.<br/><br/>As Johnny Cochran, the ever smooth Courtney Vance is phenomenal. He sees from the beginning that the trial is about race, even though Simpson had long ago lost touch with the black community. "I'm here to win," he announces with a grin. Stephen Brown as the thoughtful and sensitive Chris Darden is almost as good. Unfortunately he proved not such a hot lawyer, what with the spontaneous glove business. The film suggests that Clark was open to a closer relationship with Darden. I wonder where that information came from.<br/><br/>Sarah Paulsen pulls off her role as the uber-confident Marcia Clark convincingly. When things go awry, it's touching to see her alone at night, puffing on a cigarette in her back yard because her children are inside the house and -- you know, second hand smoke? One whiff and your growth is forever stunted. And, as we learn, she truly loved her kids. Kenneth Choi looks and sounds so much like Judge Lance Ito that I had the eerie feeling that it WAS Ito performing under a nom de cinema.<br/><br/>In the minus column is Cuba Gooding as O. J. His inability to fill the role wouldn't be so noticeable if we weren't already familiar with the original. Simpson had a fluid baritone voice. He was tall, built like a football player, an unpretentious but impressive persona. Gooding has a good physical presence but he's of normal height and his voice squeaks.<br/><br/>John Travolta is amusing as Robert Shapiro, who began as lead lawyer but, being a white man, was sent to the bench and replaced by the somewhat darker and more slithery Johnny Cochran. Travolta plays Shapiro with his chin stuck out and his nose in the air and a superior tone of voice. It's a parody of a high-end lawyer, but then Shapiro wasn't too distant from Travolta's vision.<br/><br/>Too bad for L.A., too bad for the prosecutor, too bad for America, that the racial divide that was pointed out long ago by visitors like Alexis de Toqueville and Gunnar Myrdal seems to be almost as stark now as it was then. Simpson wound up in jail anyway for a different offense. He'll be eligible for parole next year. This show is brilliant.<br/><br/>I just finished watching the premiere, and I am blown away by its sophistication and complexity. Ryan Murphy is a masterful director. He has succeeded, so far, in handling the varying issues of the case with sympathy and truth. The show captures the complete essence of 1990's and has a very professional look and feel. <br/><br/>The racial tensions at the time, blended with the austerity of the case, OJ's celebrity, the naiveté of the prosecution, and the madness of the media, are all captured here. The actors are at the top of their game. Sarah Paulson embodies Marcia Clark. She is overworked, ambitious, idealistic, and unaware of what she is up against. I envision a future Emmy nomination for Paulson. Her portrayal is spot on, and allows the viewer to empathize with Clark- who was unfairly portrayed by the media at the time. Cuba Gooding Jr. and John Travolta are all standouts here as well. <br/><br/>Some of the message boards have criticized Selma Blair's acting. I, however, think she has done a great job of capturing the vanity and nuance of Kris Jenner. In the short airtime she has in episode one, I think she has done a great job of playing a flawed and well known figure. I cannot wait to see how the show will deal with Faye Resnick, Detective Mark Fuhrman, and the rest of the key players in the case, and in the media. <br/><br/>For now, I am hooked. This is a definite must watch. Incredible, season 2 is brilliant and a story you wouldn't fathom could be true. The direction is stunning which underpins the horror. I would say season 2 is the polar opposite of the OJ season, but in the most positive senses the word. It's really more of a character portrait and a study of homophobia in the 90's over a courtroom and media circus. Straight off the bat, is this The People vs O.J Simpson or a Origin story for Keeping up with the Kardashian's? I watched the 1st episode with true excitement. The cast names traveling the screen was like a IMDb top 50 list. it started well until we meet David Schwimmer's "Bobby Kardashian", his monotone delivery and facial expressions baffled me. Travolta as Shapiro will haunt my nightmares for years to come, bad delivery, even worse make-up. Sitting with my American girlfriend, even she didn't have a clue as to what was going on. Cuba isn't actually half bad, although if I hear the word "Juice" again I will probably have to go to the toilet, as I felt I was watching a Minute Maid commercial. Now the Kardashian angle is my biggest turn off. Why the need to have Selma Blair at all baffled me, the "kids" running around at the funeral and the constant need to throw in the Kardashian name at every opportunity. Then to top it all off you have the Pubescent KKK SPELLING their name. S-E-R-I-O-U-S-L-Y?? I will continue to watch, just through plain intrigue, but this needs to focus more on O.J and less on the hangers on who found fame through their Father. It's one of those shows I'd not heard of, but happened to find and thought could be an interesting way to pass an hour or two.<br/><br/>Sadly, the only thing one wants to do after watching two episodes of this is pass out from bored, loathing and sheer horror at the terrible acting, script, kardashians everywhere, and John Travolta's bad plastic surgery, mannerisms acting.<br/><br/>In the two episodes I've seen there has been nothing new put on the table in terms of the story other than details that are in the main available elsewhere you might want to look. Cuba Gooding Jnr is performing about as badly as everyone else in terms of acting, and as others suggests he is simply unconvincing as OJ given he is seeming a foot shorter than everyone else, which of course OJ wasn't.<br/><br/>The Robert Kardashian character (David Schwimmer) proves without doubt how the entire Kardashian clan are so completely vile, other than the not great acting yet again, he is just an annoying, whiny bitch and the flashabouts to his equally horrid family are just annoying. This is a man who should have been locked up years ago for just being himself, ideally it would have happened long before any of the Kardashian children were made, but alas, wishful thinking.<br/><br/>The shows plays into all the stereotypes - black actors screaming, ranting and raving all about the place about racism, prejudice and the injustices of the LAPD and the world at large, white lawyers with Merceded Benz's in nice houses with frustrated looking wives, and a whole plethora of standaround hangeron types that I imagine would be the sort of people someone like OJ did associate with.<br/><br/>My suspicion is the kardashians were financing this rubbish because I fail to see how any sensible production company would greenlight the finances for it - in a world full of poverty, famine, war, crime etc, I can only imagine the Kardashians are narcissists enough to get something as bad as this made.<br/><br/>If you're really bored, and are contemplating a night of slashing your wrists versus watching TV and this show is on, I'd probably go with the former option. It really is that bad. Everyone remembers the mid 90's 1994 and 1995 and how they were glued with the culture and happenings of the O.J. Simpson murder case. And the criminal trial televised live on TV would fascinate and captivate a whole nation as did he do it, and the trial would spin on to race, police cover up and evidence tampering. I must say that this new FX series captures all of that near perfect. As the chemistry between the characters in is top notch form. As the actors playing the real life players look so real as the mannerisms are captured just perfect. And it shows how the defense team plots to make the trial about race and evidence tampering, and behind the scenes you see the power struggle with O.J. defense lawyers. And you see the head strong Marcia Clark make legal blunders and the real life news footage shown takes you back to the media circus of the trial of the century. Overall this series is near addictive watch it it's entertaining and a behind the scenes joy of the most talked about murder case of our generation. I honestly don't get it. <br/><br/>First of all, let me just say: I really wanted this to be good... Honestly! I mean, we're all fascinated by the original story, so it obviously had potential. We're two episodes in at this point and I don't even know where to start. <br/><br/>I guess my first question is: why on earth are so many of you in awe of this show? I'm beginning to suspect that I'm center stage in some sort of version of "The Truman Show". Why? Because this production is a complete farce! Quite simply a parody of epic proportions! <br/><br/>First of all: the atrocious plug-fest of the Kardashian-family is the most embarrassing thing I've seen on TV since I can remember and the numerous "dramatic" fast close-ups looks completely ridiculous, but it's not just that. Literally every line uttered on "American Crime Story" is so cliché it hurts... The acting is downright laughable across the board, but there's honestly no need to blame the actors. They're doing the very best they can with a script that reeks to high heaven. The telenovela-style directing obviously doesn't help either. <br/><br/>But still, most of you seem to love it... Are standards slipping? Are reviewers "forced" or paid to praise certain shows? I don't know.<br/><br/>What I do know is that this could've been a top notch criminal drama. It could've had us on the edge of our seats despite the fact that we know the outcome, but no... It's a soap opera of the lowest possible standard. <br/><br/>By all means; the sets look nice, the production value is good, the resemblance to real-life characters is not bad, despite the obvious point that Cuba is a bit too small. Maybe he should've borrowed the box that his former co-star Tom Cruise uses to stand on to see eye-to-eye with his co-stars? However, like I said, that's not the problem! The script is simply ridiculous. I can't emphasize this enough! It's truly so over-the-top that it feels like a parody skit!<br/><br/>Now, of course: I have to continue watching to see if A) it gets better or B) it gets worse... I'm having a hard time picturing how it can get worse, but hey... We'll soon find out! In the meanwhile, let's all chant: "Kardashian, Kardashian, Kardashian"... and then throw up! I really wanted to like this show. I've read so many good reviews by many well-respected media outlets and I cannot figure out why. This script is so cheesy and just ridiculous. I have a legal background and cannot keep track of the legal blunders....hugely distracting already. Also, why does John Travolta's mouth seem to be almost completely wired shut? Shapiro didn't, and doesn't, talk that way! That's a mannerism that would be more appropriate in an SNL sketch....not in a serious drama. I'm utterly disappointed. <br/><br/>On a final note....please FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, STOP plugging the Kardashian kids every chance you get. They do NOT belong in this storyline anywhere and it makes me want to vomit. Just stop and try to stick to the facts....and get some video footage for John Travolta to study. Cuba Gooding Jr. as O.J. Simpson??? Really??? Who on earth was in charge of casting? Mr Gooding bears no resemblance at all to Mr Simpson, apart from being an African-American His facial structure is all wrong, very different from O.J. who had a most strikingly handsome and distinctive face. Jamie Fox would have been an excellent choice, I feel. <br/><br/>Gooding's acting is very hammy, over-the-top, at times silly. <br/><br/>Travolta is the big surprise in this series, developing his role strongly and masterfully. Kudos! On the other hand, Schwimmer comes across as weak and pitiful at times, but generally about passable -- I keep seeing him as Ross in "Friends", which doesn't help. <br/><br/>The car chase occupied one entire episode, plainly ridiculous. <br/><br/>Overall, a slightly below-par effort, but watchable. Season 2 A perfect 10 for 10! <br/><br/>This was not only great casting by the film producers in selecting versatile actor Edgar Ramírez as Gianni Versace and his serial killer Andrew Cunanan, played by TV star of Glee (2010-2015) fame, Darren Criss, but all the other key people in Gianni Versace's life. Versace's partner Antonio D'Amico, played by singing sensation Ricky Martin, and Versace's sister Donatella Versace, played by Penélope Cruz, provided the audience with how real and how tragic this crime really was.<br/><br/>Gianni Versace loved living in Miami and he also loved being able to walk down the street to his favorite local cafe to drink coffee and read the newspaper, and when he felt like it talk to the locals. As a designer of fine clothes and a fashion legend, Gianni was at the top of his game. <br/><br/>Even the police and FBI agents assigned to the case were all selected for this mini series for their specific parts with obvious care. If I compare this mini series to some of the crappy character selections such as in the current TV series S.W.A.T., or Criminal Minds, where everyone of the starring roles is provided to an attractive under 35 actor/actress, these shows rely on eye candy and not on content.<br/><br/>Actor Edgar Ramírez is a true chameleon who shows in this mini series how superb a character actor he actually is who dives deep into the great role of Gianni Versace, playing the designer with both elegance and display for the love of the people that surrounded him continuously. Darren Criss who plays the serial killer Andrew Cunanan, was blessed with good looks and an ability to lie his way "in and out" of any situation as he so chose. <br/><br/>These men have lived two lives that could not be anymore different. Their sexuality is what they have in common. One man, Versace is world renowned, a gifted fashion designer and is loved by everyone. The other man Cunanan, had humble beginnings but desired to live a rich and privileged lifestyle without having to work for anything.<br/><br/>The senseless point blank and intentional targeted murder of Gianni Versace by Andrew Cunanan, initiated an international media frenzy, and one of the largest police investigations in the U.S. to make an arrest before serial killer Andrew Cunanan could/would kill again.<br/><br/>This mini-series provides its audience with a significant historical adaptation of the events leading up to Versace's murder and the events leading up to the eventual capture of serial killer Andrew Cunanan. The screenplay is excellent, the story which as any good historical series should be able to do seamlessly flips between past and present situations that occurred. I cannot say enough about the entire cast who deliver their parts with a realism seldom seen which portrays the real life characters they are portraying.<br/><br/>Kudos to the entire production company, the screenwriters, the various directors who sewed the scenes together, and the actors/actresses who dived into their individual roles with a heart felt love for the real life people they were paid to portray. I cannot wait until this mini-series is released as a Blu Ray special edition.<br/><br/>A perfect 10 for 10! Whatever critics say, this season indisputably has one thing - it has style. It's provocative. It has enough truth to it to make it believable and enough lies to make it memorable. That's exactly how legends are made. This is horrible. Schwimmer is horrible, Travolta is ridiculous and Cuba Gooding is just plain bad. I almost keep thinking it's a parody of the trial and not the dramatic biography that it is suppose to be. I love Travolta and Cuba Gooding (normally) but this may be their worse acting yet, neither is right for the role and Schwimmer really just ruins it for me. I really think if they had maybe 3 unknown actors to play these roles, it may have been a bit better. Travolta is trying way too hard to look and behave like Shapiro and it just ruins it for me.<br/><br/>Too much "Kardashian" pushing this. It always amazed me that their claim to fame was because their dad was friends with a murderer. Our wonderful society..... And, I'm not sure if it's Schwimmer's horrible acting or true, but Kardashian basically puts OJ on a pedestal, but why?? What did Kardashian get out of it?? Just the license to say he was friends with OJ Simpson?? Ridiculous.<br/><br/>I am shocked at how many viewers are praising this. I'm watching because of Sarah Paulson and Courtney Vance. They are making it watchable. I cannot say enough things about this show with the long Title, Ryan Murphy has done it again and this time in my opinion struck gold, I love the way the story was told and more specifically I love the way Darren Criss played the role of "Andrew" this guy is gonna go places, this actor was able to play every emotion and played it all masterfully and perfectly, as of this writing I know he already won an Emmy and a Golden Globe, to me it's not enough praise for this actor. Darren Criss is going to be a name that's going to be remembered mark my words!!! I cannot say enough about him, just watch this show and see what this guy did, it's remarkable. Now to the rest of the cast, Edgar Ramirez was nothing short of amazing also in the role of "Gianni" and I also have to mention another up and coming actor his name is Cody Fern he played the role of "David" and let me tell you he played fear and pain so perfectly he should get an award for his performance as well. Every actor in this series was amazing don't get me wrong, but those three were phenomenal. The show looked great, the cinematography and music was also great, just watch this show People I can go on and on about how great it is, but I'm gonna stop here. Season 1 was fantastic, season 2 was dreadfully slow placed and just plain boring. Look, only one episode in, but man is this show ever hilarious. The show looks great from a production standpoint. The writing however makes the affair feel somewhat amateurish. About 3/4 of the way through the first episode, in a 5 minute period, I jotted down these three events that literally had me laughing out loud. While Marcia Clark and her cohort are questioning potential witnesses, there are two consecutive witnesses who seem to incriminate OJ. In both cases the "oh my god, he's guilty look" they give each other is absolutely hysterical. The only opportunity missed in the moment was the sweeping Duh...Duh...Duh orchestral score. What a shame, it would have been perfect! Then within 2 minutes, we're at the funeral when Faye Resnick and Kris K decide they must divulge in the most ridiculous expository conversation ever overheard at a funeral. Faye: "Did you ever see the pictures of her face after he laid into her...and you know she hid them away, just in case something happened?" No Faye, her closest friend in the whole world had no idea about that, but we just needed to make sure the audience was in on it. Then mere seconds later when a paparazzi asks "Who the hell brings their lawyer to a funeral?" It comes across as soooo corny. Yeah, we get it writers, he's sure acting guilty. So I say, adjust your lens, if you view it as comedy, we may have a classic for the ages!!! The People vs O.J. Simpson is one of the most accurate reconstruction series I have ever seen. The actual events this is based on are so incredible and controversial that it would take some monumentally great writing and acting to do it justice. Thankfully the show delivers handsomely on both counts. Some of the casting choices are just perfect, particularly Sara Paulsen as Marcia Clark and Courtney B Vance as Johnnie Cochran. The writing is incredible and, while I do feel that this could have been a couple of hours shorter overall, the pacing is excellent.<br/><br/>The one major downside though, is the bizarre decision to cast Cuba Gooding Jr as O.J. Simpson. Not only is there virtually zero physical resemblance, Gooding also fails to capture any of the charm, power and arrogance of Simpson. Funnily enough I think Dwayne Johnson, with his physicality and alpha-male persona, would actually have been perfect for this role. Regardless, the inclusion of Gooding is a spectacularly poor piece of casting and it heavily detracts from the overall quality of this series.<br/><br/>Paulsen's performance, however, is very special indeed. The show rests largely on her shoulders and she portrays Marcia Clark with an amazing level of sensitivity. She is ably assisted by the excellent Sterling K. Brown who himself turns in a surprisingly accurate portrayal of Christopher Darden. I was also very impressed by John Travolta who captured his complex subject Robert Shapiro incredibly well. I have always found it difficult to watch David Schwimmer outside of Friends as he just looks, speaks and acts like Ross at all times, but he did grow on me as this show progressed. In many ways, Robert Kardashian is the one of the heroes of this story and Schwimmer does a decent job of showcasing his torment.<br/><br/>The outcome of the trial still makes my head spin and watching this show was quite difficult as a result. The issues regarding race politics, jury manipulation and institutional sexism are very confronting and are handled very well by the writers. I couldn't be much more impressed with this production and, Cuba Gooding Jr aside, this would rank as one of the better true crime shows I have seen. Conceptually, it fails because when you have the most documented and talked about crime in American history, reenacting it cannot contain drama since there cannot be any surprises unless you contain new information or a biased slant. This show does neither. JFK the movie, for example, worked because it incorporated all the conspiracy theories into one coherent movie, it was a unique statement on an overexposed part of our history. The People v. O.J. Simpson, contains almost nothing that hasn't been repeated ad nauseam for decades.<br/><br/>The script is lifeless. Even the best actors can't infuse life into it and there are some great actors trying desperately to give the script CPR and looking ridiculous in the process. David Schwimmer is mesmerizingly bad. It is like watching a comedian die on stage and while you are cringing and feel pity for him, it is hard not to watch him implode. In a bad show, the quality plummets instantly the second he says a line. He's not a dramatic actor. It's Ross being comedically bad at acting. Cuba Gooding Jr is a decent actor trying too hard to raise the quality of the show by himself. No lead could make a show with such a huge cast good by himself, and Cuba's acting looks contrived and unconvincing as OJ, somewhat because physically he is so miscast. OJ's presence was partly due to the way he looked, he was a big man with perfectly chiseled looks, Cuba can't fill his shoes. The repeated cutaways to the Kardashians is a desperate and tacky way to stay topical that always is a sharp break from the narrative. I had high hopes for this series as I believed it would accurately portray to the best of it's ability the story and trial of OJ Simpson. I was only 4 years old when this took place and As a true crime enthusiast, I didn't know much about the true story. So far I'm not impressed. The portrayal and the over hype of the "Kardashians" is tacky and disgusting. It makes me cringe every time one of the Kardashian children is shown in this TV show. They were kids at the time who had no real part in this story. Shame on you Ryan Murphy for using their name to promote a TV show. This show could be great, and I hope out improved and continues to portray accurate true crime stories. For now I'll watch it until I find something better on TV. Cuba Gooding Jr not the best choice for the role but the whole thing failed for me because of John Travolta's ridiculous makeup, fake teeth that he couldn't work with properly and sniff the fart acting (Joey, Friends). Don't think I heard a word he said because of it and couldn't take my eyes off him whether he was speaking or not and not in a good way. Unknown actors would have been better for every role.<br/><br/>That's pretty much all I needed to say but I need to post 10 lines apparently. Not much I can say about the murders that you don't already know and not much new stuff came out so I think the only interesting part of this mini series is to see how the actors handle it. To me it seemed that the well known actors fared worse. The first show of 2016 that could stick around for the top ten list of the year is The People v. OJ Simpson. The look of it is similar to American Horror Story as it's also on FX. The show has movie quality to it with actors from the big and small screen coming together, all of them appear at the top of their game. <br/><br/>The performance that most of this hinges on is Cuba Gooding Jr. as OJ Simpson. The accent and demeanor were strange at first but Gooding's acting chops really pay off when the emotions start pouring out. I've not decided on this performance but I can see good things coming as the season progresses.<br/><br/>Continuing with the cast members, John Travolta plays the lawyer Robert Shapiro with a particular sliminess and gusto that Travolta often brings to his roles. Another interesting performance is Robert Kardashian played by David Schwimmer. The cultural impact of the Kardashian family is not left untouched and several lines mention the now famous daughters.<br/><br/>After the finale: I was hooked from the first episode of this new anthology series on FX. American Crime Story kicks off with one of the most controversial cases in American with The People v. OJ Simpson. The story was already compelling but the presentation was engaging and the production very high quality. The acting was ranged from excellent to pretty good, and the story telling never ceased to be entertaining. <br/><br/>Cuba Gooding Jr. played the title character OJ Simpson ranging from emotionally stricken to glorified and ecstatic over his verdict. Gooding took on the role that could only be performed by a veteran actor and continues the growing trend of movie actors moving to high production television. I will be curious to see how the critics review him later in the year and with awards in the hindsight.<br/><br/>Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com Well, the jury is out. I've just seen the first two episodes. But if this is a prelude of what's to come, the raving reviews from the 25 or so who have responded thus far seem to be coming from the paid hacks and shills and cheerleaders of the series.<br/><br/>Jeeze! I was watching real time of the O.J. chase, the arrest, the trial, etc. This series, so far, seems to be fabricating stuff out of thin air. Can you imagine the defense attorneys REALLY relating what they were thinking at the time? Or, Marsha Clark, who never looked so good with her new hairdo just for the series? Ugh! I was hoping for a rather authentic document-drama. Not this bunch of hype, tripe and fake made-for-TV drama.<br/><br/>If I can stand watching a few more episodes, I can't wait to see how they treat Judge Lance Ito. This has got to be one of the worst television events I have ever seen and, believe me, I watch a lot of television. The acting from every single cast member is cringe worthy and the casting of Cuba Gooding Jr is hard to fathom, he's whiny, tiny and sniveling in almost every scene, it's hard to believe he has an Oscar. David Schwimmer is equally as pathetic and is used as a vehicle to drive the God awful Kardashian clan needlessly into the action. it's like watching what Ross from friends did after the rest of them moved on. Hateful. The script is shocking and you can literally see people waiting for their cue for their next line. It dampens the seriousness of the race relation difficulties by forcing this down our throat at every given opportunity and portrays almost every black character as shouty and angry. I really don't want to watch anymore but cannot drag myself away from the comical horror show of it all. If you decide to watch be prepared to watch the Kardashian devil spawn sing a song about their name ( I nearly punched myself in the face just to lessen the irritation ) and to hate the word juice forever more. OJ himself has less to be ashamed of than the people who contributed to this cinematic disaster. <br/><br/>The first episode is the expected true crime drama tripe but with A & B -list actors. Absolutely wooden performances by Travolta & Schwimmer and Cuba is trying so hard you half expect him to turn to camera and remind us that he won an Oscar 2 decades ago. <br/><br/>All the sensationalist boxes are checked on this one... it's like looking through the tabloids of the checkout aisle in the 90s.<br/><br/>Marcia Clark's chain smoking and divorce The obligatory scene with the Kardashian children running through the funeral. Mark Fuhrman's issues Kato! (stoned and stupid) etc... <br/><br/>If you like trash TV... then this may be for you, if not this is to be avoided. Im only giving this show a 2 out of 10 for the simple fact it may prompt a younger generation to spend some time researching the actual events .... Trust me from the beginning to the end the real thing is SOOOO much better, instead of clouding your mind with little tidbits of false information... I must admit it re-sparked my interest in the whole thing and i binge watched the whole "real" thing as closely as i could to how anyone watching it on live TV would have. Why watch a show u have to wait for when the main points already happened minus the terrible acting among other inaccuracies. Thats all i have to say about this, it could of been a lot better To me this series is a joke. You can see it anyways in each episode every actor laughs Simpson especially after his arrest a lot. Why on earth such a strong real life scenario was directed like this? Why Travolta has to prove that he is old and his acting so bad? He is like gather all actors and shoot in one day.And this with his hand habit should be a remain of dancing!!!Why lawyers are presented as a Gang? Why Simpson is acting like on vacation? Why......? 0/20. Plot? Ha!Travolta tests evidence gloves with bare hands Then everyone is wearing protective gloves not to destroy evidence!!!I hope and wish another series to give good answers This is a negative review. No spoilers here. This show is a waste of air time / space. Created account today just to warn you how bad it really is. How can this show get any good reviews. Has anyone watched it? Must be show's staff writing the positive reviews... This played out in real time on live TV and that coverage was more interesting. Guilt or innocence aside why watch this misery? Can't Hollywood produce something more entertaining? I'm curious to see who actually liked this junk made for TV docudrama. Sky TV has had it's fair amount of lemons but this is the worst drivel. I was expecting more from American TV producers. Enjoyed both seasons very much, the first slightly more so.<br/><br/>'People vs. O.J. Simpson' benefits from its fascinating true story, filled with twists, turns, unpredictability and suspense. The scope is sprawling, exploring many interesting characters, as well as America's reaction to the trial. The racial issues are excellently navigated, encouraging the viewer to think for themselves. The show never feels like it is pushing a political message. Overall, a very well made and highly engaging season of television.<br/><br/>The second season is also very enjoyable, though not quite as much as the first season. 'Assassination of Gianni Versace' is a misleading title; the series focuses on Versace's killer, Andrew Cunanan, exploring his killing spree, and the events leading up to it. Homophobia is the issue explored here, and once again, very powerfully. This season feels slightly narrower in scope, focusing mainly on one character, to some detriment.<br/><br/>Still, the writing, directing and acting in both seasons is fantastic. The show always feels very authentic to its time period, yet never dated; it is complex and dramatic in a modern way. One of the better television programs I've ever seen. I love the whole story of S1 And S2 a perfect stories and acting I Hope S3 will be coming Soon you should watch it! A star-studded cast, a plot to die for (if your name is Nichole or Ronald) and a budget big enough to recreate the fashions of the time. The first failing is the script. Trite and obvious. And totally lacking in any venom or surprises.Yes, we all know how it ends, but most have forgotten the surprises that came along the way. The Bronco chase was just silly, frustrating and utterly unbelievable. The second is the miscasting. I love Cuba but he is too small, too cheeky and not the least bit threatening. When he tries to look dangerous he looks like a toddler having a tantrum. Hey, OJ is a cold-blooded killer. We SHOULD be frightened of him. Instead I giggled. Since Pulp Fiction, I have pretty much been a fan of Travolta. He is a great actor and quite the chameleon. In this, however, he just looks old, bewildered and like a poster boy for not having cosmetic surgery. Schwimmer? Oh dear. If he is out of his depth in a piece of fluff like Friends, how can he be expected to shine in a highly charged, highly emotional and downright scary docudrama? He comes across as gormless and wet. Finally, the directing. That should be the lack of direction. When they sat down to work out what they wanted to do, I would have hoped someone would have said "This is the result we want to see out of this series". That could have been to explain how (really how?) was it possible for OJ to be convicted, or how the police actually fabricated evidence against him or that the prosecuting was so far out of her depth that she should never have been put on the case.. anything really. Instead we have a chronology of events interspersed with bad dialogue and bad acting. I didn't bother watching after the second episode. I can't stand watching this. I'm sure it's a beautifully -made series and it does have a great cast, but the only sections I can watch without squirming (and puking) are the behind-the-scenes sections involving the police and the LA judicial system. The sequences involving OJ, his lawyers, handlers, family, posse, and hangers-on, and their interactions with each other and the press&public, are so overblown and overdrawn that half of me can't believe it and the other half is revolted. Are celebrities (and their pilot fish, the celebrity lawyers, celebrity agents and celebrity "business associates")really this mawkish, clannish, fawning and maternal toward each other? The Us-v-them situation is clearly established, but is there no one among the celebrities who sees the situation as it is? That OJ might have actually murdered his ex-wife? The closest any character comes to offering a realistic aside to the audience is when the celebrity lawyer reads OJ's "suicide" note, shakes his head in disbelief and says: "who signs a suicide note with a Happy Face?" Maybe I'm missing the point, and the first presentation of the pro-OJ faction is simply to point out their circle-the wagons, above-the-law attitude, but the way it's been done here, this member of the audience wants nothing further to do with them. Yech. 'nuff said. American Crime Story: The People vs. OJ Simpson -- From the creators of the mediocre and always disappointing miniseries American Horror Story? That's what I thought when I began to see ads and promotions for this series. What I thought was a unnecessary vapid idea actually turned out as a gripping and outstanding drama series. This series had definitely caught me off guard. What an outstanding and fresh new series we've have got. So far, the episodes are fast paced, excellent and well executed. The editing is spot on, the direction for each episode is good and the series easily has one of the best screenplay on television today and (from my knowledge) does a tremendous job doing reenactments of the actual incidents. <br/><br/>But who am I kidding? The best aspect about this show are the characters who are brought to life by the incredible performances by each of the cast members. Most notably are David Schwimmer and John Travolta. Granted, we are only two episodes in, but the two give outstanding performance and are sure to be nominated (and who knows? Perhaps win?) for numerous awards for supporting actor(s) in a miniseries come Emmy's and the GGs. But of course, the man who easily steals the show is none other than Cuba Gooding Jr. as OJ Simpson, who gives a marvelous and intelligent performance not seen since........ well Rod Tidwell in Jerry Maguire.<br/><br/>The only aspect I seem to dislike about the series are the cameos given to kid-version Kim Kardashian and and kid-version Khloe Kardashian. Coming from a man who despises the sad creation that is Keeping Up with the Kardashians, I see no reason for constantly bringing back these children. In no way do they help progress the story forward, so the only reason I could think of the children to be in the show is for their publicity bought by there $$$. Despite this, ACS: The People vs OJ Simpson is a great new series and highly recommend it.<br/><br/>I highly anticipate what crime event American Crime Story will dramatize after season 1! Intelligently showed how manipulative-with-a-purpose Cunanan was and a little background from his early life. A smart crime series, with again, the complex characters and just perfect amount of dramatic touches. Hands down to this one! My greatest quibble with this series is just that it's inherently exploitative.
Otherwise it's excellent in virtually every respect.<br/><br/>I have not seen season one, but I've just watched season two.<br/><br/>If the aim was to show us how the killer could choose to do what he did
While not excusing his choices one bit I think it had some success .<br/><br/>Many people are troubled and angry in many ways.
To me choosing to kill often comes down to incredible selfishness.
The killer wants to kill so he does without truly caring about how such would effect others
including the victim.
This is to me the main thing what separates a seemingly regular guy from a killer-
In other words it's the choice taken to kill-
The action itself-
Which defines the difference.
And I think that's played out here.<br/><br/>The going back in time set up was very powerful in this story .<br/><br/>The sets were fabulous. Versace's home is a character in itself. Amazing. Totally amazing!! Most deserving of all awards won I appreciated this 2018 season of American Crime Story more than anticipated. The writing supercedes most other series, because the writers doggedly escavate the background of each lead character. And what they reveal is fascinating. The story carries on at a nice pace, and thankfully it is absent of the redundancy which most series are plagued with. The direction, production design, and editing were also well done.<br/><br/>Darren Criss was quite convincing in the lead -- in fact, he was scary-good. This year, I'm happy to discover his fine work, along with Richard Madden (starred in another series, "Bodyguard") -- both are attractive in a typical way, which can limit the viewer's perceptions of their range... but they both blew it out of the water. Criss is deservedly winning various awards.<br/><br/>The rest of the Versace cast is quite committed, yet I felt the role of Donatella could have gone to someone like Lady Gaga (3/4 Italian). She is blessed with ample passion and vocal prowess -- I'm sure if she spoke (English) with an Italian accent, it would have been thoroughly convincing. Penelope tried her hardest, but I found that her natural Spanish accent was distracting. I've watched season 1 and just about done with season 2 and I cannot believe how good this show is. I love American Horror Story but I think this is even better since the storytelling is incredible, especially season 2 since they kind of go backwards. I also think they get amazing, realistic actors so all around this show is top notch in every way. For both seasons so far they've been really good. And amazing writing. Let me start by saying that I absolutely love this show. It's intense beyond belief. It's riveting. It's powerful.<br/><br/>Now let me say this: It's already obvious that this show's quality will largely depend on which season you are watching. Season 1 was darn near perfect. Season 2 was good, but not even close to how good Season 1 was.<br/><br/>In short, I say this television show is very much worth your time. Even if you just watch select seasons that interest you. I will also say that Season 1 is definitely must-watch television. <br/><br/>Given this IS an anthology series, you could totally get away with watching only the seasons that interest you, especially since it's clear that the quality largely will depend on the story.<br/><br/>Even if you aren't familiar with the cases, it's still excellent television. For much of the time, it will keep you on the edge of your seat. I can guarantee it.<br/><br/>If you are familiar with the case, but don't exactly see the sense in watching a something and already knowing how it ends, I say give it a try. You might be surprised. I was hesitant at first, but I was pleasantly surprised -- just like you might be! You won't know unless you try. <br/><br/>As a whole, I give "American Crime Story" an 8.5/10. This show should just be renamed " the Rob Kardashian story" It makes more Kim references than anything else. This show is solely made to remind people who he was.. not important. you can tell there are other motives behind this show besides covering the OJ story after watching the second episode. Could have been good but its whack as hell. Just stroking eogs. hes dead and her stepdad has a brand new vagina. Whatever, life continues. Ill just want for season two to come out , in hopes that it covers another story. A great example would be Fargo. Make it entertaining and stop stroking egos. We don't give a flying fudge about the kar whateverians. Maybe it's because I had really high hopes for this show but I really don't like it at all.<br/><br/>It's poorly written, poorly directed, doesn't draw you in visually, maybe in the first episode at the bloody parts but blood always captivates attention you don't have to specially work to make it stand out in one way or another. The story is amazing, very interesting, very shocking but it seems to me as though they are trying to sell it of off the story which is a shame and a waste. <br/><br/>Also Sarah Paulson is an extremely talented actress she has given plenty of amazing performances through out American Horror Story but for around this time I find her performances a bit exaggerated and at times even insincere. Watched episode 1 last night. The worst acting, and writing I have seen for a long time. This is B grade schlock. It plays out like a poorly produced 'recreation' that might be used in a documentary. I kept waiting for it to shift to a 'How to Make a Murderer' type perspective. I could not believe that the 'dramatisation' was really the show itself.<br/><br/>And this is up for awards, and has an 8.6 rating on this website? It's like some kind of bad joke. The guy from Friends and Travolta look like they are having a contest to see who 'act' the most wooden. Travolta wins this contest but had a head start due to his plastic surgery.<br/><br/>This show is for watchers of daytime soaps only. The police and the court procedural aspects are simplifications. The directing is formulaic. In one scene the prosecutors are trying to look professional despite the infantile script. How to do this? Have them walk briskly down a hall while talking! The worst television series I have seen all year. I will not be continuing on to the second episode. My partner was literally laughing out loud about how awful this production is. Most non-Americans will probably know O.J. Simpsons from this exact infamous case or simply as that silly guy from Naked Gun comedy series. It's serendipitously better if it's seen without deep knowledge of the case or as time would have it, not having much recollection of it. This is a chronicle the case with adequate dramatic proportion and prejudice undertone in surprisingly deeper look without going overboard.<br/><br/>Cuba Gooding Jr. as the alleged suspect is funnily fitting, not in his usual comical way, but as a weary hectic man. He shows the symptoms of celebrity in influence of crime. Make no mistake, this is a heinous act and the series does not shy away from the realization, yet Cuba Gooding Jr. creates a certain scandalous and distracting ambiance about the character.<br/><br/>John Travolta and David Schwimmer are admittedly not the usual cast for defense attorneys. They seem very outlandish, although the picks might just work in this case. On the other end of the spectrum are the racial prejudice and the actual footwork of the case. They do give the social undertone of the decade a portion of the limelight, still it doesn't hinder any progress and done with caution.<br/><br/>A few nice rich details about the case are also shown, both from the prosecution as well as the defense's point of views. There's quite a bit of CSI work involved, these are maintained by approachable showcasing as not to overwhelm or bore audience with police or scientific jargon. It is also nice to see the scheming antics the lawyers pull to stall or gain any advantage. Some parts of these might just be weird enough to be true.<br/><br/>The name of the case might paint a sinister portrait, but it's actually displayed with light ironical accessible approach and still a balanced enough investigation aspect to not demean the gravity of the event. Oh man... So sad it's over! Why so short??! 
Murphy, you are an artist god. I very much loved the second season than the first one. I mean, the OJ's was very good, but not so much has the Versace's. Maybe it's because i'm European, or maybe it's because im used to all the crimes in USA, that we watch in films and on the news, so the OJ's case i always saw it like another "normal" (not normal at all!) us boring thing. Did he did it or Not? And on Versace's case it was always the "why".. which was also the typical young traumatized child, who wasnt loved by one or both is parents/family, who was thought to be a fight dog and who would eventually bite. The psychological level on this season was more intriguing and exciting. Everyone on this season has done an incredible job, and the actors are amazing. Your Cunanan, is impossible to hate... even 'tho we all know what he did..! Versace is a total look-alike. Congrats also to Penelope, she has portrayed a lovely Donnatella. Anything from Toobin contains a lot of false, exaggerated drama and this show is far from different, sure he was in O.J in America and good at making up rules for how long a jury should be sequestered when he's not the one away from his family.<br/><br/>To say nothing of his own hypocrisy and personal issues over the years in the media.<br/><br/>Most of the people involved are quick to point out the things flat out wrong with this series.<br/><br/>Bill Hodgman did not have a full blown collapse in any courtroom, he had some chest pains, went to hospital, and that was it, he was in court and fine through trial.<br/><br/>If Fuhrman was worshiping Nazi paraphernalia, no one would know that, same with Clark and Dardin romance. <br/><br/>They really needed to produce actors to play the Goldman's and the Browns. <br/><br/>Could they make (where's the bag Kardashian) out to be a bigger hero while ignoring that part of it? <br/><br/>Just seemed like many of the scenes were made up or oversold for dramatics so it would run ten weeks, they got a memorable cast and frankly an excellent actor but poor choice to play Simpson.<br/><br/>Be prepared to be skeptical and question what you watched. Most of the people who lived it felt it was full of lies and misconceptions. <br/><br/>But it got awards and made money. Basically, once again, the name of Versace is used to sell something else. Also, the story about the killer is boring and things seen a thousand times in other films about killers and serial killers. Nothing new! Boring and cliche. So much filler, like the story of Jeff Trail but man other scenes. Many things seem there only for shock value. Plus the storyline is weird, it goes back and forward WAY too many times and it's not clear often, I think this is done to give some sort of originality and confuse the viewer because otherwise it would be a very boring and cliche story. I thought I'd wait for the final episode but I can no longer wait. This season has much good and fascinating aspects but lacks a coherent thread to pull it together. Fundamentally this is the story of a spree killer who murders Gianni Versace. This is not a spoiler unless you think the title of the series is in itself a spoiler. I'm saddened mostly by the sympathetic portrayal of Versace, who fairs well as portrayed except that he speaks more with a spanish accent than an Italian one. Same goes for Donnatella Versace, though she has more of an edge to her. <br/><br/>The killer, Andrew Cunanon, is a serial liar and confabulator on level even worse, if possible than our Idiot President. But coming into the final episode, he's being treated as a possible victim of both his father and mother. But truthfully, there is little ties ties the victim to his killer. We're left guessing what is true and what isn't. Truth as always has to be in between. The title of the second season is incredibly misleading. It's about the killer's past and relationships, not about Versace.
The timeline is very frustating. There is no sense of progress in the story. It just keeps getting deeper and deeper into the killer's past. 
After a fantastic first season, a terrible second one. Not worth the time. I thought the entire story had been told in the first two episodes!<br/><br/>To my shock there's more. And it is repetitive and so poorly written and acted I gave up half way through the fourth episode. Because everything had been told in the first two episodes.<br/><br/>The Assassination of Gianni Versace is just a limited subject that is being stretched to the limit. The second season is the biggest let off I've seen . If your life depended on watching this show, JUST DIE , it'd be way less painful than watching this piece of garbage This is being shown here on TV in England at the moment and I was curious to see at least some of it as I remember the whole thing, and the TV footage of the trial, from when I spent a few years living in America in the 90s. Also, a colleague of mine told me she has been watching it and that she thought it was good. Up to now though I haven't seen any of the episodes but it was on tonight and when I was channel surfing I came across it and decided to take a look. <br/><br/>Oh my god . . . where to start?! Firstly, Cuba Gooding Jr as OJ? Really??? Whoever thought that was a great idea should be fired! He's a pretty good actor but physically doesn't bear any resemblance to OJ, save for the fact that both are not Caucasian! As others have pointed out, OJ was physically commanding and with chiselled good looks - Cuba Gooding Jr is much slighter and his looks are not chiselled, more furrowed and slightly mushy! Then, David Schwimmer as Kardashian - huh? Again, he's not a bad actor but seems very miscast in that role. I also don't buy John Travolta in his role. In fact, from what I saw of this particular episode pretty much all of the actors didn't come across well in their roles and the acting across the board seemed stilted and not believable.<br/><br/>I have to say, this was so bad to me that my toes were curling with cringiness and I could only bear to watch about 15 minutes of it before I had to switch to watching something better! The only positive thing about what I've seen of this show was that it made me laugh - which presumably is not the reaction the actors, producers, etc, involved in the making of it were hoping to elicit from the audience! The life of American spree killer Andrew Cunanan is explored in this series which is truly executive producer Ryan Murphy's masterpiece. Modern American themes such as the obsessive desire to be famous, a lust for wealth, societal power dynamics, and bias and discrimination against members of the LGBTQ community (including the military). Universal themes are touched on as well such as family, envy, self-destruction, guilt, ambition, creativity, and the desire for companionship and love. It's all brilliantly interwoven into the series. The direction, writing, casting, acting, and cinematography are spectacular. And as fascinating and enthralling as this 9-part series is, Darren Criss steals the show with his absolutely mesmerizing performance as Cunanan. As talented an actor as Criss is, he manages to take his acting skills to an even higher level turning in one of the most compelling dramatic performances seen on television in a long time. Criss' Cunanan is one of the most powerful portrayals of a diabolical character in the history of limited series television. Further, the structure of the series, in showing major events in Cunanan's life in reverse order, makes for a sometimes jarring and uneasy sensation which only heightens the viewing experience. If you enjoy outstanding, dramatic storytelling and top notch acting, you will greatly enjoy this series. Of note, the series features an impressive breakthrough performance by Australian actor Cody Fern who portrays Cunanan's love interest, David. I can't really tell if this is glorifying a serial killer or not. While the story is entertaining, the costumes and casting are brilliant, I wasn't a huge fan of the timeline of the episodes. When you finally get to see the plot progress, the next episodes are flashbacks that almost seem like a stalling method. One very meaningful flashback was where David Madson's character is a boy going hunting with his father for the first time. He was disturbed by the dead animal and instead of bashing him, his father understood and said it was okay to not like hunting and "enjoying a coffee with you was very fun". It was so touching because men can be so aggressive to children about "manly" activities and pressure boys, especially gays, to be something they're not. It was a nice moment to show how opposed to violence Madson was and how good his father was. I don't know how true that specific story is, but it's a very special one. Overall, this show is worth a watch! Although not every episode is as good as the first, this is, without a doubt, a quality series worth watching, Darren Criss is sensational. He was good on Glee but he shows his real talents here. The remainder of the cast is very good too, as is just about everything in this production. La serie si guarda velocissimamente perchÃ© tiene veramente incollati. I watched the actual trial from the beginning and the back stories brought out in the current series. However,after many years of seeing the real O.J. in a variety of televised venues, the portrayal wasn't even close. O.J. Simpson has a much deeper voice and I can't envision him having a high screechy,voice even when under severe stress. The actor's voice was closer to George Jefferson's. If you're looking for a story about Gianni Versace, I wouldn't recommend this show. The name trick us to watch because we think it's a Gianni Versace story, and all that we see is a story about Andrew Cunanan. There's a few parts about the Versace family after the murder but all they seemed to me that they put them there to say that it was, in fact, a Gianni Versace story, when clearly it's not.
If you have the curiosity to see how Gianni Versace was murdered, watch the first episode and that's it.
The show didn't make me feel like I needed to watch everything, it was very difficult to watch the entire season.
My 3 stars are only for the Gianni and Donatella parts. The Assassination of Gianni Versace improves upon its yet-acclaimed predecessor with a unique humanistic approach to crime retelling, supported by opulent cinematography and perfect casting. After a really good first season comes second - the ode to Versace's killer. I honestly haven't been expecting that angle of the show. Especially when it could have been told from so many point of views. It feels like the director has lost his perspective somewhere around 2nd episode and shifted more towards 'American Crime Story: Andrew Cunanan'! I really do hope that he finds his compass toward the end of the season 'cause this has become awfully tiresome. BTW, this kind of focus in American cinematography and TV shows makes me realize why there is so many serial killers and mass murderers in America - it's been popularised.. so I guess every psycho wants his five minutes of Glory. I discovered at the end credits of the 10th episode that this a true story, that the character portrayed have been real. I had no knowledge of that court case, living and growing abroad. It was a very surprising and fascinating discovery.<br/><br/>In call cases, this series is absolutely tremendous. The acting, the storytelling, the writing, editing is of the highest calibre. I wish that judge Lance Ito's character would have been developed a bit further. That the story would show more of him and his life outside the courtroom, like for other important characters, as it's very interesting character as well. It's possible the production tried some episodes doing that and may have realized it works better by keeping the judge Ito more mysterious by showing less of his personal life.<br/><br/>Finally, the cinematography is technically excellent but I think it could have gone a bit "further" and more "creative" in some scenes as there is potential to play with in the courtroom especially. But of course, usually, on these series, there is so much pages of script to get in one day that it just reduces opportunities to play with the image and lighting... which is often what makes the difference with feature films.<br/><br/>Regardless, this series is absolutely great work. When I first saw ads for this miniseries, my curiosity was piqued because it boasted what can only be described as a star-studded cast. Almost every major role is played by a well-known face, if not name. What especially caught my attention, and elicited initial skepticism, was the fact that John Travolta had been cast as Robert Shapiro, and by the looks of him (all done up in bushy, dark eyebrows and chestnut wig) I believed the show would be way too campy for my liking; and in all honesty, his portrayal is the weakest link here and could very well be described as just that, campy. <br/><br/>However, much to my pleasant surprise, I was thrilled with how masterfully executed American Crime Story is!<br/><br/>The series opens with the discovery of the murder of Nicole Brown and Ron Goldman at Bundy Drive and progresses quickly to Simpson's home on Rockingham. It's not long before O.J. is the prime suspect, based not just on the premise that the spouse is always the number one suspect in a murder until disqualified, but on the overwhelming amount of physical evidence. The prosecution believed (and rightfully so) that they had a slam-dunk case and, as we all know, 22 years later, they couldn't have been more wrong.<br/><br/>Over the course of 10 expertly-crafted episodes, the series follows the now-famous members of the prosecution, the defense team, and the defendant as they struggle to control the narrative of the trial. Was O.J. Simpson, the heroic, revered football player and African American icon a cold-blooded killer as the evidence devastatingly proved? Or was he just another black man being framed by the L.A.P.D., which was struggling with numerous charges of racism and brutality in the wake of the Rodney King beating?<br/><br/>Peripheral characters like Kato Kaelin and Faye Resnick make sporadic and brief appearances as a small reminder of the immense scope of the trial and the various conspiracy theories that were floated, but this show belongs wholly to the legal teams and Simpson.<br/><br/>I remember watching the investigation and subsequent trial coverage faithfully as it aired on every major network for weeks on end back in 1994 and 1995, and every facet of the story covered here was familiar to me, but I still appreciated the breathtaking expertise in putting together a well-written, skillfully-edited, and astonishingly well-cast show. At times, I was convinced I was watching actual trial footage. Sarah Paulson as Marcia Clark and Sterling K. Brown as Christopher Darden are eerily (almost unbelievably) authentic!<br/><br/>I highly recommend this series. If you think it's just another retread of an old and hackneyed story, think again. You're in for a real treat. I had been looking forward to seeing this for some time now, and finally got FX NOW back up & running, and watched the first couples eps last night. If you recall (how could you not??) that whole ordeal played out in the media twenty years ago involving sports legend OJ, the investigation, the glove, Kato!, etc... this series recreates all that from an inside perspective. I found this completely compelling, and comparable production-wise to any mainstream theatrical feature. In fact, I see that it's produced by the same writer/producer team that made "The People Vs. Larry Flynt", "Man on the Moon", "Auto Focus", and other biopics of media celebrities..?? Cuba Gooding has a good presence to represent the Juice well enough. David Schwimmer is perfect as Kardashian (and look for the whole "Keeping Up With The Kardashian" clan- who were kids back then!), and I know someone mentioned that John Travolta's acting was a bit off as Robert Shapiro, and I can see that at first. I think part of the problem was the make-up job sorta made him look like he had a face-lift, and that was a bit distracting, but I think as time goes on, you start to go with it-?? Courtney B. Vance is also perfect as Johnny Cochran. And was that... Malcolm-Jamal Warner as AC Cowlings- who of course drove the Bronco in the infamous chase-?? And look for a whole slew of other stars- I don't even know where to begin. I am LOVIN this so far!............. Thumbs WAY up!! The first season deserves all that good credit its been given. Brilliant actors and for me who wasn't old enough to have any interest in following the trial when it happened - but as everyone else has heard so much about it - it was really interesting to follow the twists and turns of it. Really enjoyed the first season, which is best described as a really good, interesting trial show, and based on a true story.<br/><br/>So here comes season two - another famous murder in american (modern) history. And about there all similarities to season one ends. It's a murder, heavily covered in the press, that took time not to long ago in the US. 
Everything else of the story-line is completely different. We dont get a trial. We dont get twists. Instead its a whole other show, which for me was so disappointing. If this much "creativity" is allowed from one season to the next, I guess season three or four may very well take off in "Jane the virgin" (that show also takes place in the US, with famous people, and has some cops and murders in it) ((If you dont know what show "Jane the virgin" is, its a classic telenovela drama/comedy/romance)). <br/><br/>So my only advise is, if you didn't like season one - have a try at season two! For me, I gave up after a few episodes of the second season, because that surely wasn't my cup of tea at all. Can strongly recommend season one though. Great cast like season 1 ! Could be even better only 4 episodes in and already thinking it could be. The people vs. O.J. Simpson is an enthralling, dramatic look at the trial of the century. The cast in particular is dead perfect. Gooding Jr. in particular brings drama and heart wrenching emotion to the image of O.J himself. And "Friends" star David Schwimmer plays a prefect Rob Kardashian, bringing a devastating look at the downfall of his best friend. This show is nothing short of amazing. As a person who did not personally live through the trial, this is a greatly informative show. Every minute in the show feels planned and while that kind of structure can be strict and stringent in many shows/movies, this feels like the stricture only adds to the drama. The show is extremely well written, and a perfect look at the end of the football hero. I absolutely enjoyed the first season,,,, even though the OJ simpson case has been played out to death, the writers found a way to keep it fresh, and Sarah paulson absolutely deserved all the awards... But versace is just not as engaging- the acting is exceptional but the story is told in achronoglical order and it's a little confusing to follow at first- the first episode and last episode were good, but everything in between was meh I just finished the first three episodes and I do not really know where to start... <br/><br/>I guess these episodes were made to put the viewer into context, introduce the characters and their roles in the case and trial. So it's important... But I wouldn't have spent as much time on it as they have. I mean in 1994, I was five years old and watching this TV show I already know the context. I remember watching the news with my parents, seeing that white bronco going up and down the freeway, I remember my parents following the trial and my father repeating incessantly: "I don't think he did it, but he had something to do with it". So, on a personal note I have found these first three episodes pretty long. <br/><br/>The main characters: <br/><br/>John Travolta as Shapiro... To be honest, he might be doing a good job, but his rigid face and lack of emotion distracts me.<br/><br/>Cuba Gooding Jr as OJ: On paper this seemed great, but in execution I fear that he is trying too hard to make up in acting what he lacks physically. Now, appearance isn't everything, this I know. But OJ is an imposing guy, watching videos and interviews, looking at photos, you notice he is a charming guy despite his large physique that could be a bit scary and behind all of that there is something unsettling about him... Something Cuba Gooding Jr isn't doing a very good job portraying, no matter how much respect I have for him and his work. <br/><br/>David Schwimmer as Rob Kardashian: Now for those who dare say Schwimmer is not a "drama" actor, I tell you, go take a look at the HBO mini series "Band of Brothers", his role is a small one, but the dignity and life he gave that character gave me chills. That being said, I don't think he is doing a great job here so far. I feel like he and almost everyone on this show are trying too hard and it is just being portrayed as over acting. <br/><br/>Sara Paulson as Marcia Clark: I am sorry, but I am not seeing it. And I really can't put my finger on it, I don't know if it's the script or the acting itself, but every time she is on screen I find myself rolling my eyes and waiting for it to get interesting. <br/><br/>Now, to end all of this... The portrayal of the Karfashian kids and Kris Jemner which to me is easy and cheap. <br/><br/>We see other characters families and children but none go into the same "detail" as the Kardashian family. And I truly believe if they weren't as famous as they are today they would not have so much screen time... It's a cheap shot, trying to get people who don't really know who OJ is or what the story is about interested. Enticing them with the hope that they will get an other inside look to the Kardashian family circus. <br/><br/>I think the story, the media frenzy it became and the facts speak for themselves. I will go to the end of this show because I find it super interesting to get an understanding of how the trial went down and how OJ got acquitted... Seeing as I was so young, I remember the story but the social context was always harder to grasp.<br/><br/>It's not bad, but I am hoping it will get better. This is so excellently put together in every respect, and it brought back so many memories of when the entire country was gripped by this trial. But there is one major problem. Those of us who watched the trail from gavel to gavel, as well as the endless news commentary, were certain beyond any doubt that OJ was guilty. But this series, in what is possibly an attempt at pandering to prejudices, suggests that false evidence may have p;anted, and subtly infers OJ''s possible innocence. This is just wrong. And sad. The reason I love Cuba Gooding is because he's so good at portraying conflicted characters who have a lot of heart but get into messes. He did that here too, but from what I hear, that is not who O.J. is.
My understanding is that he was an arrogant, horny, self-absorbed hedonist. Gooding's portrayal is much more sympathetic. As for physical size, it is important, because the real O.J.' s size was related to his cocky charisma. People admire a big athletic guy. The Rock has that, but he's too big.
Everyone here is complaining about Schwimmer here, but I thought he was good. Granted he had been a decadent party animal with O.J., and what kind of person has O.J. as their best friend anyway, or produces daughters like the ones he did? But I suppose his religious side did play a role in real life. After all, he had left both his wife and the lawyer world.<br/><br/>The Garcetti character was stilted. I know that Davison guy is a decent actor, but I felt like he was serving almost as a narrator filling in the blanks. Of course the best parts are the two defense lawyers and Cochran. They all seem natural. The portrayal of two working-class public lawyers versus a "Dream Team" is done well, via scenes at all of their homes with their families.<br/><br/>Not that it matters, but Nicole probably was part of a rather shallow and decadent lifestyle. Who else would marry a guy like O.J? A lot of girls are drawn to cocky jocks and must pay the price in terms of their infidelity and abuse. Obviously in this case it went way too far.<br/><br/>I believe Mr. Goldman that his son had a good heart, but he was also drawn to that West L.A. scene of restaurants and materialism I'm guessing. That world can lead to bad liaisons.
My motto is: stay away from heathens. Season 2 of ACS was a mess the main cause of that is the time lapse of the series, they were moments i couldn't follow the events because of the non stop back and forward. Second problem is the backstories of the victims of Cunanans, we get an episode of Jeff Trail in army , memories of the childhood of Davide, backstory of Cunanans father backstory of almost everyone . that was tottaly boring, i would prefer more time about GV backstory rather than all the others. Finally for me the biggest problem is that the season leaves you with many questions...Does Andrew Cunanan have Aids (as implied in episode one,the scene with the scars in the beach), did GV and Andrew have talk once only? Did they have a relationship? Did GV infect Andrew? Was Versace suffer from ear cancer or Aids? who was the girl with the blue dress passing in front of camera in the tv news ? When and why Andrew live with Elizabeth ?
Except all that the casting was excellent.
4/10 The original events virtually hijacked a year out of my life, as I was certain of O.J. Simpson's guilt the first time he gave a press conference after her death, with the typical abuser's tripe about how Nicole hit him too. I was skeptical about this series at first, because I thought that out of fear of offending those who cling stubbornly to the idea that he was actually not guilty, they were going to try to straddle the fence, leaving the viewer to ponder what actually occurred on the night of the murder. But I was thrilled to see that this movie is showing events as they truly happened, not as his defense team tried to muddle up by casting law enforcement officers as the villains, instead of the man who carried his domestic abuse to the ultimate finale, by butchering his ex-wife, as well as a completely innocent bystander. Bravo. The only disappointment for me was the casting of Cuba Gooding Jr as O.J., David Schwimmer as Robert Kardashian, and John Travolta as Robert Shapiro. It seemed that since the producers went to such lengths to make the rest of the cast look almost identical to the real characters, they wouldn't have settled on these actors. I love them all as actors, but they are just not physically appropriate, and I find it a bit distracting. Maybe as the season progresses, my eyes will eventually accept them as who they are meant to portray. I just want to say this mini-series has been excellent. I remember back in the day where I was when the Bronco Chase Began. I was watching T.V. I think it was The X-Files, when the news broke. I was shocked, and like most tried to follow it as best as I could. I was working when The verdict came back, and my jaw dropped. I couldn't believe it, I thought sure it was going to be a guilty verdict. As one who worked in the Criminal Justice system, our justice system is flawed when it comes to those with power.<br/><br/>As for this show, it is outstanding. The actors involved look so much like the real McCoy's, WOW. When I watched the premiere I was hooked. The show takes you back to the night it happened. The Bronco chase, The creation of the Dream Team, and currently we are at the trial. Here's something I didn't know. I wondered how the Kardashian's became a big name. The father was part of the dream team, and they were very close to the Simpsons. A great mini-series I highly recommend. Excellent acting by all and wonderful production but the broken narrative story telling and flash backs cant hide the fact that none of the characters are likeable nor packs the story any punch. It's basically a psychopath killing people. What a disappointment after the brilliant first season. The first season featuring OJ was very well written and intriguing. Each character was well defined and well written which encouraged the viewers to get engrossed in thier lives. I finished the first season in 2 days during a weekend.<br/><br/>The second season was just too boring and lengthy with unnecessary spotlight given only to Cunnanans character and little was shown about Gianni and Donatella Versace (the other characters were too forgetful as the writers didn't worked on them). Cunnanans troubled past and motives were stretched to the point of boredom and it would had saved me a lot of time if I would've just skipped from 1st to the 9th episode. The acting from all the actors were very good but the story telling was lackluster and uninteresting. For anyone older than a millennial, they probably remember the endless courtroom TV we were subjected to for months on end. I recall what felt like weeks of the same DNA analyst answering questions, Marcia Clark's face became a fixture, and I remember Mark Fuhrman's monotone delivery; unemotional.<br/><br/>It wasn't until after I had watched this show--and learned things I didn't know about the trial and its players--that I sought out a description of the crime itself, to put all the hype and hysteria of the trial in context of the act of murder itself. I came across a video reenactment on YouTube that was sobering, angering and startling in its detail: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqpvNQZxCtg ("OJ Murders Nicole and Ron")<br/><br/>There is no question that Simpson murdered these two people, regardless of racist cops; but what was lost in the trial was the sheer barbarism of the act. One is left wondering whether Simpson's brain is affected by CTE symptoms, now seen in so many other NFL players. It would explain his temper and his capacity for committing such a heinous act of violence with no remorse. Monstrous inhumanity. Addicting. Just really well done. Kept me completely engaged. Cuba Gooding? OJ Simpson? Why is this story being hyped yet once again? What exactly is wrong with the American viewer? Are you kidding me? These searing questions will not be answered by this film, only by your own inner voice. I feel that the Khardasians must be the active force behind this film, as the plague of their presence on the world begins with this case. Not much chance of a spoiler here, as everyone knows how this story turned out. Personally, ANY film that has in it Cuba Gooding is a film I avoid seeing. In this film he is not believable for a second. That this tawdry production is receiving a high rating at this esteemed site is depressing. I don't understand it. If you decide to go against the wave and refuse to watch this contrived production, you will feel better for it. Why does Donatella Versace have a Spanish accent? Rhetorical. Poor casting. Basically you can watch solely episode 1 and 9, the rest is a never ending buffer. Granted, we're only 3 episodes in, but I feel the need to write a review on how I feel about the show, rather than wait until the end of the season's run.<br/><br/>"The People vs. O.J. Simpson" is the FX drama that dramatizes the aftermath of Nicole Brown Simpson's and Ron Goldman's murder(s), the trial, and the eventual verdict of O.J. Simpson in 1994. A media frenzy that sent everyone to their televisions at every given moment for an entire year, wondering how a beloved football star and actor could be turned into a criminal. It's as neurotic as it is interesting, and the show is able to capture every ounce of the story's nuance.<br/><br/>People are pretty divided on the case: is O.J. the killer or not? The series is able to take you in - every single episode - thinking you know how you feel about the case, then making you think a different way. With its sleek camera movement, larger than life sets, and an all-star cast, "The People vs. O.J. Simpson" makes you feel as though you are (re)living the nostalgia of the "trial of the century". I can't tell you how much I enjoy getting an inside on what went on behind the cameras, and how each legal team came to their conclusions and trumped each other. It's very intricate and the show handles everyone's jarring emotions with care.<br/><br/>All-star casting keeps this show addictive. David Schwimmer as Robert Kardashian and Sarah Paulson as Marcia Clark capture audience attention with vastly different personalities. Both want to win, and you can't help but root for them, even though they're on opposing sides. Rob just wants to be reassured that his friend is innocent, and Marcia wants to bring justice to a woman that has no voice to speak with, anymore. They paint the pictures of how the audiences in real life felt back when the case was happening. (And it's funny and ironic to point out that the Kardashian family appear together in a restaurant (in episode 3), and they are just starting to have their names realized.) <br/><br/>To think John Travolta was last seen on primetime as '70s hunk, Vinnie Barbarino, is scary to think about, especially since his portrayal of Robert Shapiro is one that haunts you because of his stagnant emotions and plastic face. But he plays a man ready to win, and that's exactly what Travolta is doing with the audience. Courtney B. Vance is another whose performance for winning truly wins and commands attention every time he is on screen. You want to listen to these men.<br/><br/>And then there's Cuba Gooding Jr. as O.J. Simpson. Is he Simpson? No. Is he trying to be Simpson? Yes. Is he pulling it off? Sure. The problem that I do have (and that a lot have), is not his height, but his charm. Not to think Gooding doesn't have charm, but he doesn't have the charisma that helped Simpson eventually win over (half) the public and win his case. Gooding is doing a phenomenal job with his acting and easily scraping past legal questions with real emotions. It's a good performance, but it isn't what I was hoping out of O.J. Simpson.<br/><br/>All-in-all, so far, it's a great show. Even though we all know the outcome, the show does a great job revealing one thing after another and telling a story that everyone loves to hear. I'm continuing my journey with the series, and I'm excited to see what lies ahead! For season 1 alone I would give score 9 or maybe even 10 - the details and precision of bringing back OJ Simpson case in a TV show will blow your mind. After each episode of season 1, I spent time digging up the real facts and stories of that case and comparing them with that show. Sarah Paulson acting is pricless. The OJ Simpson's "Dream team" portrayed by Nathan Lane, David Schwimmer, John Travolta and Courtney B. Vance will blow you right into face. And season 1 is not only about OJ trial - it's about racism struggle across US in the 1990s.<br/><br/>Unfortunatelly the exelent performance of season 1 was lost in season 2 - yes, there are also great acting performed by Edgar Ramirez as Gianni Versace and Penelope Cruz as Donatella Versace - but two great acting performance won't help 2nd season - it's simply boring and has very little to keep audience before silver screen. Amazing show.
I honestly questioned the guilt of OJ by the end. 
If he had of kept quiet perhaps I would still feel the same. 
Anyway, well worth watching. I have read a lot of negative reviews that says that the series doesn't add anything to what they already know from the news, but for a person like me who is not American and was born in 1994, it is really good. I actually have never heard of O.J before this series. The show is a very good documentary for a historical event. I loved every minute of this series. I remember coming home watching the slow speed Bronco chase to watching the verdict being read on TV at work. The producers Hollywooded it up, but did give an excellent perspective of what was going on at the time, so soon after the Rodney King verdict. Had this crime happened 10 years later, OJ probably would have been convicted. I appreciate what this series did to show the lives of everyone involved and humanizing them. The actors resemblance of the original characters were uncanny, especially Marcia Clark. My own two cents is this trial should have never been televised, it turned it into a circus. This one is worth watching, I think I was more nervous watching the verdict on this show than the original verdict! Bravo, I'll be watching this again! It deserves some serious awards! I was a little girl when the real trial of OJ Simpson for the murders of his wife Nicole and Ron Goldman took place. I don't have much memories of it but I know how it kept the country and the world completely addicted for most a year.<br/><br/>I've watched a lot of footage about that case including the great ESPN documentary 'OJ: Made in America' so don't mind me if I compare the two as they were released within months of each other. <br/><br/>Let's begin with the good points first. The overall performance of the cast is spot on. They added some drama in their play to make it more excited but it was pretty accurate in general. I was particularly amazed by Sarah Paulson, Courtney B.Vance and Sterling K.Brown. Those 3 really nailed it. They brought a touch of empathy to the real people they are impersonate in the show as we follow them behind the scenes and discover a new side of them. Sarah deserved her Emmy for her performance as Marcia Clark. I remember how Marcia looked like an Iron lady when she took the stand but Sarah made her more vulnerable than she looked and I take this as a big plus. When I see the real Marcia getting interviewed, I feel this side of her and it's good to see.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is not bad either except for Cuba Gooding Jr and John Travolta who I truly think were far from being the best choice to play the part of OJ and Shapiro but I will talk about this later on alongside another issue.<br/><br/>I also liked how the trial itself was accurately presented. You can feel a lot of research has been done to make it look like as real as possible. Of course you can't expect any suspense in that show as we all know how it turned out. I wish we could have seen the Goldmans more often especially how they are coping with the death of their beloved son instead of Rob Kardashian and his family who is appearing way too often without bringing anything. The Goldman and Browns would have however more than you can imagine.<br/><br/>Which brings me to my main issue about this show: Where is Ron Shipp?? For the people who are not very familiar with him, Ron was one of the best friends of OJ and Nicole. He was a member of the LAPD and a close witness of what was happening in their marriage especially the domestic abuse. He's also the one whom Simpson confessed having dreams of killing Nicole. But here in that show, he doesn't appear at all! He's not even mentioned once in the 10 episodes. Not once while he's definitely a center piece of the case. That's something OJ made in America didn't miss as Ron was one of the main part of the cast as he shone the light about what was going on in the Simpson Marriage. They should have made him part of the story as he would have brought so much. Having him completely removed is gross negligence at least for me.<br/><br/>Now about Cuba Gooding Jr. He should not have been the one casted for the role of OJ. OJ was charismatic and impressive. He made the show before the camera and he still does today. Cuba is a great actor but he just doesn't have that presence. To be honest he's looking like a pawn in that show. He's also way too small and not as athletic as the real OJ was. If there is one actor who would have been better, it should have been Denzel Washington. He has the charisma and the body. It should have been him.<br/><br/>And John Travolta as Robert Shapiro is a complete joke. I truly don't know why they chose such a bad actor to undertake the part of that colorful lawyer. I watched a lot of footage of Shapiro and he never gesticulated in the manner Travolta did, ever. Instead he was someone much restrained in front of the camera, he sure wanted the attention but Travolta, with his grand gesture frenzy makes him look like a clown. To be honest I never had a high opinion of John Travolta and he surely not redeemed himself with that performance. I'd rather say he buried himself a few feet more.<br/><br/>But besides that, I would give the show a high mark as it deserves it. It's not perfect but it surely does the job. If you take the first season of American Crime Story as its own, standalone miniseries, what you have is a thrilling account of an infamous yet crucial event in American history. Whether you are familiar with these events or not, I would wager the series remains interesting no matter what. The performances are exemplary (some, like Travolta's or Cuba's, are controversial), and everything from cinematography to pacing to dialogue is stellar. Informative and wildly entertaining. I hope Season 2 is as good. Okay, I'm sure my review will be the least helpful review to the early 20 somethings and below, but to the rest of you? Well, come on. First off OJ is still alive, so it is so very tasteful for you to reenact the trial that acquitted him, but not really. The public has been hating The Juice since the day he took the stand...strike that, the day they saw him in cuffs in his backyard for a minute before the cops realized they had no probable cause to cuff him just yet, but that's what they do to all black men in Los Angeles county in the 80's and 90's that I personally know of. <br/><br/>I lived in Los Angeles during this volatile period in history and got a front row seat at the Donut shop I worked at, as the only graveyard shift front counter help. Cops would visit the shop, which was the first of two shops* owned by an ex-cop ( who incidentally quit the force, in part, because of how it was ran. He was an awesome guy!).<br/><br/>Now what I am about to say is going out to the world, but I assure you nobody at this shop or it's second location is responsible for it, just the two cops I heard on several occasions talk about beating up black guys and my ears that overheard it being spoken to the donut maker, who was an old guy in the 80's so is probably dead by now. One story I recall was that they made sure the 'N'word was down below the counter out of view of the camera before they beat the crap out of him. No lie, it's what I heard with my own ears. I knew it was no surprise that the riots would happen a few years later. I heard other stories first hand, but honestly that was enough to remember! The rest of the stories registered emotionally, but personally I don't like the weight of hate so the stories disappeared as I heard them, I just remember the cruel laughter and the emotion of the words coming from these officers of the law.<br/><br/>Okay, so is this a review of the series? Maybe. We still have a long way to go in changing our society for the better so long as we watch ANYTHING that portrays people in biased ways from the reality. This series is doing just that IMO.<br/><br/>By the way, the donut shop you see in the film TANGERINE is the 2nd shop my boss opened, it was the first business in that building and I was the first graveyard counter person. Ah' the memories of busting up tricks and fending off unwanted flirtation. These days I'd settle for any. lol I wanted to enjoy this series to relive/learn about this huge event of the 90's, but David Scwimmer and Cuba Gooding? OJ was/is a confident guy, and all I can now hear in the back of my head is Cuba Gooding constantly crying for "mamma" and a glass of orange juice. And is David Schwimmer supposed to be Robert Kardashian or is he still Ross? Every scene he is in he looks like he is about to burst out in tears. They do a good job of recreating the events, but the acting was unbearable. I felt like this was some weird montage of Theo Huxtable, Ross Geller, Radio, and "the now much older" Vinnie Barbarino. I went into this series without many expectations; I had heard it was well done, but I was not prepared for the tour de force I saw. <br/><br/>What could have been trashy cable schlock turned out to be not only a cultural artifact, but a work of art in and of itself. <br/><br/>I was in college when the OJ trial happened, and while I was never obsessed with it (as many were), it was nonetheless inescapable. I even had a sociology professor who made us watch highlights in class every day. Everyone was talking about it. It was a defining moment of our generation. <br/><br/>This series captured SO MUCH of the feeling that surrounded the trial; the chaos, the morbid fascination, the passion, the dread. It was all laid bare on the screen and masterfully presented with an insight and sensitivity that frankly shocked me. The writers and director somehow managed to sustain incredible dramatic tension throughout the series despite the fact we already knew how the story ends -- in fact, I'd even say that the tension was actually heightened for that very reason.<br/><br/>The casting and acting was likewise perfect across the board. I've read a few complaints about Cuba Gooding Jr. not being the best choice for OJ, but I strongly disagree. While he's not exactly a dead-ringer, he embodies the character so completely and does such a good job with the role that after the first episode you stop being bothered by his lack of physical resemblance. <br/><br/>It's rare that I'm so pleasantly surprised by a production, but this was a standout. Bravo to all involved. I unexpectedly loved this series. If you would have asked me about a mini-series about the OJ trial I wouldn't have thought much of it. But once I saw the first episode I was hooked.<br/><br/>Keep in mind I was around at the time of the trial and watched parts of it on TV. In particular will never forget the final day when the verdict came out. <br/><br/>This series was both very entertaining and educational. And even my wife who was not old enough to see the original trial was fascinated with the show as well.<br/><br/>For the most part the show was done very well. High production values, the actors did a great job, etc. The only one I thought was a little off was Cuba Gooding Jr. Nothing wrong with his acting mind you, he actually did a bang-up job of it! But while most the actors looked really close to their real life counterparts, Cuba is probably just a little too small and didn't look athletic enough like OJ is/was. They could have done the usual thing (like they do with Tom Cruise, in Lord of Rings, etc.) and filmed him from a lower point, propped him up, etc. And he could have worked out to loose some body fat, etc.<br/><br/>A good thing about a show like this (although obviously dramatized and who knows how much untruths the filled in the blanks with) it gets you to think and reflect.<br/><br/>As I watched this, there is still something eating me that I observed from the original trial. Why did Judge Lance Ito let the prosecution walk all over court? He literally let them get away with murder (pun intended). He seem/ed to have little backbone at all. Now I'm sure he is supposed to be neutral in frame of mind, but he ignored the fact the prosecution was deliberately trying to drag everything out. And they abused the court time and time again. He totally lost control over the court. Plus he let political things going on outside the case effect his judgement, etc. It's as if he just wanted to bask in all the attention and media frenzy. I can only wonder would have happened if there was a better stronger judge instead.. This is without question the greatest television show I have ever seen. Here is why:<br/><br/>1. The acting: This show has better than movie performances by Cuba and Travolta, along with the rest of the cast. I could literally feel OJ's pain when I saw Cuba portraying him in the back of the bronco with the gun to his head. I really cannot remember being so moved by a performance from TV or even a movie. And in my opinion this is Travolta's best performance I've seen yet. <br/><br/>2. The script: It is very well written and in such a way as to feel like it was an actual portrayal of how it all went down. To me this is one of the most important things in documentary dramas and this show nails it.<br/><br/>3. The pace: The pacing is just perfect in this show. Its obvious to anyone that watches.<br/><br/>There is more I could write about, but basically if you haven't seen this and you like these genre you will love this show. Season 1 was edge-of-the-seat gripping and extremely interesting, despite almost everyone watching knowing the final verdict.<br/><br/>Season 2 on the other hand is messy, weird, boring, and confusing. I'm two episodes in and have no more motivation to watch. Unlike season 1, season 2 offers no more detail about the assignation and personal lives than what you can find in a few clicks on google. The rest of the show just appears to be speculation. Finally, the acting isn't as great as in the first season. Everyone has or should have some cursory knowledge of the OJ Simpson trial. It was a cultural phenomenon that significantly altered the status quo of how the media operates and how people regarded race relations and the police force. It's been covered to death and lots of people probably have 0 interest in hearing or watching any more about it. However, if anyone thinks they can skip this season of American Crime Story because they already know what happens, they are mistaken. American Crime Story delivers a thrilling batch of 10 episodes revolving around the lives of the people at the forefront of this trial. This drama shows us the trial through a lens that we have never had access to before. Sure, it's only "based on true events" and is not a documentary but this dramatization of the events surrounding this trial is gripping and very accurately portrayed.<br/><br/>The casting for this season was very good and the actors delivered with very compelling performances. I cannot say enough about Courtney B. Vance's portrayal of Johnnie Cochran. He steals the show every time he's in a scene. Without a doubt, he deserved the Emmy he won for this performance. I won't go into details but the cast of this did a wonderful job. Even Travolta, who no longer puts down great performances like he used to, does an admirable job. I suppose my one complaint is Cuba Gooding Jr. I don't dislike Gooding Jr., I'm just not sure he was right for this role. OJ was a large hulking man with a deep, baritone voice. It's just not possible for Cuba to pull that off. When I see him pretending to be a football player, I start thinking about Jerry Maguire.<br/><br/>What I enjoyed about this take on the trial is its focus on personal relationships between characters and behind the scenes interactions. The trial and evidence have been played to death and a show revolving around that would have been unnecessary. Seeing scenes such as Marcia Clark's personal struggles with sexism, divorce, custody battles, etc. gave the show a dimension missing from many of the OJ focused movies and shows out there.<br/><br/>I would call the dramatization of of the OJ trial a success and am excited to see what this series has to offer in Season 2. First off, I'm going to say that I haven't enjoyed a show as much as I did with American Crime Story in a long time due to the overwhelming number of trashy shows produced recently. I didn't expect to find this spin of the Trial of the Century so interesting when considering that I already had a lot of knowledge on the topic, however the show- writers managed to include a lot of details about the case in the show that changed my perspective of it entirely. For example, I personally did not realise the sexism that Marica Clark faced from Lance Ito and the press, nor the nature of the relationship between the two prosecutors: Chris Darden and Marcia Clark. <br/><br/>I was particularly impressed with the casting in American Crime Story as the physical resemblance of the actors to their real life counterparts was at times uncanny, and with the exception of John Travolta who plays attorney Bob Shapiro, I found that their portrayals of the characters were brilliant. I think a special mention should go out to Courtney B. Vance's for his performance as Johnny Cochran. <br/><br/>My final comment is that the show also had a really good balance between background drama and the events occurring in the courtroom. I find that many shows often make the mistake of focusing on the drama at the expense of the main story-line, but this was not the case here. I was so excited and enjoyed the series until the ending because of the made up suicide of Versace's partner. Made me question the whole story. So, every gay person in the film was murdered or killed themseleves. All the gay guys are self-loathing or weaklings or murderers. Why? And this from an out gay producer? There were definitely amazing moments and Emmy deserving acting (Darren Criss, Judith Light, Max Greenfield and Edgar Rameriz) but the final message was so wrong and not truthful. Kind of left me feeling a bit dissed. Worth the journey but not the destination. The People vs. O.J. Simpson is a television series that is based on real life events. In 1994, Nicole Brown Simpson, the ex wife of O.J. Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman were murdered. O.J. Simpson was the prime suspect of the crimes, and after his trial, he was found not guilty of both of the murders. In the series, the storyline follows both O.J. and his team of lawyers and the prosecution as well. So far this season, the crime itself was investigated, O.J. was chased on the highway in his teammate's white Bronco, and the trial has begun. A lot happens in these episodes and it is hard to look away when it gets really engaging. At this point in time, what I have seen from the television show has been not the least bit disappointing. First of all, the show is full of many great actors and actresses. They play the roles so well that I will occasionally think Cuba Gooding Jr. really went through this process. The show exemplifies many different perspectives throughout each episode. The story follows both the prosecution and the defendant.<br/><br/>The civil right that I have been researching is the right to a fair trial. In this show, there are many examples of when there has and has not been an opportunity for a fair trial. For example, OJ was put into handcuffs at one point in time before the trial in the show. A cameraman captured the moment on video and soon the whole world saw him in handcuffs. Naturally, handcuffs are a symbol for guilt and wrong-doing, so if the whole world sees him, everyone assumes that he is guilty and it eliminates the possibility of remaining innocent until proved guilty. The media was all over the Simpson case before it even happened, and if the jury ruled another way, there very well could have been a huge outburst.<br/><br/>I chose to use this series for my subject because of many reasons. To start, this story is very famous, but I did not know a whole lot about it so it was interesting. I had heard allegations of O.J. Simpson killing his wife, but I wanted to hear more of the story. Also, I wanted to pick a story that was relevant and known so that I had background information, and this story was perfect for that. Although the story line might be interesting it does not come to its full right because of the chopped up episodes in random order. Why in heaven's sake not just tell the story in chronological order? I have seen many reenactments in which the actors looked nothing like the actual historical figures. In this series, every actor except the one portraying O.J. looked almost identical to the true-life person they portrayed. Very well cast and very well acted. John Travolta as Robert Shapiro gave a very convincing portrayal, as did the actor playing Johnnie Cochran. I refused to follow this farce of a trial when it originally happened back in the early 90s. This movie properly portrays how unjust the outcome (and the thinking of the jury) really was. . . . Four hours to arrive at a verdict?! The deck was stacked for "social justice" to prevail over true justice. The black prosecutor's statement that the trial was the first time a man was acquitted just because he was black was an excellent summary of what happened. The producers and director did an excellent job of making this ten-part series binge-watching worthy.<br/><br/>I did not appreciate all the foul language, but realize that such language was probably representative of the mouths of the persons portrayed. It is notable that the "church" within which Johnnie Cochran received his religious support had no problem asking their "god" to bless Johnnie as he attempted to help a murderer go free. Just as in many such churches, "solidarity" in getting back at "the man" trumps any transcendent truth the Bible they wave around may have in it. Such a shame, but again faithfully reported by this movie. Purely based on the acting skills and the story telling American Crime Story deserves a high rating. I watched the whole first season in a couple of days. From the first minute I was hooked on this show. The actors did an exceptional good job with their respective characters. But at the end of the show I was so angry, like I've never been before after watching a series. Even days after I am still angry. Angry about the whole American justice system. Angry about the obvious racism there was, and still is, in the law enforcement division. Angry how a trial becomes a media circus. I hated some characters so much, but in a good way. Not because of bad acting or so, Au contrary the acting was brilliant, but just because of the despicable humans they turned out to be. And to me those characters are Robert Shapiro, Johnnie Cochran, Mark Fuhrman and O.J. Simpson. Robert Shapiro because he's just a selfish disgusting person that will do anything, morally correct or not, to defend his client. Wrong or not, he will just try anything to hide the truth. Johnnie Cochran, that I respect for trying to defend the injustice minorities have to deal with, but in the Simpson case he's just as bad as the ones he accused before. Blaming everybody else for the murders of two innocent victims, just so he can get his moment of fame. He's a vile and disgusting person as well. Mark Furhman for being the racist cop he is. A guy that has chosen to be a law enforcer, and that obviously is not partial when the color of the skin is more important then the crimes they commit or not. He's a despicable human being that deserves of rotting in jail. And instead of that he has a job at Fox News. It doesn't even surprise me, when you know that the media, especially Fox, is as corrupt as the whole justice system in America. OJ Simpson, for the two faced liar he turned out to be. Him getting away with those murders is just scandalous. Him ending in jail in the future was just an inevitable thing, because he's just an evil human being. That he can get paroled in 2017 makes me sick. He should rot in jail until his last days on earth. I am a convinced atheist but for the first time in my life I wished there was a heaven and a hell. And then I wished all those people would rot in hell. Especially the jury, for acquitting a guilty murderer, just because the police force are racists. There is no way that OJ Simpson would get away with this in Europe after all the DNA evidence there was. The jury should be ashamed of themselves. I hope they rot in hell for what they did. The lawyers and media in America are disgusting. Trying to discrediting the prosecutor in the media has absolutely nothing to do with OJ Simpson and the murder case so playing that game is just disgusting. As well as portraying Cochran as a wife beater. Even if he is, it has nothing to do with the murder case, and so it should not be brought up. The whole media circus around some cases are a shame. Americans viewers are just voyeurs, happy to see the misery of others. It's a disgusting world but the series itself is brilliant. The level of violence in this series will shock anyone, no matter their age. There are different kinds of violence. You can fast-forward or mute scenes of the killings. You can't fast-forward or mute scenes of the emotional and psychological violence, which exists on two levels and from two sources.<br/><br/>I don't know how so affable and kind an actor as Daniel Criss obviously is could sustain the rage of narcissism required for the length of the series. This raging narcissism is emotionally violent from the first scene of Cunanan until the last. But second, the depiction of two class systems, one rich, one poor, deflects from 90's inequities regarding treatment of gay men. The opening montage of Gianni Versace in his last moments of life, the stunning splendor... was it meant to be offensive? It might not have seemed intended that way, if not for the fact that the series takes the designer's name for its title.<br/><br/>Flashback narration only heightens the series' dread. This choice of narration is sensational but extremely effective. However, the inclusion of Versace's back story, and the frigid, stagey presence of Penelope Cruz as Versace's sister, doesn't seem aimed at creating sympathy for the 1%'ers. And that made me wonder: exactly what was the point of this series? An indictment of obscene wealth? A chance to point out that obscenity works both ways?<br/><br/>If the series was meant to tell us that inequities create psychopathic monsters like Cunanan, it succeeded. But that's when this series becomes very troubling, because psychopathic killers aren't making statements about injustice when they're killing. They're just plain killing. To suggest even remotely this profoundly disturbing pre-millennium crime spree can be explained by anything other than bloodlust and narcissism is just plain wrong.<br/><br/>More respect would have been shown to Gianni Versace if the series had a different title, because in the end, never-ending scenes of the opulence he enjoyed tends not so subtly to argue for sympathy for a devil. The O J Simpson trial or the trial of the century captivated the curiosity and interest of so many Americans in the 90s. The American Crime Story drama has beautifully captured and accurately depicted the intensity and detail surrounding the case. From the close resemblances to the great performances by the whole cast this 10 episode drama more than delivers. Its not about the outcome but the execution and behind the scene drama that is so intriguing and beautifully laid out. It is not far fetched why this was referred to as the trial of the century. Highly recommended as each episode gets better as it goes on. <br/><br/>8.5/10 Yes, I remember exactly where I was when the white Bronco car chase was broadcast live to everyone's amazement. It was like watching a mystery unfold in real time. And then there was the trial, with its headline-grabbing sensationalism and the racial overtones.<br/><br/>I wanted to watch this dramatization to discover if it might be biased toward either the prosecution or the defense. After two episodes, I am pleased that the dramatizing, which is necessary, does not favor either side much.<br/><br/>For example, after the police call O.J. in Chicago and notify him of his ex-wife's death, we see O.J. sitting on the edge of the bed crying. No one witnessed his actions after the call. He might have been shaking uncontrollably. But it does not change the central truth of the story much either way.<br/><br/>The writers have done a good job to couch the narrative in the prevailing feelings of the time, especially with regard to the Rodney King case and the reactions of some citizens who rushed to judgment. One of the most noteworthy aspects of the case--and the thing that contributed greatly to the final verdict--was the way opinions were sidetracked by items of non-evidence. After the first episode it is obvious that O.J. is guilty if all one looks at is the evidence. The defense's only possible explanation for the evidence (before they even start looking at it) would be a story laughable for its convoluted assertions. <br/><br/>And yet, we know the final verdict. The defense kept asking the jury to watch one diversion after another (and ignore the hard evidence). Much of the public was likewise diverted from the consequential to the irrelevant. Even posters on this site still argue about O.J.'s motivations for the car chase and bigotry within the LAPD when those things are mere diversions from the voluminous evidence that was inarguable. And that is what makes this story so interesting. <br/><br/>The actors are doing an amazing job. Discussions about suitability of particular actors are understandable, but the real story is being told as much as one can determine. And even those who watched the entire story unfold years ago can learn more about the timeline and the "backstage" happenings. I am hoping the rest of this series is as devoted to reality.<br/><br/>Update 2/28/16: After four episodes, I am upping my grade to "9". This show is riveting. The only significant miscue so far is the miscasting of Cuba Gooding, Jr. as O.J. Not that his acting is bad, he just does not have the same presence that the real O.J. had, like his physicality or his smug demeanor. Some of the other actors are really channeling their real-life counterparts, like Courtney Vance as Johnny Cochran. Title should be - To All the Boys Ive Killed Before As the O.J. Simpson trial unfolded, over the better part of a year, I was evidently of the age (14) where it just dragged on interminably. Every day the local news would have an update, more boring courtroom footage, etc. Honestly, the wicked jabs on "Seinfeld" over the years were more memorable to me. I'm just saying this because that's where I've stood for almost twenty years. It's never been something I wanted to revisit.<br/><br/>But you put together a cast like this, and even a I'll end up caving. No way around it.<br/><br/>That's the first thing that's impressive about "American Crime Story": they spared no expense in the casting department; every single player in the trial is a name actor.<br/><br/>But it's also the occasional song placement, every one of which takes me back to the mid-'90s. Even "Kiss From a Rose", but that can return from whence it came. It's little touches here and there that really brought 1995 roaring back. That's not cheap, either.<br/><br/>And getting back to the cast, they're all excellent, but it's especially Sarah Paulson and Courtney B. Vance. Marcia Clark and Johnnie Cochran are the most important characters in this, and they're essential to bringing them to life. Oddly enough, it's Cuba Gooding Jr. that's, well, the weak link. His O.J. Simpson is always amped to the point of frenzy, emotions at surface in in full victim mode. It's out of place.<br/><br/>But even with that exception, this proved to be a highly-addictive series. The writing was always engrossing, the acting top-notch and succeeded (completely) in drawing me right into the courtroom drama.<br/><br/>There's nothing subtle about Ryan Murphy, but I'd recommend this to anyone.<br/><br/>9/10 How do you make an 8 hour movie where everyone knows the ending and NOT bore the audience? They did it here with this first rate production.<br/><br/>This is based on the book by Toobin that i read years ago and they stuck with the book and did not take sides. Simpson is neither monster nor martyr in this movie. Gooding plays him as a rather dim-witted man who may or may not have done it.<br/><br/>Everyone was excellent but esp the guy who played judge Ito. He physically looked just like him and also behaved just like the Ito i remember from 20 years ago. At the end of the movie, they said Ito never wrote a book about this case while everyone else in the case did. I watched the entire original trial and even wrote letters after the acquittal to the Goldmans, Marcia and Chris, I think the Browns too. Anyway the most enjoyable thing about this production is the back story. The actors seem well cast with one exception. Cuba Gooding may be a very good actor but he is no O.J. He is too small and not nearly as handsome or charming or charismatic as O.J. was.<br/><br/>It is fun to watch and learn of the machinations of the defense team. If Marcia Clark was truly suffering the kind of domestic problems as portrayed here she was clearly miscast as lead prosecutor. But Sarah Paulson does a good job.<br/><br/>The murders, the trial, the broncho chase, the lifestyle, etc. I know and knew so in a way I am probably not the usual viewer. It is the private lives of the attorneys and their lifestyles and strategy sessions that interested me the most.<br/><br/>I was at the time and remain completely convinced of Simpson's guilt. Dont get all that buzz.. It wasnt that remarkable, kinda ok. Hope 2season be better, if not, this was a waste of my time.. I was force to give a five star rating, and that is generous, because of season 1. The acting/casting was so bad I had to give up half way through episode 3. On the other hand, I finished season 2 in two night. If I was rating them separately, season 1 would get one star while season 2 would get nine stars. The People v .J. Simpson: American Crime Story (Season 1)<br/><br/>How much the amazing real story. That after hearing that Nicole Brown was beaten to death at home, the main suspect is, her husband, O.J. Simpson, acclaimed national sportsman and idol of the black race. The prosecution, led by Marcia Clark (Sarah Paulson) takes letters in this and sues O.J. Of murder. The defense headed by Robert Shapiro (John Travolta) also takes letters in this, hiring a great team of lawyers headed by Johnnie Cochran (Courtney B. Vance). And during passionate 10 chapters will know the jury's decision.<br/><br/>Let's start with the actors. Sarah Paulson as Marcia Clark is a hero of the series, well deserved her Golden Globe for best actress in a television series. John Travolta as Robert Shapiro is also a very good ace, but not as much as Sarah Paulson. Cuba Gooding Jr. as O.J. Simpson, or Orenthal James Simpson, is another assert. The guy has personality, in court when there is a joke or an ingenious play (or TDFW for people of this time) he laughs or he just laughs. At the beginning of the series was weird, says that it was not the killer, but everything indicates that it was the. Courtney B. Vance as Johnnie Cochran is another of the stars in the series. The guy has personality as well as seriousness and protects his (the blacks).<br/><br/>What I liked the most about the series is that I did not lean on one side of the scale. I also liked how they used social pressure as something evil. In one chapter they name the word "Nigger" and the trial turns round, the lawyers made a mute scream, the jury, the spectators, even the judge.<br/><br/>So Real 7/10 When it comes to cutting edge dramas, no one does it well like FX. The first entry in the American Crime Story series, the People vs. OJ Simpson, recreates the moments when OJ fled the scene of a murder in one of the most popular crime stories of all time. There are some changes to make it different from real life, but the casting is well done and the way its shot is good. The music and soundtrack is well done, and Cuba Gooding Jr. is pretty good as OJ. I'm sure FX will do good with the story based on Hurricane Katrina and its impact on America. I think it's better than American Horror Story and more educational for young people like me. Powerful and brilliantly acted, American Crime Story Season 1 will keep you hooked from start to finish. Even though the subject is already well known and has been analyzed so many times, the series manages to take you deep into the story from the perspective of the people that actively participated: The prosecution, the defense team, the judge and the jury, showing the emotional roller-coaster of everyone involved, but also presenting interesting details of the case. It also managed to capture the whole vibe surrounding the trial, be it the media or just the man on the street.<br/><br/>Excellent acting, especially by Sarah Paulson (Marcia Clark), Courtney B. Vance (Johnnie Cochran) and Sterling K. Brown (Chris Darden). Those three really shined, exceptional job. I also liked Travolta as Shapiro, despite the mixed reactions that his performance has received.<br/><br/>Only minus was the portrayal of OJ himself. Cuba Gooding, although a great actor, was horribly miscast for the role, and despite his best efforts (there were times that he did succeed), most of the time he didn't look or sound anything like the real Simpson. High-pitched voice, shorter statue, smaller frame, didn't really fit. I'm really baffled as to how they managed to do such a good job with the casting regarding everyone else but OJ Simpson. The People v O.J. Simpson has one good thing going for it by the makers. They just decided to for camp with the constant mentions of the Kardashian's with David Schwimmer's permanently pensive look as Robert Kardashian and Travolta's botoxed face and eyebrows that had a life of its own.<br/><br/>OJ Simpson a former football player turned colour commentator and actor in the popular The Naked Gun series of films was accused of murdering his ex wife and and her boyfriend.<br/><br/>Ever since OJ tried to flee in his white Ford Bronco the case attracted frenzied media attention and the trial was closely followed by the media and public as personalities emerged and quickly parodied such as The Dancing Ito's on The Tonight Show.<br/><br/>As for the trial itself Travolta's Robert Shapiro is quickly sidelined by Courtney B Vance's Johnny Cochrane who is more wily, assured and willing to fight dirty whereas Shapiro is looking to cut a deal.<br/><br/>The trial itself and its mechanics is interesting with jury selection being key and also the stress put on the jurors that one of the episode concentrates on.<br/><br/>Cuba Gooding Jr while not having the physical size of the real OJ does well in portraying his shallowness and even his dumbness.<br/><br/>The makers of this ten part series just played up the absurdness of the trial. Although at first glance it looked like the Prosecution had a water tight case, they were too cocky and the police made too many mistakes inn the crime scene. This is shown up when OJ tries on the glove, a crucial moment in the trial. I remember that part myself watching it live on TV. It is then you find yourself thinking that he may not be guilty of the crime.<br/><br/>Yet the person who they should had concentrated more on and he only had a minor role in the television dramatisation was Barry Schenk. His dismantling of the technical forensic evidence was a sight to behold for those who watched the trial live. <br/><br/>At the end OJ was found not guilty but a persona non grata in his beloved LA neighbourhood. Just note how Simpson is walking around his celebration party on his own followed by the assigned magazine photographer. No one wants to know him.<br/><br/>The series ends wanting us to remember the real victims of the crime. Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman. I'm very glad that I watched this show because it was very well done. It was able to keep me entertained fully by it throughout most of the episodes, and it did very well in a few aspects. I had a couple concerns with it before watching the show, but most of them were negated, and what I got was a very pleasant and enjoyable experience.<br/><br/>This TV show represents a complete timeline of the entire O.J. Simpson trials from beginning to end. It showed when he was arrested for the crime he was convicted of, it showed both of the lawyers trying to find evidence to back up both of their sides, it showed them presenting their evidence in court, and finally, it showed the jury's verdict at the last episode. Each episode talked about a major event which happened during the trials.<br/><br/>One of my concerns with the show was that it would favor one side, and negatively represent the other side. Since most of the show was from Johnnie Cochran's side, I had this concern. However, the show didn't favor one side. It represented both sides equally, and it did not make it appear as if it was trying to favor one side. The show detailed all of the factual events, and it listed everything which really happened. If something would happen to either side which could lessen their chances of winning, all of those instances would be justified considering that those events really happened. It's great that the show was unbiased, and that it allowed you to decide what side you agreed with. It's great for a Biography show on a topic like this to have this feature.<br/><br/>Also, the acting in really good. Courtney B. Vance as Johnnie Cochran delivered a great performance. When he is in the courtroom, you can tell that he is trying to make his performance sound as realistic as possible. It sounds like he's trying to be as strong, firm, and persistent as possible when he speaks in court in order to make an impression on the jury. It sounds like he's incredibly determined to win. Also, Sarah Paulson as Marcia Clark gave a gripping performance as well. While Courtney B. Vance's performance works for being strident, Sarah Paulson goes for a bit more relaxed approach. When she speaks in Court, she sounds firm, but she gets her points across in a way which sometimes shows charisma. Also, Cuba Gooding Jr. as O.J. Simpson gave a great performance. He undergoes a significant change throughout the show. In the first few episodes, he is very worried and depressed. In fact, he almost kills himself. However, as the episodes go on, he becomes more confident in himself, and he shows less fear. Cuba Gooding Jr.'s performance does a great job showing this. Other lead actors gave great performances which carried the show as well. These actors include Sterling K. Brown as Christopher Darden, John Travolta as Robert Shapiro, and Kenneth Choi as Judge Lance Ito. Although they don't leave as big of an impression as the ones I elaborated on above did, they still deliver convincing reactions and emotions, and they help to carry the show as well. All in all, the acting was very good.<br/><br/>Also, a great thing which Biographies like this show should have is to represent an accurate description of whatever subject that they're about. This also applies for capturing how the characters acted in real life. I feel like this should be mandatory for most shows to have. From what I heard, all of the episodes are actually very accurate. There may be a couple minor errors that you could find here and there, but I've yet to find any, and to my knowledge, it is very spot-on. Occasionally, it even captures some minor details that other people might leave out if they had created this show instead.<br/><br/>There isn't much for me to criticize with this show as it was a very pleasant experience. However, there was one issue I had with the show. I felt like some parts to certain episodes went on a bit longer than they needed to. Also, some parts lingered on certain aspects a little longer than they needed to. There wasn't too much slow parts for me to describe the show as overly drawn out, but there were enough for me to have a criticism here. Often, when the 2 teams of lawyers would be searching for evidence, they would make those scenes take up a huge portion of that particular episode's running time. They would also sometimes show a very short segment of the shows running time with the 2 teams of lawyers in court for some of the episodes. I kind of wished that this was reversed because I enjoyed the scenes in court a lot more. Hey, I would've even been okay if the time spent in and out of court was half and half. However, this isn't a real major flaw I had because this criticism only applied for a few episodes as most episodes were actually very engaging.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I really liked this show. Obviously, it's not perfect since some episodes suffer from being drawn out. Also, I felt like some scenes went on longer than they needed to. However, I liked most other parts to this show, and I thought that it was a very well made show. It is unbiased, it represents an accurate portrayal of the events depicted on the show, and the acting is really good coming from all main performances in the show. I'm looking forward to a season 2 to this. I'm hoping that the future seasons will be able to improve on the concept represented in this show, fix the minor flaws and learn from mistakes made here, and to make future seasons even better and entertaining. I am not American and at the time of OJ's trial I was otherwise engaged, therefore I knew next to nothing about this sordid history.<br/><br/>It's clear the the racial issue is still boiling hot in the States and the way it was confronted in this series shows some courage. Unfortunately, the message received out and clear is that those who belong to a certain race, can get away with murder to avoid further racial tension.<br/><br/>Besides, the pressure of the media, compounded with the obsession with celebrity makes the atmosphere of this whole tragedy surreal and nauseating.<br/><br/>We've certainly reached an advanced state of moral bankruptcy and the situation just seems to be getting worse. It is so intriguing that i didn't want to stop watching. The courtroom, the D.A. office, the 'dream team' meeting in any scene holds you to listen to every sentence in a conversation and look at every expression or emotions showed on anyone's face. Because everything is related, if not, it is definitely important.<br/><br/>The best thing about this series can be that is does not directly points a finger at anyone, not the defenders not the dream team, it just reflects how everyone who were related to the trial was affected. Adding some good actors and mind blowing music, what more do you need.<br/><br/>It was fast paced as well. I was not at all bored at any point, and it was based on a very famous case which i think is important to know about. This season, the people vs O.J.Simpson, was well executed. Cuba Gooding Jr. was so convincing that I thought for a second I was staring at the Juice's hind parts. If the movie _Idiocracy_ ever comes true, I hope that scene becomes the Oscar winning film.<br/><br/>And what can I say about David Schwimmer? He jumps down your throat as perfectly deplorable and awful, standing in as the dumb-downed American who knows things only through the media. Is it this 10 episode series or the events themselves that predict the advent of a change in media, where trial by media replaces trial by jury? Schwimmer is so, so, so Kardashian!<br/><br/>Bravo, _American Crime Story_, for blurring the lines between fiction and reality by an additional level. And oh, by the way, as I'm sure others have already said, Mr. Vance nailed it! It should win an award. Behold a barrage of superlatives - superbly written, brilliantly acted, aptly cast, breathtakingly paced; all while capturing some of the most intensely dramatic moments on TV. <br/><br/>O.J.Simpson's controversial trial is one of the most covered cases in the media during its time and had an on-going pop culture presence through out. Most people involved in this case have penned some best sellers based on this episode leaving plenty of perspective and gossip out in the open - a primary fodder for this amalgamation. Popular football player O.J. Simpson is the prime accused in a double homicide including his wife Nicole and a 25 yr. old Goldman. He puts together a dream team of the most accomplished lawyers that money can buy who overcomes their infighting and egos to defend their client.<br/><br/>First thing that strikes you is its bold content and next is the sensitive and unbiased handling of that content all the while walking a very tightrope. They managed to include perspectives from all the people involved as well as different cross-sections of the society. The screenplay is bright, upbeat and doesn't wander; much. A revelation was Courtney B. Vance's portrayal of central character Johnnie Cochran which is the heart and soul of the drama and ably supported by John Travolta as Robert Shapiro as a character who gets sidelined in the dream team he created. Travolta has always been an over achiever considering his limited acting capabilities and his bad botox work doesn't help much. Cuba Gooding Jr. as O.J. Simpson fits in well as a likable superstar celebrity who makes the audience root for his character despite overwhelming evidence against him. Rest of the huge ensemble cast is well selected and they do their job perfectly.<br/><br/>Despite knowing the outcome and sometimes the most intricate details about this case already from other media available in the open, the series succeeds in maintaining the palpable dramatic tension, adds in some unknown facts, perspectives and opinions to keep it interesting. <br/><br/>A highly sensitive and popular story given the treatment as it originally played out - entertainment first!! How did this series get such a high rating? Boring and waaaaay too long, as well as poor performances. OJ is miscast. Schwimmer is completely unbelievable, and Travolta comes off looking like an idiot. I could not take more than 2 episodes. Unless you like to watch Sarah Paulson chain smoke throughout (big tobacco-financed garbage) avoid it. Really enjoyed Penelope Cruz performance as Donatella, sister of Gianni. She was excellent in the movie even getting the strange way the real person talks and the strange mouth movements and small clicks. She was good... I wanted to date her! Deciding factor was seeing she had gone back to her plastic surgeon in real life to upgrade the beautiful twin cans on her chest!
Character playing Andrew also did a good job because 5 minutes in and I was hoping that someone, anyone would smack him right in his stupid face and send some teeth flying! He's beyond annoying, pretentious and just completely full of sh!+... he's very hard to keep looking at which means he's doing a good job playing the part. If the real guy was a tenth as obnoxious as the actor playing him was... I don't know how he didn't get his teeth kicked in everyday!
Overall, good series to watch if you're bored but like other reviewers mentioned, watch the series in reverse starting with number 8 down to number 1 and then watch number 9 last. It will make more sense and be easier to follow that way. You're welcome! Cuba Gooding Jr as OJ...? Travolta resembling Schwarzenegger...? Really?
This series is too slow paced, and tries to add irrelevant details and characters, in order to fill its 10 episodes. There is a decent cast here (Sarah Paulson, Kenneth Choi and Sterling K. Brown were great, David Schwimmer was better than expected), but the screenplay is hideous! I expect most people know the story already, so there are no surprises here, but the scenes are mostly boring. Travolta is mostly burlesque, Courtney B. Vance is overplayed, and Cuba Gooding Jr is simply a travesty in this role - not credible at all. Disclaimer: this review is solely based on the second series of the show.<br/><br/>This is some of the worst acting I've ever seen -and my standards for network television are already LOW. Although the narrative is compelling and cohesive, the melodramatic tone to the writing (exacerbated by the poor delivery of the actors) made for moments of cringe and laughter which should've instead come across as tense or meaningful. There are clues as to its potential: superb style, subject matter, etc. but does it redeem Criss's (as Cunanan) atrocious acting? It's a resounding NO. As much as I was thrilled by the first season, the second disappointed me so much. the OJ season had everything it takes for a good narration: from an interesting story spanning multiple levels of action to an ensemble of actors working together.
the Versace season, on the other hand, is as good as told after the second episode. the consistent narration of the murderer's story from the end to the beginning simply leads to the fact that we already know everything essential and only get it in detail again and again, episode after episode. all other characters of the season remain marginal figures. they should have name it "the assassin of Gianni Versace" not "the assassination...". This is a story about killer Andrew C Not Ganni Versace...
It is difficult to watch such damaged mind... The second season was off puttings, since it was more about David than Versace. It was interesting to watch non the less, it had better photography and ambient music compared to the first season. I also enjoyed the creepy atmosphere, but still, Versace who? Would be fantastic,BUT Cuba Gooding acting is really bad and this makes it 7 stars instead of 10. Would have helped if they had used professionals for all the roles instead of just Lane and Travolta and the guy who played Furhman. Guess they ran out of money when they got to casting Simpson, hired a cheap, bad one for that role, and after that decided just to role with the principals. Only they can't ACT. Sure the anti-aging stuff was miraculous. Should bottle and sell it. Can make a fortune. From various news sources, Fred Goldman was asked to respond to the show, its actors and its production. He responded critically stating that the show did not focus on the victims, he was not consulted, and the actors playing on OJ's team should be ashamed. While he owns the right to express such criticism, perhaps Mr. Goldman can take some solace in larger lessons about his son's role in the case. <br/><br/>Clearly, OJ's defense team won that case based on appeals to vindicate systematic racism within LAPD, given the revelations from Mark Fuhrman and the unhealed wounds from the Rodney King beating and trial. But it is only with so powerful a force that the otherwise dispositive evidence of OJ's guilt in that case could be offset and overcome. Thus, Ron (and Nicole) are fairly viewed as tragic but real sacrifices for the greater cause of combatting racism. Put another way, how much reputational harm, loss of prestige and subsequent reform did LAPD have to undergo after the OJ fiasco, given that it singularly lost the most high profile case of the 20th century – and saw Ron and Nicole's murders publicly, shockingly and painfully unvindicated – because of necessary political compensation for LAPD's history of wrongs against minorities.<br/><br/>Few people can claim that they taxed the forces of racism so heavily. By participating in the show – which by all accounts was brilliantly done – all actors, producers and other individuals deserve praise for keeping alive the memory of how expensive racism can be. <br/><br/>Ron Goldman and Nicole Brown are the murdered currency by which those lessons are perpetuated through time, by public reminders like the TV show in question. For the family of the victims, while the pain of loss and injustice can never be erased and perhaps not even mitigated, the perception that Ron died needlessly can be offset by the reality that the price his death exacted against the forces of racism was as steep and as glorious as anyone could dream.<br/><br/>Benjamin Pavone, Esq. Civil Rights Attorney The People vs. OJ Simpson accurately depicted what America experienced in 1994 and 1995. FX did a great job in portraying the emotional element that made this case so monumental. What FX didn't do is pick quality actors and actresses for this TV series.<br/><br/>The good...<br/><br/>I felt that Courtney B. Vance, who played Johnnie Cochran, was the best character in this show and really put forth an astounding amount of effort to give justice to the real Mr. Cochran and anyone who fought for racial equality at the time. His persona and motivation created a driving character that thrusted this show into success.<br/><br/>Kenneth Choi, who played Judge Lance Ito, was also very respectable and played his role extremely well. While he was not allowed to show much emotion as a judge, his subtle gestures and authoritative stance propelled the show throughout the series.<br/><br/>The bad...<br/><br/>Cuba Gooding Jr. played OJ Simpson. I felt that he did not properly embody the correct personality and defining characteristics that made OJ who he really was. Gooding lacked proper emotion at times and failed to portray and accurate depiction of the real OJ Simpson.<br/><br/>John Shapiro, who was played by John Travolta, was a complete nightmare. Travolta needs to stick to Tarantino movies, not crime dramas. The amount of makeup he wore was tremendous and embarrassingly comparable to the skin complexion of Donald Trump. His acting did not fit the bill for the role, and ultimately became a huge distraction in the story development and overall show.<br/><br/>Marcia Clark, played by Sarah Paulson, was a very unlikeable character. She did have a few good moments in the show, but her personality made it nearly impossible to root for her.<br/><br/>Overall, I felt that this show had very good writing and directing, but definitely needed some work with character selection and development. This show highlighted a key issue that was felt during the time of this trial and even to this day, and that is racial inequality. Including this topic allows the viewers to reflect on how we viewed this issue over 20 years ago, and how we view it today. Sadly, it has not changed much. It will be interesting to see how this issue will evolve in the next 20 years. After 20 plus years the gawker effect still lingers with this terrible case. Terrible because many us wanted justice for the handsome Ron Goldman and the beautiful Nicole Brown who were brutally killed. Their families agony is still painful to watch and their outrage over the show is expected. As we know Hollywood is not very original most of the time so taking a page from past history and giving it a fresh spin seems like business as usual. Based on the book by attorney Jeffrey Toobin viewers learn more about what went on behind the scenes with Simpson's dream team and the other legal players in the trial of the century. Casting is interesting but not surprising given Ryan Murphy is one of the producers; he has a flair for giving forgotten actors a second life.
