The more u watch it.. the dumber it gets.. idea of the plot is good. Direction is just like a soap opera. Well, the writers and producers outdone themselves.
They started with a good idea, intriguing characters and an elaborate plot.
By the end of season 2 it became apparent they could not drag this anymore.
Season 3 was just a "remake" of season 1 but, my God, season 4 is an awful soap opera...seems almost like a "filler" season...no actual plot, no actual action...you could skip straight to episode 7 if u want and still..you wouldnt miss a thing.
Hire better writers, because this cast is impeccable. I really only write reviews when I feel like a show is getting way too much of praise or way too little.
I love heist movies/series. So it makes sense that I would finally end up watching this one. But let me warn you, other heist lovers, this is a soap opera not a heist story. I'm 6 episodes in now (probably wont be a 7th) and it's just annoying the hell out of me. The characters are unbelievably stupid, doing things that even people like us, who aren't actually career criminals, would never do. And what is the reason for this stupidity? LOVE! Or, maybe I should say crushes? Criminals loving criminals, criminals loving hostages and every other combination. These are people who have lost it all and want everything, and then drop the whole plan and do ridiculous thing when a girl/boy smiles at them sweetly.
I know that I'm very late to reviewing this thing (as it already has multiple seasons) but if my words can save someone 6 hours of their life, it will be worth it. I sadly won't be getting that time back.
it's a 2/10 stars for me (but I put 3/10 believing that people are more likely to ignore the very low score reviews, and I aim to protect you people) :D
Take care! :) I had heard so many good things about this show. The most watched show in Europe, Spain's biggest ever viewing figures etc. Then from a promising start the program just gets more and more ridiculous. Now I know it's just apiece of entertaining fictional drama but half the skill in making a show like this is to get the audience to think as far fetched as the plot is a part of you would like to think it could be done.<br/><br/>The show makes the perpetrators and the police look as stupid and as dumb as each other. You get robbers falling in love and having sex, robbers having sex with hostages and wait for it the mastermind behind the robbery having sex with the chief inspector in charge of the police operation. The plot has more holes than a second hand dart board. Only the production value and some good set pierces save this from one star. 3/10 Well to be honest very disappointed in the season, I was waiting for this season since the end of season 3<br/><br/>So we started the season inside the bank, ended inside the bank.. and what's the progress? Dead Nairobi<br/><br/>That's about it, and I made my peace with Nairobi since last season dead, for some reason they decided to bring her back to life to kill her again at the end of this season<br/><br/>Punch of hugs, cries and completely unnecessary past scenes that were extremely boring<br/><br/>Gandia standing in the middle of the hallway surrounded by 4 of them shooting automatic weapons and he still stand, breaks out of his cuffs and leave Rio as if he is going to a picnic<br/><br/>So if you look logically at the season, you gained absolutely nothing from 8 episodes, just unnecessary stretch filled with unnecessary events, scenes and past scenes<br/><br/>An idiot decided to help Gandia out the assassin! As if he didnt know how to break out of his cuffs alone! Then he is back in command again! Forgotten and forgiving! Coffin that would stop an assault! A police man that made no sense after jumping off the 4th storey building to agree to join them and giving them all the Intel they need! And a crazy detective who figures it all out from scenes that were put on repeat that she did not see!<br/><br/>End of the day.. very disappointing, stretched out and unnecessary season where they could have ended the story there but yet to wait for another season "maybe"<br/><br/>In my opinion they could break lisbon out in the first 2 episodes, had the Gandia drama in 1 episode, dropped the bomb over few different episodes insead of cramping them in 1 and ended the story there<br/><br/>And what to expect next season? Another stretched out season to finish a series that could have easily be finished this season With a 100% positive critics rating on Rotten Tomatoes and with many of my friends going crazy for it, my opition might not be very popular. But I find La Casa de Papel (Money Heist) to be utterly ridiculous, overly melodramatic and just plain stupid. Professor what are we robbing in season 3-4-5? Professor: People Will think we are robbing the bank of Spain, However wee are actually going to rob the viewers of their time, we will insult their intellect with every scene and episode, make them cringe and want to kill themselves with unnecessary gay drama, show them some of the most unrealistic action the world has seen. And that way we will rob them of their time. THE BIGGEST HEIST IN MANKID!!!!! This series should have ended in season 2, season 3 and 4 totally unnecessary A band of robbers, lead by a man known simply as 'the Professor', infiltrate and rob the Spanish National Mint. They appear to bungle it, ending up holed up in the Mint with 67 hostages. But it's all part of the Professor's plan. If it succeeds, they'll make off with over $2 billion Euros.<br/><br/>Entertaining, initially, and could have been a masterpiece. The initial plot - the plan to secure the Mint and make off with over $2 billion Euros - was very clever and intriguing. It was also engaging: you got to know the individual characters of the heisters, as well as who they were up against. From here on I expected a taught, gritty battle of wits and wills between the robbers and the police.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, that didn't happen. Instead of being tight, the plot diverged into silly escapades. One escapade lead to another: robber has to fix some error, fixes it, unwittingly causes another issue, now has to fix that, rinse and repeat. What's worse, the errors, solutions and escapades were incredibly implausible, just being antics for action sake.<br/><br/>In addition, having established their characters in the first few episodes, the robbers then do several things counter to their characters. It was as if the writers wrote each scene independent of what had happened before. It could not have been more random if they brought in a different writer for each episode, and told them not to read the scripts of the previous episodes.<br/><br/>The further into the series one went, the worse it got. During the first season the good, clever plot developments generally outweighed the random, implausible, stupid ones. By Season Two it was open season, with dumb stuff being the norm. The dumb plot developments became predictable, eg you have a situation where a character has a choice and the logical thing, the thing people would do 100% of the time in real life, is to do A. However, A would mean the series ends, so the character does B, and the series continues.<br/><br/>So the plot only makes sense if you're mind-bogglingly stupid.<br/><br/>By the end I just wanted it to be over, so my intelligence would no longer be insulted. And yet it still got drawn out, by about 2-3 episodes too many.<br/><br/>And apparently there's a Season 3 in the works. Considering how it ended, not sure how that's possible, but the producers did manage to turn what should have been a 8-or-so episode mini-series into a 2-season, 22-episode series. I've started watching this as the idea sounded interesting with quite some potential when seeing a series filmed in Europe. But, my God, the characters do loose touch with reality and common sense already during season one. By mid season two I could no longer see this. In all honesty, do we really have to have the "bad guys" completely useless when enforcing something, taking revenge or even facing each other? Do we really have all the women in this series falling flat on their backs, in love with the perps? And does the Spanish Police, in real life, act like this? Meaning...will an arrest happen when the perp surrenders as he gets bored from being caught 10x? Another soap opera that disappoints more by creating actually an expectation to get something different... I really dont get it, what do these high ratings see in this series. This is the most dumbest heist i have ever seen. You plan something for years, you train people for months and then what? During the heist they fight among themselves? Forced soap opera level drama in a heist story. Dumbest series ever! I have never been more confused by a high rating for a show. Not a single part of it is well executed. The acting is not good, the writing is much much worse. None of the characters behave remotely like real people.... it's a mess. It's basically looney toons robbing a bank, but somehow very sad and excruciatingly boring. This series gives a lot of big messages.
First of all, Dali masks are not an ordinary choice. Dali is a genius painter who inherited life that is contrary to popular morality and common customs. He has never accepted the imperatives from the society and the right to wrong moral codes. The masks represent this irregularity.<br/><br/>Red overalls represent socialism. The wearers are socialist comrades and fighting. Mint and cops represent capitalism. In capitalism money sets everything. Even morals will set money. So when someone attacks the money, those people are declared bad. When attacked by money, capitalism is waging a war against the attackers with its armed and visual mechanisms.<br/><br/>The professor is symbolizing the scientific perspective and accounting. After all, scientific thinking and accountability overcome all kinds of problems. But love succumbs.<br/><br/>I have not seen such meaningful socialism for a long time. Moreover, Salvador Dali's tactic was used in the series. You think you are watching the events, but every time you have a deep meaning and message. Ciao Bella is the symbol of socialism.<br/><br/>Fabulous work. It's not just a movie or a script. It is a wonderful work as a philosophy. There is a great slap in the capitalist system. 10/10 Is Spanish police/administration this dumb as shown in the series then 'god help them'.
From the logic behind the robbery that "we are not stealing from people but just printing our own money" is also one of the dumbest logic applied in the history of heist movies/series. Have they even heard of a word "inflation"?.
I wasted my 10- 15 hrs watching season 1 and 2.
If you are a guy/girl who watches lot of quality movies/series then please don't waste you time on this. I'm not sure why this show is highly rated. Really disappointing. Had a good concept for a storyline but the it felt like it was directed in the 80s. Superficial dialogue and character relationships. Every opportunity to exploit the female characters is taken. Lots if man-handling and over sexualisation. It's all a bit cheap. Too much relationship storyline. I just really wanted a heist show. The premise was awesome but diluted to become a soap opera with a heist backdrop. Too bad This is a soap opera, looks like a smart tv show but it's a latin soap opera and you watch it like that(50% brain turned off, the logic part) Season 1 and 2 were great and amazing, I'd say 9/10. But then Netflix saw a chance to make money and prolongued this show into 2 unnecessary seasons that completely ruined this show. I'm just sick and tired of this by Netflix. This last season was a disaster, filled with unrealistic stuff.
Stop before it's too late. Over-acting from every single idiotic character who all do idiotic things for reasons unfathomable to any normal functioning human on the face of the earth.
I couldn't handle more than 3 episodes of the first season. That is a chunk of my life I'll never get back!
Save yourself and avoid. If they could have stopped in season 2, this series would have been the best ever heist series that's ever made. But they didn't do it and season 3 and season 4 is meaningless and boring. Not convincing and illogical. Like everything in this generation, I discovered this TV show through hype. It was going viral, on my Netflix home screen, on twitter, everywhere. So, I decided to give it a try. I feel disappointed I wasted my time on this show. I'm not a fan of fantasy shows like Spiderman, Superman, Batman etc. Honey Heist is a mirror image of super hero movies, difference being the crew here is a bunch of bad guys. I'm not a fan of fantasy shows because of the imbalance, one side is extremely strong, smart, has all the powers available right on time and other side is simply dumb. In this show too, it's the same, the cops are dumb and incompetent. The cops in this show have all the equipment, fancy gears, intelligence power, yet they screw up worse than a third world country cops, not once but multiple times, come on, are the Spanish cops really that bad? Could the makers not make is somewhat believable? The Royal Mint of Spain is under siege and the top cop is going on a dinner date? Having an affair with the main accused? Oh my, that is some level of soap opera right there. And to top it off they dragged what could have been a mini-series to 4 seasons. Learned my lesson, don't jump on the hype wagon, do your research before wasting time on something like this again. The real heist is by the writers who keep stalling for more time with more nonsense episodes while Netflix prints money.<br/><br/>First season had promise. But shortly into the season characters start making flatout preternatural connections especially inspector Raquel. Which she corrects by missing the most obvious ones. 6 episodes in... coming out of a hazy binge stupor because your wife keeps pressing next... you realize... wait... they expect us to believe all this happens in 3 days. People recover from gunshot wounds as if they were scratches. Of course, everyone forgives and forgets. Love stories happen when someones sneezes. Investigations are mobilized across all of Spain with such immediacy and the realtime forensics of our dreams. Then the typical "we have the all important lab results - i knew he was the guy - but your voicemail is now full - and I'm the jaded drunk lover about to have an accident/coma routine - let me call your selectively Alzheimers mother." If only his twin would show up.... Professor Palpatine's plan then everything would be proceeding as he's forseen. If we still had TV guide this show would be on at 11 am after "the View." I got fooled because they didn't shoot it in live camera format with dramatic face to face pauses, watery eyes, and breakaways to commercial (remember those). Music is pretty good. I can go on... but then I would be an accomplice perpetuating the real crime of taking your time with this show (like the writers!)<br/><br/>Watch no more than two episodes to get the gist/hype then make your escape! The basic idea of holding mint with hostage was fine and some excitement generated at times and some style. But that's it !!! A low grade stuff besides that<br/><br/>Bad direction and complete lack of attention to details. Just some examples:<br/><br/>1. Flaw in philosophy: The group is shown as quite innocent who only steals with the justification that big banks steal too. With professor trying to kill inspector's mother, the inspector coming out of coma and group shooting recklessly on police who is doing their job, and then keeping simple people hostage, where is that innocence??<br/><br/>2. Technical Flaws:
<ul><li>Biggest one: While the professor is so super intelligent, police seems to be utter stupid that knowing such a big some of money is being stolen, police doesn't have any helicopter on stand-by, nor they lock down the city knowing group is exiting,</li><li>main inspector taking her boyfriend to crime scene and within the barricaded area</li><li>main inspector dating around in an intense operation of 5 days</li><li>the group seems to have everything inside the factory: plush sofas, coffins, candles to decorate the dead</li><li>how the hell did they leave the city and the country is never shown with police knowing they are on the run (I guess somehow one has to assume with the great brilliance of the professor, they had a way and the police is anyway stupid)</li><li>In open firing inside the mint which is happening in an aisle of say 3 meter width, while commandos have shield (and hoping they are experts in encounter) and the group doesn't, not even a single heist member is injured !!!!! Are you kidding me?</li></ul><br/><br/>3. Ridiculous acting and presentation of main characters:
<ul><li>The main inspector in charge of such a big operation shown to be highly unprofessional, weak in character and stupid to take on the criminal alone every time</li><li>Most of the gang which is supposedly from not so well off background, has great personality, attitude, drink and eat like they have been taught etiquette, even snobbishness at times</li></ul><br/><br/>And now the funny part: The main inspector being a clear suspect in being accomplice, somehow lives on the life peacefully with no investigation or charges brought on and then leaves the country to Philippines !!!! Season 1 and season 2 were 9/10 for me. However season 3 was meh and season 4 pretty meh except the two last episodes.Unfortunately, an other show netflix destroyed because of it's success.. It really started okay, but was way drug out. Season 1 was clever. After that, the flashbacks became annoying. The characters became unlikable. How many times do you need to pull guns on each other? Season 3 was a confusing cartoon. Heist was stupid and really made no sense at all. Watch it if you have the extra time but its not better than a 5. Most of the characters are bunch of stupid silly losers in a nervously way.. This is just an average series which is dragged dragged and dragged. After 2 episodes you will feel, why don't they end this soon. Could have finished the first 2 seasons in 2 hrs. Apart from Berlin, professor, all other characters act very bad. It's rubbish. Period. The problem is that the show takes itself very seriously but ends up becoming a caricature of itself. I have no reservations towards mindless entertainment but the sheer audacity of the writers to pull anything off from their hat under the pretext of a mastermind professor for me, is ridiculous. Seriously whats the fuss about??? The main characters start showing major flaws as soon as episode 3. Plot holes which make no sense. Silly actually! They made a disaster in season 4. My review was 10 before but after watching season 4 I changed it. Just awful and un logic action. "La casa de papel" is an interesting case: a series that's written to be gripping and exciting yet at the same time doing it in all the wrong ways. It presents itself as the story of "the perfect heist" - a robbery so meticulously planned that the only way it could fall apart is if the people executing it botch their jobs really badly.<br/><br/>Guess what happens? Six out of the nine people involved botch their jobs badly, including the mastermind.<br/><br/>Fortunately, everything works out to the result of maximum suspense. Unfortunately, that happens at the cost of throwing away logic in more than one place. Not that you'd really mind if it were done ironically, or at least with a little self-awareness of the increasingly over-the-top developments. But the series insists on its own seriousness again and again, even when it has clearly gone beyond logic and went into A-Team ridiculousness.<br/><br/>What holds this series together is a group of talented actors, if you do not count Tokyo, who seems to know only one facial expression, very much like a female Nicholas Cage, except when she's having a breakdown. All the others sell their scenes convincingly Hard to see such a top rated series being so mediocre in its content.
There seems to be no logic in the sequence of events. The chief inspector does a nice 9-6 Job, not bothered about the hostages. Goes home nicely when she feels tired , dates her so called boyfriend.
I really like the part played by hostages. They enjoy themselves being in captivity. No one bothered to break free. Thought they make some attempts , but ultimately enjoy themselves being called hostages.
Also the robbers have their nice Team meeting every now and then , without being bothered about the hostages that they may run or hurt any of them. Liked the trust factor that was built betweent the two parties.
And lastly they buillt a nice tunnel between the Royal Mint and the professors house. The distance seemed to be less than 5 meters.
EXCELLENT JOB REVIEWING AUDIENCE!!! These guys call themselves revolutionaries, but all they did is to rob banks and live a luxurious life with the money they stole from state, Real REVOLUTIONARIES are people who put their life at risk for the opposed and poor, these guys are not revolutionaries, they are just murderers and bank robbers. And this show is just over glorification of crime and bank robbers Maybe for viewers that just started watching films and TV Shows. The show starts with done to death bank heist and makes most ridiculous heist ever.<br/><br/>Inside Man, although full of plot holes, was decent enough movie. This makes Inside Man Oscar material.<br/><br/>There are bunch horrendous turn of events no sane person will believe and then the story which is beyond ridiculous and makes you question hoe come one believe this at all.<br/><br/>This is perfect example how a no logic full garbage show can be made. Most overrated show i ever see!!<br/><br/>stupid acting, nonsense events I usually pick-up any TV series with thorough analysis after reading 20-30 reviews. But this one I picked randomly just because I liked the sound "Bella ciao Bella ciao" (you'll know what it is once you finish the show).<br/><br/>I bing watched it for almost a day because this damn thing is so fast paced & keeps you awake as if you're on a rollercoaster ride. The plot twists/ the anticipation/ direction/ oh boy 9/10.<br/><br/>Professor gave justice to his role. What a legend. You'll get addicted to the show and you'll start admiring some characters while hating the others. Seriously I got so much involved in the show that I started cursing some of the characters. Who thought a TV series on a money heist will be so interesting. Kudos to the creators.<br/><br/>Bella ciao Bella ciao Bella ciao ciao ciao I'm currently hate watching season 4 of the series.
If love geometry ( literally..triangles,squares) intrigues you..this might be the show for you..in case it's a thriller you want..all the okay scenes are already in the teasers and promos..so waste your time no further.<br/><br/>This show doesn't have potholes..rather the plotholes have coalesced to create some semblance of a story.<br/><br/>However here a few glaring plotholes from season 4:<br/><br/>1. 5 years..the governor and chief of security
of the Bank of Spain and even the secretary remain the same..all have fixed terms.<br/><br/>2. Nairobi had braided hair when she was shot at the end of season 3..post her surgery ( by Drx. Tokyo of course) she now has straight hair and even some lipstick and the first thing she does after a near assassination..of course..romance with Bogota.<br/><br/>3.Gandia's blood falls for the first time in the library..when he was clearly leaking in the surgery room itself.<br/><br/>4. Even despite Arturito's repeated antics..no one can just tie him to a chair and gag him..he's left unsupervised like always.<br/><br/>5. Stockholm shot at cops in the first robbery..now she has issues with Denver's aggression when he is punching a guy she clearly knows is trying to manipulate Denver.<br/><br/>This is just for this part and episode..you can imagine how the rest of the show is like.<br/><br/>P.S : Showmakers..stop spoon feeding us and please cut the annoying narration of the show's worst character..Tokyo. This has been a real treat! An amazing series, great acting, direction and such a suspenseful story it's really one of the very best I've seen ever. I love heist movies and I just found this one in Netflix and I literally couldn't stop watching through the night. The characters are simply amazing! Don't miss this! Seasons 1 & 2 are not as bad as seasons 3 & 4. It's like a bunch of college kids decided to pull off a heist with their professor who apparently, is so intimidating with his flawless plan, that the police just give into all his demands. None of the criminals look convincing at all. Everyone in the show is just falling in love. There are some twists and turns in seasons 1 & 2 that don't make the show unbearable to watch but seasons 3 & 4 is a joke. Overall, it would make for a good soap opera but definitely not a good crime drama. I found this Spanish TV series by chance, I really recommend you watch it.
It's one of the best series that I have seen lately.
A chess game between the police and the robbers, you will be surprised by its development.
You can not foresee anything.
(I hope that my review is correct, I'm not a native speaker) Fast paced. Action. Great acting. Ingenious plot. This show is perfect. 10/10 for me More repetitive than garlic!
Rio was tortured for the first episodes, if you watch seasons 3 & 4, you'll be too...
Honestly I've only watched until the end just for curiosity, spare yourself and choose anything else to kill the time during the quarantine. Really disappointed in this fourth part of money heist. From Gandi being immune to bullets to just killing Nairobi in front of them. How did that even happened? I think Nairobi had some much more to her character and it was painful to see her fall.<br/><br/>But worst part was the script for professor, what happened to all his big smart plans? He just lost all his brain capacity just like that. Only good plan he had this season was the "Pris plan" but I wasn't satisfied with that. Why take her in their and what is there plan.<br/><br/>
This whole season contained almost nothing about the actual heist, just about freeing Lisabon and a man that immune to bullets.<br/><br/>I think they did a season that was almost unnecessary, with only fillers in all the characters script. Was it just me that didn't feel like I was watching "Money heist"?<br/><br/>Worst part was how they left us with a cliffhanger and how did she even get there with just a license plate. The real professor would never let a mistake like that happend.<br/><br/>Overall not worth about 1 year of hype for it. This series got a high rating. So I thought let's check it out. My god how the hell people are even liking it! It is so overrated. Here are few points I picked up from first 7 episodes.
1) Professor makes the stealing looks like a heroic act. I mean how. They are not stealing but printing money, so what is that, charity!!!
2) The guys involved in the heist are so stupid. Two of them fell in love & now their love is more important than their mission. One father who spent most of his life in prison got panick attack knowing his son has murdered a hostage and almost compromised their mission. The son who is a 'hotshot' and used to 'bully people' fell in love with a hostage and could not kill her. (Yeah that's how the poor their writting is). It's nothing wrong for a criminal to have a heart but they have it too much, you will feel they are too good to be a criminal (but none of them are amateurs).
3) The police. They are the stupidest people I know. An inspector shares her mission information with her mother. She goes home & comes back like you are in a 9-5 job. She even dates during the mission. They let any people enter in their camp, no privacy at all. Even I could have fooled them.
Don't even talk about the acting and voice-overs. Apart from one or two people the acting is aweful. Please stay away from this show. (I only could watch the first season, everything written is only applies for that)<br/><br/>Money Heist could be a good piece, if the make it a movie series, or a short series.<br/><br/>The base story is good, but it doesn't have enough content to fill up a whole series so they decided to go the path where they write stupid twists and conflicts to make up the screen time. If I have to describe it: seriously painful to watch level of stupidity.
Some characters are out of place, annoying kids who doesn't contribute anything to the heists succes, no way any masterplan would involve them. Any storng-enough individual could learn using powertools in five months, why would bring an older man just for that?
The small thing that bothers me most is the CSi syndrome, where they want to show their technology as fantastic, way too advanced. They do impossible things most of the time. This applies to logic too, the police every time assumes everything right from the smallest information drop. "Blurry image? Enhance. There is a face. We know everything about them now." and so on.<br/><br/>TLDR: Bad writing, bad directing, bad characters and (maybe) bad acting.<br/><br/>Why it got the 3 stars:
The picture is very good. The camerawork, the lighting, the props, the clothing, the locations/sets (except the abandoned road felt out of place in the heists beginning) and the sound is flawless.<br/><br/>Way to watch: The english dub ridiculous, set the language to original and the subtitles to english (cc).<br/><br/>Based on the other reviews, which say that the first two seasons was the better, I DO NOT RECOMMEND watching Money Heist to anyone like me, who demands logic in a story. Do yourself a favour and save those hours for something worthy. The plot has very primitive line. First robbers have some advantage, after that police makes move and this cycle continues on and on. Moreover, all characters are invincible, they can get hurt but still continue to live.
Please, don't waste your time on this. It started with a interesting premise. Printing one's own money, rather than stealing from people. The practical ramifications of printing that much money as shown(2 billion I think, I don't care) must be equally complex. But no one talks about that. Which would have made it a much more interesting show. Instead, we are introduced to some Morons who actually would be better off as Circus partners rather than robbers. Add to that , probably the Stupidest Chief Inspector in the Whole World with an equally stupid police force at her disposal and you get a La Casa De Papel.<br/><br/>People, We are in Grave danger, that being popularity is taken as a substitute for quality and creativity. This is happening at a unfathomable rate is all creative walks of life. The Avengers movies are a classic example for the case. Female inspectors is dumb . Robber keep coming front of her she don't use her brain. . Don't waste your time with this series I'm in season 1 episode 3 I'm already bored. Congratulations to the actors, director, writer and anyone who made this season of episodes possible. Every episode had it's gripping and human slow moments, such a wonderful balance. Couldn't wait to see the next episode. Each one had surprises, no standard script, which is so enjoyable. 
The actors played so well, better than many of the better known Hollywood names.
Hope the next season is coming up soon. Sure, the idea of the show is smart and entertaining: a bunch of elite criminals working together to rob billions of dollars. Some of the characters such as Berlin are professional and smart, which is good for the plot. It could have been a great series. But the show went downhill after Tokyo's relation with Rio is introduced. Their love is not reasonable at all and Tokyo kept using love as an excuse to ruin the plan of the entire team, putting everyone in danger but did not pay for her mistakes. Besides, there are just so many plot holes in the show that I don't want to spoil here. The police are totally dumb and useless that they deal with the criminals in such stupid and inefficient methods. Many of the characters in the show does not help develop the plot but just annoy the audience so much, one of them being Tokyo who is so immature and arrogant which kept bringing trouble to the whole team. The actions of the characters are simply not understandable and the show simply doesn't deserve such a positive rating. I would have given it a better rating if not for the annoying characters and plot. Such thrilling topic simply doesn't mix well with undeveloped and sudden emotions and love between the characters. Started with a nice idea, reminding me a lot of inside man, then it went downhill. Lots of plot holes and things that don't make sense. It was a nice change to watch a Spanish series though. It can be a lot more enjoyable if you don't think of what you are seeing I guess, but I couldn't. The plot holes, the most stupid police in the universe and some very annoying meaningless characters, like seriously what on earth did Tokyo bring on the table as a thief, no expertise on anything, just there to poke her nose into everything like a hot headed arrogant she was.<br/><br/>Sorry but this is definitely not a 10. It could easily be, it had all the potential, many things it did right, but if you are lacking in the scenario it cannot be hidden behind some very nice character progression, performance and general atmosphere. And don't get me started about the ending, common. It is a great non-hollywood european series. It is well paced, well directed, actors are selling their characters well mostly. It is a pleasant romantic fiction adventure, with a superficial revolutionary message which will make you probably have a good time if not biased. It is generally well done in most aspects, esp. If you consider that it is spanish. It's not a 10/10 and certainly not 1/10. What I mostly read here is bipolar reviewers based on their personal feelings which have to do with their expectations due to hype,or other things that have nothing to do with reviewing the show. First of all, watching this series is only good if you need some adrenaline but even in that case, you need to keep skipping lots of lame scenes.
Secondly, whoever made this tv show, must've watched too much hollywood and hollywood and also thinks he/she knows about psychology. But it is full of unnecessary events, stupidity and unrealistic scenes. Just for example; who in his right mind would even imagine that a boy who has been tortured for 2 months can handlenother heist? another one, Tokyo's character s unrealistically stupid because of impulsiveness, anger, insurgency and lack of any interporsonal skills. What kind of professor would hire a person who has thoughtlessly decided to visit her mom right after making a scene in that robbery which ended up getting her boyfriend killed?
or that rio... what a joke his caracter was! nothing wrong with him if he wasnt picked up for a robby so big by a "brilliant mind", The Professor, who played around with all Spain. I gave up counting how many times they pointed guns at each other, how many times they were out of lines and stopped taking orders. I give 6/10 only because it pumped some adrenaline. The first 2 seasons were fantastic, I can give 8 out of 10
you can even watch the 3rd , I can give 7 out of 10
But the 4th season is not gripping , not a good plot and dragged a lot . So I'm giving 4 out if 10.
They should end this series in season 5. Don't waste your time with this show. I believe that someone from this show got on here and gave them a ton of high-level reviews. The show is so terrible that it does not make any sense that anyone would say it was good... It's a very weak story line and the voiceover choice of actors is awful. The acting is really bad, and I would guess you will never see any of these Spanish actors in anything UK or US based. You should do yourself a favor and watch "The Girl with a Dragon Tattoo" then watch an episode of this garbage and you will have gone from gold to trash.<br/><br/>A friend told me about this series... After about 3 episodes it was obvious that the writing was bad. It got worse and worse after each episode and felt like it was written for bored middle school kids with no imagination. The holes in the story are awful and the acting is bad. Every episode felt more like a daytime soap opera. The storyline got worse and worse with ridiculous outcomes. I read one of the reviews on IMDB and I laughed out loud with some of the stupid things the police could have done to end this boring kidnapping quickly! For example, "Turn off the lights in the building" - LOL<br/><br/>The main female actor and her role are ludicrous, and the script given to the mother is unbelievably bad. What is also bad is the music which reminds me of those terrible daytime soap operas. Can you imagine you walking into your house with some random guy you just met, and your mother asks you if you made love last night? Really! Well that si straight from the show - ugh. Terrible! Money Heist is a stupidly organized heist in which amateur thiefs deal with dumb police with so much of melodrama blended with nonsense events! It's nothing but a bigger version of daily soap TV serials! I don't get it why it is that much high rated but this is a pure waste of your intellectual & time! The whole plot is not conclusive in itself. Seriously painful to watch for people who need atleast a little logical connections. Terrible acting. Unrealistic and underdeveloped characters. Even more unrealistic conversations between characters. The Plot, although had a great potential, was immature with illogical links and ridiculous outcomes. And out of all the characters one could criticize in this tv series lets discuss Tokyo, oh my goodness, a neurotic, mentally unstable, unrealistic character and even worse execution by the actress. Repulsive! Yea what a waste of time. The professor has time to go on dates during a robbery? Sad series. This is comedy, romantic and trash.
Only season one is good! This series should be ended in seasson 2.. please stop Could not stop watching this series. What an excellent set of actors fully into their roles in a natural way. Refreshing storyline unlike most other movies or series about bank robberies. Can't wait for season two It started with a great idea but was getting worst and worst. The characters are bad written and shallow. Part 4 is like part 2, you expect everything. No new ideas, exactly the same mistakes. Too many flashbacks in order to cover the plot holes. Till part 3 at least it's watchable. Part 4 is really bad and.... it will be continued...! Nowhere near a 9. This show is a great example of when the netflix hype-train runs off the tracks and I will tell you why.<br/><br/>
The two main female characters are supposed to be tough and assertive but both become stereotypical "I have feelings too" characters you so often see in generic tv/movies. In the case of the police officer, we are talking about a career defining case that will take at most a couple weeks. We're talking about a 24/7 hostage situation which she is solely responsible for. Meanwhile you have a very young child at home who has said she doesn't want to live with you anymore. This is infuriatingly unrealistic. Let's just say for the sake of argument that the character is 42, and that she won't be having any more kids. She is a single parent, her mom who lives with her has Alzheimer's and both her mom and daughter's safety are basically in jeopardy by leaving them unsupervised. Now add in the 24/7 hostage crisis, working (for argument sake) around 18 hours a day. Instead of going home and checking on both of the only loved ones in her life, she frequently goes to get coffee instead of going home. So far, ok, people do shit like this, I can understand. The thing that really crossed the line is that she not only neglects her home life, but willingly divulges unnecessary information to a complete stranger. Again, we are talking about maybe a few weeks of what is really going to either define your career, or ruin it. The few weeks that will decide if your daughter will ever see you again. This entire course of events just seemed forced and unrealistic. She practised no discretion whatsoever (how did she get to the position that she is in in such a field?), her judgment is along the lines of a drunk college girl - spending more time thinking about getting laid then being an adult.<br/><br/>The other main female character (the robber), portrays this stone cold vicious attitude, and while other characters also exhibit that, she seems to be ruthless. Guess again. The one person she loved was killed in front of her but that didn't seem to phase her. Her mother even turns her in, still nothing. So she gets involved in this seemingly too good to be true heist and all you have to do is be professional, and don't form inappropriate and personal relationships with your co-workers (which applies to literally any job). Again, ok we are all human she lost a loved one, had her mom flip on her etc. I could understand something like this if she fell in love, but nope. She certainly doesn't love the guy, and I can't imagine how she ever would. He is naive, and practices poor judgment, doesn't have the heart to do what needs to be done, is basically a liability. It just doesn't fit her character to A. act so unprofessionally, and B. risk everything for someone she isn't serious about. Same rules apply to the robber as the cop, we are talking a 24/7 heist, a couple weeks at most, a life-time of either glory, or ruin. And yet again we get the "I have feelings too" story-arch superseding an unfathomable amount of money. It just doesn't fit the character to jeopardize that, be a professional thief/robber, and exhibit this kind of behavior during such a critical small amount of time.<br/><br/>As you can see this is beginning to become a pattern, and we see it again with the professor to a lesser extent. Basically (aside from the tough exterior) he jeopardizes years of work to get laid. I won't go into detail on the professor, but he really isn't that smart, but neither are the police, so I guess that's okay. I am not sure how the police do things in Spain, but the level of fuck-ups just seems uncharacteristic. We're talking about rogue officers jeopardizing dozes of lives, lack of discretion, poor police-tactics specifically during the raid(s), poor judgment (how the fuck can you not sweep for bugs when the government is sitting in and you obviously have a mole), and on top of that just overall incompetence from everything to PR to gross mishandling of evidence handling. The other detective drinking and driving to such an extent because he is emotional. It is all just so unbelievable, again though I am not Spanish so maybe that is the level of competence that their police show.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
As you can see, this is just the characters alone I have I outlined, and why I feel this show doesn't deserve to be rated as high as shows like Westworld, Mad Men, House of Cards, etc. It is actually rated higher than a few of those and just absolutely does not even belong in the same league.<br/><br/>The list goes on and I could make the case for other elements, other characters, etc. However, I will say that there are a lot of great things about this show. The plot is great, the 'idea' behind certain aspects of things like characters, methodology, behaviors, even things small things like the masks and fake gun rotation are excellent. The positives do outweigh the negatives, but not to the degree that warrants a near-perfect score.<br/><br/>The point of this review was not to bash the show, but to provide a more unbiased opinion (imo) because I experienced it in it's infancy with no real information available (I actually had trouble finding it on imdb). Also, because I feel that someone needs to speak up as the show has obviously been put on a pedestal because Netflix put their name on it.<br/><br/>I do recommend this show because on the surface it is something different, and has a lot of unique qualities. It is entertaining, but nowhere near perfect.<br/><br/>7/10 at most. The plot gives us so many promises that it can not keep. Still better than average. However, cliché characters make it hard to watch wirhout feeling ashamed for the script writer. Some characters are well-built, but mostly stereotypical. It is supposed to be a smart robbery with smart thieves however i cant stop wondering why the proffesor picked those people specifically. Tokyo, for example, what is she really good for except supposed-to-be-sexy cliché monologues to intimidate certain someone or just wandering around, turning people on, making it all harder for the others.
There are many flaws as such.
But still watching it for the fun of it since it is hard to find clever scripts anymore.
The show is thrilling enough to let myself be fooled on certain details. After season 1 I won't be watching any more. I felt that it had the weakest storylines intertwined with poor story telling, patronising product placement (mainly of Spanish beer), and mundane sets & outfits. Not to mention the endless pointless non-functioning character development make this a huge miss for me - it was just uncomfortable to watch, but if you like Spanish soap operas it might be for you. Great idea, but why did they stretch it out so long. After season 2 I'm out. Some good acting and some awful. Every time Arturo was on screen I hoped he'd get killed off, awful. The interwoven plot is clever but ridiculous. Shame it could've been great. I suspect a lot of the good reviews are from Spanish speaking people. The dubbing is laughable, terrible voice acting. Even without that the story starts off pretty good then slowly gets worse, with silly plot lines that don't make sense. Disappointed I've noticed a LOT, A LOT of the fake positive reviews mention breaking bad, that should tell you one thing. The plot sucks, you plan for months and you get this kiddy crap going on? Maybe I don't understand how stuff works in Europe, but a good show should make it seem somewhat real. There is nothing that feels real about the show. Gonna be in the building for days and yet they "want" a loose cannon on the team???? Not sure about the acting as I was listening in dubbed English, so can't say much about that. But the plot holes....... A well written show???? What???? Take a totally inept police force, and lucky as hell robbers, and you have this show. I never will understand why in every singel scene they give like all of their "characteristics", it's just too much. If I'd like to watch Escrava Isaura - I would.
Sorry, but the plot is so sh***y, I really don't get the hype around this series.
What irritates me the most: the creators try to show in a serious maner a story for elementary school children.
Never again I am very dissapointed of season 4. Nothing happened though all of the Episode except that Raquel Was release in a very unrealsitic way. They found an Helikopter Just like that and got away with it. And the pilot of the helikopet knows 50 foreign languages and how to drive an Helikopter. :D
Another rediculous fact is that the pregnant detective is such a Genius that she could find Just in 5 five the Professor.
Sorry, I prefer to watch Spiderman. It's more realistic and interesting. This is one of the most overrated show i have ever seen, the downhill is so hard that it hurt me psychologically.
The romance is bad and stupid with no sense plot. 
The characters in the beginning seem to be very pro and you can find later that they are a bunch of amateurs, they will make you hate the characters instead of develop them, the insteresting ones...well... you will see
the show calls you for the plottwist and the drama but there is like only 2/3 things that happens that you will think "damn nice..." the rest is only them arguing and pointing themselves with the guns lol. the ending is cliche and the story plot has many fails.
its sad because it had potencial but they just downhill the show. Characters are so unbelievably dumb. Just don't watch it. The creator of the series had the right idea and a lot is done right.<br/><br/>Writing, however, is what absolutely ruins the show. My problem with it is that every character in the show is an absolutely obnoxious idiot who couldn't mug someone in a wheelchair let alone pull off the "biggest heist in history".<br/><br/>Characters feel like they we're written by a six year old's kid definition of a 'bad man'. These people are portrayed as the top criminals in their line and fail to convince you so every chance they get. The professional thief doesn't know what fingerprints are, the hacking prodigy leaves a hostage alone with her phone to discuss relationship with his girlfriend, the impulsive fightstarter backs down from anyone who speaks to him in a tone (including hostages). Half of the events wouldn't happen if the characters were not morons.<br/><br/>Everyone is overly melodramatic and get butthurt over minor things instead of focusing on what they need to do. As the title says, it's a melodrama not a heist. The show tries so hard convincing you there's tension but there isn't any. Not a single action has any consequence, the characters are not presented with difficult choices. The only thing that seems to be in risk are the fragile feelings of the main characters.<br/><br/>If you're familiar with the concept of show don't tell, money heist is the opposite. All tell and no show. Hard to believe that this has such a high rating. I watched the first season and hoped it would get somewhat better in the 2nd but it somehow got way worse.<br/><br/>Don't waste your time. The series started with a good story and should have been ended since season 2 thats it, season 4 is the worse, a season with no meaning and no story and just a waste of time. A motley gang of criminals spend five months under the supervision of the hyper-annoying Professor, to learn how to pull off the heist of the millennium. If the premise sounds stupid, it's because it is. The Professor must possess infinite time and resources to select his gang, prepare the plan, organise the "lessons", rent a house in a secluded location, feed himself and the gang for months, etc...<br/><br/>But even if you buy it - for entertainment sake - all the "careful preparation" turns out as a mighty waste of time, because boys and girls on both sides of the law are too busy with their hormonal tempests.<br/><br/>All the four main female characters are engaged in illicit affairs and/or showing off plenty of flesh and lots of time is spent gazing at their buttocks. Discussing and carrying out intricate sexual cavortings soon derails the plot. Pregnancies are debated endlessly.<br/><br/>Within 24 hours from creating a hostage situation involving over 60 people, the criminals are privy to the affair of a married guy with his secretary and talk endlessly about that, like gossiping schoolgirls.<br/><br/>The stupidity of the dialogues is impressive.... Raquel, the lady detective in charge of negotiations, after having created a minor mess with the hostages, phones HER MUM, because she is terribly distressed, but they end up talking about a stranger Raquel is infatuated with.<br/><br/>I am not sure if the Raquel's role was a homage to female strength, but she actually succeed in being a massive stereotype of female irrationality and weakness. Could you imagine a male counterpart talking to mum about how hard his job is?<br/><br/>Finally, the whole plot is TOTALLY derivative: Tokyo is a bad copy of Mia, from Pulp Fiction; the criminals choosing fake names is copied from "Reservoir Dogs"; the hostages being forced to wear overalls, from "Inside man"... etc..<br/><br/>PS from the enthusiastic reviews of the audience, one would think the vast majority never watched a heist movie/series before... First of all, they are bad guys. So if i get to see all the robbers in the prison I'll be happy. Second of all, the show doesn't seem to understand that they're bad guys and robbers!!!
Season 4 was such bull. For an average IQ this season was subpar in terms of everything. The subplots didn't work, the professor was someone else entirely and there was somuch drama it felt like a reality tv show where all contestants are locked in one house.
Also, why do none of the hostages do anything??
And why did they have to make Arturo such a bad guy?
Makes no sense How the hell did this series get a rating of more than 8? Illogical story with so many plot holes and stupid characters to go along with. None of the characters are likable. One of the dumbest series ever. Stopped watching after 6 episodes as my head was exploding with all the nonsense being told. I heard so much good about this series. Finally after years of recommendations from different people I decided to give it a try. And boy, what a mistake it was.Let me just say, that I created account here - only to write this review. I am that angry.<br/><br/>Let me start with the good things. First season started quite well as the basic premise is very good and intriguing - execute perfect plan and "steal" huge sum of money - but how they are going to do that? Character of the Professor was good as well. That is it. No really, that is is.<br/><br/>Let's go into the negatives. Almost every character besides Professor is annoying as hell. And it has nothing to do about them being ambiguous. They are just totally unlikable despite clear tries from the series creators. And I guess Tokio takes the prize in that department. Each time I saw her I wanted to skip this part of episode (which I did very often in Season 2), unfortunately she is our narrator... Serbs, Moscow and Berlin were not terrible as characters. The rest is just a joke.<br/><br/>After first season I contemplated whether I should continue. I decided to finish story and went into season 2. Who the hell wrote it? Again characters continue their completely stupid behavior - they go from one extreme to another in a span of one episode... , incredible situations happen, stupidity of decisions. Of course I did not expect this series to be accurate and true to life, but there are limits. In season 2 I was skipping entire sections out of boredom, anger and disbelieve - I just wanted it to see how it ends, and forget about it.<br/><br/>I will not watch season 3, 4 and 5. Enough of this torture.<br/><br/>This is just a poorly executed SOAP opera disguised as heist series, with terrible characters, totally unbelievable situations. What a waste of time. I still wonder how this is so highly rated. Although the tv show had everything needed to succeed, the greediness of the producers and netflix make the series a really ''one of many'' out there.
Season 1 started surprisingly good and had everything needed for success: amazing plot, new actors, a different language, diversity, everything! And that's the reason it was amazingly succesful.
Season 2 was good enough, not as the first one but nice to watch.
Season 3 was the first sign that somebody tries to make money out of the dead horse. Plotholes, bad acting, people keep repeating phrases, irrelevant scenes...You could easily understand that something is going wrong.
As for season 4...? I think it was the final shot for the tv show. Even more irrelevant scenes, huge plotholes, people reacting and doing things with no reason...<br/><br/>This is for everyone bothered to see this review. Start respecting your audience, don't treat them as money...Find out what your limits are!<br/><br/>4 stars, because you had an amazingly good 1st and 2nd season... Total waste of your time season 3 n 4 never watch them...zero for these two seasons Boring, fairy tale film, nothing to do with reality, ridiculous. It starts with a good plot, but in season 1 and 2, the pace is so slow, it really feels like the writer is stretching the story too much with drama.
This series could be the best action series of all time, but they choose to bend it to a mini telenovela with overstretched drama.<br/><br/>I have to fair, there are great moments, cool actions, chilling plot, but there are also useless conversations, stupid logic and maybe one of the worst: very very unrealistic shooting choreography. Example how can Gandia escape from 6 shooters with assault rifles from a short range?
What happen when the first show down when Palermo hurt his eyes, and nobody else gets a single wound?
You guys should really hire a better choreographer, no need a John Woo level, but a least not this STUPID.<br/><br/>The figure Arturo is so cheap, maybe intriguing at first season. But the writer keeps him in season 3 and 4 just to make the audience has someone to hate.
In season 3 and 4, the pace is so much better than the season 1 and 2. But additional to Arturo, here comes Sierra. An unrealistic figure who was created just to made the audience boils.<br/><br/>For acting, i have to give Berlin a extra credit for an outstanding performance.
Else from him, i have to say: mostly poor performance. Even the Professor.
Even Tokyo. Season 1 and 2 rate - 8, Season 3 and 4 rate 1. Especially season 4.nothing really happened. 80% of time they talk about past and 20% is actually action and story goes on in that time. Too bas for the series. It was promising The story is tiringly repetitive
Creativity was lost in the last 2 seasons because the story was complete but then netflix decided to order more
Just let it be over
It became junk-food television They try to make the story so great that its just absurd now. I had to stop at season 4 ep 5 to write this.. That gun fight scene... WOW. Its like a seven year old wrote the scene. Was he on a bullet bending drug to escape that???
People give this too much credit probably for the intensity a heist creates, eventhough the movie has pointless twists all over. Unintelligent Illogical Boring Cringefest clownfiesta of a series. I don't know whats going on. I feel scammed by these ratings. It almost feels like somebody pushes the hype around the series just to get some good votes. To me this series was a complete waste of time. Too many plotholes, too poor of an excecution. Generell idea is good, but thats it. How much do you get paid to give this a high rating because I could use a few extra bucks? 10 minutes in I knew this was garbage. A thief has her face plastered all over the news and she decides it was a good time to go visit her mother??? This was obviously written for someone who has never saw a show about crime or better yet a show at all. I refuse to list everything that's wrong with this show because that would basically be everything but I have to comment on a few laughable moments. I mean come on, the inspector has time to go on dates in the middle of a heist, pregnant hostages are willing to have sex and fall in love with robbers they knew for all but 30 seconds and lets not forget the professor aka the psychic. Even if he was planning this heist for 5 years he could not have thought of every possible conrtingency. Some say to leave your brains at the door when you watch this, I say dont even open the door you'll never get those hours of your life back. This is probably the worst series I ever watched on Netflix. How is this so highly rated and popular is beyond my grasp. There is no logic, and the acting my most of the actors is terrible (esp Tokyo..couldn't even watch her scenes without skipping) And the lead inspector is the worst written character ever. Such a joke! Either most critics lack basic brain functions, or most critics were paid. I can not imagine any serious intelligent adult who would actually finish watching this series, look back, and then rate it anything above above 2/10. I mean... seriously!
If you are still watching it, thinking it will get better, more logical, pieces will come together: it won't and they won't. Nonsensical until the very end. Do yourself a favour, and watch anything else instead.<br/><br/>Only one example: how could Raquel let the Professor escape TWICE while holding him at gunpoint? She never considers calling her colleagues? Do the right and logical thing: solving the kidnap? Or do the writers suggest she fails to take him in, because she subconsciously loves him under her raging anger, and therefore fails more or less intentionally??? Please, do not insult any viewers with more than two brain cells...<br/><br/>Netflix, I am dissappointed: with the series and with the rating system. Pffff.... This must be one of the best series I've seen lately.
It is so thrilling and unpredictable in every single episode, that you have no idea how it will end. I'm surprised to see this show is one of the highly rated. Here's my honest review.
The idea of the story is good
Cons:
<ul><li>Overdramatic: Every episode is 70 to 80% unnecessary time wasting scenes. Director fit forced drama in every scene</li><li>Wrost Actors: They casted pre-mature actors who you can clearly see that they are not skilled actors</li><li>Laugh of a guy called Denver will be the top annoying</li><li>English voice over of the professor is so weird</li><li>In 2nd season, inspector will uncover who is the professor, she arrests him but instead of telling anyone in Police or taking him to the station, she takes him to personal spot and make love and do a lie detection test even though he already accepted that he's the one who planned the heist, WTF is this drama man.</li></ul><br/><br/>Conclusion: Avoid brain farts, watch something else. Seasons 1 & 2 were great and well worth a watch. I would easily give them a 9/10, they were so fast paced and full of tension, but most of all they were original and fun.<br/><br/>Since then, someone at Netflix has unfortunately cashed in and completely destroyed this show. Honestly, it's like watching a completely different programme. It's become a non-sensical, soap opera and how some of the characters are still allowed to make decisions is beyond me. I've written this review after season 3 and will not be watching season 4, I've got a feeling it's for the best!<br/><br/>I would absolutely recommend that you watch the first two seasons and forgot that they ever made anymore, it will not affect your enjoyment of the first two. Ruined by its own success, what a shame. The premise had lots of potential. A well planned, carefully thought out heist the likes of which Spain (and possibly any other country) has ever seen.<br/><br/>Unfortunately it all starts to fall apart when they carry out the plan. Highly unprofessional criminals, stupid hostages, and an amount of drama that would rival any South American TeleNovela. My Spanish husband was keen for me to watch this but after the first episode I was convinced that this was a show that would be full of cliché after cliché.
I would like to ask the writers whether you intend for the audience to take this show seriously or is it a bad take on the 17th century picaresque narrative? Have you ever heard of showing not telling? I suppose in order to compensate for the general lack of talented actors you have to resort to force feeding us their motives and reactions. In the 21st century audiences have come to expect characters who are various shades of grey, not black and white cartoons of good guys and bad guys. I know the police in Spain are not that incompetent so who are you writing for? Is it some type of social commentary? The women in Spain are also not overly emotional who crumble under pressure (To the point where they call their mother from the back of an ambulance). What is the point of a character like Alison (Eye candy)? And don't get me started on Monica (she has some type of personality disorder). Both are cringe worthy. Rio rats out his fellow thieves because things don't go his way and there are no consequences. Tokyo ruins everything and yet she is welcome back with open arms which is ridiculous story telling. This show is written like a bad fan fiction full of Mary Sues.
Don't stick a Dali mask on the show and expect us to believe it is art. Plot is so stupid and unlikely, wasted a couple of hours I will never get back...... The plot was good,Rest are a huge mess. If you are expecting to see some thriller,action,crime mystery don't waste your time in this mess, unless you want to watch an unbelievable fantasy. A person with Logic & common sense should find it pretty difficult to watch this series. Seemed like God himself planned the heist for them, no matter what the situation always favours the robbers. And the chief of Police is definitely the worst character ever in my opinion. Have seen some spanish movies, its definitely the worst spanish creation i've ever watched. It was pretty hard to continue after the 1st 2 or 3 episodes of season 1, But still watched till season 2. I must say i regret watching this. A thief is a thief. This show portraits thieves as heroes. May convey wrong messege to people. I think the series started well but eventually it became a mess of love dramas and too many plot holes including invencible robbers and dumb police. In the beginning it's so refreshing but from episode to episode it's just the same. Professor knows everything, no matter what's going to happen. Main characters rarely die and if they do it's a heroic death. Always the same methods to make police officers do what they want. Relationships between the characters are rarely catching and to me it's just bad acting since season 3.
The motive for the second heist is just a joke. They should have ended it after two seasons. Now it's pure greed, nothing more. By far the most overrated series I've watched. Waste of time I thought. Some episodes are decent and series gets better by season 3 but people calling this the best series? far from it. People should stop comparing this to breaking bad and other series, it's a corny series.. and robbers falling in love with hostages? really?.. It's a 5 from me. How many hours of TV can you spend focused on a single robbery? Half way through the first season, it ran out of steam and got awfully soap opera like. I made it through 13 episodes of season one thinking the heist would be resolved, but was totally frustrated that I have to get through season two (at least) before the original crime is even done. Seems like somebody said 'how can we drag a crime or for the longest possible duration - then double it and add a few extra hours of cheesy unrealistic love triangles for good measure.<br/><br/>Maybe seasons 2 and 3 turn three series around, but I'm not going to invest the time to find out... First of all, we should stop celebrating a crime.
The professor & his team is nothing but a group of criminals. By loving the series, we are encouraging crime. If not, then tomorrow they will make series on terrorists and show them as warriors of Resistance.<br/><br/>About series, I think Tokyo is a pathetic character who is so selfish that while other gang members risk their lives for her, she always mess up the operation. She tries to look powerful but she is not. She is unstable and week.
The makers should remove her from series.<br/><br/>I would love to see all them getting caught or killed in Season 5 and Police should win, because we love our country and our police. Not the criminals.<br/><br/>Right fellas? I used to love this series, but now i'm annoyed.
Season 1 was great and kinda logical, season 2 was OK then it went really bad and illogical.
Spent 8 hours watching season 4 and ended with BIG DISAPPOINTMENT and was total waste of time just to see how it's gonna end.
Not gonna watch season 5 and will certainly delete the whole series from my top list.👎🏻 I tried several times now. I didn't even read any reviews before so my opinion is souly my own. What the hell happened to this series? It's SO bad and over dramatic. It used to be a smart show and now it's like they hired indian soap-opera writers for the season 4 script. I loved this series but I can't get through this season. 3 episodes in and I'm just gonna stop watching now. It was a fun ride while it lasted.<br/><br/>PS. Whoever made the music for this season should never get a job again. The music is SO overdramatic most of the time. Playing heroic soundtracks while people are just talking. Like do they not have any sense of music and ambience when it comes to film? Jesus christ dude... Overrated.. don't just go with ratings. Bunch of thieves can't keep it together to get the job done!.... Big robbery? Huh.. Started excellent but after just 2/3 episodes it all goes to total mess.. it feels some events are intentionally created to longer the story to make a twist or something! Could have been better.. Absolutely unrealistic screenplay, annoying acting of Ursula Corbero as Tokio, a lot of stupid actions for so "professional" bank robbers. It sounded promising but after just a few episodes it lost it. Everything about this is very bad. Don't wast your time. I'm hate watching it just because my ocd won't let me stop. It's so hard to imagine anyone actually writing this show. It was hard to watch at all. Season 1 and 2 are good. Season 4 is really really very stupid. And waste of time. After a spectacular Season 1 & 2, season 3 was okayish but perhaps riding on success, Netflix just completely ruined up with season 4. Disappointed. In first two seasons they built an amazing thought about the series and got a large audience, people loved the cartil, but when they decided to do 3 or maybe 4 extra seasons they are destroying all that and wasting all the efforts that has been done in first seasons
They are losing the respect that they got at the beginning There is a huge mistake in the plot. Why didn't the robbers negotiate a deal with Gandia to surrender himself and let Tokyo go in exchange for the life of the Governor? They had the Governor in their possession all this while and didn't make use of him. That's plain stupidity. What about the genius mind of the professor and the criminal minds of the robbers? This hole in the plot is unpardonable and it made a mockery of the whole season. The show implies that they are very smart but they spend the time proving that they are really really really dumb. All this to create tension. It could have been so good but they managed to make it annoyn Avoid this series unless you hate yourself and have time to waste. It is a mess, there's no way around it. From the absurd premise, to the clumsy execution and the mono-dimensional, stereotypical characters, there's little to nothing in terms of true enjoyment to be had. Every episode is just a series of contrived turn of events where every main character acts in the worst, most unintelligible way possible. There's no nuance, no real interesting psychological trait, every single character is encaged in a stereotype; everyone is annoying, bland, trivial, over melodramatic. And the story is even worse. Despite its desire to be seen as smart and clever, it's just so absurd and forced that the viewer is left speechless. The police are basically dummies, they play no significant role in how things turn out and if the protagonists weren't the most detached, oblivious, nonsensical fictional beings ever, the series would end after four episodes. Save yourself from this. The show really shines in the first few episodes, but after that quickly drowns in cheesy characters, senseless arguing and overall a very spanish soap opera feel. I can't believe how can they screw it up SOOOOO BAAAAAD
it was soo good !!!! It shows how stupid the police are, and tokyo is the most annoying character. It was good at first 2-3 episodes but then it gets worst. I don't know if these positive reviews were paid for but I wouldn't be surprised. This is one of the stupidest shows I have ever seen in my entire life. I know there has to be an element of suspension of disbelief but his show requires you to but your brain in the trash bin while you watch this. Plan not using it all. The characters are so stupid and pathetic and one dimensional. It's sad to see Spain so influenced by the worst of american culture and movie making. El Tiempo Entre Costuras is a great show, much better than this crap if you want to see a good spanish series. I don't want to include spoilers because I truly want to warn as many people as possible from this horror show of stupidity. HUGE waste of time. The only thing that got me through it was knowing I was going to negatively review. The worst part about it is the ridiculous show doesn't wrap up at the end of the season. They are trying to stretch another season out of this pure garbage. Far-fetched, predictable, unrealistic, and really shabby acting.<br/><br/>The robbers are now going against each other, there's been at least 2 love stories all in the first 24 hours of a heist..<br/><br/>The fact that the robbers are now against each other and are lying to each other and going behind each others backs and trying to save the hostages is just so unrealistic and dramatic.<br/><br/>Now it's robbers vs robbers vs police vs love life drama #1 vs love life drama #2 vs hostages. Get in the bin. Season 3 and season 4 were the most unnecessary seasons in the history of TV. Everything was either repeated or badly executed. Replacing characters with - guess what- a copycat of that character.
And on top of all an ill explanation for the whole thing.<br/><br/>I had rated this show 7/10 after season 2.
Now it deserves a 1/10 only because zeroes are not allowed here. I don't understand the hype around this!<br/><br/>actors are average, story is nothing special, visual effects or anything that can make you sit back and wait for the next episode are missing.<br/><br/>this was the first TV show that doesn't make me wanna see what happens next, even after dragging myself through the entire season 1.<br/><br/>I think I only watched it so far because I really wanted to understand the hype. Seriously...this program have a score of 8,4 ?? Really ?? ....Money heist its a show for kids of 14 years old , with a stupid script ,with forced situations, with even more forced reactions and overacted characters ..... a dissapointing frankenstein made for teenangers and people with bad taste in shows. We've only watched the first 2.5 episodes of S1, but it looks like that's going to be it. The premise promises a thrilling caper type series, but it's just not that. It's more melodrama and bungling, which isn't what we signed up for or intriguing. We just don't care about any of these characters or believe they could pull off such a heist.<br/><br/>Her Take: I feel baited and switched. I hate that.<br/><br/>His Take: Too many scenes feel like they were included just because someone wanted to film them. It makes the plot disjointed, unengaging and unbelievable. Don't watch after two parts otherwise you will be regret. They ruined everything in part 3&4. If you're on adult, you'll start wondering about IMDb's excellent reviews of this very naive and complete nonsense series after episode 1. But then you notice the reviews are paid by Netflix, all phrasings very similar, no effort, all 10 points. The series would've had a lot of potential, interesting theme, BUT either this was made for teenagers or the creators have ignored one major fact: mastermind criminals who have been training for months aren't loose cannons after only 48 hours, having sex with everybody, dwelling on their personal problems, hostages don't develop a Stockholm syndrome in 48 hours, leading police detectives don't go for dates (with criminals!) during a massive hostage drama, and police officers don't turn into drunks and commit suicides in 48 hours. It's just so hilarious that all these people behave like the hostage drama had been going on for weeks and months. One of the funniest things is that the gang takes the eyeglasses of of of the police officers and installs a bug on the frame in front of the police officer, and he doesn't notice anything!! It doesn't help that everybody is overacting so much it hurts. I suppose this was meant as a comedy or a thriller for teenagers. I'm kind of angry that they ruined a good idea this way. What made the original series so great was lost on S3 and 4. The genial and calculated plans by The Professor have been traded for emotinally irrational and borderline idiotic actions by protagonists. Moments of wonder and amusement by the well-made plans are gone, now replaced by fury and anger how the hell have they even survived this long.
Perfection is now chaos. More entertaining? Not for me. Why the high rates! This serie gets dummer and dummer.... Not worth my time..! It started off good, but then everything gets soooooo STUPID. I should go into fortune telling with all the stuff I called out from the get go. NOT GOOD. DO NOT BELIEVE THE HYPE. Anyone who says otherwise is an IDIOT. I am disappointed you didn't do nothing in 4 season better that I didn't watched ... This show started with such a great plot and grandeur but by the 4th season they have lost all the credibility..they are just stretching it episode by episode so they can keep making jt...such a marvellous show is ruined because of greed. The 4th season is horrible and so slow...so many unwanted scenes and dialogues...all RUINED. This series have some suspense but some characters are extremely irritating. It's like Prison Break and more entertaining but some stupid character decisions makes me mad. It ends at season 2. Don't watch season 3. Characters are changing faster then the light moving thorught the universe, unable to track the logic of them and all because of LOVE. That's not a heist movie, it is a romantic comedy of stupidity. I really like the heist part (1/10 of the movie) and it is incredible, but the truth is that Netflix is trying to highlight one part and forgets about the other, too much plot holes, too much drama, too much values that are not in the right place at the right moment of time. I really like heist movies and I thought I was really going to like this show. I watched both part 1 and 2 and in the end this show proved to be a hit and a miss.
Positives
Most of the times it is entertaining if you don't take it seriously.
Some of the actors are really good.<br/><br/>Negatives
Huge plot holes. I will not mention all of them because it would take too much time. For me they completely ruin the main story.
*** WARNING Spoilers ahead ***<br/><br/>The biggest plot holes resolve around the so called "intelligent" Professor:<br/><br/>Why does he tell Angel where he lives? Or at least, in the vicinity of where he lives. Because Angel shows up on his front door soon after that.<br/><br/>Why does he let Angel in his hideout??? This makes no sense whatsoever. Angel can not be sure that Salva is in the building. He could be out, he could have the wrong building. It is really easy to simply not open the door. Angel does not have a search warrant. Also at the same time there was a crisis in the heist so it makes even more sense not to let him in. Still, he lets him in and this allows Angel to take his fingerprint and test the cider. This decision causes the coma of Angel and also lots of suspicion from Raquel.<br/><br/>Why does he let Tokyo take part in the heist? She is completely unstable, cannot take orders or stick to the plan. She is a ticking time bomb and should be nowhere near a heist. Also why does she go back to the Casa after she was set free by the Serbians? A place surrounded with police, snipers and trained gunmen... By some miracle she is not shot (seriously, how can they miss her?) but she still ends up causing Moscow's death.<br/><br/>Why is he alone in the hideout? He hired Serbians but only uses them towards the end. The only smart way to handle the heist is to stay put in the hideout and let the Serbians do the dirty work like remove fingerprints from a car they used or dig. He should have also kept Rio with him in the hideout. The guy is a dead weight in the heist but is a hacker so could be useful working behind the scenes.<br/><br/>Why didn't he let the Serbians dig the hole further towards the vault before they even started the heist. Perhaps someone would notice the noise but i doubt it. Even so, he could have asked the Serbians to start digging again the second his team enters the Casa at the beginning of the heist. El Professor keeps saying that gaining time is key to the success of the heist. Focusing on digging seems obvious but again, this focus comes only at the end.<br/><br/>Why did he make Berlin the leader of the heist? He definitely has leadership qualities but he also ordered a kill of a hostage when there were many other options. Also, the guy is a maniac and litterly rapes a women on the show. El Professor keeps saying that the public needs to approve of the heist but that is difficult with a guy like him. (the character Berlin was a very interesting character played by an amazing actor and a great addition to the show but it just doesn't make any sense to pick him as a leader).<br/><br/>How did he escape to the Filippines? They know how he looks, he was even on TV. They could have easily closed the city streets. And as an extension, the borders/airports etc.<br/><br/>At the end El Professor says that his plan was perfect except for the fact that he fell in love with Raquel. But of course this is complete horse crap because his plan was ridiculsly flawed. It was actually a miracle (and bad police work) that so many of them got out.<br/><br/>The list goes on but you get the point. I can take a few plot holes to force the story to go from point A to B but in this show has a crazy amount. The show simply lacks realism. Plot holes and cliches everywhere, useless and superficial love scenes, stupidest police in TV history and really bad acting. Don't waste your time watching it. Watched 8 episodes yet but took only 8 hours. Couldnt stop watching with all twisted episode ends. Intro video and music amazing. Directing and acting is fine. (Im not used to Spanish show, so.) Story keeps getting you everytime with every new information. Impossible to get bored. A well designed heist plan, extended through season. We're slowly learning plan steps one by one. that keeps couriosity high. i wonder how its gonna end. Hope doesnt take too long for Netflix to air part 2. we need closure and we need it now. What a shame, when building a character so-called "Professor" as a brain but the plan consists of many, many, many risks and illogical things.<br/><br/>Don't bother to list out here, took me to go thru 2 episodes to decide that I would never proceed to the 3rd one.<br/><br/>Don't waste your time, if you're older than 15. I have only watched up to three episodes, and I feel like I just have to review it already. There is no underlying message so do not attempt to look for one. The characters have zero depth, they are all one-dimensional and just full of themselves.There is no sense of realism between all of the underlying drama, and it seems as if they are trying too hard to portray intelligence and depth when actually the entire story-line is woven with denseness. I hope that they all get caught and imprisoned for life by the end of the series, but I guess I'll never know. If you find yourself relating to any of the main characters then, well then good luck, Charlie. :) The series should really have stopped after season 2 (would have rated it an 8). Season 3: too much of the same, even less interesting characters, superficial hollywoodlike plots, and on top of that the caricatural pregnant torturer detective was hard to watch without getting terribly annoyed by the B-movie qualities of her performance and entire appearance. Stopped watching after a several episodes. Once again a motion picture ruined just because cerain people with moneymaking desires don't seem to know when to stop. SPOILER: Immediately after watching 2-3 episodes of S01, I started getting a feeling that there's something not right about this series. I didn't want to judge on spot, so I continued watching. The more I watched, the more it turned out to be as I expected, an amateur, shallow, and weak script, performed by not so interesting characters.<br/><br/>Berlin is good, but the others are meh.<br/><br/>So, this series about a robbery that has been supposedly planned for so long, yet you discover how foolishly it is managed and operated. Many times you see 5-6 kidnappers out of 7 in one room, and you wonder, who's left watching the 40+ kidnapped persons.<br/><br/>The operations room where the detective runs the rescue mission detects any telephone signal within a 30 meters area, yet the assistant manager had a voice recorded injected in his eyeglasses, and he's at the tent, but nothing triggers any warnings! It's not a static voice recorder, it's TRANSMITTING voice signal to the professor!<br/><br/>Lots and lots of simple and stupid overlooks like that make me question the capabilities of the director/writer/producer. I'm not a police officer or IT expert, but I mean it's common sense to consider such details. <br/><br/>It blows my mind to see such TV series and similar movie being rated 8+ on imdb. How? Just HOW? Finished all the part 3 episodes in a single day..Now waiting for part 4 finale... Total stupidity. Does this series shows that Spanish police are brainless and no capable ones are there!! Or is o only professor is the only intelligent person. Too much drama and facts are hard to digest!! This series started well in the first 2 chapters, then declined significantly, especially the 4th season
So the 4th season starts with Nairobi bleeding to death and then she has a perforated lung and then all of a sudden they are able to perform a surgery on her and take the bullet out and boom she survives it.
This series is too vulgar and not mentioning all the useless scenes. Every 5 minutes someone is yelling at someone and they have their gun pointed to their head. LOL
Not to mention the rest of the useless details and how the producers treat the audience as stupid.
Bottom line: Don't watch it The first episodes are quite interesting, but then it's only background drama and a series of silly mistakes happening.<br/><br/>The plot turns out to be ridiculous and brainless... they plan a robbery for 6 months and they can't resist flirting for 48h.... And falling in love with each other. After 10 episodes you just with they kill everyone. Let me start by saying, I think like many others, I was duped into watching this by its high IMDB rating. And because of this series I am 100% convinced that Netflix is paying people to give this show a high rating. I understand that people's tastes vary, however, if you enjoy stories with countless plot holes, unlikable/irritating characters, bad acting, pointless monologues, and complete nonsense, then this is a must watch. In fact, the only reason I watched the whole series, was because of how ridiculous it was. It frequently sent me into fits of laughter.<br/><br/>This did have the potential to be fairly interesting, yet it seems the writers went out of their way to produce complete nonsensical drivel. The story focuses on a group of supposedly highly experienced/intelligent robbers, who plan to take over The Royal Mint of Spain, in order to print and steal vast sums of money, over a two weeks period. <br/><br/>Yet, this group of professionals couldn't be more incompetent. They spend five months prior to the robbery, in a boarding school style setting, run by an equally incompetent professor. Not only are they treated like children, but they also do a good job of acting like children. During the robbery, each of them take turns in making completely pointless mistakes, putting the entire heist in jeopardy. There are many boring monologues between the characters, which offer little substance. A good series would normally have at least one likeable character, either good or bad, where the audience can follow them on a journey and become engrossed in the story. Unfortunately there are no such characters existing in this series. The writers attempt to use the 'sex sells' approach throughout, hoping that the audience will be enticed by random cleavage shots, and hilarious sex scenes.<br/><br/>The lead investigator/hostage negotiator was what really took the biscuit for me. Throughout the series she constantly makes wrong decisions, taking her lunch breaks in a nearby tapas bar, where at one point, she even drinks wine in the middle of her working day. This women is irrational, unstable, and appears to only care about getting laid. Not only has she had a 15 year affair with her closest colleague (who is married), but she also manages to bed the professor, after suspecting him of being in charge of the heist. The plot holes are really endless, and I could go on...<br/><br/>If you enjoy watching high quality productions, then stay well clear of this. On the other hand, if you fancy watching laugh out loud rubbish then get stuck in! Series one and two were a great story, great actors, great cinematography, color-grading... However it was a closed story with a clear end. They should not have continued it and create a third, fourth and even fifth series. This is a great example of creating a sequel just for the profit. Watching this show (Money Heist) may encourage peoples/humans to do bad things more, like stealing money, etc. I hate to admit the show is good like 4/10 but bad for us. I started watching this show before it came on Netflix. I really liked first 2 seasons (it was one season with 15 episodes actually).
It was suspenseful, well thought, thrilling.
It was nearly perfect.
But ever since Netflix got involved and audience became huge, the quality of the show downgraded. Finishing it after 2 seasons would've been perfect.
But no, they had to made more seasons to grab more money and "satisfy" the fans.
Well after finishing season 4 I am not satisfied at all.
So much plot-holes, unnecessary romance drama, flashbacks, irrealstic events...
And many characters became annoying to me.
Season 3 was decent, Season 4 disappointing, I don't wanna imagine how will season 5 turn out.
Maybe I won't even watch it. It's ridiculous that one heist lasts 3 seasons, when in fact the heist shouldn't have happened at all. , It is unfortunate to see this TV show turn into a business show, Part 4 8 episodes Why? A lot of the events like stuffing and stretching ... to see what the upcoming seasons will bring This does not even deserve 1 star, should be 0 stars. ItÂ´s sooo bad. 20 hours I'll never get back. Ridiculous plot. The writing is terrible. How on earth did it get such a score? What a joke... Don't waste your time on this drivel. Now I understand why in Spain this show was a failure. What is this??? This series has absolutely 0 credibility. The script must have been written by a bunch of 10 years old teens (they will forgive me), full of non-sense and totally incoherent. Characters are as convincing as dummies, with no past, no depth, no real personality. It looks like they were just taken out of a manga or borrowed from a cartoon, for the sake of their supposed coolness. This is a cardboard series. If you like being a fool and be treated as one, just watch and enjoy. I have never watched a more garbage TV show in my entire life. The storyline is complete crap, it's overly dramatic and very highly overrated. I felt my blood pressure rise during each episode. Another season of this and I'll have a heart attack. I now use this show as a benchmark to better understand whether the person I'm speaking to is a complete idiot when it comes to TV shows / movies. Except for professor's strategies, every other character and scene is utter waste of time, specially the combat between the police and robbers. All the 18 episodes portray how foolish the police are and how easy it was for 6 robbers to print 1 billion euros in 8-10 days. I mean LOL, come on producer, you should not have portrayed the police to be so lame and easy to crack down upon.<br/><br/>Please do not watch if you believe that action movies/series should have logic in them. If you don't care about your time and don't believe in logic, please go ahead and do watch it. Nothing more that a stupidity-meter device to measure the low level intelligence of population. And it works. 8.7/10!! Is this for real? Sic trasit gloria mundi. Season 3 and 4 are just dumb content and i assume 5 will be worse, season 1 and 2 are good watch though How many bullets does it take to kill one man? The show is getting ridiculous and cheesy in its 4th season. I made it too far to quit now, but I agree with a previous reviewer about how these characters seem too incompetent to pull off a money heist. I suppose the writers also want you to feel they are good guys sticking it to the government without really wanting to hurt any innocents. Not sure how much longer this can keep up. See the reviews of other users - almost everyone is saying that it should have ended at season 2 and there was literally no need of unnecessary lame sequels, especially when season 2 had the perfect climax.
8 stars are for seasons 1 and 2
2 stars for season 3 and 4. How stupid can a police inspector be? Watch this to find out. A robbery is a crime. You cannot glorify it. Stupid plot. Implausible. I watched the whole first 2 seasons by skipping ahead as 70,% of the scenes were full of cringe worthy emotional melodrama. Hyping up stupidity.<br/><br/>Can watch but don't expect logic and common sense.<br/><br/>Deserves at the most 6-7 ðŸŒŸ I very much enjoyed season 1&2. Season 2 ending was beautiful and they should have stopped at there. Season 3 is not that bad and Don't ask about season 4. Take my advice and don't watch s4. Season was just completely out if order and they tried so hard to make surprises and all that but they tried too hard.. The shooting scene was the worst piece of TV show I've watched so many bullets aimed at a dude with no cover and he survived.. RIDICULOUS I am just finishing season 2 and I don't get the hype. Acting is really bad, love story is cringe worthy and character development is really messy.<br/><br/>I carried on watching it to see if season 2 will get any better, but no. I gave up after 4-5episodes, it became really silly although I see the potential. But mainly the storylines of the people outside the bank are ridiculous. There is a big big robbery with hostages going on and the chief negotiator goes out every now and then to get a sandwich in a nearby bar? Where she meets the brain of the robbery? And can't leave her daughter with her ex because he's claimed to be violent, but can leave her with her dementing mother?...and when the ex takes the child (and brings it back after a few hours), again she leaves the scene of the robbery to solve a domestic issue?
oh get real...<br/><br/>I found out I was fast-forwarding the episodes for the moments outside the bank. Could probably have been a nice movie, but as series too much silliness is added. A good idea Is becoming a sequence of foolishness and repetitions. Basically a repetitive soap opera with guns. After a long await, I was so curious to watch this season and today it released and I finished couple of hours back. The expectations were a lot for this series, but didn't turned out be so well. The stories is a little dragging from the first episode, few unwanted things happened in between, can't expect our professor to lose his cool, which he happened a lot if times. Looks like they were struggling to extend the episodes and which in turn doesn't look like a very good decision. And finally not a spoiler, but an alert to the people who are very curious like me : it's not the end of the heist, there will be one more season coming for this to end.<br/><br/>Gist: It's again a wait for another season to follow to complete the heist, which is really sad to say the least and hence 3/10. This show is highly overrated. It does not deserve the high ratings. At first the concept seems interesting which is why I gave it a chance. But the story is unrealistic. You forget that the heist has only been taking place for 5 days with how quickly everyone falls in love and how quick gun shot wounds seem to heal. Considering this show's rating and recommendations from friends, I was expecting a good show. In reality, it's below average.<br/><br/>The good things are the visuals and their main plan to print money rather than steal existing money.<br/><br/>The masks are just knock offs of V for Vendetta. The code names and rules scene is straight out of Reservoir Dogs. So what's new? You have specialists like Oceans 11, except here, they are all immature morons that you wonder why the "genius" professor picked them. Tokyo and the main detective are unbearably annoying and the way the plot move is ridiculous.<br/><br/>A ridiculous plot would be fine if the show leaned into with a funny tone like Guardians of the Galaxy, but this show takes itself so seriously as if it is Breaking Bad and you roll your eyes.<br/><br/>In the first episode, when the show thinks it is at its most epic, the narrator says, "We went through this plan 30 times. We shoot near the police...but the professor never said...the police would shoot back"...SERIOUSLY?<br/><br/>That's another thing, narrating/voice over is the laziest kind of writing. It's always better to SHOW not constantly TELL.<br/><br/>Being over an 8/10 is really over rating this thing. Fot me season 1 & 2 was very good but when they get famously and announced seasons 3 its ok until that and now s04 is fully disappointed.
#Please stop milking that COW Do yourself a favor and don't even start this series. I pushed through season 1 and regret doing that cause I felt committed and had to see it through. What a disappointment and 17 hours of my life I'll never get back. The plot is poor, the storyline is predictable and the acting. Oh my the acting, just terrible. I actually was forwarding through episodes in the last season cause I knew by then what was filler and what was, and I use this term loosely, important. Just don't do it. You've been warned. Usually can't stand to watch something in another language, but with this action packed series couldn't stop watching episode after episode. Can't wait for the next season, and how come netflix hasn't uploaded the last two episodes! How on earth did it get such a score?
What a joke... I expected far better than this. This Tv series is far too long, too much "fat", useless moments and characters, the playing is awful, unbelievable at the most, and this TV show is not brutal, not bloody enough for this kind of subject, of scheme. The producers intended to involve the largest audiences possible. Home audiences, the whole family. This brought cheesy situations, for sissies. NOT FOR ME. But I admit that there are good story lines, in the basic scheme, I mean, and interesting situations. But the whole is jeopardized by this non sense destined, I repeat, for the largest audiences possible. It has some good and unexpected moments, but also lots of thin plot points. It's written in the usual millennial style: lengthen the thing again and again. And again.<br/><br/>But the worst aspect is watching the characters having relationships and often taking the dumbest possible decisions. I would like to say they are totally unrealistic, but it's worse, it's like watching the Big Brother on tv: a bunch of crazy, narcissistic and brainless guys, fu**ing, fighting and switching sides all the time.<br/><br/>Tokyo, Rio and Angel are extremely unlikeable, Nairobi and Denver almost are. Some of them are very badly acted. On the other hand, Berlin and Moscow are interesting and well acted characters. The Professor is just, well, the Professor. This show went from an highly well written heist, to an extremely awkward soap opera. The show did horrible in Spain until it hit Netflix. After becoming extremely popular, they hurry up and write a second heist. They are dragging one heist out with three seasons. I can't believe it went from sew good to so bad. What a disappointment Season 4 total disappointment. The whole seasom can be compleed in 2 episodes and but extended like a rubber band. Boring. Not watching season 5. I gave season one and two of this show a much deserved 10/10 but I'm at a loss to understand why they made season 3?<br/><br/>Season 3 is the antithesis of the former seasons. It ruins the mostly light hearted vibe that had been established, replacing it with something much darker. Worse still, its simply, in many respects, a blatant re-hash of what went before.<br/><br/>Like Star Wars, this feels like making something for the sake of making it. I'm happy to have had the first two seasons and will be leaving it there.<br/><br/>5/10 for season 3. The show has its merits. The camera work and aesthetics are very well taken care of. I enjoyed it as a visual experience.
The problem are the characters and the story.
In a similar way to the TV series "Lost", at the end of each episode there's a forced suspence-generating situation. This is not bad per se. What I didn't like is that the suspense situations most times get resolved quickly in the next chapter and in an absurd way, in a deus ex machina style, without any intelligent plot integration.
About the characters, I found most of them very irritating. Many times during the show I thought "how silly/ridiculous is what he/she's doing!".
Most women are depicted as impulsive and irrational, and only men display an adult use of their brain without the interference of their hormones. This promotes gender stereotypes. Why can't women think coldly and rationally? The main female inspector is particularly irrational and careless about respecting police protocols.
Also the spanish police is depicted as very incompetent. Most of their snipers wouldn't be able to hit an elephant at ten meters of distance.
I believe that this show is overvalued, or that most rankings aren't coming from a trustworthy source, otherwise I cannot understand the hype. Strong points are the cast and the ingenious plotting. But after the first few episodes it starts to drag and but episode 10 you're into "sunk cost fallacy" - I've spent 10 hours of my life on this series so it make sense to see it through to the end.<br/><br/>But doing so and you have to endure the most absurd plot holes and character behaviour. The lead cop takes off for the evening and leaves her mobile phone off for 24 hours whilst the siege reaches a climax; snipers are ordered to shoot one of the gang on the roof but only fire one shot, allowing the gang member (hostage in a mask) to live; hostages blow a hole in the wall and escape but the police, apparently having no snipers to fell the villains, nor flash-bangs to subdue them, fail to enter the building, thereby prolonging the siege. "Alison Parker, daughter of the British Ambassador" does not appear to have been anywhere near Britain. <br/><br/>All very silly and just moderately entertaining. All the characters in this series are idiot. I expected to see some smart people solve some hard puzzles. But there are only problems created by idiot characters. And these problems are getting solved by another idiot, the professor, with the most idiotic way.<br/><br/>Stay away from this series if you think you have couple of brain cells. You know how it is on a foreign trip. You turn on the hotel TV and if you're not fluent in the language, you zone out and half-follow the picture. And then you have your typical soap opera actors - some of them can't act, but are photogenic, some of them can sort of act and aren't photogenic, and some of them are required only to pretend to be in a coma. Most of them overact (or over non-act), because the scarcity of acting work means they've never come up against a decent director who would have told them to tone it down a bit. Even the guy in a coma.<br/><br/>Wardrobe? Red overalls, mainly. The hairdresser tried really hard, though.<br/><br/>Then there's the script. Obviously, your series creator has got a thing about planting false clues for the forensic team, because the fact that the man with fake irritable bowel syndrome has done this in advance is the main source of suspense - you're supposed to be waiting for the CSI team to catch on. No doubt they will, when they get over their break-up issues.<br/><br/>Then the man who doesn't have Stockholm syndrome - a syndrome from Stockholm, they explain - tries to explain to the woman who does have Stockholm syndrome (from Stockholm) that it's just not going to work out between them. Even if they go to Sweden.<br/><br/>And then - and then - the Professor hasn't answered the phone for 24 hours. Gripping? So is duct tape. Except duct tape doesn't go on as long.<br/><br/>Whoever wrote this junk tries to cover themselves by randomly throwing in a car crash, or a Hispanic standoff, or a completely unconvincing love scene every ten minutes, so that people who can't get off the sofa in less than ten minutes have an excuse to stop trying.<br/><br/>I like trash TV as much as the next hombre but this is weak, derivative and not even fun. Anyone tells you it's 'unmissable' should be kept at 50m distance. Loved watching first few episodes, and then! Such a unreal storyline.
<ul><li>People fall madly in love in 5 days.. willing to go to any lengths for love, including a police officer.</li><li>Civilians can fire guns like pros ( Monica)</li><li>The police can never hit a target but the robbers are pros</li></ul>The list goes on and on.
Gripping but completely ridiculous, unbelievable story line . Leave your logic in a corner, then you will enjoy it This movie is a MASTERPIECE. It has every characteristic of it: Good actors, great story, very funny, extremely emotional, you feel like jumping from joy, crying with them... Impossible to stop watching.
Must watch ! It was fun and wonderful and the plot of the story is beautiful It started out very well, then became so silly.<br/><br/>Really disappointing I watched about 4 episode of this before giving up. The premise was good but it all quickly descended into farce. Genuinely haven't a clue how this mess of a show became this popular. This series is total garbage, it should end by four episodes but no they decided to make money not by heist but by producing its four seasons and that's the heist yeah
Characters are so dumb and stupid, and not to forget how it got stretched, horrible decision to watch it I need to donate my eyes now Don't bother watch this soap opera kind of heist, don't waste your time, it's not worth it, it's too unrealistic, no plot at all, terrible writers with exceptional cast, this used to be a good show couple of years go, now it turned out to be a meh and continue going downhill, stop the hype and please don't continue the season anymore. It should be the end totally. Seasons one and two are ok. Good character developing and good plot. The even deserve an 7-8 if you ask me.<br/><br/>But the continuation is a joke to all the viewers. Lame plot, lame character developing and disastrous storytelling. The voice-over from Tokyo is really annoying, and they try to make her a strong and brave character out of nowhere. She is obviously not that person. All along the series she showed what she is, a girl who only likes to have fun and not so much more.<br/><br/>Some of the characters are incoherent as they have fears of pity things but they can assault a bank with no problem.<br/><br/>Also, the entire series make an obviously apology to theft, showing it like "justified" and something good. A lame "anti-system" ideology in a millionaire Netflix series, the hypocrisy describes itself.<br/><br/>The season 3 and 4 are like a corpse with no soul, made only for making money, even the acting declined here. Things don't make sense, and the plot looks like it isn't thought anymore.<br/><br/>Some of the worst series that I've watched 1/10 Sure, the idea of the show is smart and entertaining: a bunch of elite criminals working together to rob billions of dollars. Some of the characters such as Berlin are professional and smart, which is good for the plot. It could have been a great series. But the show went downhill after Tokyo's relation with Rio is introduced. Their love is not reasonable at all and Tokyo kept using love as an excuse to ruin the plan of the entire team, putting everyone in danger but did not pay for her mistakes. Besides, there are just so many plot holes in the show that I don't want to spoil here. The police are totally dumb and useless that they deal with the criminals in such stupid and inefficient methods. Many of the characters in the show does not help develop the plot but just annoy the audience so much, one of them being Tokyo who is so immature and arrogant which kept bringing trouble to the whole team. The actions of the characters are simply not understandable and the show simply doesn't deserve such a positive rating. I would have given it a better rating if not for the annoying characters and plot. Such thrilling topic simply doesn't mix well with undeveloped and sudden emotions and love between the characters. It all started great, solid performance overall. Really good way to interpert the system and how a clever team led by a genius can hurt all that corruption. But after season 2, things got way too repetitive and exagerated. It became dumb. Alpha male ladies who make compulsive decisions. The same characters doing exactly the same mistakes. You can predict pretty much every move they'll do after season 2. It could have been an amazing tv show, but it ended up as on of the worst ones in my list. HUGE CLICHE. S1 & S2 were great and i'd give them both 8/10, but 3&4 i'd give only 3/10, especially the 4th season.<br/><br/>First of all, both latest seasons were full of clever ideas and plans, but they were presented in a messy way, which led to lowering the quality of the story.<br/><br/>The relationships issues were problematic and made nonsense, there were a lot of overdrama brought just to make a tragic or sad story out of nothing, i mean they were tacky and boring.<br/><br/>HUGE MISTAKES
Seeing how much the professor is a geniues makes you intuitive for each plan and each problem happens. A lot of stupid simple problems and mistakes that happenned to get bigger and more diffucult were easy to fix and should've been a part of the plan from the begining since he is always predictible of every problem that might happen and what is the soultion plan for it!<br/><br/>The acting in general is good; i'd say the actors who played Berlin, Nairobe and the inspector Seira were very good. But the others were just good.<br/><br/>I didn't find the flashbacks, especially the dramatic ones, useful or intresting, they were most of the time boring.<br/><br/>Camera, direction and production were at their best.<br/><br/>I don't like how they tried to make them look heroes, i mean okay most of us felt emotional toward the thieves, but i didn't understand the protests and the buzz around them in the show.<br/><br/>I find the first and second seasons great, i enjoyed them so much, season three was good and averagely entertaining but season four was bad that you can skip directly to ep 7 and you wouldn't miss anything.<br/><br/>I just think they should've stopped after season 2. Overrated. The first two seasons trundle along and are entertaining enough. The third season starts off well, but by the time they get to their second heist, it's all turned to mush, with a score that begins to get irritating because it feels like they're just showcasing songs, and drawn-out love scenes that make you want to puke.
I couldn't take any more than S3E7. The first two seasons were great! It was a very good plot and the whole story was perfect until the ending. Wit season 3 they did an okayish job I think and it was also nice to follow the new storyline. Season 4 is again one of this typical Netflix-bullsh...! They only try to make as much money as they can and the story is lengthened way too much! It starts to get boring! After watching 5 episodes I found myself actually searching for bad comments about this series. I couldn't believe that I was the only one who found this series very very very bad.
The acting is worse that the average soap series. The professor is irritating. The main characters are fighting all the time and make really unlogical descisions. I noticed that I was getting irritated by the stupid choices...."the dad needs some fresh air, so they go up to the roof with 30 hostages...???? Please tell me why....
I will not spend more time on watching this and I suggest you don't either. Childish plot, totally unrealistic and full of plot holes. Mr professor should give us the lottery numbers as it seems he knows everything before it happens. The perfect robbery is getting the money and escape as soon as possible. On this earth at least... No spoilers here, unless we're talking about spoiled garbage. What garbage, and that's being a bit unkind to actual garbage. It doesn't really deserve to be associated with junk like this movie. The acting sucked, and for a while I thought it would turn into a parody movie but to my disappointment it didn't. Maybe I'm too spoiled by good shows, but I could not believe this show is for real. This is a low-level soap opera that anyone with any intelligence or self-respect will stay away from. Trivial, unimaginative, over-dramatized...and just empty on every level. Bad writing, bad acting, cliche after cliche and superficial love stories behind every corner. Everything is somehow too personal and in your face, without any taste or nuance. Characters exchange mean gossipy blows below the belt that even teenage girls wouldn't think of. Imagine the first interaction between two high-level detectives solving the hostage crisis being "I know about your problems with your ex-husband". Yes, it's that stupid. Oh, and the damage this show will do -- male characters constantly make rude/ sexist comments, while one of the female characters (uneducated, loud, over-confident and arrogant) slaps them for it and wins the day. Laughably cheap and obnoxious, but I'm afraid effective attempt to push her as role model to young girls. God save us.. This series is masterpiece tv series on criminal genre after Breaking Bad! So freaking love! Many, I included, use this platform as a way to be efficient with time and try to seek out what would seemingly be the best TV-shows and movies with little research needed. Apart from niche types of films which are either loved or hated, IMDB used to be a very reliable source, but as time passed and as it grew in popularity, we see more and more instances of unworthy titles getting flooded with 10-star ratings which (sometimes) get balanced by just as many 1-star ratings, leaving you with a funny inverted Bell curve. This isn't how things SHOULD work, but unfortunately, this is what we get.<br/><br/>Let's start with the good first. I initially found the story interesting, since the general plot is original and ingenious. And that's about it. This could've been a great series, so let me tell you where I personally think things went wrong: 
It all starts with the writing. The writing is ATROCIOUS. As I stated above, although the GENERAL plot and story were great, as the entire thing unfolded mistakes upon mistakes started piling up, forming plot holes, hilariously impossible and nonsensical scenarios. The characters seemed all one or two-dimensional, and most never even saw the shadow of any sort of character development. As I kept watching I soon came to realize that this show was made to be mindlessly watched, catering to the masses with their daily dose of sex, violence, and tension, while delivering very little substance to reflect on. And to make all of this worse, couple it with some (very) bad acting (not sure because of the directing or the actors themselves). In the end, La Casa del Papel is entertaining for those who seek to procrastinate filling their time with nothingness, but if you're actually looking for a complex and well-written TV-Series you might want to look elsewhere. (the two best examples of this I could give are Westworld S 1&2 and/or True Detective S1, a true masterpiece).
True rating: 5/10 Modern Robinhood gang!
With EL S.D mask!
EL SALVADORE DALI MASK!!
Its never about the money, its about the system.<br/><br/>Which is more evil?
To rob a bank or to invent one?
In 2011, the European Central Bank made 171 billion Euro out of nowhere.
Do you know where all that money went?
To the banks.
Directly from the factory to the pockets of the rich.
Did anyone call the European Central Bank a thief?
No.
'Liquidity injections,' they called it.
The Dalis make a liquidity injection,
but not for the banks.
#bellaciao Everything in this show is just obvious. every character in this show is acting stupid! you cant connect with anyone. i really wonder why a lot of people like this show. I believe this is a Spanish series, so I'm watching it dubbed over in English. I'm not sure if this has lead to me missing some vibes because some of the storylines and relationships just appear out of nowhere.<br/><br/>I thought this might be a bit of a quirky series to watch, but it just ended up trying to work out what's actually going on. I wasn't sure if I was watching a serious heist series or if it was some kind of joke. The whole heist theme is pretty much irrelevant and is just something to give this series a title.<br/><br/>The first episodes make you think all of the team have been specially selected for their skills, but they all end up just being idiots.<br/><br/>Having said that I can't stop watching it even though I have very little idea of what's going Because the whole thing is dubbed over I can just say that's why it didn't make sense. So..<br/><br/>The third season was nothing, the director should end the series after the second season. In the third season, things starting to be little over and too much..
I mean they had created a new boring story and they are trying to put one of the great characters from the last seasons in the third one and the fourth.
Things started to be little silly and more fiction, just like an Indian movie, and even more!! Just sex and Full of extra marrital affairs. Honestly i wasted my time watching the first season itself. The first season was great, a solid 9. It was kind of a spin on Inside Man, my favorite Spike Lee movie (closely followed by Malcolm X).<br/><br/>But already in the second season the show metaphorically jumps the shark when a character literally jumps a motorcycle. Things quickly go south from there.<br/><br/>Season 2 had a natural ending. But of course Netflix has to keep beating that dead horse. Season 3 onward make no sense whatsoever.<br/><br/>Characters - who are now experienced bank robbers, mind you - keep making the dumbest decisions imaginable in order to fill the run time. The professor's planning skills were a stretch already back in the first season, but by season 3-4 he must have developed superpowers. Tertiary characters are thrown into the mix without introduction whenever they write themselves into a jam and the professor is so omniscient that it reminds me of another deus ex machina device, namely "The Company" from another ridiculous show that went on far too long, Prison Break.<br/><br/>The acting is for the most part over the top. Tokyo poses like she's on a runway, Denver is chewing the scenery whenever he's on the screen, and I hoped that we would finally be rid of a certain performer after season 2, but of course that performer is hamming it up again in plenty of dreadfully boring flashbacks in seasons 3-4 which seem to take up almost as much run time as the heist.<br/><br/>But the only thing more over the top than the music and the brain dead writing is the music, which is blaring at full speed constantly. A little tip to the composer: If everything is emphasized with dramatic music, in the end nothing is emphasized. Less is more.<br/><br/>The only reason I don't give this a lower score is because of the fantastic first and serviceable second season. Season 3-4 deserve no higher than a 3 rating. I watched 3 episodes and here my description of this title: a dumb professor hires a bunch of dumb paranoid impulsive criminals putting the biggest idiots in key roles of the heist hoping that these imbeciles can follow his plan and no, it is not a comedy. The whole thing is just too dumb, I agree that it is definitely original, in the dumb way. If you watch Ocean's Eleven 11th time you get a lot more entertainment then this parody. This does not even deserve 1 star, should be 0 stars. After seeing a guy with a laptop hacking security system ..... this was way toooooooo fake , i couldn' t watch this stupidy This show is super sexist. Anyone who cannot see it is either blind or just believe in a male-dominated world, and you can't reason with those type of people.
I started to watch it, because a lot of people recomanded it. now I should take a closer look at who are my friends. Countless plot holes, underdeveloped characters and idiotic storyline - don't waste your time on this tv show and don't believe the high rating scam orchestrated and paid for by Netflix! After watching 4 episodes I went back the the ratings on Google, I just cannot understand how this is ranked so hi, other than these are false reviews. This series is absolutely ridiculous, the writer director just fills up 50 minutes of mindless dialogue with a boring storyline and then says " cut " 
What a waste of my time and the producers money. I am starting to get the feeling Netflix just wants to produce hours and hours of content and nothing of quality. Shame on you Netflix! I started watching this show because of all the great ratings it has received. And I'm sorry but I just don't get it. This show is absolutely terrible. <br/><br/>Many of the positive reviews talk about how unpredictable it is. Yet I find the show highly predictable at every single turn in every single episode. <br/><br/>The infighting between the different police agencies during the hostage taking is laughable. This is been done over and over and over. <br/><br/>These bank robbers have to be the sadest bad guys (and girls) a TV series has ever had. <br/><br/>To each his own I suppose, but I recommend taking a pass on this one. <br/><br/>Oh, the acting is B level. This is addictive to the point that you don't understand how you've watched it all at once.<br/><br/>It's unpredictable, it's suspenseful, it's twisted, it's AMAZING!<br/><br/>Why it has so many mixed reviews here I really don't get it. Probably because of some inaccuracies with the plot.<br/><br/>I for one sometimes need a show that gives me those extreme emotions. This was one of them, I enjoyed it a lot. It starts off great and then gets worse and worse.
The Professor is THAT almighty that the whole show is boring as hell. First I really thought - no joke - that this is a fan-fiction the Professor wrote about himself as he is absolutely flawless, knows everything, is allowed everywhere, seduces the most important woman in the show without problems (even it is said that he is completely helpless in those situations) It is so... frustrating and bad, it kills every suspension.<br/><br/>Everything that happens always swings in favor of the criminals, mostly because of the Professor who resolves any problems within seconds and never, never, never gets any problems. He is always on the perfect spot for everything he wants to accomplish. And it aaaalways works out, it is so bad.<br/><br/>But the most annoying thing is that this show really wants us to believe that the bad guys are the good ones. Women falling in love with them even they're risking other hostages lives. But lets not forget: They terrorized 67 people with great fear, giving them mental scars for live, forced a woman into sexslavery(!), risking health and mind of so many people. They threatened them, they put them in danger, they tortured them!
AND THEN - no joke - it takes one sentence(!) from Berlin in an Interview to bring ALL People around the world on their side? That is insulting for ALL people who ever were in such situations.
Those people would even make a show about a concentration camp in Nazi-Germany into an all funny-Nazi-Mess... Don't let the good score and reviews fool you.<br/><br/>La Casa De Papel IS NOT about a heist. La Casa De Papel IS NOT about their plan. La Casa De Papel is just another teenage drama speaking spanish rather than english.<br/><br/>I love the european cinema. It always calls my attention because contrary to Hollywood, I have the feeling they always try to innovate their formulas, and La Casa De Papel is no different.<br/><br/>As I mentioned, it's a teenage drama. And yes, it's innovative because of its heist background-a merit I can't deny.<br/><br/>But don't get me wrong: their innovativeness fails in every aspect but the innovation itself.<br/><br/>Characters are all dumb, including acting-except Berlin,-omnipresent plot holes, stereotypes everywhere, and the problems they face aren't intelligently or logically resolved.<br/><br/>Most of the solutions are improvised-despite the months on planning to actually perform the heist,-gambling-based, or poorly developed. When they can't think in something that doesn't fit any of these categories, there's the last resort: a very stupid, irrational bi-polar character called Rio which is the xXYoung_HackerXx that has the superpowers of create bombs, bypass any security system created by the most advanced security companies of Spain, go to the gym and shoot with guns-all this alone, by the age of 19 and at once! The new McGayver is Spanish!<br/><br/>If you like a teenage drama, go for it. It really has the merit of entertain, but hardly fails when it comes to seriousness. If you are looking for a detailed, well-executed with great acting heist piece, just forget it. There's no brilliance here. At all. And oh, the ending is just... bad. Predictable to say the least. Just finished watching season 2 in a stretch and I want more of this. This is a refreshment to the audience. The cast is very mature in its acting, dialogues are crisp and the background score is icing on the cake.<br/><br/>The script is epic and screenplay is brilliant which grasps you til the ea=nd with the nail biting drama. You will keep asking yourself 'What will happen next ?'
You will connect to each of the characters in one or the other way. <br/><br/>I just can't end my review without mentioning Pedro Alonso who plays 'Berlin'. A standing ovation to this gentleman. I won't go into the detail but you will love and hate him at the same time.<br/><br/>This is a must watch.
Cheers. The first series was intelligent, fun and full of surprises. The second series was as if a bunch of students were given a project to redo the entire series, got drunk or high, and produced this swill.<br/><br/>So much talking and terrible acting trying to evoke emotions but given the absolutely ridiculous plot and even worse dialogue. Fail!!!<br/><br/>Just awful!! First two seasons were really good to watch.
season 3 : idea is already messed up. People who saved their life and their impossible plan worked want to risk their life and do it again. For which reason, for a stupid mistake.
Season 4 : Writing was VERY BAD!!
<ul><li>Very slow plot u can find no advancement in the actions, 9 episodes just for dead member and returned member.</li><li>Writing is very unrealistic : love stories in a very serious situations as if they are playing or something, seems like they are doing these to feed episodes.</li><li>Those flashbacks were unnecessary,</li><li>BRAINWASHING!! : they force u to watch unwanted scenes, as they include interesting conversation in it. Brain dirtying !!</li></ul>-unrealistic scenes : the security guy is immune to guns, wins against 6 people, when arturo got the gun from one the members and that secret member showed up the other member could easily beat him from behind instead he was waiting hah It starts with a strong note, a good story and great characters but soon it starts falling down from reality to fiction and filmy story..
I would have preferred if they had stuck to the original story of a brilliant perfect plan and conquering obstacle instead of over using the Stockholm syndrome to a level where even police would start to help them.
By the time the second season ends, I just wanted to quit watching it but I was hopeful it would get better. It didn't.
Somehow it convinces you by the end of the show that robbers were good people and the police was bad in trying to save the people.
I don't know why they wanted to glorify the robbers and showcase the bank robbery as a great revolutionary thing.
None had done any great service to anyone by robbing the mint.
Who were they fighting against and what was the resistance?
It turned from a brilliant series to a extremely stupid one in a very short time.
I still don't know what the craze is all about. The plot is full of loopholes, the rhythm is tardiness, and the acting is pompous, completely dishonor Netflix's reputation. Pinch my nose and shorten my pain by fast forwarding. I do not hesitate to give ONE star! I don't know why there are so many positive review seriously... Watched the whole season before writing this.
Acting is very good but...the plot is not. Most of the robbers reactions are stupid. If what you want is watching high quality content don't watch this. There's no social criticism or whatever...really.<br/><br/>SPOILER : Tokyo's voice over will spoil the end of the show on episode 1 in the first minutes. Bad Story. Bad plot. Bad characters. 
This is the worstest series I´ve ever seen.
I just gave two stars for the sharp images ... ;) <br/><br/>
All charakters want be professional hijackers or professional cops.
 
But I never ever saw a movie or a series with so many stupid characters. They occupied a bank. For days. OK. And the cops don´t cut of the energy supply of the building???
Seriously?? 
lol. One of the best series I've seen in a long time, it's exciting from the first to the last episode, I love it! 
Berlin character for me was the best, I had some great laughs with him. No smart writing. Tokyo is such an annoying character. So is the professor. Could've done it better. They could learn a thing or two from shows like 24, Prison Break etc. No thrill whatsoever. It's a very average show. Only people who can find it thrilling are people who aren't familiar to this genre and haven't watched a lot of masterpieces. I'm super pissed at the inspector and the fact that the professor, by chance or by design, is ALWAYS aware of police next steps and plans. Yeah, the inspector is idiot and is in violation of police protocols basically with every breath she takes, but if it's not her, there are other ridiculous, unthinkable ways the Professor gains crucial information. I'm not a police officer and even I understand that it's NOT OKAY to let ANYONE inside the building that you are currently investigating (House, where gang was getting ready for robbery), let alone have a stranger drive you there. WHAT THE ACTUAL HELL! This show wants so much to be taken as a serious crime caper, but lacks any kind of believable hard edge in its execution, so much so that that were the sex (needless) & violence (comic book) removed, it could easily be rebroadcast as children's TV.<br/><br/>The "heist" itself could be (and should have been) whittled down from 19 episodes (13 in Series 1 + 6 in Series 2) to about 3. There is more filler in this than in your local DIY store, so much so that what little drama actually remains is diluted and left to drown in an ocean of ponderous navel-gazing, tedious monologues and largely irrelevant side stories. The lesson seems to be that if you are ever invited on a job with a group of Spanish robbers, along with your M16 and explosives don't forget to pack some Belgian chocolates, a dozen red roses and a box of condoms. Just in case.<br/><br/>But, of course, the real elephant in the room: even non-criminals these days know that a large amount of unaccounted for cash is basically worthless. Didn't the phrase "money laundering" ring any bells with The Professor or, more importantly, the writers? Try buying something relatively small like a new car with cash and see how far you get without having to first prove where the money came from.<br/><br/>Modern professional thieves are more interested in precious stones, rare metals or untraceable bonds and steer clear of large amounts of paper money. Yet here we are in 2017 and a gang of dimwits think they are committing the crime of the century running off with nearly a billion Euros in freshly minted paper currency, 963 million of which is in the same denomination. <br/><br/>It's the crime of the century all right, but the last century - not this one. Years of planning and they'd all be caught and banged up within a matter of weeks. I started watching it due to how well everyone talked about this show, and let me tell you I was impressed. Great acting, plot, soundtrack...A true masterpiece that kept me begging for more. Keep it up Netflix According to the ratings, this show should be on par with series like Black Mirror or Stranger Things - but, if you enjoy the latter two you will find this to be complete gibberish. The writing is as poor as it gets and it requires you to completely suspend your reason and logic in order to follow the plot. I personally found myself unable to sympathize with any of the characters, they are badly done and none of them is even remotely smart or complex. I am still only half way through watching it, and if I do finish watching it, it will be merely to be able to form a complete critical view of it. But my mind is made up already about what I have seen so far. I heard all of my friends say that I needed to see "La Casa de Papel". So I thought I'd give it a try. I liked the show in general, but it is so unrealistic at times. If you love over the top action movies or just another crime series then this one is for you. But definitely do not expect "the best series ever". It's a DECENT series and I would give it a 6/10. 
Entertaining for once, but not gonna watch or recommend this series again. Great series! Writing, acting, characters are on target. Crooks are both smart and dumb, like real criminals. You get to know the characters and come to like some from the start, like others early and then come to dislike them and two of them (for me) were never likeable (one a weasel, the other a bully). The plot twists and turns and leaves you wondering how this new problem will be resoved. Delightful.<br/><br/>I recommend against binge watching this. Watch an episode a day -- kind of like a wonderful piece of candy once a day -- it's a treat. I watch whole 2 season in a single go. Before I start, I saw some people rate low this series. I honestly highly recommend other not to consider negative comment. If this series isn't best then no series will be good than this. <br/><br/>Anyway, heist planning and making and acting all was tremendous. I enjoyed every piece of episode. Director knows how to make TV series. I have been always fan of crime, thriller and twists. This series was perfect for my taste. No other series can beat it. I liked Breaking bad, Game of thrones, The sinner, Dark but La casa de papel (Money heist) is exceptionally good. I highly recommend everyone to watch this show. Worth time spending on this show. <br/><br/>One more thing, this is a TV series not a true event. I know something which can never be done in real life, but who cares. May be it can be. However I enjoyed this show very very much. And I want to congratulate all actors and directors and all production crews. Mind blowing job guys. Keep it up! and Make this type of TV series more and more. <br/><br/>I am still very much excited :D Many many thanks for my heart. This show is amazing, truly a piece of art. It is extremely hard to stop watching this show, it nabs you and settles you in for a great ride. This is the most overrated show i have ever seen, the downhill is so hard that it hurt me psychologically. The romance is very bad and stupid with no sense plot. The characters in the beginning seem to be very pro and you can find later that they are a bunch of amateurs, they will make you hate the characters instead of develop them, the insteresting ones...well... you will see the show calls you for the plottwist and the drama but there is like only 2/3 things that happens that you will think "damn nice..." the rest is only them arguing and pointing themselves with the guns lol. the ending is cliche and the story plot has many fails. its sad because it had potencial but they just downhill the show. Like one reviewer said, if you enjoy stories with countless plot holes, unlikable/irritating characters, bad acting, pointless monologues, and complete nonsense, then this is a must watch.
Season 3 is worse.
if you want to enjoy it, turn off your brain. This show is too much alike to the movie "inside man" of 2006 in wich Denzel Washington and Clive Owen make a perfect interpretation.
The same turns... and the same tricks to fool the police... there are so little differences. 
They could do something diferent but the copy the same thing.
If you are thinking of watch this show... better see the movie "Inside man" that is way better than this one and is original. 
The performance of the actors are ok... 
Is well filmed..
But is a copy ... The writing is as poor as it gets and it requires you to completely suspend your reason and logic in order to follow the plot. I personally found myself unable to sympathize with any of the characters, they are badly done and none of them is even remotely smart or complex. This is one of the stupidest shows I have ever seen in my entire life. I know there has to be an element of suspension of disbelief, but his show requires you to but your brain in the trash bin while you watch this. Plan not using it all. The characters are so stupid and pathetic and one dimensional. DONÂ´T WASTE YOUR TIME. Spanish audience seems to be smart because, in Spain, this show was a failure. This show is an unrivaled masterpiece. I want to give it a 12/10. I found it on a complete whim and was drawn in immediately. If subtitles aren't your thing, fear not, you'll forget they're even there halfway through the first episode. The acting is superb, the storytelling is insanely wonderful and the number of left turns this thing takes will literally make your head explode. i can only hope a part 4 is in the works. I want more and more and more of this, please. This is my first review on imdb, I just had to write my thoughts. It's a brilliant show, an absolute gem, might be my favorite tv series ever (matter of taste, obviously).<br/><br/>Intelligent cat & mouse game with tons of twists and excellent characters. You have no idea what will happen, it's full of suspense and chances are you won't be able to stop watching.<br/><br/>I watched 10 episodes on Netflix in one night, which didn't happen to me since the first season of Prison Break (with which this show is very similar).<br/><br/>PS (for those who didn't watch it all): There are 15 episodes of 70 minutes each. Netflix took the first 9 and transformed them into 13 shorter episodes for Part One. So there are actually six more 70 minute episodes left for Part Two. <br/><br/>Hopefully it catches a wide audience and we will get to see more of this. 8.8 itÂ´s a bad joke only made possible due to a strong campaign from NetflixÂ´s payed critics.
This show is teen targeted but it doesnÂ´t have to be this childish, full of one dimensional characters, hollywoodian cliches and absolutely predictable.
Great movies came from Spain last two decades, movies that haded new blood and somehow redifined some genres like horror for instance, REC. is a good example , Abre Los Ojos or La Comunidad, even some spanish directors as Amenabar, Almodovar or Alex de la Iglesia are top notch movie makers.
This show break with all the good that was done in recent years in Europe and is just trying to pair with american productions that are way superior like Prison Break.
Three episodes after, three hours of my life that I will not get back, what a let down.
Thumbs down 2 out of 10 I was very excited to watch "Money Heist" after seeing all the great reviews for it. I was very unimpressed. The show is virtually a 70 hour long heist. Parts 3 & 4 are essentially the same story as parts 1 & 2. I was hoping that by the end of part 2 we were done with the hostages & robbery, but no...It just started all over again but robbing a different target. It was painful to watch.<br/><br/>Now, the flawed story-line aside, the writing was crap. The police protocols were HIGHLY unrealistic. No police in any developed nation conduct themselves this way. ie, shooting into a group of hostages in disguises because you "assume" that the one you're aiming at is the bad guy--The entire show is filled with ridiculous policing like this. It was terrible.<br/><br/>I wish I could get my time back. Want a good advice, stop after season 2. The first two seasons were quite good, despite some questionable characters but overall a really good series.<br/><br/>Then season 3, well ok it was not great but the big problem really is the characters. Some are too stupid to be real. They are supposed to be among the best thieves around but really, apart from the professor, a blind pig would execute better. It's so ridiculous that you simply cannot take the series any serious. This series has become a joke, the characters mere clowns straight out of Jersey Shore.
It's really become the professor and his circus. Kind of sad! Please stop with the "this is the greatest show ever" because it's complete trash. Too much B.S. that no criminal would ever be involved in, people who actually like this have zero understanding of how the real world operates, hardened criminals don't behave in this manner, nor do normal adults, they act like grade school children, and there's way too much I think I'm brilliant going on here, the premise is a absolute rip off of Spike Lee's Inside Man, now there's a great heist movie. Last season is like a kid's story....it was my waste of time I can't fathom why people are hyping it. Its plain dumb and boring after 1st episode. Story is full of plotholes and devoid of logic. Who watches this tripe? Seems to be episode after episode of love triangles, people shouting over nothing, ridiculous love stories and an extremely desperate police detective. It's so slow and boring, can't understand the high ratings.. don't get me started on season 4.. all the women are smart and the men/police absolute fools? Terrible representation of Spain's military and police force. Just terrible and the action scenes are all bullets flying around with no reason. Also, too many plot holes that I don't know where to begin.. don't waste your time. We have a great premise here but it is utterly ruined by characters doing dumb things constantly. They train for five months then do everything they were told not to from the get go?
It's one thing if things go wrong, and you expect that, otherwise there's no conflict and no interest in a story. But when it's characters doing dumb things, it gets annoying fast.
Anyway, it's a decent show but the characters will piss you off pretty quick. Okay, I came here to change my rating from 8 to 4. Thanks goes to Netflix. Season 1 & 2 was a single handed masterpiece with a perfect ending. Not to mention the original La Casa De Papel is a mini series of one single season with a perfect binding.
Not untill Netflix came here to bought it's rights & extended the series to make it a garbage.
Season 3 & 4 feels like a cringy drama film with love & awful plots. And they will now premier another season. I mean seriously. It has become Netflix's cashcow series now they'll produce more garbage no matter what. The show was perfect now It's nothing but awfull drama & predictable twist. Poor Sesson 1 ..... ...unnecessary stretched up, could have been end it in 5 episode....ðŸ˜”
5 to 6 episodes are enough to show all things in proper way ðŸ˜“ Watched 2 seasons and it's just average. The ratings are very high. There is not much thrill. It's all about the professor at right place and right time. Professor has planned everything but forgot to dig the tunnel from hangar side even before heist started.<br/><br/>After few episodes it's just about love. Inspector in love with professor. Sub inspector in one way love with inspector. Hostage in love with robbers. Most of the robbers are concerned about their lovers more than money. Action scenes are just like movies. Heavy gunfighting without any death. Inspector comes to know the real identity of professor but then love truimps and professor escapes.<br/><br/>Cast wise Berlin was great. Professor comes next. All others are just average. Tokio, Rio , denver were worst and irritating characters. Where do we start, i am not sure how it is so popular. Definitely interesting story with entertainment, ups and downs, overall awesome concept. But lacks execution by a mile, they wants us to believe that the greatest heist in history of the man kind can be pulled by worst team possible? I am not buying that. Character build is lame and unreal. Definitely one of the most overrated series. But still good watch. Lacasa De Papel was brilliant in its first 2 seasons....but the 3rd and 4th season seems a bit repetitive, unprofessional and a little bit boring. If you are new to watching tv shows they definitely watch this one as its one of the good shows definitely. It will keep you engaged, its pace is good and it has some commercial(and unprofessional) scenes to please the audience. BUT ! if you have already watched many good tv shows like breaking bad,game of thrones, peaky blinders etc. you definitely wont regret NOT watching this. Especially season 4 made me hate this show as they just dragged to get 8 episodes.
So yeah.....this is a good show, but definitely not even close to other brilliant tv shows I would love to give this series 9/10 if the series not stretched like a chewing gum, sweet in the beginning but now no juice remaining. It could be contained in one or maximum two seasons. I'm surprised at Spain police capability ,criminals are going in & out like a shopping mall & they are looking like a spectator, amazing! 1st season was good.. but once they come out of mint, how do they cross city border? How do they go out of country? Where do they hide 1 billion euros, in their underpants?
When tokyo alone escaped they activated operation cage to block all city entry & exit points. They didn't do any such thing to save 1 billion euros & nation pride..
An honest police officer & honest mint employee suddenly support criminals for personal reasons Stop hyping show you morons. There is nothing special about it. Stupid people! This one pretty bucked up. Just stretching it somehow. It's a total BS show and a complete time waste. The plot is too convenient for the robbers, the police is shown super stupid. Common sense is completely ignored to make the plot more dramatic. I don't understand how can it have such a good review at other places. Can't believe everybody is watching this soap opera with guns. It seems the stupid little stories will be going forever. All I can see is some underlining neo Marxism making it appealing to the left wing uprising all over Europe. Watching series 3 and 4 of this show made me cancel my Netflix subscription. They completely ruined what small positives there were. Find this is happening with more and more shows.<br/><br/>We were laughing at the insanely huge plot holes and the un-killable Gandia.<br/><br/>Netflix are the true professors of the world, robbing everyone or their time and money. The acting, filming, special effects, music and the production is excellent.
Season 1 and the start of season 2 was great and very realistic.
Then it was like the pace of the series changed to stretch it and the plot became dumber and dumber.
It became repetitive and some of the actions were so unrealistic that I felt that I was taken for a brainless viewer.
It like everytime the actors had a decision to make, they made the stupidest decision that would extend the series.
It's like Spain had the stupidest police in the world.
I fast forwarded the last 4 episodes of season 2 and then stopped watching because it became too fustrating. Events, details and changes in characters ethics are completely unrealistic I don't get it , I could barely stand season 1. Why most of the people I know are crazy about this totally predictable cliche show. There were exactly 2 moment where I felt like watching an actual heist show. A good plot but writers over complicated it with unwanted, unnecessary and unrealistic twists. Honestly the whole thing should have ended in season 1 and be done with. They stretched it to a point of boring the viewers. After two masterpiece seasons with epic plots that made the show really entertaining<br/><br/>Season 3 and 4 are totally seasons with alot of stretching in the story
And at the end of the day season 4
Ended with nothing new Waste of time.. How can 6 people not hit a person that is 2 meters away. Gandia dodged the bullets like he is in the matrix... Harry Potter is more realistic show than this nonsense. Ty. And i regred wasting this much time... Had been a fan of the show since it came out, Season 01 and Season 02 were downright mind-blowing but please stop.
Season 03 & 04 are totally predictable and the Arturo character is just annoying. I still think by hiring some good writers who can do the trick might improve the show. A lot of unnecessary past scenes that were extremely boring.
Basically a Spanish Salman Khan show.
Please please hire good writers or just end the show already. Wow how things moved up then down the ground.
First 2 season were awesome, the third and fourth are just trash talke with no clue about the storyline.
Should stick with just the first 2 seasons. Season 1 & 2 were awesome 9/10
Season 3 decent 7/10 with superb fantastic finale 9/10 (for that episode only)<br/><br/>Now here Season 4 arrives and became very unrealistic and unnecessarily dragged. Could have been better. 6/10<br/><br/>Overall 7/10<br/><br/>Stop after season 2 I don't know if the director has watched his series ! The idea only is great but the acting and the scenes are quite silly. Despite several let downs and flaws and a couple of generic characters, this show deserves a 10, and that's mostly because of the 3rd season, first two seasons deserve 7-9 stars, but 3rd just put the train back on wheels, and finale of season 3 just let the train run without breaks. It was the moment many would have been waiting for, to turn the Professor really dark. He's always been good and has been able to outsmart everyone despite being good and playing by the rules. Imagine unleashing such guy from all his goodness. Professor is gonna wreak havoc on the system. It's a War now. When I watched the trailer, I thougt it's goona be an interesting TV show. However, it is filled with studpid plots and the characters make tons of unbelivable mistakes. They seemed so professional in the trailer, somwhow they're just some dumb amatuer robbers in the show. If you really want to watch this show, remember turn off your brain when you watch it. Otherwise, you will be as mad as I. Spoilers<br/><br/>Money Heist (English translation) is a well made, well acted, expensive looking production which does a great job of balancing tension, action and character. You get into the heist almost immediately and, unlike many shows, the flashbacks to planning sessions and earlier episodes in the characters' lives rarely overstay their welcome. It's an interesting premise, the bank robbers (in this case Spanish Royal Mint robbers) are the ones who need to buy time in order to complete their heist, and they are the ones deliberately delaying any possible resolution with the police rather than the other way round.<br/><br/>Yes it's not hugely novel. There are clear influences from any number of heist movies, from the senior cop talking to the senior robber of Heat, to the shadowy 'how to infiltrate your enemy' of any number of spy films. And, if you've watched the Spike Lee Joint Inside Man, a part of you must wonder at what point do the creators of Money Heist start paying Russell Gewirtz royalties, not to mention Clive Owen and Denzel Washington.<br/><br/>So what's the problem? Well, there's one major problem: the characters' motivation. But it's an issue so glaring that I gave up on the show half way through season two, feeling like I'd be conned out several hours of my life (it certainly takes it time in certain scenes).<br/><br/>Why is this? Well, from the start, it's suggested that the heist crew are a highly motivated, tightly knit group who have lived, breathed and bonded with each other for months in preparation for the heist. They have total trust in their man on the outside, the Professor, and absolute faith in his plan. The Professor himself is portrayed as an outright genius who has anticipated all of the counter moves by the police, to the point where early episodes of the show make seeming disasters turn into major triumphs for the heist crew. It's very well done and appears totally organic.<br/><br/>Which is why the Professor shooting off in order to cosy up to the lead investigator of the police, the woman running the counter operation, is so inexplicable. What is he doing? Why is he repeatedly exposing himself to the exact person who is best placed to identify him? When a single repeated phrase or unexpected piece of knowledge could reveal him in a heartbeat? And, by all that's holy, what on EARTH is the senior officer in charge of the negotiations doing drinking alcohol in bars, meeting a new man whose surname she doesn't even know, and sleeping with him DURING the heist!? There's no planet where that kind of behaviour is understandable and it causes the escape of multiple hostages and the death of the least characterised character in the whole show (seriously, he barely has five words during his entire involvement).<br/><br/>And this craziness extends to all the other characters. Tokyo is setup as this badass fiery warrior who flies off the handle a lot and seems to relish cutting off her nose to spite her face. Why is she selected for the heist? She has no special skills other than making unforgivable errors and she breaks all the cardinal rules: no personal details, no intimate relationships. Her lover, Rio, oscillates wildly from puppy faced devotion to Tokyo followed by adolescent pique and regularly gives away vital information to the police and the hostage. <br/><br/>Helsinki, the hard, gay, Serbian soldier who should be tough as nails and friendly as cancer is portrayed as a great big teddy bear. Denver, admittedly only present because his dad needs him there, shoots from 'stick it out till the bitter end' to 'we must leave now' whenever the show needs a second crazy robber to mess things up. And Moscow, his father, disappears for episodes at a time, but turns up in order to have a panic attack and get someone shot, before disappearing again. Critics of this piece will say Moscow has a task to do and that's why he's off screen, but that's no excuse to make him disappear for episodes at a time, that's just bad writing.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Nairobi is initially one of the few robbers keeping it together, but starts doing the same moronic actions midway through season two because the writers think 'we need someone to do something really stupid now and we've already pushed the other characters too far.' Which leaves us with Berlin. Inexplicably this rapist psychopath is by far the most sympathetic character throughout, maintaining the same set of principles (faith in the plan balanced by a desire to survive) from the beginning to the point where I stopped watching. And he gets repeatedly blindsided by every other robber, including the Professor, comprehensibly failing to do their job. <br/><br/>And the less said about the opposition (going through various stages of lovesickness, horniness, sexism, aggression, and occasionally stunning insights from a completely irrational basis) the better. Plus don't get me started on why the loudest, most awkward hostage, who has ADMITTED to being part of an escape attempt, continues to be allowed to wonder around unsupervised by the robbers.<br/><br/>All this adds up to one thing: bad writing, which is a real shame in a show with a very strong premise that is put together genuinely well. This is one of those programs in which the writers make characters do things not because the characters would do them, but because the show needs the error in order to generate tension. <br/><br/>My expectation is that, by the conclusion of season two, all the questions about why the Professor has seduced the lead investigator will be answered and everything will be neatly wrapped up, with a few deaths to make things painful for the viewer. But I can't keep watching a show that doesn't respect my intelligence and I genuinely believe you shouldn't either.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favour. Give Money Heist a miss. It promises a lot at the begging, but it seams that as they wanted to make it more complicated they made so many bizarre mistakes and really nonsense scenes, that makes u wanna stop watching it immediately. If you are looking for logic and common sense.... this series is not for you.
Its still a big mystery how they are able to rob the bank. The script is flawed but its nonetheless entertaining and gripping at times.<br/><br/>1. They have trained for 5 months together and yet they cannot even get along without pointing a gun at each other every 10 mins or so. While in the flashbacks, they are one happy family.... during the robbery they are the opposite.<br/><br/>2. Its unknown when and how the Professor falls in love with Inspector Raquel and vice versa after two meetings. While viewers are mystified ... the Professor risks the whole robbery ( his goal in life ) because he has suddenly met the love of his life.<br/><br/>3. Tokyo is unbearable. One does not know if Tokyo's character is supposed to be mentally retarded because she switches from sanity to insanity every 5-10 minutes. There is no explanation for her behaviour given the fact that in the past she has exhibited responsible behaviour and realises the seriousness of the situation.<br/><br/>4. The last episode the police is ready to break into the bank, but Miss Nairobi wants to print more notes !! Berlin says no and what happens after that is something u see throughout the robbery....robbers attacking each other personally. Everyone is moving at snails pace while Rio and Tokya get engaged in a conversation about they will do at the beach etc etc. ( i skipped that... it was painful) This is despite orders from the Professor that the police is ready to break in and they should hurry up.
It all looks very forced.... because there was no reason for Berlin to stay there trying to hold the police back. Everyone couldve escaped comfortably. While the audiences can feel the urgency for them to hurry up.... the robbers themselves are in a world of their own. Even inside the vault Oslo asks Nairobi if they can share a flat...with the police a corridor away from the vault ! And then suddenly.. they switch to normal behaviour and realise they need to get the hell out of there..and Berlin decides to stay back to allow the others to escape. Unnecessary... even though they wanted Berlin to die... they could ve scripted it a lot better.
Its a bank robbery of 940( ? ) million Euros and we have been listening to their dreams of what they will do with the money. They trained for 5 months. This is the moment. This is it. Audiences can feel it.... but sadly the robbers cannot.<br/><br/>And there are other hundreds of flaws in the script.... the characters are not well defined....but its entertaining nonetheless. What an amazing TV series, it literally never stops to surprise! Great plot and plot development and amazing acting. The best I've seen so far, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! I hate watched this over the last two days. I wanted to watch a fast paced action story that wasn't too deep or dramatic, that I didn't need to think too much about. And it starts off with some promise, but by episode 3, I had to skip parts because they were so bad! As it went on I skipped more and more, mainly the terrible back stories and cliche character development scenes.<br/><br/>This should be used as an example of how not to write. Every awful cliche and trope you could think of is contained in this series. It's so over the top, so cheesy, and so very LAME. The worst dialogue ever put down on the page and with so many plot holes. Bad directing, some ok acting, a lot of terrible acting, ok camera work, good soundtrack, but with the worst writing ever. <br/><br/>The lead female character is constantly making the most stupid mistakes that threaten the whole plan and she spreads her stupidity to all the other characters. How am I supposed to relate to her and want her to succeed when all she does is make the stupidest screw ups that threaten to derail the whole story?<br/><br/>There's also the sexism and chauvinistic garbage littered throughout. "You made that mistake because you're on your period." -Actual dialogue! Why are there so many scenes with women in their underwear, sometimes with absolutely no reason why they would be. It's like it was written by a 14 year old boy with no experience with women and all his education from porn. <br/><br/>It's possible that the fact I watched it with over dubbed English is responsible for some of its problems. Maybe the Spanish actual dialogue is not so terrible and cheesy.<br/><br/>It's also possible that the reason this frustrated me so much is because I believed it could have been a very good show. It had promise. I would love to do a rewrite and make it what I think it could have been. I did actually like the ending - but my god was it painful to get to! The first time I groaned and cursed that I found out there was a part 2 and another horrible 9 episodes to get through until I could finish it.<br/><br/>People who rate this 10/10 need their heads examined. It's awful. LAME! ..im not sure why i watched this till the end.. <br/><br/>..maybe because the idea itself isn´t that bad..
..maybe because i didn't expect so much romance..
..maybe because i had already spent to much time not knowing the end when there was more romance and love making going on then developing the story..<br/><br/>
..but seriously..the actors aren't very good, the plot at some point just turns ridiculous (why would captors fall in love with hostages at one point..same question goes out to the police), the ending is more than questionable and theres so much insignificant stuff going an which really makes you sleepy often. i watched part II in 3,5h with a-lot of skipping..<br/><br/>..if you wanna polish up your rusty Spanish - this might me a thing. but dont expect to much..better watch something like fargo.. or WGN´s Outsiders from 2016. but this is not your first choice when it comes to action, crime and mystery - in fact..can someone explain to me "mystery" here? TY. Everything has honestly become so cringe worthy and unrealistic that it's just so embarrassing to watch it anymore. I lose sight of the message they are trying to send with this show anymore, and it's no longer worth watching. Save yourself the time. Let me first start off by saying that the rating on IMDB is very misrepresentative of the quality of this show. La Casa De Papel is an exercise in poor acting and negligent storytelling; favouring flamboyance and clichés above all else. There is a noticeable Fast and Furious influence to the show as the director tries to evoke the same type of camaraderie and attitude amongst the group of outcasts that is the heist operation. It's all for naught however as the characters are shallow due to bad performances and a poor script. Yes, even the acting in the Fast & Furious series can best what is on offer here. <br/><br/>Briefly leaving the acting aside, the plot could have been executed with much more cunning and maturity; alas this is not the show where you will find these traits by any stretch. The director seems to have favoured emotional outcomes in most of the decision-making of the characters that detracts from the realism and does a disservice to the supposed calculated effort that a heist of this magnitude should represent. As the scenes roll on with outcomes that aim to be sensational over something more sensible, you lose respect for the show. <br/><br/>The lack of talent in screenwriting is further emphasized by the narration done by one of the heist operators that comes and goes throughout the episodes. These passages try to put greater emphasis on how impactful a scene should be yet it nearly has the opposite effect. The cooked up drama of an event in the show for which you have a hard time being emotionally invested in is further disparaging when a voice over is describing what is going on in melodramatic fashion. It's heavy handed, period. There is a lack of professionalism and intelligence from the cast which makes it impossible to take La Casa De Papel seriously. The series starts off well. The idea and the details in the beginning are well worth watching. Sadly, the creators only care for the HiFi and don't give a crap about the LoFi. Quickly the the characters become stereotypes from a Venezuelan telenovéla and the story evolves into something that more and more resembles a soap opera much like "mi gorda bella". At the end, I have to say I'd be scared as sh** if I lived in a country where during the biggest heist in modern history, the police was so reluctant to do their job that they felt the urge to go on a romantic date with a stranger and waste time and energy on lover's quarrels and jealous outbreaks. The fact that the robbers would be equally as disorganised and incompetent wouldn't worry me less. All of the people involved seem to be utterly incapable of prioritising, which is strange, seeing as they've spent weeks preparing for the heist...
Bottom line to the moral seems to be: Real men are violent and know how to throw a punch. Women are emotional and irrational. Abortion is wrong.
..or maybe this is just the case in Spain... Yaeh ok, the idea was so nice, the thieves that steal from the money maker, nice. But, the characters were so poor and quite always they react impulsively, like Tokyo. And u will get to point that you are going to hate this chooses and tha unreal ones too. The end is a bit hasty, with no explanation and with a big cliche, like wow. There are too many scenes useless, with no point to be watched, just to "make this episode longer" and this make the watcher to skip them. Also there is a lack of plot, between the professor and Berlin, are they brothers or what? And is Berlin the kid who felt so bad when he was young? Probably we Weill never know. I ended this series becouse of the character of Berlin and the professor, they are the highlight part. The inspector character is like too round at the end, in just 5 minute she just changed all her ideas, let her daughter and went away. So realistic choices. I'm not going to advise this series to someone, too banal and in my opinion a bit bad, acting was good. Halfwas season two, I think the series is predictable and the story is too long. It feels like they could have done two seasons in one easily. Netflix's recommendation algorithms clearly need some work if they think this was a 98% match. The initial premise is interesting but became an interminable endless series of:<br/><br/> - ever widening plot holes and layers of implausibility - some of which have been mentioned in other reviews. Will I recover from a gunshot wound as quickly as some of the characters here? Where do all the pizzas and food come from? Is the Mint cafeteria still operating during the heist? Why is the lead investigator running around doing her own thing while the whole world's media watches the siege?
 - the repeated use of the Long Arm of Coincidence to move the plot along
 - levels of incompetence among the lead investigator, Spanish police and intelligence services which make the Keystone Cops look like a highly trained SWAT team
 - cut-out characters whom it is impossible identify with, let alone like.<br/><br/>I hate-watched to the end to drink a shot of vodka each time another plot hole or implausibility came up, but ran out of alcohol long before this unnecessarily long series came to an end. Such a shame that the Spanish can cliche drama as badly as the Americans. This is not a good show by any stretch of the imagination. Plot-holes, continuity errors, disregard for veracity (I mean, the Serbian mercenaries and the assault-squad police actors grab the weapons incorrectly, and that's just 1 small thing).<br/><br/>Browsing through comments, you can find many dupes, even the same comment 5 times: "masterpiece", "as good as breaking bad". These are certainly bots.<br/><br/>I told my wife, this series is so poorly written and directed, that it's like they had in mind an audience that doesn't question anything and is content by being spoon-fed cliches and ridiculous mini-cliffhangers in each episode, you know, like our moms and aunts, a non-critical audience that doesn't know any better.<br/><br/>This is truly a waste of time and the high ratings are evidently the result of tampering, DO NOT BELIEVE ANY RATING ABOVE 5 STARS. This is one of the most overrated shows I have ever seen. Full of non sense, the Spanish security authorities should stop this series because it visualizes them as some idiots. Imagine the investigation of this kind of robbery is led by a lady how is the sexually hungry and can sleep with someone she just met three days ago. A very week woman and awkward man (Angel) next to her are investigating the robbery of the place printing Euros!!!. Some co-incidents are fabricated to prolong the serious and continues the scenes. Overall, very awkward piece of work. At first it seemed to me that the series had a very coassist idea, each hero has his own character and story. But already in the third series there were first doubts about the competence of the screenwriters of this show. I have not seen such stupid plot twists and such a number of love lines in any series about robberies. How this series got such a high mark remains a mystery to me. I don't understand the high ratings on this show,plot is a mess! Lacasa de papel is one of the greatest TV shows of all time.. awesoe acting and genius writing..
Elprofessor character is one of the best characters I've seen Not sure how this got such a great review! Lot of plot holes. The Spanish police is portrayed as a very incompetent.( The snipers especially) I won't be happy at all to see such a series if I was a Spaniard! I know many will think why the 1/10 rating but i just feel this show does not deserve the rating of 8.6/10 not at all. I watched both season's,it is a good show but no more. Its predictable enough and it does not even seem real in many cases(example. The Cop Shootout ,all that shooting all that bullets and only 1 got hurt after a lot of time, its like the cops random shooted) In other words there is no element of violence in a armed heist,the main actors are not even afraid of a gun pointing in their head, clearly dont get me wrong this show is good but not even close to shows like Vikings,Breaking Bad,Game of Thrones,The last kingdom , the show deserves a rating below 7.9/10 its a shame that it surpasses Vikings rating, I just feel the target audience for this show is young aged that give those ratings.
Rating for Casa de papel 7/10
Rating for the marketing team 8.6/10
Thats the truth.<br/><br/>And if you dont agree with me and you think this show really deserves that rating i got one question for you.<br/><br/>Is your agony for the next season the same with game of thrones and Vikings new season's? Cringey, plot holes, lazy writting, plot convenience, deus ex machina, too unrealistic, the main girl is boring and irrelevant, too much high school drama. Do not watch this, you'll waste your time. So, I started watching this show, admittedly, because of the hype.. And it just made me come to terms with the fact that just because a show has a lot of hype surrounding it, doesn't mean it's anything special. Money Heist is nothing special. I have seen countless films and shows relating to heists, and I admit that this show brings a bit of unique aspects here and there to it, but in reality it is just not as captivating to me.<br/><br/>To me the most annoying thing about it, is the script. I'm sure it sounds way better in Spanish than it does in English, but if you don't understand Spanish, you're stuck with a very simple, 7th Grade-Level, uninteresting script. I know I could have watched it with subtitles and in Spanish, but I cannot completely follow the flow of the series if I am focusing on subtitles. It just loses the essence of the show that way, I feel. I think the translation could have been done much better for viewers who don't speak Spanish.<br/><br/>The police have to be the dumbest police ever at this point, I mean... The professor, although seemingly "Genius" isn't that Genius and is making mistakes all over the place. None of them really are. And I think portraying the show to be so Special and then watching.. it's just a totally different series than what I thought I would be watching.<br/><br/>I am nearing the end of the first season and am waiting for it to surprise me.... It just seems like a rip off of The Inside Man till now... There are a lot of coincidences, mostly everything is going as the professor want or expect Creator Alex Pina's last one results to be a splendid series with great cast and manificently made.

My first points that I don't enjoy movies/ shows that are not consistent within their own universe. For example we have this professor who is supposed to be brilliant but obviously makes irrational/ stupid decisions. But there are many examples of such occurrences from different characters. Secondly I don't find the plot so original. They borrowed ideas from a few movies/ series and they put them together. I gave it a 1 because I find the 8.7 irrationally high. I can only assume that these positive reviews have been paid for, or are from people who have seen a very limited amount of shows! This is average, at best. To give my reasons:<br/><br/>The overacting is incredible; from people visibly shaking to show that they are under stress, to manic grins and laughter at totally unamusing jokes. <br/><br/>For a bunch of "professionals", the characters constantly make ridiculous, stupid decisions. I mean laugh out loud stupidity.<br/><br/>The plot is paper thin after an intriguing start, and still managed to slow down to walking pace in the middle. <br/><br/>There is misogyny and homophobia throughout. <br/><br/>The plot holes are to numerous to mention.<br/><br/>Having said that, I did watch it all, sometimes in disbelief, and mainly because my OCD won't let me stop half way. What a shame that a decent idea and set up could be wasted like this. How on earth people can make this a highly rated show I will never know. It is an insult to all the quality shows out there that could be enjoyed! Overrated, the most stupid plot twist ever, how can the director miss these crazy major details. and how can these actors pass through the filters of the auditions. How come spain is empty of good actors. I couldn't stand watching each episode without hitting the wall because how was stupid I am to listen to the one who advised me to watch this.<br/><br/>The only reason that I'm giving it two stars instead of one, is that I liked the soundtrack at the credit of each episode. Even the only good think they made it 20 seconds only.<br/><br/>DO NOT WATCH THIS SERIES AND STOP YOURSELF BEFORE MAKING A BIG MISTAKE The holes in the scenario are SO many! There are things so unbelievable that it is obvious that are occuring just because the writers wanted to reach a predicament, they make no sense! First of all, the thieves leave the hostages alone all the time! Hostages try to help themselves escape in the most ridiculous ways, and no one hears them?? And all the while people are having sex with each other in there? And all the while the Police chick has time to go out on a date???<br/><br/>So very flawed it is hard to watch. Do yourself a favor and watch this series. Mindblowing, speechless, amazing. Omg, within 48 hours, everyone found true love, love of life, boyfriend/girlfriend, everyone has sex with someone. within 72 hours, meet the parent. within 2 days, the detective has been to cafe 3 times, gone back home 4 times,  diss'ed colleagues 6 times. the timeline is so messed up to a point it turns very funny. Great show and I have to admit that I dislike Tokyo soo much! Such a stupid thoughtless little pathetic woman! As professor rightly said in 7th episode of season 4.
Please keep your sense aside. That's the whole concept of money heist. They have been digging tunnels again all around. Very hard to believe how can someone like this kinda web series. Overall.. it just terrible.<br/><br/>they start with a great concept & a very promising story.
then it starts going downhill... and it never stops, going down hil...<br/><br/>toooo many flaws in the storyline... too many loopholes... to many love stories between people.<br/><br/>I mean are you there to rob and make money OR are you here to make love stories and relationships? Let's start with the initial premise: occupying the mint, printing up 2.4 billion in 50-Euro notes, and stealing them. That many notes would weigh 43,200 Kg and occupy a minimum of 29 standard CEN-pallets (each stacked a ridiculous 2.7 meters high), which is five more than will fit in a 40-ft container. The narration tells us they printed 200 million in the first 8 hours, so the whole lot would take 96 hours (4 days), and then it all has to be cut, stacked, wrapped and loaded. So they have to continue their occupation for, say, all together 7 days without the police taking the standard step of CUTTING OFF THE POWER. Then they have to get all that bulk removed, taken to another location, and then what are they going to do with it? Divide it amongst them? Each of them then has at least two pallets, 3,000 Kg, of bulk to carry away?<br/><br/>This is like some late-night stoner idea that nobody with any sense ever intervened in. Are these people from the 1950's? I mean, who steals paper money, anymore? How do they think they'll ever use it? Bank notes have serial numbers, and the word will go out immediately. No bank anywhere will ever accept them in deposit. They cannot be laundered. Anyone with a layman's common sense sees immediately that the whole premise is absurd. It is sweet irony indeed that the author of such a laughably impracticable idea be known as "The Professor."<br/><br/>Then there's the stilted, hackneyed dialogue, the clumsy character development, the lazy action sequences. And this is all in the first three episodes. I don't understand my fellow reviewers complaining they "wasted their time" on three seasons of this. I'm ending this agony now. First season was okay.. then they started to play some communism music etc.. beside it's not even realistic like how can Spanish police be so dumb and not be able to arrest 8 hippies I never reviewed a movie or a tv show before, but since this is being the 'TV Show" nowadays and the success it is getting from critics and fans. I have never seen a serie which is that over hyped before. And the logic will question the intelligence of many as well as the storyline. I still dont get how this is making a buzz. Music is inadequate, acting very average and the plot seems like a bunch of teenagers who came up with it. Too much credits for that genre. I give 4 stars for the shots as they well quite well done. But other than that, stick to Ozark, trust me on that one. Excellent first plot and good actor performances in season 1-2 built great expectations for season 3-4, but the series ended up as an average Hollywood production filled with action scenes, violence, intrigues and relationship problems. Season 1: awesome
Season 2: cool
Season 3: omg the tension is killing me
Season 4: ...bad,slow,rediculous. Heard good reviews about season 1-2 and indeed it's good. Berlin acted very well.<br/><br/>Season 3-4 too unrealistic and absolutely trash. Do not waste your time..you've been warned. This series is well made in the sense that it has engaging plot and some interesting characters. However, the way they've portrayed the intelligence and the police force is absolutely ridiculous. They've been dumb-ed down massively just to give the "professor" a winning edge. Then Inspector Raquel must be the dumbest officer ever to "fall in love" with someone in 5 days in the middle of a hostage situation. Not only that, she then abandons her police force and side with the criminals. REALLY?!!!! I kept thinking that there's going to be a big twist in the end where the police are going to win but it was absolutely ridiculous. Although the 1 and 2 season was perfect , and season it was ok after Tokyo's escape the season 4 is so needless. Season 4 has so many flashbacks that we had to see them at season 3. I agree the other reviews that is look like an soap opera , why they are all going to be couples in this serie? I think if you see only the episodes 7-8 of the season 4 its ok because at the previous episodes they are doing nothing. 4th Season wasn't as Everyone expected
I'm very disappointed 👎🏻 This show was great when season 2 ended. Now its a stretch. On the basis of first 2 seasons it held 10/10 from my side but season 4 is absolutely disappointing. Too much of the stupidity, plot holes, most of the things doesn't make sense at all. It should have ended at season 2. But the producers and Netflix wants to make more money. Season 3 and others are more like fantasy or fairytale kind of story. Time wasting. 5/10 too much action and weak conversations.
And you feel they writers write what fans want. Watched season 1 and 2, which is a finished unit. I do not plan to watch further.<br/><br/>First, the good stuff: the basic idea is great as well as some of the twists. Also, characters were well developed and consistent. But...<br/><br/>More often than not plot development is poor as it is too far from approximately solid ground. Some actions taken by characters are outright stupid or unnatural to the situation and would never happen to experienced robbers that were chosen and trained for half a year. Same goes for the police officers side.
Sometimes characters do actions that do not make any sense, only to fulfill the criteria that is required to drive the plot further to the desired direction (e.g. Denver's real gun exposure makes no sense).
Also Professor's ideas require series of coincides to happen. Not one or two events, but series of them.<br/><br/>Of course, I get that some of mentioned is necessary to make things interesting, but in this series, it is used to the extent where it becomes untasty. Most of the situations just do not hold the water.
Also, 3 days into the heist there are already so many romantic relationships going on, it is disgusting.<br/><br/>Be warned that the series are loaded with cliffhangers, so often you can't help yourself to watch another (mediocre) episode. For this reason, I don't even recommend you to start with it. Trust me, if your brain is not numb, you can't appreciate these series.<br/><br/>Also, I have to mention that overall I've skipped 4 (shorter Netflix) episodes (carefully chosen by description) and never had a feeling that I've missed something out. What if Die Hard delved into the personal lives of each of Hans Gruber's henchmen? And what if those henchmen were idiots who couldn't handle their emotions in the middle of a complex crime? Why did the Professor hire these clowns? Tokyo should have been executed by Berlin after her first of many dangerous mistakes.
This show has a great story but the characters do not react to events like normal people. Plus the English subtitles are straight from Google Translate, really clumsy. Who do you think will win? Brazil.
Who do you want to win? Cameroon.
The Brazilian players are not very likeable.
The players from Cameroon are not the brightest, but atleast nicer than the Brazilians.
Oh, and the amount of luck for Brazil is reaching a 10 on the scale of laughability.
Is a game like that fun the watch? No. I would advise you to watch a more fun game. I think this tvseries is overrated. It's gets boring after initial 6th episode itself. The concept is great but the creators messed it up. If u can bare the first season second season is somehow beter. But for that one has to surpass the 1st season. Once thwy get inside to rob, it looks like they are on a vacation. I personally think this show would have made better with the great script it already has git, but it didn't get executed well. Disinteresting, shoddily written, mild sexist, overrated.<br/><br/>Started this on Netflix because my friends told me it's a great watch and the IMDB rating were great too. Unfortunately, it is darn boring. I might have a different taste when it comes to the heist genre. I expect the thieves to be smarter people who can outwit the police but what we see here is a bunch of people making stupid errors one after the other. Is to Buy Time. And boy, does this series do it. Season One crawls along, and instead of wrapping up everything in a nice little bow by Episode 13, nah, fooled you, we're gonna continue on, and on, and on. So many Suspension of Doubt in the story-- like the Professor somehow hooking up with Raquel, lead investigator on the case. Or Denver hooking up with Monica-- as if Stockholm Syndrome pops up in a few days, esp. after the victim has been shot in the leg, after learning she is pregnant by the wimping min director who first says he has no intention of leaving his wife and three kids, only to suddenly say, yeah, Monica, you're the one for me.
If this had wrapped up after one season, I would have written it off and said, okay, some good, some bad, but not worth watching the remaining two Seasons.
Not sure why it is rated so highly. The script and plot lines should have been edited with a weed hacker.
This is like The Never Ending Story, it just keeps going on, and on, and on...Should have ended after about ten episodes.
And brought to you be Estrella Damm beer...with product placement everywhere! Great Spanish series. Unfortunately a streaming service ordered a 3rd and 4th season. Watchable because big budget makes it possible. This was the first Spanish show I was watching and initially i got really hooked to it. 
What you expect from a heist show is the robbers showing a great amount of intelligence and planning to outwit the cops. Yes, there was a lot of planning involved and the main man behind it "The Professor" was a likeable character but slowly you start realizing that the cops and the intelligence team handling the operation have been shown so incompetent. The head of the cops team, Raquel Murillo is one of the lead cast in this show. But a few of her actions in the show might leave one surprised as to how foolish and ineffective the cops are. You start to wonder whether the heist is being successful because of the intellect of the con team or rather due to unprofessionalism of the cops.
Season 1 is still watchable but I thought that Season 2 was disastrous. Things that were happening defied logic and by the later half of the second season, the show was literally dragging. There are many loopholes in the logic and methods adapted by the police to stop the heist. 
I cant recall having watched any other show in this genre (except from the movie Oceans Eleven which i liked) but I would suggest giving this TV series a miss. I just finished binging both seasons, parts 1-4, and wow did this show hook me in right at the first episode.<br/><br/>Novice actors were cast and their performances were outstanding, falling sympathetic to each ones skills, flaws and unique personalities.<br/><br/>Directing was excellent, as was the cinematography. The story concept was brilliant, and played out with non-stop tension and suspense, and all the timelines and flashbacks were executed perfectly. Aside from some plot an technical issues, with a few pacing problems in some of the episodes - especially season 2, not a minute was wasted, and I found myself forgetting to breathe with the constant drama each episode offered.<br/><br/>Some people thought season 2 was bad, but it had its plus an minuses compared to the first season, which was stellar. The difference is more character development and dynamics, which I enjoyed, but I do agree about some of the long dragged out episodes, ridiculous and illogical action scenes, and overdone drama. However, season 3 episode 8 is one of the best episodes I've ever seen, of any show, or for that matter movie. It needs to win every award possible. I also was not a fan of the final episode of the second season. It didn't have a resolution like the first season, but instead, was left with many cliffhangers and illogical plot twists. They needed to have one or two more episodes to wrap up and give its viewers closure, instead of opening up a new season in the same heist. That was just dumb.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it's the best international tv series I've seen, and in my top five of all time tv shows - right up there with Breaking Bad and Ozark. It's a well deserved 9.5 rounded up to 10/10 from me. Can't wait for part 5, and I hope it's sooner than later to relieve my frustration and anger how they closed out the last season. To see more of my 900+ reviews and 1000+ ratings, click on my username. When I was a child, the first books of Harry Potter were published; I remember enjoying the first book, but by the time I read the fourth book, the story had faded away into lifelessness. Not only had the script already been stretched too far, the writer, hungry for money and popularity, depraved herself of moral standards and produced 3 more toilet paper books. These have faded away forever from the memories of our civilisation and the characters now burn in the timeless incarceration of literary hell. This is the story of La Casa de Papel. The concept is nice. The plot gets well established during the first episodes with planning, character introduction and rules.<br/><br/>My main issue is the bad writing overall. Meaning that the execution of the plot is a mess. The characters force themselves into the silliest situations. Usually this can be ignored, but it happens too often.
The expectations I had got ripped after watching ep 4. and the serie went onto more important things like, pregnancy, divorce, strong women, evil men etc. You know, Netflix enforcing their political view. Brilliant show - brilliant story - brilliant acting - i would say one of the very few shows that hooks you up like nothing. Let's hope the upcoming seasons are even better. Great story, directing and fantastic acting. You cannot stop watching! Despite some of the more ridiculous contrivances, I appreciate how suspenseful and entertaining this series can be, and being able to keep that up through the series as well as La Casa de Papel is a great feat. Even better, they managed to wrap it all up with a satisfying ending that... what... there is gonna be a series 3?<br/><br/>Viewed in Spanish language with subtitles. Like watching a Chess game playing by 2 Grand Masters. Every move is calculated in advance. Every episode is nerve breaking. Climax episodes are terrifically screenplayed. I have to admit that after reading the description of this show, I didn't expect myself to get so immersed and feel so emotional while watching it. I though it would be one more of those simple yet fun heist movies without much more involved than the heist itself.<br/><br/>However, while watching it you get to understand that this show is more than just a money heist. It becomes an eye-opener about the way our world is run by capitalism and economics. It certainly has a deeper meaning and the makers of this show have found a great way of delivering it to us.<br/><br/>There is not much to say about it. Even the actors where great and their acting was so believable that makes me wonder why many of them don't have a career in Hollywood...<br/><br/>This show is smart, it delivers great messages, it has great tempo leaving you no time to get bored or anything and you will absolutely feel thankful for watching it!<br/><br/>Excuse me for any grammar mistakes, English is not my native language.<br/><br/>O bella, ciao! bella, ciao! bella, ciao, ciao, ciao!... I loved it , it is fun and you just want to know what is going to happen in the next episode
I read some of the reviews, maybe it has a few flaws not perfect, but it is fun to watch. I truly enjoyed it
Also I do not understand why some persons think that the good reviews are paid by netflix, every one of my friends who saw this show liked it , so it must be kinda the majority of the opinions As most of the reviewers I didn't knew exactly what all the fuss was about this series receiving such high praises until I decided to watch it and my oh my... It really is that good! Perfect Score, perfect script, great character development, AMAZING actors, thrilling plot-twists, great photography. <br/><br/>Everything is there! You will laugh and cry, you will feel the show in your gut and love it! Do yourself a favor: Stop reading reviews and start watching! Just watch it in SPANISH and not dubbed, you will thank me later! Bella Ciao Berlin, Professor and all the cast and crew for this incredible show! What a ride! Started watching it as everyone else was talking about the show and how fabulous it is, the characters aren't convincing, the story itself is not well-written, the acting can be ridiculous sometimes, many actors have been really heavy on me and so dumb so that I had to skip many scenes only not to get bothered by their appearances, especially the detective, some actors are good, Berlin for example.
overall, I didn't complete it as I found it to be a waste of time, maybe you can do a movie with that story, but a series is too much for it, repeated contents and gaps everywhere, didn't convince me, HIGHLY overrated I wanted to like this so much. I crave for intelligent heist triller for a very, very long time and just the 1st few reviews and the score and i was hooked. To my surprise this is nothing more ,but intelligent heist WANNABE. Plot is flawed on so many levels , the actions and the choices our characters made one after another along with the insultingly dumb conversations at the most unpropriate times just made it unwatchable for me. I tried , i tried really hard to not pay much attention to small things just for the sake of the general entertainment ,but u couldnt do it and im sorry but i feel like i have to be drunk to stop noticing so many things. If you like t owatch smart movies with twists and really complicated intriguing plots do yourself a favour and skip it cause it will hurt your intellect! If like i could assume from some of the reviews u are nott much into this and i never seen anything good and similar plot wise .. u might try it but then again u only need to watch and listen carefuly and if u possess half the intelligence of a monkey u wont be entertained at all. I am sorry for my review but someone had to say the truth. AND NO it is not subjective , what is DUMB and unbelievable is DUMB and unbelievable sorry. After getting so many recommendation from web and social media, I started to watch the series 'Money Heist'. From the very beginning I was asking myself the sam questions over and over again, 'does this series worth watching?'. Not only the story has several loopholes and poorly constructed, but also the acting from the cast was very very disappointing.<br/><br/>Sometimes it happens that you will find something good even in an average type of series. However, I was unable to find any good quality in this series. Yes, I have completed watching the first series. You may be wondering if I did not like the series why did I finish the first part. It took me about two months to complete the first 13 episodes. It's the complete opposite of 'binge'.<br/><br/>As I don't know Spanish, I watched the series with English subtitle first. The subtitles are very poor. Dialogues are very lame and shallow. If you are a serious viewer of quality, please don't watch it. Too many political correctness clichÃ©s (strong wamam, meanies bullies etc ...), a Netflix show bringing its political agenda to Spain.
Anyway the real problem is that the show could be great but it is heavy flawed and get dumber every passing episode. It is a problem because the plot has a real huge potential.
Basically the plot is based on the very elaborated plan of a mastermind (the professor) to rob a bank... great.... but he choses the worst people for the job (psychopath, hysteric girls etc ...). Eventually it doesn't make any sense. If you're looking for a show that has the best and worst elements of Days of our Lives, The Room and Inside man, then you've come to the right place<br/><br/>After about ten episodes in season 1, I really dont know what is happening.
The plot is all over the place and side plots pop up every 15 minutes, and dont seem to lead anywhere and are buried again. The character development is so odd and illogical and sometimes you feel you've missed 2-3 episodes. Without spoiling anything here are a few examples. Someone is drunkdialing a colleague about how much they love them and refer to a past affair, and the next day, it never happened.
Suddenly the logical somewhat likeble guy is turned to be the bad guy and back again to a good guy (?) And then everything is forgotten. The intellegence officer and the negotiator start out with a pissing contest and you are lead to believe that there is stuff thats "above the negotiator paygrade" that are happening. And then theres is nothing happening and everything is A okay.
The group of robbers are first presented as a solid, well drilled, best of the best the country has to offer and all of them have bags of experience from past jobs.
After 10 episodes however..
These are the most unprofessional, no discipline, unloyal, reckless, childish robbers you will ever see and how they ever completed a past job is beyond me. I wouldnt trust them stealing a nickle from my blind and deaf grandmom.<br/><br/>The acting is mediocre at best and I cant really point anyone out that is above that.<br/><br/>Im going out on a limb here and guess that this show is aimed at spanish talking housewives in the age of 50-70 years that probably have all of DAYS recorded on VHS and are looking to simething similar.<br/><br/>Im really surprised the rating this show has (currently 8.6). It has mediocre written all over and therefore no higher than a 5/10 from me.
Unless the writers are some out of this world geniuses andd somehow weave all the plots together in a season finale.<br/><br/>cult status potentiale though I just don't get how this series got good reviews -- it is beyond stupid and every character unsympathetic, the worst of all of them being El Professor, alias Mr. Smarty-Pants -- supposedly always ahead one step -- not very hard to do with the dumbies he has to contend with. Close behind him in obnoxiousness and cluelessness is Ms Inspector who succumbs to Professor's charms, such as they are and frankly I don't see them at all - from his goofy glasses to his bad body to his Clark Kent alter ego, he is Yeccch. Honestly I was routing for his demise or capture at every turn, knowing that just wasn't in the cards as presumably we are supposed to like him. And what is it with his crocodile tears every time one of his gang dies --boo hoo we see the tears coursing down his face and 3 seconds later he is smiling, happy as can be over another scam he has perpetrated over the bunch of Keystone Kops he is up against. All of them seem to get over the death of their compadres pretty quick including the son of the father-son duo, can't remember his name.3 seconds after his beloved papa dies, he is kissing his girlfriend, the bank secretary and smiling at getting out. The whole crowd, kidnappers, hostages and cops -- bad news all of them, and may I say -- never saw any of them take a shower during the whole series yet they fornicate at will, clothes on or off -- take your pick. How could professor made a robbery with some noob and unstable people except berlin.All the problem occurs by rio and Tokyo's false love.whole series was gone downhill by these couples.please remove rio and Tokyo character on next season it would be better. I'm not really big on series, but once I started watching Money Heist I couldn't stop watching. The plot is captivating, intense, emotional, it involves all your senses and it's highly unpredictable. It's a thoroughly thought out series.
The characters are so amazing, they played their parts so well that at each point you feel so immersed like you're there with them. The professor is a genius. Berlin is a very fantastic guy, focused and principled, one of my best characters only second to the professor. Nairobi, oh my Nairobi. I can equally liken her to Berlin because she's focused on the job.<br/><br/>If you've not watched Money Heist, I don't know what to say to you honestly.<br/><br/>One of the best series I've seen. Which is my problem.<br/><br/>This show is meant to be for a very broad audience. If you watch it with an analytical mind (having some basic understanding about the world history and culture helps) you will go crazy.<br/><br/>There is so many cliches, (from phrases, to historical events, music, etc), its just insulting at some point. Every cliche you can think of, cliche phrase, cliche term was used in this show. You will notice those.<br/><br/>But then again, some normal behavior is altered to fit the story and to fit the events. There are so many different, completely unnatural reactions in the movie, that would absolutely never be possible in real life.<br/><br/>Police in the show, represented somewhat negatively, are just plain stupid and naive. I dont see any other reason to make the decisions that theyve done.<br/><br/>And this is throughout the whole show. In every episode, i found 10-20 things that annoyed the living hell out of me, frustrated me, and just plainly made me angry for spending time for watching it.<br/><br/>If you do watch it, do not overly think or go into analysis "why, how, what". Just watch, and you might enjoy the audio/video production value. Which is the only reason i wont give it 1/10. It looks modern. I would rate the first 2 seasons 8/10 and season 3-4 2/10 the ruined a beautiful show with the boring drama and flashbacks. Soap opera with forced storylines that make no sense at all, plot holes bigger than craters on the Moon and characters that are just doing whatever they want in a show pretending to be smart. Most unrealistic character for me after seeing just the few episodes would be that police negotiator. What were the writers thinking? She would be replaced after the first day of that mess... OverHype.... Foolish & Melodramatic.....
too many Flaws......streched..... This has to be one of the most overhyed show I've ever watched. There has to be some reason behind the hype, After watching 3 seasons of this. I can say there isn't any. One hiest is dragged on for 2 seasons. It's predictable in every way. A robbery which could have been shown in 2 episodes or so was dragged for 20+ hours.
Please don't waste your time on this. There are plenty of shows our there that are actually worth the time.
You aren't missing out on anything. If you ask me, it's better if you miss this hype train. Ridiculous, unbelievable, boring ! Who cares of what happens to those thugs ? After 10 minutes, I was hoping they would all be killed. Stupid nonsense and waste of time. No interest at all. I really wonder why so many people find that contemptible story about contemptible characters.... Better shows didn't have a 8.5 notes some are just spamming that 10/10 rating for no reason.
First and second seasons were quite good i'd give them 8/10, third season felt like wasn't needed and the same thing happened over again it's netflix wanted to invest in this show so bad so they will make profits off it i'd give it 5/10 and finally the season 4 is mediocre literally 8 episodes could be all resumed in 2 episodes at maximum 2/10 So i will be giving this show 5/10 or 6/10 at maximum.
So Overrated having notes like 8.5/10 There are a few options why this garbage of a series is rated this high (low/no standards, kids as audience, bought reviews) - and I'm not saying that ratings are indicative of the production's quality, however "quality" may be defined.<br/><br/>In short: this series is laughably bad. Why? The whole acting, story etc. is so ridiculous I wondered a few times if Spanish audiences have a totally different movie language than other Western countries.<br/><br/>For example, there is this bunch of school kids visiting the place to be robbed by a group of gangsters. A girl and a boy from that class exchange a few initial whatsapp messages and within minutes they hold hands and seconds later they kiss! Another few minutes and they make out on the toilet!! wtf???
Same thing with a guy and a woman from the gangster group. They look at each other during their first briefing, seated like a bunch of school kids with the "professor" in the front. Later that day, the guy appears at the room of the chick, she initially sends him away to only literally crash with him into the bed. And that's just the way sexual nonsense in the first episode.<br/><br/>It goes on and on with cringe worthy dialogues and plots. The reason why the first of the robber's gets identified is because that guy left one of the school girls (then hostage) take a video to send it to her family. He leaves her with the phone in front of her to argue with a female robber (the one he hopped into the bed with), of course that chick uses the phone anyways - and of course she doesn't hide it because heavily armed criminals can't be dangerous. And so on and so on... First three episodes had me interested. Then I began growing tired of the flashbacks and character development. By the end of Part 1 after FF through much of it, I watched a few episodes of Part 2 and once again couldn't take the slow pace, so right to the last 40 minutes I went. What an ending! I must tell others - do not waste your time. Casa de papel is the most tedious boring series I have seen so far. The story rattles on all sides, the dialogues are uninteresting and unnecessary and the actor talent just isn't there. It is therefore a mystery to me why the story of Casa de papel should be spread over 4 seasons. Deserves no more than 4 stars. Do not miss Money Heist Season 4 and binge-watch it before people start sharing spoilers out on social media. Trust me; you do not want to miss out on the madness of this heist drama. This season ended in such a cliffhanger that you'll feel restless thinking about the waiting time for its next season! So, get ready for a smashing season 5 because this is not just a heist anymore, it's a war and won't end anytime soon! Magnifique! In Money Heist there is action, some twists unbelievable and some fleeting romance ridiculous. But that is not credible, the character, the bounce and the decision takes : everything is false, everything seem illogical. I find it Money Heist mostly at the end.I find that a series too overpriced. In Money Heist there is action, some twists unbelievable and some fleeting romance ridiculous. But that is not credible the character, the bounce and the decision takes : everything is false, everything seem illogical. I find it annoying. There's a lot of inconsistency in Money Heist mostly at the end. I find that a series too overpriced. The netflix autoplay trailer SPOILED the 1st season! Come on Netflix. The show is trying hard to be realistic although it is not at all .. overdrama about every situation .. you feel like episodes are empty nothing new . Plot holes everywhere . Unnesecerry conversations .
Idea is new and acting is not bad .... nothing to be special .
P.s : Its like an indian movie .
Amazed of this high score . Thanks creator. i have n't watch this type of series my 20 years whole life. what a acting, what a concept. thanks all of cast , thanks "THE PROFESSOR" Sergio or Salva.
I will watch it again. SPOILER: Season 1 is simply great. Why?<br/><br/>Great story.
Great acting (by most)
Great characters
Great pace <br/><br/>There are some flaws here and there, true. But this is something one should watch with the mind switched off and see it as an adventure. If you look for the illogical and try to analyse the 'plan' one may as well skip this show. <br/><br/>Example: The tunnel being build 5 years before, toward a federal building. Complete BS of course. But really, who cares? <br/><br/>Just lay back and enjoy this GREAT ride.... I think it's Really Awesome in every angle. All of actors were very professional & perfect. I see a lot of negative critics here on IMDb. On the opposite side, everyone I encountered in real life told me to start watching this series.
I just finished season 2 and I regret that I didn't started watching it earlier. I am not used to watching series (I watch mostly movies) but I can say for sure that when it ended it left me fulfilled and with a big smile in my face. I want, of course , to see the 3rd season when it releases.
My advice? Stop overthinking a series/movie. All have they plot holes or their letdowns from time to time. Every single person thinks and thinks again the plot holes and the thing that went wrong. If professor had it all thought perfectly then the show would be boring and with no thrills... just a perfect heist...
No one forces you to see it yet a lot of people didn't like it and continued till the end of all episodes... for what? Just to write a negative comment? If I don't like a series or a movie I turn it off.. no watch it relentlessly till it ends, just to say bad things for it... The show starts with an interesting plot but then I found it unbearable to watch even after the 2-3 episode.
These characters were chosen for this mission because they were good at what they do and that the whole plan should go swiftly. In addition they prepared for months for this heist. However nearly all decisions are made stupidly and for no good reason. How come there is an affair for months among these 'clever' people, staying in the same house all together. 
Weren't they expecting some reaction from the hostages? Why try to execute the woman immediately after the incident and why didn't Berlin gave the mission to one of the muscle boys and started a family drama? (Weren't Berlin the one with good social skills.) And how can you even beat one of your own 'gang' members after a mistake; aren't they all supposed to be equals? <br/><br/>The gang could be in fact clever but could had problems because the police chef is also clever or few of the hostages were witty to alternate their initial plans. 
I can go on more but in summary, I think the show doesn't deliver what it is promising. The only reason I am writing this review is the fact that it has 8.8 on IMDb and it is in my opinion overrated. I started watching this show because a lot of my friends told me to do it. I was curious about all the hype, so I gave it a try. From the first episode I just couldn't keep away from it. The plot is amazingly good. Of course it's not something that has never been done before, but I believe it has never been done with this kind of quality.<br/><br/>Acting is on point, characters are unique and you can really connect with them, feel pity for them, hate/love them.<br/><br/>Of course this is all subjective but I can't really understand how someone can give a 1/10 or 2/10 to these series. For me this is the best series I have ever seen. You should definitely give a try and see for yourself If you like Prison Break, you will love La casa de papel because both of them are awesome police series that you can´t stop watching until you end it. Certainly the most impressive thing in the series is the plan that Professor created and the things that he knows and the ones he made up out of the blue. 
 Beyond the violence and the desire to steal the money, the series talk a lot about love, and forbidden love. A philosophy that the series shows is that in some cases love ruins everything because some people could not get involved, but some of them do, and this can be really bad for the plan.
 One thing that is really commented in the series is about how family is important; how some people can lose their minds if they do not have a present family and how people can fix their minds too with someone of his family by their side.
 In general this series is fantastic and really original, some of the things that happen there I would never have been able to think about by myself. I really recommend it. Great idea for story. Magnificent details that make you secretly smile. But let's be honest. There are huge plot holes, directing mistakes, unreasonable decisions and there are many times that even the smartest, behave like idiots. Frankly, I'd love to see them caught or killed. I root for the police here. That's how much I dislike the characters. And guess what? Nairobi is not going to die, duh! First things first!
Ratings do matter.
My friend, who trusts IMDb ratings, found out that La casa de papel has got a fair amount of 10s and thought that it's a good film series to watch. But boy he was mistaken.
Let's start from the fact, that these robbers are not smart, but very stupid and incompetent indeed. Main character, Tokyo is so stupid and acts like she's got no experience in her criminal life. In the very first series, she almost makes a mistake, which even I would not do.
The series is full of nonsense, if a human gets shot millions of bullets, one should die, right? hm.. not in this series..
Why would I even want to watch this silly stuff? I still finished it hoping that it would be interesting at the end. I was still mistaken. The series is entertaining. But I can't stand one thing, you are supposed to be amazed and entertained by how smart and well thought out the thieves and the cops are. And this really is not the case when almost every single smart idé works because of one thing, and in the next episode, they break that one thing or rule that made the trick work. The series is very inconsistent within its own rules regarding the story, and that makes the entire "smart" thing broken and less entertaining. In some situations, the thieves have every little detail thought out, and just skip other dilemmas that would be huge problems for the cops and the thieves. <br/><br/>When you really want to see whats gonna happen, and how the characters will solve the ongoing small situations, they often cut the scenes and skip forward in time. This feels like a really cheap way to force the story in the specific angle they want it to go, rather than let it play out as it would do in real life. With more interesting dilemmas, emotions and a story which would probably not go in the direction they skipped forward to. <br/><br/>A third thing that really waters out the series and makes it much less exciting is the never-ending flow of standoffs that literally leads nowhere. Many times two or more totally different opinions arguing. And they don't come to a collective agreement at all, and still, the story goes on as if they did. Until they reach a new dilemma with different views, and after some fighting, the story goes on as if they all agreed to do the same thing. <br/><br/>And a fourth thing that bugged me. The crew that made the entire heist looked like a bunch of incompetent children compared to the squad of serbs that arrive at the end. This really reduces the original crew to zeroes and makes the point of the series regarding uncontrollable emotions look like a simple unprofessional trait. And why would not the professor use the Serb squad for the entire heist?! He had literally 5 months to see that the other team were too emotional and different to be able to cooperate smothly. My first review here. And only because I was lured by some friends to watch it.<br/><br/>Well, you know the feeling you have, when you start to want all the protagonists to die? In this series this is what you will think most of the time if you don't fall asleep.<br/><br/>Most of the things are done childish wrong because this suited the script writers. You can see this in every episode.<br/><br/>You are hyped to see this genius plan by this genius "professor" and what you get is a soap opera with deux ex machina that saves the day.<br/><br/>The professor is not only a "genius", he is also a kind of super agent that can solve any critical mistake in a matter of minutes or even seconds.<br/><br/>I believe there is no point to start numbering the obvious plot holes. It would take 10 pages at least.<br/><br/>The hardened (teenage looking) pro robbers have no issues to come in sexual relations with the hostages. Really? I thought they are all committed to their cause driven by personal dramas that would make them work like a machine.
What you get is teenage behavior that would make this story end badly for them in episode 1.<br/><br/>The most ridiculous scene so far was this one: There is a robber-girl (Nairobi) that is telling her drama at Tokyo. (She lost her child and now wants the heist to succeed so she can get it back.) She is crying and very depressed.
And what they are doing next? They are drinking Tequila, get dressed like they would go out to lure men, start twerking and slap each other's asses.<br/><br/>Nice. I am very happy that i watched it and i have already recommended it. But the reason i have rated it 8 and not 10 since i ideally think this is a masterpiece keeping in mind the intelligence behind the series. Every detail was figured correctly and the screenplay was apt too. However there are illogical stuffs added which i think takes the charm away but its okay .. they are much avoidable and it doesnt really hamper your exprerience though since its after all cinema so dont apply much brains to a few scenes.
PS - loved the background scores Rarely do I disagree with IMDB ratings in general but this show is not that good, maybe it's the really poor dubbing but the actors all seem far too emotional.<br/><br/>No one can speak a sentence without screaming or bursting into tears.<br/><br/>A bit of that is okay but after a few episodes I genuinely took a dislike to all of the main characters. Ep. 1 was good but as each episode unfolds the story just gets more ridiculous, no siege in the history of mankind has gone on for so long for so little, the plot is held together by hysterical outbursts from characters.<br/><br/>The female police inspector storms in and out of every scene not actually doing anything, at times I laughed out loud at her lines and reactions, in real life I think one of her co workers would have shot her, she creates more panic and threat than the bank robbers.<br/><br/>Too silly, too long, too much over acting. Please make an end to it. Don't waste such a good series. I thought the whole show was excellent. Lots of user reviews thinking they know how to pull off a heist better, but I would definitely recommend :) will leave you walking round the house singing Bella ciao Not really understanding all the 1 star ratings on this show as it deserves nothing less than a 10. I'm not one to watch TV shows or movies in other languages, but this grabbed my attention from the beginning and had me at the edge of my couch at the end. Such an emotion felt series with a crazy storyline.
Highly recommend to anyone who has the thrill for something exciting! I have heard about this show for ages and since lock down I thought that I´ll start watch it. Bear in mind that I LOVE most tv-shows.<br/><br/>But Money Heist has to be one of the most boring tv shows. It has a good plot in like the first episode but the problem with the show is the characters, they are SO STUPID and make so many stupid unrealistic decisions throughout the first season.<br/><br/>I watched like 5 of the first episodes and I AM NOT watching any more. I recommend NOT watching gone wrong soap opera. What a waste of time and piece of crap, nothing makes sense... The professor is showcased as all knowing, all might God who has a solution for everything, does karate chops and beat up trained cops like flies.. I want my time back Heard such great things about this series. Finally got around to watching it and realize it's disappointing. These are some of the dumbest, undisciplined bank robbers ever. No one watches the hostages, the robbers are all over the bank leaving the hostages unattended. Cops leave the hostage scene to go eat lunch. This is like a longer, worse version of Inside Man, which was actually a good movie. I don't need to see anyone die, but a organized team would be nice. But then again, I'm only 6 episodes in, so maybe it will get better. Story showed promise at the start but lost its way, a so called master plan acted out by some of the worst 'career criminals' you'd wish to meet. Only thing successfully stolen here was my time I don't understand all the hype around this show. Since the first season it is full of cliches, dumb dialogues, sop opera and gay drama (especially after Netflix picked it up). It's so predictable that you can anticipate the conversation and sometimes even the words the characters are going to say. Many scenes and conversations were so annoying we had to fast forward them. The ideology behind these series is basically one - a bunch of egocentrics trying to get it all convincing all others about their "noble" motives.<br/><br/>Could't finish the show. Don't waste your time If you enjoy telenovelas or soaps, this might be up your alley. Unnecessary drama, and stretching out the plot. Am on the fifth episode of season one but so far the story hasn't advanced that much.
The robbers seem like they had a week to know each other and prepare for the robbery, coz the tensions and unprofessional conduct doesnt feel like they had months to prepare like they want us to believe.
The show wants us to believe the lead negotiator is the best there is, but so far, it feels like she is not as good as advertised. She made one mistake so far and she has a nervous breakdown, and what does she do, she calls her mum and tells her everything. Doesn't seem so professional, and comes off as an amateur or like its her first time doing this.
The characters are all very sloppy, making stupid mistakes just to stretch out the story. Its just lazy writing in my opinion, though it appeals to a certain audience i know. Stopped after watching 5 episodes... After hearing lavish praises from all over this Spanish make .. Tried to give this a try and trust me I have watched lot of other Series this one not what you hear.. Poor narration, characters, story and overall concept instead of robbing the bank you print the money.. God no!!! Save your time.. A series of extreme logic errors. the scenario is very unreasonable. Harmful to mental health I was completely hooked at the start of the first season. Unfortunately, the donkey like logic manifested itself early through out the show.<br/><br/>Perhaps its the 50 armed guards whose aim is worst than stormtroopers. Perhaps its because of Tokyo breaking into the bank for the dumbest reason while everyone else is trying breaking out. Perhaps its because of the hostages plotting their escape a meter away from the robber whom must certainly be blind and deaf to not see what is happening. Perhaps its the cringe-worthy and overdone love scenes. If I were to write out the flaws in season 3 and 4, this review would turn into a never ending story.<br/><br/>TLDR: It starts off as a decent show, but the lackluster logic dwindles this show to a level that can compare to none other than the last season of Game of Thrones. 9.5/10 FOR THE FIRST TWO SEASON<br/><br/>very interesting series with pathos despite some little sensible passage in the plot in my opinion<br/><br/>6/10 FOR THIRD AND FOURTH SEASON<br/><br/>a useless continuation for a series that would have been perfect up to that point. the characters seem to be transported in a telenovelas as beautiful. the plot is flat. Such a pity This series is more overrated than it actually deserves. The concept is very good but acting isn't its best work. Romance isn't amazing either, there are even so many flaws in there. They made a 120- hours heist for 2 years/seasons and yet they didn't stop there. Over-enthusiastic scenes even when not needed. The only reason it had me for 2 seasons was its intro music and finally I gave up because of being excessive bored. Plot is far too contrived, the acting is weak and non of the characters have any bite, these are supposed to be hardcore career criminals!
Whoever thinks this is close to reality has led a very sheltered or privileged life. I Stopped watching after two seasons as it had turned into little more than a soap opera. After season 2 money heist loses all the glamour there was no reason for another season...
however it is worth seeing the first 2 seasons but don't watch at the other 2 if you want to keep a nice memory of this
My rate is for all the seasons that why you see 4 out of 10
My rate for the first 2 seasons is 7 out of 10 First 2 seasons are good/average but 3rd and 4th will probably bore you. If you are looking for a great series with something different (unique) to watch this show is not for you. If it weren't for my obsession with completing the shows, I wouldn't be completing this show. The storyline sometimes gets to clichÃ©. It feels like professors knows too much which doesn't seem like possible. The show's thrilling upto some extent that's for sure but it doesn't give you what you're looking for. Storyline is too obvious, you can easily predict the next scene. In what country head of the state intelligence talk directly with local torturer? The grave Rio dug is still there that too with coffin as if they are waiting for professor to discover it. Too obvious, too too obvious. I completed it just because I just wanted to get it over it. "Overhyped" is the only word that come to my mind for this. I ywaned watching this trying to understand why this is so popular. It has started treating the audience for granted. The writing is just like a forgetable bollywood movie. Season 4 is the worst. I'll point out somethings
1. We don't need a boring recap of a character who has to the present.
2. The show writer distorts the story of previous seasons to create money-making new season Which is not good.
3. Just because of the first seasons on the fanbase has created a hype which will get killed by boring season like the 4th one.
4. No intelligent writing and really stupid character except the professor.
5. It's difficult to love a character. I literally laugh and enjoyed when one main character got killed in season 4 I (regrettably) watched the entire series, all four seasons! I now look back and wonder, why oh why did I did this to myself? The fourth season was totally disrespectful to the audience. My 7 year old daughter would have written a better script. Almost zero progress in an entire season, pointless and endless flashbacks. OK guys, we all liked Berlin but you decided to kills him, get over it, you can't bring him back in every episode to capitalise on his popularity.<br/><br/>Third season was mediocre at best and then season four happened! Oh dear, what a comedy! Naked Gun at its best! Hostages that rape other hostages, transexuals trying to create plot twists (unsuccessfully), a moron (Rio) who allow a guy with skills of Rambo, Chuck Norris, Bruce Willis and Arnold Swargeneger combined to walk into a panic room that could also serve as weapon depository for a small army unit! And then we go beyond that to Avengers universe! Yes, you can see a single guy avoiding hundreds of bullets shot from 5 meters! Wait, it gets even better: He is killing a character that we spent three episodes to save and he allows a psychopath sex addict with narcissist syndrom to remove foreign objects from a grenade from his body...I won't continue watching it While the plot is interesting, it also feels frustrating. It feels like it's being stretched to add episodes and seasons. The plot looks extremely fabricated and implausible, particularly from Raquel's perspective - the way she freely carry her newly founded boyfriend (Salva) around to critical investigations and police sites.
Is Spain's law agencies really that dumb?
And then Raquel is shown to have streaks of brilliance and out-of-box thinking and then she doesn't connect obvious dots, all to suit the vagaries of the plot.
Circumstances always suit the Professor somehow.
Would I recommend watching it - maybe yes but not for the brilliant script as the script has too many flaws that frustrate the life out of you at least once per episode. Nice film with good plots and twists. But far, far too much of unnecessry kissing and hugging, emotional scenes dragged beyond limit and other timewasting fillings.
It is like first 'story' (two first seasons) HAD to have nearly 20 episodes rather than make a proper cutting. Make a new cutting and reduce to 5-6 episodes. Then it would be an intense thriller.
Now it was more like 'when is something going to happen'. The concept behind the show is quite captivating, and seasons 1 and 2 were thrilling, and deserving of a 7.5/10. However, yhat's were the story rightfully ends. Netflix had no business bringing the show back for more seasons, as it showed when season 3 aired last year. With nothing brand new to add to the story, they just recicled the premise and format from the first two seasons. SPOILER ALERT: Killing Nairobi off in season 4, one of the few characters that actually motivates viewers to keep on watching every episode, was a horrible mistake (kudos to Alba Flores, by the way, marvelous acting). Good things
1. Amazing acting from most of the cast. Especially the professor. This is what carries the show.
2. Some of the script. The clever ideas from the professor, like when they switch the masks of everybody so the two SWAT team guys cannot infiltrate. Also when they put a hidden microphone in the glasses of Angel.
3. Good intro song.
4. Great disguises of the heroes when they finish the heist.
5. Bella Ciao song.<br/><br/>Bad Things
1. It was nice one time when the Denver and Berlin pulled Guns at each other in the toilet, because Denver was in love with Monica. However, after that this trick of "pulling guns at each other without shooting" has been used sooo many times that it is too much.
2. Characters creating drama for no reason, just to make something happen or to help the plot. For example, when Tokyo suddenly pulls a gun on Berlin (Russian roulette), and then later Berlin throws her out of the bank. This was a very stupid decision from Tokyo, and no one would do that in real life.
3. Berlin Sacrificing himself in the end, when there was no need for it. They could just have gone in the tunnel and then blow it up. A person sacrificing himself is already a clichÃ©, so when it is being used it must make sense and be very clever.
4. The SWAT team waited to storm the building until the LAST MOMENT when the robbers finished to print all the money. In the begging they were worried about hostages and in the end they didn't care. That is a very sudden change of mind from the police/government, which is convenient for the plot. I think that they should either storm the building right away, or not storm it at all to try and save the hostages.
5. When the SWAT team actually storm the building, we see the most stupid and unrealistic gun fight. Both sides shoot at each other for a long time and no one gets killed.
6. The scene with Tokyo is coming back through the main door on a motorcycle WITHOUT GETTING SHOT. That is just unbelievable and unrealistic. Even when the professor saves her from an armed police transportation, that is just too much. I mean these guys are already stealing 2,4 billion euro or whatever, but now they also have to be like superman/wonder woman and get Tokyo away from an armed police truck. Tokyo should not have been acting stupid from the beginning and then all that other stuff would not have happened.
7. Not everything has to be in the last second. Raquel gives the address of professors secret location to the Swat team, and they storm the place 1-2 minutes after the heroes escape
8. The scene where the professor smashes the coffee cup from grandmothers hand. If the grandmother cannot remember that, then how the is she able to take care of her granddaughter and herself?
9. Unrealistic portrayal of gunshot wounds. When Arturo and Monica get shot, they get a small surgery and in a couple of days they are okay. In real life, if someone gets shot in the shoulder or in the leg, they would probably take months if not years to recover. I don't know the exact timeline, but it is not a few days. You can google it if you want.
10. Like other reviewers have pointed out, they are the bad guys, so it does not make sense to just let them get away with the money to live in Paradise. Instead maybe they could have burned the money and give some sort of message to the government. It is like the movie "Inside Man" where they also rob a bank, but they don't take any money, they only steal some documents to bring down a corrupt former nazi guy. Or maybe they should just end up in jail, I don't know what exactly, but there has to be some consequences or some good-moral-reason-explanation to why they are doing it. Or else this whole "resistance" and bella ciao theme does not make sense if they just drink Pina Colada in the Caribbean.
11. Season 3, 4.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Other Notes
<ul><li>The relationship between the professor and Raquel has some similarities with Breaking Bad. Here I mean Walter and Hank.</li><li>The idea of giving hostages the same disguise as the robbers is from the movie "Inside Man"</li></ul> The fourth part is not worthy of the final in the series, it is a disappointment Nice idea for a movie not a series , making too much time for extending their episodes, some Spanish amateurs actors with many non professional directing , could be much more better than that with more working , some how enjoyed some episodes of first part , and second part still watching some episodes good some not , great idea of act but poor making it sad for that ðŸ˜£ðŸ˜” You can't deal with the forth season. So bad... no words This is the perfect example of how you can RUIN a nice show with some stupid ideas and none plot . Season 3 was not good at all but season for 4 omg it failed any expectations . Really nice job... Yeah season 1 and 2 are great, but suddenly it's turning out to be quite boring and obvious. End it already. Want to watch the Season 4 but can't make up my mind for clichÃ©d sequences on the show. Plot starts out great ingenious. But quickly fizzles episode by episode. Turns into long drawn out boring soap opera. Overloaded by testosterone and estrogen in typical soapy European fashion. Too many pretty young actors portraying hardened criminals but look more like yuppie espresso sipping umbrella cafe patrons. The actors that pretend to look like real hardened criminals are over the top. Mohawks and such. Right. Thumbs up to Madridywood and Netflix for trying to make a suspenseful, intelligent, crime thriller. But this one is a long watch and doesn't pay off. This is the most overrated show I have ever watched. If you want to see something intense, then you should death note. Not worth the hype. Many events in the season are completely illogical. The show was created in Spain on May, 2017 and aired in Antena 3 then acquired by Netflix for global airing in the late 2017. After the massive success of first two parts Netflix invested more to make another season. Hence we got to watch part 3&4 about a new heist.<br/><br/>We start this part from where we left it on part three; Nairobi shot to almost death, Lisbon caught and falsely executed to entrap Professor. Following which The Professor, filled with grudge and sorrow declaring this a war. So from a spectator's point of view it's a total mess, which we expected to recover this season.<br/><br/>From the very first episode of part 4(The thumbnail of which is I guess "Inspired" by a very prominent picture/one of the many posters of Vertigo by Alfred Hitchcock which has absolutely nothing to do with story) we see that the healing of the mess has started with surgical procedure done to Nairobi, Professor as always managing his way out of the trouble and with them the story moves along.<br/><br/>As like the first two/three parts of the show the acting, cinematography and editing stand out; on the contrary the quality of the script goes down only. The show was originally created by Alex pina, who overviewed the writing of the first two parts and some of the episodes of part three but the rest of part three and entire part four is mainly done by Ana Boyero, Luis Moya, Emilil Diez and several other writers.<br/><br/>A major surgical procedure done just right by Tokyo with no professional to guide her, Palermo teaching an A grade assassin how to break free from a handcuff, Arturo harassing women at the midst of heist, messing up with military helicopter, a top grade police officer having tons of options in his hand just passing information to a known criminal, Alicia without even watching the CCTV footage finding out professor and most importantly no story development what so ever. These are some massive glitches in writing in this part of the show.<br/><br/>To conclude, it's the same mess again; just like how we left it after part three and all we can do is wait for the next part to fix them up. This is so bad. A good idea, started with a lot of promise.<br/><br/>Why so much love and sex.<br/><br/>Too much style over content. I am at the last episode series one and I might not bother seeing the end.<br/><br/>Oh so much threat and no one ever gets killed. Is that a spoiler Despite the visible decline in quality that was demonstrated in Season 3, I remained optimistic hoping that Season 4 will inject the much needed adrenaline and clever twists that will bring the show to a deserved finale. Let me put it this way, if the third season began to show small but noticeable cracks in the foundation, the fourth season decided to put a bomb inside one of the cracks and bring down the entire Casa.<br/><br/>I think the objective of this season was to progress as little as possible because characters end up in the exact same situation as they were at the start. Every episode consists of 60% nonsensical romance or drama, 20% obligatory and pointless Berlin Flashback, 15% Police "Planning" and 5% of crazy action resulting in an admittedly good cliffhanger to make sure you stick around.<br/><br/>While the elements of the plan are clever, they are often presented in such a ridiculous fashion that reduces their impact. The overall flow is inconsistent due to constant loss of focus in an attempt to stretch every minute. I used to love this show as it effectively balanced wits, drama and action creating a trully addictive experience. Now, it has become a soap opera that is a shell of it's former self.<br/><br/>#moviesshmovies Writing just dropped off. Sad to see the show go from 9 to 7-8. Good series, but wtf happened in season 4?!<br/><br/>Annoying Charakters, stupid themes, backflash to a complete useless marriage... how can you not hate the new inspectora? And why are there so many couples???<br/><br/>Completely busted the whole stuff! Rating certainly not 8,5. It had potential, great plot, bad development. Unnecessary seasons. Tokyo's acting cringe af. Its really bad, it should've ended in season 2 or 3. The first season isn't even good enough to be watched outside. Why is there a Turkish character that looks like an Arab? what's the point here? What does he contribute to you and the script? We loved the first 2 seasons. Season 3 was OK. We stopped watching after a few episodes of season 4, slow, unlikely and boring. The first heist (Seasons 1 and 2 where I live) was great and had a very satisfying ending. However, due to the huge success, they decided to make another season and while it still has fun moments, it's not great anymore, I'd personally not even call it good. The characters are not believable anymore, everything feels extremely forced. While the first heist certainly had moments where I thought to myself: "Why in gods name are these people behaving like idiots?", in the second heist I rarely find myself watching a single episode without cringing at their dumb, erratic behavior.<br/><br/>Another huge issue are the action sequences, especially in Season 4 episodes 5 and 6. They are just horrible. About as realistic as action scenes in Fast and Furious or Transformers ... but cheap looking. Completely ridiculous.<br/><br/>Overall, the huge decline in quality made me pretty much lose all interest I had in the show. 6/10 just because the first heist was very fun. First season PERFECT
2nd season good
3rd season weak
4th season terrible Who are these people who rated it 8+...i am astonished. This series doesnt even deserve 7.5/10. the writer screwd up a good plot...it shows that the professor is the only intelligent character and all others around him are damn fools. How on earth can a chief investigator be used so meticulously. Most of the tricks that the professor played dont even have 30% chance of actually happening in a actual world. The professor acts more like a prophet or a magician. Most scenes are to fill the time slots n the rest to somehow pave the way to another episode. many low rated tv series are much much better n more sensible and praticable. However, that season one and two are a solid 7.5 in mine opinion. Season 4 makes that the serie is a mediocre 6.5. The biggest bummer is the gandia personage... They let this man look like a superhero. He should have died four times, but no this man is made out of steal Why do producers never know when to stop? It's ok to admit you've run out of ideas. You gave us two epic seasons now let us rest in peace geez.<br/><br/>Season 3 was forgiving, but season 4?!!!
This season was just a mass of irrelevant fillers that did absolutely nothing for the plot and action scenes that were so unrealistic. Not to mention the inconsistency in the characters? Cliche relationship dramas to kill time, a military assassin that somehow couldn't figure out how to get out of hand cuffs but was able to dodge 100 bullets fired in open air, the professor and Lisbon brought absolutely nothing to the table until the last 30 minutes, Nairobi died twice for audience reaction, and the transgender who was introduced took no part in anything.<br/><br/>
An insult to fans honestly. Just completed the season 3 and can't wait for the 4. Just diabolically beast type of thriller TV series Probably the best show ever made
Eagerly waiting for the season 4 The holes came along midway thru the 1st season and failure by the end of the 1st.
Great production, look and players. But a disappointment. I won't continue into the 2nd. For Berlin..The amount of nostalgia his scenes gave to me..I didn't care avout the heist...his performance astonished me even his death was astonishing...well played This is one of the best series ever.Each episode is very thrilling and it never dissapionts.Best series ever it so clever. The only good thing about this series is the first episode, which makes you think it may be interesting, but then you may start noticing the similarities with "Inside man" and wondering if it's going to go the same way.<br/><br/>You wish it would, because this is actually much, much worse.<br/><br/>Probably conceived by a teenager without a single original idea, the script revolves around a bunch of stereotypes, such as Tokyo, the sexy thief (who would probably be better cast as a stripper); the mastermind Professor (an autistic that oversmart everybody); the ice-cold, hardened criminal Berlin (who is gossiping nonsense more than a Tarantino character) etc...<br/><br/>I gave up after the episode in which Berlin, for no reason whatsoever, takes one of the female hostages to his office and tie her to a chair (no reason for him to do that, just to drag along the story), while in flashback we see Tokyo and toy boy Rio having sex in the toilets (a scene repeated in countless movies) and the mighty Professor outsmarts everybody once again.<br/><br/>Teenagers will love it, because the bad guy are actually supposed to be good and there is nothing bored people like more that a fantasy where bad people do bad things and end up winning. Well there are two characters "Tokio" and "Rio". They are literally piece of garbage. Ridiculous plot. 20 hours I'll never get back. The characters are thin and shallow. The cops are all made to look completely incompetent. The writing is terrible. The actors do the best they can with a poorly written plot and script. Don't waste your time on this drivel. It used to be great, now it is just a sad story.
And the story isn't even finished. I think Spain just kicked Hollywood in the nuts.
This show is so incredibly intelligent, I want to marry it! Please someone tell Tokyo to look at people and camera like a normal, usual human being not like an ox. Does she really consider her look sexy ? (I am gonna be sick)
Inspector has only one expression for all situtations which makes me bang my head up against the walls<br/><br/>and yes the show is... (Now, I am vomiting) Extremely annoying characters like that kid from walking dead, all of them. The police inspector is especially annoying and incompetent. The hijackers behave like small children, constantly arguing and picking ridiculous fights. You start hoping they die.
Constant monologues and unnecessary filosofical pauses.
The police tent of operations is also open for all public to visit. And oh how the plot hole list goes on.... It has more holes than a swiss cheese.
Should be in dictionary for overrated. To enjoy go see with zero expectations. The series seem to start with a good promise and a thrilling tempo but it never fully develops into something meaningful. The main storyline almost halts solely relying on the tension. The subplots are boring, unrealistic, unoriginal and slows the pace even more. It just swings from an unbelievable and unnecessary topic to another.<br/><br/>It obviously tries to extend the airing time with lots of filler moments and sadly filler episodes. <br/><br/>This is only good for those who are willing to buy the far fetched plot in exchange for nonsense thrills. <br/><br/>This show has very few surprise elements and it revolves around the same topics.<br/><br/>Just like the heist story , the TV show goes from awesome to disaster quickly. How can this be rated so high! I sat through the entire 1st season hoping for something, anything good to come from this. It's awful.
It is so fake, cheesy, and the plot is just dumb. The acting, dialogue, I just can't say how bad it is. Save yourself the disappointment and just watch Oceans 11. A gem of a TV show. Part 1 and 2 were maganificent! Well written! acting was phenomenal! Binge worthy! This is in my top 3 best TV shows; along with GOT and DARK. This covers everything you need in a TV show with action, thriller, suspense, love, and bits of funnies especially with Berlin. <br/><br/>Ignore the negative reviews, trust me, I'm a stickler for reviews, watch it, this won't disappoint you. Thank you Alex Pina and others for La casa de papel. Bravo! What a Hype! And then this....unreliable story board, bad actors (Raquel), clumsy realization. Sorry guys, not what I expected after all this fancy Reviews.
Inside Man remains my first choice. I mean i have seen hundreds of series all my life and this has definitely made a place in my top 5. I mean each character did an outstanding job with the role . There are few things which are hard to digest but other than that it was a perfect one. The first few episodes of the 1st season are killers and they get the viewer hooked up. Good direction, costume design, ideas on the plot, cast. acting.<br/><br/>But somehow all this seems to end around episode 4 or 5, when the show becomes a mashup of anything. It's full of meaningless backstory that comes along with the actual happening and there is no room for the viewer to connect the dots. I can't explain without a spoiler but I will give a metaphoric example:<br/><br/>Say that the protagonist has a stain on his shirt. It's meaningless right? Well the show will throw a flashback on how the stain got there. For once or twice it's ok but it does it so many times that it starts feeling like an interruption for advertisements. It's trully tiring and my patience only got me to episode 11, two episodes before the season closure that I trully don't care what will happen. Netflix should add a button "skip flashback" specially for this show. This is what happens when netflixnbuys a shoe jist to make money. So stupid. Recently watched season 3, and its just amazing. Its an adrenaline Ride. And the way it has ended, i am really looking for season 4. Saw this title a few times on Netflix but never watched it until I could no longer hold my curiosity...<br/><br/>My only wish is I should have watched it sooner...<br/><br/>Character development and storyline unfolding is brilliant, as are the social evolutionary traits of the individuals in the gang.
The chemistry between the actors is highly palpable and adds a great dimension to an already amazing story<br/><br/>I binge watched this until my eyes burned, at night i couldn't sleep and sometimes found myself sneaking in a new episode at 4 in the morning..
Simply amazing...<br/><br/>and oh...Nairobi, mi amore ! It sucks. everything they use is a played out trope. i wish i could say more, but every plot element is just so shoddily placed like a "love conflict" does nothing to spice up the plot. definitely for the novela fans. certainly nothing to appreciate artistically. This is one of the greatest Tv series that I have seen in the last a few years. I persistently recommend you to watch it :) Can someone explain why the hostages just don't run out the door? There are so many instances where clearly they are unguarded while the robbers are all just bickering that it doesn't make sense. I really can't understand what does one find in that show. Sloppy, full of voids and silly politics... This season is LEGEN wait for it DARY. One of the best season. 10 out 10 rating. The show starts off really well, hooking the audience on the plot of the perfect robbery. There's great acting from lots of at the time fairly unknown actors (at least to me) and in general the cast seems like a great fit for their characters.<br/><br/>For season 1 I would call this a really good series with very few things one could criticise. Towards the end it starts to drop off a little though with things feeling stretched out a bit.
With season 2 it all starts to go downhill. I won't spoil anything but it really becomes very cringeworthy to watch, it almost feels like someone wrote a parody on romance and action movies. It continues to become less and less believable to a point where I personally just gave up and let it happen waiting to see the end. Especially at the very end there's a scene with the main protagonist and it was so embarrassing to watch, it made me feel embarrassed about telling my friends how great this series is after watching the first couple of episodes.<br/><br/>It feels a little like the writers were pushed to add a second season and add more drama and excitement through stupid and stereotypical action scenes. Unfortunately this is not suitable to just watching the first season so the series is ruined by the second half, definitely a real shame. I will not say much about the plot or the actors, because both were beyond excellent. The chemistry between the actors was unbelievable, and the relationships between the characters were heart-breaking. I was hooked throughout all the episodes due to the incredible plot and its fast pace. <br/><br/>As for the finale, it left no loose ends in the plot, but left me in tears. So emotional, so powerful. Sometimes we don't watch shows to have the most accurate depiction of reality, rather than get away from this very reality. La Casa de papel manages to give hope in so many ways. <br/><br/>This show is different than anything else. Just watch it already. I'm not one to binge watch serials but this is a must watch! You never know what's happening till the end, twists and turns galore. The acting is top notch and I recommend watching it in Spanish with sub titles, just gives a better feel and gets you more involved. The girl Tokyo can not follow the plan, I want to jump scenes with this character. Such a shame, close to being really good. Great idea, soooo many technical inaccuracies that even a child would notice. Are all of these positive reviews by the same person, all very similarly written. Sad. Oh well, some you win. The perfect plan with the most lucky unstable group. I don't understand why this series is so famous . I understand only kids . I did not expect that season 3 will be so good! Great dialogues, nice scenery, very good cut scenes and cross story telling. You can watch the whole season in one breathe and that speaks for itself. I just can recommend the 3rd season and also the rest of c.d.p. a lot! Can't wait for Season 4! I wish they would give us more episodes and don't leave us hanging! It delivers, its exciting and I really hope we'll get more of Money Heist soon!!!! Improbable story, head police lady wore blouse showing half her assets, makes love to bad guy not knowing he was bad guy, voice over woman was reading from printed page at all times and in general the whole darn show just stunk but I watched it anyway. I learned a good lesson for future Netflix series/movies. It I think they stink, quite watching. Thanks for education, NetFlix. I love you anyway. This series was one the best ever thriller i have seen in recent time. It's was like an addiction to binge the entire series. The characters are extremely well chosen and they play an amazing part through the entire play. Makes Too often too less Sense. A Genius put the worst criminals you can Imagine, to the worst team you can Imagine. A love story, sry 2 love storys or 3!?, this is for fans of Twilight or csi new York etc BRILLIANT SERIES!!In every way "la casa de papel" is stunning!It describes the feelings of a common south European citizen at this time about the economy and society!Great actors!Great script!Great music!Great scenes!Great plot!10' from a Greek fan!!! Loved the acting, sound tracks and of course the suspence. Pedro Alonso brings the comedy to this series...he is a phenomenal actor.i can't stop laughing when I see his acting what makes this series sooooo good.All the cast are very good but he is too good.i am addicted. From the first episode it was perfect ! Everything was such well thought and placed in the series . Every episode revealed as much as you need to know but also built up anguish in order to keep watching it! Really waiting forward to see the next season! If you like money, you'll love it.
If you like crime scene, you'll love it.
If you like to see heist, you'll love it.
This is best best series, I've ever seen. It keeps you involve in to the episodes. I didn't get bored in any of the episode. It keeps you thinking what will happen next and show different things. May be you expect something but something different happens. May be you never thought of this to happen. I enjoyed the series a lot. If I see any episode, I feel to see next and next and next till finish. Finished in 3 days completely. Don't compare this to any other series or movie, all have different aspects. I liked all the characters, acting, direction, cinematography and execution. It's the best. Must watch series! I would HIGHLY recommend to watch this. Reason<br/><br/>You would understand the "WHAT IS PERFECT PLAN and HOW TO PLAN PERFECT?"<br/><br/>Special THANKS to Professor (Álvaro Morte) and Berlin (Pedro Alonso). 
Berlin you are the HERO. You could have stayed with team and blow the TUNNEL :(<br/><br/>Tokio is Brave girl with less brain :)
Nairobi is Brave and Smart girl :)
Denver is sweetheart guys... I think Monica took right decision :)
Rio had a chance but he is a team player :)
Moscow has PAPA respect :)
Twin bro has endless bonding :)
Raquel is supercop with kind heart :)<br/><br/>Rest all characters have justified there part as NO one else could do like them.<br/><br/>Respect for this team and finally... Bella Caio Bella Caio Bella Caio :) :) :) Yes there are a few holes clearly left wide about, but this is a very big storyline to fill. The show is so well put together for being such a great heist story. I fell in love immediately. The last episode of part 2 had me in overwhelming tears. That's when I know a show could not have possibly gone more perfect. I don't understand how there could be such negative reviews about it. It really portrayed an amazing eye opener to who really are the good guys and bad guys of certain criminal activity. Love it so much, and I am a very critical person when it comes to tv shows.
But I definitely liked everything about this show, plot, music, and most of all the cast ! Amazing one ! Every episode will make you want to see more. Amazing mind blowing masterpiece. Is like a mix between Death Note with a Heist. I don't know what is wrong with the people hating it or saying that the reviews are fake or paid. If you hate this is probably because you don't like hearing spanish actors (or you are a racist). Spanish is my first language so this was natural to me, I was concentrated on the amazing actors and story (and i don't normally watch Spanish TV shows). Give it a try you won't regret it. Smart, original, suspenseful... the list goes on. Hooked me at the very beginning and kept me wanting more throughout the whole season. The whole idea is just great; 13 episodes, one heist. Highly recommend it. This show is probably one of my favorite shows of all time, because I ussaly like binge watching shows but when it comes to la casa I can't just watch one episode and stop I have to watch the entire season at once. Which is great but then you feel so empty after the show Finishes because the show is just an amazing masterpiece. I just finished this on Netflix and what can I say. This series is a masterpiece. The professor is really good. Anyway, i really enjoyed watching this, you should try too. A great story well told .
Everything about this series is faultless .
Acting , direction , plot , thrills .
I finished Season 1 last night and can't wait for Season 2 Today,after finishing the series, I decided to change my rating from 9 to 5. Altho this series starts well, the development of the plot and the characters is disappointing and towards the end it becomes completely unbearable. In the second part nothing makes sense anymore and the show feels like some cheap mexican soap opera where everything can happen. Characters change their minds, hating or loving each other every 5 mins, they do completely ridiculous things for no reason. The police on the other hand just sits there doing nothing.They tried to get in the building 10 times in the first episodes and then in the next 20 they just gossip in a tent. However the best thing is the ending episode. Even a 5 year old kid would have come up with something much more realistic. Such a shame. Better then much other series
I hope this series will be continued.. I've started to feel that I'm watching an indian movie. The huge amount of unreasonable scenes made me stop watching la casa de papel. Plot holes, terrible writing, ridiculous characters. Absolutely overrated Season 1&2 good 3&4 Just trash Just make it longer & boring Can it get any worst than this<br/><br/>Stay tuned for season 5 Somehow on a beautiful plot they were able to mess up the story line. It seems like the guns police have are not working, and the police dog can't smell, making everything one sided without any logic or proper reasoning. I am rather mad on this than disappointed. One of the best series I've watched. The acting, the story just all done so well. Can't wait for season 4. Simply amazing. It gets better by the season. Great show the best in netflix. Can't wait for a new episodes If there is a spanish TV Show you can't miss, so its definitly this one. It gets you into finishing an episode after the other. Totally recommend it, can't wait to see whats coming in season 3. Criminals are not exactly the smartest bunch of people in the world as they don't have as many options to go to that line of work. So expect a ragtag group of people with several faults all held together by someone who isn't really a criminal but a planner. Things never go to plan and it was really interesting to see how he tried to account for many events and expected reactions of the police. Expect to eagerly await each series as you get drawn in to the many characters of the movie. Really enjoyed and can't wait to see more.... In the beginning ,I really hesitated to watch it,I thought that it would just be another thief story with the same start,story and end...and pretty much it was....but the characters,the storytelling,the way that the producers gave the story to the public was AMAZING!It kept me in the screen for a lot of hours day by day ,it made me think as I was a part of it, sometimes from the hostage and sometimes from the thieves side.An absolutely masterpiece that you should definitely try!If it had some boring moments,of course it had which series doesn't but all became past with this perfect end!And when I am talking about end I am talking about the half 2nd season!Thank you for this Netflix!I couldn't resist but watch the last episodes in a row,everyone should try it too! This is truly one of the best shows I've ever seen. That may sound like hyperbole but it's not, it's really that good. Great story, compelling characters and outstanding acting. I really cry in the end,also the way it end and i canot see it anymore!!!
i want mor season!!! Congratulations to everyone involved in this excellent series. It has a total of 999 minutes, which is like watching a movie 16,6 hours long. Many scenes were obviously "stretched" to fill in time. If it was a normal movie it would be trimmed down to 2,5 hours the most. Putting that aside, the scenario was partly taken from the Inside Man (2006), but with many more twists to the story. I still think the scenario was excellent and well played out.<br/><br/>One of the best series up-to-date that I have seen, and I have seen many. This is a "must see" movie and worth your time. It was so good that I hope they do NOT make another episode.<br/><br/>Special thanks to Álex Pina! I loved this series and watched over a couple days. Don't take too serious and you will find an exciting and original series. Only complaint for me was the English dubbing. wrong voices for most of characters and was pretty annoying. Would prefer to see the original with English sub-titles. This is one of the best shows i have ever seen . it has so much thriller . i never felt bored for a moment . i just didn't like it had many adult scenes so i couldn't watch it with my family . The show will keep you on the edge of your seat, and you really get attached to the characters. I know there's a lot of symbolism, and for many people it's about resistance. But to me the best parts were the love stories and the redemption of certain characters. I loved the acting of Pedro Alonso Ochoro (Berlin) and especially Alvaro Morte (El Profesor). All the acting was excellent, from the entire cast. I usually like tragic endings when I watch a thriller, because it's more realistic. But with this, you're rooting for the characters so much that you're hoping there won't be a sad ending. I've recommended this show to everyone I know. The third season is so greatful.
I have never seen a movie like this.
I dont have words to explain how excited i'm feeling right now 🔝🔝 People who are giving one rating probably don't know how to watch a TV show ..... Rip to them 😢 Wow this show is mind blowing I'm in love with each and everyone of them, every character had their own right with the scenes , the acting is top notch I applaud everyone for that brilliant performance, I'm in love with the professor period. Thank you so much for the amazing and hopefull ending, I know they are thiefs but they had my sympathy to wish they succeed in their operation. This series keeps you on the edge of your seat at all times. Great amount of action and meaningful messages along the way! Highly recommend it :) I have never reviewed any movie or series but with this one, I had to. This series is a masterpiece! Congratulations to Spain for delivering such an epic series, congratulations to Álex Pina for such mastermind behind all this, and congratulations to the actors, because of them I have laughed and cried. For those who don't know if they should watch, please do, you will go for the ride of your life! BELLA CIAO, professor! More of the same on season 2 of this excellent Spanish film series, Just binge watched on Netflix,, it seems Netflix seem to do foreign language shows a lot better than the American or English made shows, none stand out when compared to mainland European, why this is, well I think there's just better talent outside the mainstream it tells its own story when all I can watch on Netflix is subtitled, oh ya money heist is excellent, if u seen season 1 u won't need me to tell u how good it is One of the best series I've ever seen! action in every episode, and the level of drama is maintained until the very last minutes This episode is so good now waiting for the next season badly! Captivating yet mind blowing! speechless honestly, words can't express my thoughts but one question season 4 ???? y'all can't end season 3 like that , questions are invading my mind nonstop Hands down best series I have ever seen. Watched the whole of the second season in 2 days, truly brilliant! Actors, stroyline, directing everything! My go to series to recommend. The hype made me suspicious and the genre is not my favorite, but I usually enjoy good movies/shows, no matter the genre if they are good enough, and I was curious so I gave it a try... What a trip!
There are reasons for the hype, the show is very good: unexpected and good written script, the caracters are incredibly real (in a fictional situation, of course), the actors superb, the aestetic awesome and those touches of black humor here and there, mixed with the tension and the twists.
Some people find aspects to criticize and maybe they are right but, I can't think of one single reason for not watching the show. Around 18 hours of pure entertainment that let you craving for more seasons (there are only two, it's a limited series) and, at the same time, with an enormous smile in your face for the ride. One of the best series I've seen. Every single episode is more exciting than the other one No any well coordination between team shown in the series. Max emotional drama. Totally time consuming series. Zero value addition. This series one of the worst I ve ever seen. Plot holes as big as black holes, very bad acting and shallow characters. It is hard to tell who are bigger idiots, cops or robbers. It was good first 2 seasons, Now they have destroyed it. It is a complete dieaster. Everything is just so mediocre in this TV-series....plot, characters, actors you name it.
It only takes 20 minutes to realize you're watching total trash so you wonder....where's all these great reviews coming from? I shut it off after three episodes. Right after the robbers and hostages started falling in love after one day!! Got comical actually. No thanks. Horrible script. I want those hours back. Grossly overrated. The script doesn't make sense on so many levels that it's hard to believe it's not bad on purpose. But it isn't on purpose, it really tries to be umpredictable and clever, in the end it's only pretensious. Season 3 is pure crap, even though it is entertaining sometimes it is ruined, I'm completely in love with this tv show. I just finished the 3rd season in one day, I am just addicted of this show. Extraordinary actors, story, message, everything. This season made me so emotional , you fall in love with every single caracter. I can just say MASTERPIECE!!!
Can't wait for season 4!!!
#BELLACiaoo
Come back soon guys I normally don't post a review, but this is one of the most cliff hanging shows and it attracts you immediately. The professor is a G and you have to watch it. Words just can't describe this awesomeness of this TV show.
It is so terrific, on a level comparable to Breaking Bad, with EVERY actor delivering OSCAR rewarding performances making all
characters both likeable, loveable and remarkable, something very, very special only few shows were ever able to accomplish.<br/><br/>This show just will blow your mind. I just finished the new part 3
Can't wait for a new season
I love it I wasn't expecting much after the end of season 2 but this season turned out to be great and intense to watch, the storyline was amazing This show is absolutely one of my favorites! With the suspense and twists through the series, all the characters are unique and you have love for them all in a different way. The show has a berry good direction and I hope it continues to succeed for years to come!! #MoneyHeist
Heavy season 3 unexpected ending.<br/><br/>Thoroughly enjoyed it<br/><br/>Definitely season 3 has the toughest Hiest they had & it's gonna hook you up till the end as same as Season 1&2 made you.<br/><br/>SPOLIER nairobi injured<br/><br/>They confirmed Season 4 & Can't wait for it. WOW! JUST WOW!!! I just finished Season 1 and 2 of this series and I am hooked! I cannot wait for Season 3! Each and every episode keeps you hooked, I had to continue watching episode after episode! To all the reviews about characters "not doing their job" yes things do not go to plan and characters do things to jeopardise the plan however if everything went to plan it would not make a good series and keep it interesting. Love love love this series!!! If you want a never ending amazing ride then watch it This is one show which got me hooked from the very first episode until the last one. Couldn't stop in between. The storyline is very tight and gripping and the actors have paid their roles to perfection. Eagerly waiting for the 3rd season. I just binge watched all of it in Jul 2019, I know I'm late.. I have no desire at all to watch this at first place cause I don't find any people that I like.. Turns out, after watching the first ep, I'm completely in love with this one character..Guess who ? Yeah, it's not Professor, It's Berlin..Pedro Alonso are so amazing in this show as he potrays this character well enough to make me watch this show until Part 2.. However turns out, he's dead in the end of Part 2 and I'm here still waiting for Part 3 cause we just see him appears in the trailer.. Just nothing to say, don't miss this, each episode contains the same thrill and excitement, until the end.. vamos One of the Best of the Bests Internation TV show I have ever seen...I could not miss single moment from the episodes. A well played roles by great actors shows hidden resistance messeges against the unjust system makes you feel the robbers have the absolute right to survive the police.
Every single detail in this work has significant meaning
Congratulations to the Actors, Writer and director and all the teams with all respect for what they produced.
A10/10 is not even enough. Many films have been made with this genre, but this serial has everything . A show that greats no matter the language it's watched in. the characters are great, the plot is exquisite, and the show provides continuous entertainment. This is truly marvelously entertaining<br/><br/>There are many basic, stereotypical themes going on, but they are performed so very very well.<br/><br/>It should be no spoiler whatsoever, this is about a bank heist.<br/><br/>At first glance, you wouldn't think you could make a couple dozen episodes about a single bank heist, each episode totally engrossing.<br/><br/>The story-telling here is simple, direct, and yet masterful. There is a different kind of psycho-chick for every guy to ogle, there is a psycho-intellectual for everyone into intrigue, and the over-arching story ... is a guilty pleasure to cheer for.<br/><br/>The character development sneaks up on you, "Should I be cheering for the bad-guys?", and exactly how good is the average "good-guy", you will pause to look yourself in the mirror.<br/><br/>As I am watching it, there is voice-over in English from original Spanish. You can tell that this is not exactly matching the required breathing and emphasis of the original talent, but yet it is of very high quality and very quickly you won't notice the discrepancy and come to associate with the familiar over-dub voice acting.<br/><br/>Right now I am well in to "part 2" or "season 2" as we would say, and it is late at night and I can't turn it off. I loved it however i was extremely sad when Moscow died and i hope there will be another season. I'll probably never see anything so good again, i didn't see the English version, but man was this extremely brilliant and I 200% recommend!!! I love the professor's references to Greek music and history, the script is excellent. It's funny and serious, clever and few times emotional... The dialogues between Moscow and Tokyo was truly intelligent but Berlin stole the impressions. The whole cast was fine except Arturito and Alison (they are annoying). All episodes are interesting, full of action and doses of mystery. I'm waiting season 3, i believe it's going to be as good as previous. Found this octane show on Netflix by chance and fell in love. Absolutely amazing cat and mouse game with an abundance of thrill, intrigue, twists, creativity and fun. A heist show like no other! Eagerly waiting for season 3. This Spanish show is dubbed in English which makes English subtitles redundant. Highly recommended! I must say la casa de papel is an original series with great mind game ideas that will keep you hooked in all the episodes the ideas of the robbery plan are original and fresh.in my opinion it will be better if the producers worked more on the guns aspect, in some scenes we see robbers or police shooting from guns more then 200+ bullets without even reloading which clearly make no sense even for non guns experts. other then that it's a great series. I pretty much never watch shows in another language, but this one peaked my interest and I'm glad I gave it a chance. It's really good. I'm hooked.<br/><br/>I love how the story unfolds piece by piece and keeps you interested. And the casting and characters are just fantastic. What really strikes me personally as refreshing, is how believable the characters are. And all interesting in their own way. There's none of that typically forced American politically correctness pushing some obvious agenda that just ends up annoying you and ruining the immersion.<br/><br/>Give it a shot! It's well worth it. I for one can't wait for Season 2. One of the best serious far better than many American TV series. Loved it The worst serial ever.The serial has a plot for around 10 episodes which has completely been stretched out. As the show progresses, it becomes more illogical. Complete waste of your time. Do not believe the ratings. My boyfriend and i got really caught into this series, it's just great and full of unexpected moments. You just can't guess what happens next. The actors are awesome, each one of the main characters plays their role so authentic. 
I love that Netflix used the original language and didn't double it in English, this way all the emotions are brought 100% into the series. 
Great job! Unfortunately we have to wait until 2019 for the next season :( I love it all!<br/><br/>Best Series after Breaking Bad.<br/><br/>It never gets boring to watch it. So sad there will be no season 3. In a nutshell, it's an overrated series with neither good drama nor good heist. I couldn't sit through even season 1 completely. The lowered expectations of audience for a good series are clearly visible from the ridiculously high ratings for what the series offers, I went as far as episode 9 before my head started exploding with sheer boredom of drama, lack of lovable characters despite the overwhelming focus on their backstory and sheer amount of WTF moments during heist. These are robbers who are described as Pro/expert criminals who want to pull off a virtually impossible looking heist, all the while indulging in unbelievable levels of stupidity like Robbers falling in love with hostages, hostages falling in love with robbers, robbers performing surgeries, robbers committing amateur level mistakes and fooling collective intelligence of entire nation's security forces while doing this is something I cannot really find believable. There were few moments of brilliance with detailed planning but everything else going on there during heist was a juxtaposition to that brilliance. I read the detailed plot from 10th episode onwards to the end of second season and was glad i save myself some time and frustration. People who expect some logical explanation, some believable level of professionalism in a heist like this and in general expect some basic level of realism to the plot are going to be disappointed if they watch this series. This series doesn't make sense. Absence of logic. The police inspector in charge is the worse i've seen. They're talking about their plans at the coffee shop. It's a nightmare of a series. Potential was good, but lots of the scenes are illogic and wouldn't happened in real life. The robbers and police tactics is just not believable.<br/><br/>I rather watch an avenger movie, it made more sense. I'm not blaming the actors but the script. Somehow, they always find a way to get out of it.<br/><br/>Sorry it's a no for me! First season was really something... Unusual, fresh, modern, unpredictable and cool, i couldn't wait until next episode.
Unfortunately after the first season Casa de Papel has turned into a classic spanish novella. It went from "crime/ thriller" to "drama/ romance", Lots of soap opera twists, lots of crying and stupid unnecessary moves. Just classic spanish drama where it all ends with "Casandra your aunt is your mother, and your boyfriend is your brother" .... totally predictable and not interesting, Please give us back the old Casa de Papel. What the ruddy f is this bunch of arse about? Godawful dries. I don't even know where to begin, just 2 words 'skip it' It was ok for about a season and a half,but then they just started recycling stuff to make the show last longer,and they aded some weird superhero fearures to the charcters. In the end I started hating it because it was so overhyped. Why to extend 2 other seasons?<br/><br/>Stop it! Do not ruin it
No kore seasons pls<br/><br/>Season 1 & 2 10/10
Season 3 & 4. 1/10
So I gave 5/10 Where do I begin? Started watching mainly due to the very positive reviews and high scores given to this serial.<br/><br/>My opinion -<br/><br/>The basic heist uses a storyline used before many times, as early as 30 years ago, where the hostages would be made to dress up as the criminals to evade arrest.<br/><br/>The acting was amateurish overacting, at best. A high school could probably put up a much more professional production.<br/><br/>There was zero suspense. It fails to grip. I'm comparing this to a serial like 24, which I was unable to switch off as it had me on the edge of my seat !!!<br/><br/>There are far too many intermingled story lines that waste a great deal of time.<br/><br/>Watching this is almost akin to watching grass grow !!!<br/><br/>I honestly cannot understand all the high scores given to this.<br/><br/>In short, the ongoing pandemic situation around the world has us homebound with nothing to do. You probably can't do much worse than this. It's a real shame because I was loving season 1 and 2 and then in the final moment of the final episode of season 2 when Raquel goes to meet the Professor after a year has passed and he does the whole cheesy phone charger line I cringed hard and just thought oh god here we go... now three episodes in to season 3 and I'm feeling very disappointed. I wont even bother with season 4, apparently its complete s*** according to all of these other reviews anyway so I'm glad I'm not wasting any more time. Season 1 & 2 - "AWESOME" 10 stars
Season 3 & 4 - "AWFUL" 2 stars<br/><br/>Great series. One of the best one based on a heist till Netflix made it its own and screwed it up. Season 3 & 4 is just an insult to the previous seasons. S1&2 is really good while S3&4 are really sucks. Nonsense situations, stupid characters that make the film becomes really bad. The movie needs a new director, cannot hire a kid to make a film. S1&2 are worth for 7-8 mark but S3&4 just worth for 3-4 mark All the smart twists, brilliant script you get to see in first 3 seasons will go down in sewer drain in season 4. Season 4 lacks adequate planning and offers little surprises as compared to first 3 seasons This show could have ended in 5 episodes in season 1. It's full of guns pointing at each other on the same team. If it wasn't funny it would be really sad.<br/><br/>It's more like a telenovela where writers run out of the ideas for the story and they add crying, shooting, retrospective scenes every 5 minutes, hostages here and there and some sexual scenes.<br/><br/>The main point why I watched this show in the first place is the robbery, which is in the 6th or even 10th place in this show. I was hoping for a story to be focused more on the robbery. This show had a great potential...<br/><br/>It's possible to watch it if you really have nothing else to watch on your tv, otherwise skip it and save your time.<br/><br/>Don't trust these paid reviewers who rate this show with 9 or 10 stars. It was so bad that i had to make an account onn imdb to leave my comment for this series. It is yucckkkkkk. literally the more i watched the more i was building up anger in me to watch world's most lame screenplay. Soo many emotions in one time. Every character sort of tooo dramatic in delivering dialogues. Even writing this rebiew right now i am angry. Piece of s***
Don't watch it guys or else u will want to kill urself i am telling u. They say that a drowning man clutches at a straw. This is, in a lot of ways, comparable to the behind the scenes journey of this failing Spanish saga. Netflix became the saviour of this once packed up two part series. The reason I am saying this is because it is clearly evident why it was failing in the first place. The direction is mediocre at best. The illogical thrill portrayed in the entire four parts is far from an art piece, it is instead comparable to Dwayne Johnson movie at best. The terribly designed filler intimate scenes can be described as Laboured. The use of logic in the screenplay is similar to the use of water in the running of an IC engine. The actors have a lot to work upon their skill in order to match the level of increasing fame they have received over the years. In the end it looks like Netflix played a big gamble by buying the show, and looks like it paid off! It was good till season 1. As they said the plan was a masterpiece and 100% full proof. But very soon you will realize that the character are saying so just for the sake of it. No plan could ever be full proof and you will begin to notice the flaws. Even then it was good till season 2. But then enters Netflix, to cash in the good work done in first two seasons. Season 3 & 4 are just lame. Netflix completely ruined it. La Casa De Papel (aka Money Heist) was a masterpiece! Until Netflix took over and created Season 2 (Part III & IV).
Ending of Season 1 (Part I & II) was perfect, leaving audiences a bittersweet ending. But netflix ruined it by making a sequel and adding back stories from its original supposed to be good story. Look what happened to Riverdale - a total mess after the next few seasons. Please STOP...Just STOP making more seasons. I hope Part V would be the last. Watched all the four seasons and i felt it unnecessary to create season 3. When season 2 ended the best way possible. If the series ended with season 2. I would have given it a 10/10. You've heard of the difficult second album; here is prize example of the difficult second series or rather the second series that should never have been made. Everything that made both parts of series one so watchable and gripping is missing here. This goes from long boring scenes where nothing happens and there are sheaves of tedious and unnecessary dialogue to the absolutely ridiculous, Two of the men looking for a trained killer who has vowed to murder them are distracted because they are spending time discussing ex girlfriends. And then when the killer turns up four of the "heroes" fire off hundreds or probably even thousands of machine gun bullets directly at him from close range and he walks away. Maybe he had on body armour but on his legs?! The 4 stars I have awarded are 8 for series one, 0 for series two. All events are expected not as sophisticated as prison break I had high hopes when I started it but it was my biggest time waste it was like they didn't have good writers for more content thus they stretched 4 episodes into four seasons
I don't recommend it's same if you watch first episode and last you won't find any thing different Money Heist - La Casa de Papel is the perfect example about knowing the limits and setting goals. The first two seasons had plot holes, mistakes etc. but it was exciting to watch undoubtedly! It was one of the most thrilling shows and this was the absolute success! However, the next seasons did everything wrong just for views and of course money, marketing and commercial.. The same thing over and over again! It's just boring now.. Boooring! Though the story is quite different and intersting but....the screenplay is slow and sleepy.It is just another stupid overrated show on netflix I wish seasons 1-2 were listed separately. Season 1 and 2 were great, gripping and sorta realistic, enjoyed them a lot. But seasons 3 was a big dissapointment and season 4 was just milking a dead cow. Just turned into a big soap opera.
Season 1-2 9/10
Season 3-4 4/10 Started in season 1 and 2, the storyline was not always credible but twists very interest. As the storyline continues, in season 3 and 4 events are becoming to unrealistic. That is a pity Good but overrated. Sometimes very predictable and some times very unrealistic The first season was really good! But the 4th is just getting worst and bored, just the same of the same. Nothing new to the drama. I saw all four seasons but I was disappointed. it was incredibly monotonous. it is not possible for this to actually happen. This is probably a science fiction movie. four cycles and still not finish. Boring My expectations was very high but this season my moving very slow and this season was much showing personal relations , not much master minds except some !
Hopefully next season will be as per expectations It would ve been 2 episodes if the robbery was well-planned without any love/hero-act/careless plot.
Just like GoT, it also would ve been 5 eps if Ned believes what Ranger said.
Breaking Bad, 4 eps if Walter didnt take the cancer treatment and die because of it.
My point is, every writers wants to develop their own story with their own way to entertain us. So, give them some credit.
I rated based on characters development through episode not because the story doesn t proceed/go-along as your mind wants to. Its not bad and worth to watch but is higly overrated with the rating its shluldn't be more than 7,8. Like how is this serie 8,5 rating i dont get it It reminded me of those intrigues in the Spanish soap operas. If it would have been a good series, this detail should have been absent.
Trivial as a plot, nothing unexpected. There are many illogical things, some mistakes in the interpretation of the actors (maybe due to the script or the director).
The only thing I liked was the scenography. Dubbed makes all of the characters idiotic. Original language is much better This started as a pretty intriguing storyline - sort of like Inside Man or a larger Dog Day Afternoon but in order to stretch it out they killed the momentum of the narrative and then started making characters act in stupid ways just to keep the story going.
Because we spend so much more time with these actors, their weaknesses become glaring. Horrible overacting but the English voice dubs are as bad as the kind you would get in bad Kung fu movies of the 70's. I started watching this since there were some recommendations about it. Also quite interesting with a Spanish series. Fiorst sesaon starts out well with thge staging of a quite clever heist. Season two felt just too drawn out without adding any particular to the intrigue. Season three basically becomes a copy of first season, a new heist in a quite similar setting. It would have been much more interesting if the story had been much more around their lives as fugitives out in the world. After a while I lack complexity, and the characters are very shallow and stereotype. Overall acting is quite average, no real stars to shine. I kept watching all three seasons and was a little disappointed in the end. I had expected more. No sure if I will spend time in the next season (which I am quite sure they will make). The show and the idea in itself is very good.<br/><br/>but there are to many impasient and short sighted characters, and a little over the top drama.<br/><br/>could have been an amazing show. ... you should engage your critical and objective viewpoints regarding this over-blown series. It's easy to fall into the trap of it being a 'robin hood' type movie and maybe that was the intention of the writers. But it fails because the plot lines are ludicrous, it's full of holes, the acting is one-dimensional and, worst of all, one can't feel empathy, or even care, what happens to the characters. I've read some silly negative reviews so I've felt compelled to write something for those who can't decide whether to watch or not and who might have given too much importance to otherwise lacking negative reviews of the show here. <br/><br/>This show does not take itself seriously and that's its strongest point and that's why it's easy to forgive so many things that would be unforgivable if the show was made under pretense of a serious "perfect" heist of the century. if you expect such show you better skip this one - it's not for you - you'll be disappointed...most likely. <br/><br/>All the main characters are broken and vulnerable people with a number of personality quirks, they are really caricatures of the professional master criminals. You could say that the show to some extent in that aspect parodies the genre especially movies and shows made in the US. <br/><br/>There is no such thing as a perfect plan, it's human to err, it's human to love and fall in love, to sin and seek redemption. It's good when the show made in Spain gets soapy and adds some of that special Latin Telenovela flair to the suspense of the series. Well tempered melodramatic parts of the show work really well with playful cast who have obviously enjoyed themselves while on the set.<br/><br/>The music theme of the show "My life is going on" explains the crux of the narrative.
it's a love story wrapped in the heist inside The House of Paper. ;) Why there is a hype about this sitcom? Professor looks more like soap opera conductor. Too long and boring stories each character. Love and emotions of every character is not required to build the story. I kept the TV on and went to sleep after about 4-5 episodes. When I got up it was 9th episode and the heist plot has not moved an inch. Waste of time. I have absolutely no idea how this series can have a rating of 8.5/10. The whole of Spain must have rated it so high...or Netflix paid some critics...
It is senseless and let itself get lost. A professor assembles a crew to pull of a daring and most improbable heist. He is suppose to have gotten the best in the business, but judging from what is happening; it looks like he got them at an AA meeting. These guys must be the worst criminals ever...or maybe that's the standard in Spain. Anyway,if this is what Netflix calls a hit,then we are in for a big ride!!! I hope we never see season 5, please cancell this show, pleaseeeeee<br/><br/>This should be ended after season 2... season 4 is worse of GOT season 8.... I don't understand why this series so over hyped. Over emotions. Waste of time This series starts strong seasons 1 and 2 but they then took advantage of them to make other seasons but I am sorry they ruined it especially in season 4. The most important thing which was poor was the dialogue or "there was no dialogue at all". One of the most overrated things i have seen.I have only watched 2 seasons , in my opinion its a mediocre show with a lot of hype around it. This might have worked 10 years ago but now its outdated , So no plans to waste my time on the other 2 seasons.<br/><br/>1: To start with the show is very badly acted , characters have unnecessarily loud expressions. The only actor i could see working his role was berlin.<br/><br/>2: I am so happy that the police force is not as dumb in real life as it has been shown in the show.<br/><br/>3: Creative liberties, the sequences just keep getting more and more stupid and illogical.<br/><br/>4: very weak antagonist. Stupid police force and super naive hostages.<br/><br/>5: underdeveloped characters , show fails to justify whatever the characters are doing. There are no story arcs or layers to the characters. This TV show is ridiculous. I don't know how it get this rating. Great idea,but already in third episode completely ruined. Denver,act as a psyhatric giving money to hostage,explaining why she shouldn't get an abortion. That shot in the tigh and hostage pretending to be dead. Ridiculous. Denvers daddy sleeping in middle of raid. High profile negotiatior in middle of heist go home want to arrest her ex husband because he went out with his daughter,then sitting for hours in caffe while heist is going on. After five months of planning everybody acting like spoiled children without any professionalism. Totally amateuristic show. I gave up after fourth episode because is ridiculous. I think it could be the most overestimated series ever.
The first part - season 1, maybe season 2 also - were ok...ish, but now it's just lame and pure rubbish.
Chuck Norris's movies have the potential of being more realistic. I feel this is the most OVERRATED show on Netflix. People are comparing this to BREAKING BAD? Seriously? Damn you're missing a lot...BB was an excellent masterpiece. I enjoyed money heist as well, but it's a 6/10 or maybe 7/10 show it deserves nowhere near 8.5.
The idea of the heist is pretty good I'll give them that No doubt. Till season 2 it was great the casting the plot everything was just impressive. The first few episodes were fascinating and intriguing that's what got me hooked, but it drops after a few episodes. It gets stupid and just more stupid later.
And I see people comparing this to Breaking Bad No Not Even in Lifetime Mate. Those idiots have such bad taste. Money heist is a good one but not exceptional at least don't compare it with the Classic.
This is the kind of OK TV show that a lot of people think is great because haven't seen anything good then this. People who call it a masterpiece, please do understand the difference. It's not even near to becoming a masterpiece. People are just following the trend and don't understand how stupid it gets. In today's sea of series you need to be much more creative in order to get 8.5. I have no idea how these series are so highly rated, but if you are used to professionally done TV series you will get annoyed very fast with this one. A lot of gaps in the story. No movement. Professional robbers doing stupid mistakes.... and so on. If i had such annoying hostages i wouldn't want this hesit no more This series has quite a lot going for it. The problem is, it doesn't quite know what it wants to be.
A psychological heist- based thriller with in-depth characters or a character driven psychological heist based thriller.
It keeps switching from the tension of the unfolding heist to lingering almost pointless exchanges between characters that left this viewer confused and frustrated.
The sub-plot of cat and mouse between Raquel and 'the Professor was enticing and thrilling enough to keep me watching - up until the end of the first season.
Then the logic and plot became too ludicrous to bare.
After investing so much emotion into the success of the heist gang only to have it all predictably fall apart left me feeling empty and frustrated.
I was hoping this series wouldn't cop out to the cliché of 'crime doesn't pay', particularly after developing the characters on both sides of the law as morally ambiguous, but I was wrong.
Despite the slick production, innovative writing and some intriguing characters I was left with a feeling similar to extreme buyers remorse.
I wanted my time back and felt utterly dissatisfied. I am fan of movies and series that show facts that are so close to reality and its the first time i ever seen something like that. It was so beautiful because it has a lot of drama, agony, death, laugh and love. By my opinion it was so good as the Titanic and Jurassic park. If someone does not seen this yet i consider to see it. IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED IT YOUR MISSING OUT. greatest TV sho since 2017 For a theme that has been widely covered in movies and shows, Lacasa De Papel is refreshingly unique. Any fan of Prison break or shows of that ilk will enjoy the intricacies of the plot and the intensity of this show. Every show has its flaws, and while there are some unrealistic moments, it is still an enjoyable watch. <br/><br/>The acting was phenomenal, (big up to Pedro alonso for his part as Berlin) the plot was exciting and unpredictable and the action itself was thouroughly entertaining. 
This show had so many twists and turns that even in the episodes where not a lot was happening, I was on edge because there was just no way to tell what was going to happen next.<br/><br/>The reviews bashing this show are mostly about slight innaccuracies and minor plotholes, don't listen to them. Listen to me. Lacasa de papel is intense, emotional, and action packed. One of the top 3 shows I have watched for sure, and I generally don't enjoy movies/shows in other languages. <br/><br/>The only thing I would say is if you plan on watching this show, don't watch it English dubbed, it takes a lot away from the brilliant acting. Use English subtitles instead! Enjoy! Bella Caio! This film isn't match the real european law. and cops are really idiot, foolish and coward they are really weakness about solving case or any problem. And a detective woman is most idiot and fool also. we seen in every movie, woman police officer (detective, comissioner)and man police officer are arguing. so this is not quitely different and incisive movie. The plot could not be better. El profesor is the key of success in this serie. In addition, all characters were well developed through each episode. It is almost impossible to stop watching. Plot twists are frequently as important and real-life questions raised especially in last chapters. Definitely worth re-watching. Probably the most overrated TV series I've ever seen I almost never write reviews, but this show requires one. If you like intellectual suspense, this has to be the best show made in a very long time. The tension between the Professor and the Inspector, as low key as it is on the surface, becomes overwhelming. I found myself routing for both of them, though in truth probably more so for the Professor. It is difficult to convey just how good this show is without revealing too much. When the series finally ended it felt like I just had finished a hard sprint. I now am going to watch for anything with the same writers, directors, and actors. They clearly are an "A" team. My only suggestion for the writers and directors - you do not need so much skin in skin scenes or use of the "F" word. Both might be commonplace in hollywood, but the phrase "hollywood standards" is a term of derision most places outside hollywood. At most on a level with shows like Prison Break, rather below it.
There are just too many better shows than this to justify a 8.6, seriously. Such a nice surprise ! A great story, a suspenseful plot implacably unfolding, a lot of unexpected twists.
A lot has already been said on the acting, which is impeccable. But what's most remarkable is the writing, so inventive and clever.<br/><br/>I never thought that the story would keep being captivating for 13 episodes, but it did. And then some...<br/><br/>In the beginning, you think it would be wrapped up in 2 or 3 episodes, what more can they come up with?<br/><br/>But it never gets boring, not for a minute. 13 hours later, I'm under the spell!<br/><br/>Well done, y'all ! Seriously what's wrong with the high ratings...<br/><br/>I cannot digest ,the cheif inspector ,knowing who the professor is ,but still playing like a teenage girl misled with love, and despite knowing the hanger address is there even an Iota of logic why Angel ( After recovering from Coma ) and the inspector not telling the others about that..?<br/><br/>This series for some reason make a mockery of viewers and couldn't even understand why it is getting these high ratings. I was worried part 3 wouldn't be as good as parts 1 and 2 however I was happily surprised were the story went, showing how things can fall apart very quickly. The acting is great and the character flaws are realistic and enjoyable to watch, I can't wait for part 4 the only question is will I have any finger nails left due to the nerves of having to wait another year. Netflix paying the reviews. Waste of time. Unrealistic. I'm stunned at how bad this series is, from the outset it tries too hard to portray that 'cool' image of bank robbers, immortalising them into something they're not. First of all there's zero character development, its straight into the action, no planning, no build up, no suspense. Just straight through the front door all guns blazing, its a terrible plan that is so unbeliebable its literaly unwatchable. <br/><br/>Secondly there's the acting, its not just bad, its really bad, it doesn't help that the script is awful too, sounds like its written by the guy who didn't get the job at writing the first Rambo movie.<br/><br/>And finally the whole thing is filmed through a gritty filter, washed out colours, dark, moody, but it doesn't create the intended suspense its supposed to, its just annoying. I had to create an account just to vent at how bad this show is. Worst show I've ever seen on Netflix by a country mile. I felt obligated to leave a review after seeing the 8.8 rating on IMDB. this is a wannabe Oceans 11 that fails miserably. the plot is so fakey. season 1 is 13 episodes & nothing happens. save your time. almost every character is awful. the dialogue & character development is embarrassing. I really wanted to like this but it was impossible. Good idea but completely fails at execution. The script is flawed and completely unrealistic. If one is to believe the Spanish police doesn't have a clue how to shoot... After all the hype surrounding Cas de Papel, I decided to give it a try. I won't lie, at first I was hooked. The whole concept of this "impossible heist", the mysterious plan, the interesting characters and the tension gets you invested. But as the show progresses, the plot seems to start to drag, the show switches over it's focus from the actual heist, to the all the love stories going on. And trust me, there are a lot! Everyone of the characters seem to find the love of their life, all while casually robbing the Royal Mint of Spain. Even more, the heist-men suddenly shift from following the plan they had been preparing for 5 months, to not caring about it at all. Especially some of the heist-men's behavior just becomes irrational and childish. Don't get me wrong, I am willing to overlook some details in an action show, but this series requires you to switch off the logic in your brain in order to watch it after some point. For me, this show feels like the writers had a good idea, and then just didn't know where to go with it, ending up with a bucnch of cliches. Had nearly everything to be a top class show, but fails horribly in the details. Plot is twisted and retwisted beyond any credibility. Cops are just shown as a band of morons, affairs between hijackers and hostages are quite ridiculous (as is also the affair between the professor and ladycop). But, above all that, the girl who plays Tokyo is absolutely insulting. Her acting is soooo bad I ended up fast forwarding when sh was on screen. it is really insulting. The best series I have ever watched. All the actors rock 😍
Can't wait for the next seasonnnn!!! It has a good plot and all but on the other hand, it's got almost all known crime genre Cliché and it feels though the script is written so that they could fit in properly those clichés to fit the plot. I didn't feel any connection with the character and didn't care if they lived or died. it's too focused on Tokyo and doesn't let space to show the complexity of the other characters. too summer it all up, this show is just another crime show that tries to seem sophisticated and fails to do so. A way to pass time while exercising. The first few episodes drew me in but I find the characters unlikable as the story progresses. This series will stay on my mind for a long time! I couldn't stop watching it. 3 or more episodes per day! 
Respect! This has to be the most overrated show on Netflix. The story is ridiculous and the characters (minus one or two) are very unlikable and annoying.
A group of criminals who see each other as "family" and think they are the victims in all of it. They are murderers and thieves that act like they're innocent. Season 3 is the worst. So don't waste your time on this, the cops shoot at a burglar too only injure him " yeah right " Like in the movie wanted the bullet curves but only injures but still the burglar manages to kill his opponents. Overrated.. don't just go with ratings. Bunch of thieves can't keep it together to get the job done!.... Big robbery I am surprised to see that people are not happy with season 4. I've just forced myself to finish the first season and I have one question, could it get any worse?!
Low quality drama with hundreds of mistakes and stupid characters. I can write pages criticizing every aspect of this show, but I'll sum up by saying, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME! The 1st two seasons were really good but don't bother watching after S2 as it would affect ur overall impression of the show..after S2 there is nothing but gradual downhill of a good show....they dragged a perfect ending uselessly over and over...S4 is nothing but a season full of plotholes... watch at ur own risk...I suggest stopping after S2 of the 4 seasons!! I tried hard to fight back nausea, hoping to give it a chance. However the male characters are so unbearable,
You're hoping the couple females will go movie theater with automatic weapons and give male characters torture due to them for
grotesque behaviors. I generously skipped ahead to see if any improvements exist, but nope. Dont waste your time here. Season 1: 10/10
Season 2: 5/10
Season 3: 7/10<br/><br/>Starts with a brilliant idea, but it becomes a little boring. If you ask me, season 2 should not exists...season 3 was something different but it.s based on the same thing. Great character building. Original storyline and logical. Each of them are very well introduced without flaws and they compliment each other as a team. Every episode had such a wonderful balance, you can't predict their next moves. Well, im a big fan of spanish tv show now. Cant wait for the next season! Bella ciao I usually don't like non-fantasy themed series if they are not exceptionally good, but for this I made an exception since I've heard good things.<br/><br/>All I can say is that I'm glad I did. It's one of the best series I've watched in a while and for sure it's the best non-american series for me.<br/><br/>The cast is great, with great acting and the writing is incredible. You like most of the characters and you want to see what happens next for them. The concept is pretty simple but that's not bad. It's very realistic and it doesn't have many no-logic writing just to save the protagonists and that's always a plus for me.<br/><br/>Worth mentioning: For me, a good series needs to have good soundtracks and I'm happy to say that they have the right soundtrack for every scene, action-packed, emotional etc.<br/><br/>All in all, if you like the concept of a mastermind making chess like moves to win his opponent then you should give this a try. I won't give anything away but this is one to watch I binged the entire two seasons in a week each episode is better than the last my only tiny gripe is the English audio dubbed over the top but after a few episodes in you don't notice I can't wait for season 3 I usually don't see tv shows but this show has my all attention. What a show! What a performance by all starcast! I really mean it . Never seen such a mind-blowing fast paced heist drama. Epic! My congratulations to the whole team. Waiting for season 3! This is definitely up there with the best series ever. It's an absolute thriller; you're always on edge. I watched it all in one sitting as I couldn't get myself out of the couch Just came across the name of this series when I asked my cousins to give me few names for my eyes and brains to see and think.<br/><br/>It started slowly and accelerated like G_force that I continued seeing it for a whole night at a stretch, always thinking and trying to guess the twist. But in vein till the very end.<br/><br/>Acting was awesome specially by the professor and the berlin.<br/><br/>Over all very pleased, waiting for another name. 2 Stars because I found two of the characters likable. Both of them played the role of criminal. One was like a "Gus" from Breaking Bad. The criminal mastermind. The other, the most likable, was a narcissistic sociopath. He is described as having no empathy, but you, the viewer, will realize he's the only sane being in a world gone mad. You will feel his pain, i.e. you will empathize with the sociopath. <br/><br/>Every other character was pathetic and hackneyed, and completely inconsistent. 
 This gang of fools would change allegiances and principles on a dime, just to add discourse and plot twists. This made for frustrating viewing. The writers are not your friends. <br/><br/>I did finish the series to see how my two anti-heroes made out. Although, for the final 5 episodes I only watched about 5 out of 45 minutes each, just to advance the plot.<br/><br/>This is more than a review, this is a "self help" posting.
If you are really curious, and you want to give it a chance, here is my recommended execution:<br/><br/>1. Watch the first 4 episodes entirely. You will know the plot and all the characters. 
2. Spend about 15 minutes, each, on the following 3 episodes. At that point, you'll be ready for step #3.
2. Completely skip the next 14 episodes. The same things happen over and over again. Don't put yourself through it. 
3. For the grand finale, watch the last 15 minutes. It's so predictable, the plot is just weak, but the most irritating and frustrating part are caracters. They're completely onedimentional, stereotypical, which gives to the series the vibe of a chilidish game. I've hatewatched the first season and started the second one in hope I finally see what most of the reviewers saw. But I just can't stand it anymore...
The only positive aspect of it is that I could practice my Spanish a bit As other reviewers here, I was drawn in by the high rating. The initial idea had promise but from the start the English dubbing gave it a weird artificial tone. I gave it a few episodes to improve but it descended into absurd story lines and increasing poor acting. I, too, wonder if people have artificially inflated the ratings. By far one of the best show I have watched. I don't usually like foreign movies because the traduction is bad, but the actors are wonderful and the characters are wonderful. You root for them as the heist goes along, and definitely keeps you on the edge. It is more than just criminals, there is values, rules, morals and definitely sends a bigger message about who the real crooks are in the world. This is simply one of the best shows I have ever watched in this genre. 
Must see! Melhor impossível. Adorei tudo! Show....
Demais. 
Massa.
Top.
Único. The group of a actors is just amazing! Berlín makes me hate and love him at the same time, Nairobi makes me feel empowered, and Arturo makes me angry. I cried, laughed, celebrated, and cursed with them! Would highly reccomend. Addictive and binge-wortht. Very frustrating movie, following typical unrealistic storyline. Robbers have superhero strengths, all planned out, professor who is a martial arts ninja while the police is led by the most stupid and unprofessional inspector ever seen. She never is at the site of the robbery, only deals with personal problems, does everything on her own and is a cry baby. In real life, nobody would give such a person the responsability of chief inspector. Finally when she catches the professor and he walks away, why she doesnt shoot him in the foot. The actors playing Tokio and Nairobi are not bad but the storyline sucks. Police wouldnt stay on stand by if kidnappers behave so strange, dont have any demands, deal with explosives, start shootings with the police, let the dictators set all terms, and hostages start disappearing. Also hostages working that happily for the robbers while treated like dogs is not realistic. Also the idea that the public supports and has sympathy for the robbers is a lame idea. Its hard to watch but this movie sucks big time. Worst actor: The inspector Raquel. Stopped watching at some point. The story is innovative but the characters are just too much cliche for me. With a storyline based in the same environment for a very long time you've got to have deep and exciting characters to keep the viewers interested. That isn't the case unfortunately. My son recommended me to see this thriller series on Netflix. Each series is written very carefully with lot of intelligent details. I mean from the human and criminal side. The elements used in this story are put very clever together in a way you want never stop watching it. It offers lot of suspense, spectacle, high emotions and another dimension to understand the criminals who want sometimes justice for their undesperated situation. Finally you enjoy the great performance from all the actors. Congratulations to all and thank you for this unforgettable present. 
If you want to spend other entertaining moments don't miss the other legendary series Breaking Bad or Narcos.
My rating 10/10. This is a TV-show that pretends to be smart. It starts with a cool idea, it introduce the story in an entertaining way but then face the burden of character development and story telling.<br/><br/>This could have been an entertaining 5 episodes TV-show, instead it is a 15 episode mess followed by another season.<br/><br/>The show is filled of plot holes and illogical reactions. It also use cliffhangers in the most infuriating way. Almost each episode ends with a dramatic situation that is defused instantly at the next episode start. It gives the feeling that nothing important ever happens. Worst, if feels like the show think the public is stupid and forgiving.<br/><br/>On the other side the actors are doing very well and the direction is good too. The story is a total failure, I could not finish the two last episodes of season 1, even by skipping scene. Without giving much away, this is probably the best robbery thriller out there. Why it's better than most? For one, how detailed it is... typically USA show is alot of fluff/waste of time. This has psychological elements (what people will do/how will they react) to predict behavior, and create a plan based on that. It's blunt and true, Stockholm syndrome is real. <br/><br/>Acting may have been a bit over the top but I can hardly judge since I didn't hear it in original tongue.<br/><br/>Overall, enjoyable 20 hours, capped off by a great main theme song.<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>P.S I love netflix for buying quality shows in the world. Why waste money to overpay usa show runners, 99% of whom are not creative, when you can literary pick whatever you want from the world. I have finished watching all the episodes of La Casa de Papel in 2,5 days. The story is detailed, the acting is awesome, the music is excellent, I loved everything about it. It's an extremely good show which I believe, I will watch it for a few times more. I strongly advice you to watch it. And to add up. It is realistic, just based on intelligence and clever thoughts. If that's not enough, go watch a documentary or something, which I assure u it's 100% trueðŸ˜˜ So many wrote before me! There is a story about a door in Money Heist. A story that left me numb for hours. Something so powerful, so deep, so human, so poetic, that I pledged to follow all of it all.But that is most of it. I am frustrated by the fact that such a good idea was trusted in the hands of low grade students in cinema. Good actors do not save it. Nothing makes sense, nothing evolves naturally from the plot or characters, except for stupid acts, unrealistic arms handling, unrealistic fight scenes. It is as if the script is 30% written, 40% taken from Hollywood and the rest is left to fill the gap in order for the action to go on.Elite soldiers that cannot shoot at the target, everyone is driven by ego and hormones. The police is shown made of morons, with one woman exception, etc... Go for the door and stop there. I watched 7 episodes because people insisted this show was good, I kept giving it a chance until eventually I gave up on liking it. I think this show is for people that have not watched enough movies and quality series, it copies plots from everywhere, there is nothing original about it, maybe that it is in spanish? So predictable and boring. no thief would act like this. this is more a love story. typical heist movie without killing a hostage...better watch heat. How can it be this series has such high ratings?<br/><br/>It starts good but quite soon it drops to a very very long registration of the so called perfect heist which is everything but perfect... because....everyone is dumb as can be..<br/><br/>The police, swat members, intelligence, you name it. And that goes that deep that it's impossible to see this show as a serious story telling drama.<br/><br/>Acting is mediocre at best...Only 'Berlin' takes it away at times. The 'Professor' is really one of the worst character in the series.<br/><br/>Not very sure why there's a season 3 in the making... This is the best series I have seen awesome story good twist and turns,the professor was really smart you sort of routing for him I just watched the last episode, and i feel a bit speechless. This is a series with twist and turns, and you never know if the professor has planned the events or if it just goes horrible wrong. <br/><br/>Slowly we are brought in to the plan, and how it became. And learn more and more about these robbers. And what a ride it is.<br/><br/>I would recommend watching it in the orginal language, because the dubbing is horrible. I dont understand a word they are saying, but its great. (Its texted) The dubbed voices seem like they did not grab the essence of the series, and just seem off. You can do better NETFLIX! Disgrace to this awesome series.<br/><br/>Series: 10/10 
English dub: 0/10 You might have seen the name on your Netflix or heard people talking about it but weren't sure if it is for you. Stop hesitating and start watching!! It is a bomb from the first 10 minutes...the plot evolves every episode and keeps you hungry for more. Basically, Season 1 of Prison Break intesnity but in Spanish but these guys are robbing a money printing reserve. Oh yeah, to have a complete experience por favor watch it in SPANISH and not dubbed.<br/><br/>Absolutely stunning, now I will be monitoring Spanish Tv Shows for smth else Absolute waste of time. One of the most naive shows I have ever seen. Seasons 1 & 2 are brilliant. OK some over the top exaggerations did exist - particularly where Tokyo re-enters the bank - but let's surpass that.<br/><br/>Season 3 is mediocre, at best. Things just don't make sense - in numerous times. Acting is pathetic (Tokyo & Rio especially). And in general, there's a steep downfall to the series overall quality.<br/><br/>Beings honest I have only watched the first 3 episodes, and do not intend (not i am able) to see the rest. Script - 10/10
Direction - 10/10
Acting - 10/10
Been a while since I have seen a story so gripping.... i think the last was Breaking Bad that got me hooked. Amazing cast and superior screenplay/direction. after seeing this, i HAVE TO learn espanyol :-) The first 13 episode was extreamly good, but the last 6 was the oposit. its ok, the first part has some big mistake<br/><br/>spoiler<br/><br/>like the professor portrait scene with the russian, but the serial is good, i give a chance and was unstoppable to watch an other episode.<br/><br/>but the last 6 episode is just annoying. drama, drama, drama, the jokes are missing, the pro robbers become amateurs. the episodes become lame, like all the convesations. talk talk talk, but nothing interesting. <br/><br/>poor serial. :(
li Seriously there is nothing much to write about this series , but season 4 is something different as it is the biggest joke i have ever watched !! No way i still can not believe how they are gonna produce more seasons of this trash show . It is like dump and dumper are off to make a heist. Since long time, I noticed that Netflix tv show has high good rating here , but i said it's a different opinion, but after this show i'm sure that most rating is fake.. so don't depend on it. The writing on this is incredible, every episode ends with something awesome and makes you want to watch the next one. That's how you write a serie the right way. Rolls out just like the best series Hollywood ever made.<br/><br/>The emotions are felt throughout and backed with a strong soundtrack (even more in part 2 with some traits of Interstellar thrown in the mix).<br/><br/>Only negatives I found which is why I give it a 9 , is that the second part is 6 episodes and the end as good as it is, is rushed a lot. They could have done a 7th episode easily. Also , there is almost zero characted background in the serie except in episode 1 . Finally, a certain hostage which you would think would be a key hostage for the whole serie , become pretty much useless after the first half of part 1.<br/><br/>However, the serie have so much positives, that I just thought about these at the end of all of it with a huge smile on my face Some tv shows are terrible and you just dont watch them. This one mixed in some good parts forcing the viewer on an endless journy of good and bad. My theory is they had 2 seasons and washed it down to make 4 seasons, full of flashbacks and endless collages. This pandemic lockdown has hyped this series from nowhere. Eventhough the series stays true to it's genre it is only a watchable series.
The hyped out guys should consider watching Sherlock, Prison Break like shows to understand how over-rated this series is.
Also I stopped watching after season 2. If I die in battle, leave me here. Great story! Therefore, the state machinery serves the ruling class, and the rules are set by them. I've watched 2 episodes and I can barely make it to episode 3. It's THAT boring. And I live in Europe, where this show is supposedly popular (according to Wikipedia).
I don't understand the hype around this show.
Too bad, because the narration in the first episode was interesting, as well as the story. The show runners seem to be trying hard to add every usual element of your average group heist series/film, To mention a few: the extremely smart mastermind who plans everything ahead of time and foresees all possible scenarios and problems (same person also turns into a martial arts expert or an assassin, or a lover boy when necessary), the psychopathic group leader, the tough guy, etc. The problem is this team that the supreme leader gathers is so incompetent and unprofessional that a month long heist starts to go south on day one! And not for the right reasons too!
On the other team, there is this super police captain who is so weak and incompetent she seems to spend more time solving her issues and fixing her own mess rather than focusing on a heist that caught the attention of the nation!<br/><br/>Enjoyed a couple of laughs watching season 1, but that's it for me! The series well written but it seems to support he dark side, plot showing robbers and criminals as the good people defending them This is the most addicting series i have ever come across. If anyone has a slightest of interest in Suspense/Thriller/Crime then this is a go-gun for you. This series deserves everything appreciation and recognition If you think doing bad is good for you then you will like this ,, World is already filled with bad thing and you showing bad as good ,, please think which side are you ??? ,,, below comment copied from some one, and its true .
These guys call themselves revolutionaries, but all they did is to rob banks and live a luxurious life with the money they stole from state, Real REVOLUTIONARIES are people who put their life at risk for the opposed and poor, these guys are not revolutionaries, they are just murderers and bank robbers. And this show is just over glorification of crime and bank robbers Season 4 is very slow and disappointing. Writer could have done a better job. Season 1 was good and somehow plausible, but I pushed myself to finish season 2; and I'm absolutely not going to watch the rest as the writer/writers insult their audience by considering them gullible and/or action-junkie imbeciles! The following is just a few instances of what's wrong with the series:<br/><br/>1. Abusing the song Bella Ciao to glorify a bunch of murderers and criminals as heros! Partisans fought for their country, its people and freedom, they didn't fight for their personal gain/money, they didn't take innocent people as hostages and mentally (and quite often in the series, physically) torture them!
2. Raquel was supposed to be the best chief of police in Spain and yet she was too stupid to take the guy somewhere out of the town to interrogate rather than arresting him right away! She was also too weak of a character to shoot him when she was given a second chance -in the legs, for instance- and let him drive off in her own car!
3. Angel lost his faith in the system in just less than 5 minutes? Monica risked her own and others' only chance of freedom over a stupid crush? What was the significance of the scene Nairobi boosting Alison's confidence when she was a passive hostage throughout S1&2 and not showing any courage? Was that merely a filler, like many other unnecessary scenes?
4. Is the Spanish police force this incompetent, for real?! They couldn't shoot Tokyo's motorcycle all the way she was driving through!
5. The police had several opportunities to infiltrate through the ceiling without breaking a glass or making any noise (e.g. cutting the glass at night like in Mission Impossible movies); even during multiple occasions of noisy exchanges and events when the heisters were distracted! 2-3 rangers could take down 5 criminals, especially if finished them quietly and separately (as they were scattered across the place most often), given that Oslo and Moscow were down, or when Oslo was gone and Tokyo under their custody.
Moreover, the characters are not charismatic and definitely not loveable! Do the writers seriously expect people to root for/relate to any of them? To call this a "masterpiece" your EQ must be lower than -10^100 Why did they create a masterpiece just to ruin it by stalling in season 4, money is the answer. It's obvious that they filled up 4 episodes chasing Gandia with one goal, to extend to a fifth season.. No more views money heist we resist... The entire season is rubbish, ridiculous and full of cliches and copies of bad American films.
Some characters are unnecessary like most of the scenes.
Basically is just horrible and underestimate my intelligence. I am constantly imagining the faces of producers and directors in Hollywood, wondering why they haven't been able to get such a format of this quality in recent years. Most probable solution: soon we will be served a more wanted than skilful imitation à la Hollywood. It is like many other series ....too much power to one man than anyone else too many coincidences n too much ignorance to facts .....nothing to must watch. By the end of season 2 I would have given the series 10/10, now that I got to season 4 it dropped so damn much I'm almost sad I didn't stop at 2. There are some illogical situations, what was amazing in previous seasons is horrible in season 3 and 4. Just stop before you make it worse, this was completely unnecessary. 8 episodes and literally one would have done, and it didn't conclude, so I assume is back for a Part 5.
Lets hope that the writers get some inspiration during lick down that will bring it back to its former glory I think money heist got extremely high numbers of fans from Pakistan. Love it we all do lots of love from Pakistan Tokyo is so overrated and pathetic acting, the rest of the cast are so awesome. The first season is ok, fun at some points, so you almost forget all the bad.
Maybe if the show was shorter it could be rated 5/6.<br/><br/>Episodes after episodes, the action is replaced by a soap-like melo-drama, where the life and feelings of the protagonists are more important than the heist.<br/><br/>You are lead to think that the robbers are deep interestng people, but the artificial chaos created around them and their illogical and irresponsible reaction to that only makes all of them fools and unprofessional.<br/><br/>What they try to tell you:
<ul><li>Profesional robbers with high expertise</li><li>Perfect plan that anticipate everything</li></ul><br/><br/>What you actually have:
<ul><li>Unprofesional robbers that act like teenagers and can't handle any contrariety</li><li>Plot holes with inconsistant behaviors, reactions and situations</li></ul> While some of the technical genius of the robbers is very interesting, the series just drags on and on and on. You see flashback or robbers you don't care for as they all have their broken down issues. Amazingly stupid to think their plan was going to work. Then we have the inept police. For a long time, they kept shooting and hit no one (ok, they finally hit a robber in a later episode). But, the viewer has to be brain dead to take this all in. The lead detective falls in love with the lead robber, all kinds of mistakes by police are made, lead detective finally figures it out and captures the mastermind at gunpoint. Does she call her police allies and come and take him off to jail? Nope. She takes him to the old hideout, interrogates him, and ultimately lets him escape. How stupid is that? I found myself screaming at the TV to her. I have not finished the whole series yet, but I am ready to shut it off if they don't get through that tunnel and escape pretty soon. It goes on, and on, and on! zzzzzzzz Thumbs up if you watch Season 3 finale shaking in your seat! Wow!! Well done! The professor met his match! I binge watched the first two seasons over a course of two days. It was fun, entertaining, stylish, clever and with some quite likeable characters. It wasn't perfect and had plenty of flaws but it made for great watching and the cliffhanger episodes made me watch "just one more" when I should probably have been sleeping. I really liked this show. It really was fun. But it should have ended there. Sadly it did not.<br/><br/>Enter season 3. I don't know if the writers and director of the original got replaced, or simply lost the plot, but I didn't make it past episode 4. And that was 2 too many.
I will try to block out ever seeing them so I still can fondly remember the first 2 great seasons.<br/><br/>3 comes across like a cheap fan made spinoff, created by an angsty 15 year old antifa kid who really really really wants to be in with the Kool Kids at anonymous, and is an outspoken feminist in order to impress girls and get laid. The stylishness of first has been totally replaced by cheezyness, the once likeable characters feel forced and are annoying, and any realism and grittiness has given way to absurdity.<br/><br/>Nope. Season 3 never happened. Do yourself a favor and pretend it doesn't exist.
9/10 for the very entertaining first two seasons. I loved this show so much. It was the first non English show I watched and was amazing there is nothing like this.
If your not Spanish I recommend not watching it with English dub because it's not good at all so watch it in Spanish with English subtitles.
Other than that it's AMAZING INCRÍBLE. Started off as a brilliant thriller but lost it's course after few episodes in series 1.
The script makes the characters so stupid or dumb and some plots are so unbelievable. I had to stop watching and turn BBC news on which had more gusto. If this was one season show it would be one of the greatest i watched, but no they will make a 5-6 season show pushing the story that dont make sense at all, thhey already killed it. My prediction is that it will face cancelation soon. The series starts off really strong but then there is too much drama which drags the story. Major loopholes like a person who is the chief negotiator would not have the time or desire to go out for dates while the hostage situation is still ongoing.<br/><br/>The only enjoyable scenes are where the actual heist is happening or the professor is negotiating/explaining his plan.<br/><br/>The only way I could finish this was to fast forward thru all the emotional relationship stuff which had no bearing on the story and is a waste of time. It is one of the best series in the world. Great storyline and acting. once you start to watch it, you can't stop. you can't sleep without knowing what's next. If you really want to have a good time, go for it. Without doubt one of the best tv shows of all time. I have watched all 3 seasons in 4 days. I feel exhausted with so much excitement.
Cannot wait for season 4 I loveee this show, is been a while since I've watched something this good, but la casa de papel has made it. The actors are mind blowing, i just cant get enough words to describe how good the show is. You should watch it. I create Imdb account only for La casa de papel rating.
If you not watch it then you missed so much in his life.
Just go and watch now dont waste time.
I watch it 100th of times. I loved the First season, so many likeable roles and actors, loved the idea behind the heist it was really fun to watch. The second season was good, but the third season... fk Hollywood. The music, the actors, the camera work, how everything was put into scene, the pace even those filler Dialoges between the roles, was just awesome for me. Why im so raving about the third season? When i Read there will be a third installment, my First reaction was... oh man come on please, stop trying to milk a dead cow, its hopeless. But everything was put a on a whole new Level compared to the last season, I even laughed. 50kg artichoke, no one needs them. I just finished season 3 and I'm amazed at how good this show is! Must watch! GREAT!!! Probably one of the best Netflix series I have seen so far.
With its unpredictable and overwhelming plot, this series so addictive that one will definitely complete it in binge watch. The series revolves around a very strong, mysterious, genius yet very kind man name Sergio Martinez(The Professor) who spends half of his life planning the biggest robbery in the history with a very dangerous but capable crew. Despite facing all the problems in the way he and his crew somehow able to get away with around 1 billion euros in cash without leaving any trail.
Talking about the cinematography of the series, it looks very cool. I mean the producer Alex Pina and team has done a really good job creating a tense environment which suits the storyline of the series. All the actors have done a fine job with their characters. No doubt about that. The series is mostly shot in Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) headquarters(called as The Royal Mint in the series.)
In my opinion, if you love watching crime movies and series, then you should not skip this one. No way! This is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED SERIES.<br/><br/>Thank you! From their City Names to trying to save each and everyone's life, every frame is thought into very detail. The Professor Character is very Strong , even the women characters right from the scratch to very end... They devoloped thier characters very well... And Andres de Fonollosa aka Berlin is the best... The way professor plays the game with police is Mind Blowing... Gripping, Thrilling, Everything fits into this Series... 10/10 I would take a bow to the person who thought of this story! This is a brilliant series, you will not be able to think what next is coming. One of the best series in the world. This is an amazing and exciting series. It's wonderful to see the actors playing so well. I love heist and robbery movies or series so I've enjoyed this one a lot. I liked even the end that in a lot of series the wordt part is the end bcause they don't know how to end it. This is the best show I've seen lately. Good unpredictable storyline, great actors, plot twist,excitment, action, in one word - masterpiece. You will enjoy in every minute of this show. Great drama with a mix of humour, action and suspense. Hooked from the start and loved both Part 1 & 2 .. very binge worthy :)
This has introduced me to Spanish culture and a cast of who are super sexy and great character actors. Left me wanting more ... can't wait for the much rumoured Season / Part 3. Bravo! I must admit this might be the second Spanish show I ever watched... I can see a good reason why this won an Emmy... The characters are superb, the story is intense and overall drama and action keeps you hooked on this until you need to go to sleep... All of this with a touch of Spanish spirit... A few shows come to my mind which would be as bold innovative and work on your mind like a dose of cocaine... This one is something like a mix of Experiment 2, Lost, Prison Break and Death Note...
You have that main mastermind Yagami Light style guy which constantly plays a game against a police detective... You have a bunch of characters which ended up in a situation where they need to learn to work with each other Lost style... And you have all of the Drama of Experiment2 and Action of the Prison Break... Bravo my Spanish friends, the world indeed will talk and remember you as heroes ... Lucid, simple, honest, intilegent!!!
It has some weak moment, but in all amazing TV show!! I bet u will admire the guy who wrote screenplay he needs an award! Actors are fantastic, the professor and Berlin still the show! I have watched all season 1 and most of season 2 so far. Its nice change from the usual US serials, with a nice story reminding me of Ocean 11. The key element of the serial is the mind battle between the organizer of the heist and the police. Directing and Photography is very good. The scenario has a few flaws but that does not take away any of the its entertainment value. As for acting, its quite decent, some better than the rest<br/><br/>I would recommend it based on what I have seen so far. I am a bit sceptical of the extra season that Netflix will produce, since this is a heist, how much can you drag it till its resolved one way or the other. Enjoy! Yes it ranks high up at the same level as Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones. It's gripping and doesn't let you down for one second from beginning to end. I was sad to see it end. They say there might be a sequel in 2019. Let's see. One thing I found disturbing is that IMDB had no timely updates and reviews! Why is that? It's one of the most acclaimed TV series internationally. Even until today, not all episodes are registered adequately. Please fix that for the records. Good show for an average viewer who doesnt pay atention to details and waches the picture as a whole..
The story is great and had potential but they ruined it with silly descisions and unreal situations,like swat teams having 0 accuracy,police being realy dumb,silly situations all over the place that make 0 sense,made both by kidnapers and hostages :)
Main characters are lacking,Berlin killed it tho,props to him!..Profesor was decent,Father and son were both amusing,they brought raw emotion to the show,but the rest were meh,especialy Rio and Tokyo,oh boy,those 2 ruined the show halfway for me,especialy Tokyo,character with no point basicly but to be a sexy bad ass female,going around acting like a 13 y old girl on a period..and that motor bike scene almost made me quit waching the show lol
If the director used the power of logic,for example,if 10 police offficers are shoting auto rifles a bullet is bound to hit something,i mean they had years and years of training,or say,hey that person has a brain,no way hed think and do something as stupid and ilogical as that..
Or for example give more air time to Berlin and not focus on the "love story" and feminist bad ass super cool but constantly on her period Tokyo the show could have been 10/10 To be honest, i've expected so much when i watched the very first scenes.I imagined to see those pro experts criminals run a genius robbery plan. But it all fell down since Tokyo's appearance.
This show absolutely have so many unlogical flaws like there're many scenes that we can't see any members watch on the hostages (??) The fool of some member (Tokyo & Rio, somestimes Denver) make us feel very disappointed and annoying.
But on the other side, i have to say i love this show. Why? Because i love Berlin's consciousness, professional and super cool attitude of Nairobi (You don't know how much i love her!), the brilliance of Professor's genius head and i feel so pity for the inspector Raquel.<br/><br/>So with this show, i still annoy with stupidity of Tokyo & Rio (I sympathize for Tokyo cause she's iconic in commercial side) but i also thrill to see what will happen next. I do see many flaws but yet i still love this show. One of the most addictive shows on Netflix. Script and acting are impressive. Briliant work by everyone who is in this series! I can't get enough! I give them all the awards!
O bella ciao, bella ciao, bella ciao, ciao, ciao! Most amazing, exciting and gripping rolar coaster of a money heist ever. My favourite programme and the best I've ever watched. Even repeated the whole thing, just can't get over how good it was! It has all the ingredientes a powerfull unique serie must have.i just couldn't Stop watching. Its is a combination of two (favourites) series. The ''Prison Break'' and the ''How To Get Away With Murder''. I strongly recomment '' La Casa De Papel '' because I believe that it has a lot of things to say, and it is not about '' a simple robbery ''. <br/><br/>*Sorry about my grammatical errors! If there is anyone in these review sections giving a negetive comments they are mentally disturbed, this show is a MASTERPIECE, the actors were incredible the whole plot from the training for the hiest to the mountains of emotions involved no other word to describe it absolute genius, definitely recommend. Am amazed!!! What a series!! Just wooooow perfecto Just that. Best series ever, recommended to everyone, you won't regret it! La Casa de Papel is my favorite serie from Netflix. Congrats for all the good work! La Casa de Papel is my favorite serie from Netflix. Congrats for all the good work. I watched it with my husband and we love it! We saw in Spanish and the only problem was the accent, very different from the one that we are familiar as we live in Chile. Waiting for the third season!! This i what i call. A damn good tv series ............ xxxxxxxx So many whining about plot, blabla. It's a show, it's fast, funny and well acted. I really enjoyed this one and found it one of the best series i have seen. If you cannot watch tv without doubting every single piece of the script, why watching tv anyway? It's entertainment, what do you expect? Go watch discovery or something. Eine tolle Geschichte! Unterhaltsam, dynamisch und schön. It's just a fantastic work .. i'll wait the third season to see it .. really the best work coming after the best for ever Game of thrones .. really nice work netflix wish u the best for ever Video clip artistically, Mamet script and a huge critic of Europe's financial crisis wrapped in a series about a heist of a robbery! Great acting by many! A very good tv show that keep you in the front of screen from the beginning to the end Masterfully...the cast...the screenplay...the plot..!!! Absolutely amazing series......looking forward for season 3. Actors have played an excellent role.
especially Berlin. He has given the serie a special touch. Let him please return in season 2. That he is dead is not really sure yet. Doors can still be open to his return.
The story is simply good and exciting. If you start with the serie you want to finish the complete story in 1 time.<br/><br/>Hats off for the Spaniards. Excellent work. The best tv series I've ever seen. The action and special effects cause the goose bumps non stop. It was a bit getting used to to watch a Tv show that was spoken in Spanish but after a few episodes you are hooked and can't stop watching!! The series is enormously exciting! Perfect cliffhangers. I watched it within the blink of an eye. Although, the conversations between the characters, which are in love, seem to repeat over and over again, which is - sorry 'bout that - quite annoying. It's therefore the only negative aspect, I can report. The rest is purely fantastic: The idea, the acting, the directing, the visualization... I will keep this short but i made an account on imdb just so i can review this series. Truly amazing. So nerve wrecking that i found myself biting my nails through most episodes. A must see. Bella ciao :) Sorry to disappoint some, but I am not sponsored by Netflix (maybe the will now ?). 
I have found he series to be absolutely thrilling and entertaining. With a cleverly built script that gives you the adequate dose of new pieces of the plan every chapter and while keeps it being coherent.
Not a 10 to me because I found the love affairs and 'political' parallel threads too predictable. 
But it still is truly entertaining! Extremely intense show, will keep you on edge for that next episode. All actors are fully immersed into character, some you would hate and that's the beauty of a great actor, some you would sympathize with. 
The plot is just some robbery but the way it has been portrayed, played, written and directed will simply blow your mind.
The series deserves a 9/10. I made an IMDB account just to review this show. An exciting, action packed, nail biting thriller, with juicy twists and turns throughout the plot. Was not expecting such an addictive show from the outset. This show is definitely best watched in original Spanish. It has incredible character diversity, depth and development, with the casting being spot on. Critiques in an excellent manner the over-arching divide between the people and authority, and what drives people to take certain actions. If you want a tv series that you can't stop watching, this it. You won't regret it <br/><br/>Bella ciao, ciao, ciao! What got me in the first time. Most people spend a lifetime to have a good payed job. So what about a half year to spend on the perfect robbery to make millions. After I have seen the 1'st I couldn't stop. I only stopped because I didn't want it to end. I hope this gets more attention, as it definitely deserves it. I admit there was some cliché and a couple of plot holes (shoot the tired, and aim before you shoot.) but i feel like everything that happends in the show is so masterfully woven into the plot that it all just comes together as a masterpiece. Not only is the show (actors, plot , writing and setup) perfect, but the philosophy behind the show is also so thought provoking. No puedes dejar de verla, capitulo tras capitulo y no paras.Totalmente recomedada! Everything about this show is bland and cliche. The show started with a nice idea but the execution is so bad feels like 3 years old wrote the script.<br/><br/>The main cast of characters was at first introduced as pro thieves and later they turn out to be bunch mindless amateurs... the police are even worse the dumbest police u can find in any tv show.<br/><br/>Oh and the romance is so bad and stupid... 100% cringe material<br/><br/>Finally to finish on a good note i guess ... the only thing i liked is Berlin<br/><br/>3.5/10 The series definitely kept me entertained though I had to suspend my disbelief in some parts to keep on watching as the plot relies heavily on "luck" and some of the characters' disposition or willingness to put emotion over logic/reason. Even the Police were too emotional when they were supposed to be level headed. Some may call that "being human" and this may actually have something to do with the Spanish culture which I am not that familiar with, so possibly didn't get to appreciate, but rather found it annoying. Having said that, all the characters are likable and it is a good solid drama that will keep you guessing in some parts. Slickly sexy Spanish crime drama La Casa de papel is by far and a way an absolute show stealer. I can not think of anything i have seen that comes close to this series. Its so polished its downright blinding.<br/><br/>The first season cleverly blends a highly original and detailed tale of theft on a grand scale with sophisticated, deeply personal, character development, colourful narrative, lots of guns and sex. <br/><br/>interestingly too for all the action to be found in this series, which include a couple of pretty decent gun fights, there is not a lot of true violence. Indeed, given the setting of this series, the body count is pretty low. Not an easy thing to do but to be honest this series feels "lighter" and more enjoyable for it. A refreshing departure from the blood soaked crime drama's coming out of the US in particular. <br/><br/>I devoured the first season almost in one sitting and was left wanting much much, more. The Spanish have managed to set a new benchmark for crime drama everyone else should aspire to. 10/10 from me. I recommand this serie for every single one it's one of the greatest things that i ever watched how the characters were chosen and the story is great MAGNIFICO I only managed to watch the first five episodes. The plot seemed to be intriguing and I must say I liked it for the initial 20 minutes. Then it went downhill. I realised that it has A LOT of similarities with Inside Man, a quite good movie. But the characters are plain dumb. The dialogues even dumber. The interactions between robbers and hostages are a joke. It starts off promising and you kind of believe that you are about to watch an uprecedented heist. But it is everything BUT clever. And please, somebody answer an honest question: who is being kept hostage and asks for an abortion pill?? I mean please. Sorry, not worth my time. Cannot imagine what the hype was all about! This serie has seen a lot of twists. The scÃ©nario is inspired by other histories but not copy identical. The ideas are good but production is less. The serie know a lot of suspense This is one of the worst highly rated shows ever.
It is full of plotholes and stupid decisions from the characters, if you want to watch a clever show, this is not it!
The plot seems interesting, initially, but the further you watch the dumber it gets.
Season 3 is a bit better but the whole series is not worth your time if you are looking for a quality TV show.
Sometimes it is so dumb, I wishI didn't watch any of it!
How is the ratingabove 8 is beyond me!?
A lot of people have their standards these days very low it seems! So when I started watching in the first moment I was in shock of how good it was and now with season 3 I was so shocked, like everything was perfect, in any moment I was like "that was boring or they should have put that" I was perfect, I watched in 1 day and I can't wait for the next season NÃ£o faz sentido algum a histÃ³ria desta sÃ©rie.
Trata se de uma trampa This was truly paiful to watch and I was struggling to even finish it. This is my first ever review.
when i was watching the trailer i did not think i would like this series at all.
But after i had watched the first episode i fell in love. It gets more and more exiting by every episode that goes and you cant stop watching because you just want to know what will happen. I heard from different people that this would've been a very good series. The moment I got sick for a week I started to watch this series. And couldn't stop watching it. I got through every single episode of the first two season in just a week, which is very fast for me, since I'm bored very fast.<br/><br/>It's not a 10 for me, but it is close to a 10! Wow!
Where did that came from? Totally unexpected, exciting, thrilling and yet full of action, smart but grounded and realistic series.<br/><br/>I drank it all in 4 days. All two seasons and in one word: overwhelming. <br/><br/>Totally recommended! The title says exactly that. Just get the robbery done and go. I don't care to see a bunch of nude and sex scenes. I fast forward through so much stuff. I couldn't wait until the end. Thank God. They all got away, the end. I just gave up on this one, the character interactions were too forced and the character back stories just didn't make sense. Most of the show your waiting for something to happen but they just keep cramming sex into the story, or start copying other movies plot lines like "inside man (2006)". Seems like any international movie/series project now gets high reviews for the sake of being international or something... if it's garbage it's garbage no matter where it comes from. Painful to watch
This show is just awful and bad
I didn't like itðŸ¤¢ In retrospect, it would have been merciful to have the lady inspector and the mint manager eliminated very early in the story, followed closely by all the other misfit characters that populate this travesty. Other than that, it was OK. What's up with Netflix movies lately?! The actors words don't even match their mouth's. It's just unwatchable. First I will talk about how the show is being represented, then about the actual problem that bothers me.<br/><br/>I was pretty impressed by the script, the story it's captivating and this is why i continued to watch it. BUT it's poor acting, the actors tend to alternate between european realistic style and
adolescent style. The transition between this two didn't go well at all. This series becomes pretty clichÃ©s, adding a lot of references about past movies, that will never go well. The acting haven't reached the real emotions that characters should have had.<br/><br/>Now comes my big problem, how the tv series reached to people. The show wants to represent a tribute to partisan and the connection between it and public come with the song "bella ciao". In my country, now, everyone wants to take part of "resistance", the conception of all resembling a superficial layer of understanding, they pretend to understand some aspects about what happened, although actors are quite reluctant about data exposure.<br/><br/>One final idea, the acting, that is very attractive and easy, makes the public to feel that they understood the story, making them feel special. Start forom the season one withe a great idea end to session two withe a great end The show revolves around a stupid mastermind professor along with his dumb apprentices. And dumber police forces. I love action thrillers. After watching the first two episodes, I shared the link with my friends who are also in this social distance lockdown. A few more episodes, I had to with you recommendation. As another reviewer had pointed out, this is a soap opera set in the name of heists. I finished all four parts on the treadmill, that's what this show is good for. First of all, I like spanish movies, heist based dramas, and themes based on people's revolution or resistance against the government, e.t.c, as long as the creators treat the audience's sensibilities with some level of respect and intelligence. That is not the case with La Casa de Papel. And for all the people who weirdly think that Season 1 and 2 were brilliant but only Season 3 and 4 ruined the show, let me tell you one thing - all 4 seasons were as dumb as anything I've ever seen.
Here is what we have - Robbers on a heist printing their own money in the bank, Robbers stealing the national gold reserves from the bank, Public loves the robbers and consider them heroes (oh boy !!), Robbers fall in love with hostages, hostages make love to robbers, robbers make love to robbers, Hostages become robbers, Chief of police investigating the case falls for the robbers leader's charms and decides to run away with him, becoming a fugitive herself (boy oh boy !!), Police teams with an IQ of a high school student are made to handle the case in all 4 seasons, and every battle won by the robbers against the dumb police is portrayed as a "larger than life, world-class" victory. I got sick and tired with the nonsense after Season 1 and through half of Season 2, and the only reason I kept watching Season 3 and 4 was to see whether there might be any tiny iota of intelligence and maturity from the police team (which would've calmed my nerves a bit !!), but sadly NO. I gave a 3 star rating only for Najwa Nimri (although her presence was only in few episodes of Season 3 and 4). If not for her, I would've rated a 1 star.
Spare yourself from this nonsensical money heist show which insults the audience's sensibilities. If you really want to watch action and adrenaline, which is atleast sensible and realistic, and treats the audience as someone with above average IQ levels, watch the series "Fauda" en Netflix, which is the story of undercover agents in Israel and Palestine, depicting the conflicts and on-going crisis between Israel and Palestine. When yiu have free time, go watch other movies.<br/><br/>The first two seasons was nice and interesting. But this goddamn Tokyo, Rio, and Raquel just makes me wanna puke. I pity the actor and actress playing them in the third season. They probably ruined their careers. Absolute disastrous of screen writing that does not sense of relevancy to ita viewers. I watched the first season to please my daughter and have never in all my years seen a more ridiculous piece of contrived nonsense masquerading as entertainment. Maybe it's just me because a lot of people seem to be enjoying it so good luck to them! Same thing that is repeating in every episode just overrated i regret watching it Perfect!!!
I recommend it to everyone.
Hope it never ends. What a show !!!! What a show !!!! Just loved every piece of it !!!! A great Storytelling.... editing... direction...bgm and superb soundtrack Forced to watch after all the hype from friends and social media and all it took was one episode to say how pathetic the show will be, I'm really glad that I stopped after one episode, point is it didn't intrigue me enough to even continue to next episode. People who are giving unnecessary hype to this show might have never watched an actual heist movie/series or settling for too less quality content.... don't waste time on this there are fantastic series like breaking bad, better call Saul, got and people who have no taste and like this show I just pity them ðŸ˜‚ Don't go with the reviews and save yourself some time to watch something worthy. It's an overrated debacle and storyline defies logic. First few episodes are watchable but later you begin to think why police is made to appear so dumb, particularly officers of rank Inspector, deputy inspector and intelligence officers. Main character, The Professor, is a human but man, he definitely is portrayed as a someone with super hero powers overshadowing every other character in the whole series. Police is shown as bunch of jokers who can't even get the basics right.<br/><br/>Save yourself from this monstrosity and instead watch something else. Just stop watching after season 2, for your own sake... Spoiler Warning.<br/><br/>If Netflix acquiring the rights of La Casa de Papel and disintegrating the season 1 into two seasons and re-releasing them wasn't bad enough , they made season 3 and 4 without a proper storyline. With dumb logics , a heist is still in the running , fine and smooth over two seasons. From Tokyo starting to wage a war to get back Rio and dumping him later to Arturo drugging women to take their advantages as a hostage himself is just ridiculous.Palermo releasing Gandia with a dislocated thumb and yet the most overpowered character in that condition.Dead Berlin doesn't have a much to do yet he is seen just for audience pleasure.Same ways, predictable plots and dumb logic like how an entire nation doesn't know their army birds all just makes Money Heist a cliche of La Casa e Papel.Although some great soundtracks like the Gravita and some brilliant acting by the cast and Alvaro Morte and Rodrigo de la Sarna should be lauded.
All in all this is another one of Netflix spoiling a series for the sake of profit given the hype it had generated. Before now, after a bit of a confused start to the whole production, I was thinking 7-8 stars.<br/><br/>Now come the gaping plot holes and the snap-of-the-fingers magic that allows lazy screenwriters to have whatever their characters need no matter how implausible. This is reminding me of Season 2 of Sense8 or the end of S7 of GoT.<br/><br/>Here are the spoilers in this episode that made me shut it off; maybe I'll go back to it, maybe I won't:<br/><br/>1. The professor getting stuck in the mud. Really? Then leaving an RV full of equipment to be found?<br/><br/>2. Arturo running into the bank. These characters would have thrown him right back out again. I had enough of his character in the first two seasons and, in the periphery of this season, he was tolerated. Now he's just going to be intolerable. Again. I have zero interest in that character and a much-reduced interest in continuing the series.<br/><br/>3. The bug in Rio's clothes. C'mon... really.? You don't think the robbers would think "Oh, the police gave you these clothes, sure just keep wearing them and let's discuss all our plans while you're looking so good." And when they had the wand that Stockholm waved around Arturo you don?t think they'd have done the same to Rio.<br/><br/>God, I hate cheap, lazy and sloppy writing. Yet another series ruined as producers cut costs and sacrifice quality once a series is established to maximize their haul.<br/><br/>So incredibly disappointing. I'm giving an 8/10 for the first 2 seasons and have decided not to watch the remaining ones after reading all the comments about how it got a lot worse.<br/><br/>The first 2 seasons were epic. A must-watch series. What started out as exciting crime drama has denigrated into a farcical unbelievable black comedy. The keystone behaviour of the Spanish police is unbelievable Sorry Netflix, but it seems you just tried to make "money" (sic) with this...
1st season was new, amazing and innovative! It surfed above the global trend of "socialism" and normal people fighting against oppression... everyone loved it, actors etc... was translated everywhere and the became a phenomen with Dali's masks (symbol of Anonymous too)...
Ok during 1st season, all this was quite balanced and exciting.
Season 2, we end the topic quite properly... a bit Amercian though...<br/><br/>Then starts the tragedy... Netflix decides we can do more... not house of money, but Banco de España... Gold this time... well...
That's when everything becomes too much, Police become the very very bad guys, all political, abusive and very much oriented to current government in Spain... about social rights, Women's rights, men are violent, the team of Money heist becomes the victims almost, etc... even when nonsense in current context. And the new leader... this south American guy... Tokyo is less interesting there, Nairobi reveals herself! Well... I admit i watched season 4 as well to convince me, but my deepest regret was not to stop after season 2. The story line is really good and with average actors it could be brilliant. I don't think I would have started watching it, had I read the reviews first. Their are too many holes in the plot line e.g. a whole episode is dedicated to the professor trying to rid his car of fingerprints but nobody wears gloves and go around without masks in the mint/bank. I won't even comment on the crazy "romances" I hope that they spend all of their ill gotten gains on acting lessons. At least the Spanish police have a good legal case for defamation! HaHa!!!! This is the best Spanish show ! Great acting , has action , has suspense , has emotions and has many twists until season 4 came out<br/><br/>Season 1 : 10/10
Season 2 : 9/10
Season 3 : 8/10
Season 4 : 6/10 Season 1 was 7/10, had many flaws but was totally watchable.
Season 2 was 6/10, too much drama and even more plotholes.
Season 3 was 3/10, the downhill continues and you can understand something has changed. The way the story continues... Logic goes out of the window. They just wanted to make money from an already well known succesful series.
Season 4 is 2/10 more drama and nonsense than anything i have seen. I literally was laughing many times because of how bad the scenario and the scences were...<br/><br/>Should have definitely stopped after season 2. Just as title says. It's really fun to watch, but this is basically soap opera disguised in "action-crime-mistery". Just one plot hole after another, the weird character (the creep who wants to be the hostage just to get laid - season 3 & 4), really funny scenes with our main actors talking about love problems while catching this really bad and dangerous guy.. It's naive & stupid & a true quilty pleasure to watch :) The show is good, entertaining and "fresh", but I just don't get all the hype putting it at the level of the greatest tv shows of the late years.<br/><br/>If you want to pass time it is a funny tv series: nothing else. The plot is linear and very predictable, the characters are cliches, the acting is normal (some are really good some as ridiculous). Is it just me or does the acting suck? It's almost not worth watching at times. I'm watching it in english so maybe that has something to do with it? Apart from few initial episodes: the series is very average. Few of the key actors have shown really below average acting skills. Don't waste your time. The show is okay with lots and lots of suspense. HOWEVER, it is completely nonsensical and utterly illogical! Illogical events that would never happen in an ordinary world were created just to add up some spice. I couldn't see any character development. Characters behave in the most ridiculous of ways. Their actions are so unjustified.
I'm just giving it a 6/10 because of the suspense, which I had to ignore all the nonsense there was in the show in order to enjoy. Very imaginary serious. It doesn't deserve more than 4/10. I think I would have rated it 9 if it ended on season 2 while the ending for season 2 and the love story between the professor and Rakel was not too convincing for me to mess her life up and she didn't get any Prison time come on and because there is a huge fan base they keep milking them season after season just end it First two seasons are the best after that they just killed the series.Just stop watching after first two seasons Berlin's wedding saved the season.
OH MY GOD, WHY DID THEY BRING ARTURO BACK? Guys here who giving 10/10 and saying best show ever so far I have a message for them<br/><br/>You haven't seen yet anything A big big round of applause to the maker of this show "Álex Pina" and the entire cast. Extraterrestrial script, awesome direction, excellent acting by the cast and last but not the least, the theme song ' Bella Ciao" .This is one of the best shows I have seen so far. I wish few characters were not dead such as Moscow and Nairobi (my favourite characters). There is one character I hated the most which is undoubtedly "Arturo". This also means the actor justified the negative role.<br/><br/>Gracias por crear este show.<br/><br/>************************** The plot is filled with cliches and plot holes, There's maximum emotional drama and stupid actions by characters. The scenes feel anticlimactic with build up that ends up in nothing.
Btw, I'm in mid-season 2 now and I know no one is going to die because the writers don't feel like killing any of the characters<br/><br/>Waste of time (even during quarantine) To get a 10/10 watch only season 1 and 2 . It seems the writers decided to copy season 1 completely, then stretch the plot so hard you'd think you're watching a dragon Ball episode.
At this point it's going to end up like star wars. Seasons 1 & 2 were great, season 3 average at best. Do yourself a favor and don't even bother starting season 4!<br/><br/>The dialogue writing has deteriorated to the level of ridiculousness, the plot seems so forced, characters act obviously stupid so the story can go the way it is intended while some have plot Armour thicker than the vault walls of the Spanish Reserve bank. Someone getting shot at by 5 or so people with M-16 machine guns from a couple of meters but getting away without so much as a scratch. Bullet proof vests now seem to change ballistics here.<br/><br/>I was never this disappointed with a TV show.
Seems money and swift release dictated this recent season. Not worth for such a high rating. Can watch the first two season barring a few flaws. Avoid the rest as it goes downhill with absurd plotline and debased characters Tokyo's stupid and brainless attitude is making me dislike the whole plot of the serie, despite the need for twists in the plot. Drop that character out. This show is got bad from 4th season. especially 3rd and 4th season. Just want to say:
1. Watch only till season 2
2. Season 3 was forced, you wouldn't rob a bank if you have 300 million euros for gods sake.
3. Season 4 was an Indian love story till episode 6
4. They are showing as to get support of fan for the bad guys, like they have forgotten that the one who is doing wrong is the heist gang not the police.<br/><br/>Never ever try to watch 3,4 seasons.
Thank you Many plots are nonsense and made forcefully. Many crucial scenes don't have detailing because of that these scenes are not convincing.<br/><br/>For example when proffesor went to the hospital for angle, it was a trap by police. proffesor tricked police and enterd the hospital but magically went out of the hospital even if it was a trap by the police.
Monica asks Denver to turn around when she opens her jumpsuit so that she can swap her gun with denver's real one! It's totally nonsense cause denver would see her without jumpsuit anyway while examining the wounds.<br/><br/>Show has lots of nonsense like this. After two outstanding seasons, it has turned into a cliche itself. Just repeated lines and scenarios we have seen plenty of times IN the show (and meaningless flashbacks used as fillers). It really should have ended in Season 2 (Season 5 and 6 are already announced). Great Cast and acting though. I dont get the craze over this show. Personally it is over rated and the plots are being dragged on for far too long. The crooks spent 5 months to prep for the heist, going through every single detail. From wearing the same uniform and masks to hide their true identity. Yet, they can't find the time to buy a pair of gloves! Of course, leave traces of your prints all over the mint!<br/><br/>Also, their MO is very similar to that of the movie Inside Man. So for me that have watch Dalton Russell's work, find their move rather predictable. If you have watch Spike Lee's brilliant heist movie, then you can guess what is to come next with this show.<br/><br/>Most of the characters are annoying with almost no character development. Some were played to be integral to the storyline but then later just left on the sidelines, ending up like a featured extra.<br/><br/>The title Money Heist throws people off. I stopped after Season 2 because it became a love story more than an actual robbery. The robbers and hostages had time to fall in love as these sub plots is seriously ridiculous. I had to drag my feet to finish Season 1. The only reason I finish S2 is after reading the reviews here where some reviewers said to watch only up to S2. And so I did, regretfully.<br/><br/>What a waste of time! Seriously an over rated show. Don't trust the negative reviews. Definitely worth watching. One and two were logically acc ur age without and plot holes. Season 3 and 4 are dramatic with plot holes and lack of realism, however extremely entertaining just like the first 2 seasons. Saw the series after it was highly recommended.<br/><br/>I went through the entire series hoping it would through up surprise. However, I have never seen the police projected as such an irrational bunch. Military technology has been shown to be accessible to a bunch of petty crooks, while being inaccessible to the police. The crooks have been shown to have a human side, but not the authorities. The plot was very good, but the execution very poor.
Terrorists who do not hesitate to kill people are to be believed when they mouth "I am not a murderer". Did the series not consider that audience has some intellect?!! A great series taking a deep dive. ..overstretched with season 4 roaming around one character ( gandia ) . hope the title of the review says it all. This show should have ended with the second season. From the third one, nothing makes sense, the problem is that it is going to be very long.
Please stop the series when the plot ends. The plot is considerable to the core, contains twist in ending of each episode. Also , the acting is strong enough to the carry out the role. Money heist had a good first episode filled with a potential good story, good character introduction, good acting, great visuals but left a bad taste in my mouth because of the ending of the episode when the female lead character took matters into her own hands and compromised the plan because of her lover who is also with her all while she is being introduced to the viewer as someone who just a few days back lost the love of her life in a heist. In the same episode? The romance felt forced and rushed. Then in the second episode. It turns out that her lover didn't get shot and she compromised the whole thing because of someone she just met and he didn't even get shot. Damn that's stupid. But thankfully she didn't compromised the plan very much cause she can't aim while being a professional. Next on, the forced couple fights while a hostage seizes the opportunity to take her phone not to call someone but to delete a nude. Yeah right, to delete a nude while being taken hostage. Anyways through plot magic the police hacks in these milliseconds her phone camera and has a livefeed from the room and catches the main female leads lover while he rushed to grab the hostages phone. The police finds out who he is. And the plan gets more compromised. In episode three, the mastermind behind the plan orders to find the phone from which a colleague got identified. The main female leads lover eventually confessed that he himself was to blame. And his colleagues rightfully beat him up because it's the second time he and his forced love with main female lead compromised the plan. Then the, in my opinion, maniac and not at all professional main female lead takes matters into her own hands again and shoots the cameras which serve the actual mastermind of the operation. Because she is a PROFESSIONAL. That's when I stopped watching.<br/><br/>And don't get me wrong. I like that their plan is kinda failing. But three episodes all because of a stupid wild and possibly dementia(she had the love of her life in episode one killed) suffering main female lead is kinda enough. Especially since I know the creators intention was to create a fearsome and cool main female lead and it backfired in the most laughable way. It got me thinking that it is perhaps created for teen girls and should not be regarded as a serious tv show. If that is the case I change my rating to 6.<br/><br/>It's just a pitty cause the series in other aspects really promised. No show can match this level of intelligence and the suspense. It's worth spending time watching this show I have never rated anything 10/10 in my life but after watching 2 seasons of this which itself is complete i would say that this show is the best show i have ever watched till date. I don't want to watch the season 3 because i am afraid it will be not as great as the first two seasons but i can't stop myself maybe this show has more surprises who knows! I never write reviews for shows but this show surprised me soooo much sooo many times! Please please ignore all of the stupid bad reviews. I am not typically a woman that enjoys heist movies or shows so I didn't think I'd like it when a friend at work recommended it to me. It is full of action and has a great storyline. Cannot wait for April.
I literally couldn't get anything done with my life while watching this show. Every episode seemed to end with a cliffhanger so I'd just go on to the next episode. The professor (over the heist) is genius and it is so interesting to watch. S01- 9/10
S02- 10/10
S03- 7/10 ( it is basically a family drama) It started with high expectations in the first season but lost its way in subsequent seasons, the paper house burned I think first rob was a masterpiece creative rebel and plenty of surprises.
Since Netflix bought it.
It's better film with beautiful scenes but that's it.
Abuse of Bella ciao song.
Typical Bin Laden and Russian references.
Dumb profesor and bad plan far from original,
Lack of creativity Just finished the second season, which marks the end of the main story. In short - I feel a bit exhausted. Why? Because of the script. Overall there is great production value, the dialogues are well written, the characters are believable. But the story itself is not THAT original (Inside Man, anybody?) and on top of that, the whole story suffers greatly from the main and constantly overused plot device, or rather, a plot-cheat. It is something that's also predominantly present in another known and praised TV show - The Walking Dead. Can you guess? Yes, it's the characters' incompetence, borderline idiotic decisions and also the unbelievable coincidences or plain nonsense that are commonly incorporated into the narrative. For a keen eyed, intelligent and inquisitive viewer this feels like material for a good story riddled with a barrage of frustrating twists and turns. It is what is best described as lazy writing. Let me give you an example "everything is going very well for our characters, then suddenly SOMETHING and one of them needs to go out of "the plan" to correct it. He has time and means to go prepared, he is a criminal mastermind and then we see him do some very incriminating activity without gloves. Aaaand this way we are soon in a whole lot bigger trouble. Which I accept, but we really could get there in some more sophisticated way. I really can't count the times I yelled at the screen wanting those supposedly hardened criminals to just grow a pair and get together. Not to mention the obvious nonsensical plot holes - like in one episode we learn that spanish policia has a protocol to close down the entire city in search of terrorists - which they enact to catch a single suspect, but when a group of criminals with a lot of money is getting away (just by a thread, of course) the police just stands there.<br/><br/>Just started the third season and I see that there is no change for the better. Magically the satellite phones can be traced geographically (they can't actually, all you can know from the other side is which satellite the called is connected to, which gives you pretty much a quarter of the globe area). But if that was the case in the story, then we would have to make up some actually intelligent way for authorities to find our fugutives.<br/><br/>All in all, there's plenty good here, but it's not like it's something that's never been done before. Except the language, it reeks of hollywood writing and directing style and not in a good way.<br/><br/>6/10. Turns out to be a pretty stupid show. If you don't care about things making sense then go ahead, it can still be entertaining to watch. What a great show!! Ignore the negative comments. They're either clinically depressed armchair critics or trump supporting racists. Very boring or annoying characters with one exception (berlin) and a story that tries to be special but isnt very exciting. too many love stories and a lot of missed opportunities because the concept is interesting. So I didn't watch this show because it was in Spanish and knowing that there was still an English version, I didn't think the English version would match up. Let's just say this is by far the most impressive tv show I've ever watched. I compare it to Prison Break, it's that good and that intense! There's so many things that happen, it definitely keeps you guessing and wanting more! I just started season 3 and I can tell you I don't want to stop watching! The things that happen are insane and the Professor is immaculate! One of the best series in action,crime and thriller. Love all the characters specially pedro Alonso's and also hats off to professor.Great work, best of luck for series future. This series is a complete package. With very good script, direction and acting this series makes you feel emotions of every character. I have seen few more heist movies but this is untouchable. Liked professor and Berlin's character the most. Tokyo was irritating at places. So nicee.. very interesting,I recommend you watch,I enjoyed it very much when watched that cliffhanger In short, IT'S A MASTERPIECE!! 😍
Every single episode is full of suspense, you don't feel like there are any filler episodes.<br/><br/>Every single character is special and unique in his/her own way. You would easily feel interested to know more about their background story before the heist.<br/><br/>It honestly should be number 1 on IMDb for all the excitement and thrill this show provide you. From the very beginning of the show, from the first episode, it gives you a great first impression and it doesn't fail your expectations. The actors snd actresses, the pace of the story... well done Spain, this is a great series. I will watch it again while waiting for n.3 Unexpectedly brilliant, although it would be better if Netflix released all the episodes at once. Also the English dub is somewhat lacking, it's better to watch with the original voices. I would say this is great ... from the act.... to the tactics to the ideas ... to the music ... to the ending ...
One of the best I have seen ....
Bella Ciao Amazing characters , amazing writing & directing.
The professor character was truly captivating.
A story full of suspense, excitement & emotions.
You must watch it & enjoy it. This is the best TV series I've ever watched. Every single part is awesome. I never thought that i will love crime tv shows. One of the best tv series ever, full of drama . amazing acting from all the actors and actresses. It's a must watch series. Puta Mierrdaaa The most great TV shows series in the history, you will never boring Most wonderful, uunpredictable, well acted tv series i have ever had the pleasure of watching.
Fantastically acted and brilliantly scripted.
Watch in Spanish with subtitles, doesnt work for me dubbed.
More please,
;) I loved this serial not only for the good scenary and details that kept me tied to the screen
I also appreciated the psychological evolution of the characters, how they started to attack one another despite being good friends before. And also the behaviour of the prisoners and how they can change opinions under threats. Congratulations! Its been long time since i have seen a good film I was looking for a series to watch in Spanish so I could foster my language skills. This series did not disappoint! I liked all of the twists and turns and I thought the actors gave some strong performances. I especially liked Álvaro Morte as the Professor. It is true that some of the plot is a bit unrealistic, but I still found it captivating. I have to say that I felt like the second season had a great ending and that they should have left it at that. I will probably watch season 3 anyway, but I don't think that it will top the first two. Probably one of the best things I've ever watched! Clever, full of suspense & great acting! Superb! Can't wait for Season 3!! This is the best serial ever made! I can not believe how man can insparation for something like this. Every second of serial is excitinig, interesting and strong. I do recomande this! My favourite så far! Allh heists have done a great job especially Álvaro I am not good at writing reviews. So, when I say this is a great show, believe me it is. I've watched the first two seasons. I really liked them! Very interesting plot and characters. Acting is more than decent, as well as the director's work. Quite unpredictable and very adventurous story line. I would definitely recommend it, especially to youngsters who are looking for something exciting and cool. It deserves its fame! Excellent series. A must watch. Acting is great and so refreshingly different from the typical US shows dominating Netflix. Series Starts with one aim and took turns in every episode, suspense and thrill portrayed very well ans and editing is outstanding which connects storyline. I have to preface this by saying that I have been quite impressed by the first few episodes of this show, so much so that I didn't mind the foreign language or the weird acting by some of the cast. It's certainly worth a watch, and the premise is very interesting.<br/><br/>However, the action is at times less believable and the pacing is really all over the place. Add to that the flat characters that never react to anything and the plot which just seems to float from episode to episode on the writers' whim, and you get something with a lot of potential but poor execution.<br/><br/>Without going into too much detail, it is probably obvious to everyone that this is about a plan which doesn't work out entirely as intended, or they wouldn't have multiple seasons of it. As such, sometimes the ways the plan moves along or doesn't are very out exaggerated and unlikely, and it really bothers me as a viewer for some master criminals to be this incompetent at times. The ending of the first season especially, makes things feel like the work of street corner amateurs rather than true professionals, and there is no plan A, let alone B or C. And the way some problems with the plan get resolved makes us ask the question: why wasn't that just part of the plan from the beginning!<br/><br/>The pacing as well is very inconsistent, with episodes which are full of action followed by episodes full of minor character drama and flashbacks which really don't go anywhere.<br/><br/>Another criticism I want to leverage is that the characters are very one-dimensional, and even their main traits sometimes don't even matter as they become cardboard cutouts of people. The most present hostage, for example, goes through immense emotional states but none of them seem to change him in any way. The same goes for the robbers, they never change, they are never really affected, they just keep being at times a badass and at times absolute amateurs.<br/><br/>Finally, I feel the biggest problem is that the plot itself is in such stark contrast to the premise of the show. I get that they wanted to create intrigue and conflict to move the story forward and stretch it out to many seasons, but you can't have the greatest plan in the world be constantly foiled by crappy plot points and cartoony drama. Amazing doesn't quite cut it. This clever creation was like riding on a roller coaster from start to finish. Tokyo is such a bit#h that I hate her.
This series is brilliant. Yes, this is my all-time favorite TV/Netflix show, which is saying a lot. I just loved it - I can't understand why some people didn't like it. The plot is interesting and keeps getting more and more so. The characters are varied and unique. There are basically 12 main characters, all of whom you get to know well, and come to like or not, but in any case become really interested in. What's great about the show is that the relationships, the dynamics between these characters - the heist crew, the hostages, the professor (leader) and the policewoman - keep changing with each episode. You're never sure what's going to happen next, and it's always something interesting (usually several things). Also, the show is only two seasons long, so it doesn't get stretched out, requiring long, boring sections, as for example Breaking Bad in seasons 4 and 5.
What's more, _everyone_ I've recommended this show to has also gotten really into it, emailing me saying things like, Who was your favorite character? I liked Tokyo but now I love Nairobi...etc. (The heist crew call each other by city names.)
Seriously, I can almost guarantee you're going to love this show. Acting +story line is superb .. must watch show if u have liked breaking bad n given 10/10 then its pretty much same Love this series.. very good making, great actors, and a fascinating story!
For everyone who loves series like prison break or breaking bad ist this a must see! Beautiful!! The whole serie is perfect with an good ending and good cast If your are reading this, do not watch this show. Its utter utter nonsense. Total rubbish. It will take you to a joy ride of strong emotions which has thrill, love, suspense. This series is a remake of 2006 movie Inside Man.
Both are good. Claims on Wikipedia list this as a Spanish original concept and work. 😍 Awesome I love it.
Fantastic role of Professor. The whole series create Great situations on every Moment. I am really excited about next season.<br/><br/>Director Hurry up????? It's one of the best series ever i seen! Every episode twist and twist. I enjoyed all seasons. Waiting for next season. This show is awesome. Thriller, crime drama and a little bit of root for the bad guys. In 2 days i finished watching season 1.
the series is really thrilling and exciting and keeps a hold.<br/><br/>Only boring aspect of the series is the personal life of Inspector raquel, it makes you feel like you are watching some 15-20 year old TV Serial when her personal issues are brought up again and again.... Season 1 and 2 it's the real store
after that all is accessory and waste time More than worst. Just a fckng waste of time.
Dont waste time watchinf this just watch
'Spartacus' and you will be amazed by seeing. I was really astonished to see the overwhelming response to this serial by the young generation. If this kind of logic, supporting the crime and illicit relations is acceptable to our coming generation then the world has really changed and senior citizens like me, who believe in morals, ethics and good nature are fools in today's world. The first two seasons have some merit but the next seasons are utterly foolish and showing the entire Spanish police force and their intelligence as a dumbest lot. The first season of this show is a hidden gem on Netflix loved it and couldn't stop watching, however the writing starts falling apart towards the end of season 2, that's when it starts getting ridiculous, specificly motorcycle scene Rushing unscathed into the royal mint midsts of sniper and machine gun fire is when the show jumps the shark and then the plot just gets worse and worse and even gets boring.<br/><br/>As a result I have decided not to watch this show beyond season 2 Everything is illogical in this show so much overrated This show is so much illogical and people are following it blindly from begining to the end i have never seen logic in this series Like said before, after a promising start, it just get so annoying like a torture. I don't know how these caracters are loveable, but I just keep watching it with a hope, that they will fail.
If the police is as stupid as in the show, than the world is screwed... Becomes quite boring quite quickly. Inside man was a way better heist. Man on a ledge or rapid exchange. This is just boring soap opera garbage. I've given it 3 stars to match the number of episodes I could stomach. This show lost me when the crims started behaving like poor cliches of soap characters. Caring more about the personal lives of the hostages & police than the actual task at hand... who does that? So unbelievable I had to give up. Reading some of the "critic" reviews has caused me to question whether or not they have seen the same show I tried to watch. Everything went smoothly till S2. Professor's Voice was suited to his character. Denver's laughs were funny and also suited him.<br/><br/>But I don't know why Netflix chose to introduce new dubbers . Season 1 and 2 were great. The only thing I chose to rate it 5 stars because of it's dubbing. I watched first episode of S3. Then I decided to watch in Spanish with subs. Went from 7 to 4/5 real quick. The only thing season 3/4 robs is your time. Please delete your logic from your brain before you proceed. It made Spain's authorities look like fools. Lousy script, lousy actors, a mediocre serie that became trendy thanks to a very undemanding audience. Most of us might say season 3 & 4 is a waste of time but imho, this series managed to enter into people's minds & hearts with their meticulously crafted characters & unexpected moves & plots by the professor. Season 4 could've been better but still it manages to keep the adrenaline rush... I'd love to see them in the coming years as well.... Most pointless tv show I have seen in a long time...still can't figure out how this crap is so much hyped.... please don't waste your time by watching these....you can watch the entire season of money heist still can't figure out why so much hyped..... On season 2 only as of now. S02e05 .. wat stupidity yar. That hospital scene.. then that hostage rebel scene.. it doesn't seem real at all .. It started well and ended up having too many loose ends.
Too much of a drag, its not crisp.
Are the makers only interested in making as many episodes as possible. I liked season 1 and 2 , but when season 3 started it was screwed, as if police are the dumbest and the professor is the ultimate god, oh my god he has thought of every possible moment, there is not a single change in plan by the police as if he is the commandor. please stop this series or atleast make it believable. So we all love a good thriller and especially one involving a bank robbery and hostages. An excellent idea, a superb start the first season and parts of the second season where excellent but then they destroyed everything with loads and loads of melodrama and stupidity.
In fact some of the most melodramatic Bollywood films seem better than Money Heist. You can watch a lot of the episodes on Fast Forward.
Why did they drag and ruin everything. This series has so many problems that I just can't sit still and watch.
The robbers behave so unprofessionally that they can't do anything right. They can't scare the hostages to be afraid, they can't control them. They have their phone and weapons stolen, they run away from them - but there is no punishment for that, the hostages go on and look for something else to do, because the robbers see nothing - they are happy that they are robbing something and have a weapon that is directed against them. The robbers do not listen to each other, can not work in a team and help each other, behave pathetically but it does not give them anything. Focus on love, not on how things go.
The series is more suitable for teenage drama than for something serious.
4 \ 10 Plot is similar to "Prison Break" but very bad version of it! I couldn't wait the next episodes of "Prison Break"! This one? "ehhh" Okay for me season 1and 2 deserve 8_8.5
Season 3 was not bad deserve rating from 7_8
But season 4 is adifferent story at all........
1 First no any progres come in this whole season just save nairobi in firsts episod to kill her in the episode...
2 Second: the main story of the series is changed from gang stole bank to resestance and stupid stuff
3 third: the main foucus in season 4 wasnot about tactic and strategy in stealing like first 2 season but it was about love and couple stuff and maserat<br/><br/>4 fourth : the fourth season was commerical
With cheap story with alot of fanscene .....
5 fifth :stop bring flash back for berlin the people start hating him espocall after fork scene
.....ihope you will not annoying us with alot of flashback of nairobi and berlin in season 5
Now iwill keep my rating 8 star but if 5 season was also dissapointed iwill reduce the rating
And evry one will Writers are stretching story. In chaos, they acting more chaotic with their personal relationship & what entry Arturo Roman planned in season 4. Why to use copy who is having medical conditions. I felt bad for Spain people how they see this & is it military or police so dumb in Spain.....it's very boring by giving name money heist....you guys were showing daily soap relationship fights half of the time. & Freaking phyco people were plan to rob......... Serbs arent war criminals.Also first 2 brilliant season Watching the 1st three episodes of Season 1, one can already predict the future of this series. It's like watching noontime soap opera. The "profile" of the characters, who were first and foremost selected due to their "hard core" "nothing to loose" personas is completely contradictory to the way they unfolded themselves in every episode. Too many irrelevant and stupid scenes (constant recall of Berlin's wedding unless Tatiana turns out to be Sierra!) and characters (Arturo for one!), Racquel sitting for hours in front of Alicia saying nothing when she was once one of the best hostage negotiators, Robbers making a mockery of themselves in front of their hostages by bickering and contradicting each other, the professor getting annoying by the minute. I think the writers under estimated the intellect of the viewers. I can't believe they killed Nairobi's character when she is the one compensating for the stupidity of the others. Overall, the series doesnt have the charm of Italian Job and the thrill of The Bank Job. If the viewers want to have some netflix excitement- i highly recommend Vis a Vis (Locked Up). Stay safe everyone! Really got intrigued by the first two seasons. Now I'm into season 4 and don't like it anymore. It's at the same time boring and full of unnessecary violence, drama and many flashbacks. The character development is no longer reproducible to me. I no longer enjoy the series and that makes me sad, because it really started off as something special and enthralling. The season 1 is one of the best TV-series I've ever seen.
But.
While the beginning of the show was about a game against the police, starting season 2 the main plot movers are heroes taking idiotic decisions. Watching the show further from this point was a pain from, ironically, "spanish shame" and facepalms.<br/><br/>The story follows 2 lines, basically. One inside the Royal Mint (that is robbed) and the one outside. While the outside story is overstretched, it's keeping the suspense and goes well. The one inside became a random-rolling of decisions. It's like, imagine you are on the edge of the cliff, afraid that it might collapse with you. So, instead of moving away from the edge, you start digging down, stomping, whining, just doing anything, but moving away. And do it from episode-to-episode. I just don't like watching the movies about idiots. There is a comedy genre for it.<br/><br/>It's unfortunate the show couldn't live up to expectations, but the effort was great, for sure. It follows the standard pattern of the best ideas being used early, and inventing subpar story movers on the way. It happened to Lost, Prison Break, The Walking Dead before. I found the first season to be very ordinary and not as sensational as it's being made out to be.I couldn't understand why "Tokio" provided the voiceover as she had the loudest and most obnoxious and sickening character and as a result it was very difficult to relate to her when she was relating the incidents in a calm manner.The "Professor" was not smooth at all and this was a big let down as he was supposed to be very knowledgeable which he was and Zen like which he was not. There were also some sub plots in the 1st season which did not make any sense at all.My favourite character was "Berlin"
Even the 2and season was quite ordinary with the "Professor " making lots of silly mistakes which was very unbecoming of a professional and experienced strategist.
Once again in the 2nd season my favourite was " Berlin"and to a lesser extent "Moscow"
SEASON 3 IS A DISASTER and so not bothering to waste my time watching Season 4 10/10 for the first 2 seasons<br/><br/>5/10 for the rest<br/><br/>It should have been ended at season two. Just like Lost and Prison brake this series started off great but then went down hill fast! but the 3rd season you start asking yourself this is unbelievable with some episodes just used as fillers, Maybe I'm looking for too much in it but if your going to pull off a big job like this why would you get involved with the copper in charge of capturing you! I Gave up watching and still being constantly reminded from Netflix to watch this. I started watching, thinking it was only two series. Started off well, but towards the end of season 2 became more and more ridiculous. Shame, as it has some fantastic moments. I have to say that despite some somewhat corny characters I am enjoying this show. It keeps you wanting to know what next, what's going to happen with him or her, how's this out that situation going to turn out etc etc so full marks there.
However, the gigantic elephant in the room is the timeline. Some films and series play around with their timeline for effect and can be worked out in one's own mind, albeit with a little artistic licence here and there.
But this is on another planet....
I am on episode 4 season 2 (the 17th episode!) and they are only 3 days and 11 hours into the heist! This is simply NOT PLAUSIBLE.
With all that had happened; people's recovery rates from being shot (for gods sake), love affairs and even the amount of travel and moving around that has gone on, it is completely absurd that we are expected to believe that this has all happened during the course of 3 and a bit days (minus at least a few hours sleep here and there).
IMHO it is a massive oversight and from that point of view renders the production a laughing stock.
The sense of time passing and how that is handled is critical to most productions, and specifically to those that specifically track the time/duration of the happening.
On this, they have completely failed. They would have been better off leaving it up to the viewer to assume how long it had gone on for.
If you can ignore this aspect its quite a good series. Started out promising.
Season 2 - now it's becoming ridiculous, not even worth watching.
It's becoming a comedy of errors & unbelievable. While many would say it is the best but to be very honest it is an average show...with blind fan following. So this started off interesting and with huge potential. The storyline is really good, but the characters... some of the characters are just painful to watch.
The conflicts between them and their emotions are well written and that is fun to watch.<br/><br/>The antagonists (police) are kind of emotionless and that makes the viewers take the side of the protagonists without even looking into what the antagonists are driven by because it isn't there. Okay you may be saying "it's the police and that's their job", and you're right, it is their job but that doesn't make an excuse for not giving them a better reason than just following orders.<br/><br/>In my opinion all the seasons so far have been interesting to watch but I feel like there is still something missing. Plot holes everywhere, unnecessary political correctness topics and sex topics forcefully wrote into the script, Netflix needs to wake up, these are the things ruining good IP, I mourn for these good series. Should have stopped at the end of season 2. Season 3 is a bad copy of the last two seasons... season four has plenty of controversies... it has some good sociopolitical ideas but it s not worth the time... that s why i believe in miniseries 😁 I think that the producers should've done the same thing that the ''Breaking Bad'' producers did... instead of making season 4 it would've been better if they had made a movie to final it down, im sure it would've had a much better and satisfying outcome.
La Casa de Papel started pretty well in my opinion, interesting start off, it was fun and accually really hyped, but over time it started to get lame, i was losing interess in it, then i must admit that when it got to the last episode of season 3 when The Proffessor fell in his own trap thinking that Raquel was killed...it got my attention, it was well made, but then season 4 came...and OMG, why didnt they just made a movie to explain an ending to all of it in a short film, just like in Breaking Bad El Camino, sure it would've been kind of a rip off but im sure it would've turned out something way much better and descent and best of all it would have ended right there, Season 4 shouldn't have been made, stupid, boring, plot holes, unsatisfying, Now i dont even know if i should watch Season 5, and i really did not understand what was the huge hype about this season 4 all about. So much over efficiency in the last season moving one to another countries in no time etc etc... Very good series with a brilliant actors but extend the events and love thing ruind its perfection (I couldn't get through season 2) Unpopular Opinion: Money Heist/La Casa de Papel is the most overrated waste-of-time series on Netflix (and perhaps streaming syndicates to date). Just a few reasons: over the top melodrama with psychotic 'love' stories that drown the plot; main characters that are cliche and all but impossible to sympathize with, unoriginal soundtracking borrowed from American Beauty and only 1/3 of the cast is comprised of decent acting. Most of all it is WAY too long in telling the story that needs to be told. Apparently it is being positively compared to Breaking Bad. Wow. Money Heist doesn't even come close to seeing the dirt on the bottom of Breaking Bad's feet it's buried so far beneath it. One thing I will say is the public interest it has generated in foreign production is a plus. We need more exposure to foreign film. But sorry not sorry, you can't remotely compare it to works of art like Breaking Bad. Someone please tell me how Money Heist/La Casa de Papel has a claimed a 4.8 on google, an 8.5 on IMDB and a 91% on RT. Then again, the live action version of Aladdin also got rave reviews from the general audience. Maybe as a society we are just becoming that simple/easy to please.<br/><br/>Series that are actually worth a watch: Barry, Chernobyl, BoJack Horseman, Succession, Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul, Schitt's Creek, Fleabag, Dirty Money, Killing Eve, The OA, Russian Doll, When They See Us, It's Bruno!, Bodyguard, The Americans, Westworld. The TV show is nothing but a bunch of mind fucked lunatics hired by The Professor (Who has a well plan, but coud execute it properly). It appeared that felt headache watching this show.
Poor cast, poor acting, poor content, poor Dialogues, messed up TV series.
And here I can tell you with all this hype for this show, People don't want content and acting. No respect for Real Cinema. Sad! I rated only 8 because of the 1st and 2nd seasons...the script of the rest of the seasons are so terrible that i was hoping when this hell of episodes are going to end..how long anyone can fool or cheat someone, this series are full of dumb plans of foolishness...3rd and 4th seasons are full of flashbacks with no appropriate link to any scenes...if they want Berlin in the rest of episodes why the hell they killed him, he could have simply escaped through that trench and place him in the rest of the episodes...one main problem with this series is that the characters we are are more attached too are now our haters....the cops had enough and plenty of time to attack the thief's and still they do all the foolishness by providing stupid doubts within them...the professor could imagine what others are going to do or what they think but HOW it is completely illogical...it is so sad i had just wasted my time watching this series..i don't recommend this to anyone..please avoid this series... First two seasons were good, good idea and good acting. later on this is lets take money wile we can. such big mistakes in script, rambo is little boy for few hostages. Arturo can make 2 times rebelion stab with scissors and come again inside and everybody is ok whit that. reality is no longer priority, let's make fake tension that way it would be better. You ruined good show, Money heist team you should change profession. Don't make trash like this anymore. Two routes occur in real time: the police and the professor team.
Memory Routine: Teach the past of the characters in the team, some memories, some high lights that happened when they were training.
Some people say that it can be made into a movie, but also dragged on for two seasons.
I like this way of shooting details, shooting the past, and portraying the characters in more detail.
Several important figures involved in the team of professors, each of whom has a painful past to look at.
I probably also like the oddball, does not follow the common sense card, does not shoot "three views are very straight" the movie director ~ In India there is a huge fan base of webseries of Netflix Amazon Prime hbo and many more plzz dubb this series money hiest in hindi also Because of the language barrier, I didn't pick this show at first. But I saw a lot of recommendations for this show. So I started to watch. First two seasons are mind blowing and only thing in my mind was, "Why didn't I watched this series before". So I continued to watch the third season. Though it got some similarities with the first two season, I enjoyed it. But the last season was totally waste of time. If they drag the same story like this, people will eventually get bored. So I think it's time to finish the 2nd Story line and start a new story line apart from the first two.<br/><br/>So If you are looking forward to watch this show, I really recommend it. First two seasons are mind blowing. So first watch them. After that. no argue you are going to watch the other two seasons. Then you decide what you are going to do with the upcoming seasons.<br/><br/>First two seasons 10/10
Third Season 8/10
Fourth Season 5/10<br/><br/>Thanks Season 1 and 2 was awesome. They show us how perfectly a heist can be done in a very realistic manners. However, they should have better stopped after it because season 3 and 4 just spoiled it all. It was no longer meticulously planned. Season 3 pace is slower than previous two one , however season 4 is more slower than 3. After completion of season 3 I have thought they will show some more convincing plot. But in season 4 one can directly jump to episode 6 eithout missing anything. From 1 to 5 episodes they have only focused on gandia....And dont know why they have given him so much prefference and whats the role for arturo. It was dumb decision. Finally, I can say sea
son 1 & 2 is incredible, season 3 is good and season 4 is waste..... There's no better time to watch season of this epic heist series. With quarantine and everything going in the world, it won't hurt to watch something exciting. In fact, it would hurt to NOT do something exciting.<br/><br/>Season 4<br/><br/>Episode 1: At this stage we're just happy to continue watching the series, and get the chance to witness the cliffhanger left in the previous episode. Apart from Berlin's song (highlight of the episode for sure), and the professor's colorful display of emotions Tokyo's guts (she's always full of em), I would say pretty much forgettable.<br/><br/>Episode 2: Where the plan starts going downhill, largely due to Palermo's doing. And between his subtle but effective start of a character transformation, to Denver's love troubles and some Jaw breaking moments (literally) between Marseille and the professor, I'd say pretty much interesting all round and Promising, (Apart from Arturo's disgusting presence that is.) Signs of things to come.
Episode 3: Finally, the reemergence of the Professor we all fell in love with. Tokyo at her peak, her vulgar remarks making the episode more interesting, Some worthy quotes and superb dialogues and finally a cliffhanger worth the wait. Impressive, bar the beating up of 'the fat guy' in the bathroom scene which is totally unnecessary.<br/><br/>Episode 4: Some highly choreographed action scenes. Delightful watching Stockholm's demonstration of leadership skills. Some top notch performances and exchange by Gandia and Berlin. The scene about the business of managing the economic crisis was gotten wrong, if you ask me. The beginning of the of Sierra's character evolution. Stellar performances and pretty much enjoyable, except the mere presence of Arturo which is meant to deepen our disdain for him. And it did.<br/><br/>Episode 5: One of the most brilliantly written and intensely packed episode. From nice action scenes to a semblance of emotional connection and full of surprise. Between Tokyo's exchange with Gandia, and that exquisite Nairobi's pose? We wouldn't have wish for a better episode.
Episode 6. Nairobi's big re
veal kind of spoil her impending doom, which makes it less emotional when it finally arrived. A pivotal change in the relationship between Denver and Stockholm's relationship, maybe for the better. Brilliant planning (as always) by the professor who so far seems to have been dozing. Moving.<br/><br/>7. The whole team Still a little bit weary from the death of Nairobi. A befitting tribute to Nairobi. Subtle show of emotion by Sierra. Apart from the suspense at the end? Tiring.<br/><br/>8: The most marvelously written and acted episode and the one for Major reveals. From a pivotal change in the image of Palermo (probably to sacrifice him later on), Sierra's bombshell and once again a remarkable show of leadership by Stockholm, a departure from the woman we saw being manipulated by Arturo in the start of the Series. Oh and perhaps a nail in the coffin for her relationship with Denver. Once again an uninspiring attempt of evoking our emotions. Finally, a worthy match to the professor in Sierra, though credit must be given for his articulate planning of the rescue mission. A delightful performance by Manila and perhaps we'll get to see more of her in coming episodes. Not much of a cliffhanger at the end though. I mean we all know Sierra won't do anything rash seeing as she is a persona non grata herself but will instead switch to her own best trait; negotiations. An undeserving end to Gandia too. Apart from those, what an intensely charged and highly choreographed episode! Memorable.<br/><br/>In conclusion; Largely shallow plot details, but we can't help but marvel at the depth of the character transformations. Now that we seemingly understand Palermo's plight, we might even come to empathize with him. One can't help but get enthralled with Rio's boyish charm and innocence, and impressed with Stockholm's leadership streak (future heist leader?) and be saddened by Lisbon's growing irrelevance and the professor's seeming aloofness (which says a lot about how the heist might ultimately come to fail) and Tokyo's...well Tokyo being Tokyo. And Arturo, really? To think that we though a character couldn't be more despicable. Throw in another two more seasons with this below par performance, and they just might lose their fan base. The first season is unforgettable. The ending of the second season is complete. The third season is exciting. The beginning is dull, I will endure. The fourth season forcibly slows down the rhythm,
To extend to the fifth season, even the sixth season is to make the audience angry.

Ruined this episode, it was heartbreaking
season 1: 8star / season 2: 9star / season 3: 6star / season 4: 3star Why season 4 so boring whyy??
Season 1-2 the bestt!
Sesson 3 hmmm
Season 4 😔 Poor, lazy and predictable writing. Heard good things so I gave it a go but very disappointing. If your idea of a good show is bad characters, scenes full of coincidence to suit the story, terribly predictable attempt of 'cliff hangers" and a cringey love story thrown in then this will be the show for you. I expect these things when I watch certain shows and can get on board.... not a heist movie. People complaint about the seasons 3 and 4 (which i never watched ) but i found nothing special with even the first 2 seasons
The robbers were dumb , the professor was dumb to have a relationship with the inspector and how the hell was their asses saved?...coz the police were dumber . Season 1 review:<br/><br/>The idea of this show is pretty good but the execution is disappointing. I would rate it a 6.5/10. It was like watching a worse version of Prison Break. The pace is really slow, with some ironically rushed direction. 13 episodes cover 70 hours in the story. That's 6 days, when we've been told from the beginning that the heist will last 10-12 days.<br/><br/>The season is full of unnatural and forced romantic sub-plots, like no other movie/show I've seen before. Hostages are getting romantically involved with their captors like it's nothing. The number of times one of the criminals messes up just because of their horniness is unbelievable. People who've known each other for few hours or days are acting like Romeo and Juliet. Apart from the overuse of romance, there are many other flaws. The main police negotiator is mentally weak and emotionally incapable of doing her job. She would go out with a stranger in the middle of a globally followed hostage scenario. She flips out on her colleague of 15 years and calls him a rat without any actual investigation or proof. Apart from that, thieves are made to look like priests, preaching the hostages about life in certain scenes. Too much focus has gone towards showing emotional scenes even where it makes absolutely no sense. Character development is very messy and rushed, (given the time they spent on it) except for Tokyo, who's backstory was told before she was shown engaging with her new team.<br/><br/>If you ignore the bad writing and direction, the main story is pretty good and hence it's passively watchable. It's some of scenes didn't make any sense.
Really we are disappointed . A great series or movie it's great when you know nothing about who's getting killed , in this series you know nobody its getting hurt , the main character ( Tokyo) it's the most annoying of all and the whole thing is just very predictable. The only reason I have it 5 stars is because of "the professor " hes actually pretty cool ... The premise of the show is great. However, the writing is getting worse and and worse and they are going further and further away from the quality of season 1. I just finished season 4, and it was almost unwatchable. You have these 8 or 9 thieves who were 'hand picked" due to their skills, yet halfway through the show you have none of them doing the things they are supposed to be good at. They are all just going off plan and acting like 2 year olds. Real crooks would be focused on getting the money, nothing more. The last 2 season you've add 2 or more of the crew doing nothing but make trouble for everyone and trying to bang hostages. Enough already! Let's face it, we as viewers just want to see them win - get the money, get rich and move on. We really don't care that Nairobi gave her crack baby away or that Moscow is gay. WE DON'T CARE! Get the gold and end the season for God's sake. Season 1 and 2 amazing, unexpected events with a twist of ibteresting plots and subjects, season 3 good intro into the heist remake of season 1, season 4 total rip off from the series, just happens to be the best assassin in spain, and gets shot couple of times doesnt die, kills nairobi and still nobody shoots him, from s4 e4 just a stupid drama series, even a 15-year old would make a better plot twist than this, cant believe, not even worth watching s5, cause in the end theyre gonna escape... regret watching it I would have given 9/10. It ticks so many boxes for pure entertainment. Interesting plots. Good acting. Great sets. Great camera work. Dialogue??? Hmm... I get the philosophy, but there are a few too many moments which are just plain stupid and ridiculous where you have to suspend rational and logical thinking. Happy to do that when I'm watching science fiction. I was loving it until I kept coming across those stupid moments. If you are happy to ignore those moments, you will love it. Wow. How to ruin a great series. Over edited, too dramatised, and dragging out whatever was left of a story. Season 4 is awful. It was already an unbelievable story, but it was entertaining. Season 4 just takes it far into ridiculousness. Season 1 its a 9
Season 2 maybe 7-8
3 its a 5
and season 4 its a full mess. Maybe a 2.
So many random stuff.
In a scene there are 4 guys with automatic rifles in a open space, and cant hit the guy who do a roll like a video games to dodge the bullets.
There is another scene in a hall exactly the same. Same guy in the middle, open hall, being shot by 3 diferent angles by 4-5 guys, and no one hit.
Even call of duty its more realistic than this.
The crew are idiots 90% of the time, and super brillant the other 10%, no middle point. First time in my life I feel like that for a serie. The first two season are great. This has an Awful screenplay and a lot of fake scenes. Nothing to do with the robbery.
They are trying to make robbers heroes The last season was terrible, unnecessary and pretty bad and a respect with a first and second season a big disappointment The last season destroyed this Serie. All long and romantic dialogues with out sense. It gradually became a soap opera. This happens when you pressure writers to do something that was already ending. The story is very good, but the direction is very bad. The scene that Gandía is shot by more than 100 machine gun shots and not a drop of blood does come close to ridicule. To make matters worse, in the next scene a pistol shot is capable of knocking him down. I had to write another review.<br/><br/>This is insulting writing. / plot. After seeing the fabulous Ozark season 3 it is hard to cope with Casa de Papel sesaon 4 and its repeating receipes.
The Numerous psychological and historical asides get boring in the middle of the action.
Anyway, for a European series I can still give it a 6 😉
Let's go for season 5 then and see how it all ends ! Well, usually when you watch these kind of movies, you start empathize all the parties, because if you are in this kind of situation you understand people need to act somehow to stay alive.
1. Arthuro was the weirdest persona, nobody could understand his role, although he kept creating a mess without being held responsible or at least to be tide up.
2. Nairobi keeps causing lots of trouble, which is definitely unrealistic; something like when they have to escape and there is a few minutes left, they are wondering around with the young guy.
3. Sometimes the group holds meetings, and at that point all the hostages are at the lobby without any surveillance, they could just press the button and open the door to go.
4. There to guards in front of the toilet door, and the hostages talking, using types, etc... and nobody notices.
5. The all movie is like puzzle, well thought although there small small stupid mistakes, that has nothing to do with the fact that "it is just a movie".<br/><br/>There would be so many points to add up, however it is enough I guess. I stopped watching from the very beginning of the third season as I realized that because of that stupid young couple, something wired is about to happen. The first two seasons were amazing but after that the show is extremely bad.. I can't believe that people say this is one of the greatest shows.The plot is very bad, the dialogues awful and some of the characters such as Palermo and Tokyo are very annoying.. Season 04 is absolutely and utterly dismal, disappointing and dreadful. Nothing significant happens throughout the season, except the usual shenanigans. I chose to ignore all the flaws but this season has wore my patience thin.<br/><br/>I would like to say the show has always been predictable. Over the years, writers have made horrendous choices.
<ul><li>Professor falling in love with the inspector.</li><li>Professor adding Tokyo to the team, when she can ruin the plan anytime.</li><li>Killing Berlin and subjecting us to those horrible flashbacks</li><li>Bringing Arturo back into the mix so he can basically be annoying and serve no other purpose.</li><li>Killing Nairobi, brace yourselves for more flash-backs in season 05.</li></ul><br/><br/>These are just some of the main plot points and does not thousands of cliches and repetitive dialogues and actions of the same characters. The actions don't make sense and it is not as a viewer. It is clearly written for moments rather than logic or common sense. This could just have been about a heist, instead the writers over-complicated everything and dragged into the realms of a drama.<br/><br/>This season was clearly a filler with lots and lots of pointless scenes and was a bold move ending it on cliffhanger when everyone already knows Professor is going to live and the plan will succeed except for few hurdles here and there. Netflix has produced a lot of great shows and this is not one of them. Big fan of s 1 and s 2, spanish production, good idea, out of many cliches of the American industry. But s4 is complete crap. Full of nonsense, plot holes, and cringe moments. Why do you put so many caracters if you cannot even develop one of them? Tokyo and Rio are so cringe, terrible actors that keep overreacting all the time. Nairobi died when she was the only caracter that could have had a chance to be a good part of the whole disaster. Only Marseille and Berlin are good caracters, all the others are just cringe, screaming and crying all the time. Gandia looks like superman, he cannot die, even after 1000 round shot at him and a grenade exploded behind him. Wow. And why all the flashbacks? Nothing happens in the first 6 episodes, they dont show the actual heist, no tension, to suspence, nothing. You see 3 scenes on repeat, for 5 hours. Another problem, why all the gay scenes, the trans Julia, not even played by an actual trans Actor, just why? Its embarrassing. Did they do it just for the image and to have more follow-up??? And if the professor is such a genius, how could a pregnant woman, with one phone call and a license plate, find the professors location and get into it? Door wasnt locked? No alarm sistem? No camera? Nothing? Wow. Id rather watch some Disney movie, Bambi was more realistic, and for sure less cringe. Don't watch if you wanna stay triggered all day long. I'm a big fan of season 1 and 2. Good and original idea, spanish producion ( not the usual american cliché crap ) and good plot. But since Netflix decided to buy the series, it all went down. S4 is complete nonsense, lacks of olot Although I voted 10 in the rest seasons, I vote 7 in the 4th one just because the end was to be continued! I'd prefer the end of the circle in a way!
Hey, we love casa de papel!!!!We'll watch it anyway!!! Don't leave us in the middle!!! 😇😋😜 I loved first season and the final of the third (which gave me the energy to try the fourth season)<br/><br/>No spoiler, just fake fiction: slow story after the idea of the first season, predictable, action show with no action The series "Money Heist" is a netflix original in Spanish but language is not a barrier anymore as the subbed & dubbed versions are readily accepted by viewers worldwide due to its thrill, suspense, unique plot & the costume of the robbers for sure. The story portrays a man known as "Professor" who comes up with an extremely perfect plan of a heist by assembling some criminals who excel in some fields. The heist includes taking over one of the largest banks in Spain and bringing out huge amount of money from it but whose money is being stolen that is the biggest surprise. The events taking place inside the bank with the hostages and the "robbers" alongside the situations being handled by the Professor and the cops and intelligence outside the bank has created a masterpiece whose final outcome is still left to be revealed in the upcoming seasons. Amazing series...perfection in every episode...watched it till episode "Bella Ciao"...for me it was the best ending....gonna watch additional episode netflix produced. Story starts great and remains fairly suspenseful over first 2 seasons but in last few episodes pace slows down. Only reason this doesn't get 9/10 from me is because story becomes illogical over time. Everybody does dumb things. Robbers get lucky all the time. Hence I have decided to not watch third season onwards.<br/><br/><ul><li>SPOILERS -</li></ul>Hundreds of police cannot shoot one Tokyo on bike. Many scenes have all robbers in one room busy when hostages could have simply opened front door and walked out but didn't. Monica, Angel, and Raquel characters change so much in so brief interactions that they give up their whole life and own sense of righteousness and help robbers. Monica and Raquel have excuse of 5 day love but somehow (even at cost of daughter!) Angel also sides with robbers without trying to understand anything. Professor spent whole life planning heist can falls head over heels in love in 1 day? What was his goal in first day offering charger if he didn't want to be close to Inspector? Why didn't he disengage when he realised his growing love? And robbers get lucky so many times that police actions seems laughable. When hostages escape first time around what stopped them from bombing that door open again? Berlin is able to hold on to tens of police alone. In last escape from hanger scene everyone is wasting time on sentimentality but somehow gets ready and out just a minute before. Professor left Island clue for Raquel even though she was police and somehow was convinced that she would side with him. I could name more but you get the gist ... One of the best Neflix series I have ever seen. An amazing story with twists and turns that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Incredible character development and the acting is top notch! You will gasp, laugh, cry and fall in love! It is the best series i have ever watched. The professor played his role so perfectly that i am amazed and not to forget BERLIN what a brilliant actor he is. And the story plot just wow. Everyone justified their role so perfectly that not a single flaw in series. Eagerly waiting for season 4. This series is very fast paced from the start. Slows down a bit throughout the middle of the first series but allows you to learn more about each character. The backstories and bond between the characters is what makes you keep watching. The show is slow paced and yet somehow fast paced at the same time. There's a lot of action throughout that keeps you on your toes. It just keeps getting better and better. Lacasa De Papel (Money Heist)<br/><br/>One of the best series that I had watched till date!<br/><br/>Their screenplay and character development are so much impressive!!!<br/><br/>Part 1 was eye opening.
Part 2 was ice breaker.
Part 3 was the reckoning!!!<br/><br/>Part 4 is coming in April 2020!!!<br/><br/>Currently available in Netflix. Simply WOW ! Kudos to the mind of the makers, storyline, cast, I don't mind it could get better than, you won't believe what I am telling you, once you see the first few episodes you get addicted to it and won't take a break even for a minute. I've just seen it for 24 hours still I am not sleepy, when you see the one episode your hunger increases to 100% and you wish that may this series continues permanently and you keep watching it, it couldn't get better than this. Actually I am bewildered to those who gave/give 9/10 haha! frustrating! Can you imagine for a better series than this! 10 is far less for such a masterpiece. I really appreciate the whole team. (Love You)
(Professor) (Berlin) Signed up just to write this comment.<br/><br/>Season 1 is great with its mastermind robbery but it gets really annoying by tokio character keeps ruining everything with her improvisation in the following season. Not really best acting either.
My advise is to watch it as a white noise on your tv not for the thrill, let alone for the plot. You'll get annoyed and ended up doing house chores. Incredible direction and story makes it special. If you haven't seen that yet, you may have lost many many things. Its the best money heist series ever !! Incredibly acting , tension level is high & it will explode adrenaline in your veins !! The script is magical and unexpected Definitely not a 8.5
It's good in places, but unrealistic and drag almost all the way, except the last two episodes of season 2. I don't understand a sudden rush at the end with dumb plots. Unwanted love interests, which is cringeworthy. Just wanted to finish watching it.<br/><br/>I mean you'll love it as a potboiler, popcorn series, but if you are looking for excellence, intriguing series, this is not the one. My first rating was a solid 10. I gave it while I was on Part 2. But then I just had to come back and change it to 6. None of it is as remotely intriguing as it was in the first 2 seasons with lots of boring and unnecessary drama,''cool" act of Monica and Raquel and, of course Netflix had to homosexualise it as much as possible, no surprise here.<br/><br/>Started off very good :( I think the show is overrated.The concept and idea is great but it just gets really dumb as the show goes on. The makers weren't clear of their audience s I guess and have added a lot of unnecessary stuff.For me,the series just had too many flaws! It's been a long time since I've seen a show in this genre this good. Was into it until the very end. I don't know why some people are so thoughtlessly giving it a 1/10 rating but I have to say I really like this series and I think many other people enjoy watching it. The acting in this show is just unbelievable.
Hands down one of the best shows i've ever seen. 24 hours series has nothing on this one. This is other level storytelling on a format of a series. Superbly well written, masterfully directed and produced with complex characters and a narrative full of hooks that never let go, they always know how to grab you to keep seeing all unfold.
This is what good American action series and even movies wish and dream they could be!!! Not many now a days can compete with Money Heist.
In matters of action and character it's in its own league. This series will be forever remembered cause nothing made in America can match in quality this masterpiece!! I really believe it is one in all the factors stated above. Good from the start. But then it's just the same and the same and the same. Best series
better than game of thrones(just because of season8)
the last ep was better than ned stark execution Excellent new concept.<br/><br/>Season 1 is a kind of enjoyable warm-up.
Season 2 has many explosive fun moments! Definitely "bingeable"!<br/><br/>All in all, S1 and S2 are a lot of enjoyable fun.
Sure, some plot holes, but La Casa de Papel never pretended to be dead serious!
This is a take-it-easy show, as the "incredible" that is happening is fortunately
forgotten thanks to riveting scenes and action. 9/10.<br/><br/>Season 3 : euh... what happened?
Netflix took over from S3, is that the Netflix effect?
Did the authors think "Ok, Netflix poured so much money in this, we don't need to care anymore"?
S3 looks like La Casa went from fun and original to just... industrial. This is basically a remake of S1 ; but a lot doesn't make sense at all ; while S3 tries its best to stir up feelings, that doesn't work as much of it is anticipable, and, unfortunately, not interesting.
Hopefully S4 will better? As good as S2? Surprisingly Fantastic plot. A show which literally makes you binge watch the complete season in one go. This show is literally a best example of how one can go in detail and come out with a fantastic story which is true to life. Enjoyed series only thing that spoilt it was the English voices they used,was like watching an old karate film from 60's and 70's.I normally wouldn't watch it for that reason alone but it had me gripped early on,so give it a go I think you will be surprised. This was a fun series. Fun from the beginning and doesn't takes itself too serious. This has been much better than many of the recent Hollywood series' released in recent years. Acting is good but the voice overs seemed odd at times. Maybe it added to the enjoyment of the series. Give it a shot of 5 episodes. I wasnt as thrilled with the 4 th season, however. Lately I was thinking to watch some different genre of series, where I found this series. Just gave it a start, believe the screenplay and the story is so gripping I was watching continuously till season 2. I really recommend this series for who are craving for thrilling heist experience. I agree: truly masterpiece and You will never know whats coming next, like the usual action tv series. You will expect one turn but whats coming next will oposite. Thats truly wounderful art of work and performance. As Alison said at a time, 8 ppl went to rob "la casa de papel". A genius guy who is planning this in every detail choose 'these' people to do the job! They're all psychologically destroyed. Was he (the Professor) blind to see it? The world is approximately 4.543 billion years and we should be blessed to be alive when Money Heist was created. Finally I've watched something to get rid of Game of Thrones disappointment. The story and details represented for performing the heist was absolutely marvelous, but the loose ends of romanticism displayed by quiet a few characters is what deteriorated the standard of the show.Still worth the time!! Acting is on the highest level! Every character is well developed, you feel character's emotions and what they are going through. There is lots of action going on, making audience almost "addicted" to the show. Love it! 10/10 One of the greatest show ever and obviously the greatest heist show. The actors, directors, writers everyone have done a tremendous job. It takes lot of effort to make this kind of thrillers. The music is like cherry on the cake, though I can't understand the lyrics much but the composition is just so good. The way every tiny detail has been covered in this show is really fascinating. Not much nudity, not much vulgarity, just pure intelligence, brilliant story, brilliant screenplay, brilliant dialogues wholesome entertainment. And it just gets better and better from part one to part 2 and then part 3 is even better. I can't just wait for part 4 to come. Super good series, with a lot of excitement an never boring. Men and women will love this! Again a super good Spanish series after seen the extreme good series Gran Hotel, Velvet and Vis a Vis. Superb, marvellous, interesting......etc ,
I told you one think you can't stop this series.. after seeing one episode..!!! From my perspective this is one of the most entertaining and exciting tv series that I have seen in 50 years. And thank god it did not come from the English speaking studios that fall into the same repetitious pattern of predictable boredom. The cast is beyond stunning, the plot intriguing and the acting beyond reasonable expectation. I'm usually overly critical and cynical I always look for the obvious to break the story to no more than an average reality that the plot tries to over represent. Can't do it this time despite the cultural difference. Though I have to admit I keep looking, but this is too good. Woderful, Great, Unbelievable, Excellent, The best ever, Mind blowing Watching in original language could be important as the English dubbing is atrocious. After 4 or 5 episodes I turned on subtitles and there are a lot of different dialogue which leads me to believe the subtitle translation is more true to original language version. The dubbing would appear to have been Americanised and makes the very often implausible plot more stupid.
Other than so many implausible scenes, it can be a bit slow and boring for a crime/action show.
Over all if you can't watch in native tongue there are better shows to waste a few days on. Money Heist is one of the best robbery based story with gripping screenplay and memorable characters.<br/><br/>This show open up with a gang who were going to rob a mint in Spain. The whole story runs inside the four walls of the mint. The story primarily consists of male protagonist who is called as The Professor by his gang members who are involved in the robbery. Being smart and known for his leadership skills, The Professor trains his gang of loyalists in various kinds of skills like forgery, security, human psychology, strategies and deception that are required for robbery for five months at a deserted villa which is located outside Madrid before attempting the final robbery.<br/><br/>Lead artists have performed their characters at best and made memorable to audience. Each character has flaws and story presents glimpse of their past lives in between robbery to understand why they had to participate in the robbery.<br/><br/>This show primarily consists of two seasons, with eight episodes in each season. Third season was produced later on by Netflix due to show's popularity. The heist shouldn't have taken two seasons. A lot of irrelevant content after the six episodes. However, I was hooked and finished the two seasons. It should have ENDED after season two.<br/><br/>Season 3? Totally unnecessary! They forced the entire season. I wanted to stop watching after episode 2/3. Speechless cliffhanger endings to each episode but the part 3 finale was amazing that made part 3 of money heist just amazing the way everything is played out all throughout the show from part 1 to part 3 is so smart and amazing. Overall great show The story keeps you holding it is written and directed so well that you will fall in love with the series season 3 end is just the best hoping the next season i.e part 4 to be upto the mark One of the best TV shows I've watched so far. Excellent work .. It is the best spanish series at the moment but some events in the series are just stupid and "Science Fiction" the series has a lot of spanish love and the action is really stupid at some times
But the series contains a lot of situation twists an it and keeps you with "The Breath in your Mouth". The content is really exciting! The storyline is good. However, there is way too much drama and unprofessional behavior for even a guy like the Professor to pull off...
It's a case of conflicting motivations. They are attempting to be precision Type A always on personality jobs being accomplished by type B slackers. Socialism's number one believers. It's a really cool thing they are doing. It's just entirely unrealistic that those people could pull it off.
Another common case of taking away from the type of character and devotion to craft it would take to excel in this area. People that could do this don't make mistakes. They don't bicker and fight amongst each other. Think mission impossible, James Bond, Thomas crown affair, the Italian job.
These are the kinds of people that screw off at work, use their phones 1/4 to 1/2 the shift, groan and mope if something unexpected comes and it gets busy. Don't go out of their way to help the boss if he asks. Definitely always wondering why they don't get pay raises more often. Etc etc.
The writer is trying to get out of that category but I have to call BS on Rio getting caught for using a phone. They could call each other daily for 3 hours a day using prepaid phones. The satellite phones are a whole different story, not that they needed them. Not because they could have any possible way of knowing that Rio had the phone it was third party. Then they would be using prepaid sat phone Sims. So no chance they would know. It was just lazy. It's a good show but not great! It took them 2Seasons to escape then they spend just 2 episodes on 3rd season to be right back inside another robbery only because they refuse to think. Don't get me wrong, I liked the series but they could have honestly just made a movie...it didn't need 3 seasons to tell it.
The characters are cute, their background stories relatable to some but it won't be for everyone. The Romantic elements didn't seem forced just reckless, who falls inLove with the person holding them hostage, really now! Spoiler Free
Just finished watching the first 7 episode within a day ðŸ¤£ It is not a show for the purist. It is not a perfect show! But, is it still worth watching? Yes, for the entertainment. It keeps you on the edge, you want to know what is going to happen next. It is one of those guilty pleasures like Game of Thrones or eating an extra cheese pizza. It has its low. The background story of each character gets a bit boring. The writers need to define each character, agreed. But, we are in a middle of a Heist! I thought the tempo keeps dropping here and there. But, overall it has that feel good feeling. Bunch of losers dreaming to get rich buy committing a crime. Most of them come out as amateur robbers and are careless and casual, they don't look like professional going about their business with absolute focus barring their.... Hush! Do not want to give away any spoilers. If you can overlook the imperfections, it is surely a show worth watching. You will fall in love with the characters. Let me know who is your favorite! The reason why i really liked this show it was because i could relate easily to the characters.<br/><br/>Especially Berlin.I could relate to him in so many occasions and that made the show 1000 times better.<br/><br/>The characters are interesting,original and not annoying.<br/><br/>The plot is beyond amazing.It's extremely well written with many thoughts and hidden insights.<br/><br/>The overall atmosphere is incredible with good color grading and good camera angles<br/><br/>I recommend this show without hesitation.<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>Summary<br/><br/><ul><li>Characters interesting,original and not annoying.</li><li>The plot is extremely interesting and well written</li><li>The overall atmosphere is incredible with good color grading and good camera angles</li></ul>etc,<br/><br/>Other than that this show is a solid 10/10 Every character is nicely written
And Berlin is so amazing, Berlin is best written character in the show.
Sometimes you feel that they are overreacting or story is not on the trail but it is just for few seconds otherwise the whole show is amazing It started out a little slow, but after a few episodes the story really starts to get interesting. The two intertwining storylines of the robbers inside the mint and the professor dealing with the police, each facing problems, is exhilarating. At the end of an episode you'll often think: are they gonna make it? Did the professor forsee this? Seeing the police's perspective as well was very interesting. An action-packed, well-written storyline, with good acting.
Definitely worth a watch. I heard about the series and realized that it was very good. It was hard for me to start seeing this series because the series in Spanish and the language is foreign to me, but I did not let it stop me from seeing what it was about and it was a fantastic and classic series and I started to see the first, second, third episode and I wanted more and more.
Wow, excellent series, excellent actors, excellent investment, excellent decor. There are small things that bothered me, but I do not know if it's just me who is so meticulous. In any case, it is not relevant to detail here as long as it is not something that harms my viewing experience and the quality of the series! I fell in love with some of the characters, fell in love with the Spanish language.
Can not wait for the third season. Testing and testing testing testing testing testing DARPHANE EVIMIZ,BERLIN BABAMIZ.
AksIyon,zeka,dram ne ararsanIz var Eine der besten Serien die ich je gesehen habe... sehr sehr spannend. ;) This serie os awesome , always the americans try to belittle the work of other countries . Is DISGUSTING ALL THE PEOPLE WHO VOTE 2 OR 1 OR 3 DISGUSTING!!!! It the best thing that I have ever watched because I think that it's so different from the others The story is great, just like the heroes, acting. But the impression is that after writing or shooting about 5 or 6 episodes as a whole, for some reason it was decided to extend this series artificially and so they added a whole bunch of "philosophical" dialogues and speeches, which mostly have nothing to do with the main great (!) story line, thus turning this show into a total of 15 episodes!<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this is totally worth watching (often fast-forwarding the long talks :) ) ... When the climax is reached? The show starts as a masterpiece. I am still binge watching and almost done with season 2.
The show would be a perfect one season show. I would have given a 9 - they don't deserve 10 because of the plot holes. But season 2 is just too much. It doesn't get boring, but it just takes too long to end the story. Loved everything about it except the death of Berlin if he would have lived this would the greatest show ever. That being said the show was spectacular, ending was beautiful. 9.99/10 only because of Berlin. Now I know who the bad guys really are. Still deserves 10/10 This was my first foreign tv show , I thought it was a good show , however I had enough of listening to Spanish by the end of season 2 ! Worth giving it a go .. Another robbery of national bank etc. Another police tent with military and policemen. Another character returns like Tokyo did in previous seasons. Another team member dies. Another downfall and as usual season ends in the middle of everything. Come on!!! Do something different than previous seasons!!!!! You can watch it, but it is pretty unrealistic and makes no sense... sometimes it's like WTF, how!!? But it's a good story It reminded me of HIMYM, where you got more and more the Feeling that they are extending the plot to make more episodes and more Money. I liked the Music, the general idea and some Pictures. Tokio coming back (not getting shot by a bunch of snipers riding the motrocykle back in?!?!?!), the relationship between raquel and salva,the two stockholm-Syndroms. too many flashbacks, american-style Shooting Scenes with thousands of rounds and None hitting the target... all that spoiled a potential 8/10 Rating. i Only continued after 8 episodes because i had gotten that far.... This series is one of the best series I've ever seen, the script and the acting was incredible. Just watched tonight at the end of this Spanish production, which had a priority in my list since it began to be broadcast on TV in Spain, the final conclusion is that it was really very good.<br/><br/>The first episode captures us, holds us in this game of chess that begins soon by promising so much, with this will endure a 2 or 3 episodes that follow without the same adrenaline and perfection, until we conquer again and arrest us again inside the paper house.
Until the end.<br/><br/>I could understand the little frustration you can feel because either in the script, or in the work and interpretation of one or another character the thing has not been at the level it deserved, what could take this production to almost perfection, but we canÂ´t focus on the failures or defects of something so good.<br/><br/>So many entrancing characters, a plot full of drama and vibrant adrenaline, very well crafted.<br/><br/>Always with great suspense.<br/><br/>The best that has been seen in recent years, whether in movies or TV series, has come from various latitudes but less and less from Hollywood.<br/><br/>the eclipse of Hollywood allows more and more people to realize this quality and open their horizons, itÂ´s the positive sign to withdraw, to see more and more people seeing high quality productions from other countries, continents and languages.<br/><br/>Final note, an eight that could well have reached nine or even ten, because there was so much potential for that. After i watch 6 episode of season 1, I can say is boring to watch. No intense. Not worth of watching. Amazing Extraordinary remarkable exceptional wonderful marvelous sensational phenomenal Series. I loved it. Love You Professor, even you hate some during the series but in the end you will cry, believe me this series is amazing, it's about love, pain. You will love everyone's acting, especially Professor and Berlin are everything of this Series.<br/><br/>Must Watch and recommend it to your best friends. Oh, common. This is more like a money heist perpetrated by the LOST producers. You are in the final episode and the turbine of the plane that crashed in the first episode is still spinning. Common. I don't get the hype over this. Try it, if you like, you are with the majority. I tried 4 times and this won't work for me. Good show, The professor reminds me of Light Yagami from Death Note Hate it! Bad cinematography, bad writing, bad acting....how is this show rated so highly? Feels like a polished Indian tv series with some twists. Disappointed. Seasons 1 and 2 were excellent, bordering on brilliant. The concepts were novel and well executed, the acting was quite good, the story line was taut and often exciting. Those seasons reflected a very European/Spanish approach. Season 3, however, is a bitter disappointment - it was "Americanized" so that now many scenes are pointless sex, needless violence, dialogue from the gutter for no good or artistic reason. I watched seven of the episodes of season 3 but got so disgusted that I walked away from the finale.
What changed? I have no idea, but my guess is that the writers thought they had to pitch Season 3 to an American audience that is used to - and perhaps demands - mindless action, adolescent sex scenes, crude language, and a weak plot. Seasons 1 and 2 are well worth the time; as stated they border on brilliant. Season 3, however, is pure trash. Don't bother with it. If I could rate the seasons separately, I'd give Season 1 a 9, Season 2 an 8.5, and Season 3 a 3. 3rd season nicely directed but thats all. Story is childish even for a Sci fi enthusiast. A Spanish mini-series more than holds up to the best heist movies of all time. Great plot, great characters and intense sequences throughout. Thoroughly enjoyed, you will too! Cheap entertainment. Lazy script, completly inverosimil scenes. I've did'nt understood why Tokio act like that. What's her problem?. Was very good idea, but completly wasted. Straight to the point, this is very bad made, plot holed, over-dramatic, make-no-sense-at-all show. Its a complete waste of Your time, every "mind game" or twist shown has almost no sense or any base. I can bring over 20 plot holes easily, but I won't make spoilers on a review.<br/><br/>Please, make yourself a favor, stay out of this. After wrapping up all the 22 episodes in a week or so, I must say I was surprised about how much it had delivered. It's not just a shallow heyst plot exercise like so manny others that came before. Even my previously favorite heyst movie - Ocean's 11 - does not make it to the likes of La Casa de Papel (although it has a somewhat similar vibe to it).
La Casa de Papel gets you full character development and empathy with any regular human, flawed and imperfect. I read on a previous review here that it made no sense that the perfect heyst had so many flawed execution on the characters part, but hey, that's life, that's what gets it interesting. <br/><br/>Refreshing to see this kind of production coming from any other country than US or UK. On this case "nuestros hermanos" espaÃ±oles (I am from Portugal), present a credible spanish reality that I can relate to because there's plenty of familiarity on the characters created. So in that sense I am biased on liking it, but that's not significant for acknowledging how well it was executed! I only have to add the following, written on a similar tone as Nairobi would say:
 
Â¡joder! el mas grande puÃ±etero programa de televisiÃ³n de la puta madre del carajo del siglo! Â¡coÃ±o! Unbelievable. Phenomenal acting, superb plot and overall amazing. No series has ever hooked me with an interest so great such as this one - and I don't even speak Spanish! I found this to be an extremely good series, and can hardly compare it to many others. I would strongly recommend any other person to watch this series, as it's suspense and excitement keeps you clicking 'next episode' as you are filled with adrenaline. It truly is impossible to sleep through or get bored of this series. Non-violent action-thrilling-love-suspense experience. Great characters. Great plot.I want more Netflix has a knack for knowing what its viewers would like. I didn't think so when I saw this title keep popping up on the home screen. I ignored it for a good 2-3 weeks before I bit the bullet. After all, I'm learning Spanish so why not get a little vocab practice, right? The first episode took some adjusting to; this is the first (but not last) Spanish-language TV show I've seen. Patiently watch the first 2-3 episodes then you'll be rewarded with a ride like nothing you've experienced before. I was on the edge of my seat - all without the usual tropes used in English-language shows. It was a wholesome kind of experience. I can't explain it any other way. Do yourself a favour - if you have the day off, block out 8 hours to finish Part 1. Then ask your boss for another day off to power through Part 2. I'm not a bingewatcher these days, but the cliffhangers in this show make it impossible to wait! One of those tv series that leave you stucked to the chair starring at the screen after its over with the feeling that you dont believe it came to an end Brilliant!
Havn't binge watched anything like this since BB! I would say this is one of my top 5 tv series i've ever watched. It starts with a good plot. The acting is perfect and there are no random/boring scenes to just extend the episodes. I watched all the episodes in something like 3 days, very interesting. If you are bored and want something to watch, watch this! You'll not regret! Let's make everyone equal without harming anyone. Though economists won't agree. But this isn't for them. I'm a young entrepreneur and watching this gave me lots of life lessons. Research, imagine, modify, reimagine and implement. A must watch ! Leaving out the fact that this, is one of the greatest things Spain ever made (after some horror films), I must say that I wasn't fully satisfied about some logics during the episodes. "El Professor" obviously was the most intelligent character of the series, but some dynamics they were left to chance. Fortunatly, everything ended up to his advantage, but I hoped that nothing was by chance, like I said. Apart from that, the final left me a little bit down, like many others because during the episodes they made me fond of the characters for leaving me with too many questions. Anyway, I really enjoyed it and hope it's not the last season! The series went well at first the idea was original and inelligent but the episodes were a bit boring . WARNING - SOME MINOR SPOILER, BUT NO MAJOR SPOILERS. NOTHING THAT WILL RUIN YOUR EXPERIENCE OF WATCHING THE SHOW<br/><br/>I just finished watching the show. I am truly struggling to find the words that do full justice to the show.<br/><br/>I am afraid one cannot go into this review without going into some basic details of the plot. So a person collects together a group of robbers and they aim to rob whatever is the place in Spain where money is printed.<br/><br/>Naturally there is a plan in place where they have worked out all the outcomes and issues that could potentially arise and how to deal with them. Then the game begins. For it is a game, cops and robbers.<br/><br/>This may seem similar to a lot of shows and films that have been done. However for what it is worth, it is far superior to any of those shows. For a start the story has so much depth that its hard to believe they fit all that in, in just 15 episodes.<br/><br/>Every robber has a unique character and its own character development arc, each with its own twists and turns. Then there are the hostages and a lot of them have their own story arcs and how it affects the outcome of the hostage situation.<br/><br/>Lastly there is the story arc of some of the policemen involved. How having to deal with the hostage situation takes a toll on them. The no. of little stories that this show covers is insane. Each of these little stories eventually leading to the climax.<br/><br/>Then there is near top of the stuff acting from nearly everyone, especially the lead actor who I won't name here, because in so many actors why give away who the lead was in the review. Just watch for yourself.<br/><br/>Naturally like with every show there were bits that I enjoyed more and some bits that I felt could have been better. However I don't want to go into those because they would be major spoiler territory. Suffice it to say that the list of whatever bits I didn't enjoy, is a very short one.<br/><br/>I feel I must give this warning not to go in expecting a big gimmicky robbery story with a 'twist' ending. I will even say outright that there is no big twist ending or a big surprise reveal or anything of that sort.<br/><br/>The show doesn't cheat you. Like for instance some shows just hide a whole side of the story or give away bits selectively so as to manipulate the viewers and set up a twist finish trying to seem clever that way. This show lays its cards out fully before you and you know exactly who is who and who is doing what.<br/><br/>That is where the fun lies, you as the viewers know the full picture and then you see how different characters react in a tough situation, which will either help the guys you were rooting or disrupt their plans. Then you watch those whose plans were disrupted struggle with the situation they find themselves in.<br/><br/>This show is more a drama then a typical con or heist film. So shed whatever stereotypes you have about such films or shows when you watch. The show will not disappoint. A TV show that glorifies bank robbery filled with sexual escapades. Wow. What a theme to capture viewers and audience. I saw only the 1st season complete, after 2nd Season Ep 1, I switched to Dark, and I am not disappointed at all. Its a shame they want to release more seasons of this horrible series. Ok. First of all it's very slow and unrealistic. It gets boring over time due to dramatic personal experiences. Why they have directed season 3 and 4 God knows. Season 1 and 2 was really good. After that show became a nonsense woke mess. Abort, abort I started watching the series as it appears on my Netflix wall as India's most watched series. Could not watch it post season 2. Part 1: "La Casa de Papel" is one of the most binge-worthy shows Netflix offers. It is a nerve-wrecking, lightning-paced and full of twists and turns, both ridiculous and smart. It requires the highest suspension of belief; with these expectations, the bar is set and met. It sets up for what must be an epic Part 2.<br/><br/>Part 2: Part 2 is equally as action-packed, ridiculous, and entertaining as the Part 1. As the show rampages towards an epic finale, the stakes are increased, tensions deepen, and the pacing quickens. The show also has a powerful social message, terrific acting, a soundtrack worth repeating, and enough cliffhangers to leave the most ardent viewer glued to Netflix for hours.<br/><br/>Part 3: Part 3 starts slow, but develops into another fantastic and unpredictable season. While the show inherits the faults of the previous two seasons, it also retains the strengths to set up what will surely be a nerve-wrecking Part 4.<br/><br/>Part 4: While Part 4 of "La Casa de Papel" is full of twists and cliffhangers, it feels like a 'middle chapter' season. The first three seasons were a cat-and-mouse game between the government and the team, with us rooting for both, this one removes the grey area. It feels as if the creators have lost focus on what made the first three seasons resonate; like the battle of wits between the two sides, the moral trappings of supporting either side, and the social allegories. Instead, the focus of Part 4 is simply to create as many shocking moments as possible. After watching the first full season I'm baffled as to why this has such a high praise and rating. This show is good and solid but only till the end of the first episode. After that it slides down quite a slope. The only people that can potentially like it, is overly emotional ones that disregard anything remotely resembling common sense and logic.
It is a dumb, that's all I can say. Doesn't make any sense at all. It's rather a snooze fest Do you remember the movie Inside Man? This is what a professional leap looks like. What we will see on the screen is an inept attempt to copy an idea. Several months of robbery planning take their head by stupid mishaps. Errors that nobody would make after planning for several days. Artificially generated problems. And the scene where the hostage acquires a weapon without a magazine, reloads and targets the attacker. ðŸ¤£ embarrassment. I'm extremely impressed with the plot and cliffhangers that occur every episode. Starting Part 3 now and haven't lost interest. Amazing producing. All things which were alluring in seasons 1 and 2 (8 or 9/10) have disappeared in this new season coming out of the Netflix Meat-Mincer Machine (they do this with every successful show, once they take over, as in Lilyhammer, for instance).
The seductive presence of the Professor, always composed, with his razor-mind always one step ahead of things, now has turned into a conventional man heading a theft as many others.
The very well paced and interesting relationship with the hostages now has become sparse, thinner and less relevant.
The cliches and flagship gestures which were innovative in the previous seasons now seem an overcooked repetition of resources in a less effective context.
The fascinating cat-mouse liaison between the Professor and the Inspector now has been replaced by the typical bedroom rows and marital power quarrels.
And then the disgusting, terribly acted pregnant detective, what was that character mean to add? In any case, she hasn't done it.<br/><br/>Instead of the good things, they have injected the show with a contemporary American idea of what "action" means: frantic, blasting music overscoring every dialogue and every scene at top volume (you have to turn it down and up every minute because it's really bothersome) and frantic people shouting their lungs out at every sentence. No nuances, no finesse this time.<br/><br/>Also, the "ideology" element and the politically correct agenda seem so force-fed and poorly justified that they make you sigh. Didn't they know that powerful countries tortured people before Rio's detention? Didn't they care until then?<br/><br/>Rodrigo de la Serna saves the day with his excellent performance as usual. But the rest is a disappointment. It lacks originality. The sequence, characters, actions, conflicting have been seen umpteen times in better execution. There are surprising moments, but unfortunately too few.
The action scenes fail completely, because they're simply unbelievable, like some of the protagonists' actions. And it's very prosy. The 2nd season is really boring, only in the last episode there is some tension again.<br/><br/>Bad version of "Inside Man", was just annoyed. But Berlin reconciled me in the end. What remains in my positive memory is the music!
3season - no thanks. Its a good series... Edgy, slick, full of twists and turns...All actors are good except Ursula Corbero. She is loud n artificial. Alba Flores should have been the main actress...She is fantastic. So is Alvaro Morte. This movie is awesome full of awareness and consciousness, hat down and bowed hands for all tge staff behind this marvellous work 🙏 This is the best, I like everything.But I wait for part. 4 to end this.NO SPOILERS Donting robbery every season, the tightening. A great PARTISAN series Ain't end yet.season 3 was more personal than the other seasons.<br/><br/>this show is doing great. Juat the most practical series i have ever watched
Kudos to the direction When i stared La casa de Papel I thought it was going to be such an incredible great show but i found out really stupid show with a lot of plotholes and some stupid love stories , this show really doesn't make any sense at all. Its very nice but Berlin died i dont exaggerate, the series is wonderful and i have never seen such a good series so far It's 4AM and I still want more! But wow just WOW. This was the best series I've ever seen. I don't even speak Spanish. How the director/creator put this together just amazes me that there's that level of brilliance out there somewhere. It's a series that will make you feel every emotion. It's a series that will make you click next episode even though you know you should be getting to bed. It's the only series that not only I've written a review for, but going to watch all over again, right away. Despite some of the more ridiculous contrivances, I appreciate how suspenseful and entertaining this series can be, and being able to keep that up through the series as well as La Casa de Papel is a great feat. Definitely a must see. This is not the typical robbery film. I have read many hard critics about the fact that the characters are dumb and make silly choices. I think that this fact males the characters more human and credible. Indeed in my opinion this makes you emphatize with them, understand them, and even want them to success. Im deeply tired of perfect-inmaculate characters, that almost make my laugh. And this show will drive you yo the edge of tears. Some scenes really seem irrelevant, some songs out of the place... But later on, suddenly, all these apparently meaningless scenes join together in a really emotional way. There were preparing you for the twist.
If you want absurdly perfect, deadly heroes, this is NOT your show. You will not find James Bond, Danny Ocean or Ethan Hunt here.<br/><br/>Bella ciao, bella ciao, bella ciao, ciao, ciao The idea is fantastic. Some actors are very good. Some parts of the episodes are so awesome.<br/><br/>There are many tech errors. The history has several holes.<br/><br/>In one episode there is a very sad song "Bella Ciao" an Italian song related to the invasion of the Nazis troops in the ww2. It's used in a very joyful moment but the real meaning is externe desperation. For this I removed 1 point to the global score. It's a severe error. This series has a very high tempo. Pedro Alonso's acting is very successful. I like this series. After watching, you will love Spanish. You start watching and you would want to finish the show ASAP, but once finished you will surely want more episodes.
Good casting, great job.
Love from india.
Ha casa de papel. I really enjoyed the show. This was good entertainment, with a really decent storyline and great acting. But it was way to long and you can feel that they streched the show artificially to get more episodes out of it. Three episodes less per season would have done the trick to keep up the excitement and i would have easily given 8 stars.<br/><br/>But all together the show is fresh, entertaining and absolutly worth binge watching. Recently I got addicted to this series and with its well thought out, brilliantly designed script and the way proper space it gave to each character cast to crawl out of the woodwork and define themselves, it was totally worth it. Despite being a high octane drama it sneaks past the barrier of your heart and sparks the dormant set of emotions which were lying around yearning to be recognised again. This is perhaps the only of its kind heist thriller which proudly defines its own standards and redefines the whole Netflix game in a new light ,while keeping the audience glued to their TV sets.
Alvaro Morte has so flawlessly blended into the character of "Professor" in this drama that it would be hard to differentiate acting from reality at times, whereas Raquel Murillo (Itziar Ituno) is an excellent actress who captures the soul of the character she played. (I had to google to know her name though but would remember now). The crazy pace this series maintains would simply boggle your mind and make you crave for more. Though reading the subtitles might make you miss the minute acts but maybe I might watch it again for this is a perfect feast in a sapiosexual manner. It's a very surprising TV show because at the beginning you can't imagine that the bank robbery will be over two seasons. Every series is enjoyable with a cliffhanger at the end. The story isn't predictable and that is fascinating. I think at the end the story is a little bit drawn-out. The TV show should be shorter to make it perfect.
Overall I think it is a hilarious TV show. Many people has many reviews i have my own . HEIST was excuted very well .I must its far more better dan any other heist i have ever seen . thank you so much for this wonderfull story i involed myself in evry which way with this story Well yeah. I've seen a couple of terrible reviews here and I really can't understand why. Haters gonna hate I guess. And they're gonna do it out of spite or to show how different or... smart they think they are compared to the rest. Don't listen to them. This show is smart, emotional, with great cinematography and acting... a great production in general. It's still a tv show, right? Are there inconsistencies and errors and "tv tricks" to move the plot along? Sure. But does it really matter? Not when a show has that heart. And it's not only the heart or the production. It's the small details, the hidden messages about socialism and society etc. And by the way, the Professor is the most bad-ass nerd ever! And even the characters you hate... you love hating them. This show is definitely the best European tv show I've ever watched and one of the best in general. My only complaint is that I'm not sure there really is a need for one more season, I kinda feel that the story ended the way it should. Nevertheless, great show! Overall, I think the show was average. I definitely got hooked into watching it through to the end because I wanted to see how it all turned out. But very early on, I realized that I needed to throw all logic and common sense out the window, otherwise I was going to start throwing things at my TV :). I feel the amount of suspension of disbelief and latitude taken here are over the top.<br/><br/><ul><li>Why didn't the police just cut power to the building? That would have immediately shutdown the money component of the heist. One might argue that a mint may have internal backup generators to counter this argument. Okay, maybe I could buy that one, but with enough capacity to run all that equipment?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>We're given the impression that the police continue to deliver meals on a regular basis, although we only technically see this being done the first time. Why would they do this?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Hostages are left alone and unsupervised through huge portions of the show. All or most of the heist crew is often seen together in the same room while the hostages are presumably in 2 or 3 separate other areas of the mint.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The whole love story between the Professor and the Inspector is so over the top.

I will watch the 3rd part because I can't help myself. Like watching an automobile accident :). I have never written a review about anything before. I've never seen the point. But this show is the most spectacular shows I have ever seen, EVER. I am honestly beside myself with how fantastically this show was written and directed. I don't normally watch shows that aren't in English because I don't like to read the subtitles, but this show is so incredible suspenseful and is woven together so perfectly and is just honestly one of the most ingenious stories I have ever seen. Absolutely fantastic. Haven't stopped watching it for 2 days straight. I accidentally stumbled upon it trying to see if Westworld was on Netflix and let me just say I'm so glad it wasn't. I almost didnt watch it deu to the language! So glad i did! Perfect tv show! Lately I've been noticing that most of the Spanish cinema that gets out there is very well-filmed, high-budget stuff, but full of obvious cliches and stereotypes. I'm both disappointed and surprised by this.<br/><br/>Except from some particular filmmakers like Almodovar or Alex de la Iglesia, I'm not sure how good Spanish cinema used to be before this new hollywoodesque era. It probably wasn't very good anyway. But it still surprises me: why are they recycling formulas that have already been taken to perfection in Hollywood decades ago and are now clearly in decline? Why not try something a bit more brave or original? Do these hollywoodesque manufactures still sell good and that is why they're doing it?<br/><br/>Anyway, about this series. It's well-filmed and well-acted. The plot all the time looks like it can get interesting, but it's really just a combination of lots of different Hollywood bank heist movies we've seen before. There are only one or two details here which seem to be original or not borrowed from somewhere else. And these details are not completely bad I must say.<br/><br/>But the characters... they are completely stereotyped and it is where this series fails the most. You have the extremely intelligent non-violent group leader who wears glasses and listens to classical music, the computer's guy, the humble welder, and two Russian tough bullies. You even have the very sexy young woman whose specific skill or role within the gang is not clear, besides looking super hot on screen. These are all characters we've seen before a million times. How can people still emphasize with these kinds of characters? However, I thought the acting was pretty good, which saves the characters from total embarrassment. Not bad good job, as i remarked there is a lack of details and missplaced scenarios a vulgaire style and bad timing control . First season was good enough. Second season is bad. There wasn't enough material for 13+9=22 episodes, it should be shorter. The story drags, and gets boring. There are too many stupid decisions, by all parties, both thieves and police. A simple example: one of the thieves examines closely, for a long time, a 100-euro bill using a magnifying glass. Why? They are using the National Mint to print those bills. Why does she have to examine it? To make sure it is not ... counterfeit??? And on top of that, this happens while one of the thieves is gravely injured and they are supposed to be in a great hurry! This is one of the many examples of stupid actions in the script, and unfortunately there are too many of those. The series starts well, a plot to pull off a spectacular robbery. However the whole thing is letdown by the subtitles. I like to watch foreign (to me) ie non-English films and tv series, in the original language. This seems to have had its subtitles translated by google as they are often clunky and bear no relation either to the original Spanish or to the English audio also provided. An example, where the chief police negotiator refers to the robbers as "heist men". Really? Could the producers not have found fluent translators to have written this stuff?
Later on it gets cliched with cookie-cutter plot lines and twists. Halfway through I am at the point where it would be as tedious to stop as go on, so I shall battle on, if only to see who's left standing at the end. Uhhh, i have a lot to say abot this serie, first of all, the plot is not interesting or its ejecuted in a really bad way, i only like 3 characthers of all the serie and there are a lot. All of the others are really stupid, all the bad things that happen it's Tokio and Rio's fault, the professor warned about relationships, they could be boyfriends after finishing work but they're so dumb that they screwed up every professor's plan. Something I do not like are the flashbacks these are not interestings and the most of ihis are Tokio getting fucked by Rio and i hate this two a lot. Everything its not bad, the opening's song its good and the animation too. Action scenes are good, and Berlin with hostages scenes are really hilarious. 
The english dub its fucking bad and the original version it's really annoying.<br/><br/>MEDIOCRE 5/10 La Casa De Papel is the best series after Breaking Bad! It's one big Antifa circle jerk. ðŸ˜‚ wtf, hilarious subversion of expectations. The professor is the resistance. How pathetic. This show is great, it has action, suspence, drama, mistery and comedy in it. 
First season (13 episodes) is available on netlix, but second season (6 episodes) isn't, although you can find it on the internet (very rough translation on english-better not to watch if you don't understand spanish at all). 
This show reminded me of one of my favourite shows, Prison Break. This movie had what promised to be an interesting twist in its subject matter but this turned out to be plain hype. I couldn't get past the first two episodes of what is an exercise in how NOT to do a series: badly-written, Amateur Hour "actors", nonsensical plot-line....the hostages must have all been praying to be the first to be shot and put out of their misery.<br/><br/>All it offers the viewer is the revelation that what you previously thought was the worst series you'd ever seen actually wasn't as bad as it could have been. This is definitely one to avoid at all costs. Just perfect ! a great plot. Amazing actors. And el Profesor ? so gorgeous ! Season three is Complete , I mean how could they put together all these nonsense ?!! Some dangerous known rubbers came back with the same face, same appearance, same bloody plan ... back to Europe, to Spain , go directly to National bank ?!? Without being known ?!!! Taking gold melting facilities with them inside the building !?!! And they are heroes among people?!? But why ?!? It's just GROSS!!!!!! Their speeches about love and humanity disgusts me ... for f..k sake this is supposed to be entertaining not a morality lesson ! The best thing on the Internet! The best thing on the Internet! The best thing on the Internet! It's a 200 episode Tele novela compressed in 20 episodes. No logic in the action of the characters, they repeat the same cycles of mistakes they have done just an episode before. People get shot, loose a lot of blood, but in 4-5 hours they are back like nothing happened. So if you like realism, you can easily avoid this waste of time. Addictive, intriguing, intense and of quality. A masterpiece of television. Its an amazing series and a mind blowing its a masterpiece! The best: The performance of all the actors, from the main ones to the occasional ones. The plot progresses continuously, there are no useless episodes for the plot. Worthy successor of the Ocean's saga.<br/><br/>The worst: The romantic plots obstruct the narrative. The moments that happen because the script dictates it. The end of the series is bad.. but the story very very good and i so sad for Berlin i hope the series more new episodes Worth watching for the story and interesting ! the direction and some scenes not good enough, some times feel you are watching Indian action movie .. When my friend told me about this TV show, I was like eeeh I won't watch it because the story didn't impress me .. But I changed my opinion later after watching the trailer and also because I wanna learn Spanish.
After finishing the two seasons, I can say that It's one of the best series that I have seen lately without any doubt. 
I loved the characters especially '' Berlin + El Profesor + Nairobi " but Berlin was very special, It's like watching the Spanish version of Joker.
You guys should watch it, You won't regret. Seriously where to start with this crap of TV Show. It's clearly a hyped show by the channel that produced. <br/><br/>Characters: shallow, hard to identify with any of them especially with any of the main ones
Plot: Too many holes. It's the "pointing gun at others festival".<br/><br/>Save yourself few hours of your life One of the best series I have watched since Narcos and GOT. I must say it gets very interesting as you start knowing each character.<br/><br/>I'm sure you would finish all 4 seasons within 10 days you start watching it It was recommended to me by so many of my friends. So I started watching Money Heist! I have always loved suspense thrillers but for me Money has turned out to be the best of all! Thanks to Netflix for blessing with such a world class content.<br/><br/>It's a beautifully written story that will keep you hooked for 4 seasons. You are lucky if you haven't watched this because they have just released part 4 and it was almost an year's wait for it but trust me every minute is worth watching.<br/><br/>I am sure at the end of s4 you will be like "just give us the season 5 already". It's. a perfect blend of ingenious planning, careful detailing, thinking about very minute points(that has impressed me a lot) and ofcourse the depth these characters portray.<br/><br/>The professor is the best chatacter of all and I am sure there are many reasons to it but mainly his calm and composed behaviour.<br/><br/>Berlin is highly missed inside the Bank of the spain! He would have lead yet another perfect yet slightly messy heist.<br/><br/>Nairobi will be terribly missed. I don't know why it happened but it turns out that the Berlin's death resulted into a Chaotic leadership inside the heist and that's why they have just left us to the past memories of the Berlin.<br/><br/>If you watch Money heist in English, I am sure you will fall in love with Berlin's voice!
Contained, beautiful, insightful, a little bit on the masculine side yet elegant.<br/><br/>Spoiler: It starts to get a little messy in S3 but s4 turns depicts almost complete mess in their plan but that's how they connect with real life so well!
It's a like chess game , you might play your moves but opponent has got his own, and it might leave your burned for a while or may be even make you go downhill. I actually liked where things started falling apart naturally because it would be a bad set up if professor knows everything beforehand and the show would be too predictive. Although, It's the Professor, who has made us believe in that.<br/><br/>S4 ends on a perfect cliffhanger and I cannot wait to unfold what's there inside in Season 5.<br/><br/>Till then, Bella Ciao, Bella Ciao! Many scenes are unrealistic, and there are situations that stupidly raise the pressure of the viewer and a lot of coincidences Just amazing!! But I think 8 part is too minor.. you should release 100 part at once.!! Superb...... Professor naild it again. I love all the cast of these show. This serie breaks the norms, and make humour about this at the same time. Like a person tha has self-sarcasm, something that shows logical and emotional intelligence. Very good actors, suspense, nice plot - not always realistic, but carries a strong message. And of course, love...
10/10 for me. When we will be able to watch all episodes of season 3? I like it ifi ifi 9gifts ifif ufi gif igivifysugig8g8f8g9g I think this series is overrated. I've seen it all before in "Inside man". It's a great production and has magnificent photography, but the plot line is full of holes and it tells nothing new.
Nevertheless it's a good series to watch before you go to bed, or if you are so damn bored on a sunday afternoon and have nothing better to do (or read, or watch). There's literally not a single actress or actor in this series who doesn't annoy. it hurts, watching the series. it hurts a lot. The logic of the plot is completely beyond me.
there is one guy, the brain, the professor. he seems to be very intelligent, but then he selects a team of "professionals", who is the complete opposite of being professional. I mean, every single episode, you have to deal with at least 30 minutes, watching these guys behave like drunk teenagers on their first date.
this reminds me of mission impossible, or oceans eleven, but the complete opposite.
don't watch it. seriously. it hurts. The hgh rating does not reflect on the actuall quality. This show is average and nothing more.
I agree it's fun and can be seen to kill spare time. But calling this show great just shows you lack experience with good tv shows. Go watch Breaking Bad, Dexter, GoT, The Shield, Lost. Then I want to hear you say La Casa de Papel is even close in terms of quality, acting, plot, intrest.<br/><br/>So many plot holes, so many predictable moments. Don't fall for the hype. This is not a "great" show like some people hail it. Watched 8 episodes yet but took only 8 hours. Couldnt stop watching with all twisted episode ends. Intro video and music amazing. Directing and acting is fine. (Im not used to Spanish show, so.) Story keeps getting you everytime with every new information. Season 1 and 2 were great, solid 9/10, but the last two just destroyed it.
Plotholes everywhere, most of the characters actions don't make sense, stupid new characters, totally unrealistic crap happening all the time, the professor seems to know everything, his pakistani hackers are straight out of a bad hollywood hacker movie, the dialogue makes you go mad because its so stupid and there are way too many throwbacks.
Also, the whole thing is way too long and just gets boring, this could easily be a 3 hours long movie.<br/><br/>Another thing that's just ridiculously stupid is Julia or Juanito, the new undercover hostage. First of all, who needed a trans person in this series? it doesn't even contribute to the plot, Netflix just put her in because of money and good reputation. Then secondly, the "trans person" Julia isn't even played by a real trans woman. ridiculous!<br/><br/>Take my advice and watch Seasons 1 and 2, leave the rest out. I don't know where to start. Really. I guess it's supposed to be a mix between crime and comedy which doesn't work at all, 'cause this series tries to be a bit of everything. At times it even tries to go deeper into the relationships between the hijackers, but it's all very clichÃ©. The characters are very one-dimensional. And the story just drags on and on without something happening. This show is just about creating non-sense, irrational and dumb sequences for desparately bringing up nail biting situations. Exaggerating so called emotions and feelings of the characters, the story fails to land in all of the episodes. A Topsy-Turvy tale which is too slow to digest and unnecessarily hyped. I tuned into this hoping for a decent and clever bank heist tale. In some parts I got this.<br/><br/>It feels like they first of all gave the script to some intelligent writers who conceived of these brilliant schemes to get into the bank, deal with the police and plan their escape. The kinds of antics that make the audience think 'wow, these guys are pretty smart'. The stakes are big, the planning is meticulous and the huge rewards worthy of the effort.<br/><br/>When that was done, they then gave the script to a bunch of horny, adolescent teenagers who must have previously written 80's Australian soap operas. It is terrible. From establishing the actual job, it descends into a series of foolish characters who literally cannot keep their hands off each other and cannot keep their head in the game. They're shagging in vaults and toilets and offices. They're shagging when they are casing the joint, when they are doing the job and even with the lead investigator.<br/><br/>From a job offering untold riches and the commitment of 5 weeks and the time for the heist, nobody can stay focused on what they are doing. They utter these silly speeches about how committed they are to the job and will kill anyone stopping it from happening but then in the next scene are willing to sacrifice it all for their sexual urges or the chance to be nice to hostages.<br/><br/>So at the beginning, you are on the side of the criminals because their plan is so audacious but as it progresses you become more disinterested in their overly dramatic histrionics and complete lack of professionalism. There was one laughable scene where they were having another internal dispute and literally no one was supervising the hostages.<br/><br/>Now, I'm sure people will say that you need to develop characters and yes you do but when those characters are acting so immaturely, so petulantly and so lacking in thought or consideration of the bigger picture, you just kinda get bored with them. You start looking for the most stupid and heist wrecking thing that they could do and laughing when they do it. I didn't tune in for a romantic drama but a bank heist and when the characters are behaving like silly teenagers, the tethers to your interest just withers away.<br/><br/>You just want someone to shake these people and say 'we're talking about millions of Euro's each here. Is it possible you could remain on target for literally just the time of the heist (2/3 days) and then play out your love chasing routines when the job is done?' But even the guy at the very top is distracted by skirt so they all descend into silly unengaging children playing robbers.<br/><br/>So overall, it was a fascinating concept that was ruined, and I do mean ruined, by characters acting so idiotically that they become laughable and unlikeable. They go from the no nonsense crew in Heat to a bunch of sexed up moronic clowns. Whats season 1 and 2 and then stop. Season 3 and 4 are an insult to your intelligence, consider yourselves warned and dont waste your time. Seasons 1&2 were great, season 3 struggled but a fantastic finale, season four is getting a little far fetched, looks like it's running out of steam I love this show from start to finish. My favourite character in the show where Nairobi,The Professor,Tokio and Helsinki. What I loved about this show is that I just love every character personal story and the friendship they had I know they had a few argument and disagreement but they where like one big family that love each other and I love the romantic relationship between Tokio and Rio. The happiest part about the show when they got away from the Royal Mint and having around 2.4 billion euro to split for ever person who was involved with the heist even know the whole dam police world where looking for them. The saddest part of the show was when they captured Rio and tortured him and beat the hell out of him just to get all the answer out of him in relation of the heist. Another sad part of the show when Nairobi got shot in the head with the gun. I was very sad when she got shot I had an tear in my eye when that happen I want the person who shot Nairobi to get shot and got to hell to what he did to Nairobi but why he was kept alive for the professor plan for operation Paris. Thank you for taking the time to my review of the Money Heist here a quote and to finish it off BELLA CIAO BELLA CIAO BELLA CIAO ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ It's like Ekta Kapoor's Ocean's Eleven. Go watch something better if you're even planning on watching this dumb show. In the previous parts we can see the heist is totally based on strategies and love. In the fourth part, we can see it's full of emotion with wonderful strategies of the professor and the friendship and bonding between the characters. Now this is not at all a series, This is emotion. Will wait for the fifth part of 'La Casa De Papel' or 'Money Heist'. Woow!! Amazing movie
I love all the detial of the story,
Berlin, he is such an brilliant, charismatic, and intelligent
I can't sleep waiting next season It was good season they changed the pace of it characters got more aggresive towards hostages and hostages have almost no effect on the heist and we cant connect with them like season 1 n 2 and its not as hype and suprising as season 1 n 2 and character building is a bit weak on this season but overall its much better than season 3 and its not that bad to have a aggresive season No words to say...Highly recommended and superb.Climax at it's very best I luv it. Waat a screen play and BGM.Each and every screen will make yu sit in the edge of the seat. La Casa De Papel or Money Heist was a series which took a couple of episodes initially to grab my interest. Having said that, seasons 1 and 2 (barring a few convenient plot lines) were supremely brilliant. The professor's detailed planning, the execution (along with the things that failed) made it a very interesting show that made viewers aware of the fact that anything is possible in this series & that you're in for a roller coaster ride. It also tied things up neatly (and conveniently, might I add) to give the fans a bittersweet yet strangely satisfactory end to their first 'heist'<br/><br/>Alas, with Netflix taking over & with the greed of milking the cash cow, they sort of started ruining the series in seasons 3 and 4. The new characters aren't that interesting (yes Palermo, I'm talking about you), the overuse of Berlin's past to act as a filler in between and also the strange chemistry that the team is now sharing seems very incoherent to what we saw & became used to in the first two seasons. Seasons 3 and 4 aren't terribly bad. They're watchable & they also have their genius moments. It's just that it's too little & something that demands a lot of energy from you to sit through the painfully dramatic scenes (especially in season 4).<br/><br/>Even though I'm looking forward to season 5, that's only because I'm way too tied up with the characters now thanks to the first two seasons & also since they left things hanging at the end of season 4. I made an account for put my rate in this movie. I love how they make season one two, three, and four but honestly, season 4 is not as good as 3 seasons before. Overall, I love this series, much. You make us listen "bella ciao" from over the world :). Thank you for all the cast, crew, and everyone behind this series. Thanks to Netflix ofc.<br/><br/>#lovefrom Indonesia Poor writing, leaving many plot lines unsolved and a painfully unintelligible protagonist leaves viewers wanting more. Just finished watching season 2. Yes, it may be a little late compared to many of you.<br/><br/>I have only one word to say "Wow, what is this"? It's that good and full of thrills. Every character is so powerful, but Professor has taken this series to the next level. Hats off!<br/><br/>It's a Must Watch! The idea of the series is good, but the crew is made of amateurs.
They have no guts and they are not even able to shoot someone. No suspense as you know no one dies. Its rubbish and I am really annoyed my teenager made me watch this. It is such a weakly crafted TV show. Poorest acting in the history of cinema.Can't understand this success The storyline is so interesting and dynamic, throughout the whole series. It kept me hooked from beginning to the end, so I binged the whole thing in few days. It's perfectly balanced between keeping It interesting and yet not exaggerating with plot twists, so it still feels natural and realistic, opposed to forced which these days often happens in some shows just in order to prolong the season. All the actors did a great job portraying their characters. You can't help but feel somehow connected to each of them in a different way.<br/><br/>Sadly I have to say that in my opinion seasons 1 & 2 are a lot better comparing to seasons 3 & 4. Season 3 is still fine but season 4 has some parts which started getting really boring at some point. The logic explained and thrilling moments of the heist keeps you at the edge of your seat. Bank scene absolutely show cling how they treated people what was the writer and director thinking to make people so scared instead of just robbing the bank. Is this the best heist story ever made?
Maybe not. But La Casa de Papel is pure exhilaration and thrill. The cast, led by the suave yet reticent Alvaro Morte as The Professor, do a terrific job of holding the narrative together while showing their respective idiosyncrasies. The bright red jump suits and the Dali masks they wear are a loud voice of resistance against capitalism. There's enough twists and turns and manipulations and plans to keep you glued as you jump episodes. BUT, the screenplay could have been much much tighter; the series wastes a lot of time meandering from past to present, sometimes testing patience. Even some conversations between hostages and the goings on inside the fortress feel like a drag. I'd give a million dollars (sorry euros) to kill Arturo!
All in all Money Heist is oodles of fun on TV. Its entertainment of the highest form, and it keeps you guessing till the very end (although part 4 was the weakest of all). The motive behind executing Heist#2 also isn't satisfactory ie. risking the lives of 8 members to save 1 (you'd agree on this point after watching part 4)
Give it a watch, its definitely worth the time most of the time.<br/><br/>Bella, (Boom Boom) Ciao! Brilliant, Masterpiece
Fast, on the edge thrill & game of twists after twist, season 4 aced all the others.
History in the making. People going to talk about for it many years. Haven't seen such series after Breaking Bad.<br/><br/>Salute to all the series makers for masterfully heisting our precious time The season 4 really changes the entire dynamics of the plot! There are so many surprises and the way things turn out till the end is delightful to watch. Waiting eagerly for Season 5!!! Bella Ciao! The best show specially I liked the reckless smiling and stable of Berlin. This is the show you can't miss to see. Every second of this show is worth watching. This can be your best addiction. You won't regret watching it ever. Waiting for the next episode/season! Completed the 4th season too. This is my 2nd series which I've given 10 stars after "Stranger Things". You won't regret watching I promise. LaCasa da Papel/Money Heist is one of the best shows out there. It's engaging from the minute you set in the first episode. The pacing of the show is just perfect. You won't feel even an episode wasted. All episodes are high on suspense always keeping you on the edge and will keep you hooked and longing for more.
Having a brilliant story and plot the main highlight of the show is it's characters. You'll have give it to the writers for writing such amazingingly flawed characters. The characters are layered and have amazing growth and arcs. You get so invested in the characters that you start feeling their laughs and their pain and you start rooting for them. You might even cry when one of them dies. And trust me the stakes are very high, they will die, even your favourite ones can.
The show has a unique way of story telling by parallelly showing current and flashback scenes which makes it even more engaging and makes the characters and their actions relatable. There are valid explanation behind all the big smart actions or plans which sometimes are little hard to buy but still serves the purpose.
The episodes are full of suspense and thrill and are high on emotions as well.
The show is extremely high on symbolism as well. How the Dali Mask, Red Colour and Resistance and of course bella ciao is used is extremely remarkable. It adds up even more layers to the story.
The cast is spot on and acting is decent.<br/><br/>Overall its a must watch.
Totally binge-worthy. Dull as dishwater .Crap acting and just not suspenseful ,whatsoever Inane plot line, robbers falling in love with hostages and I was fuming when watching the last episode of season one that mint robbery would not end.<br/><br/>Who makes a show about a robbery that lasts three seasons? This is soap opera.<br/><br/>I can't believe I wasted 13 hours watching the first season. I liked it alright. But if you can't wrap up a robbery in one season don't make a series.<br/><br/>My recommendation, save your time and don't watch this endless PAP. Nice premise, beautifully filmed.<br/><br/>Season one is nice, after that it gets completely brainless. Telenovela style plot.
Except telenovelas don't take themselves serious which makes it fun.<br/><br/>This is just completely unrealistic. The supposed strong female inspector is a character written by a sexist.<br/><br/>90% of the scenes are some character whining about something, they all get their fancy emotional monologue. Boring. Again and again.<br/><br/>The bankrobbers are the most incompetent, irrational, emotion driven bunch I've ever seen.
The professor is supposedly super smart, but actually reminds me of one of those people who are convinced themselves they are smart, but everybody else knows they're not.<br/><br/>At some point I wanted to punch basically every character in the face when they were stupid or emotional again. Completely unlikeable characters.<br/><br/>Good for some brainless binging, but keep your finger near the ffwd button or play some games or smth.<br/><br/>I feel really bad for the script writers. I don't know what happened there, but if I was responsible for this I'd quit my job and start brewing cider... With nice artistic choices, a smart storie and charismatic characters, La Casa de Papel os one of the best things you will find in series! However, the show still have problems, especially in the second season and the end of first season: plot holes and conveniences, besides drama bad posicioneded make the show less then it could be; however this doesn't mean a terribly thing, just are mistakes that most public will barely notice. In the end this serie still one of the best and you really should watch this now! Best TV serial so far I have seen game of thrones and many more it's gonna be legendary ! ðŸ˜ƒ Probably the only thing better than breaking bad, highly recommend watching Awesome direction awesome show. Not a single second is boring this deserves 10/10 This is the best series i have watched on Netflix so far. all the drama, acting dialogues are written so well. just disappointed with on script where they habe to hire Pakistani hackers. seriously ??? Pakistan is not that good. there GDP is so poor. it could be any asian country like china japan korea etc. but why they have to take Pakistan name? so made at this. Started watching this last week and now I cannot stop! Full of drama, great story line and it's always intense before an episode end I love it omen of the best shows right now on Netflix !<br/><br/>And give that man pedro alonso WHO plays Berlin a Emmy damm hes good A lot of people say you must be braindead to like this series but i think you must be braindead not to feel anything watching this series. No, it's not perfect, has minor plot flaws, yes, some characters are acting idiotic sometimes but overall it's enjoyable. Anyways, watch it and make up your own mind, just don't listen to all the haters pretending to be professional critics whom i believe couldn't even write a two page essay. I actually thought about not seeing this at all. Thought it would be a mediocre show. But this is honestly the best I've seen since breaking bad. The characters are just so good! You gotta love the music and the well timed epic moments. Game of thrones, sorry you are now descending on my top 10 best series ever. This show never really get boring. Sure it has its slowdowns but they are short and once the pace is at its normal high rate it's probably one of the best shows ever. Enjoyed the first 2 seasons. Rated it 8. This 3rd should never have been made. Mistakes can be made, even by Netflix. Financially though I think they win big time. This is how all the tv shows , no matter the plot , should look like ! Poor acting 
Plot has plenty of weak points and nothing original
If you watched inside man, one movie is 10 times more authentic and thrilling than this weak show. 
Unless you never watched any great American show in the last 10 Years then go ahead and enjoy it Given the very high review ratings I expect much better. Most of all this series was, (for me), a dramatic failure.<br/><br/>Clearly the writer expect that the audience for 'Money Heist', (English title), would sympathize with the criminals perpetrating the heist; however for me he completely failed. At no time during the series did I have any positive feelings for the perps, and why should I? They managed to hold numerous hostages for over five days with threats and intimidation; one hostage was de facto raped; they injured two hostages and several police officers; they got three of their own number killed (though the writer presumed to shift plain to the police).<br/><br/>Perhaps it would be a different to a Spanish audience, but for me the writer's premise, that the theft of cash that the very clever criminals printed themselves at the Spanish Mint would involve anti-establishment and anti-police/authority sentiments among viewers, totally failed.<br/><br/>There were other weakness beside the above dramatic failure. Perhaps these were more relevant in the English language version than the native Spanish. However to me the characters tended to be implausible, especially the mastermind, "The Professor". Likewise various various events were implausible in context. Most of all among secondary faults, the English voice actors in were poor choice and their director was terrible. It's different and it's revolutionary. Bella Ciao!! This tv show is intense, brilliant, well written. Must watch! Money heist is a must see, once you start you're hooked. This can't be missed. So when the latest season got released it created so much hype ... i ended up watching entire seasons....first 2 seasons were masterpiece ... i am speechless .. It was well scripted and throughout the episodes maintaining thrill.
But when it comes to further seasons i was not interested in watching anymore because what new things they can do?? To plan a heist again with same plot???
it took me 2 weeks time to encourage myself to watch more i dont wanted to leave in between.<br/><br/>
i have watched entire last seasons by skipping and still i know the entire plot and story...i mean they were just dragging the things.......And i liked Raquel not lisbon
And end of the series i was speechless again but in bad way... It was masterpiece till 2 seasons...
Now i only want to know how will they get out of the bank in next season...and i hope it will be last season maintain its level... until writers dont plan with completely new concept...<br/><br/>....
.... I actually like this show, but lately, it became overhype. It should've ended in season 2. Coz season 3 and 4 doesn't make sense anymore. I mean, there's no point of robbing The Bank of Spain whilst being rich isn't the main purpose of the heist. 2 Seasons to complete 1 Heist, actually not required. Unwanted conversations in lot many situations which could have cut short many Hours. Much appreciated fact is the Creator thinking. its beyond imagination and crazy with less of Reality. S4 is the best among all. Becomes more interesting once Gandia escapes.
Watchable. I would love to give it higher rating but the 4th. Part talked too much talk bout sex and homosexuality which i think diluted the ideas and made like promotional materials not A suspense and crime drama!!
I think they should lower the level of homosexuality to normal or none at all let viewers enjoy the narrative instead. The show starts as a really well written, well thought out heist. The heist may not be totally believable but the storyline was good. Season three and four are terrible, season four in particular is absolute utter garbage. You would think with Netflix money they would be able to do the show better justice but the storyline is moronic, nothing they do makes any sense. The constant deviation from common sense annoyed me more than anything. By the end of season four I was angry that some idiots let this show get produced. They should have ended the show after two seasons. The original idea is OK, however, it looks more of a bad soap oepra for teenagers. I found it quite irrealistic... This is 100% the best Netflixseries i've watched so far! The actors are amazing and the storyline is insane. It also made me cry several times and I just CAN'T wait for part 5 :) The best series of all times. The characters, the plot, the cinematography , everything is amazing. Season #1 is promising but there were too many plot holes . The story concentrates on good the heisters are instead of the cops.. Should have gave some weight age to the police dept. Suspenseful, funny, and action packed. "Money Heist" (La Casa De Papel) is a feast for the eyes and the senses. The cast is so well put together and the storyline keeps you on the edge of your seat. If you are a Hollywood super-hero movie fan, then you will not like this, the story line reflects a real life situations, ok some of the characters are dumb and behave erratically, but that also happens in the real world.
For the people who rate this show poorly all i can say is, go watch spider-man or other movies alike.
Can't wait for season 5. Favorite series after game of thrones.all the character of money heist is very good and one of the best characters in money heist are professor and tokyo.i think all the people should watch this series Loved the story, loved the acting.
Really enjoyed watching this series.
But I am disappointed they add all these personal political issues they added in.
Not impressed about that It is clearly inspired on the 2006 film titled "Inside Man", the storybook is very similar but the Spanish TV show extends it along four seasons! Amazing season 1 2 3 and so stupid season 4. Writters should have worked much harder. When 6 people shot you with automatic guns you survive, twice !!!, even Hollywood would be ashamed filming such a lame twist. Too unrealistic and immediately fails at the beginning of season 2 I was three episodes in, and I was in. But then, I'm in Part Two, and it's still the same day! This had great reviews, and I was very excited to watch it.
I wish I could like it more, but I can't. I wanted a heist show, and I got a soap opera. They could cut like six episodes, and it would be so much better. I will not be watching the rest of the series. I could have slept through the last three episodes and I would have the same information I had after the third episode. It's slow-moving, and it loses its punch because of it.
I had high hopes, but it does not live up to the hype- at all. No words for this amazing series! This has been the best series I've seen so far. The casting, story line, acting, everything is just perfect like how the way it should be! People who mostly binge watch thriller series, I strongly recommend you to go and watch this and I guarantee you that the suspense created at every end of the episode will not stop you to watch the next episode. It is truly extraordinary how quickly and spectacularly this show has gone downhill. Was absolutely brilliant in the first few seasons but season 4 is a shambles. I can let a few plot holes slide due to the brilliance of 1-3 but season 4 is so ridiculous that you can't look past the idiotic writing. Very disappointed as seasons 1-3 set the bar high and the writers and direction have failed fans miserably in this latest season... I just hope they get back on track for season 5 or my view of the entire show will be tainted, something I don't want to happen after how much I enjoyed the first 3 seasons! After Prison Break, Spartacus, Lost, The Vikings, Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad...
This was so slow, so missing. Even some of the main characters which would always be loved, were so antipathetic.
Below would be a little spoil!!!
If professor would be smart enough, he wouldn't give duty again to Tokyo after her first operation madness
There were too many missing parts and could be easily predictable...
Lost hours for this series!!! I really enjoyed Money Heist to begin with, its very well made, but, in the end it just annoyed me. The plot twists are predictable and you end up feeling like you are only offered one choice, to empathise with the gang and if you don't find that you do you may as well turn off. I gave this show a higher score at the end of S2 & I thought that was it & then they come up with S3 & 4 which are exactly the same as the first 2 seasons but with a little bigger budget & more drama & annoying romance. I'm very disappointed. Other things that I disliked about the show: there were action scenes where they were firing 100s of bullets at each other just a few meters apart & nobody gets shot lol or scenes where they are in extreme danger & they need to get away ASAP but they keep talking or they discuss their romantic problems. I advise anyone to only watch the 1st 2 seasons. Don't waste ur time Now before you read this review, if you haven't watched it yet it, well, this show is just crazy, and you surely need not to trust the negative reviews. Everyone has their own choices and interests and one certain thing very few "logic-finders" can't get is that some thruths don't seem to be logically shaped, or every single drop of the scent doesn't sound to be logical. This is something I would watch over and over and over again.<br/><br/>Now, I don't know where to start from. I am a complete mess (I just finished season 4). Cz it's one of those moments when you are driven by your instincts, emotions, love, affection and whatsoever. Neither there is any idea, how I'm going to sound at the end of this.<br/><br/>"Bella ciao, ciao, ciao!" I can't express my emotion enough for this masterpiece series! It's just... I don't know, I just love it (despite several plot holes and tiny illogical theories). I'll keep adding words to it as I think more and more about it, I just finished 4 seasons in the last three or four days. And this is just.... Crazy, beyond. The mastermind man, the father of the professor, leaves an idea behind, his son brings up enthusiasm to hold onto it. Everything is just so screwed up there and Sergio ,(the Professor) has foreseen every (well not all actually) possible outcome or incident definitely got SOMETHING within. Almost everytime the professor is in distress or starts acting crazy, it's so thrilling, as someone with that kind of mind and calm even gets distressed. Throughout I draw the line every single damn moment when they try to get Tokio (or Tokyo) in distress.<br/><br/>I can guess the heartbreaking end to the tunnel of this craze. In the end, everyone involved in the Heist team dies, even if someone lives, they will lose the reason to live (like the person he/she loves dies or ends up in prison), but I don't want that crappy ending so that they don't seem to be anything positive, cz at the end it's a fiction. In a situation like this, you can, no matter what, I don't want Tokio and the Professor to die. I just couldn't hold to that. Yes it is good fun I stuck with it on and off until the end of series four. I usually get bored with box sets but compared to some of the dross on Netflix, Amazon Prime and Sky mostly made in the USA, this was implausible but entertaining! I watched it with subtitles as I felt something was lost in the post sync good as it was.
It astonishes me the number of terrible reviews on here I would love to see what those people think is good entertainment because unless we are talking documentaries here I found it a great distraction from the CV hysteria. It was on okay watch till season 2. Basically it was all elements in a heist movie or series put together in one series. Hostage and captor falling in love, criminal mastermind, eccentric leader who turns out to be noble and a maverick firebrand character (Tokyo)<br/><br/>Buut..soon enough all logic starts disappearing. Charcaters keep contradicting themselves in every episode. All the past scenes are just put in to build a haphazard storyline, as if each episode is written after the last one ended. Everyone is crazy! Nairobi getting up and walking after a lung surgery, standing straight after her arm is shot! Denver objectifying Tokyo and in the very next episode taking a hands off approach! Palermo being an utter idiot
The most infuriating character is Arturo Roman..just throw him out already! Everyone, everyone is just doing mindless things. Itka like the makers decided to take elements of other successful movies and just make a mashup which makes no sense in totality.<br/><br/>Giant waste of time the last season was.. Too much drama, unbelievable characters constantly making stupid decisions or behaving unbelievably stupidly. Season 4 is a total soap opera. The show is awesome but the English voiceovers at times are not clear so captions are helpful. And the characters make mention of "like in the movies" WAY too many times. It's annoying and distracting. A couple of the actors aren't as good as the main ones and the side stories are sometimes drawn out too long. But overall this is a show I can enjoy but not good enough to binge watch. This is a soap opera with a twist that's all.
Furthermore all the moments when guns are drawn inside of the mint are useless because we know these people aren't killers and nobody's killing each other, especially fellow robbers. If you enjoy bank robberies and the cat and mouse concept with brilliant story writing, this show is for you. I pulled three all-nighters as I couldn't wait to see whose game is ahead more turns (robbers vs cops).<br/><br/>Excellent all around! Made me cry and had my heart beating like crazy!<br/><br/>Can't wait for Season 5!! I was up for 6 or 8 episodes so started to watch. I enjoyed it - then after about 4 I decided to chk the numbers - there were 13!<br/><br/>I decided to persevere and thinking it would all end at 13 I went for it.<br/><br/>Unbelievability - it didn't finish at all and there was S2!<br/><br/>How can anything be dragged out for so long?<br/><br/>I sacked it. Great show but in the English version the voice over is very off key but other than that the show is very good and u get very engaged in to it I like it very much, and I can grasp the rhythm of the last section very well. Love Berlin and Moscow. People are not machines. No matter how well planned they are, they can't escape from feelings. Feelings are the biggest variable here. If you want to find loopholes and imprecise places, you can find as many as you want, but it doesn't matter to me. The whole play has a good grasp of rhythm, a good characterization, and each character's characteristics are in place. The whole play is to attract people and then look down. In fact, he is telling an economic truth in the form of a crime film. As for paper money itself, it's just paper, issued by the government, and finally flowing to the bank. In order to complete this process, people keep working and make everything with their hands in order to get as much paper as possible. After meeting the needs of their lives, people deposit the remaining paper in the bank, waiting for their surplus labor income to be eroded by more paper money printed (commonly known as inflation). Who ever seriously thought about where the more value we created went? Or what? I dropped without reaching the end of Season 2. The series appears to be more and more lengthy with too much unreasonable stuff going on. Every successful television show follows the same pattern. Take Prison Break for example, season 1 is a must watch for every person who watches TV. season 2 is great. 3 is fine. 4 is bad. 5 is not worth watching.
The first season of money heist is a spanish and worldwide master piece in the world of movies and shows. It's the TV show of the decade. Season 2 is really great but not like the first. While it is nearly impossible to find holes in the plot of the 1st season. Holes can be easily noticed in the plot of season 2. I didn't buy the incidents that happened in season 2. The plot wasn't carefully developed. But still season 2 is still amazing, great, and a must watch. Money Heist is still the TV show of the decade with those 2 seasons.
Now you would think that season 3 should be great or good. But since Netflix put their hands on this show and since Netflix ruins everything they touch, the whole plot is overwhelmed with holes, it really suck. The first episode of season 3 is ridiculous. How the story started again is pathetic in terms of creativity. The main characters of the show could have appeared on the first episode on season 3 and said we will start another operation because netflix told us to do so and it wouldn't make a difference. If the 1st season of this show started the same way it did with the 3rd season, it wouldn't even be famous in Spain. And the music is horrible. Too many songs like it is an "American Pie" movie or something. I guess the budget provided by Netflix was spent carelessly. And then, season 4. The joke. I reached the middle of it and then I stopped. I just read the spoilers to know what's gonna happen so that I can follow up when season 5 comes out even though I am fully prepared for an extreme disappointment. Season 4 is when the bad guy(s) turn into the spanish version of robocop or terminator. It is really disgusting. The good guys become one of those hundreds of soldiers that die one by one against Steven Segal, Chuck Norris, Arnold Schwarzenegger, you name it.
So in short season 1 and 2 are like the true horror films. 3 and 4 are the "scary movies" that make fun of the originals. First two season you can hardly digest. Then they come up other season and the introduction of 3 season is pathetic that you will hate yourself for wasting time watching first two season.
If they would have ended tokyos character I would have still seen the the third season. Professor character was perfect until he fell in love jezz come on who the hell does that if you are a master planner. I personally found that this show is brilliantly craved that give much more entertainment to the audiences. Where does all the hype comes from..its a good show...not one of the greatest..and stop comparong it with breaking bad This series shows how perfect heist are done by making the police or whatever authority agree to your terms
Very interesting Money Heist or La Casa De Papel Season 4 has been released on Netflix globally on 3rd April 2020. It is one of the few foreign language Series which got so popular in few time in India.<br/><br/>The 3rd season left everyone in shock and mystery and if you are thinking this season is going to be last and will have all the answers, well I'm sorry but it doesn't. This season is filled with more shocks and twists. Like previous seasons, this season also keeps you thrilled and surprised.<br/><br/>As usual there is suspense in the end of every episode. So you can't delay it, you get addicted. Dialogues are main masterpieces, some of them have a new kind of feeling and inspiring level.<br/><br/>At first it was just a team, but the way everyone gets bonded like family is shown fabulously. At some point it feels like real life, you will forget it's a fictional story, and that's much you are going to love it. Negative characters are also real gems in this story, you keep hating them on every step till the end. Small things like flashbacks, lunches, love stories, songs, celebrations, Denver's laugh makes you happy, feel loved and keeps you emotionally attached to the story. The scene where Helsinki plays Harmonica for Nairobi's funeral is real heart touching.<br/><br/>Character development is amazing in this season. For example at starting you hated Palermo but as you start to know him more and more you are going to love him. Just like when everyone hated Berlin in Season 1, but ended up loving him in the end of Season 2.<br/><br/>Whenever you lose hope and feel like whole plan is failed now and everyone's gonna die or going to jail at that moment the professor touches his spectacle and smiles at that moment a small smile appears on your face too without you knowing. And then you know this guy also have planned for this situation, and just in few minutes professor takes control of whole situation.<br/><br/>It is a must watch series before you die. * CONTAINS SPOILERS *<br/><br/>First of all, I'll start by saying that this is not a bad show at all. Actually, this might be one of the most interesting European shows that I've watched. I had a really good time watching it, in fact, I binge-watched it in around 4 days.
I feel like my duty is not to show how good the show is, but to note what are the flaws that could be improved. Consider this review a future-reference for the successor of Money Heist.<br/><br/>The show follows the story of a gang of robbers (I'm over simplifying), who are lead by The Professor. As soon as you see him for the first time, you understand that his character is different from the others. The name, the behavior, the look - they're all different. Fast forward in the show, we understand that The Professor is not that social, and has no experience with women.
Another fast forward - The Professor falls in love with the Inspector, Raquel. As I see things, the evolution in The Professor's character was not bold when it comes to relationships, and Álvaro Morte's acting was convincing enough in that part. I think the problem lays in the scripts and not the acting. At some point in a show, the character should be as different as possible from it's original state, especially when the evolution takes place in the love playground.
So - I believe that if Sergio's love for Raquel was pushed to the limits, the emotional roller coaster in the show was much stronger (and better).<br/><br/>As I already said, the problem lays in the scripts. The show is FULL of swears, and without thinking about it too much I can say that at least 95% of the swears in the show take the son-of-a-female-dog form. I'm no expert, but from what I know the Latin vocabulary is loaded with much more interesting and joyful swears. We can see the same laziness (sorry to say it that way, but it feels like laziness) in crucial points of the story. The first example that comes to my mind is the "For Nairobi!" scene at the end of the 4th season. That scene is the end of a very important part of the story, and the only thing that all the robbers say one after the other is this phrase.
Different solution? let one character say it with heavy emotion, then cut the scene as you did perfectly (truly, awesome cut) at the end of the episode. There's no need to add Avengers-Endgame vibe to a scene so emotional.<br/><br/>Another thing that bothers me is the low emotional strength of Raquel, and a lot of other characters too. As far as I know, police officers are trained to handle intense emotional stress while being on-duty, therefore they can handle insults and truth being told to their face without losing the poker-face. So, I was disappointed to see the characters (especially the cops) breaking so easily that many times in the show.
Next time - build the character's emotional baggage and let it explode in some point later in the story.<br/><br/>Lastly, a lot of times shows are being criticized by professionals for missing technological details, or even simple things like geographical details. I'll not get into that to much, because making things up is a fine solution in some cases, but some things are unforgivable. Nairobi was shot by a SNIPER rifle near the HEART, and she survived the shot. I'm not a military expert, and I was never shot by anything, but I know for sure that this is physically impossible. The thing that sets me off is that the solution was to switch the sniper rifle with an assault rifle, and that's it, no other costs in production, just add more accuracy and realism to the scene.<br/><br/>After almost butchering the show for the small details, I'll say that the heist plans were magnificent and the overall cinematography was truly attention-drawing. The soundtrack was awesome! Choosing between continuing to the next episode or listening to the episode-concluding song was really difficult.<br/><br/>Rating it 8/10.
Ciao. Series 3 and 4 is basically just a repeat of the first two seasons but not as good. It is still good but it isn't as well done and written as season 1 and 2. The cast for this series is outstanding and series 3 and 4 should have been better than the first 2 but it wasn't sadly because the first 2 seasons where amazing. The show started strong but then quickly turned sour.<br/><br/>Characters now act incredibly stupidly and have dumb 'romances' between each other. Whose idea was it to put multiple romances in a 'heist' series?<br/><br/>And more importantly, whose idea to turn a mini series into a 4 season soap opera with a season 5 in the works?<br/><br/>The show must end, this show has the worst case of seasonal rot I have seen. Only the network behind the show knows what may come next, and how bad it could be.<br/><br/>What started as an intelligent intriguing heist story is now just a soap opera. This show would have been great if:<br/><br/><ul><li>most of the soap opera crap had been left out.</li><li>the cops hadn't been portrayed as such imbeciles. Especially the one called Angel. Dude made me cringe.</li><li>the subtitles weren't so totally out of synch with the dialog.</li><li>the overdubbing hadn't made the characters sound so goofy.</li></ul><br/><br/>And the worst overacting award goes to the guy who played Arturo Roman. I don't think I have ever been more annoyed by a character.<br/><br/>Although the character Alicia Sierra in season 3 is unbearable. Candy munching, blase, and so overconfident she acts bored. I fast forwarded when she annoyed me too much.<br/><br/>But I gave it a six because the action was so audacious and kept me wanting to know what happens next. Expected a Spanish tv-show version of the "Ocean's" trilogy. It turned out to be a soap opera with an interesting idea but extremely annoying execution. I found myself almost shouting at the tv with all the gaping holes in the plot and logic. For example: criminals turn off all phones in the building so that they don't get hacked - one criminal makes a mistake and let's hostage use the phone for 2 minutes - the police hack into it and use the camera to identify criminal. Literally the next episode a few more phones are turned on and waved around criminals faces but nobody seems to.bw afraid of hacking nor do the police detect any phones being on. God dang it!!<br/><br/>Wasted time and nerves... Don't watch unless you're a bored, immature soap opera lover. First two, maybe three episodes were fairly good, like 6-7/10. But 4th and 5th episodes were so boring and full of stupid and illogical decisions that my wife and I found ourselves playing with our phones during the most part of the latter. When it ended we decided to give up on it and look for something better to watch. We totally don't care what will happen in the series and if they escape or not. 1. Start by thanking Netflix for inadvertently bringing the show back to life. (season 2 actually went down in quality compared to season 1.) 2. A uniform look and a familiar theme song are indeed crucial to becoming a cultural phenomenon, and anti-establishment resistance is a timeless theme, and it can be said that the people who decide on these concepts are very smart. 3. While shooting and writing scripts is full of unknown excitement for the actors, the opposite side of the double-edged sword is that some plots are obviously hasty and time-consuming. Let's shoot again when we are almost finished. 4. It was very touching to watch the whole cast pay so much effort for a little detail, and the actors were all very good actors, who performed their roles so impressively that they wanted to cry during the filming of Alba Flores. Because of peer pressure discussed by all of us in Europe, we decided to look at it. If we chase after it, we will get out of our emotions. We hope that this IP will not be over-exploited and have a good ending. Why this show is so much hyped the rating of this show must be 6 Worst directions worst story line but good acting, not worth watching Plain soap opera and overrated. Was not able to complete first episode. People are having long conversation about there love life in between Heist. Show will progress very little over the episode. Every character in this series is illogical and overrated This show is so much overrated and european people are making so much hype of this show Not sure why there is lot of negative reviews out there for season 3 and 4 but let me tell you this show is one brilliant show. Agree season 3 and 4 are not as great as season 1 and 2 but there is more action and drama. The only thing I missed is the Berlin character in the center stage. Every actor has put their best effort in this show and it makes us fall in love with them. If you have watched Breaking bad then you will like this show for its thrilling roller coaster ride from start to finish. Waiting for season 5. My hopes were low but seeing the first 2 seasons I decided that low is a pretty high bar!
To bad that a lot of kids are watching this garbage making role models.
People, there are a lot of good shows out there. First two seasons were great. I would easily rate them 8/10 or even higher. But season 3 and 4 are completely disappointing. Very slow , full of stupid unrealistic scenes and decisions.
Also season 4 does not offer a closure but ends on a cliff hanger . I read some of the negative reviews and I was a little surprised that someone called it dumb. Anything can be improved but this is a good story, well acted, well directed. Its nice to see Madrid giving Hollywood a little competition. I watched the dubed English version, i wish I knew Spanish, I am sure it would be much better. I highly recommend it. It was fine and then not long after its not. Dumb, emotional, immature characters. It should have ended after the first heist. Following same strategy as others.once become hit need to drag it and making it worse
Professor average actor his wife is a disaster..remove that old lady from this...sentimental drama in between ...arturo,angel,Moscow what kind of actors are these....worse really worse....so many other seiries are better than this ...so fortunate they are to be on top which is not deserved Pathetically weak, she broke every rule. Entertaining except for moments I wanted to scream at her. Maybe that's how Spanish women behave but it sure doesn't play in the US. One of the worst shows I have seen. Terrible acting, irrational plots with no logical progression, cheesy side plot discussions, you name it. Actors start crying for no reason, daddy/mommy issues spring up in the middle of a robbery, they bicker with each other nonstop in useless side plots. Don't waste your time. Very interesting story..loved it..full of action..and the story looks like real cause the way they fight themselves in heist.. sometimes they fail the police won but sometime they won..very good till season 2..season 3 and 4 is awkward weird..but still entertaining <3
And yes this a part of plan Way too many plot holes no room for creativity. Yes it leaves you on the edge of your seat because you don't know what happens next but it's one of those shows that nothing ever goes wrong in the show. Season 2 is the true finale, got canceled in Spain then Netflix bought it and ruined it. It's like soap opera way too many lo e stories for an action series. They fooled me and don't let them fool you too. So many love scenes, gay scenes, a transexual character which made no sense Like everything in this generation, I discovered this TV show through hype. It was going viral, on my Netflix home screen, on twitter, everywhere. So, I decided to give it a try. I feel disappointed I wasted my time on this show. I'm not a fan of fantasy shows like Spiderman, Superman, Batman etc. Honey Heist is a mirror image of super hero movies, difference being the crew here is a bunch of bad guys. I'm not a fan of fantasy shows because of the imbalance, one side is extremely strong, smart, has all the powers available right on time and other side is simply dumb. In this show too, it's the same, the cops are dumb and incompetent. The cops in this show have all the equipment, fancy gears, intelligence power, yet they screw up worse than a third world country cops, not once but multiple times, come on, are the Spanish cops really that bad? Could the makers not make is somewhat believable? The Royal Mint of Spain is under siege and the top cop is going on a dinner date? Having an affair with the main accused? Oh my, that is some level of soap opera right there. And to top it off they dragged what could have been a mini-series to 4 seasons. Learned my lesson, don't jump on the hype wagon, do your research before wasting time on something like this again. Review of season 1 and 2
The professor the mastermind behind this heist just narates from outside to his people inside the bank his plans never fails he has a plan for everything and anything at any given situation which is way too much to handle
The cops are shown dump right throughout the 2 seasons i watched
The heist people just keep on printing money and keep digging the tunnel from the bank to get out the female police inspector finds out about the professor but she also lets her go otherwise the heist content would have been open by now
Overall the web shown is just for entertainment purposes
Otherwise story it has many faults Incredible! Extremely imaginative and original, as well as intelligently crafted and suspenseful. The characters are are also fantastic. Was a little weird that it's dubbed over because it's Spanish but you get use that pretty quickly! Super fun likeable characters with lots of twists and turns. Definitely recommend. After speaking with my family on Friday night, I switched the TV on nearly around 1 am knowing very well that I would not be sleeping until the next morning at 9 and that's exactly what happened. Why? Two words - Money Heist.<br/><br/>Money Heist is a Spanish television series revolving around a heist that is surgically designed by the lead character named 'The Professor' (Álvaro Morte). The professor recruits 8 individuals with unique abilities to help him carry out the heist. Drawing parallel to Tarantino's Reservoir Dog in which the robbers were given color-coded names, the professor gives city-based code names to his team. The professor goes on to train the recruits in every imaginable way possible i.e. from handling a gun to handling a surgical scalpel (in case someone gets shot).<br/><br/>Morte brings a different finesse to his character that is previously unseen in any of the roles he has portrayed. It is a testimony to the brilliant character development done by Álex Pina and Morte's ability to enact it on screen. Morte isn't the only protagonist in this series. The series is narrated from the point of view of Tokyo (Úrsula Corberó) who plays one of the recruits hired by the Professor. Corberó plays an eccentric and fierce character who acts on impulse and often runs into trouble while the heist is on. As the story unfolds, the storylines behind various characters are revealed and by the end, the audience starts to root and empathize with the Professor and his entourage. Since almost all the characters are fresh faces to the audiences in the US, it is marveling to see the chemistry between them.<br/><br/>With complex characters, non-linear storylining, Manel Santisteban's brilliant music, and intelligent cliffhangers spread through the series, 'Money Heist' is the first non-English show that has gone to become the most-watched series on Netflix. So much so that just after airing on Netflix in mid-2017, Netflix acquired the global rights for the show which meant that seasons 3 & 4 were shot exclusively for Netflix. Released during the 'shelter-in-place' period in the COVID-19 times, Money Heist is a highly recommended international drama that is a must-watch.<br/><br/>Another interesting fact about Money Heist is it was one of the many shows that Netflix bought without intending to put any marketing dollar behind it. It was the sheer brilliance of the show that people began talking about it, sharing it with their friends and family and the rest is history.<br/><br/>Watching this international series reminded me of a quote from our beloved director Joon-Hu Bong's speech, "Once you overcome the one-inch tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films." Season 4 ep 6 was my last episode. I won't finish it without Nairobi. Go to hell! Bunch of impulsive & emotional fools on a heist. One time its acceptable. But why planning heist with same members. In the first season, throughout the season I was thinking, Professor could have hired 2 thieves more for the heist who could do his jobs outside of the bank and monitoring chamber. Why he always going out every time and heist is going for toss now and then once he steps out. They form a rule but nobody cares about it. Probably that's what writer and director wanna show. That Professor is not so smart, police can catch him now then if they have a will to do so. All they need is to come out of their monitoring rooms. Within minutes we have seen police uncovering professor's hideout in single episode. But then you wont have so many chapters and successful heist. Enjoy the show. Its one time watchable. Everyone acted superbly in this series. Background scores are fantastic. Lets see when they are able to release chapter 5. La Casa De Papel, Part 4<br/><br/>After a Successful Heist at the Royal Mint of Spain, The Professor and his team try to take on Bank of Spain and this time it's not for Cash, but Gold. This plan, however, is made to extricate Rio, from the police who have taken him prisoner unofficially in a remote undisclosed location.<br/><br/>This season gives us more reasons to believe it's just not about the heist, it's about resistance, Resistance to the Govt and the Police, and very well depicted with the song Bella Ciao, which is not the theme song but it has given a strong identity to the series, the impact of this song is so huge that whenever you may listen to Bella Ciao, you will think of Money Heist.<br/><br/>Money Heist Part 4 Let the Chaos Begin:-
Like the first 3 seasons, this one will also keep you on the edge of your seat, right from when Nairobi was shot in the last episode of Part 3, you are keen to know whether she will live or not, Professor who thinks Lisbon is dead in Part 4 can be seen mourning gut-wrenchingly leading you to think why did they have to kill Lisbon? Until suddenly, the episode starts getting interesting after the professor's conversation with Tokyo when he explains how Lisbon was executed.<br/><br/>In the throes of mourning Lisbon's death, The professor let his guard down and it was interesting to see how he tries to make a daring and dangerous escape from the police. Will he escape, of course, he will...it's no surprise that the Professors brain thrives, especially in dreadful situations.<br/><br/>If you missed Berlin, he is back in a Flashback that is based around his wedding, his plan to steal gold and his love for Palermo.<br/><br/>The 1st Episode of Part4 is named Game Over, not yet obviously as there are 7 more episodes to go.
In this one as Arturo the annoying character comes back he tries to create a rift between Denver and Monica while trying to win the trust of hostages in planning a revolt, but no one wants to listen to him this time. Arturo fails to have an impact on us in this part.<br/><br/>The intensity of the Negotiations between Alicia, the pregnant police appointed negotiator and Lisbon is very gripping, and when you think Lisbon is about to reveal everything, the professor comes up with yet another mastermind twist where he makes contact with his love Lisbon through Colonel Tomayo's assistant, Benito. How the Professor gets policeman Benito to work for him is another interesting episode.<br/><br/>If you thought there were many annoying characters like Arturo or Inspector Alicia, then here comes Gandia, The Chief security officer for the governor of the Bank of Spain, it was interesting to see the way he escapes the captivity and how he turns out to be a single yet a strong threat for the Professor and his team, he does succeed for a bit and ends up killing one of the key members in the professor's team.<br/><br/>So a lot of engrossing situations arise simultaneously, Lisbon is being interrogated at the tent outside Bank of Spain, Inside Gandia is creating havoc while the gold Is being melted and outside the Professor is desperately making a plan to save his team.<br/><br/>The Episodes are so gripping that you wouldn't blink an eye, especially when the Professor plans to save Lisbon while she is being transferred to the court and that is when the Paris plan gets activated. The professor successfully creates a rift between the pregnant negotiator Alicia and her boss Tamayo....but how Alicia gets back to the professor is something you will enjoy watching in the last episode, for once there is someone as smart and crazy to match up to the level of the professor. It ends with Alicia and the Professor standing face to face with a gun on his head. We are eagerly waiting for Part 5 to see what happens next. Will the professor be caught? Or will the team successfully fly the coop with gold?<br/><br/>Interesting Facts :- Nairobi's Name was supposed to be Cameroon, The Professor was supposed to be the narrator, the makers then decided on Moscow because of his subtle and light-hearted tone, but finally settled with Tokyo as the narrator. The location used to shoot the Bank of Spain is a govt complex called New Ministries....The Salvador Dali Masks they used is not the only ones they thought of, they were going to use Don Qui-Jote's image, but settled for Dali masks as they were more striking, infact bollywood actors are so inspired by the professors character that National Award Actor Ayushman khurana posted a video of him wearing glasses and playing bella ciao on his piano and Kartik Aryan also posted a look similar to that of the professor. Money Heist is an EMOTION. Best ever series watched so far of such concept. Marvel fans, saying this would not be an injustice, that Money Heist has been capable of building the characters to the same extent over time. Today, I can feel the characters, the kind of directions that has been given makes this series ever lasting. Special Kudos to the whole team of writers, director producers everyone who believed in Money Heist.<br/><br/>I bet you in coming time if this series goes on n on soon they will build their characters to such an extent that it would be a benchmark in itself.<br/><br/>Kudos to Berlin, aka Pedro Alonso, best character of the series, with perfect attitude, mannerisms, professionalism, brilliant acting and speech with perfect choice of words.<br/><br/>Professor, he is an undefeated legend (GAMA), No words to explain the character that has been played beautifully. Saying anything about professor is not possible. Frankly, I am not capable of writing something about professor in few words, coz words cannot do justice to his character. Above than judgement. Director has done a great job in perfectly selecting the crew and giving the characters what was required.<br/><br/>Nairobi wow, what a dialogue delivery you have .
Denver Moscow Helsinki, apt for the role.
Monica you took my heart when you picked up the gun for your friends<br/><br/>Tamayo, Alicia Sierra, brilliantly played the role, Arturo was absolute pain, very well portrayed as n irritating character. Over all each n every performance, concept, story, thrills, brains, dialogues, beautiful happy moments, all this makes Money Heist, The most trending series in India. This will be remembered forever. Every character is an emotion and is a life.<br/><br/>Only Con of this series is the re-involvement of the character Arturo Roman in the 2nd heist. This entry makes no sense in the entire series. This thing just turned into the most ridiculous thing I have watched in ages...A toddler could have written a better story...I mean hell even Lost made more sense...this just went from semi realistic thriller to superman meets batman and john wick...A monkey with a suit shooting an M4 will hit more than this guys...obviously your now bullet proof wearing cotton cloth...great job in turning this into crap in matters of minutes. Just do your self a favour and don't watch S3-4, it will just ruin the whole thing...couldn't watch it anymore after the scene where people shoot about a million rounds on an uncovered target and he doesn't even get as much as a scratch...maybe nuke him next time? Just hope you dont bring back more seasons of this because this thing is officially ruined... The first two seasons had a proper buildup and was excellent to watch. 10/10 for the first two seasons.
The next two seasons were good but had unnecessary extension of the story which I'm not a big fan of. Looking forward to season 5. Unlike most fans of 'Money Heist' who have watched the show over seasons, I watched all four seasons in a go over the past month. So my anticipation or wait for the upcoming seasons were not as high as others, since I was sure that I shall be watching the next season soon after. So I did not get the time to build up my expectations so high as many other viewers might have over the season breaks. That gives me a, more or less, objective view on the show.<br/><br/>Season 1 and 2 are path-breaking for it set a world we had not seen before in Heist films. Absolutely amazing! So I would directly go to speak about season 3 and 4. Undoubtedly after the brilliance shown in the first 2 seasons, expectations were rife with the new season and what the new Heist had in store. What was, possibly, somewhat underwhelming for many was that the modus operandi of the Heist was more or less similar to the earlier Heist with taking control of an important government building, holding hostages and negotiating with the system. In fact even the production design of Bank of Spain looked pretty much similar to the Royal Mint. The escape from the building is still to happen at the end of season 4, so it would be interesting to know how the team gets out this time and hopefully it should be something more imaginative than the digging underground tunnel route taken earlier.<br/><br/>Another aspect that viewers might have found a little not at par with earlier seasons is the professor's charisma. In the first two seasons, The Professor, for me, has been almost equivalent to God who calculated in advance how could things go wrong at various junctures in a Heist and had a backup plan for almost everything. In season 3 and 4, while The Professor plans to evaluate the Heist to the same level of finesse, his plans malfunction or backfire at several instances, thereby diluting the Demigod status given to him in earlier seasons. Certainly his character has a natural progression from the earlier season and, unlike how he was emotionally disconnected with his team members earlier, this time he carries a strong emotional baggage with his girlfriend also being in the team and his increasing proximity with almost all gang members, which makes him vulnerable.<br/><br/>Money Heist has a lot of technical flaws, loopholes or plot conveniences. But the pacing is so fast and the writing is too tight and full of unexpected twists and turns that despite its flaws, the viewer is still hooked on to the show. Not only does it have strong hook points at end of each episode, the narrative is gripping through the entire course of every episode. The several subplots add interesting layers to the show and the characters are robustly built over the seasons. It is amazing how they brought back one of my favourite characters - Berlin in Season 3 and 4 as well. His integration into the plot and contribution to the heist is very smartly done.<br/><br/>I do miss the Professor's double chemistry with Raquel as being the mastermind of the heist as well as her love-interest, which for me was one of the major highlights of the first 2 seasons. Of the new characters, Alicia as the new negotiating cop is pure evil. And the mad assasin one-man-army Gandia as a bullet gone lose inside the Bank is a character you hate and that is perhaps his victory. Also, the makers very efficiently make us root for a group of all grey characters who are all on the wrong side of the law but you still want them to win. Of the older lot, I personally am bored of Tokyo who has become kind of boring with her character as well as performance.<br/><br/>There are theories that Professor might die in the next season but Money Heist as a show will survive only as long as Professor survives. Till then keep us entertained with the same energy! An unusual group of robbers attempt to carry out the most perfect robbery in Spanish history - stealing 2.4 billion euros from the Royal Mint of Spain.
The movie - web series evolves around the professor and with his "perfect plan" he soon became able to execute the biggest heist in the history of spain along with his 8 partners.
Professor ( Àlvaro Morte ) , an charming , handsome with brain played the main role.
The heist caused to capture 67 hostages inside the royal mint for 5 days continously and during this period they made an staggering 1.0 billion heist by followed professor's plan. I am not sure at all whats all the hype about. It is too dragged and the direction is so boring, too much drama that doesn't even relate. I am so very confused of the ratings that it achieved on IMDB. the episodes should be of less that 30 mins and also not more than 8 in total. I have watched two seasons until now and now I am sure not wasting my time anymore. This is one of best heist series I have ever seen. Be it Story, acting or direction, everything about this series top notch. "The professor" is the character like "Heisenberg" (Breakin bad) that knows solution to all the problems, character that you will never forget. For season 1 and 2 i'd like to rate 10/10 but season 3 and 4 was not that much impressive as expected 'd like to rate 7/10 though i liked the acting of professor Aka Alvaro morte and small cameos of Berlin aka Pedro alonso throughout.These characters never get you bored in the show.Overall would like to give 8 stars For me season 1,2 rating - 10/10 but part 3 and 4 was not that much impressive as expected would like rate 6/10 though I liked the acting of professor aka Alvaro morte and small cameos of Berlin aka Pedro Alonso.They never get you bored with their acting through out the series. WELL THE SERIES WAS GOOD TILL SEASON 2.AFTER THAT THE STORY LINE TOOK A TURN AND IT BORING.BUT I LOVED SEASON 2 AND SEASON 2, AFTER A LONG TIME GOT TO SEE SOMETHING NEW Story for last season is really clueless. Expectations was quite high as the previous heist was so exciting! Nice to watch but not logical specially seassons 3 and 4 Palermo,this is a war,act accordingly" are the last words we hear the Professor say during the end of season 3.All money heist fans undoubtedly remember these words.Since 8 months,all the fans are preparing to take part in this war by simply sitting in pyjamas and binge watching season 4.Finally,season 4 has released on Netflix and I have finished watching the entire season.
Season 4 starts off with heaps of tension and drama as Nairobi's condition is critical and the Professor has lost his mind due to the well-planned fake execution of Lisbon on the orders of Sierra.Nothing seems to be going according to the plan.All the robbers are in a worrisome situation as the Professor is not able to come up with a new plan which has never happened before.Meanwhile,Inspector Sierra is on the top of her game and all the moves are hitting the bulls eye.
It is ironic that the series is presented in such a way that we root for the bad guys and curse the people who are trying to catch/kill the robbers.This is what makes the series special.Each and every character has an unique personality and the character arcs are beautifully drawn.The writer successfully writes an almost flawless script for season 4.All the actors manage to pull of an amazing performance.
Money Heist is not just a series,it is an emotion for its fans.Thus,the expectations automatically sky-rocketed for Season 4.I can confidently say that Season 4 lives up to its expectations.It does not have a single boring moment.All said and done Season 4 of Money Heist is a perfect blend of tension,drama,action,emotions,cheap thrills and dark humor.Like the first three seasons,Season 4 is also a masterpiece.Don't miss it.<br/><br/>Ratings-4.5/5<br/><br/>Guys this is my first review so kindly ignore some flaws.Let me know if you found it helpful I've just finished watching series 2 and signed up to IMDB for my first review as I was left feeling so frustrated by La Casa de Papel !
I won't repeat the story line as others have already done this but the story is sound and the acting good for the most part but the massive problem with this is it is sooooo drawn out and overlong.
The first few episodes drag you in then there are overly long, often unnecessary scenes that seem to be just "filler" and by the end of series 1 you question whether or not to continue.
I did and by episodes 3-4 of series 2 considered stopping watching but persevered. By episodes 7-8 I found myself fast forwarding the inevitable long, drawn out scenes to get back to the story line.
The last 2 episodes of series 2 were excellent and what things should have been like all along with a good ending (in my view).
Will I be watching series 3 & 4 ? Not a chance - even if I'd not read the already poor reviews of these my time spent watching this have come to an end.
Bottom line is would I recommend this to a friend and I'm disappointed to have to say no - as I say it could have been sooooo much better but could I recommend someone spent 20 hours of their life watching this ? I'm afraid not.
Such a shame ! A series with an interesting idea for a heist that becomes dumber and dumber the longer it lasts.<br/><br/>The characters could have been better written and many of them are inconsistent. Betrayals and plots are planned only for the plotter to have a last minute change of heart and confess everything just in time to foil any situation that may end the heist. Characters that are moments away from killing each other seem to be perfectly at peace (or in love) a few hours later, as if nothing happened.<br/><br/>The police handling of the situation is shockingly unprofessional on all levels. Following the hostage escape the policemen on site stand passively and watch for a few minutes instead of storming the breach, giving enough time to the robbers to barricade themselves again.<br/><br/>The officer in charge takes time off what should be the most important case of her career to grab drinks and sleep with an unknown man. Not even when there is ample evidence that she might be sabotaging the investigation is she put under arrest. In season 1 and 2 we are lead to believe that she is a tough professional, a woman in a men's world that had to prove her worth time and again, yet she is constantly displaying poor judgement, lack of professional pride and unprofessional conduct. Instead of turning the Professor in as soon as she uncovers him, she decides to interrogate him alone, with predictable results, although she had been warned that the Professor might be proficient at hand to hand combat. The story appears to be pushing her into an absurd they-lived-happily-ever-after love affair with the one person who outsmarted, violated her privacy and humiliated her at her job.<br/><br/>Not that operational security matters for the robbers either: some don't shy away from taking lovers from among the hostages and sharing the plans with them, and the others robbers don't seem to mind that.<br/><br/>In spite of all the shooting there are only a few casualties, and this makes the series feel like some Saturday morning cartoon, where not even the bad guys get hurt. While the robbers may be firing intentionally wide, the police appears to be suffering from Stormtrooper level marksmanship.<br/><br/>The criminal mastermind gets lucky and escapes so many close situations that I actually began rooting for the police to catch him. He is the team leader, yet as the series advances it's obvious that he lacks leadership skills and cannot impose its will on the team. He's got a tearjerking story attached (as most of the robbers have) to divert the viewer from the fact that not only is he's a crook, but he's also greedy and full of vanity as well, given the sheer amount they're stealing.
To be honest, I expect him to be robbed by the Serbs.<br/><br/>Overall, the series is just like a heist - the longer it lasts, the more likely things can go wrong. Looking back, the idea is fine for a movie, but unsuited for a multi-season TV series. From season 3 the story is just implausible, the plan becomes more and more unrealistic with every convolution and the characters make absurdly poor choices.<br/><br/>Just watch something else... I heavily enjoy this show and have binge watched every part so far. I love all the main characters and am throughly engaged in the story line itself. This isn't action series but more of drama, although it does have some moments where things do go down.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint about this show has got to be the excessive amount of flashbacks. I HATE them sometimes I like throughly want to fast forward them but I don't. Most of the time they add virtually zero to actual storyline and they mess with the pacing alot. I would opt to remove them entirely and see strictly them in bank.<br/><br/>I would def recommend this show to everyone into this style of story. I will advise it isn't for everyone as its slow burn and does take bit to get into things in the beginning but if you stick around you'll enjoy the ride. I accept that some portions are quite good, thrilling and intriguing but overall it is full of melodrama which will challenge your intellect and logic so hard in some scenes that we will feel to give up.Some seasons are stretched intentionally which leads it to be boring.It is basically a story about a bunch of emotional fools out for world's largest heist and only god knows everytime how their plan is working.
Professor can see the future everytime and the police professionals are like iving on eating grass.
Personally I feel , If it would be more intense clash between two groups,it will be better
Acting is good but not extraordinary.
Cinematography is average
Screenplay should be mentioned as a strong positive point This show is entertaining. However it's not well polished. Reminds me of a college movie project for a film student. Has a very low budget/cheap feel to it. Actors are mostly terrible D level actors, average script, and below average production. However ultimately it was entertaining. So heres my review- acting F, script C, production D, entertainment B+ After 2 seasons it's a big crap .. like many reviews mentioned how can you stretch a kidnapping scene beyond 2 seasons .. I am done after 2 seasons enough .. Last night I have ever finished one of the best series. This series is full of dramatically courageous emotions and the story has been threaded fully ghoose bumbs and all the series characters have done their role fairly justice.
CH. Professor: He has samartly done his role because of his innocence face expression.
CH. Requilim:she has many beautiful vital roles inspector ,wife , mother ,Robber ,Lover.
CH. Tokyo and Rio
These two character are fully attachment of emotions of love and love only accept win.
CH. Berlin
A superb personality with great voice of concentration for words.
CH. Denvor and Moscow Denvor has beautiful jerking smile and he plays the loving son of Moscow.
CH. Nerobi
She has great height with charming cute face and acts the her character fairly.
CH. Helenksi and palermo
These both character played great role with their exhausting emotional touch.<br/><br/>In this series i have gained many things ,such as buying times and emotional attachment makes many hurdles in the goal of subject.. 1st 2 seasons were intense and things made sense.
Easily binge watch worthy.
Rating for them - 8.5<br/><br/>3rd season was pretty average but wasn't that bad
Rating - 7.5<br/><br/>4th season
(rating - 6.5)
Way too many plot holes people are doing anything
No character development
No feelings for those characters apart from 1 or 2.
Remove gandia and nothing to watch in it.
Rio is the worst actor ever.
This series will go down hill from here.<br/><br/>
Disclaimer - I have watched dimdb top 250 movies and TV series too
Moreover I have watched movies from various other countries in various languages. This is my loong comment so if you don't wanna hear an angry, insulted teenager you can skip.<br/><br/>So I just feel betrayed. I have mixed feelings about this show. I can't get over the fact that I used to glorify this series... until everything got clear with the release of season 3. I mean, i really enjoyed season 1 and 2, they make me feel entertained, but as many critics say, it's just Entertainment. I never took it too seriously bc I just wanted something to watch, I know it's full of mistakes, plot holes and EXHAUSTING love stories that I just can't bear to watch. Still I liked it and recommended it, buy boy how much I regret to even post scenes of the show on FB. Let's move on, right? Well, nope. Don't get me wrong, seasons 1&2 are good (leaving aside those stupid actions made by "intelligent" characters and the stupid sexual content with non sense relationships) if you don't really care (like me) about those details and just want to watch something, otherwise we all know there is a plenty catalogue of good series to watch (believe me, I'll start to think twice before watching a show after watching Money Heist).<br/><br/>Everything went downhill with season 3, now it's just a circus, repetitive, the same stupid characters making the same stupid decisions, more sex, boring plot with even worse plot holes and clichés, forced characters (especially Arturo, it's the worse thing ever, cringy) and again, stupid relationships, but now I think the WORST thing (and this is something personal) was the unnecessary flashbacks. Geez I LOVE Berlin, he is one of the few characters that I liked, indeed my favorite, but guess what? Netflix RUINED HIM. I think those flashbacks would have been enjoyable as a spin off of this character, but they were just "filling" the story. As if the story can't get worse, adding the overdramatic situations and lack of action season 3 ends... with a cliffhanger. At this point I just wanted to watch season 4 just to know what will happen next, like every spectator, and I, hesitantly, waited for season 4. I remark HESITANTLY. I waited 8 months just to know if some errors would be fixed, but guess what? Do you remember when I described season 3 as a circus? It was because somehow It still managed to take some laughters from me, WELL my friends, the only way I can describe season 4 is "the most pretentious, overrated, overhyped, mediocre circus I have gone" BORING in every aspect, those ANNOYING couple problems, sexist comments (well those are since the beginning of the series) again the unnecessary flashbacks (I still can't believe they destroyed Berlin overexploiting him) with low to no contribution to the plot, slow but kinda faster from episode 6, SURREALISTIC moments that made me and my parents cringe (yeah, I feel bad for making my dad watch it, even though he like the series, or that's what I think?) like that moment when Gandia starts to sing with the robbers, like Wtf? One of the worst parts of the season is Nairobi 's death, overdramatized and predictable. How come Gandia didn't get shoot by a single bullet? Adding the forced presence of Arturito, the transexual character who NEVER had a special part even though in season 3 was pointed by the camera several times, zero character development, and ruined characters like Nairobi (how did she went from an "empowered feminist woman" to a woman begging for some sperm and kissing a guy who had only known for some months?) I can't understand how she didn't eve mentioned to Lisbon that HER boyfriend would be the biological father, and instead they had party. The second character ruined, as I said before, is Berlin. I still like him but I can't watch the character the same anymore. They FORCED the character in the flashbacks, I honestly thought those would help to the heist plot but they did NOTHING (referring to season 4 cuz at least in season 3 some of the flashbacks were useful), OMG especially the kiss with Palermo, that's how you end up the reputation of my favorite character, Netflix :), no comments on that. I would mention more but I would eventually become repetitive (hehe). There were some moments when I just took my phone to distract myself. But now, the worst thing by far is how they have unnecessarily stretched the story, like c'mon dude, for real? It is obvious that now the reason is money, more money. I don't think I will be able to watch season 5 without feeling stupid, cuz that's how I feel after sharing memes, quotes and pictures of the characters on FB, I just want it to finish it already. I might delete the posts, but now I won't be able to look someone in the face if they say to me oh! I know you really love Money Heist! This series will be considered my dark past, a past that I won't be able to escape.
Still, I would recommend the first twi seasons, leaving aside all the errors, just if you want to taste the series and feel entertained for a bit.<br/><br/>
Well I think that's it, I feel really bad for myself, I feel betrayed as a "fan" cuz I'm no longer addicted to this series. Such a creative and smart premise but poorly conducted. Thanks for ruining it Netflix, guess I will revisit Breaking Bad to take this thing out of my mind. Maybe I will start to change my preferences, hope so. I thought it is going to be the end of the story but no... Despite of such a long story of a single heist it has so many wow moments when you will literally feel goosebumps. My favorite season has been season 2 for its twist and turn but this one is almost winning the race. Tone of season is slightly hyperbolic where you will find lots of happenings somewhat unrealistic but once your are with it pace you will love those scenes too. So without hesitation go and watch it.
Let's wait for season 5.
Thank you Nice setup of the robbery/idea with a lot of change in the process. But some stuff is a bit too unrealistic for a plan that took years. Me not having any experience at all in robbing a bank see some stuff happen in the show I know would be stupid and mess up the job. You would expect a little better from 'professionals'. Good but not as great as people claim. Series is quite fine if you want to watch an ok show, but don't expect anything magical. It is basically a classic Spanish teen series with respect to the personal relationships between characters. To that add smart ad-hoc tricks, and some "fight against the government"/"we versus them "in the mix and you get a quite entertaining soapy series. It is imperative that in any TV show that when you stretch out the story that it often gets sillier or you try to repeat the formula that made it successful in the first place.<br/><br/>The second heist did just that, it was a more difficult heist with higher stakes and the problems they faced were bit of a stretch on the imagination [e.g. Palermo healing quickly after getting glassed in the face, a nearly invincible head of security, Professor boxing in the middle of a problem, finding the person who tortured Rio and making him confess nonchalantly, and Lisbon's escape plan is just silly (although the fake wall was clever)]<br/><br/>I must say, without the problems they faced and often silly contingencies, the plan so far is amazing, it's almost like a really good Ocean's heist movie. Part 3 did really well in setting up and showing the technicality of the heist.<br/><br/>Part 4 I would roughly say is mostly flashbacks and 2 steps back on the whole series. I would agree with most people who didn't like part 4.<br/><br/>But here's why I still gave it an 8: despite the silliness, the drama, the character development and the payoffs are what keeps you on the edge.<br/><br/>e.g. Palermo's arc is amazing and drew parallels to Berlin's rise/fall/redemption and his relationship development with Helsinki, Sierra's feistiness and problem solving nearly matches the Professor, Denver/Stockholm ups and downs,<br/><br/>and my favorite: they know how to kill off a character properly. first, the head of security promised it and did it in a kind of expected but slow motion build up that makes you nervous. Second, the other characters mourning was given enough time so she doesn't just die and everyone moves on. Nope, they mourn long enough with you. Third, the payoff was great, to use her death as what they called "a missile" and the throwback tribute they gave to her, Moscow, Berlin, and Oslo. I like first 2 seasons but part 3&4 is a complete disaster i couldn't watch the part 4. The real problem is this show quickly became fan favorite and show runners made this piece into fan service. Too many flashbacks (waste of time)<br/><br/>Brilliant show turned into a fan service thanks! All I can say - what a waste of money by Netflix. The only reason why I watched all four seasons is because there is literally nothing else to watch on Netflix. And the only thing I liked about this show is the visuals. Which makes me sad to see all these money wastedon a ridiculously dumb show.<br/><br/>This show is so dumb that it makes it obvious that all positive reviews are fake. Because writing an online review requires at least a spark of human intelligence. And anyone with even a slightest spark of intelligence would be able to see how insanely dumb this show is.<br/><br/>First, all main characters are extremely unlikable. I was literally screaming for them to die any time they had a chance. And on two rare occasions when I started to feel some partial sympathy with a character, he (not she!) inevitably dies as if any signs of intelligence were not allowed on this show.<br/><br/>The plot is completely unrealistic, not in terms of the big idea, which is quite intriguing actually, but in details of execution. I like shows that are believable, and this one would definitely not win any points on intelligence, but I think I made it clear already.<br/><br/>And finally, I found it very disturbing how criminals who's actions were nothing but selfish through all four seasons were portrayed as some sort of revolutionary heroes. They are not even robbing private banks, they are robbing public institutions established to ensure stability of national currency in the interests of general public. How debasing national currency by printing billions of cash banknotes or stealing the entire national gold reserve is in the best interests of the nation? It is just mind boggling, I cannot remember any show with a more ridiculous message than this. First, a couple of general definitions:
<ul><li>A group of 'unique' and 'professional' thieves who always fight and threaten each other, jeopardizing both their robbery-plan and their lives.</li><li>The first chapter is very good, but as the show progresses you realize that thieves are veeery stupid. But, hey, less stupid than those who are behind them (both Police and Intelligence).</li><li>Alonso (Berlín) and De La Serna (Palermo) perform very well, Corberó (Tokio) and Arce (Arturo Román) perform poorly.</li></ul><br/><br/>Second, why is it a 6/10? It has a good mix of suspense and action, that's right... But there are a lot of inconsistencies, things that don't have any sense and plot holes:
<ul><li>At least four times, there is NOBODY keeping an eye on the hostages.</li><li>Some 'unique' and 'professional' thieves don't know how to carry a gun.</li><li>In a similar sto hostage-taking scene, where policemen and thieves face with each other, the policemen is in a very clear advantage. But the policemen never shoot: instead of shooting, they DO NOTHING. Seems like they don't want to catch them.</li><li>Denver's real name: is Ricardo or Daniel? In the firsts seasons, it claims it's Ricardo. But in the later seasons, he says it's Daniel. So?</li><li>Inside the store, Police/Intelligence have a system that allows them to listen to all incoming and outgoing wireless signals. But the mic that carries Ángel Rubio in his glasses is never detected.</li><li>The professor (the most intelligent) leaves stupid loose ends that jeopardize everything.</li><li>Some policemen and some thieves are really bad at shooting.</li><li>Prieto, the Intelligence guy, never closes the bordering streets in the zone near the hangar (where the Professor has always been). Why, instead of doing that, he wants to catch them in the hangar?</li><li>The Police/Intelligence never realize that the Professor wants to divide them.</li><li>In one scene where policemen and thieves are shooting each other, one of the thieves loses his shield and the policemen, again, don't do nothing. Instead of shooting, they wait for another thief to help his partner.</li><li>Wind can move cigarette butts away the soil... But not the ones who have been put by the Professor itself, of course. They had special powers.</li><li>Some thieves can hear far whispers, but they can't hear near voices.</li><li>After the scene where the Professor calls Berlín to hurry up because the police were chasing them, they NEVER hurry up.</li><li>The public opinion is against the thieves, then with them, then against them, then with them...</li><li>The Police/Intelligence never verify nor uses pertinent security protocols (both communication and logistics) with other forces... I mean: neither car plates, nor names, nor photos. Nothing.</li><li>During 'zero hour', when they drop a lot of paper money from an airship, many people are desperate for grabbing them... but, during the thieves' entrance to the Banco de España, there are lots of paper money flying and thrown in the street. Nobody wants them now?</li><li>If Palermo said that he was loyal to the plan, but not loyal to the group of thieves... What's the point on putting him as the leader inside the bank? It has no sense.</li><li>How is it possible that nobody (neither the Governor of the bank nor their guards nor the hostages nor the police outside the bank) recognizes Tokio?</li><li>Tokio is able to become sober in a couple of minutes... And not only that, because just after that, she is able to make a surgery.</li><li>The scene where Palermo kicks the ball in a penalty couldn't be worse.</li><li>The scene where a bull pursuits the Professor and Marsella isn't not credible. In a shot, you can see that both the Professor and Marsella could never jump the fence without being catch by the bull.</li><li>Seems like the grave hole (where Río had been) was made one hour ago, not days.</li><li>The system in the tent delay A LOT in detecting the videocall (between the thieves and the surgeon).</li><li>After the scene where some hostages are released, why is nobody keeping an eye on Arturo Román after his argument with Tamayo?</li><li>It isn't credible that in a bank there is military armament such as all kind of guns, bulletproof vests and grenades... And not only that, there is a secret room with more military armament and a central of communications!</li><li>If the Professor already knew that Gandía was an assassin, why didn't he tell the rest of the group that? Did he forgot this 'little' detail?</li><li>After Gandía got Helsinki hanged, Tokio tries to hold him. Instead of shoot the rope (hence, Helsinki will live), she thinks it's a better idea to hold an enormous and heavy man.</li><li>After Gandía got free of his handcuffs, Río didn't shoot him. He argued he wasn't an assassin... Río must have forgotten that, hours earlier, he and Tokio blew a armored truck with a missile launcher.</li><li>How did the Professor come to know the details of the flight of the plane where Sierra brought Río?</li><li>The Professor orders to paper a lot of walls in the street... why nobody of the Police/Intelligence interrogate any of them?</li><li>Why 'the Río affair' deserves a press conference and 'the State-secrets-release' does not?</li><li>If the police were tricked before (the false escape: sounds, GPS and a ferret), why would they believe what Gandía was saying?</li><li>In Berlín &amp; Tatiana wedding (before the first rob) appears the Professor, Palermo, Bogotá and Marsella... Why Bogotá and Marsella doesn't participate in the first rob but they do in the second one? Palermo's absence is explained, but Bogotá's and Marsella's isn't.</li></ul><br/><br/>Finally, I'm sick of the 'revolutionary' and 'anti-system' ideas served by the same system you are supposed to fight against.
The State isn't the Government: the State is the People. If you rob the State, you are robbing the People. Just as simple as that. Imdb please put a zero in the rating, 4 season is very very bad :( I don't know what to say my hopes where crashed after the showing of the last season i am sorry but it could end in season 4 and it will last as a great legend and maybe my grandsons in the future will watch it but aftr what you did in season 4 I am sure that you will lose a lot of fans if you do the same in the 5th season
At last It was rated 10 by me after the 4th it goes down to 8 This TV show is overrated and the police is a huge glitch. They make police look stupid to show the audience that the other side smart. So much fake hype about this TV show. The series itself is not boring. It's no Breaking Bad, but it comes out making just enough sense. Many plot twists seem forced. Characters have no arc. It still manages to be gripping enough to demand your time. I'm not a heist movie fan at all! But but but, I've to say that I binged watched it for 2 days! It so surprising, exciting, roller coaster ride kinda thing. I'm not a IMDb reviewer, but I had to create an account just to review this particular show.. It's absolutely a masterpiece.
Must watch!!!!!! So far every episode has been great from start to finish. The acting , story, and script are impeccable and almost every Episode has some kind of twist or cliffhanger , forcing you to watch the next episode (or 10). If you're a fan of action or crime films, bank heist movies etc this is possibly one of the best ones you'll watch. Hands down. Even if it is dubbed/ subtitled Very clever and interacting plot. But it should have finished in season 2. The third season is a replay of the same... Honestly, I don't write many reviews or give many tv shows a high rating. This was hands down one of the best experiences and well thought out tv shoes I have watched in a very
Long time. Besides a couple of episodes I was captivated all throughout seasons 1 and 2 the main heist. Loved the acting, loved everything.<br/><br/>I highly recommend you do not watch the English dub version, to get a real grip from the actors performances and tone and amazing scenes of emotion you need to watch this in its original Spanish with English subtitles I loved this heist show, so much so that I'm watching it again with my sister. But I'm watching it again, I think some of the voiceovers have been changed. Weird if they really did. But still would recommend this to anyone. One of the best series I completed 3sessions in 3days this show is perfect Simply put, this is one of the best crafted crime dramas I've ever seen. The characters and plot share equal importance across all three series and the timeline split, (whilst not exactly original), is perfectly crafted to create backstory as the real-time plot unfolds. Special mention also should go to the voice actors ... We watch this in the UK with English overdub and it's done so well that you actually stop noticing it... (And I say this as someone that gets annoyed when Netflix audio slips out of sync by a fraction!) Top class entertainment... We want more! First season & the finale is very crispy wing ,but after completing 2 seasons,you get know how childish jjourney mistakes or as they "loose strings" were there, but only if you know what is logic & you have ability to count your profit at the end as an audience. I seriously don't recommend this to you because however good it seems but it turn out as a waste of time at the end. Better listen "Bela Ciao" on loop I rate this show an 8, not for its quality, but because when I watched it I undeniably enjoyed the action and romance. It reminded me a lot of Breaking Bad/Dexter in the sense that it was an endless mistake/fix mistake/mistake/fix mistake loop where we are hoping the main character, el profesor, doesn't get caught and identified.<br/><br/>Before I list some stuff (because a lot of reviews did a far better job than me of listing flaws and plot holes in depth) I want to mention that this show might've been better if instead of filming it as the robbery happening, then the occaisonal flashbacks, they should've opened with the robbery first episode then spent a season going through how they planned it, then the next the execution of the robbery, then the next the boiling point/being caught or whatever. I think that directing approach would've made it better because the bits-and-pieces we get of flashbacks, yes are well placed throughout, but make us not really relate to the characters as much. I fell that should've been built upon first.<br/><br/>As for the flaws, I have a hard time believing any police force, unless amature, would mess up this much. The whole thing with Angel leaving voivemails that were coincidentally delivered everywhere except where it counts was super fake. The fact the profesor had a chance to fix each of those mistakes is unlikely, like he would have to physically be in so many places at once to do that and it doesn't add up. The main girl, tokyo, had no place in that team. She's super erratic and never used logic once. I don't know what the profesor saw in her that would help them considering he's so smart. The shoot downs between police and thieves didn't make sense. They were always injured everywhere except fatal organs and how the hell did tokyo get in with that bike? It made no sense, like they missed everything on her, not even a tire was grazed by a force of trained ops.<br/><br/>What I like though were the love-triangles, the actors played well (except for some side characters like Ariadne and also Tokyo). Me and my boyfriend have so far enjoyed binging it very much. I haven't enjoyed a show like this in a while (relative to others) but it is far from perfect. I'm also usually someone who doesn't watch American trash movies and brainless tv-shows. This isn't American but it had the essence of the filmography Hollywood does.<br/><br/>I have to be fair and this is what I thought looking from the bad and good sides. This is one of my favourite serie,and I recommend this for everyone. It is bank robbery web series..really i was curious that how can make a web series for a bank robbery but as i was expected it is a linear screenplay eventhough it made me surprise first episode itself they went into bank for robbery... Tokyo especially is a shallow, US-style, very annoying character. The Professor (arguably the main character) is quite brilliant, but his nemesis and lover (the police inspector) is also not convincing, despite the good acting. Entertaining, and a shame that it doesn't put more effort in being Spanish instead of... whatever. Everything on this show is fantastic waiting for the new season ASAP Binged watched season 1 in 1 day and season 2 on 2nd . The story is gripping and the direction is superb . Watched in English but still the dubbing is good . Loved all the characters . Waiting for April now... Must watchable web series. The oersons who love thrilling movies will must watch this web series...... it wont drop your hope Intially I really liked the series and was really glued to the season 1. Really liked the fast pace of the series, which keeps you hooked. Plot and the twist and turn in the story were really amazing. But somehow down the road, the story gets monotonous. The Money Heist is a series on Netflix. The actors are amazing and the cinematography is excellent and the music is very good. The series doesn't have any bad parts or weak points. My conclusion is that it's very good series, and lots of fun.
<ul><li>Adriana</li></ul> Master piece and Gripping after the end of first season Came in not expecting much from a netflix voice over. I was so wrong. This show is right up there if not better than breaking bad, prison break, narcos,...etc. Give it a chance just finish the first episode and I guarantee you'll be hooked Am not here for review
But to share my favt characters
Professor is my favt character
Berlin Second Favt
Nd I hate yes i hate Tokyo
She is ignorant, Annoying, Selfish Girl The best tv show I have ever seen before cuz I felt with thim evry step .. the drama is professional and the action very legend I like it and I hope the will keep like this way What a great ensemble. So many stories and character dynamics going on the writers somehow weave it seamlessly together and find the psychology and planning behind each heist so carefully thought out! Excellent show which I watched in Spanish AND English - such a re-watchable show! More More More!!!! Might seem like a high review but let me explain, season one is amazing I was hooked from the beginning and binge watched it, the characters are phenomenal the plot is amazing but season two and three just arnt as good-they don't measure up. Season three was especially disappointing; like someone else mentioned, actors made stupid silly illogical decisions to allow the show to progress however this cheapens the fabric of the show-definitely recommend to watch non the less. bella ciao bella ciao bella ciao ciao After Prison Break, this is the Best Tv Serie which i have ever seen in my life ! Every minute you will be surprise ... and I found myself in love with Spanish ... ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ This show is just amazing you don't feel time passing watching this so addicting the music and everything is epic I loved it can't wait for part 4 Sorry but we watch those before. Some new ideas please! Excellent series ,Good Netflix flick.i have watched 2 to 3 times some good scenes,Tokyo entering back into heist......so on must watch series. I wish this story line was directed by a Hollywood director and this would have been the ever best Serial of all times.<br/><br/>Such lopsided production with so many mistakes and flaws.<br/><br/>But an amazing story and 1 Liner Don't see other review just buy netflix and watch it every episode has a great ending and it will make u curious what will be the nxt professor thinking is just above everyone thinking just go and watch Oh my god
This series is the best thing on streaming at the moment
I watched three seasons in 3 days
Could not stop
Bring on Season 4 All is incredible here, the story is unique, the production and the quality of the actors that are so incredibly talent. The atmosphere of each episode makes you want to continue watching non stop. This non Hollywood series should be in the top 10 tv shows..Non stop suspense,it will glue you to your seat throughout and wanting more.. I was literally blown up by this serie. In two days, I saw all the episodes of S1 & S2 and I'm getting ready for a S3 marathon.
The development of the characters, the music and atmosphere, the messages.. all these elements have created one of the best series I've ever seen on tv.
I liked the psychological close-ups and back & forths, that allowed me a deeper dive to characters, I liked how the honesty and the ambiguous nature of humans were portrayed on controversial characters, (Berlin=the machist/ethic hero, Arturito= the convencional honest/dishonest want-to-be hero, Helsinki= the loyal-unti-the-end hero, Tokyo= the unpredictable atomic bomb of the gang with her emotional wake up moments, Ariadna= the frightened want-my-life-and-your money lover of Berlin that stood by him until his end as promised, etc)<br/><br/>All the characters, beautifully painted make a unique mosaic, a colourful kaleidoscope, an emotional rollercoaster, where the mainstream perception of good/bad loses its density, and values as: honesty, integrity, loyalty and love are brilliantly enlightened, The show is so thrilling and amazing. Full of drama and suspense with great cast and acting. Always recommended. Slower start but Every character is unique and conveys a message. Must watch list. and top rated series. Finished all three seasons in 3 days and night and Already waiting for the 4th season now.....!!!! Just when Hollywood movie industry fails you with pathetic, depressing movie/series titles. Even when amazing, highly engrossing tv series can be no way bear satisfyingly, this Spanish masterpiece gradually but steadily rises.
The best part of this tv series is that all cast and crew are originally Spanish and every single person does their jobs perfectly well.
You simply enjoy acting, plot, directing, soundtrack, costume, lighting and everything else you expect from a great work of art.
I watched the first two seasons in English dub and it was really professional you nearly miss the fact that it is a non-English tv series. The third season, however, was in Spanish with English subtitles. It was amazing, too.
That was for sure and by far the best non-English tv series I've ever watched. It's a must-watch.
Just hope that after being owned by Netflix won't lose its great features. A great watch! Full of surprises, nail-biting suspenses and great acting by the actors made this series one of the bests that I have ever watched. Don't wait anymore and start watching! One of those few series which strikes the perfect balance of entertaining unexpected twists and turns with a ideological & methodical execution ! Love it Early in the show I was regularly blown away by the cleverness of the robbers. As time went on I was occasionally blown away, but just as often smacking my head at plot holes or unrealistic scenes (which other reviews go into in more depth).<br/><br/>I came to like most of the characters, and thought some of the psychological aspects of the show were a high point.<br/><br/>So... watch it as long as you're willing to set aside your disbelief. Awesome premise, the concept and character roles are incredible. Part 1 kept me on the edge of my seat waiting for the next episode. Part 2 was a waste of time. Characters unravelled making bad decisions and infighting, screen time was wasted on useless talking time, you'd forget the cast was actually trying to get something done. It was entertaining to watch but limit your expectations. This had potential to be a truly excellent series. I really liked this and binge-watched in a weekend. Well directed, well acted, well cast. Great plot; many twists and turns. Really kept me involved. Something I haven't seen before. <br/><br/>But....wow!!! <br/><br/>Are they serious with this sexist, misogynistic dialogue?!? Some of the lines were straight out of a bad 1990's corporate sexual harassment training video. <br/><br/>I didn't bail b/c the lines were few and far between. But they were so shockingly out of place in 2017/2018 that I was constantly taken aback. Really offensive and just...stupid, disheartening, unnecessary, and chauvinistic. <br/><br/>Perhaps it was the English dubbing translations, but no matter the reason the gross sexist lines made otherwise riveting moments laughable and almost unbearable. <br/><br/>I enjoyed it enough to keep with it though. When the misogyny was on display my husband and I just groaned and shook our heads. Wouldn't do that if someone said that IRL but nothing much we could do about this other than write this review to express our shock, dismay, and amazement that this made it to Netflix with these insulting lines. It could have been a great tv show,and it started as one.but as the story progressed the holes in it and the unrealistic and non logical scenes accumulated to "come on!!! That's stupid"...many times. A shame because the acting,directing and plot twists were excellent. This series gives a lot of great messages. First of all, Dali masks are not an ordinary choice. Dali is a genius painter who inherits community life contrary to moral and common traditions. He never accepted the society's obligations and the right to misuse ethical rules. The masks represent this irregularity.
The red overalls represent socialism (communism). The thiefs are socialist comrades and they are fighting.
The royal mint and cops represent capitalism. In capitalism money makes everything. Even morality will make money. When someone attacks the money, these people are declared bad. Here they are attacking money. When it is attacked by money, capitalism is fighting against the aggressors through armed and visual means.
The professor symbolizes the scientific point of view and accounting. In the end, scientific thinking and responsibility come from the top of all kinds of problems. But he succumbs love.
I have not seen such a meaningful socialism in a long time. Moreover, the plot was used by the Salvador Dali tactic. You think you're watching the events, but each time you have a deep meaning and a message.
Berlin is a sort of socialist struggle that is on the verge of resistance to the death scene and that it leads and hand in hand with the woman. The song Ciao Bella also symbolizes socialism.
Great job. It's not just a movie or a script. It is a wonderful work as a philosophy. There is a big slap in the capitalist system. There was nothing new in this series, the idea is old , its like a mix between tow show (Prison break + inside man) I don't understand why people get annoyed if something is unrealistic. All action movies/shows are like that. You actually think someone could execute a robbery as big as that? Just enjoy the story, characters, cinematography and effort put in it. It's not a documentary, it's action series. This series will tell you what an actual series is.
I mean hollywood looks pale after watching this.
the brains behind that voice,
the connection with the people.
WE ARE THE RESISTENCE
.Please b Beware- This show will give u chills.
A must watch for every series lover.
Don"t miss it.
i mean it guys. Just don"t It is really amazing,all episodes are well directed, acting is superb especially Professor. Good investment of your precious time.I recommended we all should see it.
Seriously love it.Eagerly waiting for the next season. Best bank robbery ever seen every details covered
if you are not watching this then die... Not as good as rating.
Only "Barlin" is interesting.
Others are boring.
Prefessor and inspector has no chemistry between them.
Police are too weak.
Everybody is making unthinkable mistakes. Really!!! Looks good but it is not!!! Very bad script!!! If you have watched a lot of TV shows ang have high standaeds don't waste your time with this one. I cannot believe this show has higher rating than Prison Break and other much much better shows. As the robbery scheme in the series began to show a slight resemblance to the bank robbery plan in "Inside Man (2006)", what a lie; I lost my prejudice, I felt like I would be in full frustration, but then I did not have that much trouble.<br/><br/>There is definitely too much detail. There are plenty of brilliantly staged scenes. Before anything else, there is an attempt to rob a different venue, with a different style. And, of course, as with every robbery plan, there's a situation where your home account does not fit the bazaar. Flashbackler has been used in many places. By finding yourself in the past, you can look at events with that eye. To tell you the truth, even some dramatic scenes made in order to complete the period are never squeezed.<br/><br/>One of the most important criterions in the series of bloody me is shudder: When you finish watching a part, does it make you sadly open your next episode? So does he have dragging? Or is it that you are not satisfied with the subject after you finish it, and are you looking for another set or movie just to finish the night? Here is the cinsten that definitely opens you to the next episode.<br/><br/>And finally: Let's say, for the sake of the man they have given, if they are trying to beat this place with 2-3 sentences sitting in front of the computer at home, you know that you are just doing it yourself; "I am not like the others, I am a person with different perspectives, others can not see my views, I am walking in the extreme, I am a marginal person, the best critic I am, I am irritable ..." already... Season 1 deserves a stand alone show, a 9/10 from me. But they've shot a second season which will bring down this show... to bad... so disappointing... Was that gay kissing between Berlin and Palermo in the last episode of season 4 really necessary??? I stopped watching because of that! Love it. Waited for part 4 and watched it in one go The best you can watch today. After breaking bad for me second place in history Wow Wow what can I say about this creativity ... Now we can say that Season 3 is the strongest and most beautiful season in the series Criándome con pelis de Tarantino, James Cameron, Spielberg, viendo las mejores películas de la historia, series impresionantes, y me da alegría que después de haber visto tanto, todavía haya joyas que me sorprendan así, una locura, en el mejor de los sentidos, la serie más inteligente e impredecible que he visto, junto con The OA, excelente, sublime, una obra que fuma un cigarrillo debajo del agua, de lo mejor que he visto en cine/series. 10/10 y me quedo corto! One of the worst Netflix productions, La Casa de Papel is a combination of lame Novelas with Steven Segal action, supported by basic cliffhangers and a remarkably good direction (my only reason for 3 stars) and cinematics (for continental Europe standards). It's a shame that this is praised as good Spanish entertainment, when Spain and Europe has so much better to offer. This is the worst production of special police forces I've ever seen. You have 50 trained officers, some are professional snipers, shooting at one criminal and none can shoot straight meanwhile the criminals throughout the entire production can shoot without shields and take down the SWAT team (sounds like they belong with the Star War's storm troopers). Yeah, that believable. No police protocol...that's another reality. Spanish police must be the dumbest cops on the entire planet. I paintball better than the police shoot. Heisters dumber than police, police dumber than heisters.
All heisters supposedly are desperate for the money while acting as stupid and emotional as they can. The police operation is also annoyingly unrealistic and stupid. On the top of that it's terribly slow.
Don't get me wrong you might love it as all my friends did. Best La Puta Madre.. that's all I can say.. make me wanna give a slap in my face for snoring during Mrs. Martinez's Spanish in my high school year. Professor and Berlin were the best characters in the show but other supporting casts are just terrific.. Spain at its best... Viva Espana.. Waiting for season 5. Worth to watch this fantastic webseries. Netflix keep it up Where should I start From
I dont know why this show is so much Overhyped
A total Crap ,Unrealistic Content
Season 1 is only Fine
but when the show is carried on season 2,3,4 Its a Wasted one and Stretched Like A Rubber band<br/><br/>First of All
1.Police Department is Shown Too dumb which Is Totally Unrealistic<br/><br/>2.All The Characters Forget abt the Heist and Carrying on Medical Opearations ..Why So ?Is this Some kind Of Medical Treatment Series<br/><br/>3.Only Tokyo's ,Professor's and Nairobi's Performance was Good<br/><br/>4.is this Heist some Kind Of a Joke
The Female officer who is appointed for the heist is Making Love During Office Hours rather than Focusing on The Heist ?
what The Hell is This?<br/><br/>5.No Logic Of The Operations...Events going on
At the end I say<br/><br/>U Can Avoid this show<br/><br/>Its is Just overrated
No Logic<br/><br/>Unrealistic Take a mastermind, the ones that could predict every move in every situation, take 12 Chuck Norris and put them on a money heist. This is what Money Hesit is, plus the robbers have cheat codes activated (infinite money and infinite ammo), and put them against the dumbest police force a kid can imagine. A total waste of time and a great offense to human intellect.
If you have sympathy for thieves and robbers in genre you could enjoy this series, but if you have a decent brain, try to avoid like hell this series I have recently watched all the episodes in a go. Honestly I would say that this show is so good that keeps you crave for more. A full rollercoaster ride With full of twists and turns. First 2 seasons were like the bestest. Honestly because of 'Berlin'. All the cast is so good that you fall in love with them. 3rd season is also good And it slows down a bit in 4th season. But the thrill in the show covers up all things. So one of best show I have seen recently. Please watch it if you haven't yet. For me it's 10/10 The police is not doi Anything just sits there in a camp and the shooting was like there's a game going on not a best scene where you felt good . This series gives a lot of big messages. First of all, Dali masks are not an ordinary choice. Dali is a genius painter who inherited life that is contrary to popular morality and common customs. He has never accepted the imperatives from the society and the right to wrong moral codes. The masks represent this irregularity.<br/><br/>Red overalls represent socialism. The wearers are socialist comrades and fighting. Mint and cops represent capitalism. In capitalism money sets everything. Even morals will set money. So when someone attacks the money, those people are declared bad. When attacked by money, capitalism is waging a war against the attackers with its armed and visual mechanisms.<br/><br/>The professor is symbolizing the scientific perspective and accounting. After all, scientific thinking and accountability overcome all kinds of problems. But love succumbs.<br/><br/>I have not seen such meaningful socialism for a long time. Moreover, Salvador Dali's tactic was used in the series. You think you are watching the events, but every time you have a deep meaning and message. Ciao Bella is the symbol of socialism.<br/><br/>Fabulous work. It's not just a movie or a script. It is a wonderful work as a philosophy. There is a great slap in the capitalist system. 10/10 You won't regret seeing it. Your learn a lot from it. I dont know why when a sereies see people positive reaction writers of that series try to act them like stupids. what is this rude manner? a bank guardian turn to superman or what? 4 armed man couldnt even make a hit to him? is he bullet proof or what?? you were brilliant but now, nothing. you are fool not us. make fool of yourself.
try to respect people. add fantasy and science fiction to headline of your series Netflix ruined it, it became stupid and stupid, season 1 and 2 were masterpiece, season 3 was fair, season 4 is garbage, it contains a lot of filler, I don't know why Berlin is still there, they could make this season with only one episode One of the best robbery i ever seen in my life.... Every character is fantastic.. Actually this is my first rivew. And I'm man of few words, but I will say that this series is one of the best thing I have ever seen. I have seen so many series and I have habbit of judging them. But this series is so good that I want to watch it again and again and again..... So I prefer to watch it because you are gonna love it. I really like this series!!!
Every thing is perfect and breathtaking!
Im looking forward for the next season. Loved the show. Extremely entertaining and keeping you glued to the screen. Great plot twists, the whole robbery plan is just gonna mess up your mind!<br/><br/>There are times when you end up shaking your head as they have went too far with the story and it's borderline stupid. They could have easily skip couple of scenes in the first two seasons as well and get to the end quicker. But that's only minor flaws in a really amazing show.<br/><br/>PS. Once you hear Bella Ciao you won't be able to get it out of your head! The Series that make you thrilled, if you watch the first episode then you stop at the end. After watching all three seasons continue in just 3 days
I can't stop my self to write this review.
This is the wonderful show, better I will say mastermind show, must watch it.
Eagerly waiting for season 4.
Love this series. Excellent cat and mouse between the thieves and the police. This was an absolute treat to watch, I loved every second of it, The creativity and execution is second to none...I mean to actually come up with a script like this, absolutely amazes me.<br/><br/>I'm very excited for the 4th season and would like Money Heist to continue in the same vein and that too without having to compromise the adrenaline rush we receive watching the show. This is an epic series. Ever. From drama and all the genres. Now I want to travel to Lisbon and Nairobi! Moscow and Denver! Tokyo and Rio! Helsinki! Berlin! Philippines is the the best though. 😊 Great plan great heist brilliant actors . Looking for the 4th part professor my guardian angel best character! Bella ciao Forget the plot holes and the lack of logic for some of the story... this show show really sucks you in. The sets are so rich and full of character, filmed so beautifully. The music expertly interwoven... a blend between classical, folk and modern.... above all, the characters and acting is just stunning.<br/><br/>Alvaro Morte would win an Emmy if he was in the US. His amazing delivery, his pauses, the way he is able to portray his thoughts and feelings through his eyes is just incredible. He even found a way to fix his glasses on his face in an interesting way. Equally awesome is Pedro Alonso and the scene between him and Alvaro singing Vela Ciao will make you wish you were their brother!
This show is just awesome. A masterpiece you just can't get enough the acting directing , cinematography everything is outstanding i highly recommended . I needed a great show like this. Great characters and sucsessfull script. And i have to say that: Tokio is number one for me! Excellent, fantastic, fantabulous<br/><br/>Best TV series on earth.
Excellent performance be each and every character
Berlin and Rio love u for u performance and the marvelous genius "Professor"<br/><br/>Eagerly waiting for Season 4 It's gone be a part 4?Because the final is not clear,and we LOVE to find what happened! I hope that YOU are working on part 4,5 and 6 because is the most beautiful series that i've ever seen! This series has everything it takes to be a treu masterpiece. From characters to action, everything is a at the superlative level. Yes - as in almost every story of this sort there are some plot elements that stretch credulity, but it's an entertaining ride.<br/><br/>Production values are excellent, the writing is sharp & the acting first rate. Unlike in movies of this genre there is enough time to create relatively rounded characters. Yes, there are some cliched elements, but that is the norm in a highly stylized movie like this - it's not supposed to be "realistic". It's certainly unpredictable & original - doesn't really follow expectations & sort of shifts tone a bit as it progresses. It's an odd mix of "Leon, The Professional", "Ocean's Eleven" "Inside Man". (I will say, the Spanish police - trained swat teams, no less - appear to be terribly incompetent marksman! )<br/><br/>Seasons 3 & 4 still entertaining, althoughNetflix is definitely stretching things out for the purposes of ... "papel". Interesting to see so many negative reviews. People are criticizing it for being "unrealistic". Really? How realistic are the Mission Impossible or James Bond movies? How believable are the plots? For that matter, how realistic is "Breaking Bad", or "Ozark" or "Peaky Blinders"? How believable are the plots?<br/><br/>Overall, "Casa Del Papel" is a stylish, & fun heist series with a mix of drama, action, humour & pathos & works pretty well taken as it was intended. This series contains a heist plan that is so unique and a professor who is deadly intelligent with a group of eight robbers having different type of characters. For those who say that the show has so many plot holes and the characters do stupid things, I suggest them to create and shot a series in which everything is so logical and characters have an IQ of 140. Such a series will never be REALISTIC because the life itself contains so many unrealistic things we know. Never mind these negative comments and watch this fantastic show because it is simply magnificient. The show started with promise and the concept was good. The first few episodes were not bad but by the second season it was seriously dragging and I couldn't wait for it to end. I felt like I was invested given that I watched the first series to go to the end but the end actually makes the whole series look much worse<br/><br/>1) The professors only mistake was falling in love. What? He made so many mistakes. Why did he start talking to Angel and let him into his factory? Why do he appoint a bunch of morons to do the heist? Why do he only use the Serbs at the end? <br/><br/>2) Most of the characters are morons. The inspector is in the middle of a major heist with national coverage and spends half her day getting coffee or hanging out with a guy she just met. She has a daughter too who she leaves with her Mum with Alzheimers? She also changes her mind every 2 seconds and just because she saw a red hair on his jacket she knew that he was now the killer instead of someone she fell in love with after 2 days? What?<br/><br/>3) The romantic relationships were ridiculous. Tokio and Rio makes no sense at all. Monica, supposedly a refined, smart lady falls in love with a total moron after 2 days and then starts shooting at the police officers? Really? The other girl starts sleeping with Berlin because she is scared even though they act like they are all mates half the time and bring them pizzas (from where?)<br/><br/>4) How many stand offs can you have? It was obvious they weren't going to shoot anyone so why did they keep pointing guns every two seconds. It loses its meaning when you do it every 2 seconds. Also why did Denver shoot Monica in the leg? He could have just not done that and I think everyone would have been OK with that it was not part of the plan and is very unnecessary.<br/><br/>I could go on all day.By the end you hate all of the characters and you will happen they will all take each other out just to end the show and make sure they don't do another series. This series has more holes than a sponge. Mastermind and team train 6 months to pull off the biggest heist of all time, then one by one try to screw things up. This show almost has a great story, but is let down by flaws so massive you just think WT¥. Unfortunately the holes get bigger towards the end hence more frustrating. For once a US version of a European show may improve on the original. The first episode got me hooked on the whole premise of the show and i thought the idea behind the heist was very interesting, but the more i watched the more i found myself rolling my eyes at some of the absolutely stupid decisions these characters make, including the supposedly supper intelligent mastermind "The Professor". I'm all for characters that have flaws and make mistakes but don't present the characters in your story as professional, intelligent, best of the best, and then in the next breath have them behave completely opposite of how you presented them. I also felt there were quite a lot of unnecessary story elements that were introduced solely to make the show last longer (a ton of fluff).<br/><br/>As for the positives...The show looks great, the acting was pretty good and the main plot was a great idea. I just feel in the end if they would have committed to telling this story in a contained and focused 8-10 episodes it would have been a truly great show. Sadly however it was not. Upfront: this is a Spanish series, and I'm an American who watched this on Netflix with the English dubbed over. It's likely much more appealing in Latin markets, but missed the mark for me. <br/><br/>The initial few episodes are intriguing, as they set-up what appears to be a relatively intelligent heist series. What develops is a melodramatic soap opera with pathetic character development and plot holes galore. <br/><br/>If you enjoy mindless afternoon soaps, this series is for you. <br/><br/>If you're looking for an intelligent crime thriller, do not let the first episode sell you like it did me. I'm disappointed in myself for having wasted the 20 or so hours and laughed at 90% of Season 2 to get myself through to the end. The positive first: cinematography and camera work are good and I also liked the soundtrack. The premise is pretty decent as well even though they ripped it off from Inside Man. And that was it. Why do people behave so stupidly when they plan a heist for such a long time? Why does the Professor put people like Berlin in there that are obviously not able to control themselves and stick to the plan? Why does the Spanish detective go on a date with some guy she met in a cafe during a raid that is international news? Why is the bug in the glasses not detected since it transmits to the professor? Why is Angel written like a telenovela character? Why is almost EVERYONE behaving so goddamn stupid in this? Arturito wants the SWAT-team to storm the building so they get rescued??? Everybody would be shot that way. Gunshot wounds heal in 10 hours. Women are generally emotional and irrational and need to show their bodies for no reason. The close calls are sometimes totally unbelievable. The positive reviews cannot be real because this is just a pretty soap with guns. This series is masterpiece...probably most of the haters comes from the US....there,they like to watch bs family comedy series...that's why a lot of good tv series like "The Expasne" is cancelled...La casa has his minor...tiny flaws...so what?Great actors,tension,agony and sexy Spanish language....the bad guys are the good guys and vice versa...and you know something?This is the thing in real life too...i'm tired of movies,showing the police as the good guys...they are not in many cases in real life...so respect to the writers of this show....finally,a little bit of truth....10/10...must see Until the episode 6 to 7 it was a master piece, 10/10.
But looks like it was hard to they keep dancing in the same rhythm.
The story start to looks cliche, the Professor lose it self, the woman(investigator) has no particular reason to stay with him.
I think in the beginning the plan was make him (professor) a real sociopath that was going to do anything to make that plan work. But they change it and make a garbage end (everybody is happy).<br/><br/>I'm really disappointed. After a certain point I think we need to stop being amazed that a show looks good (well done to the director of photography and the camera crew) and focus on the story. 
I wanted to binge watch something and this show was better that the average trash that is out there. But by no means this can get anything more than 7. 
The plot holes are big enough to plant trees in them, most characters are utterly stupid, do not develop and keep messing that "great plan" and although it is a close competition between the professor and Tokyo, the professor wins with his insane decision to get intimate with the worst possible person. 
There are worst things to watch out there. Hay cosas que pasan en la serie que me parecen absurdas!!!! Somany wth things that actor did and why,Did like that for what? Bahbahbah .they like a pro at first and soon you will know they Dumb robber. There is no way you would start this serie and not want to finish it ! Addictive Intense watch and lovely characters... good plots....... Well, crime shows are hard to satisfy the crowed, yet La casa de papel was able to impress me and I couldn't get enogh of it. The cast was amazing, they were meant to play their characters! I know if the show was good when I couldn't predict the events. And thankfully it was full of surprises! I watched this series in one go, without sleeping, it is definitely one of the best I ever watched. This spanish series in one great heist TV show that i totally recommend. It shares some resemblaces with Prison Break but it´s more about the personal relationships of the robbers, it's a more emotional story, but it never get's boring. For someone who want's to diversify from the usual american culture and TV, this is a very refreshing and original series. Don't get fooled by the low rating some users give. They probably never watched any series or movies that were not produced in Hollywood. Ths series is really good and makes you get involved with the characters. The characters are normal criminals who are led by a genius guy. So many twist and turns, will keep you glued to the tv This series is not just a one which has twist and turns, it is with a precise editing and storyline. It made people happy for the heist, and professor is one of a kind and mentor to me.
Berlin is so similar to Tbag in prison break.
"Bella Ciao"
Spain It is amazing how the writer wroted a story so complex and different like this. As we all watched series and films, the squad which is include of robbers or absconders are more intelligent than police department-FBI or what else opponents are. Except of one thing makes this series unbeliveable: The opponents are also smart. I never say "Oh no why they can't understand bla bla bla" or like this something. Just enjoyed with fiction and chill.<br/><br/>Talk about Dali(masks), common point Dali and Professor's squad is both of them don't accept big brothers system, ethic is relative each person. Raquel Murillo seems like affected 2. season final by Professor, after European Central Bank talk she helped Professor, yes it was about relationship about them but this was a near point i think, just a comment from me. And last comment about Dali and all other ideological opinion, this ideology in series is not socialism it is revolt to system.<br/><br/>"Si is importante, puedes usar el mío" It was like being on a holiday away from HOLLYWOOD very well done and needed. But strong warning DO NOT watch the dubbed version on NetFlix. After binge-watching all 13 episodes of the 1st season, I thought it would be a good idea to watch the dubbed version but the English ruins the brilliant work of the Spanish actors. First season is really good but as of mid 2 things go out of control. This series is anti government, never have I seen police depicted so incompetant like hello kitties.<br/><br/>I do not care about its anarchic leftist message... the intricacies and overall plot is very exciting yet their master argument is insultingly weak. Am I stupid to believe that armed career criminals (studying dutifully for 5 months :-)) are the solution to capitalist system's problems and Spanish police are stupid enough to forget disconnecting electricity? But hey, this is a .... "masterpiece" :-)<br/><br/>Seriously I wish they could come up with something that's decent at ideological level instead of this floor mat that tries to create a 1970s style militant leftist rebellion at the age of blockchain. (Assuming the series owners are not smart capitalists collecting dumb people's money)<br/><br/>And the pregnant mistress who fells in love with a violent thug (as officially depicted in the beginning) and finally turns into a machine gun toting criminal, how come she not turn into a giant spider and attack the city of Madrid :-)))))))<br/><br/>This is a shame for Spain and leftist/anarchist ideology but it's facebook generation watching so let's give thumbs up LOL!!! It's so overrated, i don't really like it, no difference from a mexican tv show. After listening to so much praise for Money Heist (La casa de papel), I came into this series with enthusiasm. Unfortunately, that enthusiasm quickly faded after seeing the first episodes. The story seems to have been written with some misogyny, presenting erratic, impulsive and thoughtless female characters, who fail every time they are in charge of anything. It is impossible to empathize with any of the characters, because they are all equally despicable. The lack of plausibility of some facts becomes laughable: elite police sharpshooters who cannot manage to shoot a single criminal, even when they are only a few meters away, and those wounded by bullets who miraculously recover in a few hours.<br/><br/>There is a whiff of communism that justifies the robbery of the National Mint, because the banks seem to get richer and richer as the people become poorer and poorer. Actually, it seems that for these modern-day Robin Hoods, the problem was not what the banks were doing; it was merely that they were not the ones doing it. This was their way of achieving "social justice." Therefore, they decide to print millions of euros to distribute among themselves, "the poor wretches" of the criminal gang. The main protagonist is, without a doubt, a beer company, Estrella Galicia, that accompanies the characters from the beginning to the end. I hope that the third season never arrives. Stay away from it! How this show get any positive reviews is beyond me. Dali masks, Red overalls, Ciao bella, revolution .. I have a lot of to say but my english is not enough for that . :) At least i can say that " it will be worth watching this awesome TV series ". Greet with my respect !! Best tv show ever even my favorites Game of Thronas and Breaking Bad Great acting 
Good story<br/><br/>I Love it.....<br/><br/>Its addicting.<br/><br/>Season 2 please. Masterpiece in every sense. Binge watched in 2 days. The show is full of ups and downs where you want the robbers to get away with it every time the police are close to catching them. The characters are all likable and getting to know each of them story and how their personality integrates in the heist is really interesting. The dialogue is very cliche other than that a decent show.. Storytelling very poorly crafted. Bad acting. It's ridiculous. If you don't want to waste your time, don't watch it. This serie hooked me in the first second. I watched the second season on spanish and its reallly one of the best series i´ve watched I do not want to say much because every little detail from the episodes worth it. All I want to say is that La casa de papel is an amazing serie with excellent actors, writers and direction. Perfect! Amazing! I hope the next season is coming up soon. Wonderful wonderful every word
I have seen several series and films from around the world, America and many countries, but this is very wonderful and the actors were more than wonderful, including (berlin, profesor, tokyo, rio, denver, mosco, nairobi,.....) I wish you success and more success of greetings to you from Morocco This is a total waste of time, and it doesnot even worth watching.
Very bad writing and full of fillers, despite the good first seson but all that follows is uust rubbish and the ratings show that people didnot like the growth of the characters nor the heist storylines or dialogues.
I really donot recommend it to anyone, it was a waste of time and money really. Season 1 and 2 are awesome , but 3 and 4 are boring Best that I saw!!!! You should to see it, you will feel everything that you will see in this series. In couple days I saw 2 seasons and I hope it's not will end. Love it! Recommending Well, I only finished S1 and S2 as i think that's prob where the original production ended. I'm guessing S3 and S4 are cash-in seasons so i won't ruin the series for myself.<br/><br/>But really, this series does a great job of investing in the characters with all of their strengths and flaws, the crime sequences are meticulously crafted story and the plot devices is thoroughly explained. With as complex a plot a this one, if course there are gonna be a couple of bandages to smooth out the logic, but compared to anything else I've seen, they're not too objectionable or groan-worthy.<br/><br/>Fun series, great performance, and great storytelling make this series a must-see. A joke of course, but much better then True Detective etc. La casa de papel.. Money Heist.. I personally think it's the best tv show ever.. for the rest of the 21st century!!!
Bella Ciao :D The storyline is absolutely ridiculous. This moronic hash of a robbery of epic proportions wouldn't have lasted half an hour in the real world. I'm sure Spain must have some kind of special forces or an elite military response team that would have put this farce to bed in no time at all. The robbers were mostly brain dead and constantly ended up pointing guns at each other. Where did this 'professor' recruit them from ? Probably a Wetherspoons pub or a an agent who manages extremely bad actors.. People who believe in tooth fairies and Father Christmas will love this bilge. I'll give it 4 out of 863 billion. I wish this never end I love this show so much please add more parts Hands down the BEST SERIES I have ever watched!!!!<br/><br/>Evoking heart felt joy & tears as I fell in love with the characters and ever twisting plot. Testament to everyone involved for all the love sweat and tears you have put into creating this masterpiece!!!!<br/><br/>I can not wait for season five...<br/><br/>GRACIAS <3 It just keeps you waiting for whatever's happening next
Addicting This series is a benchmark to the industry and raises every bar, right from acting to scripting. Every actor in the series delivered excellent performances. The cinematography is amazing. Every episode is highly gripping and makes you stick through the end. This is truly a 11 out of 10 rating worth series. The team is amazing and I hope they continue making new seasons of this series. I've binge watched the season 4 today for 7 straight hours and all I've got at the end is disappointment.
Professors unimpressive plans, poorly written characters & unrealistic scenes are the major drawbacks of S4. Hope they bounce back.<br/><br/>S4 Rating 7/10 Doesn't disappoint at all. Absolute entertainment and tension. Every second is enjoyable. Watch it again and again u won't get bored. Keep this up. Love the whole crew especially professor ♥ Every now and then a show slaps you in the face and says, "I'm great! You MUST watch me!" This is such a show. From the very first episode of season 1 you will be hooked into the intricate, fantastic plotting. The action is fantastic, but as the show grows it is the relationships that give it such ongoing force. Every actor/actress is marvelous. Hard, funny, impulsive, vulnerable in turns. It just grabs you and doesn't let go. I thought that it couldn't get better after season 2 then it DID! Wow. If this had been an American show it would have won dozens of Emmys. Just try it. You'll be glad you did. Its one of the best mankind creation in this field i have seen... Its a masterpiece... Actors have done their work more than best... Thanks to all thr team for providing such a great show Only seen first episode. Started a bit promising with a nice heist setup, which felt intriguing enough to make up for the bland choice of music and some ridiculous non-ironic slow motion shoots. But when the manuscript shows to be too filled with cliches and unnecessary stupidity I lost my interest to continue. How to enjoy this show? - Drink till you slur your words and you need 5 minutes of thought to recognize your favorite Actor/Sportsman.<br/><br/>Now you are at the IQ and attention level so that you won't be bothered by the plotholes, stupid characters and idiotic setups.<br/><br/>If you have consumed all worthwhile items on netflix/hulu/youtube, and watched millions of cat videos, and looking for something to pass your time while your write your noble prize acceptance speech. You want to focus 99% on the speech writing and use 1% of your brain to keep track of the story, then this show is for you. Compare to all the great and well written tv shows out there to choose from, this one feels like it was penned by a 1st year film student trying to make the grades. It was written so poorly and so amateurishly, I had to quit watching after the 5th episode. When you watched shows like Daredevil, Better Call Saul, and The Expanse just to name a few, then watching this after is like night and day! It's just pure garbage writing, you simply can't! This show is way behind on the curve, the writers seem to think they wrote a clever, smart script but in reality, they didn't. The main story line and sub-plots were uninspiring and boring to say the least! The characters are bland, one-dimensional, cliche, just simply uninteresting and for the most part annoying! There were several story arcs that I tried my best to get into but I just could not because I simply did not care for the characters! Bad writing is all to blame here! For it to get above 8.0 rating is mind boggling. This is horse manure story writing at its best! Don't watch this it will be just a waste of time. Trust me. And for the producers who think they made a well thought out tv series, think again! Your viewers are ten times smarter than this and can see right through all this garbage. Stop wasting both of our times, go back to school, re-invent yourself, and stop giving us this 5th grade writing! Everybody told me to watch this series. EVERYBODY
So i did... And i was completely disappointed about the really poor writing.
I can sit down and make a list about how many things that had a tremendous effect in the plot, were presented to us as a coincidence or were luckily discovered by the police or the thieves. 
SO MANY DAMN COINCIDENCES ARE THE BEST SIGN TO A BAD WRITING
In my opinion this series is the definition of a scriptwriter which seriously lacks talent or he was damn bored about writing a nice script. Watching the English-dubbed version it's a little hard to get into it but things pick up after 7-8 episodes. The "second" season has much more action and rapid pacing, leading to a satisfying finale. Underlying theme is a little socialist, printing and stealing money out of thin air, compared towhat the Euro Reserve Bank does on a major scale. Any reviews above a 4 are fraud/paid for. 
The Good - the plot
The Bad - most of the acting
The Ugly - the script and the story flaws<br/><br/>What a waste!!!! All we know what this series...is hugh, fantastic, a masterpiece, very good..etc..but is nothing we don't see before, is the perfect mix between good and crazy characters and the popular fantasy of the big hit or big robbery, every one of us dreams with make a hit like that, is something universal, stole to the rich with out damage some one.<br/><br/>All the series rest in a characters history and his dramas, while we see a perfect plan same to films like to, ocean's eleven saga, in sometimes too much dialogues and less action.<br/><br/>By fortune all the conflicts of characters are resolved, is a perfect escape, die who have to die, and some couples runaway togetter ..and that is it, is no more.<br/><br/>give to this serie other signification is denied the hide desire to the universal fantasy to be a "big hit". thats is the crucial and essential plot of the drama, same like "breaking bad", "back to the future" saga and many others...so don't confusse and just enjoy what this serie is, a mirror of your own fantasy...with a very crazy friends<br/><br/>good actors, the design production is very high, good photographic..perhaps 
the director sought to say many things and give many lessons and not a one clear message that inspires the viewer, for example "breaking bad" ...all for the family, "back on the Future" movie, we build our own future...so what is the lesson?...after to see Casa de Papel..<br/><br/>With all conflicts resolved, creating a third season is literally ....burning the paper Just finished season 2 in 2 days. Very nice serie with a lot of different varieties of scenes. The Spanish language didn't bother it me, actually I like it. Top of the bill drama serie with a fantastic story, must see! This is definitely one of the best shows i've ever seen This series is a masterpiece !!! everything is PERFECT Very smart and intersting tv show...Lots of unexpected moments and reactions Show started so normally that I told myself, maybe I shouldn't even start watching it. But the ordinary looking man in the car gets the criminal girl in his car and that got me, right there! In some parts of the show, I feel like everything's going according to the plan too well, everything's too smart and too good to be true. It goes on like this for a moment. But then that's where the show gets amazing, they start making fails. Their mistakes make you connect with the characters. We see their professional thief sides and their humany, secret sides. We learn their stories. It's definetely worth watching. It's not like one of those puzzle-crime shows. You don't have to push your brain's limit to guess anything. Show is very fluent very fastmoving. Probably one of the best things I've watched in years. I'm waiting to see more. This is the first time I watch a Spanish series and became a favorite series for me and I can see more than a hundred times I hope there is a third part The best work I ever watched lately. That harmony was great between characters and music in this serie.
What can I say more:)<br/><br/>I hope we can see more great works, like this one. This is for sure the best series ever. It is incredible how ridiculous are some people that doesn't accept the fact that are other series better than their preferred one. This is for sure the best series I've already watched, I couldnt stop watching it and I watched everything in 3 days. The actors are great! They are natural without any special effect.
And fuck your shitty technical problems that you have may noticed! I'm not a film-maker. I liked the show very much. you'll have a pretty good time. Every one of the episodes are breathtaking! 
Love it! This sÃ©ries is very beautiful.Especially in the field of intelligence and the crime. theCharacters is so amazing The good thing about the series Is plot and excitement Spain clearly doesn't get much Tv.<br/><br/>Gave it 2 episodes and was falling asleep Great,loving,best....no words.
I really into this series but i am giving 9 instead of 10 because of season 1 is not quite good as 2,3,4.
But its great one. You really have to see this. And my best part is the character "PROFESSOR" woah!!!
And my worst part is the "ARTURITO".ðŸ˜‚
And my intentions is not to criticize any character. Sorry for that. Concept is good but the story and direction helps to ruin everything.This series should be closed within season 2. Season 3 and 4 is unnecessary. I just write this review in the favour of character Berlin. They way he talk and the expression he beautifully delivered is just outstanding. Professor is also to good but Berlin is the best. I watched this in a single go on two days and whole four seasons get completed. The story is good as plan is beautiful planned by the professor and the situation is always making suspense everytime. Many people criticize the love drama inside, but in fact, the core of the crime drama is love drama. Love drama enriches every role, making them become flesh and blood rather than symbolic robbers, so we will stand in their position just like the people in the drama. I think this is getting popular because nowdays more and more teenagers have started to watch serieses and started to watch NETFLIX and PRIME VIDEOS (all beacuse of free/cheap internet connection across the country). The teenagers who are not having knowledge of what is the CLASS THING, what is MUST WATCH and what is MUST NOT WATCH. And another reason must be the LOCKDOWN across the world.<br/><br/>I have seen and liked all seasons of BREAKING BAD, PEAKY BLINDERS, GAME OF THRONES, SHERLOCK HOLMES, NARCOS, PRISON BREAK, PAATAL-LOK, SACRED GAMES, MIRZAPUR (Yes, I am Indian). This is for you to know which kind of person I am.<br/><br/>Whenever any movie or series getting famous (if I don't know much about its Director or Actors), I ask my friends whether it is worth or not. And I think all of us do this. This series was also being popular, none of my friends had watched it and there was completed LOCKDOWN so I thought to give it a try.<br/><br/>Even the first episode was disaster. The actors were not giving 100% dedication to their characters, I couldn't complete even the first episode. It was not going in proper direction.<br/><br/>So this is only hype. I wonder how many less knowledgeable people are there across the globe. If you are used to watch classic series and movies, do not go for it.<br/><br/>I REPEAT DO NOT GO FOR IT!!! What a series. Perfectly directed and perfectly executed by the actors. Full of action and romance. Really enjoyed. Awaiting next episode. Hope they release soon. Its one of the best series I've ever seen.
But i feel the story was just perfect and completed in season 2 My opinion may not be popular but I found many loose ends in some scenes for example such professional assassin like GÃ¡ndia didn't know for himslef how to escape handcuffs or how did Berlin and Palermo know all the details about the gold chamber or why Tokyo is just killing everything she touches she caused Moscow's death she could have caused Berlin's either and she started arguing with Palermo for nothing just girlish boss mind and ultimately caused Nairobi's death, though Professor ridiculously still defends her why really ? Others like Berlin his brother or Palermo did minor mistakes but professor got mad at them but he never get sad about the casualties Tokyo costs with her stupid stubborn fights against team leader she even caused her boyfriend's death and Rio's torture, still many loose ends and boring repetitives like Alicia acting exactly like Raquel or Pina only shows stupid things to kill good characters and more stupid things to keep awful characters like Tokyo alive It's refreshing! The beauty and good figure of the hostess is neuroticism, which is the time bomb of the team. Like Moscow, although a criminal, but is a good father. Changed rating from 8 to 2 after watching season 4. First 2 seasons were great. But as soon as this was hyped up here in India I got more excited about it but it ended up as a total dud. Used to be much better. Honestly, I have never been so addicted to a TV show like this one! From the beginning to the great finale in season 2! And then? Season three and four all the time it is only "up and down like a rollercaster" you never know what is coming! Can't understand how can anoyone be upset about it?! I seriously just wanted to see what everyone was so excited about it, but to my expectations it's just over hyped. BRILLIANCE, Not only the show has a solid story line but also perfection in execution. It's not one of the show you see and forget about! It shows how imperfect can a perfect plan be. The show connects with emotions and mend them in its favor... Again: BRILLIANCE.<br/><br/>This is my first 10 out of 10 show, not even Game of Thrones or Vikings or Breaking Bad passed this threshold for me! In last season creators of TV series showed us ,that they don't have creativity.Because they repeat same narrative ,again and again.In the begin it was good crime TV show with some plot holes ,but some way it was interesting.Characters weren't deep ,but they were memorable. The first 4 seasons could have been completed in 1 season with 8-10 episodes. 70-80% all of the scenes are long and drawn out with horrendous overreacting. Most of these performances would not make it in a burlesque show. While the show started as a Spanish staple, it made it to the International screens in no time and gathered a fanbase as loyal and dedicated as that of the big names such as Breaking Bad and GOT. Though I'll surely refrain from comparing it with the likes of the afore mentioned masterpieces, it'll be unjust to praise this one for its intelligently knit web of events and outcome. With heist movies and tv series making rounds in our To Watch List, the audience too have developed a knack of their own to determine what happens next. Money Heist strips us clean of that because it crushes our every anticipated move; atleast the first two seasons does. But as we spend more time with our beloved burglars, we learn to see through their characters- strengths and weaknesses, and once the very facet of unpredictability that made the show such a hit begins, turns it into what it shouldn't have been- slow and predictable. While the fourth season surely succeeds in picking up the pace, we are left wanting for more of that adrenaline rush and Professor's meticulous understanding of the art of a heist. But at the end of the day, Money Heist's biggest achievement will be to have millions of viewers sympathizing and rooting for the ones who are supposed to be the bad guys and hoping for a heist to become successful. Therefore, the series might not have achieved perfection, but surely it isn't one to be ignored. This show is amazing. The characters, the plot, the antagonists, the plot twists and turns, everything about this show is perfect. Every season has been spectacular and this is currently my favorite show. I would recommend this to everyone. Aactors are nices , good acting but not so realistic . the "professor" is always right .... no places for mistakes .a little bit boring at the end . Watched this Spanish series last week.<br/><br/>thankyou Netflix, have to say that Season 1 and 2 are Excellent. I loved the role of Professor, Nairobi, and Berlin. The plot is superb and keeps you on the edge of your seat.
.
Characters are superb and all actors have done a good job. With the way it ended in season 2 the expectations for season 3 and 4 were set high as everyone knows, there will be someone somewhere making some mistake. So, yeah I was ready for it.<br/><br/>BUT the 3rd and 4th seasons of the series ended up failing the expectation. Maybe because the plan was flawed and not set by the professor. So might be they made it look crazy?
.
The bar scenes from the past between Professor, Berlin, and Palermo were felt a bit stretchy. Arturo was not at all required but don't know if he will be utilized properly in upcoming seasons?<br/><br/>Of course, there was a need to kill someone but WHY Nairobi? Maybe the character had grown strong and popular, so they thought to shock the audience? Just like #GOT may be... But then eliminating Monica could have been better as no one knows about her past (to increase emotional attachment of the character, director could have build the character and killed it) and that she was pregnant! Would have sent equal shockwaves.<br/><br/>Too many bullets were fired on Gandia but none of it hit his prone body parts. Was he wearing bulletproof pant? What about the head? Ok, agree that the director did not want the Heist team to kill any civilian because then it would have turned them from thieves to murderers but a bullet on legs or arms could have done the work.<br/><br/>Hopefully, they come up with better execution of the plot in season 5 and 6 and maintain or exceed the expectation which was set by season 1 & 2. But please give a beautiful and logical ending to the series in season 6. I won't mind if the series ends in Season 5. Thing is that don't drag to make it lose its charm. Season 1 and 2 were great and amazing, I'd say 9/10. But then Netflix saw a chance to make money and prolongued this show into 2 unnecessary seasons that completely ruined this show. I'm just sick and tired of this by Netflix. This last season was a disaster, filled with unrealistic stuff. Stop before it's too late. The first two episodes are gripping with an interesting plot and even more interesting set of characters. Then, the characters make stupid decisions to create tension that just gets exhausting. Every episode there's a scene where the characters point guns at each other for no reason. At a certain point I had to ask myself, is this a show about a bank robbery or is it a confused romance show instead? It honestly became hard to tell. But, if you want brainless, in your face television, this is a perfect series to indulge. The gunfights in this show are so unrealistic, it's aggravating to watch. Hundreds of rounds being fired from within the same room or hallway and nothing hits? Wow! It's a long time since I've watched a series that gets you from the 1st episode- it leaves u being hooked!
A brilliant cast to audio dub, as original is in Spanish. A great story of the worlds biggest money heist in history, hitting a Spanish bank and printing millions of euros, which they plan on escaping with.
Along with unexpected twists n turns as well as a few love stories, makes this a must watch series!
10/10<br/><br/>Plus "the professor" the character itself is extraordinary and Álvaro Morte did full justification to the character!
Just found out they are doing season 5! CAN'T WAIT for it to be released. I do hope they get a happy ending. I heard much about money heist. When started see this ... 1, 2, 3, 4, ok but further it's boring. I was surprised when I see microphone in glass and battery life and frequency is awesome. Ok ok but 2 episode ahead the professor has so much guts he can speak russian and threatens to garage worker and known the garage worker sitting front of computer and very good to know about delete professor sketch. Boom he is divine and makers of show is like profesor or step forward. First of all seeing a movie like this somewhere else other than in an American city was really cool. This daring concept of these heists were AWESOME. I've always loved to see professional criminals pull off a brilliant heist and out smart the cops and all their resources. Again the concept of these heists were awesome. Too bad the mastermind "Professor" was too stupid and ignorant to hire professional smart criminals to pull this off. He hired the keystone cops instead. All that people did for the first 3 seasons was point a gun at each other and scream. Twice the police "snipers" had shots to take and the were all non lethal shots. What a slap in the face actual Spanish police snipers must feel. I had high hopes but was very disappointed. Get a clue. Let's see true brilliant likable criminals that are actual bad asses and not a bunch of emotional unstable wimps. First two seasons were melodramatic, but veery interesting to watch, but from third it is unbearable. "Money Heist" or "La casa de papel" is a series whose success resides solely in its capacity to entertain the majority of us. But from an strictly technical point of view, Money Heist survives as a concatenation of sensacionalist sequences that are full of implausibly acquired technology and completely unnecessary moments to generate this constant tone of showmanship. When it comes to the script, despite having some interesting and well-written parts like the relationship between Berlin and Palermo in fourth season, the series abuses the deux ex machina trick making the plot and its formula become pretty bland, predictable and poor. Loved the concept and writing. The best watched till date a big fan of professor. Season 4 would have been a very nice season. Gandia and Lisbon should have been settled with from episodes 1-4, while the other episodes should be used for escape. Season 5 should be focused on escape alone, because right now it's the only things fans want to see. The show starts with done to death bank heist and makes most ridiculous heist ever.<br/><br/>Inside Man, although full of plot holes, was decent enough movie. This makes Inside Man Oscar material.<br/><br/>There are bunch horrendous turn of events no sane person will believe and then the story which is beyond ridiculous and makes you question how come one believe this at all.<br/><br/>This is perfect example how a no logic full garbage show can be made... I rate this series 7/10 I came here just to change my review from the 9 points I gave the first season (parts 1 + 2) to 7 for the full series.
Part 4 is so bad it hurts... You can learn being smart and caring, it contains the whole idea about that. But i don't understand the idea of season 3 & 4 or we should expect another season with a proper ending. It's oke. Entertaining enough. But all the melodramatic talking between important plot 'twists' are just unbelievable and boring as hell. When this episode start in netflix, no matter story, art style, all is Bold innovation. Every episode Will look forward to see the next episode.<br/><br/>But when this season came out, give me a same format like season 2.
Berlín dead = Nairobi dead
Río back = Raquel Murillo back<br/><br/>not enough plot like catch me if you can . Hope can see next episode. Best web series that contain thirller action story suspense in crime drama series that best Good series, but stopped watching at the end of S3E2.... Lost complete interest, and the reviews weren't very good about S3 and S4.... And it shows in the first two episodes in S3.
So my advice? Stop after Season 2 The perfect and infallible crime only exists in the ideal, because human resources are poor after all, and people's psychology and feelings are the most difficult to predict, so it is precisely because of the constant mistakes and omissions that it appears true. No perfect plan can keep up with the changes in people's minds. They should have signed Keanu Reeves to play GandÃ­a, after all the way he dodges bullets is definitely like The Matrix.
Series 4 is still very much entertaining, although there's too much going back to memory lane and not enough real time action. If I hadn't watch any heist movies, I'd say this is the best. But so far, this is just above average. People are living professors role. It's a crazy series complete entertainment. Must watch. I don't get the few negative reviews I've seen in here. This show is phenomenal. I agree that some stuff are not realistic, but who said this is supposed to reflect real life. This is cinema, fiction at it's best. Some people said that it should've ended after season 2. I personally think that it could have definitely ended with the second season because a full story was delivered in 2 seasons, however, the fact that the writers were able to re-develop a completed perfect story into a new superb one that spanned over 2 extra season is absolute genius. As everyone is saying, they should have stopped after season 2 or 3 the latest. But season 4 is a real s*hit show. It was sooo boring. I only watched it because my gf is Spanish and still wanted to watch it...if you don't have to - don't do it. (Talking about season 4) Very very very bad writing. How could you ever write this scene?? Referring to episode 6 of season 4. Immidiately stopped watching the show. Words cannot describe the feeling. Did not deserve this. Shame on you. Amazing show, I started watching to check what is crazy about it and now I am addicted From the first frame I started liking it. The professor steals the show in season 1 2 and 3. But the same professor who is the most loved character in this series is totally ignored in season 4 which brings disappointment for money Heist fans. Overall very good season except season 4 but still waiting for season 5 just because of the professor.
Direction and acting topnotch and is definitely a must watch series.
P.S.- don't make too much expectation with season 4. Brilliant is a perfect word to describe everything about this show. Watched the entire 4 seasons during the COVID lockdown and enjoyed it thoroughly. Hoping for season 5 soon. Season 1: 10 stars
Season 2: 10 stars
Season 3: 6 stars
Season 4: 1 stars<br/><br/>I think you can skip to season 5, yes it's that bad. How can somebody like this series? I have a long list of complains but i will write a few of them here:<br/><br/>1. Why are the kidnappers and hostages horny all the time? One of them even rapes another hostage, btw he was not even kidnap in the first place!<br/><br/>2. Who sings a church song in the middle of a shooting<br/><br/>That is just a few examples. But the series is horrible! First 2 seasons it was great and loved my time to watch. Then 3th Season with similar story, you can see while you are watching what's coming next! So where is the excitement on this and what is the point? Just ended where it suppose to be! And now you will come with season 5 and it will follow 6, 7, 8...just funny :) From the plot, to the characters and to the cinematography, this series is mind blowing. It has some of the best characters I have seen. I love the way its executed. There are some very good scenes and some that don't captivate you as much.<br/><br/>I would give it 10 if some scenes were more logical and believable. First of all, first chapter was awesome. Proffesor had thrown curves. Second chapter was good. Also third chapter wasnt boring. It was different and original atmosphere. But I cant say anything about fourth chapter. I watched just flashbacks. They know we missed Berlin and they used this trump. They showed us Berlin,Berlin,Berlin...
I couldnt finish last chapter. I was really bored because of flashbacks. My rate was 8/10 before the newest session, but now it regress 2/10 U have no idea The amount of scenes' i had to skip, believe me, I'm a tv addictor and i know when things are hellaa boring, plus if u Gonna watch every scene in this show, its good but do know you're wasting your time , Imagine Watching 2 parrots talking to each other and fighting and they ends up bestfriends it's exactly like this with most of characters ...just talking talking and talking
but its a rlly good show that I haven't seen in a while! It was reasonably good series at the start especially in the first three parts.
Apart from extra dragging the story line and drab emotions of every character, it performed reasonably well.
But the season 4 put a serious halt into its success.
Just dragged the story without any rich content and ended the season without any result.
Season 4 would put a serious damage to its popularity. It's third season and still the series blend in. However, I found a great deal of emotional and unnecessarily long scenes regarding lovers. Please don't turn up a crap. I truly believe Casa de Papel is one of the most gripping series ever made for television. I breezed through series 4 in 3 days, even though there's a downgrade in quality versus previous seasons.<br/><br/>Why is it so good?<br/><br/>There's action at every turn. The stakes are constantly raised for those robbers and therefore so is the viewer's attention. It keeps you glued to your screen throughout.<br/><br/>Not only that, is does so while creating 1) compelling characters (who you root for) and 2) the narrative that this convoluted heist is much more than that. There's a reason why the Salvador Dali masks have broken from the screen and into our generation's culture - the characters seem to be part of a bigger feeling of anti-establishment, revolt. And as an audience, that definitely makes you more engaged.<br/><br/>The closest thing I can find perhaps to the first 2 series of Casa de Papel, is the first season of Prison Break. Never a dull moment, incredibly involving characters and full of heartfelt moments and suspense at the same time.<br/><br/>The only downside of Casa de Papel is a natural one - it felt a victim of its own, unprecedented success. It's no accident it is the most successful non-English language show on Netflix.<br/><br/>But as the creators tried to stretch the narrative for more seasons, it became less compelling. A new heist felt less believable, the human bonds between the robbers felt too forced and more corners were taken in terms of storytelling to advance the story.<br/><br/>Series 3/4 are not as bad as some reviewers claim here, but indeed you should expect some decay in the show's grip.<br/><br/>That being said - this is still very much worth a watch. Especially you are after a compelling, binge-worthy show. You needn't look further. The first 2 series will not disappoint you for sure. It is the perfect show to introduce English speaking audiences to quality television done beyond that realm.<br/><br/>PS: the score throughout the show is on point. It brought back Bella Ciao into people's imaginary, but many episodes absolutely nail the chosen soundtrack. Another aspect worth praising the creators for. For sure make you happy and enjoy yourself for watching this series Professor character is the name of loveðŸ’™and Berlin also. Egypt has been mentioned in First episode of Season 4 when Tamio told the it manager to disrupt the internet in their place like what happened in Egypt in 2011. And Since am from Egypt, I like the idea how they pointed to how governments go beyond to crackdown on freedom of opinions. What a good scene This is byfar the best show ever on netflix. If u havent watched this series yet, believe me it is worth all the hype. U will get hooked to this as soon as u watch the first episode. Only few series can make this in their first episode itself (like prison break, breaking bad, stranger things). This is one of the best series out there on Netflix End of season 3 it becomes almost childish..! Still wondering what all the hype is about this show..! Too many loopholes, draggy and senseless scenes..! The episode list is wrong. First season has 13 epidoses and second has 9. Could somebody fix that?
Btw it is my favourite show of all time, simply brilliant script, with extraordinary acting. I fell in love with Money Heist since episode 1. I love the cast and the way everyone played their roles. Just finished it and i would watch it again, best tv-series. The third season was just awful and unwatchable, I give 6 stars for the first two seasons. I came late to this show but wow! I have read some criticism of the show but really
would it not be boring to be executed perfectly? There are flaws, sure, but overall pretty damn good. A very clever script; excellent actors; some nail-biting stuff and great camaraderie amongst the thieves. Television is supposed to either educate or amuse. This certainly kept me entertained! Good but with a lot of childish mistakes.
Could've been better I believe , too bad... Part 1 is great, and you can't wait for Part 2 once you've finished Part 1. Part 2 however destoys the Inspectors story arc and once the police start stepping in, we can see that they are about as useful as stormtroopers. A friend of me told me to wactch this series but i didn't thought thought that i will be an incredible and must watch type series,when i started watching it i became addicted because of the story,character and directional perfection.I u want some thrill,amusement and real fun then must watch this. I avoided this show for months looking at the reviews which say it's overrated. I won't believe from now on. You watch it yourself and decide.
I specifically made account for this review. If you're a fan of Prison Break, Dexter etc this show will hit the right spot. It will scratch the itch you have for wanting to watch Brainy psychological warfare. Money Heist Is on of the best web series i have ever seen. *Compete session 1*
Money heist<br/><br/>Generally I don't write reviews but this time I'm so overwhelmed and thrilled , I must say this is a true masterpiece.<br/><br/>
My ratings<br/><br/>Cinematography 10/10
Cast 10/10
Professor 11/10
Few minor plot holes but you know nothing is perfect<br/><br/>GREAT!!! Probably one of the best Netflix series I have seen so far. unpredictable and overwhelming plot, this series so addictive that one will definitely complete it in one time . Professor the mastermind of the heist who spends half of his life planning the biggest robbery in the history with backup plan for each and every point.
*This is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED SERIES* Please see this on your vacation. Cause if u start watching this, u won't be able to skip watching before you finish. Stories are so inter locked & not a single moment here is boring. I find the serie not very realistic.Because it is not possible for criminals to enter so easily such a secured building whith so many secrets inside and so well guarded.
For me it is so impressive that the teacher anticipates all the mouvement of the police , it is so impressive that it seems unrealistic La casa de papel is just amazing! I love the series where you think it has reached it's peak, but it just keeps on getting better and better and better. I was stuck after watching the first episode, and it's just amazing, not really much more to say. I have recommended this to every one I know and I've watched it two times myself. Love it! Season 2 is a masterpiece, and whilst a little outlandish at times, uses scientific principles incredibly well....a very well written show. The introduction of Sierra is a beatiful way of getting rid of the Deus ex el professor that made this show frustrating to watch beforehand. Its unlike any other web series you have ever seen. It will keep you on the edge of your seat whereas at the same time expose you to whole another level of entertainment. Every character of show is beautifully written and execution is perfect. It will keep you craving for more. Season 1 was really good and then it becomes so illogical and tedious.
Most irritating to watch is Tokyo's character who keeps making mistakes and nobody says a thing. Equally annoying is the storyline between Tokyo and Rio. I just keep hoping not to see them on the screen.
Other characters and actors seemed fine.
Overall it's a watchable series because of the decent direction and acting by some of the key people. Also, English audio could have been better dubbed, there is a lot more depth and character in the original Spanish audio version. It's a epnderful series, waiting desperately for forth fourth season Maybe the best series I have ever watched. It has everything Love friendship fights laughter fear... It's totally unpredictable it keeps you in a constant agony from the beginning until the end The casting is amazing and the directing is one in 1 million you just can't pause it ! Fast paced, Thrill, Action 10/10...Perfect crime series package. First of all, I should begin by saying I've seen this series before. It is all a good remake of the series "La Casa de Papel". Yet it still is fun.
If you follow it carefully you will be able to find simple equation that won't match. That is the amount of things they have inside minus the things they brought in. Somebody please tell me for God's sake, there did they find those welding machines, tanks, masks, suits, guns, more ammo, cigarettes, scuba stuff. Let alone the dummy guns.. And besides stuffing all somewhere those 100 people including hostages do not eat and drink hopefully..
It is fun to watch if you fast forward some of the most idiotic dialogues ever. Why do they even argue all the time?! One final thing. Agent Sierra should be all cut out because of her "I think I act very well but I am a disgrace joker which does not even exist in circus" behaviour. This show is so smart and interesting, I'm not left bored even for a minute just clear up your schedule when you start watching it because you're gonna want to binge-watch a whole season in one sitting. If you wanna test a series or a movie and know how good is the storyline, predictability is the assessment. The flow of the events and the intelligent twist throughout the course of the series can simply tell that is one of the greatest series in recent time.
Although, the series has kinda political view which socialism and whether you accept or agree with what they try to address or dictate the direction and the great job by the writer and the cast make you hooked up to it. I felt I am watching some 80s show.... I would have stopped at season two and would say down the line in the history of heist genre tv series. La Casa De Papel was one of the greatest show on earth. It has let me down.. Once again, the team showed us the full potential of artistic approach in contemporary creative process.
If I leave professional critics, I should not observe other critics, but as 'user review' I could just make a point on 5 star and less reviews. The note and review in this case is the reflect of their own life. A lot of hate, and nothing more. I don't think that they even watched the serie! It is a very good show, especially seeing it as being from Spain. I read that this is Netflix most watched non-US production.<br/><br/>The actors are really great and charismatic. I love the mastermind behind the robbery. I gave it a 9/10 when I was close to the finish of season 2. But than it became more and more unrealistic. Especially in Season 3 it cannot hold up to the standards set before. So I only can give a 7/10 so far for Season 3. (still 2 Episodes left to watch). So I downgraded my vote to 8/10 overall now.<br/><br/>Still something worth watching. Great season 1 and 2 will keep you at the edge of ur seat through out the whole show. It's a great show to watch if your looking for something to do to pass time great 40 min episodes which don't fail to entertain. Season 3 might not be asss good as the rest however it could possibly have potential to carry on as good as the previous ones I've watched quite a few subtitled films and TV shows lately so I decided to be lazy and watch the dubbed version of this. I'm currently on S1 E4 and it's an excellent TV drama - strong characters, great story, high tension.<br/><br/>OK, one expects American actors to do Netflix dubbing but, when it's all so obviously set in Spain, with several early references to euros as the currency to be stolen (*very* early - no spoiler there), do we really need to hear characters talking about "Homeland", "State", "the DA" and "bucks"? Are Americans really so insular that they need to be fed familiar references for fear that anything vaguely foreign may turn them off?<br/><br/>That's insulting to non-Americans and, I'd like to think, insulting to most Americans too. Can't stop watching! Exciting and educational. Love the Spanish environment of the scene. Good to great. It is not among my best shows ever,but I'm gonna give it a firm 9.
Highly entertaining but lack of any meaningful message taht actually matters. The opening two seasons were phenomenal ones ,top quality edge of the stuff.I couldn't sing high enough praises ,and recommended it to anybody who would listen.<br/><br/>Unless you having something in line to top that or come close to it,then i think you should wait until you do.It is great to see the gang back together of course,and it wasn't terrible.I will wait see to how this chapter comes to a close with season 4 before casting a true reflection ..<br/><br/>Definitely watch it if reviews are putting you off,form your own opinion,it was not the worst binging experience ever. After the ending of Part 2 of the series, I was uncertain about how the story would turn in the coming parts. As expected the writers were faced with many loose ends and holes that needed to be filled in the new season. Although noticable, it was done well. The plot is similar yet different than what weve seen before giving it a refreshing feel to the series. Well done overall. Niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiice If there was ever a book written, on how to make a tv series, then this show should be among the top there is. It's the sheer captiveness of the story and smart story telling that puts this show at a whole new pedestal.<br/><br/>A simple story broken down to a million pieces of a puzzle, that keeps getting into shape through each episode, is a mark of a brilliant thriller, and this show nails the draft.<br/><br/>It keeps the audience hooked, excited and at the edge of curiosity, with each episode, like baiting a fish on to a fishing rod. The actors have delivered a well written piece with complete honesty and commitment, which shines through the series.<br/><br/>The twists and turns throughout the story line are engrossing for a binge watch. That rarely is the case nowadays, for a series moving to a 3rd season.<br/><br/>If you are fan of good content, which is pacakaged intelligently, to cater to your mind bugs, then this one is a keeper!<br/><br/>TV show makers should take a leaf out of this Spanish book of tv series, as this one blows many of them outta park. All the performances are superb. Especially the professor. This is a piece of art every movie lover wants to watch. It has all needed in to watch endlessly-narrative, plot twists, love, betrayal, humor, phrases ready to quote. Characters so well depicted like you know them and you want to be your closest friends. I can't stop watching and so afraid it will end soon. Entertaining master crime and crazy implausible love story (stories). Spain must have worst shooters in the world, rubber bullets and clueless police. Satisfying, cartoonish wrapup in S2. Watch with subtitles. I season is enough for this story. Season 2 makes it boring. A must watching TV series. First 2 seasons were very good.Fitst Netflix did huge mistake on season 3 and 4. This TV show is like the best possible way to portray the concept of Heist. The backgrounds, the costumes, makeups, clever idea of using names of cities is genius. But most of the time they were not properly engaged with hostages, They were roaming around with handcuffs and all. That is a little casual. and that "hostage of the month" was awesome. I had very high expectations for this show, in the end it was so so it fell short, at the end of the day I ended up hating the characters and without affinity with them my desire to continue watching the show ended. This is the type of show you need to sit back and enjoy without thinking too much.<br/><br/>If you do that then it's a highly enjoyable fun heist plot with some interesting twists and a decent balance of calmness and action. I really enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Of course at the same time in your head you will be thinking..... why don't the police just do this? why on earth is this person so utterly incompetent? (both police and robbers).<br/><br/>But let that go and the show thoroughly deserves its place as the most watched non-English show in the history of Netflix.<br/><br/>Hugely recommended There were some flaws but overall it was a good show. And the character development was pretty strong especially the professor. It's not just another "Netflix Original" series, is an experience that you hardly skip... An awesome TV show to binge which will leave you on edge on every episode. This series is great but it has very big flaws in IT and gunfight.
Really bring this down when you see big guns fired by Tokyo when running away, police with no aim.
Computer expert will cry too sadly. It keeps me! I love Berlin! The best Spanish TV serie! One of the best series I heve ever seen!I am waiting dor the next season... Great plot! Cool scenario with a lot of twists. You end up wishing the "villains" will escape. Nice cast also and loved to see all episodea in spanish Most see it... I really enjoy watching it i be so excited to watch the next episode... I wish I could watch it for the second time like the first time!! The plot is very well written, although the performance of the characters may not be the most appropriate in some moments. In any case, there is a constant climate of uncertainty, which always unfolds in totally unexpected resolutions. Without many "clichÃ©s", this Spanish production manages to compete in equality with those produced by the cinematographic industry. Worth following! Well organized, thrilling, entertaining... a full package that makes you eager to watch the next episode. Even though the series is in Spanish bit you can be sure you will understand everything and you will not be disappointed. Unbelievable script, direction, acting and above all a script and editing, all leading to perfection. You may have seen or read a lot of spoilers but inspite of reading it please see this show. It's nonconformist, it's made to perfection and it's gripping in a nice happy way. I can write so much about it but will leave it at a ....go watch it. Safe to watch on a flight and no nudity etc. one of the best there is in Netflix. I was really surprised by this series. When I was watching the first episode I thought that this cannot be a good series. I mean, another story about the heist, loads of planning, loads of shootings and big escape. Well, I was wrong and I enjoyed the show very much. The concept is really simple, but with many twists and additional plots. The characters are interesting and we can't really predict their actions. Also the way in which the series was shot deserves a recognition, maybe except shooting scenes. I feel they went too american-style on these. We can also find some slow-motion scenes and to be honest they seem a bit overdone, but not completely pointless like in an American heist movies. The fact that the actors speak Spanish is also a nice addition (of course if you turn off the horrible dubbing), and even though I don't understand it (watching with subs), I got a feeling that it feels really nice to hear all these emotions that the actors can express in their native language. Also, you get a feeling of something new and different from that. I can definitely recommend it who loves an existing story and great actors. Dayi bu ne aman aman bulasmayin dikkat edin bagigmlilik yapar uyutmaz I enjoyed every single second of this mind-blowing serie! This might be my first review and the shortest of all, but short doesn't really mean that I have got no good words for this show; this show's a genuine masterpiece. The acting, the casting, the plot, the progression and the title of course makes this show literally ONE OF THE BEST. It's going to make history and the coming generation is going to watch it like The Shawshank Redemption. For anyone still having doubts about watching the show, I must say give it a try. You'll definitely LOVE this. Surprised to see bad reviews! Funny looks like people either love it or hate it completely. Probably the haters are watching it in English instead of Spanish! You need to watch it in the original language and use subtitles if you do understand the language. My Spanish is not good enough to understand but with subtitles it s perfect! I was Searching so long for a Serie like that. Unbeliveable masterpiece. From beginning till the end so good. Possibly because it's in spanish and well produced, with good special effects, there has been great hype about this show in Latin America. And at a first glance it does look great. However as you get familiar with the characters an the story you start to notice poor acting and a highly predictable script and storyline. I cannot understand all the top reviews of this show. I won't call it complete garbage, but I'm not far from it. <br/><br/>Cheesy characters with sound editing that is so ridiculous you tend to LOL when you hear some of the voices connected to the actors they are supposed to portray.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you're bored and have watched everything else on Netflix, then this will fill some time, but if there's just about anything else to watch on TV, I would suggest you pick that instead. The script is like a Swiss cheese though, therefore dont pay too much attention, sit back, relax, and enjoy great actors Best heist series I have ever seen.
Excellent character development. Brilliant plot and attention to detail.
BRAVO!
Can we pray for Part 3...?! Great plot. Suspense that keeps you watching till the end. At every turn you see a perfect plot to rob a money making place. The plan is perfect. Everything is carefully planed and the Professir thinks of it all. You've got to watch it. The performances are great! The character building, the relationships they build while in captivity. Just awesome! Watch it! You won't be disappointed! 8 episodes in and I regret starting, it had a good initial plotline thats let down by some strangely idiotic characters, but most importantly it is awfully dubbed with very poor voice actors which makes it much harder to engage with and get into and is not very gripping, might have been better with the original spanish audio and subtitles, dont understand how there are so many rave reviews for this, it is certainly not deserving of the 8.7 imdb score, its not in the same league as many other programs with lower scores Oh my God! I can't put into words how great this show is! The acting is fantastic and I actually cared for the main actors/actresses. The heist was fascinating to see thought out and actually carried out. The ending also gets you right in the feels. I can't waiy until season 3 in 2019! Fantastic series loved every minute! A must watch! One of the best series i ve ever seen
Great acting
Great story 
Great plan
. The narrative, the plot, the depiction of vulnerabilty of heist men, the confidence of the plan being full proof and yet the unfolding of events which were never thought of, was amazing. Every character esp. Berlin and El Professor are pleasure to watch and as the series builds, you feel As if you are one of them.
"muchas gracias por un regalo increÃ­ble" It is easily digestible, and that is perhaps the recipe for success of this series. Of course there are smarter series with more depth - but who says it has to be like this? The bad reviews are justified, but the series doesn't want to do it any differently. The series entertained me greatly (even if there are some logical flaws); a light meal after a strenuous working day with pseudo-intellectuals. Just what " I " needed. Ciao bella. I believe this is the first spain TV show I have ever watched and it's great! Must watch this show its amazing love the story and the idea its great 
Also in eglish its good too Amazing script, actors and sets. Original in all aspects and it's gonna take something sublime to top this series in a similar category. Exciting start but they cant't keep up the excitement during the episodes. I like to watch Casa, but it becomes predictable. It is an amazing series, the actors, director, write, scripter, all were amazing.<br/><br/>Each episode had its gripping moment. Full of thrillers and action. I have seen a lot of tv series and this was hands down one of the best. So many twists and turn and suspense i couldnt stop watching. Was late for work 3 days in a row because I couldnt stop pressing next episode. 11/10 about to re-watch. Buenas noches! This show is so good. I was very reluctant to watch it when all my friends told me to. I am a Spaniard and I've never been very fond of Spanish TV or movies but when just half way through the pilot I fell in love with the show. The characters are great, they have great stories and their names fit them perfectly. The story is very refreshing and original too. I have enjoyed Series 1 on Netflix. Good to see the latter putting out European drama at last. However, the excellent plot and cast are let down somewhat by the horrendous dubbing. Seriously, some of the voice-overs are totally wrong and really detract from the pacing of the plot and my understanding of the characters. I really would have benefited from subtitles. Also I don't quite understand why they changed the title. My vague understanding of Spanish leads me to believe that the title is 'Paper House' or similar. Why Money Heist? Sounds imfantile and does a great programme a disservice. One of the best shows on Netflix. They take risks American shows don't. And now Netflix is making a third season!! I postponed my self to start watching because it wasn't in English ... but when you start, you can't stop!
It deserves even more my respect!
Great work, good story, good characters.. 
Just announced today a third part in 2019... hope the good work continues. It was enjoyable without being great. Sorta James Bond! Some of it is a bit hard to believe. Still I watched it all. No Mindhunter, but watchable! Money Heist is a good watchable series. But I don't see why or how this is getting the recognition as one of the best series ever. It's not. To be honest, the series is lagging most of the episodes and picks up pace in the final episodes only. And I didn't like the Season 4 ending much too. It felt just like any other episode. The performances are not great apart from Berlin, Palermo and few others. I hate most of the characters. I'm being so pessimistic because it's getting over optimism from many others. Overall, it's a compelling watchable series. Does not make any sense at any point,
Total -. s h i t
I bear the show till 2nd season s 6 episode, just hoping for it to get better but naaa naaa .<br/><br/>Strictly prohibited ,<br/><br/>Below average show.<br/><br/>Find a better show to watch.<br/><br/>Will never forgive Netflix for this one.
So far worst show of mine. Why are so many people complaining that this is unrealistic? It's a show about robbing the Bank of Spain! (Well part 3&4 anyway) if it was realistic then wouldn't people do it in real life!? These people are criminals and everyone expects them to be rational and logical? Come on.<br/><br/>This show was creatively thought out and has great character development. And it's not your typical character development, it's different and sometimes unexpected, which is refreshing. Each character plays a very different role and they make it blend together nicely. Part four had a foreseeable incident that I really didn't want to happen, but it did. Narobi was certainly one of the strongest leads imo. It's definitely worth a watch. I live in Iraq, This is the best series I have ever watched, I highly recommend to everyone... Thanks for all the staffs This is a perfectly crafted masterpiece of all tv series in the WORLD!!
Lot of messages,
Lot of emotions,
blood pumping moments,
heart freezing actions.
unexpected twist and turns.
and pure brilliance.<br/><br/>the cast is perfect, the direction is phenomenal, the story is out of the world.
This is perfection at its best.<br/><br/>the best tv show ever seen in any language.
and they will always be in our heart This is one of the show which grasps you from the beginning up to the end. It has all the drama, thrill, story, and the mastermind that makes this series the perfect heist series. It is one of the greatest thing that came out of Netflix Spain. This series has all the characters that make a greatest heist of SPAIN. In short, it is a perfect heist series. It's a must see series! One of the best I ever seen. Two thumbs up! I am almost through the 3rd series and can honestly say there had not been a moment where I haven't been immensely entertained and enthralled.<br/><br/>Fantastic characters set in really smart plots and great cinematography. Slick made for TV series that would do well on the big screen except that I wouldn't want to cut a minute!<br/><br/>Watch in the original soundtrack you avoid it sounding corny!!!<br/><br/>Just love it!!! Can't stop watching. Impossible to unlike the story. If you like movies like the italian job, than this show is for you. The drama doesn't really go off track when it came to presenting a well planed heist. Although there were some predictable parts, the overall result was wonderful. The performances were, as well, top notch. Another plus about this series is that the pace is well managed, so, even though the events take place during the course of a few days, the audiance doesn't fell bored. However, I do feel a bit uneasy about season three, as the heist is over after season two. The idea is good but messed up characters with many points unconvincing. Deliberately prolonging the story. The plot of the series is intelligent and promising during the first few episodes, but after a while the story becomes more and more ridiculous: dozens of highly trained special police forces seem to be the dumbest and clumsiest police in the universe, firing thousands of bullets without hardly ever hitting any clear and unprotected targets, while the robbers never miss a single shot and are always 50 steps ahead. So ridiculous it become frustrating. It could have been good! If only they fine-tuned it to ONE season only, including the complete heist.<br/><br/>Characters hold such promise...Berlin, Nairobi and Professor 
They might have been professional but still with a personal touch. Instead we are slowly introduced to idiots and plotholes. <br/><br/>What a letdown!<br/><br/>I can believe the Stockholm Syndrome but they took it far. It would've been believable if there was only ONE love interest. Even Berlin fell victim. <br/><br/>Above all, the characters didn't even seem in control most of the time! Even the hostages could do whatever they want. In reality, however, people tend to MAXIMISE their abusive power as shown in WW2 and in Prison research. Empathy is unbelievable from the perpetrators, only believable from outside forces (Professor) <br/><br/>Due to it's feminist narative I had to skip most of season 2. From 'mary sue', to woman losing custody (90% DON'T) and ridiculous emotional BS. The dialogue became unbearable and I felt a victim of the shows "sunk-cost fallcy" (already invested too much time now I need to the ending). <br/><br/>If I could go back in time I would not recommend to myself! From Berlin to Moscow, Rio to Tokyo, 
Denver, Nairobi, Helsinki & Oslo
The professor & Raquel Murillo, 
This was by far the best tv show I washed since breaking bad.
I washed it all in 3 days. A spanish Masterpiece, just will say that.............................................................!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm glad i finished the series without a heart attack haha, unlike other series that are 50min of boredom with only a good cliffhanger, La Case de Papel is INTENSE all the way through. Its straight to the point with some good parallel stories so we get to know the characters. It has a great message against capitalism, with communist anthem. The first season is better than the second, but the whole experience is amazing. I have only positive things to say about this series. One of the best writing I've seen in a long time. All the characters are different and interesting in their own way. The plot is fresh and unpredictable. The best a series can get, be it the acting, direction, screenplay, dialogue writing, dialogue delivery anything it is the best, and clearly it is not one of the best, it is the best series, the gluing effect it has on you, the suspense and all those are just beyond anything. Do watch it. This is one of the best series I have ever seen in my 45 years of life. The plot, the acting, the action, the cinematography, the non-stop plot twists...I can't say enough about it. Netflix is kicking a$$ with this series as well as all of their other series from Spain. If you haven't seen it already.. JUST DO IT.
I don't think I've ever watched a film or series so intense, with so much suspense. I think it's the cleverest thing ever and each episode will leave you shocked. WATCH THIS MASTERPIECE AND YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.
And may I mention that in each season something crazy is going on and you do not lose the slightest interest. It's just perfect
PERFECT PERFECT PERFECT I won't mind admitting that this show successfully stick you to the screens of your devices. It's thrilling, every episode is bang on, hence perfect. Honestly...Once again extremely annoyed by negative reviews ...Why people feel the need to find logic in the entertainment...Looking for logic?Watch only Documentaries !!!Or sports,or music,don't judge action /thrillers negatively,just because of plot holes or whatever!!!If everything in films would be done according to real life logic.THERE WOULD BE NO ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY AND WE ALL DIED FROM BOREDOME WITHOUT MOVIES!!!
There are absolutely no TV series or ant other films,that can possibly follow the real life scenarios!!!Why??? Cause It would be very short and boring films!
Somebody holds up a bank,police arrives,shoots or arrest everybody-THE END!!!
So enjoy the art of cinematography for what it really gives you:some time to forget about miserable everyday life!And Money Heist is definitely one of the best shows in that regard! I am not saying anything bad but some people always have complaints when it doesn't belong from their country. And you can't change my mind. It reminds me a soap opera at first and a eeh ok sci-fi scene. But after some episodes it doesn't give me what i was expected and why sex? We're not at the game of thrones. You supposed to do a robbery and everyone failed. It's worse than the 8th season of game of thrones. Best series I ever watched, it's a MUST, you watch the whole series no stop! Bad acting it made me vomit also the fights are mire like an old Indian movie last but not least its gay I think this is the best possible action packed,thrilling show ever on Netflix....these guys really know how to pull it off🔥🔥i blown up,yo.....
Can't explain the feeling.... professor and the gang💥💥10 out ah 10... Great to have you p4e5. Finally another worthy and much anticipated support to the Professor. I've never posted a review before, but I must say I agree with the lowest ranking opinions. It's poor written and predictable, with zero charecter development.
I skipped from ep.3 to the last one and everything was as I expected. I still don't understand why the huge hype. I found this Spanish TV series by chance, I really recommend you watch it. It's one of the best series that I have seen lately. A chess game between the police and the robbers, you will be surprised by its development. You can not foresee anything. (I hope that my review is correct, I'm not a native speaker Every character a masterpiece
Each one,s character sketch perfect
I finished all 4 seasons in one go binging without being able to stop
Even though seasons 1 and 2 are the best seasons 3 and 4 did not let me down
I have a hangover of the show even a week after binge watching is over
The title song My life is going on and Bella Chow just enhance the beauty of this fantastic show
Proffesor, Tokyo , Denver ,Rio ,Monica Nairobi and all the charecters so beautifully written and acted out
I would give 100 stars on 5 from the inception ..writing to the final product
Hats off to full team
Cant wait for season 5
This is a must watch show according to me
At some point while watching Money Heist it stopped being just a show and became an emotion The tactics are extremly good, it has a powrful message, and it has an amazing structure!.
El profesor❤ Amazingly stunning, full of fun, thrill n Twists.. I love the show very much.. feel connected with many Characters Professor n his Team Rocks! Eagerly waiting for 5th season of this incredible TV series. Money heist or la casa de papel is one of the best series on Netflix. The story is brilliant and the characters are real, interesting people. Every season is impeccable flowing nicely together. Don't let the language barrier stop you, sit down, strap in and prepare to be hooked. I honestly cannot understand the insanity over this series. It is not even good-bad, to watch with friends and laugh at how horrible a show you are watching, it is simply bad-bad. The characters are all under-developed and keep making stupid decisions, the plot doesn't make sense, and the quality keeps dropping.
DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. Hear me out, this show is awful, very awful, even season 1 and 2. This show gets about 90% of the things wrong. I don't know why this show has such high ratings. Maybe it's meant for those 14yo edgy kids who haven't watched any good heist movies. People has that the characters in the show are unique and the best part about it. For me they were utterly annoying and the worst part. Except Berlin, none of the characters are tolerable at all. The police are so dumb and the professor makes some very dumb decisions. I even like the character of Arturo, I know he's hated but atleast he's not forgettable. Tokio and Río are the worst characters for me. I don't know how come people even like this soap opera filled with nothing but unnecessary melodrama. And people compare this show with Prison Break? Season 1 of Prison Break slaps all 4 seasons of this garbage by a milestone so stop comparing please. I request you to stop wasting your time in this show and watch something else. This is one of the most addictive season. Great characters and interesting story. I think it is one of the best web series ever. All the characters were did their best for making this masterpiece. Must watch web series Leyenda el professor<br/><br/>Bella ciao bella ciao bella ciao ciao ciao I LOVE IT.
THIS WAS AWESOME.
THE BEST TV SERIES I'VE SEEN EVER.
MUST WATCH!
FROM BANGLADESH ♥ It's a drama
Like me who are for some good thriller or heists things keep away from it Story telling is one of best part of this series. The director of this series doing great. As an movie and series lover I must say, this series is really awesome. In every season enjoy a lot. Wait for next season of this series. The Professor just mind blowing. Even, every corrector is really too good. Just love it. Brilliant idea, well made, good actors, you won't get sleep during these series, Thank you for such a good entertainment!! there always will be people who won't like masterpiece. Bravo! Berlin... oh what a character. What an amazing job from Pedro Alonso. His performance through all 4 seasons gave me goosebumps. S2 is not that bad, it only has emotion's and drama
S3 S4 are only for fan's but still watchable I spent the past few weeks watching this series and I absolutely fall in love with the storyline, it definitely managed to keep me wanting for more with each episode. I enjoyed getting to know all the characters throughout each scene, everyone has something that can connect with someone and that is what brought me closer to the show. A mixture of action, romance with a good laugh here and there, and not to mention the moments that made us cry. It really takes some serious thinking and planning to mix it all into a series that can makes us have empathy for those who break the rules and hate for those who protect us. I will not lie, at the end of episode 4... WTF??? You can't just leave a series unfinished, there are many questions open, you brought us the entire plot, we lived and breathed every episode, come on...there must be a conclusion to the end, and not just open the way you did. Tell us there is more to come. This has been a real treat! An amazing series, great acting, direction and such a suspenseful story it's really one of the very best I've seen ever. I love heist movies and I just found this one in Netflix and I literally couldn't stop watching through the night. The characters are simply amazing! Don't miss this. Great and Awesome, my no 1 favorite tv show, cant wait for season 5 The robbers who don't rob the bank for the printing machine, and the robber leader who dates the chief investigator. In order to perfect the perfect crime, the police find clues again and again and are solved by the "Professor". Psychological war, public opinion war, gunfight. It's very nice. I cant describe how good this is
From the start of season 1 to season 4 its simply amazing.
I dont have any words.
To all the people who didnt watch, i just want to say you something: Watch the first minutes of the first episode, you will become immediatly addicted.
I cant wait for part 5 and 6.
Thanks to all the team and actors behind this fantastic master piece. Just wanna thank all the cast.Actors,directors everyone. Thank you for making me feel this movie.This is absolute masterpiece from the beginning to the end.Its getting sad after some episodes because we saw that our loved characters are gone.And when you remember how they were dancing happy all together and now that we cant get that time back again its just breaking your hearts. You will not leave your seat till you watch the last episode. It's that good. Comfortably the best TV show on Netflix. Watch! You will fall in love with every City of the team. And enjoyably despise every one in the tent! Perfect show! But season 4 is not that much good..!!!! Bcoz we had lot of expectations after previous seasons!!! Love watching it enjoyed all the episodes 😍 keeps you excited what's coming next. In the first two seasons it was one of the best series I have ever seen, with a perfect number of episodes with an excellent plot that leaves you trapped and with exuberant emotions, until then it had perfect but Netflix turned the next two seasons into something empty and without direction or direction. If you ask in summary of the last two seasons it would be said in a few words and without feeling. After a long time I watched something which keep you tied up. You can go off the screen because in every second something is happening unpredictable. Must watch it. Love you all. I had no intensions of watching Money Heist whatsoever but gave a random try which turned out to be my best decision!
This series is a mixture of Action,Romance,Thrill,Mystery & Humor(Including dark humour).
It literally had me in the edge with a lot of spectacular jaw dropping scenes❤.
The creation of characters is so intricate & smart.
The theme song 'I don't care at all' & the show anthem 'Bella Ciao' are like icing on a cake,They're so catchy that you keep humming all along..
The characters are unique with different backgrounds who get together for the greatest heist in the history of mankind.
The show revolves around the heist & how it transforms their lives be it good or bad.
I hope you guy watch it because its 100% worth watching😍. How can i describe my feelings about this tv series.. Sorry i can't. It's perfect in so many ways, maybe there is plot hole may be not, i Don't care. What i care is acting of heist party. They are awesome I started watching late, just last night. Season 1 deserves 8.5 stars. Completes season one in one sitting. Today, at season 2 episode 8, already feeling like chewing hum.
Nice series, but folks, please, stop calling it a master-piece and stop comparing with Breaking Bad. When theres a Spanish series that the US loves, especially it being international, meaning Bollywood always getting positive reviews or anything out there that people are trying to support there content, well this proves how badly Money Heist should have stopped at 2 seasons. It would have been a master class series. Incredible. The showrunner could have created something else this whole time and leave my dying to see it. But...well La Casa de Papel is a unique tv show. It had a very good first season, the plot was original, the actors were incredible, it was action-packed and high-tension. Now with the fourth season, it's still good but not quite the same. A lot of plotholes that don't add up and 2 seasons left in a cliffhanger just to make you wait for yet another season to probably end up like that again. It's good, don't interpret me wrong, but it doesn't have the same quality as before. La casa de papel is one of the most entertaining tv shows i've watched In my life. Its not fiction but its not non fiction.It is believable but not really possible and that makes the tv show interesting. Its intense but it can get very slow too. Professor and his team has played a superb 👌 role in this entire series. Truly recommended series for them who is going to see reviews based series. The director of the film is a genius and best actors I love to watch, perfect entertainment and what a story with excellent actors I love them all I am in love this show. It is marvellous and P4E7 OMG! Just love it One of the best series in all formats, usually series like this can't bind people for long time because it's like same story in all series 'Heist'
BUT.....my friend this series is just different you will see robbers as Hero's.
Each character is just perfect what they are assigned to do.
The strategy, planning, the way professor explain everything it's execution all are just perfect.
Professor- A man with dream and principal
Tokyo- A girl who react on her instinct and just live the way she is
Berlin- best character in season 1 Don't start watching it unless u r off work the flowing day , I binge watched it non stop and went to work with my sleepy eyes Don't know !!
There is only one thing Interesting is First 2-3 Episode in Season 1 . After that they are doing what audience want . In one side Man called Professor ,He is mastermind in starting Episodes but he do lot of silly mistakes afterwards . There involved lot of money so Interesting so many people like at one point but there is no powerful logic , wtf Spain Intelligence doing in Show . Till I watched upto part ...No More . First of all I don't know why it is called Money Heist whereas La Casa De Papel means Paper House!! Anyways coming back to the series, It's not just a series it's a true ART with perfect cinematography,screenplay,background music,story and directing!! Every actor did their parts flawlessly and you have to focus each and every second so attentively because every scene has meaning and connected to back when planning was done with the present scenario where robbery is happening!! You will be hooked each and every second of it trust me!! 1st part and 2nd part was awesome, i have never seen like this and the professor is just awesome but after 3rd part its just nice but lacks. Overall great series, recommending to all. Everything about the series is very thoroughly planned and thought-through. It keeps you on your toes, guessing, and engaged. Excellent character development. Very layered plot. Sends very clear message. Great writing (with what I can understand thought the subtitles). There's drama, romance, action, and some comedy. Plus, my brainy friends, you will be pleased with the game they brought to the table.<br/><br/>Everyone I recommended this to ended up binge watching it. Great series but not quite realistic. Professor character was the best thing about this show his tactics and ideas are almost equal to Michael scofiled from prison break. Intelligent yet little bit flawed. This show is emotional, intelligent and best Spanish series of all time. I just love and support their point of view."just wow" the every seconds from the first episode of season 1 to the last episode of season 3.#bela_chao Seasons 1 and 2 are one of the best TV series of the least years. Pity, though, they decided to do season 3.
As it often happens in successful TV series, the story goes on an on, even though it makes no sense. Screenplays are poor, as sadly happens in Money Heist season 3.
What a shame having spoiled a great story. Watched it for 3 times.
Can any one suggest me other series like this one. I loved it. Amazing planning and direction .
what a great role played by each individual characters and I like it too much. Berlin's role was awesome. Must watch series. My first review of a tv series, yet alone European series. Honestly I have to say I rather enjoyed the first two seasons and have listed all the pros and cons below:<br/><br/>Pros: The series are well paced and they lead into each following episode nicely. Great acting particularly from the characters Berlin and the Professor. Great score and limited CGI is rather effective. Locations on all sets (filmed in Spain) are wonderful.<br/><br/>Cons: Too many chiefs and not enough Indians, basically there are so many changes and shifts in both the bank robbing group and Spanish Police it's laughable. The two main police/detective characters are the biggest imbeciles you could possibly witness. The firearm/weapon action scenes throughout the series are so over the top and unbelievable it personally prevents me from giving this a 9/10. Honestly Tokio/Tokyo (main character) manages to hit targets with her back turned, running backwards and single handed. The show would have been fantastic if they hired a firearms advisor.<br/><br/>All in all I would suggest giving this series a go if you have a few hours to kill. The characters Arturo and Angel are so pathetic it's honestly fascinating to watch them spiral out of control. After watching the part 1-2 i thought part 3 will be boring. But surprisingly part 3 is just game changing superb. I just loved it. Hope part 4 is coming soon. Waiting for it... This show feels like theatre, packaged.
I think the bad reviews give it the thumbs down because they're expecting a more modern/moderate approach to cinema.
I agree, plenty things are pretty dramatic, exaggerated (in terms of emotional reactions), and the characters along with the plot follow a "normal" fairly formulaic, arguably predictable, story arc.
...but I love that the characters are named semi-anonymously because doing so objectifies them by labeling and strips people off the complexity of our humanity. Having said that, this show exposes itself of the flaws of having one-dimensional characters by using its own characters interact with one another and get to know them deeper than the roles they have, in the given context while still in the act.
The pacing of the acting along with the editing, too, is astounding. The actors act with their eyes, own their respective characters' personalities while showing that they act differently around various scenarios and people.
Many decades ago, fast cutting in editing was frowned upon although many avant-garde filmmakers were already using it (mainstream tends to be behind with these things). It wasn't until later that it became common although I find that too many productions overuse it (montage sequences, which aren't all that bad, which isn't very often)... but when you give it just slivers within the right moments to depict an emotional and mental state of the characters in given stressful or ecstatic moments? Brilliant.
It also mixes the old (folk European music sang by the robbers when they were rejoicing about finding soil) and the new (technology, costumes & wardrobe, shot in present time), politics and how scandals/heists come into play with diplomacy...
I can go on and on about how much I love it both for the eye candy and the socially charged messages (meat) but I think you should go check it out yourself and see if you agree or disagree =) Many tv series I've watched and never found like this one since the famous one "24" or "bodyguard" or "shooter". This one has came up with a new idea of how a brilliant and a well-structure planned of bank robbery is succeed. In the end show of each episodes, I am truly amazed of how it linked between each episodes and unexpected story of how the situation of the robbers ends in glory. Indeed, what is the most impressive one is that the bad sides (the robbers) always step one ahead from good sides (the police).<br/><br/>Lastly, anyone who has spare time: please, download this series and watch it continuously! you won't regret seeing this 10/10 rating series and excellent plot stories. When I realised it was a Spanish series dubbed into English I almost switched off. What a mistake I would have made. It's a gripping storey very cleverly told. Fascinating! I never thought that this show is that good. What made it a good experience for me was a few different reasons:
1. The pacing of the series: It is the first time that I watch a show were 5 days take place in only 19 episodes. There were some episodes were we get to live only an hour or two in the world of our characters. There is no single scene that has no use or convenience to the plot, also not a single boring one. Each conversation or incident happens for a reason that develops the characters or for us to learn things about the world of La Casa de Papel or the characters.<br/><br/>2. The realism of the human nature: Our characters are not perfect. The writers use that lack of perfection in favor of the development of the characters. Police members not being perfect. Gang members not being devils and 100% bad.<br/><br/>
I really liked this show. I'll give it 8/10. However, there are some aspects that kind of ruined it for me, especially at the end of season 2. For example: some characters being too smart - sometimes unrealistically - and other that should be smart are behaving very very naively that it was not convenient to me. I truly love this series. It's a cross between Ocean's Eleven and The Magnificent Seven with so many subtle messages of the common people against the establishment. This show keeps everyone on the edge of the seats. Sometimes it's become really cliches but overall an amazing show. The bgm is freaking amazing, one would instantly fall in love with it. One of the best series I have ever watched. The great story plot and the great presentation. I just loved it. Favorite character Nairobi Berlin professor Tokyo Excellent show, very interesting scenery. Everything is Fantastic. Cant wait for the season 4 !!!<br/><br/>Could someone tell me when is expected to release the season 4?<br/><br/>PS
You're the best A true masterpiece. Everything about this series is great !! Wow Wow what can I say about this creativity ... Now we can say that Season 3 is the strongest and most beautiful season in the series We need season four, the concept of this series is awesome and it executed so well. I was always standing on my feet at the end of each episode. One of the best serious far better than many other TV series. Professor gave justice to his role. What a legend. You'll get addicted to the show.<br/><br/>
It's unpredictable, it's suspenseful, it's twisted, it's AMAZING!<br/><br/>screenplay is brilliant. overall is great. love this season. Nothing bad to say about a masterpiece.The most suspenseful series i have seen in my life , it's truly mind blowing to me how hard was to predict what was going to happen.An amazing experience that you can't miss out even more if you got bored of the hollywood type writing. Very entertaining and exciting. Great characters, great acting and superb, action-driven plot. Even the dubbing is fantastic, it is so well done that arter a minute or two you forget it is not an English-language show. Hollywood no longer hokds supremacy in top thrillers.
Excelente piece of work!!
Though 8 chapters of series seem a bit short.
Hope they don't wait that long for Another season I enjoyed watching GOT but it wasn't this great at the end! I mean I literally couldn't take my mind off this show! the action, the heist, the crew the roll it was thrilling breath taking!👏😍 Can't wait for part 4
You must see this show right now! I love it!! Especially season/part 3, I always want to watch more because it always has you at the edge of your seat. It's really a masterpiece!! I recommend everyone to watch it!!!!!!!! Everything is so well synchronized, direction, scenario. Once.you start watching you cant stop. The best of the best I have ever watched so far.<br/><br/>Bring us season 4,5,6,7 nowww!!! We Mediterraneans have a tendency to live the moment, plan less, act unorganized, and try to save the day first. The scriptwriters of this show exibits all of these attributes of an average Mediterranean. Obviously they have worked on the first two episodes in depth, and went on to sip their Sangrias. The public interest the show has received must have been a huge shock and they were obviously totally unplanned, since I can find no other explanation for the shameful comedy show that it evolves afterwards.<br/><br/>The perfect plan for robbery that the show is based on quickly evolves into a series of random acts, mainly based on continuous overhearing of some dialogues by others (Very typical in Mediterranean - Latin American shows) and our bunch of stupid robbers can not manage to keep their sexual desires under control for a couple of days. I could not count how many times there were effectively ZERO robbers guarding the captives, while they were having a meeting, fighting with each other or having sex somewhere. And the ultimate point, Tokyo's return to the Mint... words are not enough to describe the level of stupidity of that scene.<br/><br/>As I mentioned at the title, after a point I could not stop laughing while watching. Still, I finished the show, but will definitely not watch the new season. One of my favorites. It's a must watch
I have watched this series more then once One of the best TV-series I've ever watched. So well thought out and just completely amazing. Left me with a feeling of happiness and curiosity. I want to know what happened after everything! I'm astounded by the creativity, truly a work of art! This is the first time I'm writing a review here because with all the buildup and the character development that was done throughout the show the ending pissed me off so much. Everything in the show was mastered to perfection with very little plotholes and the ending was good as well but I kinda expected it from the start. With the way the show was progressing, I expected much more from the finale. But overall a great watch a d would definitely recommend it!! THE BEST!
Its a materpiece. Loved all the characters. Wish it never ended. But sadly it had to end. I simply don't know how some adults don't understand that a movie it's a movie....expecting facts 100% like in real life...wow... I have become a great fan of the show creators and actors this is the best deserves whatever award that is available in this planet. Fantastic.Too much suspens. Brilliant acting from every actor in this series.One of the best tv series so far.😍 I usually don't review any movie or series, but this is one of the series which made me binge watch, and at last the gave the feel of satisfaction of watching an amazing series, I would recommend it to everyone!
A great story, great direction, on point, there might be a few loopholes, but who cares! It's just fabulous This is one of the best shows i've watched for a while. The storyline is very well written, very exciting. Also the acting is great. Just watch it! One of the most amazing series of the last years. Everything begins with "the professor" and everything ends with him. Every character is unique ,intersting plot every episode just amazing. The first impression is that the serie is about a robbery but la casa de papel is more than that, you will feel it from the first minutes. I don't usually write reviews but some of the reviews here made my blood boil. What is it with these people ? Is it a case of rivals who are jealous of the success of the show ?<br/><br/>Every negative review says holes in the plot but they don't say what it is lol..<br/><br/>Anyways, the plot is genius. If you like the Hollywood movies like ocean 13 etc, this is on a different level altogether. The acting is good, the screenplay is super, the way each knot is untied is great, soundtrack excellent. Romance between the 2 main characters is totally engrossing. I mean someone actually came up with that while the heist is ongoing ? 10 for that itself.<br/><br/>The haters can hate all they want, but this show is phenomenal. Huge rating with that many reviews is a proof. Great idea but guess what! Already on 2008 movie Inside man!!
The fake tunnel and so on....
but actors are great.
Good copycat, obviously the flaws come with the new story the writers of inside man did watch less action movies and more mind games... A great tv show for every one who likes Drame and Action Very tight script, little fluff. Original idea. Great ensemble of characters/actors. I'll admit this show took a minute to get me really invested at first, but by the end, I was really attached to the characters and loved all of them (even Berlin). The actors are all amazing and the script was incredibly written. This show is unique and constantly keeps you on the edge of your seat with the "plot twists" and whatnot. I promise you won't be sorry if you decide to watch! Once you start viewing it you cannot stop watching- Good storylines. Well directed . Good soundtrack , good brain plain from leader and well waiting for s3 really good :) A must watch if you're in an adventure for a Lifetime, if it would be possible I would rate it 20/10 ,it's that Great, One of the Best Series I've seen in a Long Time Everything covered. Season is fire. Outstanding, fantastic, fabulous, everything. A smart script can only get the action so far as to be a good maybe two hour movie, but they tried to fill a two part multi-episode series and that didn't go well with the details. Almost all of the professor's scenarios are beyond believable and many details are truly outrageous.<br/><br/>Would have been a good movie but it is not only a mediocre series that is simply taking too much of your time. This show is just amazing. The star cast , the story, the background music everything is just perfect. You won't see a better edge of the seat thriller than this. It's even better than prison break. Twists and turns. Action and drama. Love and be loved. Hate, and still be loved. This story has almost everything. OK, a few unrealistic moments. I mean - how many rounds does a magazine really hold? And how bad are trained snipers at hitting a target? That, and a few unlikely turn of events (which I will not spoil for you) aside - this is a magnificent story, accompanied by brilliant acting! Please give me more of this! Superb mystery... Mystery unsolved 😎
Each and every charter unique and surprised each Evey episode.... A pure thriller.. felt like I was a part of the heist 🤣🤣 a must watch .
. I'm speechless I mean this app has everything 😍💕 One of the finest piece of art. Cinematography , plot , acting all were amazing. One of the best series ever containing action scenes and lots of philosophy quotes being said, I fully recommend you all to watch this masterpiece at least 2 times To say that first: It is an okay series with good tension towards the end. If you like simple action series you're right. <br/><br/>But - and there are so many buts: 
1) It is wayyy too long. You could've told the story in one season that they've told in two. <br/><br/>2) It has way too many plot holes, unrealistic developments as well as unrealistic single scenes - the leading officers seem to be the slowest and most short-thinking people on the planet. I don't want to spoil any so I'll leave it with that.<br/><br/>3) the English syncs are so bad it hurts. Starting with the fact that they call the guy "Angel" instead of "Àngel". The leading officers sound like post-pubertarian kids instead of grown-up inspectors in charge of the biggest heist in Spanish history. <br/><br/>I'm pretty pissed I wasted that much of my time. But - and that's maybe the only thing I have to admit that's good about it - I had to finish to at least know the end. I dont want to give info about the series.. 
I suggest you 100% to watch this series.. just do it. An AMAZING series ! I liked it alot , wish it was more the 2 seasons Top ! More "European" : That's why it was the most-watched non-English language series ever on Netflix's streaming service ! So much obsession with this season. Oh my God. What a detailed heist planning written from being till end. I loved the acting of Mr. Berlin. Outstanding. Oh god, why this TV series doesn't have 50 more episodes ?. 
What a masterpiece. Not the genius script, but it looks like each actor in the group somehow gave its' Oscar winning performance. The director is genius to get out of this group such brilliant performance. What a combination of Drama-Action-Philosophy-Comedy all mixed into a script and flow that takes your breathe away. 
Brilliant Cinematography !, oh man, Nairobi checking the quality of the 100 Euros through the magnifying glass with her big eyes, what a brilliant shot. 
The twists and turns in each episode is simply a work of excellence. 
I truly give this TV series the chance to be the absolute BEST work ever exposed on the TV screen. Kudos !, Kudos, Bravo ! The premise is good, the execution of some scenes and some plot devices is good. The rest is pretty much bad or mediocre.<br/><br/>All loves stories are either unbelievable, corny, dragged for too long or a mix of those. Most decisions made by all characters make no sense, except Berlin and not even.<br/><br/>The last episodes are unnnecessarily revolving around the same things, the last 6 episodes could have been 2 and that would have been much better.<br/><br/>All characters are awful, except Berlin, the cop female lead and the professor, which are okay, definitely not well rounded and quite plain anyway but at least interesting.<br/><br/>Specially Tokyo is awful, bad actress, uninteresting, and her narration voice is terrible, not as much because of the way she forces her vocalisation to seem dramatic, which she does, but because 80% of the things narrated would be better left silent.<br/><br/>All in all, entertaining, and worth watching, but at the same time very badly written and with lots of up and downs in execution. The plot twists throughout the show are really good because you may expect them but not in the way they happen. There are some characters like Tokio or Denver who can be really frustrating as their only focus are their love interests and that clouds their judgement and actions, especially Tokio's, to the point where it seems that she just doesn't care about anything else. Actions are too influenced by irrational feelings and that's why Berlin is one of my favorite characters because he's able to follow the plan and doesn't mess up too often or for stupid reasons. Nairobi is another favorite as she sticks to the plan, is tough when needed and is able to keep the gang together. The professor is incredible, even though his love affair with the inspector is a mess. The show really keeps you excited for what's going to happen next and it has great hidden messages and morals. La Casa de Papel is a nice show if you compare it to other very meh shows around right now!!
Cons: too much feelings and romance for a criminal show, hence characters behaving like amateurs sometimes.
Pros: lots of action, clever plot twists and well designed characters. OMG I am about to finish part 2 and my heart is beating so fast (this is why I am here to try to multitask and relax a bit, lol)! What a treat this has been, I switched from Spanish to English audio which I think it is a PLUS to have this option.
I am already searching for its continuation, the part 3 (btw, does it mean season 3, in other series they call it season 1, 2 and so on)?
Enjoy this series, I think it is awfully clever and I am one of those who love to see them go free and laugh all the way to the bank (oops, no need to go to a bank anymore). I love the cast, more power to you guys and I can't wait to see more seasons and episodes!! Wow! It was such a journey for me. I have been wanting to watch this since the very first trailer came out, but life got in the way and it has to be put off for later. I deeply appreciate that since now I have two seasons and it kept me bingeing all the way to the end. I loved how this is a well thought-out plan and how there are love stories all around. It wasn't too much that it became soapy, but just enough to keep you cheering for the characters. It was so well portrayed that-just like what the Professor wanted them to be-I felt they were real heroes and I really do wish everything ends well for all of them. A part of me hoped they would continue to the running out of the country part and what happen next in all of their lives, but another part can't help but want to leave it all like that so it would never really end. I just thank God and everyone involved that gave us this. It has been an emotional ride, an unforgettable one. At first i thought it was another tv show being overrated and it was all about the hype. How wrong i was. At the very first when the Profesor told they were going to enter the Royal Mint, it hit me and then how they were going to be the good guys, robbing no one and becoming the voice of the resistance is totally a masterpiece and creative in an unique way. Loved how they connect with the "Ciao Bella", even though many people missed it and are overusing it as just another song and forgetting the message and the history under it. How in each episode everything seems to get worse and then realising it was all planned it left me with my mouth open. And Berlin. The perfect acting and character who sacrificed himself at the end and giving an answer to anyone who thought he was a psychopath. For the first time in my life i feel completed after ending a tv series and not asking myself what i'm going to watch now. And also the use of color red, grey and black, the music on different dramatic scences is a strong point to love it. "É questo fiore del partigiano morto per la liberta." Definetly 12/10 It is an amazing show! I enjoyed every second of it. La casa di papel is the best series i have ever watched and i think it's the best series in the tv history in the world Greece love la casa de papel!Eyxaristoume! After game of thrones my favorite is this one First of all, I think this is my first review (so please be nice!) but I felt it necessary cause when I was watching the show I took a glimpse at this page and saw an average 8,7 rating, which left me a bit surprised, especially when some other movies or series here are receiving very short ratings. <br/><br/>Well, as I'm saying in the title, this isn't a bad tv show. I enjoyed it and I watched it in 3 days, but I'd give this not more than a 6,5 or 7 stars rating.<br/><br/>The plot (some guys trying to rob the spanish royal mint) is good and haunts you in the first episodes, of course it's a tv series so it doesn't have to be totally realistic and in the first part, as I said, the whole thing works well. The acting is ok and so is the script.
But at a certain point the characters become so dumb that you can't really believe it's a serious script. I won't spoiler anything but they start making choices that no-one would ever make in any situation, and I tend to consider Bank Robbing as a quite dangerous one.
I'm well aware of what the "suspension of disbelief" is and I'm totally convinced of its importance while watching or reading fictional products, but here they go a little bit further.<br/><br/>But, most important in my not-so-good review is: I strongly hated most of the characters, they're unbearable, they're stupid, they make you want to kill them every time they open their mouths. And if you are rational human beings you'll probably hate them too.<br/><br/>By the way, if you just want to relax watching something intriguing without having heavy mental efforts, then go on. :) One of the best shows I have ever seen; great acting, unbelievable writing, very single aspect of this serie is truly amazing; the first episodes are a little slow, but throughout the rest of the episodes you find yourself involved in the great suspense and you just can't stop watching. Truly, a master piece. Don't expect any realism or characters acting like they are real human beings, hostages and police officers. So many plotholes. Its unbelievable. The writers didnt spend enough time with the script and with logic.<br/><br/>So many things just happen for entertainment's sake. It makes me angry and want to shut it off, but....<br/><br/>The story and idea is indeed amazing and Im curious how everything will turn out. <br/><br/>It could have been one of the best shows I watched this year. Its cool and entertaining if you accept the flaws and missing logic!<br/><br/>2nd season really starts with the most annoying episodes Ive ever watched in a series!<br/><br/>Hope it will get better! Without the awfull Tokyo role could have been a 7. Story not the strongest part. Ok actors nice setting looks great. There are so many false dramatic moments because there's not enough to keep a person interested. It's probably the most unrealistic show i've seen in my entire life. From the fact that the police can't aim at all, to the fact that these amateurs can take on dozens of armed police and somehow come out on top each time (and never reload) and rarely get hit by the thousands of bullets shot at them. The police on this show are the single worst shots in history and apparently don't own flash bangs. It's also fascinating to see how a skinny 100 pound girl shoots rifles on full auto, one handed. This show is a cartoon.<br/><br/>I can't stand how there are so many pointless "dramatic" moments. For example, two of the robbers will say something to each other and then agree "Let's do it!" and then rush down the hall and slam open the door where the hostages are, yell loudly and rack their assault rifles and point it at the hostages...and then walk out with a flat screen TV. At other times, they'll walk into the room with the hostages real relaxed with their hands in their pockets and joke with them.<br/><br/>Every episode has at least 10 ridiculous scenes with moronic scenarios or terrible acting. The only reason I can imagine this show has a high rating is because I realize that most shows produced outside the US and UK are horrible. So maybe this is actually a good drama by Spanish standards? It has an 8.7 IMDB rating for that reason. Applying US standards, i'd say this show is closer to a 4.5 Completly amateur ... hollywood corny style ... side stories that as nothing to do with the main story 
2 or 3 first episodes are ok (or not ...:D )<br/><br/>congratulations to Berlim ... the best character in the show !!<br/><br/>If you want good shows watch "The americans" The scenario were pretty much cleaver but the result was totally disaster.. A lot of gaps on the plot, so many unbelievable acts, boring dialogues.. It's a mixture of drama, comedy, action I don't know what exactly, but still was a waste of time A bunch of undisciplined amateurs plan an 'Ocean's Eleven' style heist at The Spanish Mint. It all goes terribly awry because they ... well, behave like amateurs. It's well paced and makes for some good entertainment, but I'm not buying the underlying premise of this ragtag bunch somehow being capable of planning the heist of the century. It reminds me of the sci-fi movie Sunshine (2007) where a bunch of our 'finest' astronauts mess up their mission to save the earth. Fascinating! You can't stop watching. Really intriguing! Great story! It is simply one of the best TV shows I've watched on Netflix! 
There are a lot of people complaining that this movie is overrated, but I wanna ask you, which one is overrated: Money heist or The Black Panther? Season 2 can even be better then T1!!
Tremendous Hollywood improved TV Series!!
Amazing Eight stars for Season One, which was a nice, taut heist series with interesting twists and characters. One star for Season Two...a bridge way too far. A well done cops and robbers caper turned into a superficial Robin Hood Oceans 11mash-up. A worthy theme of female empowerment turned into insulting women stupid in love. A page-turner turned into an excruciating series of farcical plot twists and character reversals all in service of filling out a second season of unnecessary and unbelievable drama. Like a Thanksgiving dinner...the first serving is delicious and satisfying; the second full of regret and shame. The first season starts out really great and a little more than half the season keeps it going, but then it starts to deteriorate.<br/><br/>Everyone in the series makes really stupid choices all the time and some of the things are just unbelievable. The SWAT police are really lousy shots, as well.<br/><br/>The ending isn't really up to par either.<br/><br/>How could the police miss the truck leaving the garage and did the police just drop the investigation in the end, not following up on the leads or watching video, etc, etc..? How they got away and what happened to everyone else is not mentioned. Ridiculous ending. I fell in love with this show. The acting, the casting, the sets, the passion, the message, everything was perfect. One of my favorite shows ever. La mejora serie los últimos años! Me encanta esta serie ! Es muy original! Vale la pena Drama, comedy, thriller, action, romance. All in 1 series, straight forward story, no useless episodes, keeps you sticked to the screen all along the 2 seasons. I wish they do an 3rd season. This series gave me the same kind of KICK that Narcos gave...except for some dragging movements which can be skipped. Few parts were boring like the planning of hostages to escape which can be avoided by fast forwarding. But overall a Good Series. One more series which helps us to understand how the Economy is Paper Thin. Good action, heart stopping moments, very nice acting. Pretty good overall!
 Gave it an 8 cause I hated Denver's laugh and the scene where the police couldn't stop Tokyo from getting back into the museum was a little unreal.
 Hype, but unreal. I couldnt stop watching this serie, i was 24/7 watching it.<br/><br/>The only thing i didnt like is the end, they only let see how the proffesor live after everything but i wanted to see the how the othe rprotagonists are living after steal the bank I don't know if my impatience toward tv series in general will affect my review but I guess it will. Usually I don't like tv shows that are long especially when focused on one or few ideas and place! Like this show! The idea is nice and what they are trying to convey to the audience is interesting. But they keep repeating the same tactic like the thieves "revolutionists" are always a step ahead of the police when you think that they screwed up but you find that the professor thought of it too :O which became really stupid sometimes. Illogical. Some scenes and events are really silly and nonsense. Some characters are needles and some were really stupid like the big 2 guys. However, the show has some really amazing scenes. Would I recommend the show? Yes I would as a non-professional tv series with a catchy idea and an ending the audience will like, maybe love as I did! At least it's not too long hehe First i decide to not watch it 
But whene ypu watch more you will never leave it 
I like it I think the titles are wrong cuz its a romance, drama serie... there is no action or anything its full of drama and im really bored cuz of this... One of my top series for 2017-18. Just waiting for season 2! And I do watch many! Too many perhaps...<br/><br/>Just wait for the murricans to come, like they did with Män som hatar kvinnor for example...<br/><br/>Just watch it! It's not that good................................. One of the best series I have seen. It is un-imaginable that a single heist-based series can be of this level and a plot this impregnable. The narrative is fantastic with often going back and coming forth in timeline. All the characters are delved deep into creating an overall impact to the whole story. 
The plot has enough twists to keep you hooked from the first minute of the show. All the actors have played their roles with equal elan. 
Must Watch !! The best series I've seen in the last 3 years. It is the best combination of drama, action and humor that I have seen in a series. From the first glance it looks like a typical European TV show and to be honest I don't usually watch this genre however, the twists and story progression is really good. I gave it a 10/10 because it was good enough to attract someone who doesn't watch this specific genre of TV shows. The voice acting is not 10/10 but the show itself compensated for the lack of a good dubbed voice acting. I'm sure it's great but........they're speaking in Spanish and it's voiced over in English. I can't watch this. I thoroughly enjoyed the first season currently out, and while I generally felt satisfied with the events of the plot, there are certain points where it felt the plot got into a corner and the writers just added flashbacks in order to say that the mastermind accounted for everything. It's convincing in the way his character is portrayed, but laughable at some points. Also the closing line of the first episode almost made me not want to watch the series due to how cringy it is. Don't be dissuaded, this is a very well written story showing perspectives of the hostages and how they view events even though the audience knows differently. They don't keep the audience in the blind and allow the audience to truly feel a step ahead of the police along with the gang. I would definitely recommend watching at least the season that is currently available. Absolutely loving this. It's exciting and intriguing with more twists and turns than you could shake a stick at. Production values are first class but most crucial for me in any good fiction, it's character led and there's a wee smattering of well timed comedy in there to lighten the load. Can't recommend it highly enough. I really enjoyed this drama because it keeps its story line throughout the entire series and keeps the character development too. This drama focuses on every person and and I really enjoy how the story develops, with a reasonable amount of tension and suspense to keep you hooked.<br/><br/>The characters are played really well by the actors and actresses because i really ended up hating Arturito haha.<br/><br/>Its a tense show so be ready XD Great series and 4th season is above all the best! This show is a non-stop roller coaster. I see a lot of negative reviews, however 'Money Heist' delivers time after time. The pacing is impeccable, each part of the story leading into another in a way that keeps you wanting more. The plot is thoroughly concise and is very satisfying to see unfold. As an English viewer; I find it utterly refreshing to see some great dramas from the continent. I found 'Money Heist' consistently addictive and always wanted more Amazing acting. The TV series was made so well thought out. All of the actors were fantastic. Keeps you totally intrigued. Something else ! Loved it ! This is the best Non English webseries ever I've watched
You'll fall for Professor's role for sure
Nairobi is Love Great show and easy to follow
Lot of foreshadowing if you focus enough This show is one of a kind, it shows how not following the rules can lead to the plan being very different, but some stuff do not quite make sense, like when Tokyo kisses Alisson. Unique show. Love it. But the problem is, the robbers can't make this better however they have a mastermind professor. Always they made mistakes and unnecessary violence in themselve (looks like they don't know each other for a while), every time the just put the robbery in danger, they can't work together like a team. which is really awful from netflix. I like this kind of high intelligence crime, but the logical end result should be that robbers have been disintegrated one by one, professors' indecision has also killed themselves, and the later resources and information of robbers are far less than that of police. The arrangement is refreshing and has a very stable rhythm. Although many unimportant plots have been inserted for the needs of the series, it does not damage the whole. The real human nature promotes the trend, which is both lamentable and regrettable. Totally worth it ! I suggest to see it, acting, writing and the plot is fantastic Just saw it . And my god I loved it so much . Amazing series . Amazing concept and brilliant acting .every scene was worth watching. Can't describe more . Though season 4 seems a bit slow . But it holds and grips you through the story and it continues to entertain you . Will I recommend this. Yes I will absolutely recommend this. Now eagerly waiting for season 5 . If you haven't watched it. Go and watch it guy . As I always say don't believe the reviews. Go and watch by yourself. Don't even read my review . See and then say .its a masterpiece I have to start off by saying that I don't understand the bad reviews for the fourth part. Sure, there were some questionable scenes, but nothing that the other seasons did better, in my opinion. The fourth part is really intense in his own way and sets itself apart from the rest of the seasons without taking away from the original concept and visualization of the show. I enjoyed watching every part and I hope it continues soon. If you are looking for a series that gives you feeling of thrill,action,suspense,romance,crime etc then you have chosen the right series.
Starting from Unknown people to becoming the loved ones of the public and to each other,the journey was wonderful and connecting. The Heist didn't felt any boring or unrealistic. I mean the concept of whole is worth watching and the actors have added more stars and a full moon to it.
The master mind Direction to the well scripted writing everything was planned and phenomenal.
I must suggest you to watch this series and after that you will be more attentive and observatory in life. This series not only entertains us but also give us so many messages and lesson that are so helpful in real life.
Go for it.
Although i am waiting for Season 5 to arrive very eagerly.
Love from INDIA.
Bella Ciao Bella Ciao! Once in a while Netflix gets it right, I was putting off watching this show for quite abit, because it didn't looking appealing but and when I finally started gaddamnit I couldn't get enough. Give it a try you will not regret it. ðŸ˜‰ Superb!!!Very well made show.Acting is just absolutely amazing!!!
Some plot holes and illogical things do not prevent it to be one of the best tv shows ever made! Part 1: Excellent
Part 2: Outstanding
Part 3: Average
Part 4: Magnificent.<br/><br/>Season 4 of 'La Casa De Papel' (aka 'Money Heist') Goes Bigger, Louder, and Even More Melodramatic. ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ Its one of the best series in the world if you want something shocking then just go for it I understand the people who like to bring everything down. It is in their nature. All those negative comments for season 3 and 4 is just a reaction. But honesty, seasons 3 and 4 are brilliant in their own way. Are they the same as 1 and 2 ? Of course not and anyone who compares might as well compare oranges and apples. Seasons 3 and 4 deliver something different and just as amazing and emotionally strong. Nuanced relationships between characters. A heist that is not as well thought as the first one and is therefore much more "imprevisible". A well executed scenario, amazing performances and beautifully directed scenes. The producers of this show are not doing this for the money or fame (yet): they are doing it for us. I'll be the first to call them out when they get greedy. But it is not yet. And I can't wait for season 5. Season 3 and 4 are just phenomenal. The last two episodes of season 4 are gripping and intense! Professor never disappoints us! How i wish there is morethan 10stars for me to rate this movie. This is definitely the all time best. If you watch one episode.. Without your conscience you'll tend to go marathon mode..!! Bella ciao Bella ciao...!! Money Heist is not a story of heist only but it connects you to all the grounds of your life. Alex Pina you are a great writer with a great intellectual power. The characters and the story in which we will see everything drama, action, adventure, romance, thriller, mystery..... and many many more things. Money Heist is my all time favourite TV Show and I am very grateful to Alex sir who created such a premium class TV show for us Money Heist is one of the best series I have ever seen in my entire life. It is so good that it made me write the title of this review in Spanish as a gratitude for creating such a spectacular series for us.<br/><br/>A very special gratitude to the director & story writer for having such brains to create such a series. Its actually a chess game experience when you watch the series with Professor playing his turn against whole government and the police and Intelligence and what not AND beating them every single time.<br/><br/>Also each and every character has done their best and I have become a big fan of whole crew.<br/><br/>I would really recommend this series to each and every person to please watch it and not miss it for the world. It really is a fine piece of art which no one should miss. Best part is it keeps getting better & better every episode and every season beats the previous one.<br/><br/>Really hope for the series to not end and eagerly waiting for next season.<br/><br/>Impresionante trabajo chicos !!! Felicitaciones !!! This show is amazing. didn't think it was possible for a series to be as intense and as touching as this one. there are so many unexpected plot twists and each episode always brings the viewers to the edge of their seats. Amazing Tv show,full of tense and emotions.Simply the great This Tv Show is really cool. The first Spanish TV Show that really got me! Applause, good work. The twisting of allegiance between good and bad is complicated by not knowing who is good or bad. I hope the open ending means there is more to come and I like the direction of the social/political confusion. Masterpiece of tension and release, goosebumps, heartbreak, grandiosity and intimacy!!! Fascinating development of the key characters. Fantastic script with superb acting. This is one of the best series I've ever seen. So intriguing so I couldn't stop watch it 😅
Good acting from everyone involved, wonderful characters. The more episodes you watch, the more you'll love the characters. And it has hilarious moments. A series in my taste 👌🏼 I looked at the first two seasons in one breath! I started to watch the third one and didn't even understand what they did! The film was shot just monstrously! Everything is tightened! They play badly! Dialogues are uninteresting, all artificial, including emotions. I quit watching 4 episodes. Yes without doubt this tv-show is the best tv-show or movie I ever seen in my life this is a masterpiece for more simplicity I have never felt all these different feelings since I watched another masterpiece movie "The Godfather". this tv-show not just about the smartest silly heist like "Ocean's" which everything happened good and smoothly without errors. the main idea for "The Godfather" and "La Casa de Papel" to me is there isn't a pure good or a pure evil but all of humans are good and all of us are bad as an equation changes everyday
Without no doubt I recommend this tv-show if you need to watch a show has more than firing, yelling or silly heist this show is for you I got hooked up from the first ten minutes. The series I think in the best one I've ever seen and I'm a big fan of TV shows. From the cast, directing, storyline, even to soundtracks, everything is perfect. The mind games are incredible. This show is 10/10 for me. I Can't wait for what's gonna happen next.
So recommend 😍 Amazing unwrapping of the story, keeps you on your toes I've stayed with this series through till the 2nd series. It's potentially a good storyline thats been squandered by a poor script and some seriously amateur acting. If you watch in English and the sub titles are on, you can have a good laugh as they are truly terrible. However, thus far, episode 6, it is an interesting and clever watch. I am sure there will be more thrills and twists It's absolutely mind-blowing,outstanding,overwhelming tv series I've ever watched 🖤 Not into robbery movies but this one is BLAST !!!<br/><br/>Love from Pakistan ;-) I love the whole cast, the story, the acting, simply everything. It's exciting, heartwarming, funny, sad,... u feel everything xD<br/><br/>It's really a must see tv series! This tv series Deserves an oscar. Best narration best directing best Cinematography best story. It's full of empathy, aggressiveness, intense. I never get bored while watching this series amazing. Part 4 Quickly please
Parte 4 Rápidamente por favor I stumbled upon this masterpiece on Netflix. Could very well be the best show I have ever seen or at least in the top 3. I'm talking about something as good as shows like "breaking bad" for example. I just finished the last episode of season 3 and it left me in awe. I can't wait for season 4. Start watching it today, you won't regret it and you will thank me for the recommendation. I usually don't review TV shows, because they change during the course, but this show really worth breaking my own principles.<br/><br/>Note: Review is only first 3 seasons<br/><br/>The show first surprised me from the fact that whole seasons are based on one heist. I lost faith in this series quite a few times, because I was coming with listening so much hype. But this show always gained the faith back.<br/><br/>Like, the way it started, it was clear, that The Professor was way way ahead of Police and even it looks likes he's slipping, he was either in control already or his luck was great. Like he said, "He is very lucky man". First two parts were near perfect, though some characters were just annoying.<br/><br/>Rio, is just a cry-baby, and it never feels so true in season 3 when he breaks up with Tokyo inside the bank. WTF!! Some people will say, what Tokyo did was stupid by getting drunk. But that was intentional, and it was mentioned a quite a few times that she's hotheaded. This was her character, letting emotions getting best of her.<br/><br/>Alisson parker, thank god she's not in season 3, what a terrible character, and the actress who played her wasn't much better either.<br/><br/>Artuito, he was pain in the ass, I'm just glad his role was cut short in season 3. Hope he stays on sideliens in season 4 too.<br/><br/>After finishing seaosn 2, it seemed like the perfect way to end it. I was worries that Netflix trying to create season 3 of it can be disastrous, but the way opened it is just amazing and I was hooked from first episode.<br/><br/>I'm also glad, that season 3 is shorter. It removed much of the filler from previous seasons.<br/><br/>Regarding the ending of season 3, I knew someone's gonna die in the season finale. But the way they end this season was just beyond my imagination. When a show ends, which you begging for more, you know you did a damn good job. The idea is great, but... Inappropriate pace, awful and cheesy drama and love stories, completely unnecessary scenes and episodes, instead of two seasons, should have been only one. One of the most interesting tv-shows Ive ever watched It's a simple plot. Nothing compared to others. You can predict every single action along the way. Best Heist Series i had ever seen...when the storyline, screenplay, execution, casting and direction falls in place u get such masterpiece! Every episode is exciting and some real good performance by many of the cast. I was able to hold on to the show for a few episodes because it's intelligent at times but eventually the stereotypical characters and forceful plots to make it a thriller gets too much to handle. Show would have been great probably a decade back! If one wants to learn how to NOT overact or go over the top, this one is for you . It has got its moments but Tokyo and Arthro take the award for overactive of the century.. No other series has so much action, twists and turns, suspense & character development. You think you've figured it out, but surprise after surprise after surprise makes you obsessed with binge watching until the very end! Just finished it and feel like watching again!!! I'm not the sort of person who enjoys heist storylines and I fell asleep while watching more than one Oceans movie however I found this series to be more than a bit gripping though I'm not sure why. I'm not a major fan of the main character or her destructive romance and I think it requires a major suspension of belief to imagine anyone pulling this off ,but once you do suspend belief this series carries you along with it and you find yourself hoping they succeed. A great series made with great taste. The actors seemed to settle in perfectly. Everything was to be loved about it. The best movie i had ever seen in my life...Very nice story with action with love😍😍😍this movie its 10/10 A truly masterpiece! The direction was phenomenal and roles were perfectly done If you see this serie you dont shy for watching that, i promis you. The best of all the series ever, Spanish cinema leads the way to Holywood Especially the second season - very good! Keep me under pressure all the time! If I were asked to answer the best series, then it would be 'La Casa de Papel' also known as 'Money Heist'<br/><br/>In addition,the ending was......🙏 The best TV series I have ever watched in my life. Best with everything.. Starts off as an interesting heist movie with some interesting characters but quickly becomes a far fetched love story. 
Cringed during the first episode of season 2 and find it unwatchable now I started this series and I gave up after 4 episodes. It seemed so full of cliches. I restarted, gave it a second chance, and it got me hooked for a while actually. Until it started to become so romanced in a silly way, that it hurt to watch. I continued to the end though and the end was the HIGHEST deception. You cannot be the chief officer of such a huge case and just fall in love with the head of the operation after 5 days!! and to the point that you cannot tell wrong from right and worst, you totally forget about your daughter, your career, everything and you just want to cover the bad guys. Really, a shameful end. If i had the time i would do a number of questions about the stupid things that this show have ... <br/><br/>let just remind me one or two ... <br/><br/>1 - So the old lady has Alzheimer ... she forgets everything .... expect that her daughter went to bed with the professor !!!! hahahaaha a :D amazing !! <br/><br/>2 - "Look i have the accident video here on my cellphone !! " seems like some scene toked from "POLICE SQUAD" ... :D ....hahaahhahaha <br/><br/>well i could state more ... but check for yourself !! :) <br/><br/>all the best ! The Professor hopes so. He's been planning obsessively for years, refining his father's original scheme as a kind of homage. He's an unusual criminal - unworldly, socially gauche, possibly a little autistic - but his planning has been meticulous and he also carefully assembles and trains a team for the job. Like the plans for 9/11, but without the deaths and destruction - at least that's the theory. Maybe human nature has some surprises in store for him.<br/><br/>This is a beautifully executed and original Spanish series that's now available subtitled on Netflix. Acting from all the leads is very strong and they've taken the time available in a series to add some depth and background to the characters. The structure and suspense of the plot are sustained through to the end of the second series. Few things turn out to be simply black and white. <br/><br/>There's no getting away from it that the Spanish sometimes talk fast and following the subtitles isn't always easy, but it's worth the effort. There are a few mistakes in the translation and some phrases seem a little jarring and unnatural in the English, but this is my only small issue with an excellent series. 9/10. I'v waited for something much better, idk why are people too much about this I have seen lot of psychos who have given 1 or 2 rating to this drama I don't know how can some one has such a bad taste may be they are only the how I met your mother and tower heist type or the ones who don't have patience to sit and watch just 4 or 5 episodes and then review. Please don't compare it with "prison break" it's 100 times intresting and witty than prison break. I like the idea how master mind planned the heist with out voulnetry involving any one in the murder plus it's not like long stretched American serials with every season every year for 7 or 12 years most of the fans die in between and the serial never ends. Acting was excellent specially the character Berlin and professor. My suggestion is just give it a try if you can follow serials for 6 or 7 seasons for years there is no harm in watching 2 seasons of such an amazing and refreshing drama. What a great series! I binge watched them for 2 days in roll. It's intense action and very clever made series. I totally recommend it to anyone. From beginning to end, this TV show is just a work of art.
Viva Spain, and viva La Casa de Papel. This is one of the best series I've ever seen. Truly Mindblowing... I can watch it over and over again. great acting, I literally couldn't sleep after watchting this masterpiece!
A must watch! Briefly, I really enjoyed this series. I finished the whole 13 episodes in two days!. When is the 2nd year coming out?
The main drawback(minor one) was the dubbing. Some voices did not match with the characters. I found Birlin out standing as well as the Professor. How I wanted them to succeed(well that was the whole idea as per the professor)<br/><br/>Remindes me of The David Baldachi book called 'The Winner' I was rooting for the bad guy!! I absolutely love how they wrote this show.
Maybe not everyone can tell, but the way some of these shots are written out is just pure gold.<br/><br/>Also, the storyline is a beast, with the constant plot twists & the bits and pieces of info coming your way. <br/><br/>I am truly scared that s2 is going to be a stretch, also i do have a lot of faith in these writers. 
You should really watch this in Spanish, to get your dose of conjo's and puta's! Enjoyed viewing . waiting for new season. Binge watching series It's a part of probability that a great many improbable things will happen. And this series proves that point. Since we must suspend our disbelief while engrossed in the story, Money Heist makes it easy with plausible plot twists that keep the viewer on the edge of the couch. Great production values, superior acting. Beautiful series without doubt. Twists and turns are convincing. Denver's laugh is infectious and Berlin's style.. wow.<br/><br/>Worst was to see Arturo.. Hated him everytime he came up with same over schemes over and over again. Not sure why he was introduced back after Season 2.<br/><br/>Not sure why everyone was against even punching or hitting if not shooting. Denver is apologising to Arturo for punching him for talking rubbish about son he left. Stockholm is crying because Denver hits Arturo for abusing her. What are these guys..f'in saints or what!? So surreal. It's actually one of the best action series, it's amazing like you feel that you're with them and it's great, really enjoyed it Just finished watching season 2 in a stretch and I want more of this. This is a refreshment to the audience. The cast is very mature in its acting, dialogues are crisp and the background score is icing on the cake.<br/><br/>The script is epic and screenplay is brilliant which grasps you til the ea=nd with the nail biting drama. You will keep asking yourself 'What will happen next ?' You will connect to each of the characters in one or the other way.<br/><br/>I just can't end my review without mentioning Pedro Alonso who plays 'Berlin'. A standing ovation to this gentleman. I won't go into the detail but you will love and hate him at the same time.<br/><br/>This is a must watch. Cheers. I luv this show. I waas so sad when I thoght it ended at seasaon 2, then when I saw seaason 3 on netflix i was sups excitd!! It is a must watch! so good I had to login to write this review as what i was reading from previous users is crazy talk.<br/><br/>This show is why I pay for Netflix, the show is truly amazing the plot, the twist the action sequences everything is totally fire. I cannot wait for season 5 and this deserves to be in the top 10 tv series of all time.<br/><br/>The first two seasons were amazing but then it got better and better, the music, the atmosphere, the acting is on point. You will love the characters Moscow, Denver, Nairobi, Tokyo. Of course the professor is the key also.<br/><br/>You will not be able to sleep after you see season 4 last episode and cliff hanger. Believe me if you know anything about film you will love this show. Users who class this anything less then 9 are wacko's. Don't compare real life to money heist, coz it's excellent work of fiction and imagination just enjoy the series.
And Support them.

And why nairobi died?? Rio should die This is one of the century series that you need to watch... Graet suspense from the beginning great comeback. I love it..... I hope they wouldn't Disturb the Sargio Rachel paradise I hope the beauty between Sagio and Rachel would not be spoiled One of the greatest television shows I've watched..... Loved all the seasons, curiously waiting for 5!jus amazing I swear that the writer of this series must be 10 times more smarter than PROFESSOR. Everything was so perfectly plotted, that I was not watching but I was also the part of the heist. Season 1 and 2 were the best seasons, but my heart shattered into pieces when my faviorite character died in season 4. I can't wait for the season 5. Because I am constantly having dreams at night about Professor, Nairobi and other characters. This is the first time I am reviewing some TV show, It was fire. One of the most fantastic and i intelligent series I've ever seen! Also I would like to add the amazing fact that in part 4 they added a transgender person like me so that melted my heart!
Well done! Love the series! The actors are great, the dialogues are often really deep and the suspense is brilliant, especially the forth fourth season. I had my doubts whilst I was watching the third season but the fourth was brilliant! Waiting now for the fifth... I had never ever watch a show that with every season it getting better I really can't wait what is going to happen next Every season is getting better than the old , well done It is filmed as a high quality tv show, but the plot, the acting, the dialogues... it is just stupid and annoying. Really great and addicting series , binge watching it is really recommended. It is full of excitement and enthusiasm. I hope new seasons come.
Some important sequences from the whole story are missing, I mean escapades The best show I have seen in years! The cast and writer's were amazing, as well as the set!<br/><br/>I highly recommend! I couldn't stop watching! I see people saying this the most overrating of all but this one is out there because of it's perfect symbols. La resistencia. Excellent story with excellent implementation. But what I want to emphasize is the acting work. I would like to congratulate all the actor and actress! My favourite scene when Moscow die in the first series. I only upset with part 4, when Nairobi died. I thought that Tokyo should be die instead of her, because she had no kind or respect for plan... Today I watched season 4 all episodes (Lot of free time under lock down) but I am disappointed. Series 1 and 2 were awesome and l would give 10 points, this one I'd say 5. Truly Awesome and well written and Directed and I want to see the end. All season are going crazy,hats off to the team,all the best,every single character is unique The best series of my days .Incredible
i love it very much A brilliant chess game between the leftist resistance and the capitalist pigs
Bella ciao Money Heist came in as a highly recommended series , by many of my friends and it did not disappoint. Its an 'almost masterpiece' which at times failed to keep up with the dizzying plot build up that it had over the first few episodes. It's about a group of robbers spearheaded by the meticulous mastermind 'El Profesor' (Álvaro Morte) who plans to rob the 'The Royal Mint' by printing 2.4 billion Euros and thereby accomplishing the biggest heist ever !
Like most of the heist stories of our times, the group is carefully assembled together from scratch by the brain of the whole operation and here its the Professor. He teaches and prepares the team of robbers for 6 months so that they can pull off the perfect heist and go by their chosen city names. Thus, the calm and composed Berlín (Pedro Alonso), hothead and narrator/heroine Tokio (Úrsula Corberó) , genius counterfeiter Nairobi ( Alba Flores), computer whizkid Río (Miguel Herrán) , the father son duo of Denver and Moscow and the muscles of the twin brothers come together to take hostages and lock out the Royal Mint as they go about their business of printing Money. On the other side of the fence is the brilliant Raquel Murillo ( Itziar Ituño) who heads the investigation against the Professors team.
Money Heist has its fair share of ups and downs throughout and some of the plot twists could not have been timed any better. Even with all that what got to my nerve is the fact that is the character of Tokio, from whose point of view the whole heist is explained. Every single time something goes south in the plan we know whom to point to fingers at and this was probably a masterstroke by the creator Álex Pina. It always add to the intrigue when you dislike the main character and yet love the plot. 
I ended up binge watching both the seasons of 'Money Heist ' and loved it for most parts. If you are into thriller genre and can ignore a few unwanted (read - boring) scenes you would end up loving the series like I did. The fact that they ended it properly after the second season is a huge plus point and this is something I would definitely recommend to anybody who love thrillers and can ignore small deficiencies and yeah, the writers definitely believed in the phrase 'love is blind and stupid'. English voiceovers destroy this show. The storyline is chaotic to begin with-add in mismatched poorly acted voiceovers, and the show becomes unwatchable. I'm not sure how it has a high rating-perhaps watching the original acting makes all the difference-but I can't see how the often weird and incredibly sexist dialogue or disconnected storyline carry even the original. Enjoyed with the movie to the maximum!! Really great idea, nice plot, actors are good !! Every episode I watched with a big interest! Very nice , but the police dosnt use that turn off the lights , why ? It missed some things to be real , but its nice has suspicions It was not possible to use footage of the real house of currency. the impressions of money were actually made in a newspaper The tv show have a great casting and i couldn't stop watching till the end. Season 3 was borderline but wow does season 4 make up for it!!!
Reviews that its plot is unbelievable, jeez have you watched GOT???
Great characters,loved it
Cant wait for season 5 Don't forget, it's just a show to entertain us. So enjoy the show.. S1 was the best season of this heist movie 10/10
S2 was drama , thriller halfaway and the last 2 episodes was awesome 9/10
I still didn't see S3 &S4
I Don't know why U guys say Should Have Stop on S2. This series has a many awards and nominees. They Have To Expand the movie.
If it stops on S2 it will be very short movie
In short word It is an Amazing Action- Packed Thriller Movie S1 was the very best season in the movie. 10/10
S2 was good and the ending was amazing 9/10
I Still Didnt see S3 and S4
For me, It is an amazing heist film. This series is shows how much a great screenplay can enhance a normal storyline. Actors are top notch. Just when you think everything is coming to an end, you see new beginnings in the story. What a rollercoaster ride. don't miss. Everyone is a critic as Hemingway used to say. And in reading here,,some of the reviewers are way too passionate about their backstage opinion, such hate. is almost as if they envy the show's success, or the happiness of others and they consider themselves so intelligent but I'd like to see them winning an Emmy or even nominated.<br/><br/>Come on people is tv, is entertainment, of course everything could go wrong, and a lot does not make sense, nothing does if you overthink it.
Entertainment, that's what tv is for.
To Escape into alternative realities, either fictional or non fictional.<br/><br/>I believe this was the purpose of this show, to entertain. And I gave it 10 stars because it entertained me fully from beginning to end. This show is just mind blowing. Best show ever made. I literally couldn't stop watching. It's soo addictive that one episode is never enough and the plots are just beyond shocking. Masterclass Money Heist is auch a quality show. Each cast member seems perfect for his/her role. Professor, Berlin, Tokyo, Nairobi etc. Looks like they are made for this.
Just 2 flaws in my opinion
1. Tokyo's character sometimes becomes annoying. Writers should pay attention to that. Considering the level of the job she is doing, she should be more professional rather than being childish. And also, after all this time she should have learnt her lesson.
2. The actress playing thd pregnant police officer should learn a thing or two about how a 8-9 pregnant lady moves. She moves swiftly, leans on tables and walk speedily. She should have worked on her character better. I've given this series a 10. I've only given about 8 of my 150 odd watches a 10.<br/><br/>Well written, great action, great characters, great twists, sexy, violent, bloody, well filmed, high budget. The drama of curiosity & anxiety that what would happen next and how would they escape made this TV series mind blowing. People more often like to watch the win of police/FBI but it the team of Professors & the script writer made us believe that the thieves are the heroes.
I'm a big fan of this TV series & would hope that you guys will continue to show us the masterpiece.
Some people are criticizing that they took more seasons to unfold the drama,but that's what curiosity requires. I appreciate that. Whole Twitter is talking about you. Everyone wants to be like professor or Berlin or Nairobi.
Love you all. Will always be a big fan. Every episode is a masterpiece. More of this serie please ;-) Its a good show to watch overall, but season 4 has been by far the best so far, theres more action, more cliffhangers and more suprises than in previous 3 seasons. Cant wait for season 5 to be released. Goosebumps, exsiting and very good manuscript.
Great action! I love this show!!! Everybody should see this amazing masterpiece. Some series you will find such interesting that will change your perception about life and money heist one of them. Such mind-blowing acting by every character of suspense darama thriller script. Must watch if you want good content The best series so far ... It keeps you always in suspense ... you will always be curious what will happen after you have watched an episode Amazing tv serie! Best of the Best!
Haven't watched a movie or a serie like this before and i Do not think that any tv series will be above of this one. Great job and thanks again for this excellent story. Very clever and it is so addictive. In the season 3 episode 4 there is a scene where a guy enters in the seif full of water and put's a c-4 to blow a door. Under water, is true that bullets don't travel a long distance, like 1 meter maybe, whit explosive it's anoter story. In that scene the scubadiver is not more than 6-7 meters away from the explosion, in such short distante, if a c-4 explodes, the explosion blast under water will be so big that your lungs will explode from the presure that the blast will make. that's why i'm not giving 10 stars I will give almost any Holywood actor for almost any actor in this TV show. And a big thumbs up for the producer!
In any idiot american movie, you will get 1000 kills per season and stupid fake drama.
But not this one. Season 3 did not disappoint. New characters fit in well and keep the acting levels to the highest!
One of my biggest fears was that the show would lose its Spanish essence and would try to please international audiences, specially the US market. It happened somehow in the first two seasons, in which some characters, police mainly, talked in a very polished way, far from the Spanish real style. But I must say that dialogues in third season appear more real: rude and full of cursing.... just the way we are. All of you who don't like this series- please go to the gym, stop eating donuts, find yourself some friends and a partner in life. Maybe this will help you to stop being a HATER,who spends the whole day HATINGS great movies because of their miserable life :))) Please get a life , you poor Americans ðŸ˜¢ Not a very interesting series at all. It may be good in the original Spanish but the dubbing is so poor and so trite, it really destroys the viewing the experience. I always prefer to just see subtitles rather a really poor job of dubbing in the dialogue. For the most part, the series is very silly. Interesting plot and some good acting but I have to say the show writers knew how to dramatize, and in order to achieve that dramatic effect they threw logic under the bus on many different occasions. Several self contradictory plot holes can be found.<br/><br/>The show is still gripping in the sense the overall plot is pretty great and the actors have done well.<br/><br/>But the biggest flaw in the show that i wanted to mention was Tokyo's acting. Was she supposed to be the protagonist? She was basically the character I least identified with, in fact i found her deeply annoying (the character and the acting).<br/><br/>In the end, season 1 was really good. 9/10. season 2 was a drag, almost as if the show writers made the show with the intent of "stalling time". In general i am a sci-fi aficionado , but series like breaking bad and casa de papel are a wonderful change of theme into the real world.
The story and development is gripping and will glue you to your seat . Some developments are predictable if you think about them but there are always surprises , i've watched the whole season in 2 days and i couldn't get enough of it. Some say the acting was weak, not it was not weak, yes sometimes actors were overreacting but people complaining do not have the ability to enter the psyche of the people participating. If you were in such a treacherous situation, with hostages, the possibility of ruining your and other's life and any mistake can cost dearly then yes one would be shaking. The reason they say Berlin was a strong actor is simply down to his psychological profile. Plot holes? I have not noticed anything that has not been explained in one manner or another, yes there were some holes but this is a serial just enjoy it. I did not find the plot weak at all and every mistake by the robbers could have serious repercussions if not for lady luck playing its part, but eventually their luck might run out. I assume the hate comes from people who do not wish to read subtitles and play it dubbed which would ruin the whole experience. I never watch anything dubbed as it destroys the colour of any movie/serial. Por favor watch it in the original language ...then stop reading this. I won't bother with the fact that the story progresses oh so slowly, nor with the repetitive music. I won't even fret over the amount of patience this series demands from you the way it drags certain scenes.<br/><br/>I will just mention the 3 lapses of logic that baffle me.
Spoilers for Season 2 ahead<br/><br/>1. The clown scene<br/><br/>Maybe if the scene took place in an open space, like a square, then it would make sense how a few clowns got the police confused. But the hospital has what? A couple of exits and entrances? And they were all covered by police officers. And when they saw the clowns, instead of lining them all up to question them, they just allow them to leave in peace. The most conspicuous of all the clowns was of course the cyberpunk Professor, who still managed to roam the hallways undetected. 
All the while 2 police officers were undercover in Angel's room pretending to be himself and his wife. And suddenly they see a doorknob turning...oh the suspense! The suspense built out of the logic that although all the hospital had cameras the one place the police didn't bother to cover was the hallway where their comatose witness was about to be attacked. And for all the disguised police force as doctors and nurses, not even one man was assigned to keep a lookout outside the room. Maybe a clown distracted them by making balloon animals.<br/><br/>
2. I left you unconscious to prove I love you<br/><br/>First of all, Salva, you are the worst boyfriend ever. Not only did you start this relationship out of pure self interest, you are so full of yourself that you feel the certainty that the woman is so infatuated by you, that even when handing her over a gun, she won't shoot you. A professional policewoman, that risked everything on this case, the one you betrayed and irreparably violated her trust, will let you go away, with not so much as even a bullet in your leg.
And you know what? She does exactly that. She actually lets him go. To what end? Even if she loves him, she knows that eventually she would get in trouble.<br/><br/>3. Inspectora has a free pass because Casa de Papel Logic<br/><br/>The HQ is fully aware that the Inspectora has an affair with el Professor, so instead of interrogating and detaining her, they simple let her leave the premises. I was under the impression that in such grave situations when people's lives are on the line, even the slightest of suspicions are enough to keep a person in custody. But no, la Inspectora is only a suspect at that moment, and she also wants to go, so yeah, let her go. What could go wrong? After all she convinced you with the lamest line in all the series "I will prove to you I didn't know who that man was until recently, by giving up his whereabouts". Funny, because do you know who would also know this piece of information? His co-conspirator girlfriend. And when it turns out that the location she gives was not right (as any dedicated girlfriend would do in order to distract and delay the police) how do they react? They let her go, saying that only Angel can help them now. And she goes in the hospital, steals the badge and then Angel opens his eyes at such a convenient moment for the script that forces me to write all the above.<br/><br/>La Casa de Papel has some likable characters and a promising premise. However, after all the slow progression even its good qualities start to wither and you are left with the aforementioned divorces with logic which are simply too much to swallow. <br/><br/>The only way to enjoy this series is if it's the first one you have watched in you life or if you turn off your brain while watching it. Story is not bad but some of the characters are not believable due to the Really bad overacting and clichÃ©d phrases...struggled to watch it at times and Was disappointed after such great reviews The complexity of the planning is enthralling but there are many naive plot pony's and the whole thing is WAY too long. Spanish series over everything it's been by now on theatre! Congrats! I absolutely love this show! It's exciting and suspenseful with romance and passion! I can't get the song bella ciao out of me head! So excited for part 5 I don't know why everyine is disliking season 4 so much, I have rarely seen a season of a show be SO entertaining and suspenseful! I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. Please watch it, it is seriously spectacular. The quality of the plot is lower in season 4 but is still good. Already attached to the characters, so can't stop watching. Season 5 has to be the final season for sure though. I'm very happy to watch a very special series like this series, but I'm sorry I can't give you more than 7 stars because I don't like to watch a gay scenes and you didn't respect that for me, if you need to embed like this gay scenes and can't make a respective series just write a gay series and I know many of us will skip this series and don't watch it, or mark a choice for us to skip these scenes when appears.That's my marks. Thank you I really don't know why breaking bad is more popular than this when these series have a story a lot better. It has nothing negative, it is uniqueIt has nothing negative, it is unique It has nothing negative, it is unique What started as an ambiguous show on a Spanish TV channel, became one of the most popular shows in the world. There has never been a more popular TV series not in the english language. And i'm glad Netflix shared this amazing show to the world.<br/><br/>If it highlighted one thing, it is that many Americans still don't understand Europeans and their style of film making. They are so accustomed only to their shows, they can't fandom anything that is presented to them from outside.<br/><br/>One of the major "flaws" i see being brought up is that the characters are unrealistic and not believable. On the contrary, i think they perfectly show the real human nature. Real people, real emotions, different situations, with their highs and lows. It's something you will see, if such things happened to a regular person. European film makers have always showed more feelings in their work, because Europeans are that way.<br/><br/>Many Americans expected an action heist series, with their typical robot characters seen in every criminal / police shows, who are always cool under pressure, never miss a shot, know what to do in every situation... LCDP is not like that. Every character enters in the heist with a job, but their actions are fueled much more by their inner feelings, their scares, their beliefs, their struggles, their dreams. They can't be perfect all the time. Of course they will make mistakes, of course they will make snap-decisions without thinking. Every person will act that way in such high-tense circumstances.<br/><br/>The character relationships is the base and what makes LCDP. First of all i dont get why the show is getting so much hate. I really enjoyed it. And yes season 3 and 4 were a bit more boring than the previous 2 but they were good. The characters are so well made and the actors really did a good job, especially Alvaro. I fell in love with The character. All of the emotions he felt i did too. Everytime someone died i could feel
it. And my god am i in live with Bella Ciao. I cant stop listening to it. I absolutely loved the show.<br/><br/>It is a Global Phenomenon.<br/><br/>And I also dont understand the people who rated the show 1/10. They probably just stand the fact that show is Actually good. The trailer was intriguing, the user ratings suggested it would be good, but but but.. it just wasn't. I didn't care for the characters or the back stories, I got bored and quit after episode 4. Shame. Overrated piece of mindless garbage deliberately created to put your braincells into a never-ending coma I think this was one of the best series i have seen so far. Didn't like Nairobi death though. All characters were amazing. Firstly.... do not watch this series in dubbed English, its horrible... watch the subtitles<br/><br/>Secondly, i consider myself to be bit of a critical sort, when it comes to TV shows and i am very rarely impressed, especially by anything that isn't a documentary. However this show is incredible, it is clever, well thought out, incredibly well acted and produced that i cannot understand where reviews of 1 stars are coming from?!?<br/><br/>If i had listened to these reviews, i would never have enjoyed the absolutely brilliant series that this is.<br/><br/>DO NOT listen to 1-3 star reviews, they are totally unrealistic, over opinionated by people who i can only assume watched it dubbed whilst tapping away on their phones. I was totally engrossed, and loved every minute of every episode. my 9/10 would be 9.5/10 really, a realistic and not inflated review of this fantastic charachterful TV Show.<br/><br/>Luncacy at some of the ratings.....the show is brilliant....<br/><br/>...... Just don't watch it dubbed, as it does do your head in. Good premise, but lacks a watchable plot. I found myself fast forwarding a lot in the last few episodes of season 1 The problem with heavy plots is that they require characters to make incredibly stupid decisions to keep the thing moving along. This story has people making totally ridiculous choices, that not even the thickest person living in Thickland would make, otherwise the show would have been over after two episodes. Yet we are also asked to believe that the Prof is able to predict every move by everyone. The sheer incompetence of the police is just there to serve the plot. And as for the attempt to make us like the criminals, in our house we are now shouting "They are bank robbers FFS" I don't know why they made season 3 and 4 they muat have concluded in season 2 itself.
The story is just stretched like a rubber band for no good. This is marketed as Smart/Witty thriller series out there. Well only one Character "The Professor" is ... also, as he himself say he is "Lucky".. Unusually and most of the time.
Moreover, over the top acting and situations ... its like half of kidnaped women wana makeout with their kidnappers...
I have to admit though some ideas are well placed and seem realistic enough
like predicting some moves of abducted people, escape by some etc. but again scene shift back gears to Soap opera like atmosphere rather than a thriller.
Those who have any hopes of Socialistic ideas or philosophic undertones {as many reviews say} will be disappointed. I really, really thought the idea and some script was unique and interesting. But there was too many things that was not good. The police were so stupid. I only wanted a good heist show with good action but no, that was too much to ask for. Everything felt too slow in the money bank too. Painful outcome after a good idea. But overall ok show It seemed promising, but from the first episode I kept drawing comparisons between this show and Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs from the way they set up the heist planning to giving the members their names to the fact that the entire series is supposed to be the event of the heist. I thought maybe I was unfairly comparing it to a critically acclaimed director, until the show compared ITSELF to a Tarantino scene and acknowledged the similarity when one of the characters said the Spanish equivalent of "what is this? A Tarantino film?" and that's why it falls flat. It tries too hard to be that and make two of the protagonists, The Professor and Berlin, the type of character that goes on a meandering speech that eventually makes it way back to the topic in that Tarantino-esque style of writing, but instead of a metaphor that goes full circle everything they say seems clunky and random: essentially 'here's how your sex life is related to this situation' every single time. It also doesn't work because the professor's character is inconsistent in his confidence which is needed for that type of character. All the main characters (aside from Denver and his dad) are inconsistent, some are way too empathetic (never thought I's say that) to be criminals.
The show starts developing characters and then forgets about them, moves onto the main plot (the heist) and then randomly goes back to a character for five seconds several episodes later. It doesn't know to be how to be melodramatic and when to move on. It's one quarter plot development, one quarter characters randomly bringing up personal things that are dropped and never brought up again or brought up episodes later, and half pointless filler. I agree with others that it ultimately drags a plot that could be wrapped up in 2 1/2 hours. It's also amazing how it manages to drag on with anything really happening considering how many side plots there are:
-Rio and Tokyo's love affair
-Raquel and her partners weird semi-romantic relationship
-Raquel's abusive ex
-Raquel's mom's Alzheimers???
-Raquel's child wanting to move out and into her ex's home
-The professors weird obsessive relationship with the lead investigator (why is he trying to have a romantic relationship with the women hunting him down?)
-Rio's personal struggle with being a part of the heist
<ul><li>Monica and Arturo's relationship and their lovechild</li></ul>-Berlin betraying orders and saving Monica
-Monica developing feelings for her capture, Berlin
-Tokyo's identity crisis
<ul><li>Nairobil's child and her complete lack of character development</li></ul><br/><br/>and yet it was such a slow burn and my 12 year old sister snd I were able to predict most of the episodes events ahead of time Mannerism of each and every role has been crafted. Salute to Director and Art director. I was amazed with Camera work in the complete series. Music adds the lot of value to Series which is the biggest advantage i would say. Pre-planned and back up plan for back up plans which was amazing skill of professor. Everytime when critical time comes story goes back to flashback where how it got reminded and implanted in team is an amazing art of work. All 4 Seasons are equal and thrilled everytime. Who could ever think of mixing music, love, hatred, money,suspense,killing and make such an intensive emotional concoction which makes you never want an episode to end. Before this show, I was like "a show can't come near to prison break" but nope..this one is as great as prison break and maybe even better(for some)...the only flaws is that..their seasons are too short...I finish 1 season in 1 day of binch watching. This is the most interesting web series I had ever seen . Its fast pace keeps you in every moment . Worth watching The beginning is the solid,it will take you to a thrilling and engaging ride till season2 but later will ditch you and force you.Some scenes are not worth it. The rescue of Tokyo and the escape of the professor from the inspector,the shootout scene when Tokyo gets back inside using the police motorcycle is the worst of them. I really loved it, Can't wait for the next season to come out. Everything is good,acters,writer and producer...
I love all of acters in this serial and if you dont watch this, i suggest to you watch it and enjoy No logic, no rationale, no research, no science just mindless plot lines. The first two seasons were brilliant. The other seasons could've been masterpieces but it's just turned into a circus with dumb writing inexplicable nonsense. There's so much irrational stuff that you could go on and on about how foolish the scenes and plot devices were. The attention to detail is almost non-existent. Great series and a great season but I am really disappointed in the way Nairobi was taken out. If at all you had to end the character, she could have died fighting Ghandia. Not to be killed by him in armed. She's a fighter! Should have stopped from 2nd season,No logic. So much hype of this show but not worth it, dont waste your time on this If you want to see a show which is completely illogical the go for it One of finest Series,all seasons has emotions, feeling, romantic, twists n turn. We strongly agree the lengthy episodes. This is a phenomenon. Money Heist ruled the Netflix for a time. The play and the scenes are unexpected and too good. This is a best heist in the television history. Though some characters and their emotions disturbed the play this driven straight at the end episodes. Money Heist is a great Spanish series and well worth watching.
The only unfortunate part is that the dubbing into English is really bad, besides that very enjoyable. Pull 2 all-nighters watching this show. It's really good and you won't be disappointed. Most addictive tv show i have seen so far. First episode would not give u any clue as to what the viewer is in for. Great series. Brilliant cast and production. Underlying story tells you to prepare for unexpected in any situation. How one should assume and predict next cause if action. This is my favourite series ever. I have never been so enthralled by a TV series. I watched it with really poor English subtitles, yet that didn't detract from this incredible show.
Like the crime itself, the series has been beautifully crafted; a work of genius. Nothing compares... WOW this is a piece of art! THE STORY is so emotional, and the actors are so real! AMAZING! This series is one of the best series i ever seen, the plot of this series is best one and the director put his all thought whether it is negative or positive, the 5 month plan is a appropriate time in which they put their thought and success in there mission. Don't worry about other useless reviewers ... each and every episode is nail biting , edge of the seat thriller ...one of the best shows ever ...!!! People might try to reduce its popularity just cos it's not American made 🤷‍♂️ I have no idea why this series isn't even rated above 9. It's one of the few series where I never even feel like checking my phone. And where I feel I know everyone in the series. It's a masterpiece I hope never ends. Unbelievable watch. blitzed it all within a week..
shame season 5 could be a hefty wait 😬 Reviewing after watching Season 2 Episode 7.
This series exactly feels like Prison Break just a bunch of interesting sequences and ideas with a lot of filler. I installed a plugin and watching it in 2x speed in Netflix multiple times. Amazing show really interesting not boring at all but season 4 wasn't quite amazing needs s5 to be really good to get back at the track I don't understand what these people want to convey by saying stop at season 02 ,<br/><br/>this is like the Prison Break , 1st season you break out , 2nd season you settle .<br/><br/>like wise this is following the pat , I loved season 3 and 4 as well. After reading most of the reviews here it is clear that end of the season two is the best point to stop. I think I'm making the right decision. Watch until season 2 which is 10/10. However, season 3 and season 4 specially go downhill pretty fast with a lot of unrealistic elements. Avoid them at all costs. Well it is one of the best series ever made on money heist...started watching the series with my elder brother recommendation...first two seasons were awesome 👌...remaining two were good but lacked the thrill though the planning was brilliant...loved Berlin character much than the Professor (personal opinion)....eagerly waiting for the next season...one extra star since my wife watched with me the first non Indian series...May be the last:) The professor, he will keep your mind twisted and you'll love his acting. Hype comes from the uneasy atmosphere and one of the finest actors that this series has. Please go by the Meta Score. This series is a masterpiece in real. Waiting for the 5th season. Kindly watch and decide. Never ever trust fake reviews. The show kill keep you on the edge of your seats. First 2 seasons redefines perfect crime. Big fan of berlin. Personally feel it should have ended with the second season. Seasons 3&4 didn't live up to the bar raised in earlier seasons Lockdown has some perks. I binged watched this from start to finish. Brilliant series. Yeh the dubbing is a pain but its better than sub titles. This is one to watch. If ur ever planning on robbing a bank. You mite want to take notes from this. Watching in 2019 during iso. Engaging and interesting concept. Watched the entire first season in a few days. Just started the second season and it still hasn't disappointed The best series out there,....
A must watch for anyone looking to watch some good content.
Narration is super awesome... Even though this is a dubbed series, we were totally wrapped up into it, It is good concept of a heist but like some people are saying it does get carried away and it should have finished after a few season. Over all the thought was good, but the officer getting involved and falling in love with the mastermind was taken too far and other issues also along the way that were taken too far. The first two season got me addicted! Contains love and emotions mixed with betrayal and strategy Just finished watching season 2 in a stretch and I want more of this. This is a refreshment to the audience. The cast is very mature in its acting, dialogues are crisp and the background score is icing on the cake.<br/><br/>The script is epic and screenplay is brilliant which grasps you til the ea=nd with the nail biting drama. You will keep asking yourself 'What will happen next ?' You will connect to each of the characters in one or the other way.<br/><br/>I just can't end my review without mentioning Pedro Alonso who plays 'Berlin'. A standing ovation to this gentleman. I won't go into the detail but you will love and hate him at the same time.<br/><br/>This is a must watch. Cheers. Season four is missing a few episodes for it to be complete. Exceptionally brilliant. Completely unpredictable. No nonsense. I feel like I'm watching a thrilling Hollywood blockbuster. The stereotype of the character professor is not uncommon from previous shows, movies, even novels, but what the show did is focus on details, different stages of the robbery, deep insight of contemplation, countermeasure deployment, plot twists and surprises. The whole show is a close and clear demonstration of dynamic shifts. The rhythm of the show is elastic and tasteful. Everyone has different reviews. But my fella and I loved it. Even though it had English voice over. Granted there were a few cringe worthy moments but that's what makes it not run smoothly. Be pretty dull if they made no mistakes. The heist team are great and I have to admit I shed a few tears too. So come on crack on with season 5 we are waiting.
Watch it and see for yourselves if you like it or not, if we had gone on the reviews we wouldn't have watched it and we couldn't stop. My cousin was insisting me watch this show from quite some time...and I only got a chance to pick this during this lockdown time, trust me I haven't regretted a bit - such strong characters, well crafted and narrated, you love them, you hate them (Arturo specifically) but you can ignore them...
#BellaCiao ...except some logic things but it is very entertaining. Good show with more to come! The professor should have hired the dive serbians and Moscow and he would have done it in the first four episodes. The Spanish series "La Casa De Papel" with the English name "Money Heist", which has been translated into Persian as "Paper House", was broadcast for the first time in 2017 on one of the Spanish channels. After that, because the broadcast of this series was welcomed, Netflix decided to broadcast it worldwide. "Paper House" is one of the few non-English language series that has found a global audience, and this is a great success for the creators of the series. The Money Heist series was originally made in two seasons, 13 and 9 episodes, and when it was welcomed, its creators decided to continue the series, and seasons 3 and 4 were also made. Also, the fifth season of this series is going to be made. The series received an average of 8.5 points on Imdb with 222,717 votes. One of the reasons why this series is so popular is its very interesting and exciting subject. The biggest robbery in history is going to happen. The use of diverse actors, the creation of different characters and the complexity of the story have attracted a large audience to this non-English language series. But the point is that the series has major flaws that prevent it from becoming a lasting series. The reason for this can also be the haste in turning exciting and compelling ideas into a powerful script. The story of this series is about a group of thieves with a personal group called Professor who want to rob a money printing plant in Madrid, Spain I don't wanna give it a 10 cause I dont believe in perfection, but it deserves it, cause despite I was convinced by different people to watch it I didn't wanna bother, since I always thought my own country series were boring, predictable and not worth watching. This series gave me hope to believe in Spanish talent for creativity as a unique trait and I thank Netflix for investing on developing such an outstanding masterpiece. Congrats This web series is on a different level. The plot, the logic, the intelligence etc you name it and it's there. Watched all seasons till now, eagerly waiting for the next one. A brilliantly scripted, well arranged series. It's definitely one of the best Netflix has to offer. Especially with the twist in the story-line that goes in favour of both the robbers and the police, this series is really something you can waste time on during this lock down. The last few episodes of season 1 might feel a little slow but you're going to keep watching it till the end until you can finally finish season 2, because that's where things get so wonderfully arranged. The first two seasons are great. In the third, the entry of American capital and adaptation to the neoliberal audience is felt. Women's rights, gay love woes, paterican sense of justice, all for one, etc .. like a steven seagal movie .... They screwed great series .. MONEY HEIST (known in Spanish as La casa de papel) is a Spanish crime drama featuring a group of misfit thieves attempting to rob the Royal Mint of Spain. When a young woman (Úrsula Corberó) loses her partner after a failed bank robbery, she is recruited by a man known only as The Professor (Álvaro Morte) to join a group of misfit criminals who have nothing to lose by participating in a major heist. Now known by the code name Tokio, she joins jewel thief Berlin (Pedro Alonso), check forger Nairobi (Alba Flores), a young hacker known as Rio (Miguel Herrán), father-son team Moscú (Pace Tous) and Denver (Jaime Lorente), and cousins Oslo (Roberto García Ruiz) and Helsinki (Darko Peric), two former Serbian soldiers, in devising a system for taking over the Spanish Mint in order to print out, and escaping with, over two billion Euro. Now, five months later, the group carries out its task. But despite The Professor's strict rules and clearly researched plans, things aren't going as expected. Throughout it all, some of what transpired during the five months of preparation is revealed. Meanwhile, the personal stories of some of the members, hostages, and law enforcement begin to intertwine and get complicated.<br/><br/>This crime drama offers a complex story world that combines components of the traditional bank heist plot line with action sequences and elements of the surreal. Because the series was originally produced as a two-part limited series, the main cast is given the time to evolve into multidimensional characters, which makes them worth investing in. Furthermore, despite the fact that key events are often narrated by Tokio, a range of individual stories are woven together in unexpected ways, broadening the point of view. But despite streaming in shorter installments (and the reliance on subtitles for non-Spanish speaking viewers),Money Heist remains a skillfully crafted, engaging adult-oriented tale that is worth the watch. If one loves seeing english stuffs this really going to make him better on the quarantine days. I love the whole planning of professor.If you start watching this series you can't control yourself to watch the end. An amazing experience to watch this one where you root for characters! First 2 season were 9/10 and 10/10 but from the 3rd season it's good but not up to the mark ,4th season absolutely dragging nothing else ,there was no need of 5th season .so yeah great series with great beginning and a downhill ending ,hope 5th season will be good Whenever you want be a good director you need to do whatever that cause you have a lot of mind play scenes in your drama .
I should say tnx and good luck to sir Pinna
You are the best and you did the best with Money Heist Brilliant script for me as Indian Audiences. I never expected this much twist in same series. Must match I actually really enjoyed this show. They dragged it out a bit but it still gripped me. That said, the final episode drove me nuts. Very non-Hollywood ending, which many appreciate but to my mind it ended on a cliffhanger and so at least one more series is surely coming...please, please, and soon. This is very much a 'lockdown special' Well, what can I say..... Absolutely loved this. It's exciting, thrilling, romantic, fun. Loved it so much. Binged watched it all in lockdown and so sad I'm at the end of season 4. I have recommended to so many people. You have to watch it. Yes it's lipsinked but u get used to that. Fantastic 10 out of 10. I enjoyed the show even with so many blunders n mistakes..its entertaining thats all you need ENTERTAINMENT..All those people complaining about how stupid its is and everything should quit watching TV shows n movies..i am surprised that there is hardly any negative comments about season DARK which is just so boring and repetitive in season 2 where every character time travels whereever they want and it just screws up your brain..why people dont try to find logic there as they are trying really hard to prove how non sense money heist is..it is non sense but its damn entertaining and keeps u on the edge from season 1 to 4..i almost quit after season 2 when heard so many negative reviews about 3.4 but i actually found 3.4 more thrilling and action packed just because there was no stupid Raquel leading the force and wasting time on stupid negotiations over the phone where now police was more on the front foot to give robbers a hard time which made it fun because they knew after the first heist that these robbers are no threat to hostages and bunch of jokers..lol.. #makaut
#actuvity point
Beautiful, li'll underrated accoriding to me!! Season 1,2 was building up the story of some people included their head professor for some heist, but later on we get to knew more. People like me always want any movie or series with some good story, drama, love, friendship as well as a thrill. I got everything. Must watch for all.. Kind of underrated web series!! It's beautiful, people like me, who love thriller as well as some drama, emotions, love, cry, hate, fantasy, science infusion. Money heist is definitely for them. For season 1 & 2 I think I can rate 7/10 , because of some extravagant non reality. But for last 2 season, they've worked on it & made things beautiful .. Season 4 episode 6 was my final episode.. I won't finish the serial without Nairobi !! I have only one word to say "outstanding". I am sure you haven't watch such kind of show in your entire life .it is best and will remain best. Forever Dear all,<br/><br/>If you're just reading and you just came to see reviews like I do most of the time to see if smth is worth watching, I can say this:
WORTH EVERY SECOND!
(consider me as not a fan of robbery movies and stuff and writing this)<br/><br/>CAST IS AMAIZING! Scenario is dinamic and it stitches u to the TV, just PLEASE DO NOT RUIN everything with English audio!<br/><br/>Don't know why people do that anyway.. In my opinion it's at least disrespectful to the language and actors that made a movie or series, especially in these days when you can find subs Anywhere... And if you cannot read.. Well that's a whole other bunch of issues...<br/><br/>*makes it even harder for me to understand last fact since it's in Spanish (one of the most beautiful and known languages)🙄 So far one of the best series to watch. So brilliantly written and executed.This series's theme song is all about the love and ruined. Overnight this show became phenomenon. You won't be disappointed. The only drawback was it sometimes got bogged down in pretty drama. Wow what a series! I never wanted it to end. Even watched the phenomenon which was also amazing.<br/><br/>Would highly recommend to anyone.<br/><br/>Wish there was another hundred seasons. By far the best thing I've ever watched. Nairobi's death reunited El Professor's team. I guess S5 will be more about Alicia. Por Nairobi! This is my first best ever spanish tv series watched !!
All characters well played, great sroty and can't wait to see season 5 !! This series still thrives. After the whole Netflix thing I still think it's good. Seasons 3 and 4 gave a lot of backstory for the characters and the new heist is insanely good.<br/><br/>Overall this series always keeps me on the edge of my seat and it's very entertaining. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a good action packed adventure. The 1st series is my favourite thriller series ever on Netflix . Quite faultless. Great story , direction , acting and screenplay . You could not ask for more from a thriller .
But each subsequent series is not as good as the last sadly and the 4th is just scraping the barrel unfortunately. Its a pity because it began so brilliantly . Very interesting and must watch. All actors are great. First 2 parts will make you stick to your seats. However 3-4 parts are little saw and few shots you might feel bored. Bella ciao song is used awesomely. A very good series. Will keep you on edge. The writing of the show is so incredible. First two seasons were really great and worthy to watch after season 3 was normal amd season 4th was ok. Series must be ended after first two seasons because now Netflix is just ruining the series If you're looking for one of the most thought out series out there, this one is for you. There is absolutely never a dull moment! GREAT!!! Probably one of the best Netflix series I have seen so far. With its unpredictable and overwhelming plot, this series so addictive that one will definitely complete it in binge watch. The series revolves around a very strong, mysterious, genius yet very kind man name Sergio Martinez(The Professor) who spends half of his life planning the biggest robbery in the history with a very dangerous but capable crew. The producer and team has done a really good job creating a tense environment which suits the storyline of the series. All the actors have done a fine job with their characters. No doubt about that. In my opinion, if you love watching crime movies and series, then you should not skip this one. No way! This is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED SERIES.Loveeeeee itt. After completing all four seasons , I must say this is one of the best series i have ever watched . The first two seasons were really good . The story screenplay dialogues everything is compelling. The quality of this show is, it can make you fall for the bad guys. Even though they are thief you root for them see through their eyes.
They have done a lot of research on the character , they all have the background story ,pain, grief , and all the reasons for what they are doing. The story is portrayed in a such way that you will fall for the character. The character aren't made so superficial though they are good for what they do they all have their weakness.
First and second season were the continuation of the same story so it was good. Though they tried to connect the story in third season , it's not quite convincing. Season three was really like it should stop but the season four looks like it is back in track. But i must say it could never match that height of season 1. Huh, I've just finished season 4 and came here to read delightful fan's reviews, but what I get? Just mess of hate!
IN SEQUENCE!
Undoubtedly, seasons 3-4 were less successful then 1st and second! But episodes still were stressful and terrific! Team had got 2 brilliant opponents - Sierra and Gandia. And their opposition was really nervous! Plan was not ideal and it was the main distinction from seasons 1-2 and it was interesting!
Secondly. For everyone, who think that is soap opera! If you wanted jejune cold blooded heist - maybe this show is soap for you! But it has lively and emotional characters who are only humans and can make mistakes!
ALL IN ALL, it is a fantastic show! Part 1 and 2 are really difficult to watch. Story lines are very slow. However part 3 & 4 keeps you engaging. I feel this movie best and won a lot of awards 😍😍 This show is absolutely fantastic. I can't believe it almost only had 2 seasons, thanks to Netflix it got picked up again. It really keeps you on your toes the whole time. Acting and writing are marvelous. Going back and forth between past and present is not confusing in this show, like in some other shows. Do watch it! I loved it. Couldn't believe how good this was. Again this isn't real life. It's just fiction so some of these reviewers bursting a blood vein should really just chill the heck out!<br/><br/>A very intelligent show, entertaining, easy to watch and relatable - exactly whats needed during this lockdown.<br/><br/>I absolutely loved it. Very good production. I usually don't love these kind of tv shows but this one... this one is so good!
I finished the first season in 2 days cause I just couldn't wait to see what was gonna happen.<br/><br/>the only reason why I am not giving its 10 is because the beginning of season 3 was not as good as I wanted it to be but that is me being extremely critical.<br/><br/>the actors are really good and the plot is just so smart. All the charectors have justified their roles. Berlin nailed it and professor no need to tell.few scenes has to cropped to replace with better storyline to make it more engaging . I became addicted from the first episode, the idea of the robbing the way the´re doing seems impossible but finally you say can happen. Good dialogs, high tension, complicated characters. Amazing.<br/><br/>But the series was extremely popular and Netflix bought the rights. What you have got? Crazy, unrealistic ideas, absurd conversations and actions, unreasonable "pc" propaganda, the worst Rambo and John Wick scenes you can imagine (the money was not a problem anymore).<br/><br/>I was keeping on watching the series, respecting the first two seasons were so brilliant, but if you are turning to Season 3, don´t have high expectations.The original seasons (1-2) are brilliant masterpiece. Then Netflix came and killed the show. This series started of as a very engaging and thrilling one. Having lot of twist and turns. There's has been a lot going on in this series which overwhelms you. The pace is also good. Once you start, stopping yourself from binge watching becomes a difficult task. After the second season though things changed a lot. It looked repeatative. After second season creating more series was definitely to do business. La casa da papel, or known by its English name Money Heist, has been impossible to miss, with red jumpsuits and Dalí masks popping up everywhere on social media. It's not surprising then, that it became the most-watched non-English show on Netflix.<br/><br/>Initially, I was sceptical of the show. Would it be just another heist series with a predictable plan and some expected characters? But it turned out to be a little more than that for the creators took a classic heist story and redefined it completely. Yes, there were expected characters but with many unexpected turns to them. The 'Professor' crafted a masterplan not for robbing a bank, but for printing their own money inside Spain's Royal Mint.<br/><br/>It is a quintessential Spanish drama. Rather than the cool, organised and technology-based drama you would expect from let's say, British shows, here, the focus is on the minds and the hearts. It's all about the meticulous planning that has gone behind the heist. To put it simply, it is more passionate and more human.<br/><br/>But what made me love the show was the political theme running not-so-subtly alongside the main narrative. The robbers call themselves the revolution and their red jumpsuits are a clear choice drawn from socialist colours portraying blood and struggle. Even the Dalí masks are not a random choice for Dalí was known to express anti-capitalist sentiments in many artworks. The catchy song, Bella Ciao is a borrowed anthem from Italian protests and the corruption and hypocrisy of government organisations are targeted over and over again throughout the four seasons.<br/><br/>Yes, I agree that the fourth season was not as thrilling, as exhilarating and as entertaining as the first two seasons. If you really just want a quick watch, you can stop after the second season because the second heist seems like a hollow imitation of the first. We miss Berlin even more when he's replaced by his weak replica, Palermo. The Professor loses his charm every time he's defeated by the police and the heist itself seems to be lacking in motive. But if you've been close to the characters like I have, you'll understand that this is not the characters growing weaker-they're simply changing and characters don't always evolve to be stronger versions of themselves but sometimes, just more real ones.<br/><br/>Is it a series worth watching? Absolutely. Is it relevant? Sufficiently. At a time when we are witnessing anti-system protests all over the world and in India, and at a time when these protests seem more necessary than ever before, these revolutionary characters are much more likeable than heartthrobs in rom-coms. If nothing else, you'll end up cheering for the revolution to win and perhaps, longing for a cool, city name for yourself. Story is good. Somewhere it felt like the plan was too much perfect than it should be. What a series, cant wait for the season 5. Leyenda El Professor.<br/><br/>Bella ciao Bella ciao Bella ciao ciao ciao One of the best series I have ever watched!
There are surprises in almost every episode of the series...
All the four seasons are amazing...only the last season I found a bit lacky
But it's worth watching.... The best series after breaking bad.
I love all characters. Personally I agree with the people who call this show a master piece. There is something for everyone, whether it be romance, action, suspense or more. One of the best things about this show is suspense. Almost every single episode ends off with some sort of suspense which pulls you into watching the next episode and then the next and so on. I have seen numerous people who say the plot is very basic and that the show is mediocre but I completely disagree. I do not want to spoil anything but I can say this show is very elaborate and makes it almost feel real with just how good it is. Can't wait till part 5 of the show. To achieve greatness in the series industry you have to keep your audience hooked. Well, this show does this 100%. it is true that seasons 3 and 4 have some "holes" in the plot. Who cares. They are still, pure entertainment! If you are haters who try to find mistakes and have ready a negative review before even watching the show, please watch something else. Don't waste our time... Mone haist is not a season but also a life learner all the carector is awesome this is master piece Amazing!!! Extraordinary!!
Not enough adjectives to describe this piece of art.
It is a must watch. I have watched over a 100 series but never such a gripping one.
This isn't even my genre!!!
I am hooked. Just started the third season and it isn't anything I ever thought it would be.
I am not much of a writer so would just end by saying "Bella Ciao"!!! What an amazing series best i have seen for a long time Check my full review in my Instagram page @ckritique It is one of best thriller series ever made which is getting more exciting as it leans forward.The fourth part started with a suspense where a prime character Nairobi being shot with a sniper and it goes on after it pretty well. Heist could end in only one part ..but it took two .. I love the way of story telling. Such a wonderful tv shows. Waiting for next episodes. It's the best show I've watched in a long time. Adrenaline-pumping, unpredictable, ingenious, philosophical, surrealistic, mind blowing roller coaster ride spiced with passion and dark humor. Can't wait for the 5th season. After getting pass the language barrier and focusing in. This is a great show. Has action and makes you want to binge watch it This web series stands high because of the connect we make with its stars. I can say only one thing that this is the most underrated series of netflix , (suspens , drama , romance , thrill , action , human emotions , such a gripping screenplay , different plot , and last but not the least this series has professor , what can u dream more They wouldn't have killed Berlin so there would be no Palermo I was afraid during the first episode or two that the subtitles not matching and mouths not synchronized with the sounds would distract me from the show. The action and plot twists kept me on my the edge of my seat for the rest of the show. The characters made me hate them and love them so much so that by the end of season 3, I was already fearing the end being near. I fell in love with all of them except 1. Maybe it reaches beyond reality at times but I find reality overrated a great deal of the time. The professor had a new plan for everything. Masterful! Easily one of the best shows ever. Amazing writing, story, and always has you on the edge of your seat...Literally. I loved it. Completed all 4 seasons less than a week. All those characters are great. Some characters are really powerful and anyone will fall in love with those characters. But this series should have ended in S02 with the perfect ending. But still I enjoyed it very much. Now waiting for S05. I hope part 5 is released soon. We were so sad to see Nairobi go...so unexpected. My partner broke a table he was so livid. We cannot wait till 2021 please get part 5 soon. Money Heist Is The Great Web Series. Having a Perfect Action Sequences, Suspense, Emotions And A lotttt of Twist As the Story Goes Further.<br/><br/>Season 1 and 2 are Amazing But Season 3 Gets Slow But Last Ending have a great cliffhanger And Season 4 is Slow In Starting But Gets much better, I Don't know the reason why people are hating season 4 I think season 4 is best in action and in suspense. 04/24/2020 I watched and finished the first two (2) seasons a long time ago and loved watching the characters/actors in it as the storyline played out. When season two ended, I thought that it was also the end of the series and now, just by accident, see that there are two new seasons to watch. I'm looking forward to seeing how this extended bank robbery series plays out? Bon Appetit' The robbers who don't rob the bank for the printing machine, and the robber leader who dates the chief investigator. In order to perfect the perfect crime, the police find clues again and again and are solved by the "Professor". Psychological war, public opinion war, gunfight. Season 1 and Season 2 = Masterful Suspense-filled television,most exciting series Honestly I can't get these bad reviews though I agree that the show could've eneded just after season 2 but come on!! It's thrilling and exciting to watch! I really don't expect anything else from it. It conveys some important messages about the cruppted system though which is well done.
But I loved some of the actings, the thrill and anticipation.
I watched the whole series while quarantined and it just made it a lot easier.
I watched all episodes back to back and I couldn't stop!
Don't be too serious just enjoy!! From the begining yes you will get mad with those character but at the same time what i love is their relationships in the gang. And it becomes bad as Nairobi are not deserved to be executed like that. She should be alive until the end! Don't understand why such writers. I just hoping that seeing Gandia dead but..hmmm. Still follow and obsess with this series until i get the final real ending. Just stop killing good characters because it's sucks. I had never watch series like this its osam it super cool. I am eagerly waitting for the season 5 ....❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ The first two seasons were indeed astonishing. The 3rd and 4th seasons were also very good but it seemed a little repetitive, I believe that the show was to end after the ending of season 2 but it's success made the producers to go on with it. It's very entertaining to watch and the characters have a lot of personality and are very different from eachother.<br/><br/>It is refreshing to see a non american show with this quality. The way of story written and screeplay is just awesome,actors given their best perfomance on the screen❤.I like Berlin character ❤❤ I was basicaly hooked to 4th season.. Yes there is a few lol moments but no problem at all, great camera, great acting you wont sleep while watching this show.. keep up the good work and thanks for show like that! If you dare i would like to see few more seasons with new actions! Best series ever made, next to prison break.. Amazing show, Don't miss this! 10/10! MONEY HEIST : ONE OF THE BEST WEBSERIES I WATCHED IN MY LIFE IS MONEY HEIST.
I BECOME A HUGE FAN OF PROFESSOR. I SPEND 2 DAYS OF 12HRS EACH DAY TO COMPLETE THIS WEBSERIES. NOW WAITING FOR NEXT EPISODES Super series. So different compared To all these happy end series. I absolutely love this show, great acting, amazing characters, and a great story, I honestly just love it:) If you are looking for a good crime thriller, then this is definitely a good pick. Lately, I have not seen anything like it. Great series, dynamic, cheeky. I really love this show. 1-2 seasons are "la bomba", 3-4 are good.
You can't stop watching once you've started.
I love them all. Te amo!!! Despite some surrealistic scenes I find it almost perfect, addictive for me because its uncommon subject plot. Although you are sure that you can predict actions you just not get bored of this series. Actors, soundtrack, title, plot very uncommon compare to all movies made these days. After years, we watch a series full of excitement in great detail , Honestly, I didn't watch the thriller series after prison break and dexter until I came across this series,
I would like to thank all the staff of the creators of this series and as a fan, I ask them to continue the series with excitement and strength as in previous seasons
And I don't understand those who write critical comments at all.... If you are web series lover go for it. It's not killer one as all one says like, Over hyped series. Sometimes it doesnt seems like logic. This show is brilliant and such a massive achievement for the cast and crew. All characters are very precious.. all planning and minor works perfectly worked.. salute the directors and actors.. It will keep u up till morning u don't know whats coming that's what i love about this TV show A lot of people have mixed opinions about seasons three and four but I actually really liked them, although think that they definitely were not as good as the first two. I just wish It played out more smoothly like the first two seasons. They were a little too intense for me and I liked the first two much better but overall this is a amazing show and it has a really good story. Honestly the best thing I've seen in a long time! You love all the characters within the first couple of episodes, you're always on your seat, the suspense is real and no character is expendable ...
As for all the actors I sincerely think they are better than Hollywood! Right now it's the best there is. breathtaking, stunning, unpredictable and One word "Perfect", Just completed the season 03 of much appreciated the heist series But truly one thing for sure I had never seen heist series with love story between either father and son aur between lovers. This series's theme song is all about the love and ruined.
I will not spoiler the plot but one thing for sure the last four episodes of season 2 on their best and will remind for long time and just it is professor who will amaze you with his incredible acting but finally it was Berlin yes it is berlin who will fill up your eyes with tears. and will capable to take all the credit of the series, end of the day you will fall in love with the bad guys. You can't keep your eyes off it, Seasons 1 and 2 are amazing, season 3 i agree the plot is kind of dumb, still good after a couple of episodes.. and seaosn 4 goes back to being amazing! One of my favorite shows of all time.. MAYBE it's a culture thing, some people from countries without passion might find it bad, but it isn't. Its really enjoyable, don't go at what people are screaming regarding 3rd and 4th season, i enjoyed 3rd and 4th season as well. It has pretty decent plot and certainly filled with what one wanted after the end of season 2. Though not great, it's good. Decent acting. Masterpiece music and song. Wow..what a brilliant idea and perfect thrilling setting for a heist. But the love and drama added in between is a real spoiler to the entire theme. So I was with my remote to fast forward the love drama scenes. Was there any Bollywood director involved in it? Oh dance was missing.
But if you take out the love scenes it is a perfect engaging one to watch. I stopped at part 2 end. can't see more of the love drama in part 3 Seasons 1 and 2 were wonderfully executed, and made for a great watch. I'd give a 9/10 for the first seasons, but the last two seasons were so poorly written with the dragging, boring flashbacks and cliché action scenes.<br/><br/>The second season would've ended the show perfectly. The new seasons are very disappointing, and there will most likely be a fifth season judging by the ending of season 4, but I'm not expecting anything other than a stretched out finale for the show. Should have ended in Season 2 only.Netflix intervention ruined this.First robbery was awesome and perfect but the next one is just repetitive and it's just forced content. We can clearly see that in process of making it bigger they have just ruined the heart of the show.Intelligence works great with intuition behind it but utterly fails when just money and fame is behind it. It's become disgusting in season 4. It was good in season 1 & 2. But I Didn't get the hype in the last season. Why you're involving their personal problems in the robbery? So I'm not satisfied with season 4. Undoubtedly season 1&2 was great. 😍 This is a pretty good series i guess.but Netflix bend it too much.well first 2 seasons are just out of the world no doubt.but after it seem's little boaring if we compare with previous. After season 3 i thought it will be end with 4 seasons and it should be.but after season 4 i am little disappointed.Netflix literally ruin this series. Best tv series ever i cant wait for season 5 but i know its gona be a long wait, such cool characters, great script AMAZING YOU WONT BE DISSAPOINTED If I could I would give it a 10 every single day. Maybe for somebody this shows doesn't mean to much but, for me it's just what I need it right now. As I'm going through very difficulties times right now, this show changed something inside me. Made me realize so many things about myself and others and helped me to pick myself up and believe in myself and, also I realized my worth. I know, it might not make sense in what I'm saying but... I just want to say that watching this show brought back to me my old self, the truself. And the Bella Ciao song just hits you to the core. Absolutely Love it. I rated season 1 and 2 10/10.
It was so amazing. I actually finished 2 seasons in one day. I couldn't wait to rate until the end. I watched it after too many hype, I was a little prejudicial at first, but later I understood the hype but it lasted for only 2 seasons. The actors and the musics are one of the best things. In general the first 2 seasons are brilliant and well- thought but the 3rd and 4th seasons are just for the hype. I think it should've ended at the end of the 2nd season but It is definetely worth to watch (especially for the actors/actresses and the music) . I recommend it but don't take your hopes too high for the rest of the series after the first two. Great series very edgy who dunnit type series i hope they get the money iam just on part 2 episode 5 This show is so riveting, you can't stop watching. Every detail is so well thought out. Can't wait for season 5. Cheers for the scriptwriter 🍻 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Good show but it gets real annoying and repetitive, the stupid love story between Tokyo and Rio. They ruin everything in every episode which makes this series a lackluster. The couple's script is too lame, deaths and pain caused by the two couple throughout. This is top tv show of 2020
After prison break this is the 2nd best tv show One of the most thrilling, smart, and unpredictable series i have ever watched. Takes you through emotions, tricks, strategies and mind of people belonging to boths side of the stories<br/><br/>Higly recommended, hugely popular for a reason and a must to watch in your watchlist. I really like the way this series is written but the last episodes of season 3 and 4 disappointed me at the end.i would like to know if we will get the 5th season In fact, it's a left-wing TV play with revolutionary themes. The whole robbery is a big metaphor. The people at the bottom fight against capitalism. The rhythm is great, the narration is proper, the foreshadowing is reasonable, the character is three-dimensional, the fighting wisdom fights bravely. It is a very wonderful story. In love (all characters) except ARTURO
Berlin>professor>Tokio>Raquil>Nairobi>Moscow>Helsinki!!<br/><br/>I loved all seasons but most people Doesn't like
No one can deny that
"it's keeps you on the edge of your seat" Until you don't end it. And it will take time to your mind to get over it, Thats challenge🤙<br/><br/>Vice Versa Superhit Mind-game The idea explored by Money Heist wasnt a new one as heists have been a filmed for decades. However Money Heist portays a robbery plan unlike any other interms of depth of planning.<br/><br/>The filming has been well caried out and the fact that the series has little violence adds to its value for most audiences. However a few items felt like a flaw in the plot and could have been better thought out to help this season categorize as amongst the best in history.<br/><br/>The plot mainly falls short on a few things that sound a bit less logical, the police has far too many resources at hand to deal wih a robbery. In most part of the season professors obsession to pursue relationship with inspector felt unwarranted, especially condiering that it was only ruining some part of this plan every time he met her.<br/><br/>The stunt to return tokyo back into mint sound less logical but could be matched with Tokyo's character.<br/><br/>Apart from minor flaws in plot the series deserves all appreciation for filming and direction. Berlin and Professor deserve recongition for extra ordinary acting. I cant stop watching it. I love everything. The characters, the plot, the complicated relationships, the action, the sentimental moments. I cried, i laughed, i gasped in awe and i loved every single second of it. Denver is by far my favourite character he is flawed but so kind and his laugh... omg his laugh. I can't even.<br/><br/><< slight spoiler>><br/><br/>
If anything happened to him i swear to god id just cry myself to sleep for the next couple of months. Plz dont kill my bae in the nexr season ^^ A heist with an amazing planning. The planning is beyond youe imagination.
I haven't seen any Spanish series but this one is the first and the best Spanish series.The planning of a professor and and heist by his teammates was awesome.
All the characters acts perfectly. The acting, the soundtrack, the cinematography everything was perfect. In every season you will be excited for what will happen next. It was so painful that a character like Nairobi has to leave this wonderful series, but with her befitting burial given to her, am very overwhelmed. Amazingly fantastic The first tv series I ever binge watched. The show is fast packed and action packed. The characters are well defined and you connect with them instantly. The plot and execution of the story line is good. Very hard to miss this one. I was so hung up on the show that I stayed up till 4 AM on a school night to watch Season one and then the other seasons came out And not even a single episode has disappointed me it had me on the edge all the time. you never knew what was going to happen and it's very exciting and and good I give it a 10 out of 10 One of the best series I've ever seen.
I recommend everyone to see it.
you won't regret. I wish Netflix would do more the 8 episodes on a parts the show is great I just watched all episodes in a day in a half and that is because there is only 8 episodes a part I found this Spanish TV series by chance, I really recommend you watch it. It's one of the best series that I have seen lately. A chess game between the police and the robbers, you will be surprised by its development.<br/><br/>Professor gave justice to his role. What a legend. You'll get addicted to the show and you'll start admiring some characters while hating the others. Seriously I got so much involved in the show that I started cursing some of the characters. Who thought a TV series on a money heist will be so interesting. This is not just a series it's an emotion
It's contain surprises events
Also that brilliant Mind of Professor One of the best series I've ever seen in my life shdkslsbrbanndhdhejnakkfknndjdjdnfnr I love this MONEY HEIST ,,,, I'm extremely hard core fan..... I love all characters, professor superb hero, what a director what screenplay,
MY KNEES DOWN AND SALAAM TO YOUR FOOT....
I'M VERY HAPPY TO SEE ALL THIS SERIES
GOD BLESS YOU ALL...
I'M FROM INDIA ( ANDHRA PRADESH) HYDERABAD.... Although I have just watched the first season, but it is very good and keeps you busy. Th character of Professor is PURE GOLD. U will Love it One of the best series if not the best on Netflix right now. Highly recommended. Watch in origin language with subtitles. Best Spanish series ever! Great plot. Excellent characters. Superb acting. It has thrill, emotional connect and a overall completeness. Must watch. These both are extraordinary, they involve loads of thrill, lots of brain and will make you fall in love with the characters. A must watch series in NETFLIX . Although some character like Tokyo irritate
too much but it's absolutely Masterclass . Very tight plot with little loopholes makes it a master class..Better than Breaking Bad anytime..It's addictive .. Money Heist is an amazing show. No one could say otherwise. Every episode was unique and exciting to watch. Season 4 actually had me get up off my seat in excitement! I'm telling all my friends and family about it. Getting them hooked as well. Hope to see another season real soon! Amazing series of minds. I havent watch any series like this since 10 years. The cast names on the basis of cities is so creative. Something best to watch. Best series i ever seen
I love Characters. Story . Everything
LCDP is not a series
Its a part of us ❤❤❤❤ The series was intriguing and very absorbing initially. The mind games between the police and Professor were exciting and wow-inducing. All the meticulous planning that they went through was amazing and kept you on the hooks.<br/><br/>But the parts where they showed infighting between the thieves was way overdone. Everyone was pointing guns at everyone else, and completely botched the beauty and preciseness of the plan...and made the audience cringe.<br/><br/>And Season 3 and 4 overdid all the internal discussions and interactions - there was much less time dedicated to the interaction between the police and thieves. If they could somehow edit out most of the non-heist related planning (example: the wedding scenes with Denver, and the stupid dialogues over lunch, etc), and the stupid infighting during the heist (round robin of "now I am in charge", Arturo scenes, the whole Gandia fighting), those seasons could also have been great.<br/><br/>My recommendation to other viewers - do watch this series as this is probably the best of heist planning you will ever see (better than Mission Impossible movies). Just fast forward meaningless scenes showing personal interactions. U won't feel bore even a minute and it is an excellent one....u wont leave it once u started watching.....perfect for every one...bo matter which genre u r intrested in u will love this... The first 2 seasons start quiet different but amazing in its own way. I kinda disliked some of the romance and characters, especially the tryhard strong independent woman role.<br/><br/>Season 4 was different, completely keeping me on my stupid treadmill for 130 minutes without break. so much tension i couldnt waste a minute doing smth else. At this season the serie shifted to a more aggressive and action style and i rly like that. It's a well thought out story with vast opportunities to explore and have fun with from many angles of the storyline, and the writers don't disappoint, not missing a beat. Heck, they found angles I wouldn't have realized were there! The writing is clever in that it never gives you enough to anticipate anything that might happen next. You honestly can't fathom how a character is going to get out of a particular pickle, and you just sit there waiting for the train to crash and the groan to escape your stomach, but somehow the writers keep it on the track. I look forward to seeing Part 5 . I've also grown very, very fond of all the actors, even those who might not have strong acting skills. Only good writing can compensate for that. Given that all are probably Spanish actors, I'm going to have to look up other things they have done to enjoy them further. All the characters behind doing the heist are fun to watch.<br/><br/>I really like how well the show causes you to at first like one of the key characters, a lot, and then grow to hate them and feel they are disposable, unable to picture their significance to any later episodes except to annoy you, but then ... suddenly, magically, you're liking them again! And even happy that the writers figured out a way to do that. It's as absurd as a few of the scenes and story lines are, but somehow after a groan or two they magically worked, often with a good laugh.<br/><br/>I'm not giving storyline details like other reviews are. I feel that it's best to not know much going in other than the series' description. And the previews on Netflix show scenes from other seasons, which take place in a very different location with a very different angle, so I'm intrigued to reach those parts of the story. The storyline really is something fun to imagine
Part 1 : 8/10
Part 2 : 9/10
Part 3 : 8/10
Part 4 : 7.5/10 The professor - Denver - Helsinki will die in season 5 as the scene of Nairobi in the red dress showed only Berlin-Moscow-Oslo who died in the first 2 seasons Really addictive and full of excitement and actions The plot is amazing, the characters have such great developments and there isn't one boring moment.<br/><br/>The minute season 4 was released I was absolutely hooked. People are complaining about the fact that the heist didn't end in season 4 but I think it gave us much more detail of how even in the most perfect plans things sometimes go the other way.<br/><br/>Gandia is the most annoying character ever but I think he added to the show. This series is just so masterclass.Every episode is full of suspense.It makes you believe as what happening is real and if you were in the shoes of the police you were going to do just what they did.Big Ups to Alex Pina for such a wonderful piece.Cant wait for Season 5. I've watched continuous for long and long and long hours. It is really a great series. All character is superb. I started thinking like professor in any work i do. I ll be having plan what if that goes wrong. OMG !!! professor is really a epic character. In series 4, denvor said i am going for surrender with white hanky outside then at the same time why police didn't enter. Guys can someone help me out here.... Am deadly in love with Nairobi here...oh my God this lady she is killing mere🙆.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

. One of the finest series I have seen. But seriously they couldn't cast anyone other than Ursula for Tokyo. I don't if it was just her character , or she's naturally such a terrible actress. Like seriously everyone does a fine job, but her character and her own performance are absolutely the worst. She alone is the reason that brings down the show many times. I wished Tokyo was dead in the very first episode of S1.
She'll pose unnecessarily, overact everytime she's on screen, her dialogue delivery is the absolute worst, and she holds the gun like a teenager would do, kind of a show off. While every other aspect of the show is class apart, Ursula(Tokyo) is ridiculous both actor and the character. One day I was tempted to see what's new on Netflix. I searched and listed tons of boring, stupid generic series (mostly in 5 categories: teenage school mystery, vampires, zombies, superheroes and drug dealers etc.). Then, suddenly, out of nowhere came some show with short but intrigue name "Money Heist" (and picture of Dali-masked people in red). I didn't know anything about that tv series and thought - another boring stupid Netflix show with amateur directors and wannabe actors, but after only 5 minutes I was deeply dragged into story. Interesting scenario, very lively characters, interesting (natural) dialogues and very well dosed scenes which continue to pull you deeper and turn you in to everhungry tv-zombie who wants only one more episode of "La Casa de Papel" (original name). The first and second season were brilliant, full of energy and well-tempted tempo, but the 3rd and 4th season (parts) are clearly worsen. It is obvious that authors wanted to repeat intense action from previous parts, but most of episodes are pretty generic and screenplay is full of stupidity, also we can see that most actors are actually very bad in their profession (over-acting). Especially bad are "Helsinki" and "Tokyo", she is cute but acting is not for her. But, to keep shocking the viewers they injected "new age" characters like transexual man (although played by woman, because transexual man can never be beautiful like woman, no matter how he try or operate himself) and some men (all are sociopaths in screenplay) who passionately hugging and kissing each other. It is obvious it is commanded from above that every video today, movie or series has to have some nice, very emotional gay/lesbian characters. Personally I don't care for them, but it is became notoriously obvious and it ruins most of shows because it is forced in to. Hope that the 5th part of this show would be the last because there is really nothing more to tell. Story has to be concluded while it is worth. More seasons would devastate it and turn "la Casa" into cheap, repeating spanish soap-opera. Excelente! Sin precedentes... Las actuaciones son formidables... This triller keeps you glued to the TV
Simply amazing Fortunately season 4 is better than 3 and the whole series is saved. I started watching money heist s4 i guess around 9:00 pm and at 4:30 am I finished. I watched consecutively 8 episodes while m so sleepy but attraction of this season didn't allow me to sleep it compel me to keep awakening and watching. I highly recommend to watch The season 4 of money heist starts off with high intensity, after launching missiles to the police where they picked up from the previous season, successfully operating on Nairobi without a surgeon in sight. Then it goes slow, until episode 6 where they amp the energy and release a series of bombastic events. The most shocking of all would be the death of Nairobi. We shouldn't have gotten our hopes up from the trailer when we saw Helsinki tearfully playing a morbid tune on his harmonica. But nonetheless as she survives the surgery all hopes were up, until Ganda shoots her in the head after beating up her fresh surgical wounds and shooting her in the hand. Overall it's a great watch but they could've given her death a little more dignity. I really liked the first 2 seasons, because of unexpected events and unpredictable story lines but now it has become too easy to guess what is going to happen next. Many scenes were unnecessary. La Casa de Papel aka Money Heist Season 4 Short Review(Spoliers till Season 3 ending!!)<br/><br/>If you have not watched this series at all look away now and binge on one of the most addictive series of recent years. Just grab a tub of popcorn and tell your folks you won't be answering any calls for the next 2 days!!
Thank me later!!
**********************
The most popular non-English show on Netflix is back. The 4th part of the show that redefined bank heists with its nerve wracking cat and mouse chases bewteen the mastermind Professor and the Police returns to Netflix amid the global lockdown.
Surprisingly the first few episodes center around the Professor's team lead by Tokyo and Palermo as the Professor comes to terms with the execution of Lisbon in the previous series' finale.
Ego clashes and leadership struggles among the gang mean opportunities for the authorities to gain some foothold into the Bank and these pave way to some surprises both good and bad. A shocking incident galvanizes the gang as the Professor return to the action in the later episodes. From then its the Money Heist action we have become accustomed to with the Professor explaining every small move ahead of execution and executing in impeccable style.The last 2 episodes are a rollercoaster ride leading to yet another Cliffhanger ending. As Netflix pumps more and more money (without having to rob the Central Bank of Spain!) the series is certainly here to stay in Fast and Furious style sans the sexy automobiles. This show is getting cheaper and cheaper................... The heist begins with well defined characters who stick to their persona even as the situation during the heist gets fluid. Season one and two were believable and the characters seemed professionals who fit their roles. However, season 3 is where it all started going wrong. Rigid, lazy and unimagintive writing made the following seasons an overlap of the preceding ones. There characters gave an amateur feeling to the whole scenario and the whole heist started to look ridiculous. Wonderful show.... All the characters are played well A bunch of badly assembled crooks led by a so-called "professor" team up to carry out an improbable billion dollar heist. Slow start but then... excellent plot and you Will love the characters! I really enjoy every moment of the La Casa de Papel!<br/><br/>Every episode is great on its own way.
Many episodes also show the happy and sad moments in the series.<br/><br/>It also is really emotional and you can feel a lot.
I cried many times while watching La Casa de Papel.<br/><br/>But the best thing is, that you can also really talk with the fans who also watch the series.<br/><br/>I talked with so many people about it. We even shared our own theories. I'm very tuff on choosing what to watch, I search for hours and hours, so I don't waste my time. But this ladies and gentleman, this is a masterpiece. I randomly checked it's resume and was like, why not let's give it a check, and the truth is I just ended the series and waiting for season 4.
An amazing set of actors and plot twists. Brilliant directing, acting. The actors perfectly fit their roles, and you get all the hype just watching it. I don't think it's among the best ones but I definitely think it's also not among the worst ones. I'm gonna give a thorough review since I personally liked it a lot although maybe objectively it has a lot of flaws.<br/><br/>The idea of it is very appealing since, it's nothing new and unique, it's more "been there, done that" kind of scenario but they took an old subject and made it into something very interesting.<br/><br/>There are a lot of cliches, I'm a woman myself and I like the presence of strong female characters but in my personal opinion they went there over the line which makes this movie a bit too feminist. The Professor is a cute geek, uncomfortable in that criminal world what makes him seem more like any human being other than some ex war veteran, although he is above average intelligent. The rest of the characters are likeable, every in their own way. I would though ask the Professor why he chose those people for the job since most of them are not particularly smart and I would say they are neither competent nor capable of pulling it off but they probably wanted them to seem like neighborhood guys and gals. I understand that and agree with it but they shouldn't have made them so unstable because most of them are (Tokio is totally unstable and crazy, Rio is an imature, spoiled brath, Denver is good, but pretty stupid, Moscow is also good, but too weak for that kind of job - but we still love them. The rest are less important and the most capable ones are Berlin and Nairobi, with some severe set of flaws, but don't we all have them?)<br/><br/>Season 1 was the best, the plan was perfect, maybe too perfect, Miss inspector was not suitable for the job, she got played big time, the police stupid, but let's say they didn't see it all coming so there's an excuse for all of that. Season 2 as well as Season 1 very interesting, some good lines were to be remembered, some dead characters as well, but generally it would be maybe an 8, but then the 3th Season breaks in and ruins the whole thing.
When you have ex robbers not knowing what to do, they go back to robbing, wow what a surpise.
They have a good reason, which is great, we got the police getting a little tougher, Alicia is spicing things up, what we were dying for but generally Season 3 starts well and ending as a copy-paste of it's ancestors. Sadly.<br/><br/>It's not that bad though, the ending leaves us thinking about the 4th one which is nice. We are hoping that the producers are gonna surprise us this time, but I don't get my hopes up since the whole show has been tragically predictable so far.<br/><br/>This was my objective opinion, the subjective one is that i really like the show, I like the action, I like the caracters, the may not fit in such a tremendous plan but they are there to be humans made out of flash and blood so we're gonna give them a break.<br/><br/>I didn't get bored, I like the romance, I like that the Professor is breaking his own rules, I like that a lot and I like the rebellious idea behind it. I'm all in for the 4th Season. I'll be waiting for it. Let's hope that the crew will make up for some obvious mistakes from past. Netflix recommended it to me and I'm recommending to you. If you want a never ending amazing ride then watch it. A suspenseful plot implacably unfolding, a lot of unexpected twists. Refreshing storyline unlike most other movies or series about bank robberies. Professor gave justice to his role. What a legend. You'll get addicted to the show and you'll start admiring some characters while hating the others. It's not just a movie or a script. It is a wonderful work as a philosophy. There is a great slap in the capitalist system. I was surprised to this series It also have emotional attachment One the nicest TV show. Everything is perfectly controlled ans imaginable.
After Narcos this is the 2nd Spanish tv show watched by Indian people.
I would rather say its a art to make a show like that.
Really appreciate and thanks for making such a wonderful show. Great series totally destroyed by smoking people every singe minute. Awesome is the word enough to explain this show. An extravaganza of thrill, heist, twist, drama moulded in a package for a bigger message - this show deserves to be Netflix's most watched non-English show till date.
The acting is top-notch. The characterisation of each character is fabulous. The screenplay is tight and edgy. It has awesome toe-curling moments.
Overall, a must watch for all lovers. Love the story and the plot. But I hate the childish mistakes... Too bad , could've been so good This series is amazing, fit for any adult audience My number 1 Netflix show. Love it can't wait for part 4 and the supposedly 5th and 6th parts It's absolutely one of those series that forces you to take your laptop to the bathroom after 4-6 hours of non-stop binging only to return to your couch smelling like a sweaty bag of chicken feet.<br/><br/>The underlying socialist philosophy and other subtle symbolism ring well in this one and are supported nicely amid a cast of talented actors, a near perfect plot, captivating cinematography, and sold character development that induces empathy for nearly every character presented in the show. Well, not to mention beautiful Spanish people who speak one of the sexiest languages in the world.<br/><br/>Overall, the writing is simply superb with minor flaws which seem to be more abundant after the Netflix takeover. (In the 3rd season, there's more irrelevant social commentary dialogue that is seemingly due to America's obsessive PC culture)<br/><br/>Finally, I will keep watching until its final part as the first two did such an extraordinary Job of building relationships with the main characters that I refuse to let go. Besides, I have to see if the Professor gets out alive and if Nairobi makes it out of the bank of Spain, right?<br/><br/>PS. It has its flaws but the pros highly outweigh the cons. Alright, so I haven't really watched the show yet but based on what I haven't read so far I'm curious to know why 180K people thought this was a great-to-moderately-meh show. I mean come on let's face it, the show isn't even in English which automatically drops its marketability a few notches, below the waistline if you ask me.
That said, I'm encouraged, if not bewildered, by the fact that there were two seasons that followed. Did the robbers plan other heists? Was it a different cast? Did they explore past heists, real or imagined? I mean so many questions but in this day and age, who has the answers? No more oracles to seek guidance from and all the sages have taken refuge in the mountains.
To be honest, I did try to watch a trailer just before writing this honest review, but then I decided against it. I think we can all agree that the best reviews are the ones who say nothing at all and are backed by zero knowledge of the material.
So to sum up, I hope you didn't totally waste your time reading this. Keep in mind that following an episode of the show in Spanish when you have no clue what that language is all about will take a lot more focus and brain power than reading this review.
At the end of the day it's all about priorities, right? Till next time. SIN DUDA ALGUNA ES UNA DE LA SERIES 1 DE NETFLIX.<br/><br/>ES UNA SERIE CON UN TRAMA Y UN SUSPENSO QUE LA HACE MUY BUENA,
CADA PERSONAJE LE AGREGA UN TOQUE ÚNICO, ES LO QUE LA HACE MUY ENTRETENIDA ,LA SERIE TE ENVUELVE EN ESE SUSPENSO Y ESE TRAMA QUE TE HACE DESEAR VER EL SIGUIENTE CAPITULO Y ASÍ OTRO MAS.<br/><br/>UNO DE LOS PERSONAJE QUE PARA MI A MARCADO MAS LA SERIE
HA SIDO (BERLIN) EL LE A DADO UN ESTILO ÚNICO, CON SU ACTUACIÓN EN EL PRIMER ROBO Y ESO ES LO QUE HACE QUE HAGA FALTA EN EL SEGUNDO ROBO, ME HUBIESE ENCANTADO REALMENTE VER A BERLIN Y A PALERMO HACER ESE ROBO JUNTOS YA QUE LA IDEA ERA DE BERLIN Y PALERMO LE AYUDO A PERFECCIONAR . ESO ES LO QUE ME FUERA GUSTADO PERO
AUN ASÍ ME ENCANTA COMO VA LA SERIE ES REALMENTE UNA DE MIS FAVORITAS Y UNA DE LAS MEJORES SERIE. This is one of best series so far.
Season 1 and 2 are exceptionally good .
Awesome plot , best of cast .you can't sleep till you finished it.
But season 3 was more on emotional side ..
In game of heist this looks unreal .
Looks like bollywood typical serials. If this isn't the best tv show that what would be it...
I have seen all the great shows
GOT BAD stranger things and much more ..
I would say ...Money heist is THE MASTERPIECE....it's the only MASTERPIECE
10/10 in all edges...
The director deserves an Oscar...for sure... I watched breaking bad a few years ago and i could not find any other series like BB. Once i saw the ad of la casa de pepal and through in my watch list. And when i saw its 1st episode I watched the whole 3 seasons in 2 days. It is just incredible 😍This right here is the best piece of art in existence. A monaliza of movies made by a Mozart of writers acted by angels from heaven.
The best ever if not One of the few best series movies I have watched! 🙌🏼🇪🇸🖤🇪🇹💯 Feel bad for not watching it earlier.. I'd give it ++ .. the acting, the story What is series. Actually i did not know about this series until i heard from my friend. Then I thought let's watch couple of episodes. Though it was in spanish, i watched the english version.
But it got me glued to it till the last episode released.
Robbery seemed to 2nd Priority after Ethics. Without hurting hostages, robbing the bank - will give credit to who has wrote this.
Various plans, counter plans - all makes it a really best drama. Something not seen earlier in movies/tv.
Characters portrayed as Tokyo, Nairobi, Rio, Denver really whows desperation, irritation, anger, impatience etc qualities of youth.
Would recommend everyone to check this out. One of the bestest series... Amazing plot, great performances, story, direction.. Everything is just amazing.. What can I say !!! Well it's a game changer ... must see series. It's got everything in it ,love, action , friendship , betrayal and feel good series. I really can't wait for the next series and hope they do many more . Actors and actresses amazing !! It's definitely one for the bucket list ! Best of the best series list. Really professor won the heart. And then this arturo such an piece of $**t. The series on the whole hats off to the director. Amazing storyline..one of the best Netflix webseries just amazing.. Season 1 and 2 is just fabulous 10/10.. Season 3 storyline is not that good but watching your favourite characters again is awesome. love el professor and Berlin ..amazing acting by alvaro morte and pedro alonso.. Just loved it and appreciate the new idea of making it such wonderful series ! Professor is Love ðŸ’– highly recommended. Pls do watch it Best series ever deserves top rated show, plus need 10/10 review in the top Let me start with saying, that even though it has multiple flaws, I am happy that I watched this series.
The story starts perfectly. It presents an extraordinary bank robbery plan, and it gives you action already in first episode. From there, almost every episode ends with a cliff hanger, so they keep your attention untill the very end. But as the story progress, it starts getting more and more flaws.
Maybe a bit typical for spanish series, there are 4 love stories progressing parallel with the main story. So the biggest story flaw in my opinion is, that each of those 4 robbers are ready to compromise the 1 bilion euros heist, for the purpose of love. How sweet, just like the real life, isn't it?
The second flaw is that all the action scenes are like some 80s action movie, where the main characters can't get shot. Well yes they can, but not in the shootout itself. There are bullets flying everywhere, but only narrowly missing them. Only later, when the drama music starts and when there is only one bullet left, that's the one that is going to hit one of them. Don't count this as a spoiler, when you'll hear that musuic accompanied with slow motion, you'll already know what to expect.
Then lets move to the main character, Tokyo. As I see in multiple reviews, I'm not the only one who founds her anoying. She is a rebel type emo girl, perhaps an idol for teenage girls, but up to an age of 15. Her acting is lacking of any facial expressions and her voice, which sadly is narrating the whole story is disturbingly anoying aswell. I cant lie that this was an entertaining show, great actors, great charred building. But i have seen this before in prison break SPOILERS just like prison break first season then it swirls into other things. But in simple great entertaining show, addictive to watch. Amazing masterpiece, with amazing overturns and excellent casting. Cannot wait for the 4th season. Hope that they will produce more seasons. If you start watching you cannot stop until you have finished thw whole seasons. Waiting for season 4....finished 3 season in 3 weeks. But if not a fourth part of this wonderful work would be better It is a very interesting, exciting, well acted series. Because of its length there are holes in the story here & there that doesn't seem realistic But, it's a caper movie that kept me entertained for days. The characters are played perfectly & the planning very well done. My opinion is don't miss it. It should have ended at Season 2. There was no need to make season 3. But I guess the success of first two seasons lured the makers to start Season 3 which was mostly boring except for the last episode.<br/><br/>The first two seasons were simply brilliant and outstanding. I wish this was originally made in English coz watching its dubbed version is no fun either. This is not the kind of show I would normally watch but my mom and sister recommended it and I saw a piece of part 3 which looked interesting. Let's just say I was not ready for it to be soooo good that I had to binge all three seasons in one week. I'm honestly about to rewatch it. It was THAT good. This is easily the best TV show ever created. Perfectly weitten and well executed. AmaZing. Thrilling. Superb One of the best series. Watched it twice, can't wait for season 4. Professor & Inspector will keep you glued to the show. Itzair ItuÃ±o is just awesome. Very nicely scripted twists and turns makes this simple money heist something more than what it looks on surface.
Best binge watching in a while.
Best character- professor! You ll not believe, i could not go long with game of throne trying that to be my first season. But this is something extraordinary. Loved this with heart. Extraordinary acting and a great story line. A must watch Just amazing show, it has a all in classic movie, sex, hate , love and revenge!!!! I have watched various TV series on crime but this one ,which make you anxious about next move what it would be .the characters are very perfect .I love one which is called professor.he played beyond critic .storyline is as good as perfermoance.i have watched all the episodes continuously till I found it ended .so here I am waiting for next season . In first season, especially in first episodes, it gets boring but after they start to action, it turn out to be a masterpiece of heist!<br/><br/>1) Professor is the best character in series. He play very good and inherently.<br/><br/>2) Plot is fastmoving and sometimes you really think they get busted. However, it amazes you after every scene and this adds excitement to it.<br/><br/>3) Sex scenes, dirty talk and LGBT characters are not necessary. Actually, they are surplus. But you know Netflix, they always come up with these things.<br/><br/>4) I think they missed the opportunity to become most favorable TV series of all times because the reason I've commented above.<br/><br/>5) I know they will continue to make more seasons because it is popular and the TV series which was thought to be just 2 season will be ruined with hasty plot. Because in third season, it started to losing good points it had in first and second season.<br/><br/>6) Tokyo character is ruining everything and she is irritating. I don't exactly understand why people love her. I'm so much addicted to this series. Love all the twists and turns. The direction of storytelling is so damn strong which makes me fall in love with all the characters. Best serial ever by Netflix. Can not wait for the fourth season. Very interesting plot,very good performances but not a crime drama as it is described!If someone expects something like this and has watched other crime drama series-like The Wire or Breaking Bad-he/she will feel that the series are stupid with so much absence of realism(the inspector Rachel takes her two-days boyfriend with her at the scene of the crime??and so many other completely unreasonable things but I don't want to write about them,you will find them on your own)but the truth is that this IS NOT exactly a crime drama.This a tv series belonging to Magic Realism.Have you ever read Gabriel Garcia Markez??If yes you understand what I mean but this time it isn't a book or a novel but a tv show.If you have never read this kind of littterature I have to tell you that this is fantastic!Many unreasonable things and exaggerations are presented as reality...From this point of view this is an excellent tv series which makes me laugh many times with all these emotional dialogues,with all this absence of logic but also it makes me cry since I liked so much the heroes and I can"feel"them.
So enjoy it as it is.The first Tv series of Magic Realism,this excellent Spanish kind of literature is now on our screens! :) I love everything about this show. It's serious, but is funny when it has to be, and the characters are great as wel. I freaking love this show all the actors did such a incredibly good job!! I truly enjoyed Tokyo..... IG Chrisdeown This is definitely a must watch series.This series has got a great potential.It is well planned and the intelligence of the Mastermind is definitely admirable.. First of all: if you expect La Casa de Papel to be a well-crafted, logical and consistent story about a money heist, you're going to be sorely disappointed. The inconsistencies and plot are wide enough to drive a truck through. To mention but a few:
<ul><li>Why would anyone even want to have one billion or whatever Euro's in CASH? Wouldn't there be a huge problem with laundering all that money? (This is a recurrent issue in Breaking Bad, for instance, where they're constantly struggling with the problem of what to do with all that cash)</li><li>How likely is it that the leader of the heist, the 'Professor' gets into a relationship with the lead investigator Raquel Murillo?</li><li>One might assume that in a hostage situation such as this, the headquarters of the police and investigators would be extremely well-guarded. So why is Raquel so sloppy where access to these headquarters is concerned, letting her boyfriend, i.e. the Professor (okay, she doesn't know yet that he IS the Professor, but one would expect the security to apply to everyone) who actually masterminded the heist and the hostage taking, wander around these headquarters and take a good look at everything and everybody?</li><li>The scene in which Tokyo vaults back on a motorcycle into the building of the Spanish Mint where the other robbers, while at least twenty policeman are trying to shoot her, is one of the most unlikely I have ever seen.....</li></ul>And I could go on and on.....<br/><br/>So, in spite of all these issues, and many, many others, why still the fairly high rating? Well, as I said at the beginning, if you want to see this as a story about a heist, which it purports to be, you're not going to get it. You could say - if you want to look at it in a philosophical way, that this story is really about the human condition. Because after all, what do humans do? They love, they hate, they make love, they try to kill each (and sometimes actually do), they do crazy, stupid, impulsive and irrational things. All this happens at La Casa de Papel. What makes it so convincing is that the actors are, on the whole, excellent. With a few exceptions: I wasn't too crazy about Tokyo, she actually grew more any more annoying as the series went on. Also, the love story between her and Rio didn't really convince me. But almost all the others were great. So real, like people you meet in everyday life. First of all the Professor. Very real, very convincing and consistent. Unworldly and clumsy, but also smart and kind, and driven by an ideal and a vision (no matter how unrealistic). Raquel was convincing too, I thought, as a somewhat stressed-out and overworked woman, and the chemistry between her and the Professor was believable. I also liked Nairobi, great woman, very strong and feisty! And the father-son pair of Denver and Moscow worked well, the affection between them felt real and relatable.
And last but not least: Berlin. Wow. Just wow. At first I thought he was a creep, and then, a psychopath. And then - I just loved him. I have never before seen an actor who was able to display such a range of emotions and characteristics, from viciousness, aggression, arrogance and cynicism to humor, vulnerability, sadness, pain, melancholy and idealism, and make it work. Incredible. And what a pity he won't be around for Season 3 (which I haven't watched yet). On the other hand - given the many unlikely plot twists which went before, maybe they could bring him back? Please? Pleeeaaasse??<br/><br/>Anyway, summarizing: my advice when watching this series would be not to worry too much about the plot, but just to sit back and enjoy the ride! Powerful series. Watch it now. Awesome Story.I started this series thinking that it would be like other robbery Shows but it was totally different. It have every genre in it Written perfectly. Keeps you at the edge of your seat with it's brilliantly written storyline By the time you will be watching last few minutes of 13th episode of season 1 you will be singing "Bella Ciao" along with Professor & Berlin.<br/><br/>
Money heist is exceptional, top notch performance through out in every department. A big mistake that leads the series is that in s01e12 raquels mother listens to angels message in which hi clearly states salva's name but rather in next episode when salva introduces himself to her mother at the door she invites him in like no clues whatsoever ðŸ‘€ My headline says what and how this show is. With fast moving story, lot of twists and turns make you not to turn of the device. Hats off to the writer and it is executed so well. The only show that I liked after The Breaking Bad. For God sake they should release 4th season early, I'm eagerly waiting. Actually it was 7.5 but IMDb does not allow point so 7. Season 1 and 2 was very fabulous but season 3 has quite disappointed me that's why i cut the ratings. Story and thrill that was created at its best. The series has taught us the possible best consequences of any event and how would we deal with it if that happens. Professor's acting was very nice. I wanted more some explanation to their plan instead action.<br/><br/>Some of you wrote that something should not have been happened but whole series was a fantasy so we can not doubt that what and why that has been done by them untill unless logic is concerned. And all people thinks in a different way.<br/><br/>One of the fabulous fantasy thiller web series. Worth watching. And highly recommended because of first and second seasons. Absolutely fantastic series. This is up amongst with the best series I've ever seen. Really good casting and I fell in love with all the characters. A great combination of thrilling, funny and totally engaging with a clever storyline that doesn't insult your intelligence. In Netflix's part 1 and part 2, there were so many new and great stuff with amazingly creative ideas. In part 3, there are almost no such thing that we can sort as "new and creative". Yes, I liked this part too but first ones were better. Also, Im excited for part 4 because everything about series may proof that part 4 is coming. Great characters, great story, great atmosphere... It is worth to see it. I loved the series from the first episode, but i belive the third season should had a more dramatic ending, it looked like just the beginning of the next season Part # 3<br/><br/>Did not strike a natural turn of events.The characters seemed slow in their actions.At times the action was not as in Part 1&2.There were moments you felt they were trying hard.Perhaps the TV series could have just terminated the entire show with Part 1 & 2.
Seemed a little unreal.The English subtitles were exaggerated & did not synchronise in some places
After a long wait for the Part 3 this was little disappointing.I hope the Part 4 is a shade different.<br/><br/>I would rate this as one of the fines TV series I had seen & which brought me closer to NETFLIX.. This tv serie has an exciting trama and is full of twist. I enjoyed watch this tv serie! Just Saw inside man. (2006) compare. Ache. Akward. Copycat? Sew them? I found this series to be a modern Spaghetti Western.
They have done a better job of matching the voices to the movement of the mouth but I found the sound quality is still not up to par. It's still another basic movie about a heist, it's just drawn out more. I want to watch movie here but its only trailer pictures why..? What a beginning! Great plot, interesting characters and a strong feel of authenticity. Then it just got so diluted in the second season that I started appreciating the 10 second forward button more and more. Script writing must be under paid in Spain as well. But I guess it's harder than I know to construct a story for this many episodes. The list of stupidity is too long. One example when you bleed to death your pulse is not slowing down. It races, but get weaker and you could at least put some makeup on, so he really is ''as white as the snow in Stalingrad''. But maybe it's the translation to Swedish? Good show that always kept me interested.<br/><br/>The problem for me was that there weren't any long term plans going on. For example, the Hostage revolution; Very simple plan that gets shut down in the next episode. Cop finds out who the professor is; Cop has a car crash and falls into a comma. Inspector finds out about the professor; She's in love with him and lets him go.<br/><br/>The only long term plan is the heist of course. But again it's presented in the same way. By answering every problem with a flashback showing that it was part of the plan. That is kind of cool at the same time, but you don't get the feeling that a major operation is going on, but rather that there is a mini problem solved in each episode.<br/><br/>One of the things that I also didn't like were plot twists. I feel like they were either expected or forced. The inspector falls in love with the professor and turns to his side. Not really shocking. The blond chick falls in love with Denver AND picks up the M-16 to shoot the police officers? Too much.<br/><br/>Also too much drama during the heist. I can get behind the thieves arguing a couple of times during the week they were in the building, but in this show people were pointing guns at each others heads at the end of every episode and were fine at the beginning of the next. It got tiring.<br/><br/>Never lost interest though. Good show. It's the same story as the American movie inside man Very good plot. But production and acting could use some Hollywood skillsets. It has a good plot and all but on the other hand, it's got almost all known crime genre ClichÃ© and it feels though the script is written so that they could fit in properly those clichÃ©s to fit the plot. I didn't feel any connection with the character and didn't care if they lived or died. it's too focused on Tokyo and doesn't let space to show the complexity of the other characters. too summer it all up, this show is just another crime show that tries to seem sophisticated and fails to do so. The concept is good (the idea and the characters) but the execution is bad, this could be summarized in a movie or a mini-series and it would have been better. It's pretentious, and some elements or scenes are copies of other series. The worst part is that the details do not make sense. You start to hate some of the characters because they are so badly written(they are too dumb!!!!!) and some of them can't act, there is no transformation of them and if there is, there is no consistency. The sound mixing is repetitive and several times unnecessary. Is what this series is. And it is beautiful, in its almost childish naivety which some mistake for lack of skill and logical inconsistencies. Yes, some plot points are ludicrous, the first of which is the basic premise of the series, that it is really possible to rob la Casa de Papel. It is not, otherwise it would have been done in real life and we would know about it. In my opinion, this series is not about a heist. It is about the underprivileged, downtrodden and losers entering the place where money is printed to reveal us that it is essentially what it is called in Spanish - A house of paper. And to show us what they are in their essence - just people who crave for love. Those whose intellect is above such shallowness, seeing only plot holes and cheap melodrama, please explain how on Earth could, for example, Jesse Pinkman phone Walter White and vice versa without getting them both caught? There was no triangulation in Albuquerque? The first time we see the real Heisenberg, when he blows up Tucos headquarters, the series has seriously jumped the shark as both of them are alive and WW gets away with it. The methalamine which was on the train robbed in the best tv series in history and around here, is easily made at home. Does that make BB a bad series? Of course not. The richness of the characters, ethical ambiguity and eternal themes it addresses compensate for minor flaws of the plot. La Casa de Papel does not pretend to be as serious as BB, but it does have a message. A truly humane one. And as subtle and subversive as Bella Ciao. It is the reason why people love this series and come here to recommend it to others. Not because they are paid. Money is paper, after all. Even Walter White had to acknowledge that fact in the end. This tv show could attract a lot of no-tv show addicts. thats the biggest positive thing about it. but for me its really overrated Let me start by saying that I was loving this series a lot until about episode 5 of part 2 (on the Netflix cut of the episodes). There were problems with the plot before that like, for example, how an entire police force be so inept ? But you can accept some of these because, hey, it's a movie. 
But when Raquel realizes her lover is the professor and decides not to arrest him, the whole credibility of the series falls apart. And then she sinks lower and lower in stupidity until the very end. All while the inept police force doesn't arrest her and she is not even prosecuted for her crime of lettting the robbers get away. 
Add to this the fact that Tokyo manages to escape and come back to the mint. Two quite impossible feats.
The insane gun fights in the mint near the end where, again, the professional police SWAT team can seem to hit half protected robbers with a single bullet.
And the ending which glorifies the criminal acts that these robbers made instead of putting them in jail were they belong.
So my rating went from 10 after part 1 to close to 0 at the end. But I still gave it a 6 overall because of the great first part and the fact that I might be affected negatively by the fact that they weren't arrrested. A story about brains war. It goes like ''oh i know you would do that so i did that, but i will act like i was caught unprepared so people will have to keep watching it.'' It gets more and more cliche every episode. One of the worst finales ever. A very interesting series, with an original premise that is worn out with the passage of episodes. I mean, the series is too long for the story you want to tell and has chapters that are too slow or filling.
Even all this, I think a very new bet antenna 3, which as you are seeing this devastating Netflix. This is the type of show you can zone out and watch for pure entertainment. It's just so fake and difficult to believe that it's more like a fantasy movie. Who believes that a country's (Spain) national mint has 4 cops guarding it and no one responding to a robbery for 10 hours? The federal reserve in NYC has about 200 armed security and thousands more within a mile.<br/><br/>This show also gets to me because they are trying too hard to be "cool" and pretending to be a hollywood movie and it comes across as just lame. For example, a bunch of cops hanging out near a forensics scene - nowhere near a dangerous area - will be wearing full protective gear and black helmets in order to look cool. A bunch of cops inside a tent will hear "Alright, let's get ready to go in" and they'll unlock the safety on their rifles with a loud click for dramatic effect. It's ridiculous. Like so many TV shows with a core high concept, once it gets into its stride it ties itself into so many logical knots and procedural dead ends that it eventually loses itself in its own complexity. The set up in the first few episodes, inter-cutting the planning and the execution of the plan , works very well, but then the plot depends on the professor being incredibly lucky, and the police exceptionally stupid Much of his plan revolves around the police following their internal procedures to the letter - except of course for when the plot demands that they behave irresponsibly and do not. Sure, let's allow a stranger into the HQ, or to enter a crime scene without protective clothing? Let's drink alcohol on duty, let's not have a clear line f command for when he boss is off to rest or have sex. Let's spend so long suspecting the existence of a human mole but not try to identify them, rather than suspect the existence of a bug? <br/><br/>Why did the professor's lessons not include anything about keeping his team's spirits together anticipating that they would start to argue, and make serous mistakes - apart from the few that are part of his plan?<br/><br/>As a two hour film or maybe a 6-episode series this could have been truly great but the knots it ties itself into by multiplying the twists are just too much to get out of.<br/><br/>Oh, and for such a mastermind with all the disguises, how come the professor only has one pair of fairly distinctively unfashionable glasses, and keeps his very identifiable beard? That annoyed me from the very beginning.<br/><br/>That said, the series did pull me in very effectively and Ienjoyed wasting my time in its company. The first season really hooked me with a very impressive idea for the perfect heist. <br/><br/>However season two really fell apart. It was almost as if a different production crew took over. Way too much emotion, drama, love etc. <br/><br/>The ending is not only awful, but totally unrealistic. There is no way some of the stupid decisions made by the police would actually happen, and no explanation is given as to how one of the key characters just walked away. <br/><br/>Worth watching, great cast, but just a train wreck of an ending. Ira an increadible serie but arriba the end i feel that the story is incunclude Enjoyable at first, but then too many inconsistencies and unrealistic events/behaviours slip through the scenario and it becomes harder to get immersed since it doesn't sound real at all. Actually isn't in Toledo (Spain)
It is in Torrelodones, a small town 15 miles north from Madrid (Spain)
The real name of the country house is Finca El Gasco
It can be checked in Instagram because the owners rent the house for weddings, events, film location, etc. I liked it but it Didn't brought anything new to the table Having viewed both seasons. - season 2 much more catchy and well developed than the first one, my review is that this series intends to be a powerfull love statement.of course the robbery is what appeals and intrigues everyone but I see it as secondary 
We have father son love between Sergio and his father as he is the one who fulfills his father lifetime plan and also between Moscow and Denver which is a sacrificing love. Also sacrificing love is the one between brothers. I am speaking about the powerfull connection between Sergio and Andres. 
Andres is my favourite character as he shows multiple layers to his personality and the actor is briliant. The last scene with him and the dialogue with sergio is absolutely wonderful and the music is just perfect.
Beside the love for his father he trully has a love for the weakests, for the repressed, as well as Sergio. Their idea was not to get rich for the sake of being rich but to give the world a robin hood feeling, stealing from the rich and so on. The rich being the capitalist society ruled by bankers.
What gives soul to this series and the reason why you cannot quit it even though there are many loopholes that get on your nerve are the love stories. 
Monica and denver is the unforseen love but in 5 days it has everything From hate to love and sex and friendship
Rio and tokio have a disfunctional relationship toxical at some points but nontheless enjoyable 
Season 2 is most about sergio and rachel. The actors deliver the perfect tensional love hate relation
About the theft. Yes there are manyyy many errors related to the techical aspects or the storyline, the scrips that seems stupid or just funny if you view them a bit relaxed but there are also some nice turnarounds events. some more plausable than other, that do the trick and make you want to see more.
My conclusion after this loong review is that the directos do a good job at depicting the characters and thier relations and a mediocre job at the actions that surrounds them, from where the major flaws come from. This TV serie deserves a good 7 for its good visuals...But it lacks on the poor script and their surealistic and unpredictable characters. There is no way they could be professional robbers !!! Adoro e recomendo! Grande sÃ©rie, grande elenco! Muito surpreendente The Story is fine and the actors as well, but some facts are not believable. 
The police woman's mother is missing her memory and the daughter living with her do not realises it, but and unknown man notices in 10 minutes, 
The perfect Profesor keeps everything under control but decided to play the cat and the mouse with the Inspector, really??? I want more of series like that 
wow 
its very very very perfect 
just dont know what to say else
