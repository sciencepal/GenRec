When I started watching Mad Men, the rhythm of it felt slow.<br/><br/>Pretty quickly did I realize how much more powerful the slow story & plot development rhythm would be, allowing us to discover the characters, mostly in seasons 1 and 2, and then really be in the thick of it in subsequent seasons.<br/><br/>Indeed, this series has pushed character development so far that they are the entire and only reason why this series is interesting. The actual events happening at the advertising agency is a pretext to throw more things at those characters and have them deal with it. In fact, the characters are so interesting that there is practically no violence needed (except a few minor events) over 7 seasons to keep this series going. I find that tremendously respectable to be able to craft a series in this way, not using gun shots and bombs to make it lively.<br/><br/>Finally, I have not lived in the early 60's time period the series is set in, but I can only say that it's all seemed to me very interesting and all these "vintinge" props and costumes, hair style and such made it all the more fascinating to watch.<br/><br/>Absolutely great work. The brilliance is all in the subtext. There are many hilarious moments that are only funny if you've been paying attention and understand where the character is coming from. There are also many tragic moments that would pass you by if you didn't know what came before. Many lines have double or even triple meanings. Watch this from the beginning, with a friend. Believe me, you will want to discuss each episode afterward to figure out some of the nuances of what happened.<br/><br/>The main Mad Man is the confident womanizer Don Draper, who is head of the Creative department at a mid-sized ad agency in 1960s Madison Avenue. I admit, at first I kind of hated him, but as the viewer learns more about him and his past, I learned to - not love him exactly - but like him and want to watch him endlessly. He is a complicated character who can be a very good man, but also a very bad man.<br/><br/>Don Draper is joined by a rich cast of supporting characters, many of whom deserve a show of their own: The ambitious young Campbell who is utterly sleazy most of the time, but has occasional moments of growth and even cuteness.Peggy Olson starts out as Draper's secretary, but her growth into a strong, confident woman mirrors what is happening for Woman in the 60's. Silver fox Stirling - he may be morally bankrupt but gets some of the best lines. I could go on . . .<br/><br/>The 60's clothes, hairstyles, decor, and current events provide an interesting backdrop for what is essentially a character piece. The setting provides both the occasional laugh (cigarettes being advertised as "healthy") and the more than occasional cringe (how could dumping trash from a picnic in the park right on the grass ever seem okay?!).<br/><br/>If you need fast-paced action or a laugh track, this definitely isn't the show for you. But, if you like character development and subtlety in your television shows, rent the first seasons on DVD and settle in. You won't regret it. I only started watching Mad Man since it's available on Netflix, and I'm very happy I did. My most favourite serie ever - and I have a feeling it will remain that for a very long time. Apart from the spectacular 60's decors and the non predictable story lines, it's the topics and the development of the main characters that is showed in such a refined way, that I couldn't stop watching it. It is done so sophisticatedly, that the whole show has become one big pyschlogy lesson for me. One that offered me answers I was looking for. :) I'll be the first to admit that Mad Men is a show about watching people go to work and live their lives. It should be dull and uninteresting, yet somehow it managed to grip me for a whole 7 seasons and left me wanting more.<br/><br/>The setting is a big part of it. The historical interest of the time (JFK's assassination, the moon landing, England winning the World Cup, to name a few key points in the show) is enough to keep many gripped. It's more than that though. The characters in themselves are worth following and you get invested in them as the seasons progress.<br/><br/>To be frank I didn't like the first season. I just didn't get the formula and was getting close to giving up on the show. I'm glad I didn't though as it only improves from the second season onward. As it stands now, yes. Mad Men is the best TV drama of all-time.<br/><br/>Matthew Weiner's concept alone puts it into a must-try category. Those who have seen every episode in sequence, experience a level of quality TV that sets the bar to the top.<br/><br/>Matthew takes viewers on a high ball roller coaster of human experiences that explore pursuit of bliss, the depths of where one can go, and the winding roads of inner angst one must often travel.<br/><br/>The journey is a most interesting one in Don Draper's universe that occupies a time (1960s) in American culture when changes occurred in warp speed.<br/><br/>No Pollyanna view of the world, Mad Men explores the full spectrum of human relationships and personality types.<br/><br/>View Mad Men from episode one season one if you haven't already. The trip is worth the time.<br/><br/>My vote for Best TV Drama of All Time This is a perfect show in every sense. The opening credits & animated intro are themselves works of art, and the creative direction makes the series so visually exquisite that you can't take your eyes off the screen even for a moment lest you miss one of the many perfect vignettes. The haunting opening music sets the stage for masterful sound design, ranging from each episode's musical selections to the subtlest of ambient sounds. The camera-work is nothing short of stunning; it loves each character and makes even the background action interesting. Talented cast and every character is watchable & believable.<br/><br/>For a period piece, 'Mad Men' is remarkably fresh. The show is set in 1960, following a decade of post-WWII recovery which, with the help of rampant consumerism, transformed America from an industrial society into a "leisure society". One of the most rewarding things about the show is how we get to witness the many cracks which had already begun to form in the manicured facade of the '50s, slowly making way for America's rebellion against the manufactured "good life", and resulting in the social & political upheaval of the 1960s and 1970s.<br/><br/>We get to have intimate glimpses into the various components of this process--money, power, politics, sex, race, gender roles-- in a way that makes us feel as if we're actually there in the room with the characters. The show also does a magnificent job of portraying the simultaneous liberation and objectification of women as consumerism rapidly transformed their role in society.<br/><br/>Each and every well-developed character on this show takes his/her turn to unfold in delicate layers. This unfolding is done with pin-point precision and subtlety, and without ever spoon-feeding us. And every new nugget of information is a highly relevant piece of this very addictive puzzle.<br/><br/>~NN Just finished the finale. My husband & I watched this over the last few months. I felt like I was reading a book. Character development, story lines, sets, period pieces, costume & design, acting, writing, all top notch. I will miss this show. I may have to rewatch again some time! So good. Mad Men is one of the best-written and most ambitious TV shows in some  time. It is worth close study, not just for learning how to create a  well-structured show but also how to write one that is truly original  and potentially groundbreaking.  Story world, or arena, is one of the key structural elements in any TV  drama (see the TV Drama Class for how to create this element, as well  as the other essential structural elements of a successful show). It is  where the story takes place and it usually exists within some specific  arena that not only delineates a recognizable unit but also has a set  of rules, activities and values that defines the characters.  One of the strengths of Mad Men is its story world. Instead of the  usual arena of cops, lawyers, or doctors, Mad Men takes us into a  Manhattan advertising agency in 1960. Besides being totally unique in  TV, this story world is extremely detailed. And the detailing isn't  simply a matter of the set design, which is fabulous. It is written  into every episode. The writers weave all manner of cultural icons of  the late 50s-early 60s, including TV shows, ads, and fashion.  This has two great advantages. One is the pleasure of recognition. If  you were a kid at that time, as I was, the show is a virtual time  machine. And even if you weren't, the authenticity and texture immerse  you in the world and make you feel that "You are there!" The other  great advantage is that this past world tricks the audience into  believing that this is how it really was back then. The first thing we  notice when we see all of these details is how much the world has  changed. Everybody smoked back then. The men were in charge and the  women were all secretaries and housewives. That sets up the kicker. By  first thinking how much we've changed, we then realize, with even more  impact, all the ways we haven't. This story, set in 1960, is really  about today, or more exactly, the ways that human nature only puts on a  new skin and the same fundamental challenges of creating a meaningful  life must be faced by each of us, every moment of every day.  Another structural element that immediately jumps out at you if you  want to create a TV show or write for one is the desire line. In Mad  Men the desire that structures each episode is fairly nebulous, and  that's probably going to cut into the show's popularity (I hope I'm  wrong on this one). Desire is the main reason almost all TV shows are  set in the cop, lawyer, and doctor arenas. These jobs give their shows  a simple and repeatable desire line that tracks the episode every week.  Catch the criminal. Win the case. Save the life. But of course this is  extremely limiting. Most people don't spend their daily lives solving  crimes, prosecuting bad guys, and saving lives.  So while the desire line on this show may be more nebulous, it is far  closer to what most Americans do in their daily lives. These Mad Men  are in the business of selling, which, as Arthur Miller pointed out  long ago, is the archetypal American action. But they aren't selling a  particular product. They're selling desire, some image of the good life  that, because it is a fabricated ideal, is always just out of reach.  Writer Matthew Weiner's brilliant conception for this show is to  connect the selling of desire to America to the personal and work lives  of the ad men themselves. The ad men want the image of the good life in  America that they are selling to be true, even if they intellectually  make fun of the poor suckers out there who buy it. Main character Don  Draper is handsome and talented, with a beautiful wife and two cute  little kids. But he has some secrets he's keeping  like a mistress in  the city  and he feels a terrible void he has no idea how to shake.  Draper is a master at manipulating desire and creating facades, so when  he tries to live the promise for real, the "good life" falls apart in  his hands.  We are in Far from Heaven and American Beauty territory here. And the  second episode even had Draper give his own version of the  Existentialist credo of Sartre and Camus that was seeping into pop  culture during the late 50s (how's that for a sweet detail on a TV  show?). We'll have to see whether Mad Men can extend beyond a few  episodes without imploding. Besides the lack of a clean desire line,  the subject of hollow suburban existence will make it extremely  difficult for the writers to develop the show over the long term  without beating a spiritually dead horse. In the meantime, I'm going to  sit back and enjoy some great dramatic writing, and nowadays TV is the  only place you'll find it. Mad Men is such a fantastic show that is as good as everyone says it is. There's a reason it won so many awards when it was on...because it's great! The acting, directing, attention to detail, etc is all among the best in television history! It starts off a little slow but give it a few episodes because it absolutely pays off! I also am utterly bemused to see so many negative comments on this show. I haven't taken to a TV drama so much since 'Our Friends in the North' (UK only I think) For those who seem to think the show is about pointing out the improved morals of the 21st century, or don't catch the story lines as being evolved enough, or think the characters shallow - I'm afraid you're missing the (beautifully painted) picture completely.<br/><br/>Mad Men oozes. It oozes class, style, sophistication, cinematic production, dreaminess and the wow factor. It seeps into your mind. It doesn't leave you alone, lingering around the corners of your mind for hours afterwards.<br/><br/>As a bonus (as if all this wasn't enough) you've got Don Draper (Jon Hamm). If there's a better cast character, being better acted elsewhere on television in the 21st century then I missed it. The fact that Don is also, or used to be Dick, just adds to the dreaminess.<br/><br/>It's gorgeous, just enjoy. I must admit I'm more likely to be shocked how many users find this drama dull.I remember the night I had the chance to gaze at one of episodes for couple of minutes.Betty posing for a coke ad didn't seem charming or appealing to me at all, I changed the channel...<br/><br/>Long after the series won the Emmies, beautiful tunes of David Carnobora buzzed into my ear via commercials and I thought I might have to get the complete DVD.<br/><br/>HBO absolutely made their worst business move maybe in their history by dissing this show.Cos Made Men is clever, cool, charismatic, sexy but more over it's targeting the audience HBO has created over years.Not random Americans who switch between Idol, a weirdo doctors unpleasant patients who will recover thanks to him or ugly police officers digging a carpet for a strand to discover a guy who you already know committed a homicide.<br/><br/>OK lemme tell you about why I adore this show.Mad Men is ultimately written by people who has a giant caliber of creativity and talent.This show demands the audience to be careful, tedious, curious about what they are watching.This show is not to be figured out in a single episode.After I completed season one I had some feeling towards what Weiner had in his mind while pitching the series to channel executives.Do not let the name fool you, Mad Men is not about ad- business or copywriters, show merely talks about ads, even when they are doing an ad.It is about America, how America transferred itself -and the world which depended on it- through out the sixties.In which manners capitalism can market itself with big lies.<br/><br/>By showing us the differences between 60's and 2000's series easily projects ideas about our time during a past decade.Characters in the show are so real, then I mean not just protagonist Don Draper, every other big, tiny or one time characters gets his/her time on screen and therefore show builds up a magnificent universe which you believe it exits and roam safely.Mad Men is not show yelling or speaking out loud, it politely whispers...We the audience witness a group of peoples lives in NYC, Matthew Weiner cleverly puts mile stone political, social events of USA balanced with everyday life of people as well, balanced fastidiously.The one biggest disappointing down side of Mad Men is that there are almost zero on-location shootings.We never get to see the - city- or anything else.This gives the feeling of being locked in sometimes for the viewer.Cast is totally cool and sexy with their superb retro wardrobe.Jon Hamm is the perfect choice for a lead, January Jones is so sexy that you can't get her out of your mind.Smokey, brownish production design is sweet and elegant.Also soundtrack selecting is so much joyful.<br/><br/>I can't say Mad Men is an easy chew.You have to be patient also alert.As I sad you can get a clear feeling only after watching an entire season.Do you want to watch the same TV shows over seasons or want some fun, intelligent brain gymnastics ? The codes of Mad Men are there to decode for your own sake.Do not miss it... I'm going to be honest. When I first started watching this I said no way am I going to get through even half of it. It seemed boring. But I did and it was very worth it! And it was definitely not boring. You get to know the characters, the memories and you actually miss them when they're gone. This show made me understand that life is short, you can plan out your whole next year and everything go great just the way you want it but everything has an end. I did not like Betty most of the show but in the end I found I actually really did like her. Looking back when she was being cheated on she never knew how her life would end up. I cried. I was happy for Peggy, perfect match. Also you hate Don's decisions most of the show but also feel bad for him? Hope he has positive outcomes? Idk but terrific show. So many things I can talk about. Great actors/actresses. And they fit into the 50s,60s perfectly. Also on a side note the food in that show always looked so appetizing!! Loved it!! Let me start by saying the first time I watched Mad Men I found it slow. I gave up after a few episodes. I gave it a go few years later when I was more mature and loved every moment. This is one of the best shows in the modern era. Ironically it is about a different time in history.<br/><br/>The character development, story lines, crazy moments and soundtrack is masterful. As time goes on you grow with these characters. Don Draper on the outside is the perfect man but is easily the most flawed and complicated character. The Ad Men in this show present or aim to show themselves in a certain way which makes them great and selling commercials or feelings for clients. Pete Campbell is a fascinating character who is easy to loathe from the beginning but more relatable towards the end. One roots for him and understands him better. Whereas Roger Sterling starts at the top but evolves into a more archaic and somewhat pitiful character.<br/><br/>The depth in the writing and story is top notch. There is so much read into and observe. I will wait a little while before rewatching this show again and likely pick up and observe things I notice before. Mad Men is more than a show, it's an experience that made you feel something.
9/10 The first episode of Mad Men honestly represents the drinking, smoking, sexist fifties, a time when Madison Avenue's attitude and control permeated our entire culture, including one international political blunder after another, a time before anyone ever heard of political correctness. Gays were still in the closet, women slept their way to wherever they wanted to go, and advertising executives ruled the world. Everyone smoked because we all just looked so damn good doing it.<br/><br/>Mad Men captures not only the look of the fifties, it grabs all the details along with it. Here's a show for Aaron Sorkin fans, a show that treats the audience as adults, smartly written, yet a show that avoids pandering. At first, characters appear one dimensional but there's a hint of turmoil below the surface, a promise of things to come in future episodes. This, my friend, is an expose.'<br/><br/>I suspect Mad Men will be a small audience success story. It's a quality show, for grown ups, and the fact that it's on AMC will mean it can live a full life with less than network audience numbers.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the first episode and look forward to the next. Good job! The characters go around completely oblivious to how pointless their lives are. They think they have perfect marriages-- they don't. Perfect jobs-- nope. Perfect health even though they constantly smoke and drink-- nope. We can look back and see how phony it all was-- the advertising, the plastic homes and lives, and the social niceties and expectations. And here's the punchline-- it's US! TODAY! And that's the brilliance of the show. Today we are the same with different clothes and cars. We are jaded, full of irony and smarm, and believe we are self-aware. Imagine how a TV show (hologram show?) will look back at the sad folks of 2007 45 years from now. We tune out, blame others, scan the internet for porn, buy $5 coffee, and still can't fix the health care system. Apart from the amusement of looking into a 47 year-old mirror, the show gives us tremendous writing, acting, set decoration and drama. Let me re-emphasize my favorite part of the show-- set decoration. Kudos all around at the insistence of having the look of every scene strike me as true and accurate to the nth degree. I have watched each of the first episodes three times each. I love it!<br/><br/>(PS to those idiots chatting endlessly about electric typewriters and such: That's the smarminess I'm talking about. What would you rather watch? 'Flavor of Love'? 'The Steve Harvey Show'? 'According to Jim'? Gimme a break! Just enjoy a quality show while you can!!!) Women were objects, the steno pool was a sexist source of jokes, and the ad men were (they thought) at the top of their game. They had the world on a string and all was well in America. Eisenhower was brilliant, Communism was evil, Tobacco was good, and drinking in the office was just creative brainstorming.<br/><br/>Performance by Jon Hamm, as Don Draper deserves mention. I had not seen him in prior performances. He fits the narcissistic role of a creative director in advertising very well. A conflicted character, attempting to help his child-like wife make sense of her pointless life in the suburbs. (One may also read Sylvia Plath's "The Bell Jar" to get the actual effect of the time period on women. Also the film, "The Man in the Grey Flannel Suit", with Gregory Peck and Jennifer Jones, addressed the futility and role-playing of that era, particularly for women.) Vincent Kartheiser as an irritating newbie junior ad executive. John Slattery is amusing as Roger Sterling, the agency President and Sr. partner, his ego and libido running rampant. He has some amusing lines and despite being sleazy, is also a rather sympathetic character.<br/><br/>Overall well-written, the genre has been filmed before but certainly for a television series on AMC, this is daringly creative. It is the first non-dated, non-western I have seen on AMC in a decade. Well worth watching. 8/10. I don't think I have ever given any movie or show a 10, but this one deserves it. Everything about it is top notch. It's fiercely intelligent but not in a smug, obvious way. It's loaded with nuance, subtext, and meaning, but it's also entertaining on a purely superficial plot level. Its sense of irony is matched only by its verisimilitude. The writing and direction are superb. It is pretty near flawless<br/><br/>It can be hilarious, tragic, and everything in between. The characters and their development are stellar and addictively watchable. The casting and actors are perfect. Even January Jones and her woodenness work here. The only flaw I can think of is the abandonment of a closeted gay character--he just disappears with no explanation, and it's too bad. They were handling it very well, and the actor was wonderful.<br/><br/>Much has been said about the wardrobe and sets, and for good reason. They are perfect. They do not scream, hey, look at me. They are as authentic as it is possible to be. They are not self-conscious, just completely believable. The temptation to indulge in kitsch for its own sake is scrupulously avoided, and this was an era of supreme kitsch.<br/><br/>Much has also been said about the casual racism and sexism typical of the time. This is not a protest show. It is not here to "teach" us anything. The show is rooted in ruthless verisimilitude, and nothing is allowed to get in the way of that. Some people took this as permission to "celebrate" sexism--the short-lived TV show PanAm, about stewardesses in this same time period, was a clear example of missing the point of Mad Men. PanAm thought, cool, now we can do a sexy show about stewardesses before all this feminism nonsense sucked all the fun out of sexism. What they failed to see was the difference between exploitation and reality. Mad Men neither celebrates nor overtly condemns sexism and racism, but it does not flinch from showing its realities.<br/><br/>I really cannot overstate how good this show is. See it. I don't watch TV drama usually, with rare exceptions: The Sopranos (especially the early seasons) and Entourage, if that counts. Mad Men is one of the most original, refreshingly dark and complex shows I've ever seen on TV. Despite its potential for soap opera story lines, it consistently transcends expectations and explores fascinating characters and a radically changing social environment in a beautifully shot, artfully designed and, above all, excellently acted manner. After watching virtually no TV recently (less than three hours per week), my wife and I have been hooked all week, catching up on every episode - although we have yet to see the first, which a technical glitch in our On Demand service is holding tantalizingly out of reach. I loved Todd Haynes' Far From Heaven, and this is like a generously extended - and in some respects even more fascinating - adjunct to that. Madison Avenue is the perfect prism through which to view the early 1960s, and Mad Men, with its post-noir, Nixon/JFK/beatnik/martini melange, is a hugely enjoyable, finely measured cocktail that leaves just the right taste in the mouth. Ten Stars.<br/><br/>When this show first aired I couldn't watch it. I'm 68 years old. I know. I was there. EVERYBODY was a liar and a cheat. The smoking, the drinking, the hypocrisy and the infidelities. An entire mindset created to consume. An entire mindset created to re-enforce the social structures that kept women stoned on Valium, barefoot/pregnant and in nighties. For me, when it aired, it was too true to life. I didn't want to be reminded . . .<br/><br/>Now, 6 years later, I'm writing my autobiography and revisiting those times. Started watching Mad Men from S1-E1. This show is EXACTLY what it was like back then. EXACTLY. Young people: Students of history, contemporary anthropology, those of you in Theater/Acting Schools; watch this show. Take note.<br/><br/>The acting is superb, the art direction is exemplary and the production is flawless.<br/><br/>This show describes the very reason we took to the streets back in the 60's. This show points directly at the issue of "the more things change, the more they stay the same". This show clearly describes why the current generation may have to take to the streets again. I'm in love with this new show. As noted in previous comments (correcting other comments), this show takes place in 1960, and not the 50s. I find the criticism of this show funny--it's a television show, folks. I don't think it's meant to be 100% accurate. If it were, it would be pretty humdrum, imo.<br/><br/>A poster said he/she thought all the smoking and drinking was a bit much and contrived. However, I think it's fairly accurate. I'm in advertising NOW, and we always have vodka in the freezer...a couple of the men in the office open a bottle of scotch in the afternoons. Although the drinking on the clock isn't AS pronounced today as it was in 1960, I do believe Mad Men accurately depicts agency behavior during that time. My art director mentioned to me that the 70s in advertising were very similar; smoking and drinking in the office, on the clock.<br/><br/>I think Mad Men is genius. First of all, it's sexy; the colors, the lighting, the costumes, the dialogue...it's hot, hot, hot! It is also inspiring! The first episode's "It's Toasted" epiphany gave me goosebumps; ad dorks like me all know that "ah ha!" moment...we strive for it. We live for it.<br/><br/>So regardless of whether or not the typewriters are period or how despicable the women on the show are treated by the men (btw, there is still a lot of that going on in the work place, and for some reason, I think advertising alums are prone to it--I've encountered a couple creative and client meetings in which I was ashamed of the words coming out of the male mouths), this show is a good one that I plan to continue watching. I'm thrilled to find a show that, although it's not an accurate depiction of real "Mad" men and women, shows how inspiring good BIG ideas can be and that (as noted in another comment) good advertising is still created the old fashioned way...with creative and rational thinking and not computers. I'm 66, and have been watching movies and TV shows for more than 60 years. I grew up watching films when the audience didn't need a car chase or a gun fight every five minutes to keep its weak minds occupied.<br/><br/>When the MPAA rating system was introduced, producers and directors could finally make the movies they wanted, without interference (other than receiving a rating they didn't like). Though one can think of films that were (perhaps) gratuitously violent or sexual, * that freedom was not generally abused.<br/><br/>This age of mature film making lasted barely a decade. Its decline began with "Star Wars", as studios realized there was a huge youth market devoid of adult taste. This is why Hollywood currently turns out few "serious" pictures. ** When I read reviews of "Mad Men" and similar adult dramas (TV or otherwise), I'm surprised at the high percentage of reviewers who find them dull, badly written, and poorly acted. I can only imagine that most of them are under 30, and have never seen "good" motion pictures or TV shows.<br/><br/>I understand someone objecting to "Mad Men", "The Sopranos", "Deadwood", "Oz", "Justified", "Breaking Bad", etc, etc, //simply because they're entertainment// -- and one might spend one's spare time at more-productive and edifying pursuits. Looked at //objectively//, they are, indeed, time wasters.<br/><br/>But human beings like to hear (or see) stories, and that isn't about to change. I've seen all the series I listed, and all are excellent examples of good storytelling. If you find "Mad Men" dull or boring, it's because you have no interest in stories about human relationships.<br/><br/>Ditto for bad writing and bad acting. I wish I could write as well as David Chase or Robert Weiner. Only "Breaking Bad" has out-and-out bad acting (Anna Gunn, Dean Norris, Christopher Cousins). (Their acting might look bad because of how their parts are written -- but I don't think so. Oddly, in season 5, Gunn and Norris get noticeably better.)<br/><br/>A common complaint from the ignorant is that "these people aren't nice" or "they do bad things" (etc). Well, that's the point -- they're not supposed to be perfect -- just interesting. You wouldn't have much of a story otherwise. And -- let's be honest -- if the shows I've listed encourage decent, moral behavior in the viewers, it is only by negative example. ("Breaking Bad", in particular, shows how an otherwise "good" person can be seduced into horrifyingly immoral behavior. If you have teenage children, they really should watch this show and discuss it with you.)<br/><br/>People who find "Mad Men" (and similar shows) artistically worthless just don't know what they're talking about.<br/><br/>* "The Wild Bunch" comes to mind. Sam Peckinpah wanted people to be repulsed by violence, yet he's still thought of as a purveyor of "violence porn". Though violent, "Bonnie and Clyde" is a well-written/acted/directed film, in which the violence is not the focus.<br/><br/>** There seems to be revived interest in good films, possibly because the Academy again allows 10 nominations for Best Picture. Mad men is one of those very rare TV shows that take your breath away. Intensely clever, captivating, beautiful, every single word, every detail is just right. The episodes are real works of art, all of them. Once you get to peak into the lives of Don, Joan, Peggy, Roger and all of the incredibly rich characters you can never get enough. The scenes are so perfect I often pause to look at the details and get blown away by so much attention to every aspect - the gestures, the expressions, the makeup, the hairdos, the clothes, the colors, the furniture...- every scene is composed like a painting. What the team behind this show is doing is creating TV history. I used to think that after the Sopranos I would find everything else mediocre. And then I watched Mad Men. Matthew Weiner is a genius and being part of the two best shows in TV history is no accident. Watch it. TV will never be the same. I bought the DVD of Season One based on sheer buzz from friends.<br/><br/>It didn't knock my socks off at first --- it's not a show that's so out-of-the-box that it screams to be noticed --- but gradually the characters and scenarios grew on me. The writing was above average and even though the story lines seemed a bit thin from time to time, the acting was so good, the set design was so spot on, it got me hooked. And it did pick up momentum as the season sped toward it's conclusion.<br/><br/>Season Two's premiere episode left me dry. Even looking back, it's a strange one. The dialog is stilted, much of what comes out of the character's mouths doesn't seem to fit and --- ABSOLUTELY...NOTHING...HAPPENS. I kept reading people raving about Season Two, but couldn't quite see what they were enamored of. But Season Two got better...way better....the increase in the tension was elegant, effective. Good plots twists, nice character refinements.<br/><br/>Now Season Three.... As of this writing, we are now a third of the way into this year's installment and still not much has happened. Worse, virtually all of the story lines this year seem as banal and self-indulgent as that on the average soap. <br/><br/>We are just now getting into more Draper back story --- the only thing I could find interesting in FOUR HOURS of footage. Instead we have: -The Sal-in-the-closet plot. Boring...and done to death elsewhere. Perhaps if we were to explore '60s style repercussions or the threat within them that Sal is/might be up against, it might be interesting. So far, that hasn't happened. Nothing has. And the opener with the bellboy? Right, that was believable. Try Red Show Diaries, Matt. It was about that plausible. -The John McCain and Cindy Brady Show --- This grandfather/granddaughter sub-plot is taking up far too much time...it's literally a quarter of every episode and it belongs on Lifetime! The fact that the actors are grating and the characters weak and annoying don't help. I really hope there is a point to including this drivel later on. It's really hard to sit through. Thee you on the thee-thaw Cindy...like never! - Joan's Marriage - This is moving abysmally slow. Christina Hendricks is a great actress. She needs more to do. - Roger's Marriage - Again, standard soap opera fluff. OK, maybe that's too harsh...Doug Sirk standard fluff. That's better.<br/><br/>The exception here are Peggy and Pete. Despite the fact that the baby subplot seems to come and go in the show's writer's minds, almost at whim, Elisabeth Moss has ensured we still care about this character and her travails. Same with Vince Kartheiser's flawed and funny Pete.<br/><br/>All of this is not bad for passing-time-TV. It's the standard we've come to expect from networks that cow-tow to limited attention spans and low intelligence. But that's not why I started watching Mad Men....it's now become like EVERY OTHER SHOW.<br/><br/>To listen to Matthew Weiner's excessive self-accolades within his excessive commentaries you would think he'd created a Great Work of Deconstructionalist Art. I just think he was a writer who had a great idea at one time, but now hasn't any idea how to make that idea compelling any longer and has now fallen back on tried and true clichés. This series is absolute genius. Many people on here say they found it boring, which makes me wonder. Who can find this series boring?<br/><br/>From the first episode of season one, this series is absorbing. You begin to understand each character, except Don Draper, who is always a mystery.<br/><br/>This series is not for people who enjoy mainstream series with a pattern, such as House, The Closer, Grey's Anatomy etc. etc. Each episode is unique.<br/><br/>I'd like to refer to user rangeriderrango from Canada. He says "The men wear suits that the nerdiest of nerds wouldn't be caught dead in." Huh? Every suits fits them perfectly. This series is really strong in design and costumes.<br/><br/>A series that is so well made and yet intelligent and makes you think is rare. I highly recommend everyone to watch it. Three episodes was enough. I got it: the 60s were racist, sexist, unhealthy, and unsafe. (Also, very stylish.) And aren't we viewers today so smart for knowing better? <br/><br/>Must every character be such a louse? So tiresome. Not that they need be likable; The Sopranos was riveting, yet almost entirely devoid of anybody I'd ever want to be actual friends with. The difference, in the 3 episodes of this I saw, is that where The Sopranos insisted that the viewer be held responsible, Mad Men seems content to be superior. It wants to both revel in the tawdry details and be righteously outraged at the outdated mores it puts on display. I don't much care for either, and a television show that asks me to do both pushes the limits of my credulity. I could feel my strings being pulled.<br/><br/>No, Don's 'big secret' wasn't enough for me to keep watching- and when I was told what it is, I wasn't sorry in the least. Snoresville.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly there are many, many shows on television that are much, much worse. I don't watch them, either. Series 1, 2, and 3 constitute 39 episodes, hence this review cannot be comprehensive because there is far too much to say. This series is like a miracle, and may be the best American television drama series ever made. It is so rich in texture, so subtly profound in its extended character studies that the series as a whole is a joint work of art, and the contributions of many different directors (including Matthew Weiner, the creator, who directed the last episode of Series 3 himself) all seamlessly come together as a unity. It is a massively successful job of production and coordination, and Weiner as producer has kept the project on track like a general commanding an army on a highly extended battlefield. Now, let us not assume that this is necessarily a cheerful series. Every character in the series is unhappy, so that in itself is a bit of a downer. But we become so absorbed in the minutiae of the lives of them all that we actually care about what they are thinking and feeling. The series is 'made' by its chief actor, Jon Hamm, who is a miracle discovery of casting. He is such a natural leading man! He has the indefinable quality of compulsive watchability. We hang on his every word. His character speaks tersely, and we always wait for him to say a bit more, but he never does. He is the only character in the series with a 'back story', which is often dramatized in flashbacks, which despite the danger which such eruptions into the thread of the main storyline pose to the Aristotelian unities, all work successfully. The subtlest of all the performances is probably that given by the amazing January Jones, that Grace Kelly lookalike who has caused so many male hearts to throb uncontrollably that she is a greater threat to the health of men than cholesterol. She has managed a continuous, slow gradation over the course of three series from the status of 'Miss Perfect' via a steady character disintegration to achieve instead the status of 'Miss Odious'. Her character has a degree from Bryn Mawr, speaks fluent Italian, and has a brain which nobody ever sees because it is concealed by her perfect beauty. As I pointed out in my review of BLONDIE (1938), Miss Jones appears to have based her initial character persona on Penny Singleton. My personal favourite character in this series is Peggy Olson. I could simply sit and watch Elizabeth Moss, who plays her, for hundreds of hours, she is so fascinating. Everyone is compulsively mesmerised by Christina Hendricks, who plays Joan. I don't think any of us can believe that such a remarkable creature could exist. Vincent Kartheiser, who plays Pete Campbell, is equally mesmerising. He judges every scene and every facial twitch to perfection and is a great artist of his craft. Apparently, the reason why he portrays hatred so convincingly is that he really believes in it. It is impossible to praise the savage intensity of Kartheiser's performance highly enough. John Slattery, who plays Roger Sterling, is horribly endearing; he is such a male chauvinist pig and Epicurean, we hate him, but we always want him around because is simply irreplaceably amusing. Robert Morse is just perfect as Cooper, and he is such a pro. It is a pity that we have lost the character Salvatore, whose fate was so sad, and who was played so well by Bryan Batt, with such brave pathos. Perhaps the greatest surprise of the third series was the brilliant performance of the child actress Kiernan Shipka (born 1999) as Sally Draper. It was a stroke of genius to bring her in as a major character in the series, a task which she handles with the aplomb of a true professional. Tremendous backup in supporting roles is provided by such talented players as Maggie Siff, Embeth Davidtz, and Joseph Culp. One could go on and on, as the casting is so perfect. The period design, costumes, and atmosphere are also perfect. We are accurately shown the excessive and compulsive smoking and drinking of the era, which may it be a lesson to us all. As for the treatment of women and minorities, to see it all so brazenly and accurately portrayed before our eyes can only make us all wince painfully and ask ourselves: 'Was it really like that?' The answer is yes. This series is a unique social history lesson to younger people. Major events like the Kennedy assassination are woven seamlessly into the story, convincingly and authentically, using genuine footage. The series begins in 1959 and so far has reached 1964. My God! It all comes back!! It is deja-vu for those of us who were there, shockeroo time for those who weren't. Why send teenagers to school? Sit them down in front of this for 39 hours and they will learn much more about life. Never have we seen such depth of portrayal of characters' lives over a period of years in a TV series, or been so deeply stirred by the sad meaning of it all. The multiple saga of this series is so compulsive that it is responsible for an international epidemic of 'Mad Men addiction', an incurable condition which has defied all medical analysis, and the only treatment for which is to go on watching. Series 4 is eagerly awaited by millions of people currently in a trembling state of angst-ridden cold turkey. The true heroine of this series is the character Peggy Olson, who personifies the main theme of the series, which is the oppressed state of women at the time and their terrible and pathetic struggles to emerge from it, to achieve some dignity and recognition in a world of men which is so fantastically male-chauvinist that today we can barely conceive that things were ever like that, though alas they really were. 'Mad Men' entertaining smugfest. Filmmakers convinced of their intrinsic moral superiority to people in the sixties. Viewers too, presumably. Slickly done eg derided single-mum is superwoman - even discovered exercise before it became fashionable. It'll be a retro cult comedy in 2040.<br/><br/>This is more a reflection of the first decade of the 21st Century than the Sixties. Yes, much of it is accurate, but the joke is the emphasis on what the filmmakers believe the poor people in he sixties didn't know they had got wrong.<br/><br/>It's funny to see how the stereotypes are so fixed in the filmmakers - and they think that they are pointing out sixties stereotypes.<br/><br/>There are none so blind as those that will not see, particularly if they are smug and self- righteous. I caught the tail end of this era when I started work in advertising in a backwater town in 1970. I can say that this series captures the flavor with surprising accuracy. I was there; I know.<br/><br/>Advertising was -- at the time -- an industry that took itself far too seriously --possibly because it was the destination of second rate managers (albeit first rate creative people). From a manager's perspective, advertising could never lead to the presidency of a "real" company. And advertising was a parasitic enterprise requiring a lot of what we used to call "schmoozing." As nobody knew what would eventually work with the public, we had to play golf with the clients, drink and dine with them, and in some cases, facilitate a little bit of sin. <br/><br/>Sexism was woven into everyday's activities. The partners had the window offices and were often 'creating' for hours behind closed doors. One of our partners worked until about 10 every night to avoid dealing with his family. Another had a 'special relationship' with his secretary (who looked a lot like Christina Hendricks) unbeknownst to his wife. One partner was weak and incompetent, but was carried because he was a co-founder.<br/><br/>In other words, this series is very much like revisiting my first ad agency job. I find the anachronisms (like the term 'play date' in the first episode) to be quite tolerable in the context of a big picture look at the 60s ad world. <br/><br/>There was a saying at the time: run it up the flagpole and see if anybody salutes. As one who was there, I salute Mad Men. Mad Men is a masterful period drama which explores the world of advertising in New York City in the 1960s. Over seven seasons, it is a slow-moving yet effective character study lovingly recreates a decade of intense social change and, thorough its nuanced characters, reflects the true nature of the human condition. Deeply psychological, madly funny, strongly emotional and compulsively entertaining all at the same time, Mad Men is both an artfully crafted series and an emotional examination into the insecurities that bind us all together. ... because producers seem to think that just because they portray this stylish era, they can be sloppy about the plot. One of the most frustrating things I found is that many interesting plot threads are started and are never followed up upon later (or just not enough). A lot of scenes could be just easily left out since they don't contribute to the understanding of the characters or the plot (seriously, do we really need to see Don taking a long walk across the office or smoking leisurely at a restaurant with nothing else going on?). Instead, producers could spend more time on good dialogs, because the dialogs in this show are trite for the most part.<br/><br/>In my opinion, most people give it good ratings because either they like the era, or because it got so much attention from the media. Or they suspect that there's more to this show than they see, and maybe they just "don't get it". I only watched it because I heard about it on NPR. I watched the whole first season and two episodes from the second season. Each episode left me with a hollow feeling: "And this is it?" I'm not going to waste any more of my time on this over-hyped show. Let me make one thing perfectly clear--Mad Men is not The Sopranos. Now, with that out of the way, I think I can give an honest opinion about this overrated show. Yes, it's overrated, and it's overly hyped as well.<br/><br/>When Mad Men first came out, I read the reviews that stated the show was the next best thing to The Sopranos. After watching Season 1 and half of Season 2, I think not. Don't get me wrong, I'll give proper credit to where credit is due. Mad Men is an extremely colorful take of the Camelot years of the sixties, when the Kennedys were in power and The Rat Pack was conquering Las Vegas. The show is colorful, full of wonderful women to look at, gorgeous fashion styles, glossy cars, and lots of booze and smoking. Oh, and there are lots of affairs amongst the many beautiful characters.<br/><br/>But, that's not what the bother is.<br/><br/>Mad Men suffers from a lack of story, loss of basic thematic elements and mediocre plotting beats. In a word: dull. Some may argue that what is perceived as dull may just be the result of the senses' overexposure to romantic comedies and action flicks. This is not true. One can sit through The Sopranos, yet still feel the plot going forward.<br/><br/>This brings me to Mad Men's comparison to The Sopranos. The key protagonist to Mad Men, Don Draper, has a secret, is torn inside and is trying his best to keep the awkward dealings in his life together. Unfortunately, not only is the character fairly drab, but also the actor lacks the capability to express any type of emotion beyond a sneer or constipated grimace. His face can't seem to shape to articulate sadness, despair, anger or fury. His actions are even worse. It doesn't matter if the scene involves drama, romance or comedy, he just acts the same way in every scene without deviation.<br/><br/>James Gandolfini, who played Tony Soprano, however, has a vast range of twitches in his repertoire that he can express cruelty and love all with one glance. He can be subtle or in-your-face just by the way he squints his eyes.<br/><br/>By the same token, The Sopranos had a complex set of characters with their own quirks and their own historical story lines. It's only after vigilant research do we discover the intricate relationships between them all and their effect on subplots carefully added seasons prior by the writers. Also, The Sopranos had varying degrees of atmospheres, moods and weather patterns. Mad Men seems to miss out on all this.<br/><br/>Mad Men also lacks basic storytelling techniques. Regardless of all the rave reviews and awards being piled on this show, which is probably because of all the SPP (Strategic Product Placements), the show goes nowhere. Subplots begin, but never really resolve to much of anything. I think the advertisers love Mad Men because of all the notable mentions they receive throughout the show. Guess who pays for the awards shows? You got it, advertisers.<br/><br/>And finally, there is one more thing that needs to be said. Not to give away any storyline, but, when a parent dies, the reaction of an offspring character should be what they're feeling. It's not a monologue, discussing what they should be feeling. Even if the parent is unloved, the child should at least, for the sake of those observing their actions, show some sort of emotion of some kind—even an acknowledgment would suffice. It is not walking into the boss's office telling, and him that he didn't know how he should feel. I get better satisfaction watching Bugs Bunny cartoons than watching elementary school actors deliver empty lines from undeveloped scripts. I really wanted to like "Mad Men", but you shouldn't have to force yourself to enjoy something. The set designs and costumes are great, and they really seem to capture the era they represent very well, but the acting and story lines leave much to be desired. Much of the acting is done in a style in which the actors don't seem to allow themselves to actually take on the persona of their character, which results in a very wooden performance. The storyline moves very slowly and ironically advertises the business of advertising as a very boring and simple career which anyone could succeed at, which I hope for the sake of advertisers is not true. This show has received rave reviews from many publications, but that may just be a response to the lack of good dramatic television and the fear of a reality television takeover. While I do think that "Mad Men" is a step in the right direction in terms of 'New American Television', I don't think it's as magnificent as it's been touted to be by other critics, but let's not throw out the baby with the bathwater, unless of course a better baby is on the way... Amazing the types of shows Hollywood will spend its money hyping...<br/><br/>Mad Men is pretty much the exact opposite of what you'd expect reading the hype.<br/><br/>It's dull, boring, uninspiring and features really, really dull and wooden performances, especially by the lead who is as expressive as a piece of carved wood.<br/><br/>If you need a show to watch to put you to sleep, Mad Men is your show.<br/><br/>If you want quality, you'll learn to avoid shows that get "emmy recognition" for what they are: hyped-up snoozefests.<br/><br/>Just another bad show. I agree that the series lacks depth. I, myself being in advertising and working on Tobacco products, can easily mesh with the Characters: i.e. client-creative-client service relationships. My favorite scene though was from first season, Let me just say "Carousel" If every show was as good as that presentation- I wouldn't feel like I was wasting my life away... BTW why does Betty always talk so slow, it seems like she is on something.<br/><br/>What needs to happen is either focus more on the advertising or more on the 60's, or strengthen both aspects to form a solid story to keep the viewer interested. 3 stars for great production and period feel. The first show I've ever been tempted to keep watching with the volume off as opposed to not watching it at all.<br/><br/>As usual, the white American businessman is a swinish lout, mired in misogyny, antisemitism, racism, unfaithfulness and ensconced in a dull meandering mess masquerading as a plot.<br/><br/>So this show is politically incorrect? This show is the most politically correct I've ever seen bar none. The political agenda of the writers pounds through in almost every scene, a dull, throbbing hammer banging the "truth" into our addled heads. It's as if advertising is the avocation of characters whose real vocation is actually "keeping the Jews down." <br/><br/>Those looking for an intelligent treatment of the golden era of advertising as I was, please continue your search. This ain't it. The advertising agency here is only a backdrop for a yawn of a soap opera rife with dopey, clichéd leftist subtext. Avoid, just as I will be avoiding the Golden Globes, other award shows, and any other Hollywood treatments of big business going forward. To read the hype on Mad Men, you'd think this show would be some sort of compelling television.<br/><br/>Alas, like many over-hyped shows before it, Mad Men is nothing special. It is slow, ponderous, and generally poorly acted.<br/><br/>In particular, one has to wonder as to why anyone would pick Jon Hamm as a good actor. The man is as frozen as a snowman and expresses himself through a series of hilariously cheesy grimaces.<br/><br/>Mad Men fails to give to the audience what its ads promise, which is a really bad idea. The only thing that lives up to the hype is the pretty cool title sequence.<br/><br/>One wishes the product had been as good as the advertising. I must say that it really doesn't surprise me that so many people dislike this show. While I disagree with their sentiment, it is understandable.<br/><br/>Unlike many other current shows, such as Glee or Raising Hope and the like, this show demands the viewer's time and full attention. The airwaves are constantly bombarded with sitcoms, the likes of which hardly take any commitment whatsoever on the audience's part. In our busy lives, it's far easier to watch something that doesn't command your full attention so that, if needed, you can leave the screen for a few minutes and come back without really missing anything at all. The laugh tracks, along with the actors' goofy faces tell us when to laugh and, most likely, whatever tidbit we've missed is part of the episode's linear plot and will be revisited.<br/><br/>Of course, there's nothing wrong with such streamlined shows. Lord knows I've enjoyed many of them.<br/><br/>However, Mad Men is entirely different. If you want to start watching and you are aware that you are always on call at the office, make sure that Netflix or Hulu is at your disposal. Mad Men is full of minute, yet sophisticated details that are subtle but, crucial. This show is the creation of a classy set of writers, directors, and cinematographers that seemingly have faith in the integrity of their audience. They expect you to catch the characters' sly remarks, one-liners, and overall disposition, without compromising the overall plot line.<br/><br/>For example, if you're used to having characters blatantly spell out their emotions for the viewer to understand, you won't find that here. The characters within the show speak through their actions, much as we do but, just as our's are, their actions are subtle and if you doze off, you may miss something crucial.<br/><br/>Honestly, as a high school student, I can't think of a single person my age that has watched and enjoyed Mad Men. I can also count on one hand the amount of kids my age that like Inception. They were mostly confused and repelled by it. Some even fell asleep. I hypothesize that they would have the same reaction to this although, it's less mind boggling, in my opinion. I like being challenged to understand and keep up by my entertainment endeavors, i.e books, films, television, etc. Many others don't, which is fine. If you don't, this probably isn't your show.<br/><br/>I urge everyone to give this show a chance because, in my opinion, it is brilliant. At first glance, yes it is about an ad company. But, you'll quickly realize that it's truly about America. This show is a depiction of our growth and an excellent glimpse into our history, which isn't to say that it's always correct. I'm sure that there are plenty of anachronisms and other little mistakes but, I haven't taken notice of any.<br/><br/>Mad Men is also a character study of Don Draper and Peggy Olson. I can't claim to have felt anything other than tolerable disdain for Draper in the first few episodes for various reasons. However, what I realized is that he truly is an accurate depiction of person. We all have flaws, some not as bad as his, some far worse. He isn't perfect and, really, we should probably stop making our television characters out to be perfect because perfections simply doesn't exist. He is charismatic and charming and can be both a wonderful and horrid man in the course of a single day (within the show). I enjoy Peggy's character because she symbolizes the growth of freedom for women in the '60s as she moves up the corporate ladder from being Don's secretary to being a copy writer.<br/><br/>My only warning when watching this show is this: realize that it's going to take an entire season for you to really know whether you like this show or not. You won't know by the end of the first, or even the fifth episode. If you have an interest in our history as a society or just a general interest in the 1960's, give this one a spin. The wardrobe is spectacular and the language is dead on. If this is the Best TV can offer, then maybe it's time to trade in your TV for something more productive.<br/><br/>In truth, Mad Men is very, very, very far away from the best TV can offer.<br/><br/>Mad Men is boring, trite and poorly acted. That its channel has decided to hype it to high heaven and went so far as to mount massive PR campaigns to get it awards it doesn't deserve only shows that bad taste and lack of respect for the audience reign in parts of Hollywood.<br/><br/>Speaking of bad quality, Jon Hamm has to be one of the worst actors in his generation. He is as emotive as a piece of cardboard (or perhaps wood) and deadpans most of his scenes in a fashion that kills what little excitement there may have been.<br/><br/>Overall, this is yet another example of Hollywood hyping a bad product and they really need to learn that quality will prevail in the end, not hype. I stuck it out with "Mad Men" for a few weeks. I was trying to see the fantastic new show everybody kept talking about. Sadly, it wasn't there. I think people like it because it's the first scripted AMC series since "Hu$tle," because of the colors, and because it comes from Matthew Weiner of "The Sopranos." The few things I like about it are mostly style and atmosphere, not story or performance quality. In fact, the stories are very similar-- it's kind of like a miniseries that is now running indefinitely-- and the performances are actually very bad, except from Jon Hamm and Elisabeth Moss-- and the lines they deliver are still not that impressive. The attitude of "Go ahead and do this stuff-- it's not gonna kill you" would have been interesting back when we first found out that the products these people sold actually killed us. However, the show now feels clunky and dated. Then, of course, there is the sex that happens in (at least what seems like) every episode. It's almost as if viewers would dry up and crumble if they watched a show where everybody kept their clothes on. All that aside, this isn't a bad show-- just an insipidly bland and indistinguishable one. AMC thinks it is very clever to hype this snoozefest and that it is "putting it on the map".<br/><br/>I'm not sure what map they're thinking of.<br/><br/>Maybe the map of boring television.<br/><br/>Mad Men is insufferably pretentious and yet poorly acted and oh so very, very boring.<br/><br/>John Hamm, who has also been over-hyped to degrees unimaginable only a few years ago is not a good actor. He sleeps through most of his scenes and seems to think that acting consists in making a series of grimaces. There is no life here.<br/><br/>There is no life in Mad Men (and incidentally, in case you hadn't noticed, ratings are so low you need a magnifying glass to see them at the bottom of the Nielsens).<br/><br/>AMC should get a clue and move on to something more promising. When this series first came out I watched it...at least the first four episodes. It looks good, the sets, the wardrobe, the actors general look. I grew up in that era and can remember what is was like. I lost interest when I came to the conclusion that the characters were all clichés, the dialogue consisted of actors making speeches to each other and the stories were boring.<br/><br/>I also had a problem with the amount of smoking and drinking that occurred. It soon became a distraction. Even if offices that allowed smoking and drinking, they would have never allowed as much as happens during Mad Men. <br/><br/>I would not recommended this series to anyone. It reminds me of a product I used to purchase, Fiddy-Faddle. The box was interesting, but what was inside was only popcorn. I am generally not a fan of series TV shows, since I don't have much time to devote to them. Still, having heard the hype surrounding "Mad Men," and seeing that the entire first season was being repeated on InDemand, I figured to make the time commitment.<br/><br/>The first few episodes were strong, well-written, and full of promises to come (or at least I thought). Every show of this type needs to establish its characters, relationships, and plot points. But with each successive episode, I began to get a vaguely unsettling sense that the show was actually going nowhere.<br/><br/>Soon, little things became bigger and bigger annoyances: I began to notice an almost fetishistic obsession with "things:" typewriters, fish sticks, bric-a-brac, as if the art director wasn't confident in his ability to establish a time period without beating us over the head with how "authentic" everything was (and it isn't, as I know this period well). Then, lead Jon Hamm plastered a single expression on his face and left it there, episode after episode, something between chronic constipation and wizened incredulity, and even the charms (there are many)of Christina Hendricks couldn't overcome my irritation.<br/><br/>So much could have gone right with this show, that to see how much has gone wrong is downright painful. If you're gonna write a show about reprehensible people (and nearly everyone in "Mad Men" is exactly that), then you either better have a kick-ass plot (think "The Sopranos") or give me a reason to care about what happens to the characters. Sadly, "Mad Men" fails on both points. It coulda been, but probably never will. Sorry but this is yet another case of the Hollywood promotional machine pushing on the public something that should have been taken back to the drawing board.<br/><br/>Far from living up to its hype, Mad Men is boring, predictable and unengaging.<br/><br/>A lot of the fault lies on John Hamm. It's hard to fathom how anyone could enjoy his performances which consist of him looking as frozen as an actor with stage fright with an occasional grimace added.<br/><br/>Overall, a huge miss that AMC would be well-served to cancel quickly if it doesn't want to join the fate of FX in hyping a consistently losing show like The Shield. Like many who wrote sharp critiques against Avatar the movie, I found much of the same parallels between love of a well art directed movie and a well art directed TV show.<br/><br/>There are reviewers here pointing out how Mad Men has been compared to Sopranos, and the acute viewer has pointed out how Tony Soprano is much more nuanced and complicated and more important, human, than Don Draper.<br/><br/>It's hard to believe fans of Men Men are getting behind a story of a man who is a complete coward and gets his jollies from bossing around only people with spines made of melted jelly.<br/><br/>Tony Soprano, in contrast, continues to fight himself, his wife and kids, his uncle, his domineering past, the ghost of his father, his passive aggressive sister, his nephew (who is in reality his cousin), his subordinates who would kill (literally) to have his job. <br/><br/>I think for anyone who has struggled to get anywhere in life, the stories in the Sopranos remind us that no-one is exempt from the struggle of humanity. Not even a high powered mob boss. <br/><br/>Through the struggle, we the audience are reminded of what it is to be human. We are challenged to understand ourselves through these very flawed but nuanced rich selfish yet warm yet thoughtful characters.<br/><br/>In contrast, Don Draper, an escapist unable to have a conversation about anything worth talking about. He avoids revealing anything of himself and when we finally discover some truth about him, it's supposed to play like some soul searching version of Lost. Instead of me feeling like I care about him, I just shake my head and wish he'd just get fired and divorced and living in a cardboard box somewhere. At least I'd be able to care about that guy, the once great Don Draper, than the smooth-shaven know it all who doesn't really have that much of an insight anyway.<br/><br/>And then there are the other characters that seem written out of movie/TV archetypes for beginners:<br/><br/>The nerdy girl finding her womanhood and inner strength. The rich kid who lives an empty unfulfilling life of entitlement. The lying S.O.B. love to hate him philandering boss with a secret heart of gold. The gay guy in denial. The slut with a heart of gold. The ingénue who married too young. The Hero who is a coward at heart<br/><br/>Of course I realize that clichés are clichés because they are so true. But when they are done in such obvious ways, I just couldn't believe in the characters.<br/><br/>Instead of flesh and blood, these characters feel like archetypes than people. It was as if the writer watched a film like Wizard of Oz and said, hey! I'll write the Lion as a creative director guy... yeah! Oh! Oh! Who'll play the Tin Man?!<br/><br/>Eventually this 'clever' conceit was spun into an allegory of modern times and advertising and we now have millions of fans who don't really have time to deconstruct the clichés. Instead viewers are lulled into thinking this is witty and charming and smart and amazing.<br/><br/>For the minority like myself, I found this show too well dressed and see it for what it is. It is exactly like its main character, shallow and hollow at its core. <br/><br/>And if this is true, what does this say about its audience? This is apparently becoming the norm in TV Executive circles: If your show doesn't appeal to the public, just hype it, hype it and hope the press doesn't notice.<br/><br/>What those tactics bring to the networks I really don't know. What I do know is that because of them, we are bombarded with shows that are really not that good and that are sold to us are being, somehow, great.<br/><br/>Case in point is Mad Men, a dread, colorless, poorly acted series. It's a show that just does not add up to much and definitely does not hold the attention, as exemplified by its ratings which were dismal.<br/><br/>But we are told that it's supposed to be great. Well, Emmy Academy, "supposed to" does not make it great, but it does make the Emmys into a joke.<br/><br/>And it leaves us stranded with yet another bad show that will not die. People kept telling me that they loved this show so I ended up getting the DVDs of the first season. I watched the entire series, hoping it would grow on me. I have to say though that I was bored at the beginning and I was bored at the end. <br/><br/>I kept hoping for it to get more interesting but really when you base a show on a bland character what do you expect? You get a bland show. The producers seemed unwilling to take the show anywhere daring, relying on the period far too heavily to hold interest and just staying stuck in first gear. It's not what I expected from the creator of The Sopranos. That show was certainly not afraid to go to new places, at least when it first started. Mad Men succeeds on so many levels for modern television fans yet fails on one very integral and basic level: Where is the brilliant advertising? The costumes, sets, interiors and exteriors are a feast for the eyes... the prop objects are nearly fetishistic in their detail (apart from some already well-noted anachronisms mentioned here.) While the accents and regionalisms are as weak as on most shows about the past, the content is pretty accurate of a society still preoccupied with its own sense of progress and invention. Even the soap-opera storytelling is done with flair and foreshadowing. What is NOT inventive is the lack of advertising principles, ideas, brainstorming, and even devil's advocacy so prevalent in Madison Avenue then as now. The print work is dire... text printed over model's faces, and everyone seems to love it. Sure we drink (and even smoke) even today in this business (moreso here in London or Europe), but I know for certain that we would not be in advertising long if we were unable to come up with plausible multi-national ideas and artwork in meetings. Drinks or not. The fanatic (note "fan" in fanatic), unthinking embrace by many viewers of this soap opera(Yes, it is a night time sudser in the same sink with All My Children) and its characters is only explicable in terms of a puerile taste for soft porn and titillation, caused, not by pretty females in the cast, but by all the booze consumed, the fags smoked and the obvious sensual bonanza for gays and hetero women when Don Draper takes off his hat. Very sexy, very virile--only one so tedious as Don could be known best for the way he takes off his hat.<br/><br/>Sorry, low-taste viewers, this show was barely worth one 13 episode series. It muddles along now in the glory of its "period" setting and ever-worsening plots and character shallowness. This paean to lives defined by cigs, adultery, hard-ass main character who manages to be attractive (think "hat" and the way he doffs it--also loving camera shots of the hat is a thrilling attempt to suggest self-pleasuring as an approved form of sexual behavior. I continue to watch so I can write negative things about each show for my wife's education--she loves the show,but she also is energized by Jersey Shore and Judge Judy.<br/><br/>True, the red head, full figured woman is a minor success, but all the rest of the show's mediocrity that oozes from this show drowns her performance and character. Finally, John Hamm can't act, which is good because he fits right in with the other characters who ham up their performances and achieve well...nothing. Funny show, well written and very clever. It certainly shows how things have changed since the 50's. I love the costuming, sets and scripting. It's reminiscent of "Far From Heaven" in they way it looks. While the script certainly is laden with sexist comments, it's important to remember the time line in which the story occurs. It's refreshing to see something other than the usual mundane lawyer/doctor/touchy-feely family shows that seem to permeate the airwaves now. I'm looking forward to seeing more of it. I hope it does not meet the same demise as such clever shows as "Huff" and "Dead Like Me". I like seeing something a bit more imaginative once in a while. After watching the first season I read a comment about how it is nothing, but down hill after that the first and hoped that it was not true. Unfortunately after watching the second season I realized how close this show was to being great and how they screwed it up, pretty badly.<br/><br/>First thing, the ending to the second season for me is pathetic I hate when a show ends a season just gearing up for the next one rather than ending with a bang and then rebuilding during the next season. This idea is not only possible, but in practice with some of the biggest shows around that just have superior story lines and can keep rebuilding every year.<br/><br/>Another part with it missed out is in the past of Don. I mean good God talk about a fascinating subplot. Unfortunately the writers decided to include next to nothing in both seasons about who this mystery character actually is.<br/><br/>Really the only reason that I find myself watching this show is because I am bored and it can keep me entertained enough. There are never those episodes where you simply cannot wait to watch the next one. If I am bored enough then I just decide to watch a couple episodes, but it really does not do much to keep me hooked.<br/><br/>All in all a great idea, with a mediocre show. Mad Men is poorly written, it spews continually lackluster dialogue, and it struggles with one boring plot line after another. The show boasts quite the cast, but this only underscores how poorly the writers have done in utilizing the talent at their disposal. When it first came out I was intrigued, and subsequently watched several episodes, but it didn't take long to come to the realization that there is simply no "there" there. Short of the somewhat unique premise of the series, there is absolutely nothing about this show that warrants the attention it is getting. Are people really so shallow that they fall for this sophomoric, gimmicky drivel? When I heard that it was actually winning awards I couldn't even believe by ears. Mad Men is every bit as trite and pathetic as our modern movies and music. Style over substance, nothing more. I found this series on Netflix. I was hooked from the first scene. The dialogue is so engaging and the drama keeps you wanting to see more. I am now on season 4 and I feel like I have a better understanding of the ad world and what they go through. I also see the beginning sequence of the images shattering coming to life and making sense. I love how you get to see issues from different characters, though the main focus is on Don Draper. This show demonstrates the attempts to separate the work life from the personal life and how sometimes the unity of both cannot be avoided. It also shows the difference between the work face that people put on versus the face that is seen when the work day is over. It also shows how good work relationships can make a world of a difference in someones life. If you enjoy watching characters being developed, enjoy becoming a part of the series as if your in the office looking on and you enjoy the truth of the imperfection of human beings, you'll enjoy this show. The strange part about Urban American life is that often people don't really know each other. They may think that since they see and interactive with others on a daily basis, they know those people. However, it is more frequent that they don't really know one other. Their true faces are hidden behind a fabricated veneer when they step into the elevator that goes up to the 13th floor of the high-rise office building in Lower Manhattan. Co-workers see each other on a day-to-day basis but may not know the person on the inside, let alone secrets from a darker past. And sometimes, even spouses may not know the whole story concerning to whom they are married. Simultaneously, the superficial veneer starts to wear, and hidden secrets come to light unexpectedly. A word or a phrase said out of context or out of character, or a misconstrued action might break down the veneer.<br/><br/>"Mad Men" chronicles the lives of such people who seem to be putting on an act for each other, their co-workers and loved ones, all the while keeping the Lucky Strike cigarette company well in the black. Ironically, the setting is an advertisement agency in downtown New York. "Mad Men" was the nickname for advertising men whose agencies were primarily habituated on Madison Avenue in the Big Apple. Advertising consists of presenting corporate facades with exaggerated themes and/or slogans with a particular "hook" to entice customers into buying goods and/or services. The "Mad Men" contrive many different approaches for many different clients: naming a particular kind of bank account for adult males as "The Executive", propagating that a steel company single-handedly built New York, or using sexual innuendos to attract smokers toward a particular cigarette brand. The clients and their need for better advertising ideas never end which keeps the advertising business thriving.<br/><br/>The stories center around a particular advertising agent, Donald "Don" Draper, often seen through the eyes of his new secretary Peggy who can't quite figure him out. Draper is a master of the advertising spin, able to leap into imaginative ad techniques with every bound. He wins awards for his ad copies and is an invaluable asset to the advertising firm. But Draper has many secrets. Despite having a beautiful wife and beautiful children, Draper engages in extra-marital liaisons. He is aloof with not only his co-workers but with his family, often seeming like a house guest when he with his family. We also learn that Donald Draper is an assumed name, and he has a long lost brother with whom he wants to cut all ties. In addition to his mistress and his wife, Draper often can't resist a sexual fling, a JKF-like sexual appetite that never lets up. <br/><br/>The other characters appear equally at odds with themselves and their situations. Jealousies run rampant through the organization. Pete Campbell, the youngest of the Mad Men, is relegated to making sure potential clients are made to feel at home, and good, by sometimes arranging for sexual encounters for older CEO's after hours. At one point, Campbell is reprimanded when he pleases a client with an original ad copy that saves an account, even though Campbell credits Draper with the idea. And in another episode, a fellow Mad Men sells a story to the New Yorker thereby sparking jealousy among the fellow ad men.<br/><br/>And behind the Mad Men are the women, often allowing their men to play these strange roles. Outwardly subservient, while simultaneously suspicious that things are not right, the wives find themselves caught up in a game they neither understand nor remember signing on to play. And the secretaries, who seem either naive or insightful, understand the exploits of their employers but are dedicated to maintaining the status quo to achieve favoritism. The wives are homemakers, caring for the children and the house, preparing wonderful dinners for the husbands in the evening. And when their mad men return home from work, they appear like strangers in their own households. The men engage more time either at work or extra-curricular activities than at home, their wife and children seeming more like casual acquaintances.<br/><br/>"Mad Men" is a breath of fresh air in the TV drama genre. In the past, shows of this nature have been either exaggerated in one direction or the other. Shows have often been either Dynasty/Dallas or Eight is Enough/Brady Bunch--either too dramatically overstated in regards to sex, money and power or overly sentimental in regards to family, friends, and commitment. "Mad Men" treads the blurry line, straddling between the two, exploring melodramatic material without lapsing into cliché or unbelievability. What keeps the writing fresh and alive seems to be the understanding of their characters. The Mad Men help companies advertise fabricated persona's for their clients. Why do they also enact the same false persona's for their co-workers and loved ones? Future episodes may reveal more about who they really are... Two of my favorite "Mid - Century Modern" movies set in a New York office are Billy Wilder's 1960 Oscar - winning _The Apartment_ and 1959's plush soap opera (and now gay camp fave) _The Best of Everything_ (derived from the pot - boiling Rona Jaffe novel of the same name; the blatant publicity tie - in between the book and the movie paved the way for the modern publishing "blockbuster" that found ultimate fruition in Jacqueline Susann's 1966 _Valley of the Dolls_)...<br/><br/>Sooooo, when I came across the set - in - 1960 _Mad Men_ I was pretty intrigued. Would they get it right? Would the characters seem shallow and soap opera - ish a la _The Best of Everything_ or would it be the deeper character study that was _The Apartment_? And very importantly, would there be a 1960 "feel" to the production, or would it just be a witless wallow in what some clueless young production team imagined 1960 to be?<br/><br/>Count me as a satisfied fan. The characters are complex, and so are their dilemmas. The juxtaposition between the complacent (but somewhat neurotic; after all, we were embroiled in a Cold War and Space Race; use of tranquilizers and psychoanalysis had reached a faddish level) optimism of the late Eisenhower - early New Frontier era and the mounting self - realizations and self - doubts of the characters and their places in the "American Dream" pecking order are intriguing. The shiny, artificial NEW! NEW! NEW! America as represented by Madison Avenue advertising would soon enough be set on it's head by _The Feminine Mystique_, the Surgeon General's report on smoking, civil rights strife, assassinations, the Berkeley Free Speech Movement, and Vietnam, gay rights...some of these looming concerns are addressed in the scripts. As depicted so well in one of the ad meetings, the age of the gaudy but useless tail fin was receding, and the practical "Think Small" Volkswagen and it's ilk would eventually set mighty and impregnable Detroit on a course from which it is STILL reeling... <br/><br/>I'll deduct one star for "continuity" (those 70's - 80's IBM Selectrics!), but the sexual harassment incidents are spot - on. So is the characters' CONSTANT smoking and drinking -- remember, alcohol fueled a LOT of the comedic office hi - jinks in the Doris Day - Rock Hudson hits _Pillow Talk_ and _Lover Come Back_, and also in the splendid earlier (1957) Madison Avenue spoof _Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?_ (starring Jayne Mansfield and Tony Randall). In the episodes so far office imbibing is on the distaff side of those frothy comedies, taking on the darker amber dipsomaniacal hues of _The Apartment_ and _The Days Of Wine And Roses_...<br/><br/>So I'm pretty pleased with this show, and especially so since it's done on an ADULT level...in it's plumbing of the characters' depths it's every bit as good as Todd Hayne's recent set - in - 1958 homage to Douglas Sirk, _Far From Heaven_. And if the ad agency were ONLY set in the Seagram Building I would even forgive those out - of - place Selectrics and merit it a smooth "10"... :-)<br/><br/>Addendum added on 8/23/07:<br/><br/>On tonight's episode ad exec Don Draper was shown on his bed reading _The Best of Everything_. His wife came in and started commenting on the movie, saying how awful Joan Crawford looked ("...however old she says she is now...her eyebrows looked like caterpillars pasted on...AND she was standing NEXT to Suzy Parker...!!!"). As a HUGE fan of _The Best of Everything_, Crawford, and Suzy Parker I'm adding that additional star to my rating - for this it IS a solid "10"...!!! I know that everybody has differing tastes but i am at a complete loss as to how anybody (let alone most people on IMDb) could actually like this show.<br/><br/>If you have not seen this programme then allow me to summarise it for you. (at least up to and including episode 9) In every episode you will see too much drinking, too much smoking and too many extra marital affairs. About 2% of every episode involves these 'mad men' having to advertise something and about 1% of each show has a tit bit of information in and around what was actually going on in 1960.<br/><br/>By the way are you aware that every married man in 1960 was having an affair and every single woman wanted to be in an affair? no neither was i...<br/><br/>Such poor writing in a show that had so much promise as was highlighted in the first episode. At first, this show intrigued me. It gave a glimpse into an era long gone. The set and acting were both superb.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the novelty soon wore off and I was left waiting for the plot and characters to grab me. Some shows take a few episodes to pull you in, which is fine, but there has to be a cutoff point where you decide the show just isn't for you or the show isn't good enough itself - I can't sit and watch 10-15 episodes just for something to happen. Halfway through season 1, I gave up on waiting for something to happen. I wasn't pulled into the mysterious Don Draper at all. Nothing interesting was happening and I found myself bored by the constant sexism, drinking, smoking, etc. I wanted to watch Mad Men as it was recommended in a lot of websites on articles along the lines of: "Shows you should binge watch" The IMDb rating of 8.7 proved to further bolster that point. <br/><br/>The problem with Mad Men is not necessarily the plot line is bad and the events that take place in the story are uncalled for and are characterised by bad writing -- it's because not a lot happens. And I really want to emphasise on that. Nothing happens. I found that watching it was just watching a cinematic recording of some guys in an advertising agency. It wasn't like a TV show where I was like, "Cool! That would be memorable if that happened in real life!" There was nothing exciting or anything that at least somewhat kept me on the edge of my seat whilst viewing it. After each episode, I felt no desire to watch the next one. It was just dull and mundane. <br/><br/>A positive for the show, I'd like to point out, is the atmosphere and the 'feel' for 1960's NYC. It isn't too much and it isn't too little. It felt real. The costume designs, the environment. They were all convincing.<br/><br/>I stopped watching Mad Men due to it's dull and mundane plot line at S03E02. I didn't get through the first two seasons by the story, like I should have, I got through them by escaping into the cool atmosphere Mad Men offered. <br/><br/>Overall, not a bad show but not a good one either. I wouldn't recommend it. <br/><br/>IMDb RATING: 6/10 - OKAY I will admit when I first turned on this show I wasn't sure if I liked it. I could appreciate the acting so I gave it a shot. I told myself I will watch the first season and make my judgement then.<br/><br/>I did just that and the more I watched the more I found myself drawn in to the story of every person. By the end of each episode I was begging for more! The idea of where they would go with the story and what would happen next filled my thoughts for hours on in.<br/><br/>This show brings so many things to the table than what most shows have to offer. They have captured the authentic feel of early 60's so beautifully but the shows brings much more to the table than great acting and authentic feel. It brings great writing, amazing directing, along with mystery, humor, romance, and many other feelings all in one show.<br/><br/>It's worth watching. It is prestigious, serious, influential, educative and real perspective of the western world in 60ies. From years of airing, Mad Men was hosted on TV in many Countries, and I never truly had interest to watch it. But, after so many reviews and wins it received, I finally give it a try. So, a month before I collected all 4 seasons and start to watch from beginning.<br/><br/>After the pilot I was automatically hooked, and watched continuously all of the seasons in less than 3 weeks. Of course I did not stopped on that. I start to read about it all over the Internet, and thinking on starting to collect gadgets if there is some. About the influence, it is hard to resist to not drink that Canadian Club whiskey or smoking Luckies, but I leave that blemish aside. But it is very alluring I admit.<br/><br/>I suppose that series have positive effect on using some of the elements in real life, and with such a style it is so tempting not to try.<br/><br/>Anyway after I saw how many international prizes series won, I agree that it deserved all of them. I may say that this is a real gold mine AMC made, as this network really proved to be maybe the best there is.<br/><br/>What fascinate me about this show are the true facts about advertising industry in real life. Some of the real life executives from advert agencies, witness the reality in how advertising industry behaved those days. Seems that it is all true, as they stated. It is great reflexion of the world of marketing and advertising then, but it is almost the same today.<br/><br/>I am a graphic designer and for me to be in a core of it left me with a real pleasure. I worked in marketing industry myself and must say that series impressed me not by fun, but with feel of reality.<br/><br/>Copywriting is area that always interested me, and was and still is desirable to work in, and here it is not just a reference to this kind of work, but educational and supportive for real life ideas. So bravo to that.<br/><br/>I assume that people involving with industry, found the same pleasure as I did.<br/><br/>But, even it is the most interesting part for me, the other aspects in series is also excellent. The lifestyle, family relations and personal relation/issues, are projected very well. Actually it gives great perspective on life in America during that period. I asked my mother as she was in her twenties linked to the plot, and she stated that it all looks and feel like true facts.<br/><br/>No wonder that series is so respected. But not by the audience that watch soaps or fast action fun shows. Mad Men is made for the serious audience, and its slow rhythm that many devoted to the super commercial genre stated seems because it is contrary to that junk. It is like comparing Bergman movies with Rambo.<br/><br/>I like the was how characters were developed, especially of Don Draper and Peggy Olson. This is why it is important to watch Mad Men from the start. When someone say that it is too slow I say wrong. It is spontaneous with rich texture and feeling of the characters. <br/><br/>Characters were gradually developed through the whole series.The costumes, music, photography and set are rich, and everything is so believable. And the real life facts were implemented very well (political scenes).<br/><br/>The script is great, and after I found that the creator is the same person that was involved in creating Sopranos it was clear that we have very serious series.<br/><br/>As a final and very important conclusion; the series could really help you to learn how to behave in real world, especially in the business field. And that's educational part added to the previous mentioned. Really important one indeed.<br/><br/>I am so happy that Mad Men will continue, and brings something valuable that is so rare this days on TV. With Sopranos, Breaking Bad and Boardwald Empire to name the few, it is a pleasure to have something precious to our intelligence in the sea of so many stupid TV shows. The majority of the reviewers are not from the USA and male. There is a lot of talk about its hidden depths and its realism. How it breathes life into a fascinating period of USA high flyers.<br/><br/>Personally I think that is rubbish. It's slow, tedious and the script is awful. The acting is wooden and half the actors seem to be told to take it slowly for the dramatic effect. Sadly that simply doesn't work.<br/><br/>This series is dull, meaningless and really patronising to its audience.<br/><br/>Watch the first in the series and if you like it then enjoy. If not don't continue as it doesn't get any better. I would sooner watch raindrops running down the window. Hailed as being as good as West Wing and the Sopranos I was drawn in to go and see this show. Alas it's not doing it for me. Apart from Joan Holloway there is no character I like. They're not funny, mysterious, smart or anything else interesting. Big hero Don Draper is not my kind of guy, too shallow and his back story too dull and predictable (I don't like Tony Soprano either but he's interesting too watch, as is the world around him). His wife is even worse. She is a spoiled waste with no other quality then being beautiful. Perhaps badly written as a quite desperation character caught in the times (60s)but she's hopelessly inadequate as a character (what would Cybil Shephard in her prime have done, more wit perhaps or a bit more depth or at least captivating). These people are supposed to be smart but not even in the current season (3) I have seen them do anything smart or say anything intelligent (this is certainly no West Wing level, scripting, it is not even on par with the final WW season). Actually the book by Ogilvie on Advertisement (mentioned in the series) is better written then any of this. Basically I have watched 3 seasons of soap opera with better sets and lightning, but certainly not more intriguing. If this was life at the beginning of the swinging sixties i'm glad my parents turned out all right. Top Five Overblown American Exports: The trailers are slick, the casts are strewn with A Listers and TV staples, the cinematography is of the highest calibre...Doh!-Someone forgot to include a decent storyline...<br/><br/>Starting from the top-<br/><br/>1 : Dirty Sexy Money 2 : Pushing Daisies 3 : Deadwood 4 : (Season 3) Desperate Housewives<br/><br/>And last of all - Mad Men. This is an artful case of style over content for me. Matthew Weiner, at best, seats somewhere between decent dialogue-driven writing, and plain old ponderous navel-gazing punctuated only by uneventful guff. Judging by the damage done with the last season of The Sopranos- its easy to see which side of that fence he's falling. <br/><br/>There is something inherently 'pleased with itself' in the style of American drama's these days. In much the same way as actors like Glenn Close try to fill a screen with their presence and hushed approach- 'look at me...I'm acting- I'm commanding your attention...watch me...ACT- observe my talent'. <br/><br/>Equally, whenever I watch something like Mad Men, I can almost hear the cogs in the writers brainstorm room clicking and whirring away, sending us the perceptible message - "yes...this is genius....my sociological wit....watch me write...look...Im WRITING...I can say so much in just a few lines of dialogue".<br/><br/>For one born with erectile tissue (I'm sorry....), I still cannot romanticise the righteous bragging, swaggering and plain sexist bullshitting that happily contradicted the literature, art and film making of the 60's. One only has to re-inter some of the 'great' taglines in popular magazines for a single month of this decade to realise how unavoidable this sad irony is. What is avoidable, however, is the need for patronising devices and crass quotes like- "It was like watching a DOG playing the piano" (when the female protagonist comes up with a good advertising concept) to clumsily hammer such points home.<br/><br/>Ever watched an old episode of The Rockford Files or Ironside, and marvelled at how they can cover all this social commentary and STILL fit an engaging story in there? If not, perhaps it's time you did. Call me old-fashioned, but I like to root for somebody. Instead, I had the "pleasure" of wasting an hour of my life on an amoral prick with a Beatnik Bimbo in the city and a clueless Marilyn Monroe look-a-like wife stashed in the burbs. His co-workers are even worse: the men are horny a-holes, and the women are bitchy sluts! In one episode, Joan, the head slut, tells Peggy, the a-hole wanna-be, to stop dressing like a schoolgirl if she wants the horny a-holes to take her seriously. So she crashes a "meeting" the horny a-holes are having at a strip club dressed like a slut! That the horny a-holes don't take Joan seriously, either, is completely lost on her!<br/><br/>As the show makes a big deal out of how "period" this was, I Googled the Reader's Digest article that had the characters' panties in a collective bunch. "Cancer by the Carton" warned that the new low-tar cigarettes which promised a "healthier smoke" were anything but. It was published in 1952 -- 8 years before the series is set!<br/><br/>At least the Big Tobacco Big Shot was right about the (pre-Columbian) Native Americans "giving us" tobacco. In case anyone cares, tobacco as used today was perfected by a Frenchman named Jean Nicot, for whom Nicotine was named. OK i know im in a minority not to think this series is genius but i am entitled to be wrong lol. The production values and attention to detail are superb, the representation of the style of dress, technology, and architecture are just gorgeous, but the story lines and plot have typical soap opera values which could easily crop up in eastenders or coronation street,both of which i find dull and boring, this is equally dull, it is so banal in its plot lines that all it has going for it is its good looks. Style over substance has never been more apt, my partner watches it and freely admits it is only for the clothes and style that she does so, otherwise its not very interesting, since the fashion angle has very limited appeal to me there is nothing i can find here to make me stick with it, the women are lovely to look at but i really need more than eye candy to maintain interest. I have just finished the final episode of the final series and I'm angry. <br/><br/>Many people mention how stylish this show is, and it is. There has been drama, sexiness and a few laughs against the backdrop of the advertising industry and the political events of the time period, all of which highlight the negatives of this "stylish" period.<br/><br/>The casting, acting and production design of the whole show is truly first-class.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed the first six seasons but I did often have the thought, "Where is this show going?", which is dangerous place to be. This thought was magnified in the final season, which was a HUGE disappointment that has left me regretting any time spent on it at all. Were the writers half asleep as they wrote it?!<br/><br/>The final seven episodes were the worst. A true endurance test. Waiting for something interesting to happen, my faith in the writers disintegrated as it was obvious that no pay-off would be worth the boredom I was enduring. Still, I stuck with it "for old time sake", appalled that Don Draper, the central character's storyline, became the most meandering, pointless and boring of the lot.<br/><br/>No amount of writer's justification about any kind of metaphor for life will excuse the waste of time that these last episodes were. Utterly unfulfilling. This show started off brilliantly, like edgy view of a period that is constantly being imagined as naive and kind. It's nicely lit and shot, acting is very good. First episode was brilliant, writing was razor sharp and well observed. <br/><br/>But during the first season, the show seemed to lost its focus. It sort of jumps between business, politics, personal lives and love affairs. It lacks consistency. None of these themes is fully approached and realized. I for one think it should focus a lot more on the business side of things. This way the show could work as a vehicle for revealing principles of advertising to the audience, which is bound to be interesting for the show's demographic. Too bad it doesn't. This show is both entertaining & exasperating at the same time. The setting is the 1950's when men were men & women were objects for the men. Watching this film it's so hard to believe how far we have come in the work place. I enjoy seeing just how desensitized women were back then. Being told to show more leg because your boss would like you better? Great line. Plus the smoking in every office, bathroom & elevator. I loved the scene where the ad men are trying to figure out what to do about the Surgeon General's report on Tobacco kills people. Then the smokers cough that follows while they are all meeting on it. Priceless. The other scene which really sticks out in my mind is the main ad man assuming the head of the major department store is the man whose been working at the agency for years because he just can't bring his brain to realize the other person in the room, The Woman, could be the owner of a large business. Great work. Then the ad man gets mad at the woman because she has her own ideas on how to run her own company. This was one of the best moments in this series so far. I am so looking forward to the next one. Why the hell all the characters are so slick and top models? There is no reflection of reality in this show. Visually, everything is perfect and beautiful, there's no fat ordinary people within the screen, they are mostly in their twenties and they act as if they all succeeded their careers. No credibility at all.<br/><br/>That's why the Sopranos were so successful: more reality of boring banality of life. There's only 12% of good looking people in population, how can we believe in this full-package-advertised-cliché Hollywoodian show? Nobody recognize himself in this varnished show. Where is the fatso plump secretary with her irritable manners and the bitch in the crowd? These characters are so perfect. They all look successful and over self-confident.<br/><br/>That detail is for me very important and tells me right away if this show deserves my time to watch it. Nowadays, the force is in the details. Insignificant becomes significant with the right usage. This show is predictable and we don't learn anything from it. With all the complexity of advertising from the second millennium, why the creator did not focus on the advertising of these days? That would be much more appreciable don't you think? Mad Men is a soporific show.<br/><br/>It's the reason why, in spite of repeated hype campaigns and many awards (clearly all you need to get an award these days is a big marketing campaign!) audiences still shun this bad, boring show.<br/><br/>Matthew Weiner apparently thinks a lot of his writing and he got 4 out of 5 nominations for Best Writer at the Emmys, but what it really shows is not quality, rather the fact that the Emmys are entirely disconnected with quality of what is really good writing.<br/><br/>It's very sad that so much ink is wasted on this bad show.<br/><br/>AMC should have put its money behind something actually good. This unique series from AMC needs a few qualifiers. The first is, you can't watch just one episode from the middle of a season and form an opinion about it. Taken out of context, an individual episode will seem mildly interesting for the costumes and hairstyles, but for most viewers, it will be slow and dull entertainment.<br/><br/>The beauty of "Mad Men" lies in what's under the surface, the subtext, and that can only be appreciated by watching the entire series, starting at the beginning.<br/><br/>"Mad Men" starts in 1960. The period has been duplicated with 99.99% accuracy. The missing 0.1% is that a) though IBM Selectric typewriters are shown in 1960, they weren't introduced until 1961; and b) Don Draper (Jon Hamm) in 1962 is 36 years old, which leads one to wonder why he was in Korea and not WWII. There's a third thing from season 3 that I won't mention right now. The hair, the clothes, the smoking, the drinking, the littering, the references, having Jean Shrimpton in an ad, the products - Mohawk Airlines, Utz, etc., the huge copy machine, the Catholics, the Latin Mass, the rampant sexism, the kids in front of the TV, the programs - phenomenal. When the firm is called in to work on a Sunday, and a priest stops by Peggy's (Elizabeth Moss) house, her mother says she's sick. Why? Catholics aren't supposed to work on Sunday. I love it.<br/><br/>The characters inside and out of Sterling and Cooper: There's the handsome, mysterious, conflicted and private Don Draper (Jon Hamm) who's a brilliant ad man and loyal to his clients to boot; his Grace Kelly-ish wife (January Jones) who smokes, drinks wine, and goes to a psychiatrist; Peggy, a gal with a big secret and a big brain, who is trying to fit into a man's world; Sterling (John Slattery, who auditioned for his role 9 times), full of wit, heart problems, and women; Cooper (Robert Morse), old but shrewd; Joan (Christina Hendricks), the va-va-va voom secretarial supervisor; the wormy Pete Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser); the closeted Salvatore Romano (Bryan Batt), and many others, all interesting and all fleshed out.<br/><br/>Some of the lesser characters "put on" the '60s style and don't inhabit their characters. But you won't find that in the major actors. Hamm is extremely internalized and may seem like he's not doing much, but when Don Draper blows a fuse, you know he's coming from a real place. It's a subtly powerful characterization. Slattery is great, as is Batt, Kartheiser, Morse and the rest of the ad men. Moss is also giving a deeply internalized performance - the character of Peggy is hard to read, as she should be. January Jones does a marvelous job as Don's unpredictable and unhappy wife, and she's stunningly beautiful to boot.<br/><br/>I saw one episode from season 2 in August and wasn't impressed. When I started watching the Netflix disks at a friend's house, I couldn't stop. Mad Men has a unique power all its own. It's not easily appreciated; it's not for people who want something obvious that they don't have to think about. It's for people who want to become completely lost in this world and absorbed in its characters. It's also a trip down memory lane for those of us who remember the '60s. Like the agency of Sterling and Cooper, "Mad Men" is not for everybody. However, it's definitely for me, and I'm addicted. HBO would have never allow to screen a show so lifeless and dull. I have to admit that a was a little bit curios after watching the first episode but from then on it was a complete downfall. They must have spent a fortune in pay off to get such good reviews from the various magazines and papers. There's no much else to say but i've got to reach the 10 lines of text to post this i'll keep repeating then. HBO would have never allow to screen a show so lifeless and dull. I have to admit that a was a little bit curios after watching the first episode but from then on it was a complete downfall. They must have spent a fortune in pay off to get such good reviews from the various magazines and papers. I think it's one of the darkest and best expositions of the end of the Eisenhower years, and before Kennedy, womens' lib and civil rights. There were very few beacons of light for advertising in this time of stultifying big agencies. My friends at Doyle, Dane Berbach were the only ones having fun. There was plenty of talent around everywhere but hard and fast rules didn't allow it to flourish. The enigma of Don Draper is so intriguing and it gets more interesting every week. Last week's episode was particularly fine. His wife's need for him was handled so tenderly and that view into his feelings for his younger brother at his birth made me dislike Don for the first time, not because of his pretense and infidelities, but because of his inability to feel anything. Mad Men is The Great Gatsby Part 2 04-15-17 Most of us have heard the maxim, "nothing new under the sun." Perhaps more germane to my topic, "there are only thirty-nine story plots that get recycled endlessly." Mad Men, Matt Weiner's brilliant TV drama, (set in 1960s New York, on Madison Ave., global advertising's headquarters at the time), echoes Scott Fitzgerald's great American novel, The Great Gatsby.<br/><br/>I think I want to say, as a characterization of Mr. Weiner's astounding achievement in dramatic entertainment, that Mad Men is The Great Gatsby Part 2.<br/><br/>Here's the gist of my argument: Comparison of the Characters Don Draper, a masquerading James Bond of Madison Ave., follows in a direct line of descent from Jay Gatsby, a masquerading Ernest Hemingway of West Egg.<br/><br/>Pete Campbell, a patrician brat-boy of New York, follows in a direct line of descent from Tom Buchanan, a patrician wastrel of East Egg.<br/><br/>Roger Sterling, an insider frat-boy of Madison Ave., follows in a direct line of descent from Nick Carraway, an insider trader of West Egg.<br/><br/>Betty Hofstadt (Draper), a cover-girl blonde of the social-climbing middle-class, follows in a direct line of descent from Daisy Buchanan, a cover-girl blonde of the social-climbing mid-west.<br/><br/>Comparison of Situations Jay Gatsby, a penniless man without a family, gloms onto an upscale mentor who examples for him the good life of the ideal man.<br/><br/>Dick Whitman, a penniless man without a family, steals the identity of Don Draper, whom he fashions into the dashing image of the ideal man.<br/><br/>Comparison of the Writers Fitzgerald/Weiner Objective - Examination of the American Dream Fitzgerald/Weiner Conclusion - The American Dream is a sparkling bauble, just out of reach Comparison of Relationships Nick Carraway, an upscale insider who is an underachiever, has Gatsby's back on matters of culture & decorum. Caraway, a conventional stuffed shirt, marvels at Gatsby's reckless romanticism.<br/><br/>Roger Sterling, an upscale insider who is a man child, has Draper's back on matters of culture & decorum. Sterling, a conventional stuffed shirt, marvels at Draper's reckless adventurism.<br/><br/>Comparison of Time Periods The American 1920s & the American 1960s mirror each other. During both decades, American pop culture slipped out from under the watchful eye of Puritan morality. Each time, legions of young adults turned on to intoxications while embracing free love.<br/><br/>Jay Gatsby & Don Draper are the two monumental frauds who embodied, with sparkling gusto, the fleeting ecstasy of temporary good times. This show catches a lot of heat from people in my age range (early 20's). If you ask me, this is a great show.<br/><br/>First off, it's a period piece. If it makes you uncomfortable glimpsing into the sexual and racial tensions of the 60's and early 70's, go watch Big Bang Theory or something. The show is a glimpse into office life culture of the time. Being mad at this show for being racist or sexist is like being mad at Shakespeare for using old English...it's just how it was at the time! It doesn't make it right, it's just how it WAS.<br/><br/>The story arc follows the protagonist (possibly anti-hero?) Don Draper through his personal life as well as his office life at the ad agency "Sterling-Cooper" (undergoes many name changes). Don is deeply flawed. He has a hidden identity, he drinks and smokes like a sailor, he is unfaithful in his marriages, yet there is still something respectable and intriguing about him. Some episodes also focus on the equally intriguing supporting cast (also mostly employees of the ad agency).<br/><br/>The acting is first rate. My favorite actors are obviously Jon Hamm who plays the main character Don Draper, John Slattery who plays Roger Sterling, and January Jones who plays Betty Draper-Ford to a TEE. Those are just my favorite actors and actresses, but the entire cast is great all around. It's impressive and is definitely helped by a strong core team of writers.<br/><br/>If the content doesn't turn off viewers, I'm sure the content could do the job. The plot can meander sometimes and is overly cryptic at times (regarding Don's personal life), humor can be dry (though hilarious), and the plot lines take a while to resolve themselves. It's a very involved show that demands your attention because if you don't pay attention, you'll lose track of what's going on really easily. Despite all these things, it's fascinating to follow Don's crazy life and the exploits and inner workings of the ad agency (at least for me it is).<br/><br/>Good series and definitely worth the watch! - Jack Not that would make a difference to anyone who decided this show is not worth their time, but I would advise all of you who say you can't see what the hype is about this show, to try watching it again. But this time concentrated, without any distractions, paying attention to what is said, but also to what is not said. Cause one of the greatest beauties of this series is how much it is said with out saying. Everything is so real, and I'm not talking about the reconstruction of the era (which is almost flawless) but about the characters. They are real people with real people's dreams, fears, anxieties, hopes... Definitely the best series I have ever watched. It is worth every second. Worth watching it again and again, because you'll always find some detail that you might have missed the first time. I tuned into this show to see what all the hype was about by renting the first couple of episodes. <br/><br/>By the third episode, enough was enough.<br/><br/>If you are into listening to people drone on and on all the while puffing on cigarettes, then this is for you. I use to smoke myself, but every single scene has someone lighting up. It would be interesting to know who the target audience is that is giving this show the rating, such as it is here on IMDb. <br/><br/>The cigarette companies perhaps? <br/><br/>Utter garbage. BEST SHOW EVER MADE GOR TELEVISION!!! I LOVED EVERY SINGLE EPISODE!! I think each of the main characters ultimately achieved what they were looking for. Except Betty. While not the most sympathetic character, I think her cancer was just shown to be a random event (as random as can be when a whole population chain-smokes, that is). I wasn't sure where things were going when Don Draper followed Stephanie Horton to a new-age retreat. His phone "confession" to Peggy Olsen left me wondering if he was ready to end it all.<br/><br/>Then came a group encounter session which, I think, was the best scene in the entire series.<br/><br/>Another man takes a chair at the session and relates how he has felt invisible his entire life. How when he would come home, no one would even look up at him. "They should love me. Maybe they do, but I don't even know what it is. You spend your whole life thinking you're not getting it, people aren't giving it to you, then you realize they're trying and you don't even know what it is." How he had a dream of living in the dark in a refrigerator, beaming to the smiling faces he sees when people open the door and the light goes on, just to realize that they don't see him and the door shuts again.<br/><br/>I think while Don is hearing this, he is seeing two big facets of his life. How others were trying but he didn't see it, and how he was the one opening the refrigerator door, only to close it again on everyone in his life.<br/><br/>This finally broke Don, and he crossed the room to embrace the man in a moment of catharsis.<br/><br/>There are a million different ways this show could've ended. I'm satisfied with the conclusion. Draw your own about Don and whether he brainstormed the famous "I'd like to teach the world to sing" Coke ad. The finale allowed us imagination to decide how those former Sterling, Cooper and Partners lives would continue. To me, everything is good, except for a nagging feeling that Pete Campbell's Lear jet never made it to Wichita. What makes this show great isn't the acting, the pace, the writing, the sets, the character arcs, the relationships, the music or the metaphors. It's you. It's the only show I've ever seen and I've seen many in which the viewer plays a real role. You will get as much out of it as what you put in. I've spent too long to record rewatching the series and each time I notice new things, glean something from a performance I didn't the first, second or third times, appreciate a storyline more deeply or simply see the Mad Men world in a new coat of paint. If you start watching and several episodes deep you discard it as "boring" then your ability to relate to the show is severely lacking, and you will never understand it. In a way though, I'm still not sure I fully understand it. Is it a series about advertising execs in the 60s? Possibly. But not really. All those elements I mentioned at the beginning are up there with the best on television, especially the writing which could very well be the best there has ever been. If you know what it's like to be truly lonely, out of place, to run and go nowhere, this peerless show should bring you to your knees. It's damn good drama. Truly addictive once you start and has a fantastic ending, keeps you guessing and is very cleverly written. Would definitely recommend Top 10 TV show without doubt!
Top 5 American Fiction! I was previously aware of the show, but being in lock-down made me binge 7 seasons and it is pretty much a masterpiece.
The show has a skillful blend of humour and sadness and plenty to say about people and society.
The characters have good moments and bad and the 60s setting adds another level to the already intricate story of ppls lives. Its a must watch. Stylish and well crafted, and possessing one of the best performances by an actor (Jon Hamm) that I have seen in a TV series. Yet, the show also dragged at times, which is why it took me nearly two years to watch the entire thing. (Though I always felt compelled to keep watching.) The final episode unfortunately, brought me only a little bit of satisfaction. This show is just, beyond words how well made, thoughtful, just
Honestly, just put in on. Start from the beginning. Its a god damn cinematic treasure. I grew up in that era and people ask me today why I started smoking. They need only to watch this show to get their answer. It's like going through the reel of my mind and reminding me of what it was like. A lot I had forgotten until now. Although a lot of the societal beliefs are unbelievable by today's standards it was strangely familiar and comforting to me as I was watching this series, only because it validates my memories of that time. I wouldn't want to relive it. This 7 season mosaic is not for distracted viewing or people who think television can't be literature. You have to really pay attention. But the payoff is real. Without a doubt the finest show in television history and believe it or not, it gets better with every viewing.<br/><br/>If you are really curious, Matt Zoller Seitz' brilliant anthology on the show (episode by episode - book on Amazon) is an amazing way to make the viewing experience even more rewarding. Like Cheever or Updike but on TV. Everything else on tv now feels flat to me. One of the most poignant and emotional episodes of television I've watched in a long time. I think having the back drop of the Muhammad Ali vs Sonny Liston rematch is perfect for this episode. The whole way through Don is dealing with the thought that his closest friend in the world has died. He doesn't know it for certain yet, but he delays the inevitable by not returning a call straight away.<br/><br/>Why is the boxing used so perfectly? Because this classic heavyweight match up is a perfect metaphor for what's going on in Don's head the whole episode. Sonny Liston was a classic power puncher, known as one of the hardest punchers in heavyweight history, he would often bulldoze through his opponents. Muhammad Ali was not a classic power-puncher, he was a boxer, and a boxer that turned the sport into an art form. He would dance around the ring, avoiding a huge number of punches. To me, Liston represents Don trying to maintain his stiff upper lip. He's trying to put the thought of this phone call to the back of his head and tries to carry on with his work as normal. This is something Don tends to adopt the majority of the way through the series, and the fact that he bets on Liston to win the fight I think adds to this.<br/><br/>However, Muhammad Ali wins the fight. I think Ali represents the more emotional side of Don, the art form of what Ali does represents Draper's sensitive side. They're ultimately in conflict, but Don truly believes that his stronger less emotional side will win, hence why he bets $100 on Liston winning. But Ali wins. Draper's true emotions win. Despite him yelling at the radio telling Liston to 'get up', Ali wins.
This ultimately leads Don to the realisation that he needs to face the situation head on. So he makes the call, and yes, his best friend has died. And we see Don cry for the first time that I can remember (I may be wrong).<br/><br/>Mad Men is centred around a very macho industry, and Don feels the need to maintain that machismo, but sometimes, the mask slips and he becomes very vulnerable. It proves that sometimes, you can be desperate for Liston to win, but Ali always finds a way. The only thing good that comes from Mad Men is the following, costumes, set design (backdrop), music, acting-that's it! I appreciate and respect that they chose this era and that it is precise. But I have no idea why there is so much hype over this show, maybe because everyone that loves it are soap opera gossiping schmucks. The pilot was one of the most terrible pilots I have seen, it was boring and didn't give me a hook. I continued to watch it to give it another chance but it did not improve, maybe its just me but I couldn't care less about this cliché soap opera. And the other thing that is overrated is the writing, I can come up with something better! if you really want to watch a phenomenal drama that is not overrated but should be is, DAMAGES, Breaking Bad, Six Feet Under, Dead Wood, and Fringe. Spoilers!!! Okay, I'm just going to say it. Don Draper is awful. He is a scumbag. A lot of people praise Mad Men for the "complexity" of this character, but in all honesty he bas got to be one of the worst characters in television. Not only is he totally okay with betraying his wife several times, no he also has the audacity to act out if someone calls him out on it (the comedian from season 2). Also he is fine with telling an emotional story (about his family which he has no empathy for) just to sell a product (The Kodak Carousel). After the divorce from his wife he continues to be terrible. Remember he is quite passive as his increasingly psychotic wife ruins the life of their children. He must have noticed something (his daughter running away from home to be with him or her being forced to visit a psychiatrist). But to his credit he ain't the only horrid character. Nobody has positive traits. The story stays the same. The only somewhat likable person who develops throughout the story is Peggy and that is unfortunately not enough to hold up seven seasons. After hearing so many great things about MAD MEN and enjoying AMC's BREAKING BAD so much I bought the first 2 seasons of the show before watching a single episode. How could I go wrong with so much positive press on this series? After watching a couple of episodes I was a bit baffled on why this series got the praise it does. I decided that perhaps the early episodes were laying the ground work for the greatness to come. Well, I only have a few more episodes left to watch of the first season and I'm very surprised and disappointed that what I've seen thus far is about as good as it's going to get.<br/><br/>I figured it must be me because so many rave about this show. I don't know anyone personally that watches it but the reviews are always stellar. So I came here to see what others think. While I'm a bit relived to see not everyone thinks so highly of the show, I'm also a bit surprised so many like it.<br/><br/>MAD MEN isn't a bad show. There's stuff to like about it. It's slick, looks great, if you're familiar with that time period I suppose there's a lot to be fun to watch, it's subtle, it's a bit different that the norm on TV these days, and it's smartly written. In fact I'd say MAD MEN has everything going for it to deserve it's hype except for one critical element: IT ISN'T EXCITING! It isn't intense. It's fairly dull. The stories just lack kick and excitement. There are times when it looks like something exciting is about to happen and it never really does. There are times when it seems like something sexy is about to happen and the scene fades and moves to something else. I keep expecting a big reveal to happen to the characters and it never quite happens. To me MAD MEN isn't the type of show that has me can't waiting to see the next episode. To me MAD MED is a visually slick show that may be smartly written but is merely okay in what it delivers.<br/><br/>I'm not surprised the show gets high marks from some people. What I'm surprised about is "how many" people give it high marks. I thought viewers in general would demand something with more exciting moments and/or "bigger" stories.<br/><br/>Again, I don't think it's a "bad" show. For me it just doesn't deliver on the hype story-wise. I'll finish watching the two seasons I bought but unless that second season is drastically different from the first that will be it for me and I wouldn't recommend this show to anyone I know unless they're really into that era. Mad Men is set in 1960, not the 1950s. The Surgeon General's Report on Smoking came out in 1964. <br/><br/>The research report in the first episode was done by the advertising firm. When Don Draper throws the folder with the report into the wastebasket the scene is accurate. The tobacco companies had information on how lethal cigarettes were but suppressed it. This trashing of the uncomfortable truth to protect an advertising client gets added force when Don is doing his push ups before getting into bed with his wife. He wants to be fit yet doesn't know what he does almost every time we see him is roasting his lungs and hurting his heart. <br/><br/>Seconds later, he wonders why his wife doesn't think she is happy even though she is surrounded by material comforts. He has bought her a watch, thinking that should help her. She feels that the numbness in her hands is psychological. So, she goes to an analyst, an option for an upper middle-class woman. According to the publicity article for the series, it was a trend among women then. Was that trend reflecting the feeling many women had of being unfulfilled, not having careers outside of their homes? <br/><br/>This thought brings me to the scene which sticks out most in my mind. That is where Sally, the Draper's little daughter, is scolded by her mother for having a plastic bag over her head. Ignoring the threat of suffocation, Mrs. Draper tells Sally that, if that bag was used to hold one of mother's dresses she will be sorry. Nothing could affect her wardrobe, her appearance, her Barbie Doll in the affluent suburb life.<br/><br/>But much of the story and the characters is about superficiality, making good impressions. That's a major part of advertising. This is especially true in the scene where Don is asked if any Jews had worked there. He answers "Not on my watch." We don't know if he said that because he was anti-Semitic or was just stating a fact. But they know that they must make a good impression for some Jewish clients.<br/><br/>But Don Draper is the core of the plot. He is the sturdy base, the even keel who keeps the sometimes unruly bunch of admen and the new secretary who makes a play for him on the straight path. He turns down an invitation to a bachelor party, lectures a young co-worker on his behavior but keeps up a secret affair. He is the man of mystery, unknown to even his wife, the blank page. He doesn't vote, shows no enthusiasm for his firm choosing to work for Nixon's campaign. <br/><br/>The story is set at an interesting time. It is early 1960, a transition period, the dawning of an as yet unseen sexually liberated age. The young woman who has just come to work at the office is prescribed a new invention, the birth control pill. She is lectured by her doctor not to use the pill as an excuse for sex before marriage. But that night she does just that. The birth control pill was introduced as a remedy for menstrual problems. It's manufacturers knew how controversial an oral contraceptive could be. Yes, I like this TV drama that much. Well-drawn characters, clever plot turns, and great sense of period. The way the show uses the period to bring home dramatic points really impresses me. For example, in the first episode, Don Draper plays as if he were a single man. (When he turns down Peggy Olson's advances it is only because of their work relationship, he says.) Then Draper goes home to his wife and two children. On the soundtrack, Vic Damone sings "On the Street Where You Live," the perfect irony for a man whose street where he lives has nothing to do with the romance in the song, yet there is something poignant about playing that song while Draper sinks into the domestic side of his double life.<br/><br/>I won't give too much away, but by the third episode I realized that ad man Draper is the embodiment of the image-manipulation he does for others; he is his own best advertisement in that he has manipulated and disguised his own image. Unfortunately for him, his disguise is not as perfect as he thinks and is likely to come undone before very long.<br/><br/>By the way, for those who think this show is not set in the 1950s: In the middle of the first episode, Peggy looks at a wall calendar and it says March 1960. That means that only three months earlier it was 1959! Do you know who was president of the United States in March 1960? Eisenhower. The same president since 1953. In March 1960, no one knew what the sixties were going to be like. They really had not begun yet. Well, OK, the world was already sticking its big toe into the sixties, but that is as far as it had gone. Mad Men is one absolutely superb show! Set in 1960, the show chronicles an America that, on the surface, seemed idyllic, but which in reality was already troubled because of its regressive attitudes. Political correctness didn't exist as a concept, hence the open prejudice.<br/><br/>One fascinating aspect of the show is how I found the characters relatively unsympathetic. The corporate environment is hardly that of the Broadway musical, "How to Succeed In Business Without Really Trying," and this deserves to be mentioned because of the presence of its star, Robert Morse, whose presence seems a welcome one.<br/><br/>That said, the performers are outstanding. The characters they play are deeply flawed, and they seem so painfully real. If there are flaws in continuity, such as the typewriters used, it hardly matters when the story lines are so compelling. The ending of the final episode of Season 1 seems fitting, in that what can go around does come around.<br/><br/>I look forward to Season 2! Being in the industry (and having had a father who was a war veteran and a CD at places like Lennon & Newell and Grey back in those days), I can confidently say that Mad Men gets it right.<br/><br/>I remember visiting my father's office as a young kid, remember the comps with several layers of see-through pad paper (even the look of the illustrations are pretty spot-on), the boys club aspect of these places, the competition between DDB and everywhere else, the copywriters who grew beards and goatees and all had novels in their desks (one of our family friends became a popular novelist), and how all the creatives dressed up in suits for work everyday.<br/><br/>A lot has changed.<br/><br/>After many sad attempts of using the advertising industry as simply a backdrop (Melrose Place, Good Company), it's nice to see a show that integrates how the "work" is actually done instead of just showing everyone carrying around storyboards. While it's not the main crux of Mad Men (really, it's another nighttime soap opera), it does lend an air of authenticity. When I saw one of the early episodes of Mad Men (rather by accident) I was completely blown away. The meticulously drafted script, the sensitive portrayal of the characters, which allows you to sense many layers of a personality, the make up, the fashion, the decor etc. everything was so carefully designed and crafted. Most interestingly was the perspective on the 1960 era: the different mind-set of the people, the values, the men-women-interaction. It makes you feel like a social anthropologist studying another culture, which it was to some extent. I got pulled into the maelstrom of "Mad Man" -so was my husband. Every episode was a pleasure to watch. Looking forward to the next season. I honestly must say that I'm shocked to read so many bad reviews of this show. It seems that when something receives a lot of hype, new viewers are suddenly just itching to knock it down a peg, if only to show that they're keeping up with their Entertainment Weekly subscriptions.<br/><br/>If you are coming in on Season 2 and have missed the entire precedent for it, then yes, you're bound to be bemused and somewhat irritated. If your attention span doesn't exceed three episodes time, maybe stick to Grey's Anatomy. If you're completely incapable of appreciating subtlety and reading between the lines of artfully written dialogue, this show will drive you, well, mad. And, if you are focusing too much on the "fetishistic" attention to detail in the production design, you're probably missing out on all the good stuff.<br/><br/>I will be the first to note that the pilot episode is more caricature than satire, but things do become vastly more nuanced as the show and its character's evolve. Also, whether or not people want to acknowledge it, many of the troubling issues addressed on Mad Men are still relevant to the modern American. Obviously not to the degree they once were, but perhaps that makes it even more important for contemporary society to be bedeviled by yesteryear's Zeitgeist  lest we forget. Additionally, one of the most prominent and compelling themes in the show is that of the American dream, and that will remain highly-combustible dramatic fodder long after this ol' empire smolders.<br/><br/>Not only are the issues taxing, but the characters are not readily accessible and easy to like. In fact, there isn't one character on the show to speak of who isn't without fault. Does that mean they are devoid of any redeeming qualities? No. But, if you're only willing to watch superficially, you won't be allowing yourself to delve deeper into each character's quirks and personal challenges.<br/><br/>A lot of people are cutting down Jon Hamm in their comments, and call me (quite literally) the devil's advocate, but I think Don Draper is brilliantly portrayed. Draper is a man who likes to believe he has each type of person pegged  and, it cannot be denied that he has an uncanny clairvoyance when it comes to peoples' actions and desires - but in actuality, he is constantly being surprised by those around him. Such is the duality of his nature, because he doesn't even quite have himself figured out. He frowns down upon behaviors of which he himself is patently guilty, such as the deceitfulness of his father, the wandering search for affection of his wife Betty, the arrogance of his coworkers, etc. He projects an image of control, but the only thing he's really successful at is selling images. A man like that isn't serene or truly confident; he is constantly in a state of emergency (perhaps, hence the many references to Frank O'Hara's introvertive, yet guarded poem throughout Season 2.) If you are ill at ease with Hamm's performance, that is most likely the desired result.<br/><br/>In regards to the rest of the cast, they are predominantly luminous. I am impressed over and over again with the performances of John Slattery, Elisabeth Moss, and especially Vincent Kartheiser, (whose commentary on the Season 1 DVD I found particularly insightful.) It seems that for many of the same reasons people are griping about the show, I find it to be starkly true-to-life and affecting. Most people don't refurbish the shortcomings of their consciences overnight, if ever. Most people are desperately flawed, most people have some unsavory characteristics and most people are completely inept/dumbfounded in at least one arena of their lives. However, if you TRULY devote some real time and attention to this show, you'll cull a better understanding of why the characters do the things they do, and how many of them are simply buying or selling an image which is completely opposite from what they aspire to internally.<br/><br/>P.S. I was born in 1986, so I can't vouch for the realism of the atmosphere, but that seems to be one thing most of the critics generally agree on as a virtue of the show. All I can say is, I'm infatuated. Don is a bigger scumbag than ever. Pete is even more annoying and hateful. Peggy is still whining, unhappy, and unfulfilled. By now, all of this is very tiresome. I stopped watching after season 6, episode 3.<br/><br/>The only good thing was Joan's retort after that fat client from Jaguar said to her "I'm sure there's a part of you that misses me." She said, without missing a beat, "And I'm sure there's a part of you that you haven't seen in years." I love Joan. She is the only character worth watching.<br/><br/>Mad Men has gone the way of so many other excellent TV shows before it. I noticed that with "Weeds," "Six Feet Under," "The Sopranos," and others, that they lost excellence after the third season. Guess it's time for me to search around for something else. Any ideas, readers? No other show has hooked me this quickly and thoroughly since the Sopranos. I do not watch much television due to most of the shows being mediocre at best. This show excels and the writers and actors are top notch. The show took me in from episode one. Even some of the best shows out there take time to hit their stride. Mad Men just throws you right in. Fully fleshed out characters both complex and deeply analyzed. I am not from the high ball era. I was born in the 70's. However; growing up I remember a time before the electronic/ computer age and it is a refreshing view full of nostalgia for anyone who remembers a time BEFORE cell phones. A world that no longer exist and both the good parts and not so good parts. The actor who portrays Mr. Draper inhabits his character so thoroughly and effortlessly. Definitely Emmy worthy Mad Men has restored my faith in television. Amidst the thorns and thistles of reality shows, entertainment 'news', and schlubby sitcoms; here is, finally, a drama to celebrate. <br/><br/>This program, though relatively slow-paced, in the eyes of most TV connoisseurs, keeps the viewer completely captivated through intricate plot lines and honey-drizzled dialogue. (Not to mention the fact that it's set in such a stylish time and location - the whole thing is pure, decadent eye candy!) But Mad Men's delicious setting just seems like the cherry on top, when you consider this: The characters are extremely well-developed - in other words - not just cardboard cutouts placed around the main actor (the incredible Jon Hamm) in order to create a 'world' for him. This cast is astoundingly talented; and because of their dazzling performances (coupled with the amazing writing staff), we can see the humanity within every one of these people - each with their own secrets and desires, and we can empathize with them. Yes, even with the notorious Peter Cambell (my personal favorite; and simply a brilliant performance by Vincent Kartheiser) both in his trying to establish a place of importance (through unfavourable means) and his personal failings. <br/><br/>No one is perfect - and everyone has secrets. It's just nice to finally have a show that acknowledges the facts of life. Such a well - written and stylish one too. I watched the director and actors talk about the filming of Mad Men and the early 60's cultural context of the series. The director of this excellent show is right some situations have indeed remained the same even until this day. I worked in large corporate legal firms in Boston in the 1970's up to 2004. In very similar ways I can relate to a corporate environment which spanned decades. Much was like the machinations of the Sterling Cooper firm.<br/><br/>In one of my first comments about the series I sanctimoniously breathed a sigh of relief that thankfully I was working and living at a time in which those types of behaviors would not be sanctioned. The director, however, says yes, things changed but they also remained the same. This too is true. Still, I do believe profound changes have occurred so that heretofore powerless people now have at least SOME recourse. <br/><br/>Talk shows such as Oprah and many others make the once psychologically cornered person know that they are not alone and that they can exert at least some control to change their condition. The huge difference between the eras, I believe, is that we are allowed to at least TALK about things that heretofore were taboo. In the era of the late 50's and early 60's in which I grew up there was little talk or just a hint of talk but only on a psychiatrist's or analyst's couch which had just become fashionable and only for the well-to-do. Certainly there was not much introspection among persons in authority. Most definitely powerful men had to answer to nearly no one. Questioning authority is not the exception now it is the rule. Some of the absolutely vile, impertinent and condescending comments of those powerful men at Sterling Cooper towards especially the powerless women they work, have sex and live with would not fly. The courts are flooded with discrimination suits which attest to that fact.<br/><br/>While it is true human beings are human beings at all times, the social metamorphosis of the late 60's which encompassed the women's movement, the black movements, homosexuals and the like have given at least some voice and power over those strictly white men who once upon a time had usurped it all. Best of all at least in Boston one can barely find a place to smoke. That change saved lives. <br/><br/>I absolutely adore this show. It am transfixed! I heard a lot about this show so decided to give it a try. But all my expectations fell apart in pilot episode. Most of the characters are annoying. Lead actor is confused. I only watched 2 episodes of first season & if someone asks me what happened in those two episodes I can't answer coz nothing really happened. I read lot of reviews saying Mad men is not for all people. I get that now. Before stating this show, I finished sons of anarchy. One of the most brutal shows on tv. That might have affected my opinion. & I like thriller shows like breaking bad, got, narcos where something exciting happens in each episodes unlike mad men. So if your taste is same as mine don't bother watching mad men. Get rid of the sex, smoking and drinking and this could be a one season show Review after Season 4: Season 4 of Mad Men is every TV fanatic's dream. Mad Men loses its slow pace in season 4 and dives into the most brilliant Season for a TV drama ever! I normally put off watching Mad Men until the season is over (like I've been putting off Breaking Bad). But this season, I could not wait for the next episode!<br/><br/>I had to watch it! It was just filmed, written, and acted beautifully. If you have never seen Mad Men and was turned off by the first few seasons, PLEASE and I'm on my knees here WATCH SEASON 4. I gave it 10/10.<br/><br/>Overview after Season 3: The story follows Don Draper: a man's man the alpha male of the 60s advertising agency. From my former boss, I've learned that Mad Men most likely stands for Madison Ave Men, referring to the street in New York.<br/><br/>I must be honest, the show is very slow. You have to be in the mood to watch this. This is an AMC show and it's faster than AMC's other show Breaking Bad but around the pace of every other HBO show.<br/><br/>Smoking and drinking during work and the outfits are some of the fine detail that makes this show artful and beautiful. Christina Hendrix's character Joan is possibly one of the most charming and deep characters in the show. She's a strong female character of the 60s, and yet one that knows where she stands in society and still pushes for herself within the boundaries of her time line.<br/><br/>Plus she makes curvy women look really, really sexy.<br/><br/>Mad Men are for those who love television drama, those who love costumes and art intertwined with entertainment. This is for those who love Oscar movies, because there's a lot of subtle and slow scenes that tells you so much about the characters and helps with the development of the plot. I honestly don't understand why people watch this show. The writing is terrible, the acting is stale and the subject matter is dull. The only feature of Mad Men that is positive is the eye candy, and even then they couldn't make the gorgeous women less attractive if they tried.<br/><br/>I gave Mad Men a full season to improve, hoping that it was one of those shows that needs to lay ample groundwork; however the more of the godawful backstory that was uncovered, the worse the show became.<br/><br/>I honestly can't blame the actors for the acting. As they say, you can't polish a turd, and with the incredibly slow pace and the bad writing, they have NOTHING to work with.<br/><br/>As to the setting, exactly how many hours of screen time do they need to devote to telling us that advertisers lie and mislead? I'm not one of those viewers who watches each episode with a notepad and a stopwatch, but I'd guess 20-30% of each episode is devoted to it. ENOUGH ALREADY! All in all, I'd say this show is a little like "The Godfather," in that there's about twice as much airtime as there is story. However, unlike The Godfather, Mad Men's story is just not good. Now that I've seen Season 4 on DVD I am happy to say that this is the best Season so far of this great television series. Bravo! AMC. Previous seasons had their ups and downs but the 2010 season is truly great television drama. It is often hilariously funny, but the humor is very dry as a rule and the gags can flit by unnoticed if you don't pay attention. <br/><br/>Jon Hamm has turned into a great actor, and he's a great comedian. He embodies this character completely now and his performances in Season 4 are wide-ranging, from subtle comedy and perfect timing to intense inward, heart-wrenching situations. He is mining new depths of his character's path through life and it is fascinating and often moving to watch him at work. I wasn't sure Hamm had it in him after the first 3 seasons. But the scriptwriters hadn't consistently hit their stride until this last season. All of the actors have a lot more great dialogue to work with than before. Elisabeth Moss's Peggy Olson has made a quantum leap with her character, she is still, next to Hamms' Don Draper, the most interesting of a large and gifted cast.<br/><br/>Outstanding, are Jay E. Ferguson as Stan Rizzo, the new art director. He is a perfect foil for Peggy. As the shows progressed the scenes between them were always outstanding in their comedy. And dear Miss Blankenship! God bless her. She is the ribald element in the season and there is also something deeply moving about her life by the end of Season 4. <br/><br/>Characters come and go, some quite suddenly, and new ones added. Mad Men also brings back people from earlier seasons, like Midge from the first season. This sense that all of the characters are still alive and out there in Manhattan is a great factor in creating the very realistic, beautifully set and filmed recreation of the 1960s on Madison Avenue.<br/><br/>The cast has evolved after 4 seasons into a very tightly knit ensemble, it's almost Shakespearean at times. Some of the greatest scenes are those involving a close encounter of a non-sexual nature. They peel away layers of themselves before our eyes and it is never boring. As for the over-hyped sex scenes all I can say is that they are mild, though suggestive in a non-vulgar manner, and don't last long. It's not all heaving sheets and panting, though there is some of that in the first 3 seasons. Now Don is no longer a philanderer, he's divorced. So the women he sees are not all fellow-philanderers or neurotic young women. <br/><br/>Yes, they smoke like chimneys and drink like fish, but intelligent viewers should be able to take this in stride. It is an accurate portrayal of human behavior in the culture at that time.<br/><br/>Season 4 is all about Don. He is the focal point of every episode. It is good to not have to undergo Betty's tantrums. She is still here and spitting nails and being a horrible mother, but she is evolving too and I didn't hate her so much after the last episode. <br/><br/>Mad Men is a very adult drama but without all the vulgar language we have grown used to from Hollywood. If I had teenagers I'd require them to watch this show. The Boomers love it, of course, it is our lives being rerun 50 years later. I totally relate to Sally Draper, a budding adolescent in 1965, because we are the same age. Kiernan Shipka is splendid in that role as the child Sally.<br/><br/>Mad Men has become 'brilliant' after 4 seasons and all fans of this show look forward to many seasons to come. Mad Men has amazing writing, incredible acting (I loved Moss and Hamm), and perfect depiction of the 60s, but it's not a "page-turner". Mad Men didn't have the property of turning me into an Oliver Twist. When I started watching this series, I was not contemplating what will happen in the next episode, or looking out for more, because the series lacks that suspenseful twist most drama series have, and I do enjoy suspense, so this made the show uninteresting.
Also, most of the storylines were repetitive, with a lacklustre plot. What is Mad Men about anyway? The life of Don Draper? Advertising? Who knows?
Mad Men is a drab TV series with just a few good episodes. I am rewatching Mad Men for the 3rd time and it still never ceases to entertain me with its utter brilliance. The wit, the character dimensions, the layers of meaning- it's so beautiful and creative. Who would have thought that a show about ad men (and women!) could pull off 7 seasons of the most superb television watching. I just got up to the acclaimed episode "the suitcase" and like every other time I viewed it, I cried. I think many people who view this episode will find personal meaning in it. The episode ends with Simon and Garfunkel's "Bleeker Street" which was the cherry on the top. A lot of the closing songs on episodes have this affect. Such a special show, with a FANTASTIC finale. Everyone needs to give it a watch. Mad Men follow the adventure of a group of advertising men on their professional and personal life, for a decade, starting i 1960. Like many I started to watch this show when was available in Netflix. What can I say? I think that this serie has really well built characters, you can almost bound with them, they keep develop along the serie, they change and the interactions that they have with each other, are very realistic. Not only the main characters are well built, but also the secondary ones. Sometimes you can even bound more with them, compared to the primary ones. Some characters that you literally hate in the first season, will then change, with the opinion that you have for them.<br/><br/>The many story lines contained in the serie, are very well equilibrated, everyone has his own space and every character has the time to express properly. Many lines (especially from Don Draper) will remain with me, and I will remember them with much, much pleasure. It is a serie that makes you understand how complicated human nature can be sometimes, Jon Hamm portray a very complicated character, that try to reach happiness and self accomplishment in many different ways, without really achieving it, he makes you understand that there is not bad and good, or right or wrong (even if, he is not a positive person), but there are different levels, different gradients. I think that the most valuable lesson that this show can teach is... never judge a person from his behavior, you never know what is happening backstage in their life.<br/><br/>Giving 10 stars out of ten is not easy at all for me, but for me this serie, is perfect in every sense. The details in decor, clothes, even the historical events mixed very well with the main story. If you like character drama, I think that everyone should watch it, it is a serie that really change perspective on life. I just watched the whole thing start to finish for the second time. I can't believe how much I missed the first time around and how much I loved it all over again. This show is spectacular. Do yourself a favour, to use a famous Aussie quote, and watch this if you haven't already done so. I finished watching the whole series on Netflix last night. Images of it, especially of the final episode keep flashing before my eyes. The image of Don with a beatific smile, meditating in a lotus position with the sun and Pacific Ocean behind him, I hope stays with me for a long time. After watching that episode I was stunned at how well it was done. I read the reviews of the final episode and many of them said just what I thought: as an episode in itself and as a concluding episode to a 7-season series, it was superlative. I've never seen anything like it, the way the lives of the few main characters were brought to closure, and in ways that were appropriate and made total sense, it was just beautiful. This is so for all of them, but especially Don, around whom the series revolved. Don has a lot about him that makes him a tragic figure; in the last episode Don reached a kind of Sartori, which left me as the viewer with a feeling of peace, well-being and hope, presumably what he experienced, too. Other reviewers pointed out that the ending left them with a sense of the characters going on to a new chapter in their lives. I agree, and I will add that they all projected a feeling of hope, that despite all the changes they endured, and obstacles they overcame, in the end, they each wound up being where they should, with the exception, perhaps, of Betty.
The last episode was a small version of the entire series: beautiful, deep, profound, and realistic. Awesome work; kudos to all the folks on all levels who came together to make this fine TV show. Set in the changing world of advertising in the 1960s this series is centred on the employees of one agency as they work to gain new contracts and maintain the ones they have and deal with take-overs and buy-outs. There are many major characters but most important is Don Draper; a man with the magic touch in his business who is far from perfect; he cheats on his wife, drinks rather too much and has a secret that could get him in a lot of trouble if it came to light. We also have Peggy Olsen; a secretary who quickly becomes the only woman on the creative team; office manager Joan Harris; the ambitious Pete Campbell and Roger Sterling, the somewhat amoral partner with an eye for the ladies. The series doesn't only follow the characters at work; we see their home lives; Don's family, particularly his wife Betty and daughter Sally, are as important as his colleagues.<br/><br/>If you are looking for action and expect stuff to happen all the time this might not be for you; but if you want a great character led drama that really captures the feel of the era in which it is set then this might be just what you are looking for. The characters might not be the most likeable but their flaws make them feel real. The ongoing story nicely incorporates the news stories that would affect the national consciousness at the time as well as the changing attitudes to race and sexuality. The cast is superlative; most obviously John Hamm who is great as Don but Elisabeth Moss, Christina Hendricks, Vincent Kartheiser, January Jones and John Slattery whose characters stand out. Kiernan Shipka deserves separate mention as she does a great job as Sally; a role she started when she was about six years old. The series provides plenty of drama but also a good number of laughs and one gory shock involving a lawnmower and a foot! Overall I would definitely recommend this superior series. Boy you're gonna carrying that weight, carry that weight a long time. The lead played brilliantly by Hamm with a fantastic supporting cast. Mad men delivers for those who appreciate rich dialogue and character development. Garb and hairstyles spot on for the period. Reckless behavior and careless keeping of incriminating evidence, I could only envision an ending with a fade away from a prison cell for desertion. Unfortunately some may be steered away by poor reviews. How anyone can rate this series under a five is beyond any sense of fair critique. The end of Don <br/><br/>Mad men producers, Don as a character has died and you can either cut him from the show, or re-capacitate him. Throughout the entire show Don has only rarely, insignificantly gave the slightest hint of a mysterious more complex interior self – a niece from the past says hi and is gone within seconds. Only from these minute glimpses can we sense a more interesting Don, but after season 7 I can hardly live by these crumbs of love and must see Don for what he is 99 % of the time; an aging, lying and shallow advertiser whose one-night stand routine becomes repetitive, sickly, boring. Perhaps it is the show's aim to show the pathology of unsatisfied rich alcoholics? One of the rich elements of the show is its historical backdrop – the fight for civil rights and the first black secretaries at the agency, the first man on the moon and every family is watching it on T.V., the rise of the working woman but the sexist comments she has to endure from her colleagues everyday. Peggy and Joan make up for Don's shallowness by far – but also seem to suffer from the shows indecisiveness whether to display the pathology of sexism or to give a more agentive role to the show's women. If it is striving for the last, it needs to do more. Don's women, the agency's women, are all different and nuanced characters, but all too often just put away as the bitter single or insecure confirmation seeking sidekick. Mad men, give it a bold twist, and do it now! I was a big fan of the Sopranos and gather that Matthew Weiner was a lead writer on that. I feel that some other commentators have missed the subtlety of this show - it hasn't won Golden Globes for Best Drama two years running for no reason. Similarly Jon Hamm deservedly won Best Actor last year for a very detailed and clever layered performance. The show takes some getting into but the time is well spent as the character's layers are peeled more and more as the 2 series go on. Each of the characters has a complex story and none are what they seem. The series also has as a subtext the increasing enfranchisement of Women and is one of the few shows that I have seen that shows how far Women have come since the sixties.<br/><br/>The Cast are uniformly superb and the writing and production values of the highest order. I gather that Matthew Weiner has signed on for two more series and I cannot wait to see where this intelligent show will go next.<br/><br/>Graham Howes I was a bit hesitant to start watching this back in 2007. Everybody was talking about how good it was and I was a bit tired of "the hausse". Then I started watch in 2010, and what can I say. It's a brilliant show, with so many wonderful actors. I can't add so much more to all the rave reviews here, it has all been said ;)<br/><br/>I have watch the entire tv series about seven times and I always discover something new. I'm on season 5 now, and ever since the end of S3 it's been downhill. It was good, really good. But now everything now feels redundant and over the top. Core of it all are endless scandals and a garden variety of inequality that is highlighted against the 21st century, and the snowball keeps rolling and same thing happens over and over again. <br/><br/>Also a notable stain appears in the form of Glen. Terrible actor, even for a child actor, looks creepy as hell (complements his character persona I suppose), and the character does nothing to enhance the show. Instead it's a nasty stain that I would love to see removed.<br/><br/>You can stop after S3, because everything else will just take up your time. I will stop watching after S5. I had to drag myself through as many episodes as i could stomach to give this show a chance. Simply put, this show is terrible. While watching an episode today, giving this garbage its last chance, i couldn't take it anymore... I turned it off 2/3 of the way through the episode and literally threw it in the trash. This show is everything that is wrong with people. It contains the negative mindset, negative attitude, unbelievable ignorance, and just downright stupidity that keeps dragging down society. The only reason anyone likes this show is because they are simple minded, blinders on, haven't had a thought in their head since high school(if they even had a thought then), narrow view pointed, close minded buffoons(have I made my point about being narrow minded?). It's Mr. and Mrs. average that like this show (or anyone who grew up during this time or with a similar mindset/attitude). This show panders to people who THINK they are smart. If you happen to like this show, that's great, go watch it 'till your eyes bleed. I, on the other hand, would like those hours of my life back. A NYC advertising agency mixes business with pleasure (over and over and over and over again) while focusing in and out of main character Don Draper's (Jon Hamm) sexual and psychotic escapades.<br/><br/>If you grew up in the 1960s, you won't find Mad Men different or original. If you worked for an ad agency during that time period, you'll recall that people did not behave unprofessionally. If they did, they would have received a pink slip. That being said, Mad Men started out mildly promising, but quickly turned into a joke.<br/><br/>The problem with Mad Men is: too many writers; writers who don't know how to tell a story; writers who don't want to tell a story; and writers who don't know how to write believable dialogue and action for women and children. In addition, the writers dumb viewers down by teaching them that a series of snippet scenes are acceptable. Well, they're not. <br/><br/>Mad Men is like an awkward comedian telling crappy one-liners. Crappy one-liners become monotonous and stale. And that - unfortunately - is exactly what Mad Men becomes after season one. By Season Six, the scenes and dialogue are way too imbecilic to sit through. But don't let that stop you 1960s neophytes from singing its praises. I sincerely tried to watch this series because of the good buzz from the critics, but finally gave up after watching the first 5-6 episodes. It was very painful and took much willpower to make it that far.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I remember the 50s and 60s very well. Far from being a wonderful time, they were, as the series suggests, full of stupid actions and opinions---smoking, racial prejudice, gender prejudice, etc. But I don't need to be reminded of that.<br/><br/>Beyond that, the plots, such as they are, are dull, slow-moving and predictable. Which leads one to ask, "If I don't like the characters or the premise, and nothing is happening, why am I watching?" <br/><br/>The overall effect of the series is like that of movies where special effects are overused, thinking they will wow watchers to such an extent that they will forget about the lack of plot. Simply having everyone smoke and wear ugly 60s clothing while sitting on ugly 60s furniture and spouting uninformed, narrow viewpoints isn't enough to hold viewer interest. At least not mine. I've been on here before, slamming the continuity mistakes in Summer of My German Soldier, Honky-Tonk Freeway, The Rockford Files, Time After Time and Call to Glory, and having just seen all the previews for Mad Men, I just can't resist . . . The writers were so proud of themselves concerning their perfect continuity, for instance, they wouldn't let the kids have an Etch-A-Sketch because it wasn't introduced until the summer of 1960 and their story is set in March 1960. And then they haul off and fill their offices with typewriters that didn't exist in 1960!! A previous viewer commented on the Selectrics but didn't elaborate. Well, here goes:<br/><br/>As previously written, the IBM Selectric was introduced in 1961 - the FIRST Selectric, that is. It was small and tub-shaped. In the background of the previews, a Selectric is visible - a late-1960s model. But the typewriter Peggy is given on her first day is a Selectric II - and not only a II, but a long-platen, dual-pitch (Pica AND Elite) 88-character element, self-correcting Selectric II - introduced in 1973!! (When I was a freshman in 1973, I remember our typing teacher gushing over the beautiful, brand-new Selectric IIs our school had just received, and she and I agreed that the self-correcting DP Selectric II was the most bad-ass typewriter ever made! Today's any-size, any-font WYSIWYG word-processing has made it obsolete, but in its day the Selectric was a true marvel.)<br/><br/>These S-IIs are scattered throughout the office, some even newer (you can tell by a differing design of the keys, more squarish with smaller letters, some as late as 1980.) And in two scenes, there are even two Selectric IIIs visible (lighted cursor position dial, long-platen, dual-pitch, 96-character element,) and those were introduced in 1982!!<br/><br/>Somebody really went to sleep on this one! The typewriters they SHOULD have used were either the IBM Executive or the Remington Rand.<br/><br/>As for Xerox machines, yes, the first Xerox dry electrostatic copier was brought out in 1959, but copiers were marketed before that. We had one in our high school, in the library, that was made in 1956 and it still worked. They charged us 10 cents a page in 1976. So, Draper is wrong - there were magical machines that could make exact copies in 1960.<br/><br/>Other than that, I really liked the show! It's pretty gritty by today's standards, but it's a darkly accurate window on the near past. For us Boomers, it's a stark reminder of why the Libbers were so P. O.-ed at men all through the 'seventies. And the cars are cool! I think Draper is driving a '59 Pontiac. Man, I'd really like to have that car! And the woman that plays Rachel Menken - wow! Is she HOT!<br/><br/>Enjoy! Good setting for a TV series. Perhaps I should have watched the first three series all the way through. But the first episode seemed to be all about "look how quaint, old-fashioned and sexist everyone's values were in the 1960s! These people even SMOKED CIGARETTES AT WORK!" So I stopped watching, til Rolling Stone proclaimed series four possibly the best TV series, ever. So I gave it a go. <br/><br/>Let's face it, nearly every man would like to be Don Draper. Successful, brilliant, self-made, women swooning over him. Even the self-destructive drinking and constant smoking has an appeal. It says "here I am, I've got it all, but at heart I'm just a bad boy who doesn't care if he throws it all away. I'm here for a good time, not a long time!"<br/><br/>But, after several episodes, I realised, this isn't going anywhere! Just a bunch of clever little stories, with the occasional revelation of Don's dark past to give the series momentum. Am I asking too much? Am I expecting the writers to be so clever that they can actually take this slick, great-looking series somewhere fruitful?<br/><br/>Perhaps I am asking too much. If I want to while away a few hours in a fantasy world full of good-looking people, which is essentially all that TV can give us, maybe I can ask for nothing more than to be entertained. Perhaps it has to be a shallow experience to ever find an audience. Perhaps the show can only ever go around like a merry-go-round, not arriving anywhere, not providing any insight into the human condition, not facilitating any transcendent moments of self-awareness. <br/><br/>Most likely this is so. Then why am I so eagerly awaiting the return of Breaking Bad, which is just as guilty of all the limitations I have listed above? Watching Mad Men is something of an exercise in frustration, as week after week the show's creators seem intent on kneecapping an episode that could have been a brilliant piece of television.<br/><br/>It's unsettling to become engrossed in some masterful storytelling, only to have that magic vanish instantly when one seemingly small detail suddenly slams you in the face to remind you that, hey, it's just another stupid Hollywood TV show. In one episode someone casually mentions that Don Draper occasionally drops his Gs when speaking, which dangerously betrays the rural upbringing he's worked hard to hide from everyone. Yet a few moments later during a flashback to his childhood, we hear his family not only speaking with absolutely perfect New York stage actor diction, they're also speaking lines worthy of highly educated upper crust society. They talk nothing like the rubes on a farm during the Great Depression they're supposed to be.<br/><br/>Irritatingly in-your-face flaws like this pop up in every episode. Don's home movies shot indoors with no movie lights turn out flawless; in reality those of us who grew up surrounded by relatives with home movie cameras know that without movie lights, the film would have turned out pitch black.<br/><br/>Of course what's so frustrating about these errors is how they mar a show that comes so very close to being one of the best shows of all time. The setting and time frame practically beg for dramatic treatment, and if the plots seem a little aimless at times, the characters are always fascinating. The production feels top notch from start to end - each shot is beautifully composed, and the lighting is extraordinary. The production design is superb; they've nailed the look and feel of 1960 perfectly. The acting is almost uniformly outstanding, with the exceptions of Vincent Kartheiser (Pete Campbell) who frequently seems like he's acting in a "Kids In The Hall" sketch, and Robert Morse (Bertram Cooper) who is so compelling and letter perfect on screen that anyone else in the scene with him is totally flattened.<br/><br/>It will be interesting to see whether the second season can build upon the first, while curtailing the flaws that prevented the first season from living up to its promise. This is a piece of history right in your face: Advertising and how it began to shape "everything we are" right at the dawn of...television.<br/><br/>A lot of the references in AD Men are things you (have/had/will) see in media classes/advertising classes and justifiably so. New York was one of the places to be in the late 50's early 60's for advertising and it did change the world thanks to...television and its mass communication.<br/><br/>Here you have focus on one agency and the lives of those who have to constantly think of ideas and slogans to make crap look like shinola and give you a sense of "Happiness" every time you see it. So you'll do what? BUY IT. Men selling to women. Men selling to men -- and the dawn of a new medium that will send the advertising world into the biggest forum of their lives in anything and everything they do: television. Oh, what a wonderful time to be an ad 'man'.<br/><br/>That is - unless you were an ad man during that time. This was not a fun job. (Still isn't). You see the trials for having to be "creative" every single moment, the tolls it took on these men and their families, the back-biting, writer's block, the brown-nosing and the COMPETITION. Oh yes, there's a crap load of competition (Wait until the Mid-west gets into the game!)and everyone's neck is on the line, every minute of everyday.<br/><br/>But what I find most interesting in MAD Men is the "women" in and around Advertising. And since this is the late 50's early 60's, we wont see much of women in the top offices in Advertising for a long, long, long time. Sadly, it still is a rare thing today. Not as many as it should be women owned AD firms or women CD's or AD's! (And the same goes for African Americans, Hispanics and Asians in Advertising Offices/Agenies. Rare still - and this show actually shows you WHY.)<br/><br/>There is an gem of an episode where a woman who heads a department store was highly upset with the boring ideas these men in this ad agency had. She wanted her store to compete and be on the level of "Tiffanys", they wanted to give out "coupons for the housewives". When she voiced her view of how crappy and unimaginative this was, 'Don Draper' of the agency said, "I will not allow a woman to speak to me that way." Take note. Advertising then, advertising...now. That's the beauty of this show.<br/><br/>The smoking and drinking will offend some viewers - and it should, now. Don't pick up your pen and write your disgust to AMC. This is history. That's what they DID. And they are NOT trying to make those who watch think it's something they should do NOW. (If you think so, well, you've fallen into the advertising trap they're warning you about!)<br/><br/>They are showing you it isn't perfect. But that was then. They ate, slept and drank their business - their business was their mistress as well as the mistresses they had themselves. It's all about getting that client, keeping that client and getting more of that client and you're number one as long as you keep spitting out the ideas, the copy - at WHATEVER cost - as long as the agency makes its billings.<br/><br/>And this show is darn good at showing you the price from the bottom of the Advertising slime pool, all the way to the top. I would like to commend the writers and producers of AMC's Mad Men for creating a treasure of a television show. It's been far too long since I've enjoyed a dramatic series so immensely. As each weekly episode unfolds I find myself shamelessly enchanted with and intrigued by the period of the early 1960's. Even though I was born in the summer of 1960, I feel profoundly cheated in not having had the privilege of fully appreciating the golden time that it so obviously was. I say this because Mad Men travels back to a time when people seemed predominantly more polite, well-mannered and innately refined.<br/><br/>As I gaze upon each episode I can't help but be struck by the overwhelming cloak of innocence that so strongly defined the tone of our society during this period. Sure people in the 1960's were often power-hungry and very ambitious, but they seemed much more capable of prioritizing their lives than today's self-absorbed egos can. It is so refreshing to see, that yes, there was a period of time when common courtesy and overt civility was actually expected instead of being the rarity it now often is.<br/><br/>This show also starkly highlights how daily work relationships were not dictated by the vast political correctness agenda that has sadly permeated today's business world. How grand it must have been not to have had the underpinnings of political correctness and affirmative action stifling out bastions of qualified workers on occasion in all arenas of employment. What a pronounced sense of equanimity both men and women must have felt when there were no nebulous definitions of their respective societal roles.<br/><br/>What a privilege it must have been to have experienced first-hand a slice of time when it was all about the family, the town, the community and the country. I thank the Mad Men creators for reminding us that indeed the golden years of the 1950's surely did extend well on into the 1960's. And this show serves to remind us so authentically and elegantly of how there really was a soft-filtered, respectable era that we have today so sadly brushed aside and devolved from. Is there nobody on movie sets today who is in charge of speech patterns and standards?<br/><br/>A friend of mine, in the relatively small Irish Ardmore Film Studios, was usefully employed for years as both a Speech (accents) Coach AND as a 'Time Hawk'. His job there was to watch out for actors using modern phrases and inflections in period movies.<br/><br/>It is a pity he wasn't working on the set of 'Mad Men'which is littered with mistakes which ruin the whole 1960s feel.<br/><br/>Several actors use the 'raising query' way of talking of todays annoying teenagers, making every statement sound like a question: 'We went to the Mall today, to chill-out' is spoken as 'We went to the Mall today? To chill-out?". The Mad Men are not the only culprits as I have heard this way of talking even in BBC period dramas!<br/><br/>Frequent use of the popular phrase: 'You know what?' which precedes the most banal statement, such as: 'You know what? I won't have a drink, thank you'.<br/><br/>Other than that, the script in 'Mad Men' is by far the best I have ever heard on a TV series. The obscure, evasive and pithy way that real people speak is perfectly captured. The long silent spaces and the 'nod is as good as a wink' are used beautifully in this drama which otherwise perfectly captures the era I grew up in. To really see what can be done, to exactly capture a past time, put 'The Key to Reserva' into the Google search box and be prepared to be rendered speechless......<br/><br/>Tim Costello, Dublin. Being at home sick and having nothing to do, I started watching it from the beginning. Did not want to watch anything with violence and crime, so Mad men seemed like a good one. It somewhat kept my interest for 3 seasons. I was noticing a lot of decorations, settings, that did not quite agree with early 1960s, the behaviour of people that was not quite normal in that era (like a woman jogging early morning???. ... bunch of grown up men acting as high-school teenagers with a cigarette in one hand and a drink in an other while being in the office???) I literally was getting sick of seeing so much drinking and smoking, as if they all were compulsive addicts. Peggy's character did not go well with me from the beginning,or it was her performance, not sure, but something just felt fake about it. By the 4th season I was sick of smoking, drinking,screwing around and lack of any new development or performance. I simply stop mid- episode feeling nauseated...NO MORE. I wish Netflix was showing "Hung"... It's amazing how well a glossy surface sells. That's all Mad Men is: gloss. Now gloss is the advertising worlds core, so this show may well be authentic, but it sure isn't deep. All those talking about the depth of the characters leave me baffled.<br/><br/>To me this is a modernized "The Bold and the Beautiful" with better dialogue and costumes, but the same over dramatization of a world I can't bring myself to care about. TBATB was set in the world of fashion - now it's advertising for Mad Men, which is just as profound a setting.<br/><br/>I feel very generous giving it a 4/10 - all the points are for the fine work on the setting. The drama only gets one big snore from the TV couch. I'm surprised by the number of negative reviews here. Sure, the show's been hyped to death by the media on both sides of the Atlantic, and inevitably it doesn't quite live up to the life-changing drama it's so often described at - but that doesn't make it a bad show. Despite numerous assertions to the contrary, performances by the cast are never less than good, and often superb: you have to remember how different the era was, how much more inhibited; and not hold it against the actors when their characters respond with stiff upper-lips or blushes where modern people would be much less inhibited.<br/><br/>Plot wise, it's hardly an intense thriller, and many episodes end seemingly without giving you any major revelations (certainly, compared with the likes of cliffhanger-per-week Lost and Heroes, or even Weiner's previous offering, The Sopranos, there's no big incentive to keep watching next week); but it's more about the holistic development of the characters and their relationships with each other, as time marches on and the up-tight 50s gradually give way to the progressive, liberal 60s. Most of the characters face unique, defining dilemmas which reflect the wider social changes of the era. Perhaps there are a few too many moments where we, a more 'enlightened' audience, are invited to scorn the naive ways of that earlier age, but make no mistake - Mad Men is not looking down its nose at its characters, but portraying them sympathetically, albeit era-specific-warts-and-all.<br/><br/>It's of course impossible to talk about Mad Men without mentioning how it looks - sumptuous; almost every detail is painstakingly recreated (there are a few small goofs, but c'mon, it's TV), which, combined with the top-notch performances, makes it easy to forget you're watching a show scripted and filmed this decade.<br/><br/>I can appreciate the criticism that the episodes individually aren't too fulfilling, but to dismiss the show merely because it doesn't awkwardly manufacture conundrums for the viewer to unravel, is like depriving yourself of food because it won't quench your thirst: better to think of Mad Men as a VERY long feature film, and supplement your enjoyment of it with thrills obtained from some other show. I'm puzzled by the good reviews. I'm also puzzled by the bad reviews that only harp on how unsympathetic the characters are, or how much they drink and smoke. Mad Men is a terrible show, but it isn't because the characters are bad people who drink too much. It's because the writing is awful. I'll attempt to enumerate the ways.<br/><br/>With stunning regularity, major characters are suddenly written off of the show. Paul Kinsey, Sal Romano, Max Ginsberg, Bob Benson, Jim Cutler, the list goes on and on. Of course, it's sometimes okay if characters in a show leave, die, or otherwise get written away. But in Mad Men it always feels like it's for no reason. The character hasn't finished their story line or developed in some way, they are just suddenly gone, often without a good bye, and often in the middle of a plot line. Jim Cutler literally just disappears and is never mentioned again. It seems like sometimes the writers didn't know what to do with a character and just decided to bag it.<br/><br/>And, sadly, it isn't limited to characters - the same thing happens with entire plot lines. A large quantity of story lines go absolutely nowhere, reach unsatisfying conclusions, or are completely forgotten about. Betty's hands, Peggy's child, Glenn joining the army, the random waitress that Don spends half a season looking for, the list goes on and on. It happens so often that you start to distrust the show. On the rare occasion that a plot line is interesting, you spend most of your time worrying that it will be forgotten about. Perhaps the largest culprit in this regard is the supremely uninteresting story of Don's past. The show wastes HUGE amounts of time on this, and it is just bizarre to me. It has nothing to do with anything, doesn't fit the premise of the show, and doesn't seem to inform Don's actions or personality, except in the handful of episodes where they suddenly decide that it's super important. Need Don to do something out of character or that no normal person would do? Easy, just show a three minute flashback to his past. This would be lazy writing even if they did it correctly, but half of the time even after the flashback you still don't understand Don's motivation or reasoning.<br/><br/>Speaking of character development, or lack thereof, after SEVEN seasons most of the characters that have been there from the beginning are still barely developed, and the relationships between many of them are nonexistent. How does Don feel about, say, Ken Cosgrove? I don't know. How do Pete Campbell and Harry Crane get along? I don't know. Near the end of the show, Peggy shares a sentimental moment with Roger Sterling like they've been friends for years, and I caught myself trying to remember if they had ever even had a scene together before. I couldn't think of one. Maybe they did, but it speaks volumes that I can't remember. Part of the problem here is that instead of expanding on the existing characters we know and care about, there is just a constant influx of new ones. Even in the last two episodes we were still introducing new characters and spending more time on them than some of the main ones. It's hard to care about any of these characters because a) they're new, b) there are so many, and c) you know they'll either be forgotten about or remain just as undeveloped as the rest of the existing characters. There are so many characters that in any given episode about half of them don't appear because there wouldn't be enough time to show them all. Even Peggy, who is probably the second most important character, is only in about half of the episodes. It's ridiculous.<br/><br/>Another obstacle to any kind of character or story line development is Don's insistence on constantly leaving Manhattan, where the show is set. About once a season, Don packs up and heads off on some completely pointless sojourn, typically to California. We abandon everything else going on and get to be bored to tears by his aimless wandering and endless encounters with random characters we don't know or care about. This might be the most exhausting part of the show. Just why? The whole second half of the last season is comprised of this nonsense, which makes for a very disappointing ending to a very disappointing show.<br/><br/>On the topic of setting, the show is set in the 1960's. But the setting is entirely irrelevant other than constantly beating us over the head with hamfisted "remember this product/invention we don't use anymore?" and "check out this retro outfit" and "wasn't it racist/sexist back then?" moments. The latter is particularly annoying because they exaggerate it so much. At times, it seems like every male character is a chain-smoking alcoholic that can't say anything asexual or non-condescending to their female coworkers, all so that the audience can smugly sit back and say, "I sure am glad that we advanced beings of the future don't behave like THAT anymore." Please. The show doesn't tackle the subjects of technological or social advancement in any kind of meaningful or thoughtful way.<br/><br/>Finally, there are a number of characters that are annoying and difficult to watch. The primary offender here is Sally, Don's daughter. She is just insufferable. I'm sick of movies and TV shows always writing in the precocious, strong child that is smarter than all of the adults. Kids are stupid and don't know anything. I don't want to watch a 12 year old girl parade around with an attitude while her parents refuse to discipline her. Betty, Don's wife, is almost as infuriating.<br/><br/>In the end, I have no idea how or why I slogged through seven seasons of this garbage. The destination was nowhere and the ride wasn't enjoyable. Save yourself the pain. This TV series may just well be one of the best and most thoughtfully written, acted and produced of all time. The magnificent attention to detail of the era contributes greatly to its affect. Character arcs of Don Draper and Peggy Olson are masterfully portrayed by Jon Hamm and Elisabeth Moss. The rest of the cast beautifully blends into each story line such that it almost feels like watching a docudrama at times. <br/><br/>Early on, the way that Peggy handles her pregnancy by the married cad, Pete Campbell (played brilliantly by Vincent Kartheiser) seems well beyond that time period, and yet, as driven as she is - she will stop at nothing to succeed in her career - so it all makes sense. And yet, the delicacy of her personality is a sharp contrast to the decisions that she makes. Her mentor, Don, becomes her nemesis and later works for her -- an endlessly intriguing plot twist to watch. <br/><br/>It's hard not to feel empathy for the icy Betty Draper -- after all, how is a woman supposed to act with a blatantly philandering husband? It's not like she has no romantic interest in him; in fact, quite the contrary. It is heartbreaking to watch her pine away for her own husband. And yet, during those times, infidelity was not only rampant, it seemed to be accepted - along with all of the other indignities that women suffered during that era.<br/><br/>Of course, it wouldn't be fair not to mention how office manager Joan's strengths become increasingly accentuated. Not only does she have a respected place in the firm - to the point of being included as more than just a stenographer during executive meetings. However, watching her be sent up like a sacrificial lamb to screw a prospective client is not only distasteful, but in many ways makes no sense. However, as stated before, this was how women were ultimately treated then -- like objects who were created for the pleasure and service of men. So, in a way, her stature at the firm is just another way to exploit her talents, as opposed to actually respecting what she brings to the table. <br/><br/>While I am sorry to see the end of this magnificent TV series - it's very interesting to see how the story line plays out as the 1960s unfold - and businesses such as these progress into the future -- discarding the old guard -- or, do they really?<br/><br/>In any event, as Don Draper's demise continues, it is great to see how perhaps the female characters in this series not only struggle to receive their equal due, but may go down in the historical cultural record book as American role models, despite whether or not it was intended. But then, with a brilliant writer, creator and producer such as Matt Weiner (whose credits include The Sopranos) - it's all probably "on purpose." Just watched two hours of the new season, UGH! what happened to the great writing? There were as many minutes of commercials as there were of the show. Do I need to see someone drunk and throwing up? What happened to January Jones, having a baby is one thing but what happened to her? Based on that show, if any awards are given they ought to give up. Can January's husband say anything besides " ask your Mother" or "yes dear"? How did Draper get a Zippo from a guy half his age , lost in Korea and found in Nam? I wore pork-pie hats in those days but not on the top of my head ( would have been laughed out of NYC. No one talked to the Boss like they do on this show, if they did they were gone. If my kid slammed the door in my face, it would have been her face that got slammed.<br/><br/>What happened to the offices, did they shrink the set. I watched all 4 seasons of Mad Men recently, and it is now my new favorite show. I think it's the best show on TV, and I can't wait for the new season to start!!! Every single actor/actress is perfect for the parts they play. In my opinion, the writing is superior to anything I've ever seen on TV. This show is completely unique, and I simply love every single second of it. From interviews I've seen, the actors talk about the fact that they never know what's going to happen next...I really love that! Sometimes I'm really shocked but not in a bad way. Mad Men is by far the best show I've ever seen on TV, and Jon Hamm is my new favorite actor!! I hope they win all of the Emmy's on this Sunday's Emmy Awards show! There is probably nothing I can add that has not already been said passionately and beautifully by fellow contributors who also rate this 9 or 10 out of 10. <br/><br/>I agree whole heartedly with the person who writes that the detractors who 'read' this programme as a smug look at a distant past - are indeed missing the point. In fact, from my own view point, the programme does the reverse. Making me increasingly uncomfortable at times with just how little has changed when you scratch the surfaces. <br/><br/>Like all films and television programmes that venture into either the 'past' or 'a distant galaxy' - the best of them tell us just as much (arguably more) about the contemporary world as the imagined places the narratives are set. <br/><br/>Oddly enough, the more I watch it, the less remote it seems. While the 'surfaces' are different, for example: scruffy clothes of 2011, legislation against sexism / racism in the work place and supposed increased 'choices' for females, the power play does not seem that very different. At least not as different as it first appears. <br/><br/>Subtle characterisations, endlessly watchable and you will want to talk about each episode. So find a mate who loves it as much as you! <br/><br/>Highly recommended. Donald Draper, or Dick Whitman (Perhaps a curious reference to the "self-made man" archetype Richard Whittington of the fifteenth century) is amongst the most perfect and repulsive characters our modern psyche can deal with.<br/><br/>He is a serial philanderer, a tyrant of the workplace, frequently drunk and possessing the sort of attitude towards cigarettes as would see you bodily flung from an office building today. For this reason our higher orders of consciousness discount him as a dinosaur before he has even lifted that first ice-cold scotch to his chiselled face.<br/><br/>Yet he is also a hero, a man of his own making, a man unafraid to take risks or show his true brilliance. He is a man who does not chafe under the sort of restrictions or social mores men feel themselves subject to in our modern era. For this reason he is beautiful.<br/><br/>He is also beautiful I suspect for a number of other reasons. He represents an era of expansion, of confidence and of a world untainted by shades of grey or the critical reactions to our decisions right or wrong. He is a trailblazer, a rebel, a pirate of Madison Avenue.<br/><br/>That we have to look back so far to see things we like about ourselves, as well as dislike, shows you we are not what we once thought we were. Donald Draper's world unknowingly survived in the shadow of the gearing- up of two nuclear superpowers for total annihilation. But it also survived in that postwar halo of assured certainties - America is a force for good, Western industry is the most advanced in the world, democracy and the American way must always prevail. In other words the American dream still had substance, it was a cheque still being made out to cash, something the ordinary man could achieve. <br/><br/>Perhaps the passage of time has convinced us otherwise, perhaps it is the failure of our leaders to finally send that cheque to everyone, but what Mad Men does so -almost sensually- well is to put you in that time and show you when the cracks started to form. We didn't know it then, big changes take many decades to happen, but something was happening to our dream, our tortured dream of centuries of hope.<br/><br/>Some will blame the thrusting capitalism which Don typifies for our stagnation, others will blame the changes made even back then which altered our model of how we look at ourselves. It still can't make it too far from the truth. Mad Men is superbly written, beautifully acted, well scored, rich historically and detailed.<br/><br/>But it's nostalgia, we like it because maybe we see back then we too might have made something out of nothing in that age when anything was up for grabs, and lived the American Dream. We're not that country any more though. It's a tragedy, not just a drama. Just recently started watching this culture hit that many say is now the best show on TV. It focuses on life in the 1960's I wasn't yet born so it's interesting to see the way life is portrayed on this series. "Mad Men" is set in the advertising world with business men and hot and sexy secretaries. In a decade of counter culture, war, and protest this show is one enchanting drama that entertains and it really makes a viewer feel vanity and get a sense that the world of office advertising is dirty, unfair, and cutthroat just like life. Aside from that the series is moved along just fine with the dramas of everyday life like relationships, affairs, and lustful bed hopping.<br/><br/>The two central characters are advertising tycoons Roger Sterling(John Slattery)and Don Draper(Jon Hamm)and both are sharp stylish dressers who have a way with not only office politics that cuts good deals, both have an eye also for the ladies and a taste for the bottle. It's interesting to see in many episodes the sometimes rival between the two as Don was Roger's understudy. Both of them are helped and carried along by two attractive and sexy secretaries played super by the voluptuous Christina Hendricks and the cute Elisabeth Moss. To round out as a wild card is Draper's ex Betty(January Jones)as this lady is just trying to find her way after Don has left.<br/><br/>Overall great time period show that's blended with great acting Hamm serves it up and it's combined with plenty of drama to always keep a viewer interested. As the real ad world is about politics, back room deals and going to bed with attractive secretaries. The fashions and clothes shown captures the 60's well as the actresses on the show like Moss, Jones, and Hendricks provide some tasty eye candy. "Mad Men" is a great culture time period drama that's certainly worth a look at. Mad Men is an amazing series. The look, the cinematography, the direction, the writing, and especially the performances are outstanding. Jon Hamm plays a very flawed, but sympathetic lead character with enough mystery to astonish the viewer. Elisabeth Moss is amazing as the naive, but talented businesswoman, while fiery Christina Hendricks lights up the screen every time she is on. January Jones has also proved to be quite talented and has come into her own after 3 seasons. The writing is sensational and keeps you riveted with every single facial expression, the tension nail biting even though something huge rarely happens. Mad Men is a restrained, subtle period television series with an amazing look into the American life in the 1960's. This series is very good, not excellent, but very good. Excellent would be the "The Wire" and "Six Feet Under" followed by "The West Wing" and "The Sopranoes".<br/><br/>The characters are mostly engaging, well written and multi-dimensional and the subtlety of the writing is terrific. The sets are true to the era.<br/><br/>At times, I confess to 'frissons' as I worked in corporations during that era that are eerily reduxed here. Not advertising per se but other media related. Women were treated as disposable ****bunnies, and were not even in the category of 'human'. Yelled at even for the boss's poor dictation or inept direction. Expected to toe the line demurely when the bosses' wives dropped in on the very rare occasions when they were 'allowed' to visit the big fellah's office at all. Wives never came to the office parties which were virtually the orgies seen here. rivers of booze (and often drugs)were omnipresent and the female staff members often berated publicly for not 'co-operating' in the sexual agendas of their masters.<br/><br/>I find it extraordinary that this era has been captured so well by the writer and the cast. It has captivated me even though I've only caught the one season so far. I look forward to Season 2.<br/><br/>With all the dreck out there, this restores my faith in episodic TV.<br/><br/>8 out of 10. This is one of the most intelligent Shows I have ever seen. It would be comparable to the first season of "Six feet under" which was very good and "Deadwood", which was simply stellar. But this epic story is much deeper and digs into the very complex world of certain individuals in a very honest and very realistic way. This was, and sadly enough still is, the very world of Advertising. A world where thousands of people are hired to sell us crap we don't really need. This very American principle is and always was as shallow, as shallow can be. And naturally it involves greed, dishonesty, backstabbing and gender-bashing at it's finest. And now, in 2008, this house of cards will hopefully collapse. Maybe that is the reason why so many people posting here on IMDb don't like the show: because it is hitting home. I love it.<br/><br/>And for the gents that don't appreciate the main character's "flat acting": you are missing the point. Don Draper is a man like many of us ( maybe I should say: like some of us), he has to succeed in a world of sharks, he is driven and ambitious and intelligent, but yet with a secret past that he tries to suppress and therefore put's on a facade, which is palatable to the untrained eye, but fools most of us. So his performances seem strained. A task well executed and rarely seen nowadays amongst white, north-American actors, which in general cannot hold a candle when compared to Guy Pearce, Christian Bale or Clive Owen. But in a world where Tom Cruise or George Clooney are considered good actors I am not surprised to find "Mad Men" misunderstood. All these reviews about how "unrealistic" this show is miss the point all together. This is a show done in the style of a 60's melodrama. <br/><br/>The exaggerated style, the random slap in the face in the super market, the bizarre relationship between Mrs. Draper and the little boy, a woman who doesn't know she's pregnant suddenly giving birth, a man with a hidden past...these are elements that are very much in line with movies such as Peyton Place, Susan Slade, The Best of Everything and A Summer Place...<br/><br/>I think this is one of the BEST shows on TV right now. Unpredictable, provocative, surreal, and occasionally funny. Not every episode hits the mark, but even a "bad" episode of Mad Men is better than a lot of shows on TV today. Just the unspoken communication that the actors manage to convey to each other is incredible and speaks highly of Mad Men's highly talent actors. Mad Men just keeps getting worse and worse. The writing is unbelievably bad, with dialog so lame that you can't imagine anyone in real life saying it. It's always been over-the-top with male characters constantly (and I mean constantly) lighting cigarettes and throwing back straight shots of scotch and bourbon, from morning in the office to evening at, er, whatever ridiculous location they find themselves at. Characters don't "grow" from season to season; they start over at the beginning of every season, as if the past were just a faint memory. What started out as a fresh, intriguing new show has devolved into hackneyed scripts and withered plots. Don't bother. I also love Mad Men and am totally addicted to the show. Everything just flows from beginning to end in each episode. The casting is perfect and I really feel as though I've stepped back in time with each episode I watched. John Hamm as Don Drapper is wonderful and John Slattery as Roger Sterling is stellar. I did some research after viewing the first episode and both the costumes and sets were spot on. I can see Emmy nominations for Mad Men next year and I can only hope AMC releases a first season DVD with lots of extras. I'd love to see more of how the sets and costumes were decided on as well as extended footage of the end of season cast party that AMC ran following the season finale. All I can say is it's a long wait until next Summer for season two, but way to go AMC for airing an imaginative and completely different show on TV today. I used to love Mad Men! I used to make notes in my calendar to be sure not to miss a single episode of men drinking and driving with beautiful women. I loved the portrayal of the time period, started polishing my shoes more regularly and started keeping a drinks cabinet at home. it was wonderful!<br/><br/>Nowadays it's all different... still I watch the show - at least some times and if people ask me to name a great show I still mention Mad Men. Though I always find myself inserting a caveat - "the early seasons". <br/><br/>There are a couple of reasons why this show was great but isn't anymore. it's still stylish, true to the times and all that. It's just not exciting any more! It seems like the story is going nowhere! There were a few episodes concentrating on Don Drapers double life. That's a really interesting storyline I would love to have more of! Discovering that world would be awesome! The young hungry creative copyrighters and designers was another area of the show that made it exciting! now there is really no young heroes left for me to connect with, they're all just the same! And what about Don Draper's sympathetic features? He's just turned into a pessimistic, uninspired, spoiled, boring, grumpy, ungrateful, cheating a-hole! I mean seriously! I hate him. All I want is to see him get caught cheating, dumped and brought back to reality! The main character of the show has become so painful to watch that I don't care about him anymore. I don't feel sorry for him and his un-classy attitude. It doesn't even seem plausible that he is good at his job anymore.<br/><br/>This is the reason I rather re-watch some Game of Thrones than see the next episode of Mad Men. The only reason I DO watch it is because I'm hoping for something terrible to happen to Don. And to get a quick view of Hendrick's chest. I just finished watching Season One and expected that I would warm-up to some of the characters.. but it never happened.<br/><br/>There isn't a single primary character in the show I'd like to meet in real life. They all are so self-absorbed and valueless.<br/><br/>This might be OK if the plot was exciting but it's not. This is primarily a character driven show.<br/><br/>Contrast this with "The Wire" or "The Sopranos" where the viewer gets to see some likable sides of very bad people. (Tony Soprano or Omar Little). The characters in "Mad Men" are not evil -- they are just pathetically self-serving.<br/><br/>So, you're left with style -- and this the show has in spades. But, for me, that wore off after a couple of episodes.<br/><br/>The first season did touch on a several key social issues (anti-Semitism, feminism, gay rights) but only in passing.<br/><br/>Maybe these issues will be more fully covered in the following seasons or maybe some of the characters will become more likable. I understand that cable series take longer to develop characters and plot lines than do broadcast chows. But how many hours are we expected to watch? I heard about this show, but never got around to watching it. One day, I just decided to download it and see what the buzz was all about. I am one episode away from finishing the first season and all I have to say is..wow! Mad Men is just so damn classy and it knows it. The art direction, costumes, and set design are flawless here, you really get the feeling you are watching something that was made in the 50's. There are little things here and there that make this show feel so damn authentic to the time period it is portraying.<br/><br/>The direction and writing is flawless. I have read comments here that it is boring and it is the same thing every episode. Yes, the themes of chauvinist, lies, unfaithfulness and comforminity are in every episode, but the show is much more than that. I see this show as a depiction of how the life of men being on top is slowly going to cease, which explains the opening title sequence. We also have a mystery about a man of unknown origins, Mr. Don Draper, who's story evolves just at the right pace. This is a show you must sit, watch and let develop.<br/><br/>Every single performance is great and true to the times. Jon Hamm is the walking definition of cool with his performance as Draper. Elizabeth Moss is perfect as a woman who doesn't want to play by the rules of the times and keep that innocence. In my opinion though, it is John Slattery who steals the show. Every scene he is in he steals, if it is a comedic or emotional scene.<br/><br/>I can't say enough about this show, it is so deep and involving. I really don't understand the hate. Mad Men may be beyond the experience of many TV viewers. But that's perhaps exactly what is important about this show. It takes place at a very important juncture in the history of this countryjust before and as the US went on steroids to become the superpower that we have been until recently. Because it takes place in the early 60's viewers would have to be at least 60 to actually have experienced those times. Younger people may not realize that there was that much drinking, smoking and regimentation of male and female roles. To a large extent people interacted the way they are depicted. Psychiatrists were rare, and self-help books and groups were unheard of. People did not use hard drugs unless they were musicians or criminals. Alcohol was the drug of choice and it was considered cool, not destructive. Times change.<br/><br/>The interaction of the home lives of the employees of Sterling-Cooper and their business lives seems particularly rich in conflicts and tensionthe kind real people experienced then and now, though again things have changed some. This even involves some betrayal and international plotting against the ownership interests. But, sadly there is no attempt to secure suitcase nuclear weapons for sale to terrorists. No doubt a major missed opportunity.<br/><br/>So, the "action" on "Mad Men" doubtless seems a bit boring to the 18 to 35 set. This could be because they have been brought up on a steady diet of hyperactivity and gratuitous violence. The bad things that happen to characters on "Mad Men" are every bit as meaningful as if their Camero were totaled in a ball of flames, and they required complete reconstructive surgery in General Hospital. But, as with any historical production it is important to put things into historical perspective. <br/><br/>Perhaps it would be more useful to see the characters in "Mad Men" as the parents and grand parents of today's 18 to 35 year-olds. This perspective may make this show more interesting to a broader audience. I was shocked to read a few of the other comments of Mad Men, most of which bemoan bad acting and hackneyed situations. But, like many great genre shows, Mad Men continues the trend of great television programming by putting fascinating characters in a realm so alien from today's world, that we forget that it is our past.<br/><br/>While many reviewers place the highlight of the show on Don Draper, his escapades in the office and in his personal life, the show is so much more than a linear piece about one man. The cast works in a truly ensemble fashion, each leading entangled lives, never fully spelling out how each character is feeling or thinking, rather leaving up the situation to interpretation. The acting is superb, especially the introspective way that Jon Hamm portrays Don Draper. He speaks very tersely, rarely talking with passion about anything (unless he's pitching an idea), and never about how he feels. All of this reflects a society that is long gone... you can't imagine any of your friends acting and reacting in the same way to such situations, but I can't see any of my friends acting like my grandparents and their friends either.<br/><br/>As with sci-fi and fantasy, it takes a truly immersive view to understand and love the characters and the plot lines that occur. It isn't crazy, it isn't out there, it's every day life on a planet that we'll never know. It doesn't relish, celebrate, or bash the 60's... it doesn't feel like a stereotype... it just matter-of-factly is that decade.<br/><br/>What will be particularly interesting is to see if Mad Men has the staying power past 13 episodes a season and not become wrought with frivolities and "period" centric pop-culture references. The acting was great, I felt like casting did well. However, I don't understand why this show gets such high ratings and so much praise from all sides. Sure, the show starts off with a decent storyline and soon you get interested in at least a couple of the many characters on screen. But as the seasons progress, you start to get annoyed at the constant cheating and lying of these people we're supposed to care about. And more importantly, you start to wonder: where is this all going?
The answer: nowhere. After a certain point I lost interest in the characters because their actions had no real direction and most interactions with other characters were repetitive and dull. Every now and then something unpredictable would happen, but it just wasn't enough for me. I watched until halfway season 5 before I finally called it quits, but I should have stopped sooner.
If you like watching people get up in morning, go to work, treat others terribly, go back home, lie to their spouses & repeat, than you should give it a try. A very good show however mired with unnecessary and boring story lines that eventually lead to nothing and with many missed opportunities to build on stronger characters and stories that would be much more interesting.<br/><br/>I would like to see Trudy Cambell in a much more prominent role, being a joy to watch and one of the two most beautiful women on the show. She deserves screen time much more than plenty of others and with Peter and her father there was plenty of scope.<br/><br/>Roger Stirling is the best actor, has the best role, the best lines, witty and sarcastic – you have to listen carefully because there are double meanings everywhere. He should have a more prominent role as he is a pillar on this show.<br/><br/>Betty's story line is mostly boring and uninteresting, with small frills that die down. A beautiful woman and ex-model, she however hides her true slim figure in buggy clothes and loose robes, unlike most other women on the show. Then, 3-4 seasons in, and in another pointless side plot, she gets made fat, with such ridiculous make up that resembles Peter Sellers dressed up as Mafia boss in one of his comedies. They did the same to Peggy a few seasons before. Is this a cheap comedy we are watching?<br/><br/>Lane Pryce, a senior Accounting professional, partner and Finance Director, commits a rookie error in his fraud involving a very small sum compared to the capital deposits previously made by the partners, to justify the tragedy that ensues. Unnecessary and unbelievable.<br/><br/>Don says farewell to his wife on one episode and then talks to her as if nothing has happened on the next. Maybe they forgot to air a few episodes in between?<br/><br/>Don returns to work under humiliating conditions now reporting to his ex lackeys. How can this happen. He is individually wealthy, well known in the industry, head hunted and with a written offer from rival firm. Most importantly he is a partner with over 10% (Peter Cambell has 10% and Joan has 5%) and it's basic that you cannot cut out a partner from profits and you cannot remove a partner unless you buy them out. Therefore Don's humiliating return working on a side office and reporting to Peggy is completely unbelievable and in the end Cooper reveals "we cannot fire him we have to buy him out", and everyone acts as if they did not already know it. Really?<br/><br/>Don gets infatuated with a few women which are consistently much uglier, and 20 years older, than either Betty or some of his other stunning girlfriends. How is this possible and what purpose does it serve? Maybe to portray that he will nail anything that can fog a mirror? Don't think so.<br/><br/>Ken gets shot in the face with a shotgun from a 2 metre distance, miraculously survives (really?), loses one eye and wears an eye patch but then returns to work and behaves as if nothing has happened, cheerful as ever. The writers even make jokes "keep an eye on him" (his child). Seriously?<br/><br/>Whereas the show has plenty of characters which is great, many are being built up and then dropped abruptly with side plots that lead to nothing. All these boring, cul-de-sac plots could have been replaced with interesting stories involving the more main actors like Trudy, Cooper, Ken and so on. Some examples of lead-to-nothing plots, Don's school teacher girlfriend, Don's brother, Peter's affair with Beth, Peggy's affair with Duck, Ben's mental breakdown, Paul's disappearance and plenty more. I am a very-very picky member of audience. I like reality-related shows, and it should be "make-believe closer to 100%". It is hard for me to do not notice sloppy jobs, as I am a scientist. I would not watch anything with poor performance and poor director's work. Most of series (I am 51 now, I had a quick look at many of them, trust me) did not pass one episode on me; 3-4 series I watched for 1-2 seasons, but they did not survive on me: either stories get too silly, or cheesy, or attention to details is too sloppy. I had only 2 serials which passed the line "good" for me (Sopranos and Mad Men), so I am glad to watch it and to own it. It seems that a very good professional was in control of this production. The team deserves recognition, for sure. Mad Men is a great drama. First of all it shows the events in 60's very realistic. Characters and their details are told amazingly by the writers. The actors are great in their roles. Especially Jon Hamm and January Jones. <br/><br/>Even it's in its fourth season, Mad Men still keeps its quality and i think it always will. It makes you wonder what will happens in the next episode even there's no cliffhangers.<br/><br/>I have to say Mad Men isn't everybody's type if you like HBO dramas that won several awards, maybe you should check it out. <br/><br/>Mad Men won the Drama Series Award in both Golden Globe and Emmy for three years, and i think it deserves it, by looking to its rivals.9/10. I have become a huge fan of this series after first sampling it first run (picking up in the middle of a season), dropping it halfway through an episode and then becoming hooked when I started watching the series from the get go from my on demand cable service.<br/><br/>The irony is that I agree with almost all the negativity you can read about in the one to three star reviews except for the 'boring' comments. Yes, if your idea of good drama are shootouts and cars blowing up in a cloud of propane flame, this series isn't for you. If you prefer the saccharine sentimentality of shows such as 'Greys Anatomy' or the reliably neat wrap ups offered by 'House' then the ambiguities both of plot and character of this show aren't for you.<br/><br/>Let me address the negative comments with my own commentary. The first and most valid comments revolve around this show's politics. Yes, the main characters exist to show how unenlightened they are compared to us. They drink hard liquor during business hours. They patronize non-whites and Jews. They smoke everywhere including the elevator. They are universally Republicans to show that to be modern and hip, you can't be one of 'them'. Yet don't we all view the past through our eyes today? When's the last time you saw a movie such as 'Robin Hood' done in Old English or saw a cowboy with bad teeth? I don't agree with the creator's politics one whit but he has his attitude and I have mine. He has the show. When I have mine, it will be Democrats who are all southern drawling race baiting Jew hating dimwits. That was the 60's too. Strom Thurmond was a Democrat then.<br/><br/>The other complaint also revolves around the adultery, smoking, misogyny and drinking. I have no idea if these traits were universal 50 years ago but they did exist. The universality of these traits in the characters is to show one aspect of life back then in the US. 'I Love Lucy' wasn't supposed to show typical family life a decade before 'Mad Men' any more than 'Man Men' is supposed to show typical office life at the start of the 60's.<br/><br/>Enjoy the show for the look, for the superb writing and for the fact that it's a caricature of life back then. This isn't a doctoral dissertation, people. It's TV. I'm truly amazed at the number of negative comments about this show and the fact that so many people seem to be listening to them! This is a great show, full of vivid and imaginative characters, full of depth and interest. The look of the show is brilliant and the detail so carefully thought through so that you really feel like you are in the 1960s. The story lines are intriguing and never predictable, so you are constantly surprised by whats around the corner.<br/><br/>Season 2 has become more interesting, opening up the story lines to involve more of the characters at Stirling Cooper, so it is starting to get more depth too it than it did perhaps in Season 1.<br/><br/>Don't listen to the naysayers about Mad Men, let them get back to their CSI type genre dramas which provide little challenge to the senses. Watch Mad Men and immerse yourself in some intelligent drama. Sorry to disagree with the last comment, but in my opinion this show is great. I love the clothes, hairstyles, and rampant political incorrectness of that time, complete with smoking and drinking in every scene, and kids playing with plastic bags on their heads. The stories are addictive, and the cast is very strong. We look forward to watching it each week, and really love the marathon broadcasts of the first season. This show is something else....we love it and I highly recommend it to all of those people looking for something more intelligent than "My Name Is Earl" There are so many bad shows out there these days, and this one is refreshing. To the other comment I say, if you don't like the show, then don't watch it. Having seen most of the first season during a marathon, I'm not quite ready to christen this a masterpiece, but it is consistent and clever. Furthermore, it has to be one of the most visually stunning shows ever put on television. The costume design, art direction and cinematography are all first rate, almost to the point of being ill-served by its broadcast. Now that the first season is on DVD, viewers can enjoy it in the best way.<br/><br/>This is definitely going to be one of those shows that slays the critics and finds a small but loyal audience. Even for a cable network, it draws a fairly small crowd. Still, the following it developed during the first season and allowed it to be considered a hit should be commended, and I regret not being a part of it. With the second season about to gear up, all eyes are on this show. <br/><br/>The strength of this show and it's continued energy is the excellent ensemble work, but Jon Hamm and John Slattery are the true stand-outs, and both deserved their Emmy nominations (and, especially in the case of Hamm, hopefully their wins). Hamm's Don Draper is a lead character to rival Tony Soprano or Jack Bauer in his charisma and lived in quality. Later in the first season there is a turn of events that changes our view of Draper, but Hamm carries it ably. Elizabeth Moss, Zoe from THE WEST WING, is almost the other soul of the show, and gives us the eyes of a newcomer to this sometimes harsh world. <br/><br/>Over all though this show is defined by its quick and snappy writing, not afraid to present a world where everyone is smart or at least pretending to be. This show seems to capture the flavor of conversation a half century ago. This shows plan is to go through most of the 1960s, and I look forward to living through it. When I had first heard about Mad Men, I thought it was an interesting concept for a show. The 60s advertising industry. As the show gathered tons of acclaim, for golden globes and such, I decided to start on the first season. In the first few episodes, I was extremely bored. There really was no character development to speak of and nothing ever added up. Why should I care about what happens to Mr. Draper? He is such an unlikeable character and has no depth whatsoever. <br/><br/>All we really get in this show is a bunch of jerks cheating on their wives and smoking, drinking and laughing out loud in an office. I don't care about any of it because I don't know any of the characters. I mean, within the 3rd episode, we are introduced to Don Draper's long lost brother. Why should we care? We don't even know who Don is yet? <br/><br/>I'm ranting now, but the show isn't all bad. The writing is good and the sets are top notch. The intro theme is extremely cool. I usually just watched the beginning animation over and over, because I don't care. It just needs depth. This show about Madison Ave. Advertising executives circa 1960 is stylish, well acted and fairly well written. I've seen the first two episodes now, and I'm enjoying it. It has smarts and a wry humor about it, and I'm looking forward to the next episode. There are moments that feel too forced, or too obvious. The introduction of the in-the-closet Gay executive was too hurried. His mannerisms were vaguely suggestive of his sexuality, and the writers should have left this a running question mark for each viewer to determine for themselves, just as maybe his co-workers might have. It's easy to cherry pick a new show's faults, but the only reason I'm on here writing about it is because it's better than almost any other show on television right now.<br/><br/>FAST FORWARD 2 MONTHS:<br/><br/>I've watched more episodes, and the show is fizzling out. It's trying to be too cute for it's own good. And none of the characters are likable at all. None of 'em. The show is hamstrung by it's own contrived stylishness and attitude. It's not that good a show. I don't really understand whats all the hype around Mad Men and the nearly 9 IMDb rating is quite frankly silly. The acting is good and the choice of actors is good, except Draper which I find to be the least talented of the bunch. I absolutely love January Jones acting although I hate her character Betty. Mad Men is an accurate depicting of the 60's+ era, has abeautiful soundtrack and thats about it. There is nearly no plot. I could summarize the whole 7 seasons in a few lines. On top of that there is poor character development on the already unlikable characters. If you want to watch a show more boring than actual life then Mad Men is it. I mean these people are the creme de la creme of the 60's US era and they are plain dull. A show about Martha Stewarts cat would be more interesting. Mad Men is by far the most sexist show I ever watched. It basically tells female viewers the only way they can achieve anything in life is to be pretty and find the right man. That or luck. And spare me the argument that it is actually depicting the raw conditions of that era because a)after 7 seasons of watching silly housewives and sexy secretaries the viewer is getting brainwashed and b) if the show intended the opposite, then it should have focused on the women's perspective. The lead female characters are Peggy (Drapers protégé) and Drapers girlfriends.. it can't go any lower than that. Most women will find the show offensive especially the 1st season, awkward and difficult to watch. Also the realistic and extremely detailed depiction of events that took place at that time can be a bit confusing and boring if you're not an American, like the episode on Kennedy's assassination. To sum up Mad Men is a mediocre, sexist and overrated show that leaves you with a feeling of sadness and misery. I postulate that the overwhelming premise is a time when we assumed we were enlightened with amazing technology, yet we were a society behaving badly to a large extent. Through the industrial age, the depression, and several wars we had arrived and except for the tendency to be "empty vessels" we were finding our way while enjoying life removed from the farms that just several generations prior was still the norm. In many ways we begin to see the decay that we are still fighting.<br/><br/>This show is not comparable to anything except perhaps the flip side of 60's shows like Bewitched, The Donna Reed Show, and Father Knows Best. What a flip it is too. It's dark! The humor lies in the details such as the occasional irrefutable hilarious quip and the outlandish, but accurate, portrayals of the white collar executive and the support structure he built to be the master of.<br/><br/>What makes it addictive is two pronged for me. First, the costumes and sets remind me of my childhood (born in '59) with such realism. The atmosphere is spot on. Then there's the characters such as Don Draper. He's an enigma that is charismatic in the extreme...Played to perfection by Jon Hamm. He acts badly, but he's conflicted by both his past and his inability to deeply connect with those he is suppose to do so with. Something is amiss and what that is played close to the vest, using flashbacks here and there to expose (?) whatever the underlying cause may be. The other principal actors and actresses add the color with their own lesser twists and turns.<br/><br/>It's great to see a series that isn't a cookie cutter type and when used as reflection of what society was it leaves little wonder why we as a society have so many ills from unaffordable gas to overweight excess in even our youth. We still always wait until things are so bad until we, many times in vain, try to fix it. We all have a conscience and when we fail to heed it is it any wonder how everything falls apart? This is a microcosm of that which happens in a particular time and place. It can, however, be applied liberally to any thing from our own four walls to Wall Street. Compelling and recommended for mature audiences who themselves experienced a fair amount of life. Let me tell you I see very, very few TV shows, but that one caught me from the beginning. Just fascinating.<br/><br/>First you find men who are supposed to be mad but you find them not at all. But slowly you start to see the title is not wrong, they are superficially correct and plane characters. Wait only a bit, mad ambitions, mad subtleties, and the mad kind of live we all have now started perhaps those days in the 50's.<br/><br/>Let me tell you about Don, the main man. He's seemingly totally perfect, tall, polite, intelligent, fierce, seductive. He's got the perfect wife, perfect job, perfect house and life. It's fascinating how you can feel his deep sadness underlying every movement, both confidence, talent and a strange bitterness follows wherever he goes.<br/><br/>Wonderful script, nothing is absolutely, nothing ends perfectly, everything rides open and freely, you get shocking scenes, really impressive ones, as well as sentimentally hypnotizing sometimes.<br/><br/>Characters: Cooper is wonderful, Sterling is just wow, Betts is a new icon of conduct and behavior also of perfect beauty, Joanne is excitingly seductive but so subtle you have to raise a smile. Creatives and account men develop accurate mad stories where gossip, ambition and appearances feel comfortable.<br/><br/>I would recommend it, but not everyone is ready. In Mad Men even the air speaks and that's usually a boring language for the most. Being in advertising, I was, of course, fascinated by the premiere of "Mad Men." It's beautifully shot, written, and acted. It's sort of the dark side of those Rock Hudson/Doris Day movies that were set in an ad agency or "Bewitched" - one can almost imagine Darren Stevens walking into one of the meetings. But, there were a few mistakes:<br/><br/>1) When the new secretary first sees her desk, an IBM Selectric typewriter is shown. However, the Selectric was not introduced until 1961 and the show is set in 1960.<br/><br/>2) When Draper discusses the research document that was stolen, he says that there is no "magical machine that makes copies." That's a joke about Xerox machines. However, the Xerox machine was introduced in 1959 and he would have known about it by 1960.<br/><br/>3) When discussing doing political ads, the candidate is described as a "handsome, Navy hero," which leads one to think they are going to say Kennedy. The joke is, they say Nixon instead. In fact, no one would have referred to Nixon as handsome or as a Navy hero. While he had a decent Navy career (http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/ faq60-8.htm) Nixon was not a Navy hero. He was best known as Vice-President.<br/><br/>4) When Draper brainstorms and comes up with, "It's toasted," he's 40 years too late. That slogan was introduced in 1917 to indicate that the tobacco was sun-dried rather than air-dried. I was surprised that no one mentioned "L.S.M.F.T." That meant, "Lucky Strike Means Fine Tobacco" and had been a famous Lucky Strike slogan for years.<br/><br/>5) The department store that "shared a wall with Tiffany's" was Bonwit Teller - at least on the Fifth Avenue side. It was, in fact, run by a woman - Hortense McQuarrie Odlum. In 1938, she became the first woman to be president of a major department store. But she wasn't running the store in 1960.<br/><br/>Still, a great show! It is as magical as it can be done. you are taken to bed. You can't stop seeing. The details are perfect. I recommend! enjoy! If you are looking for mental action, deep characters(even the secondary ones), you got it. Don't watch it looking for physical action or sudden turnarounds. There are them, but they are systematically built up. The background of the TV series is the disrupted 1960 with the cold war, Vietnam and the civil rights. Does anyone understand that what they are seeing is four terrific portrayals of different versions of Narcissistic Personality Disorder, plus one of the confused opposite thereof? Don, Roger and Pete -- played =so= well by the under-appreciated Vince Kartheiser -- are the sons of (respectively) alcoholic and abandoning, smugly prideful and over- controlling, and barely conscious but achievement-obsessed parents. <br/><br/>Joan is likewise the daughter of an obsessively controlling mother, and Joan =needs= to be in =control=. Peggy is the daughter of working class fools who sabotaged her at every turn, leaving her without a sense of identity, as well as much self-awareness. (Does it take a Scientologist to nail a role like that one? Could be.) <br/><br/>All five are simply trying to live up to the expectations either programmed into them by their crazy-making parents... or struggling to find some "rules to live by" in a world where (only) money talks... and =matters=. (Listen carefully when old Burt speaks.) All five are half- conscious "false selves" trying their best with what limited awareness they have to play a game that is way over their heads. Thus far, Roger has it more figured out than the others, but he's as often caught in his own blind spots as the almost-as-perceptive Joan and Don. <br/><br/>Don and Joan will make up. They =have= to. Because they need need each other's awareness to stay in The Game. As good a "player" (rather than a "piece" like Peggy) as she is, Joan is not going jeopardize her standing as the office manager in a shooting war with New York's most charismatic creative director... unless she forms an alliance with the CD at Peggy's old agency. <br/><br/>Just like the rest of them (save possibly for Pete, who's too immature, rule-bound and self-righteous to understand the realpolitik), the other principles will continue to rescue Don from his alcoholism. Not because they "understand" why he drinks, but because as long as he keeps hitting homers, he's their "franchise player." Between Breaking Bad and Mad Men, AMC has my two favorite TV shows still on the air, and with good reason. Mad Men is a marvelous show, bursting with realism. Most shows today cower away from truly voicing themselves in fear of not being "politically correct;" however, Mad Men expresses the 60s in all their glory and shame. They are not afraid to show that women still are not treated properly and that men would sleep around without regret. The show is bold in its execution, and that is something to respect, whether you agree with its message or not. It's not an easy program to get into, as I found it difficult to say I enjoyed it through the first few episodes. By the end of the first season, you are hooked, and the characters are interesting and charming. It makes you feel very sophisticated, in a way. It's suave and visually stunning. Not to mention some of the most beautiful actresses on TV (January Jones, Christina Hendricks, Alison Brie, you get it). It's hard to say you don't wish you were Donald Draper... Cool television, not often I utter that phrase. Extremely cleverly written, intelligent and in many respects an American period piece, custom drama. The gently unrolling story lines, the flawed, broken and unhappy characters make for an intriguing mix. There is homophobia here, misogyny and it is eye-gratingly awful to behold, it jars with us and reminds us also I think of how far we have come. It is so good to see quality television with high production values doing so well. Nothing psychic or spooky here, just ordinary flawed people behaving in ordinary flawed way. Madmen, ad men who thought they were Gods and ended up falling from Mount Olympus. Mad Men, despite a generation of fast-action, quick-cut entertainment junkies who claim they find it boring, is a huge artistic success as a series with both style and substance. It has inspired a retro fashion trend, interest in cocktails nobody has mixed in decades, and countless intergenerational debates about business and personal ethics.<br/><br/>All while providing a riveting character study of the 1950s mindset. Despite the calendar, the minds of the older characters are firmly in the 1950s, a decade rife with racism, classism, sexism, and homophobia. From Roger Sterling of the silver baby spoon set to secret upstart Don Draper we span the social spectrum of white America at a time when the world is changing. The pulse of the Future Shock of youthquake, race relations dialogue, and the sexual revolution is something Madison Avenue needed to have its finger on, but Sterling, Cooper, some of their staff, and most of their clients have their heads in the sand. The Season 4 scene between Freddie Rumsen and Peggy Olsen discussing women's motives for using cold cream is almost painful to watch to anyone who remembers the women's movement. Later Boomers watch this series grateful to have been born during the 50s instead of having come of age then. Younger viewers are incredulous that the world was so socially fractious and that people ever smoked that much.<br/><br/>The latter might not be such a bad thing.<br/><br/>The writing is sharp with superb dry wit and gallows humor when required; most lines have two or three layers of meaning. The production design is impeccable and the performances are stellar and on the money. The almost sledgehammer depiction of sexism and sexual harassment in the workplace is shocking to those who didn't experience it as is the huge contrast of the comparative emotional restraint shown to clients and the emotional disasters experienced by the characters in their private and privileged lives. Every actor is perfectly cast from the stunningly handsome Jon Hamm as our Man in a Grey Flannel Suit to the coldly beautiful January Jones as his Stepford Wife. That their characters are endlessly argued about speaks well of their performances.<br/><br/>Let younger viewers who want car chases and blood spatter watch the programs that exist for those things while their more curious peers can tune in to find out what they missed about the 1960s and why they should feel happy about that. Mad Men drives that point home well. There has been a lot of hype built up for this show. Or it could be that I watch AMC a bit too much. As much as I awaited the premier of this show, I have to say that I was a bit turned off by the lack of subtlety from the writers. The way the characters' drinking, smoking and sexual promiscuity was executed was done too obviously. This completely took over the entire story line of the first episode, with cheesy little lines like, "Shall we drink before or after the meeting? How about both?". This kind of scene has to be written in such a way as to make the audience believe that they are doing it almost unconsciously. Aside from the tactless scripting, the show's setting and theme has the potential to hopefully propel Mad Men into greater popularity.<br/><br/>CR Something about it ...this is not ordinary TV. In fact it provides a more cinematic experience than many 'cinema' films, with high production values, an emphasis on story line not cheap laughs or thrills, character development, and enigmatic red-herrings: all of which you would expect to find in a film but rarely get. This is simply an artistic work and questions about its political correctness, authenticity or message are redundant. Like all art it transcends such mundane considerations and is as enjoyable as a scrummy complex wine (and similarly addictive). If I have any criticism of it as a work of art I guess it does trade, to some extent, on a nostalgic view - or at least some kind of perceived connection with - both 'Americana' and with the period in which it is set, so in more ways than one: TV for grown-ups. After the cool drive of the first two seasons, Weiner seems to really be winging it in season 3. Only die-hard fetishists of 60's fashion and morays, and slaves to Emmy hype, would find the first three episodes concentration on dreary office politics and Don's stale home life as involving as the intrigue of what came before. Don's run-in with teenage grifters and his involvement with Conrad Hilton in the latest episode suggests Weiner might be coming out of his Emmy complacency, but the series needs to be much more focused to deserve another Emmy next year (then again, maybe now they just hand awards to any show that shows off nice fashions. Too bad). I love how so many say that Mad Men is "over hyped," or "slow" or "boring." Really, it's their own expectation that was incorrect, yet they blame the show.<br/><br/>Mad Men is original, like nothing I've seen before. Hamm is excellent as "Dick Draper" - January Jones and the rest of the cast is fantastic. The elements of of the time - the disregard for child safety, the chauvinism, and of course the rampant chain smoking - so funny to see in this politically correct era we live in. <br/><br/>This show is not for everyone. It's smart – possibly too smart for many. There is a high degree of subtlety that the show assumes the viewer has. Those who don't have that sensibility often dismiss the show as slow or boring. Really, they are simply revealing their unrefined palettes. They may be happier with something like Sex in the City, Lost, or According to Jim. This is the most BORING show I've ever tried to watch. Watching paint dry is more exciting. I guess I'm the kinda guy who likes things to actually happen in a show. Nothing actually happens. It's a show about nothing, like Seinfeld, but Seinfeld was at least funny. This is neither funny, nor interesting. I've wasted hours waiting for something to happen, but nothing ever does...smh. What a waste! *This review also contains mild spoilers for an episode of the X- files*<br/><br/>I wonder how this show is so popular and has such rave reviews. I watched all 7 seasons of the show to see what the hype was all about and, I must say that the Pilot remains the best episode of the entire series. The Pilot had the right amount of drama, characterization and mystery. The show never got any better from there on.<br/><br/>Character development - Where exactly is the character development that everyone talks of? Do any of the characters have any progression at all? In fact, this show should have gone with the adage "People don't change". That works far better as a theme for this show. Let's begin with the main character - Don Draper has the same severely constipated look starting from Season 1 to Season 7 and he remains the same emotionless philandering man he was in the Pilot throughout the series. Also, when a man cheats on his wife with almost every woman he lays his eyes on, it is impossible to care about that man or anyone involved with such a man. Is one supposed to feel disgust for him and sympathy for those around him? Or is it the other way round? Also, there can really be no progression for a character like this because such compulsive need/behavior seems to really have no cure(?) and it stems from deeper issues of abuse faced by him as a child and young adult(?) or lack of resolution for past issues(?). On a superficial level, Draper is a "family man" (as in has a beautiful wife and 2 kids and provides for them - here, I am not discussing his virtue or lack thereof), he is also a very successful and powerful adman (so powerful within the organization that he can go AWOL for weeks and no one cares). But Draper shut himself off emotionally a long time ago. He never heals or tries to heal - maybe because the impressionable age is long gone or maybe because he never wants to open those gates to the world or maybe he is OK with how things are right now. Maybe this show should have explored more themes like this on a meta level. Side note : Draper's compulsive need for sleeping around reminds me of the "The X files" episode "Hungry" where the antagonist has a compulsive need to eat and sucks peoples' brains out to quell his insatiable hunger. Not the same compulsion but then, I did feel like my brains were being sucked out while watching this drab show...<br/><br/>Before I go off on another tangent, his wife Betty remains as miserable and childish as ever (this even after she remarries a fairly stable man very different from Don). Her 8-9 year old daughter (Sally) is far more mature when compared to her. In fact, Sally is my favorite character in the entire series, also the only character to have had any progression or development in the entire series. I am sure it felt that way as she was the only one at an impressionable age on the show. However it was awesome seeing her develop from a child to a wonderful, level-headed young woman. Kiernan Shipka was amazing in this role.<br/><br/>Peggy is interesting to some extent but ultimately, there is nothing much for her to do. Same with Joan and Pete. Megan had a good arc for a bit. Way too much time is spent on Roger Sterling. <br/><br/>Plot development - Ever changing management, office politics, ad campaigns for major players along with important events from the era peppered in - Boring with a capital "B". The show tried to do some socially relevant plots (that are timeless) - feminism, challenges of a working woman, ever-evolving interpretations of love and marriage, pursuit of happiness, loneliness etc. but they were all half-baked plots that never went anywhere. Believe me, I did try and root for Peggy and Joan and even Trudy throughout the series, but their plots never went anywhere beyond the basic. <br/><br/>The biggest problem with this show is it tries to juggle with too much - it has a million characters, a million plot points, a million issues, thereby not doing justice to any character or plot or issue. It superficially glosses over everything and therefore, fails to connect.<br/><br/>People applaud the costumes, sets etc. and I have no complaints about that. Performances from most of the supporting cast was fine, although I cannot say the same about the lead. How Jon Hamm won an Emmy for this role, I will never understand. In the end, all I can say is I'll be glad when it's all over. There's way too many months between seasons, way too few episodes in each season and even the plot is getting tiresome. I enjoyed this series immensely when it first began, perhaps only because it mirrored the life I knew in the 60's. It was fun until the last season or two. I am so ready for it to be over but I'm willing to suffer through 6 or 7 more episodes in 2015 to call it quits forever. I actually didn't even realize I was watching the last episode of the 2014 season until I started looking for when it would be on in June 2014. Ho Hum and good riddance is all I can say. Mad Men is one of the few shows that I can give a 10/10 to, but it's also one that I completely understand its detractors. Mad Men is all in how you watch it, and different people, even avowed fans, are likely to see different things, like it for different reasons. Some people just love the characters, which is easy to do with the brilliantly acted and written main cast. Every character is deep and complex, and no matter who the episode focuses on, it stays deeply engrossing. Other people love the art direction and meticulous accuracy. Still others like the deeper themes and subtext that you have to be careful to catch. It's probably the finest example of a show that you get back what you put in to it. It's not casual TV to play in the background.<br/><br/>Mad Men doesn't you over the head with a message, and therein lies my favorite part about it: it really challenges the viewer. You can argue that there is an essentially feminist message to it, but take into account the period it takes place in - that was a real force of the time.<br/><br/>The way it presents itself, not focusing so much on simple plot advancement, makes it a good deal different from many popular shows. It's boring and kind of useless to speculate about, but it's great to go back and discuss things in hindsight. Plot threads and details from long ago come up all the time.<br/><br/>It's truly remarkable how much you can apply Mad Men to current issues. It shows that no matter how far we've come, we're really pretty much the same deep down. We just compress, hide, compartmentalize it - just like everyone on the show.<br/><br/>Great show, but I think it probably works better when you can marathon it. I enjoyed watching the most recent season week by week, but I think you get more depth when you do it in one go. Mad Men, the show that so many recommended to me, I was hesitant to watch it because of the plot. Now this is not a show that everybody will enjoy, there will be some people who will dislike the seriousness and complicated nature of this. If you're looking for a show with a lot of action or comedy, turn around now because this is not what you're looking for.<br/><br/>Initially I was surprised that I continued to watch, the plot is interesting, but very slow. Somehow I was convinced to watch episode after episode and by the time I got to the second season, I was completely pulled in and couldn't wait to see the next episode. I have watched a lot of television shows and I can tell you for sure that there is no other series like this one. <br/><br/>Adultery, Fraud, and Blackmail. What more could you ask for in a 60's themed show? Mad Men is about love and business, it certainly is a show for sophisticated people. I have only watched this show via DVD and have only seen Season 1 so far as I have not gotten any more seasons yet. After watching Season 1 - all I can to start is Bravo, Bravo. <br/><br/>This is a show which for once assumes it audience is intelligent people. The show makes a lot of plot twists which you have to be intelligent to follow. It draws deeply into it's characters. It uses historic references and even historic advertising campaigns to move along it's plot lines.<br/><br/>It is about the Madison Avenue Advertising Execs but it starts out season 1 in 1960 during the historic Nixon-Kennedy campaign and paints over the history with a wide brush. The concept of this series is very high class and has much polish. When I get into the seasons after number 1, I hope to find the quality the first season has.<br/><br/>There are some lines which get a little soapy in the main characters but it is interesting how the characters seem to get into the real history. Towards the end of season 1 the series starts to go into some of the characters besides the main lead.<br/><br/>One veteran actor who impresses me in season 1 though his role is just starting to expand late that season is Robert Morse. His role is a far cry from the roles he had in the 1960's but his maturity as an actor shows through with much shine. <br/><br/>Everyone in the main cast seems to get their chance so far as the writing in season 1 is outstanding. "Mad Men" holds up a mirror to the American drive for success and perfection and shows the terrible cost those goals exact on relationships. Although set in the much more sexually- and racially-stratified 60s, the characters' constant failures and inabilities to connect with one another ring true in today's still-shallow society. For the characters of "Mad Men," shallowness is not only a way of life, it becomes its own virtue. For example, in the most recent episode, Roger Sterling is humiliated by the firm's biggest client by being forced to play Santa at the Christmas party, definitely against the dapper Roger's character, and despite Roger's repeated declinations. The client insists and gleefully mocks Roger, forcing all the office staff, men and women, to sit on Roger-as-Santa's lap while he takes pictures in a subtle form of emasculation. This power play is particularly disturbing to watch considering the Christmas setting, a time which typically brings out sentimental and often spiritual themes in TV shows. But the best that can be hoped for in the world of "Mad Men" is to rise aboveâ€”which Roger does. He makes the most of his situation and brushes off the humiliation without a hint of sentiment, enacting the image of "goodwill towards men" by handing out presents without any of the spirit behind it. For shows of less complexity, this kind of thematic coldness would be off-putting, but God or any other form of higher purpose is so absent from the characters and their lives it's almost as if, like the numerous bad and absent fathers depicted on the show, he has abandoned them to their own devices and they are left, helplessly flailing for shreds of meaning and connection that never come in a superficial world they themselves have the job to continually create. Series two of Mad Men, which I finished watching last night, revealed a depth and complexity that I have rarely seen on television. Critics are often bemoaning the passing of a golden era of television drama, but nothing has equalled this show. After, reading the Guardian blog, which is populated by adoring fans, pawing over every line of its exquisite writing, it has proved to be something of a shock to read the many negative comments on IMDb. However, I am becoming resigned to the fact that there is a strong correlation between quality and rejection on this board. Many of my favourite television experiences have captured the attention of the television public in a big way ( although The Phil Silvers Show was massive in its day ) I started watching Mad Men last year, after I saw a blip about it on "On Demand". Well, I was really thrilled to find a TV show that wasn't like "CSI, Elevator Inspectors Unit", House, Cops, cops, and MORE cops!, Lipstick Gossip Mafia, etc. It's a show that takes you back in time, taps into the psyche of the people leaving the repressed 50's and going into the progressive 60's with a new outlook on life, the world, and themselves.<br/><br/>It's a story about a man (John Hamm)who can't stop himself from being a playboy and cheating on his wife at every turn, yet is insanely jealous if another man complements her (and she's GORGEOUS, played by January Jones).<br/><br/>It's about the misogynistic Madison Ave. men, and how they are forced to re-evaluate the way they treat women, each other, and their families.<br/><br/>It's a window into pop culture from behind the closed doors of the "boys club", and how they survive in the cut-throat game of advertising.<br/><br/>But don't take MY word for it, have a go and watch. Easily the most brilliant casting in the history of television was casting "pierpoint fitch' as the Chairman of this agency. true genius. The show is a pleasure, everything is right and tone is also right. Little things like the right mics are in the recording studios (no ever gets that right) It's the right version of the Selectrics.<br/><br/>I take it that his secretary is going to go on to be Mary Wells? And how come not one wife said....wait a minute they do their work in air conditioned offices, why can't we buy an air conditioner? wow.<br/><br/>Interestingly each media company selling ads in NYC had some of "these guys" around until almost 1980, you needed them to talk to the other guys like them at the ad agencies. And who all knew who they were--old dru ks who screwed around on their wives. Now, if they exist, it is well hidden not celebrated. Walter Truly a classic. This series compares to nothing out there. It's simply the best. The only other series that come close to this artistry are maybe West Wing and Lost. Matthew Weiner's AMC classic drips of pinpoint precision, accountability and detail into the life and journey of an advertising agency on Madison Avenue during the 1960s.<br/><br/>Mad Men is one of the most intimate shows I have seen in my lifetime. I can start from anywhere, preferably with protagonist Donald Draper (Jon Hamm) playing an Advertising Executive who is just a cut above the rest, bred from a different cloth. The whole show is one big, lingering arch portraying the quarrelsome duality and struggle of who Don is to himself and others. Certainly one of the finest characters ever written and put to life on screen, the complexity of his personality being slowly scrutinised and dissected across the seven seasons is one of my finest television experiences in a while.<br/><br/>The show does a splendid job displaying the set, attitudes, culture and fashion of the 1960s. Everything from what cereal boxes, bedding quilts, ties and hairstyles are used aims to carefully connect us with a time period a lot of us don't seem to be familiar with.<br/><br/>Every single scene is worth the viewing across the seven seasons, but beware this is NOT an easy watch. It is a character-driven storyline, being that the seasons progress with how characters behave and adapt with different scenarios over time. There is no bold, linear plot to this show.<br/><br/>Having said that, just enjoy because after watching it through the first time, there will be nothing like it and wish you could rewind the whole experience. This is a show that gets the 60's right...I watched the JFK funeral on our Black and White as a young child so I'm not far removed from the era. If you're not from the era; it's difficult to see the nuances...Don Draper is the prototype Ad man from that era...I worked for a printing company in Philadelphia ( Chilton) in the 70's...We would run ads back and forth to Madison Ave a couple times a day 7 days a week...Manhattan was very different then...This show is excellent at capturing the aura of these mid century movers and shakers...A brilliant show and deserving of it's rating... 50ies era super personified. This series will literally make you travel in that golden era. That's how the legend of Don Draper was built Damn I really loved this show, why why why did they only do 7 seasons smh. I did not like how it ended though. I think that despite the hair shielding some of his face, the hitchhiker is a dead ringer (pun intended) for Don. It has been said that the series began with a lie and it will end in lie. Something will happen to end Don's life and this hitchhiker will take over his identity. I really enjoyed watching this show. It had some things I didn't really like about the characters at times and sometimes that I thought might be a little out of character but overall I thought it was pretty awesome. I love the 60s and I get into all the pop culture, music, style, etc. of it and just enjoyed this show a lot. It's very nice to see how the series shows a correct view of the mindset of people living in the 60's. Only on season 2, def holds my interest, it is so weird to see this time of the 1950, 60's where women are treated so poorly and everyone hops into bed with each other, and the men cheating on their wives like it is no big deal, wow. I have heard about mad men for years, but I was never interested in it, till a few months back I was bored and I wanted to watch anything with slow pace just to kill time, so I've watched the pilot and surprisingly I was hooked from the very first begining!
The charcters, the era, the habits, the advertising, the dreams, the betrayls everything was perfctly executed, but my favorite part of it was that this is one of the only few dramas that will never explain to you what the concerned person is feeling right now! you don't see them go to therapy on every episode and you don't see girls sitting around and chat for 15 minutes about what their husbands did to them just for the sake of the audience of the show would understand whats going on! in here you get to be in their shoes and analyzed what they are feeling or thinking right this moment, and these scenes with these little details were moving and realistic (if you paid enough attention), I can not deny the fact that it is a slow pace series, but it was never boring.
And I don't wanna spoil it, but the finale was everything they have build up the show to be end up with, they don't give you false promises and they don't get you excited about things will never happened, on the contrary they just give you what you already know as a fact how things will wrap up. I watched Mad Men in 2017 and got so totally engaged and overwhelmed by this fantastic tour the force of 1960s that I watched all the 7 season during a period of little more than a month. Meaning that most of my free time was spent with Mad Men, and I don't regret anything, just perfectly chosen priority of my time!<br/><br/><ul><li>For those of you with a business interest, the development of the ad agencies including real client and campaign cases is of real historical insights and value.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The replication of the 1960s is made with impeccable attention to details. This includes fashion, clothes, interiors, behaviour, attitudes and values. You just want to be there yourself.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The development of characters and the intrigue is varied and quite complex on several layers, meaning that you will never be bored once you get hooked into the show. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>For those of us in the age that has lived during the sixties (including undersigned) it is also a quite nostalgic and emotional journey (of course idealised) into a time period when life was possibly a little less complex and good faith in the positive development of society and the world was intensely present and encapsulating. </li></ul><br/><br/>Otherwise all has already been said about this masterpiece in the reviews below. Put Mad Men on top of your watchlist if you haven't seen it yet. It is definitely on my top five list of all TV series of all time! This is my favorite series of all time. I've watched it several times. The character development is gold, great scenery, costumes, I enjoy the office dynamic. It's funny, entertaining, complex, and gripping.<br/><br/>A lot of reviews are down on it because they're comparing it to the sopranos.. why? It's not the same show. I don't think one series sucks because it's not the same as a different one even though they share some of the same production staff. I've never seen the sopranos and when I watch it I have no intention of basing my opinion on much or little it's like mad men. Seems pointless to me.<br/><br/>Anyway like all things in life, this is my opinion and not everyone will like the same things, but I would say give mad men the first season and if you hate it, you will probably hate the rest. Nothing is universally liked but this is for me the best that TV offers. In this world, there are a set amount of truly original things, especially in television. There are very few TV dramas that are/were truly original for their time. Probably under ten. And make no mistake, "Mad Men" is one of them.<br/><br/>"Mad Men" has no central plot, looking back. The beginning doesn't neatly tie in with the ending. The ending isn't even really a proper ending because that's not how real life works. It was the first non- soap opera TV drama to take what is sort of a non-premise and turn it into upwards of 50 hours of television.<br/><br/>The other thing about Mad Men's premise is that, well, simply put, it's awful. The premise is pretty much this: "Don Draper, husband and father of two, with a mysterious past, works at an advertising agency." Or, if you consider Peggy the main character: "Peggy Olson, a young woman with talents she doesn't know she has, becomes a secretary at an advertising agency."<br/><br/>And that's the EXCITING way to put it. The premise for "Mad Men" is without a doubt one of the most boring premises in television drama history. Which is why it's INCREDIBLE the way the writers, actors, and directors turn it into ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING SHOWS EVER.<br/><br/>That's not all, either. The show is without a doubt the most realistic show to ever hit the small screen. Even other brilliant dramas (Breaking Bad, Sherlock, The Sopranos) have significant problems when it comes to how they portray what the characters would really do and how real life works. To use my examples as examples: Breaking Bad is more dramatic than real life (even for a drug dealer), Sherlock has a somewhat uneven cast of characters, and The Sopranos has an even MORE uneven cast of characters.<br/><br/>But Mad Men is different. When you watch Mad Men, or at least when I do, I feel like I am watching something that really happened, more so than any other television show I've seen (and I've seen a hell of a lot). Time skips around. In comedies, where each season is a year, important things seem to always happen once a year (finales). This even happens a lot in dramas. Since "Mad Men" wants to have good season finales, they fix the other thing: they play around with time however they damn well please and it's all the more brilliant for it.<br/><br/>The other thing that truly makes this show so fantastic is the characters. Mad Men is, without a doubt, a character study on its entire cast, and it has characters so vivid and well-rounded they could almost be in The Office (which has, by the way, the best cast of characters of any show, ever), which is an extremely high complement. To only name a few, there's mysterious Don Draper, tragic Salvatore Romano, fierce Betty Draper, two-faced Lane Pryce, hilarious Roger Sterling, enigmatic Bertram Cooper, and, possibly the best TV character of all time, Joan Holloway. I could go on for a review about each of them, but I won't.<br/><br/>The acting is, needless to say, brilliant. The MVP is, of course, Jon Hamm, but he has real competition from January Jones, Elizabeth Moss, John Slattery, and Christina Hendricks.<br/><br/>The show is 15% dialogue and 80% subtext (the remaining 5% is all the sex scenes), which is what makes it brilliant (a word I'm probably using too much in this review). Never before have I seen so much in a television show go unsaid (not since "Fish Out of Water," anyway). <br/><br/>The show is without a doubt the most artistic thing to ever hit the small screen. Weiner says it was rewarding to create it. The other writers say it was rewarding to write it. The directors say it was rewarding to direct it. The cast say it was rewarding just to be in it.<br/><br/>I can tell you, with absolute confidence, that just WATCHING this show was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. I have rarely reflected more deeply, been more inspired, cried or laughed harder, or been more captivated than I was watching this show.<br/><br/>All that being said, I don't recommend this show to everyone I know. And the reason for that is because not everyone will like it very much. It's artsy. It's slow. It's borderline pretentious. Very few people die, and when they do, there are no explosions behind them or sick burns issued by the badass killer. It isn't the most exciting show on television, not even close. It's at times tiring just to watch it, looking through all the layers of character trying to analyse on just a very basic level.<br/><br/>But what it lacks in all that it more than makes up for in everything I've said above. It is entertaining, it is thought- provoking, it is intelligent, it is artful, it is correctly paced, and it makes absolutely no effort to please the fans, because they know that if they don't try to please us by giving us everything we want, we'll be pleased even more.<br/><br/>If you want explosions and badass dialogue, watch "Breaking Bad," which is equally incredible, but in an opposite way. Stay away from this show. <br/><br/>But if you want everything else I said in this review, no show does it as well as this one, and the only time you'll be unsatisfied is when you finish the show and realize that nothing will ever be quite like "Mad Men." For those people, I cannot possibly recommend this show more and I cannot recommend any show more than this one. Hands down this is easily one of the best shows ever made. They have thought of ever detail. The stories are fantastic, the writing is fantastic, the characters are fantastic, the sets are fantastic, each character is so human, flawed, yet lovable - and that's fantastic too. <br/><br/>Everything about it is believable. A bonus for me personally was that Sally was "born" very close to the same time my own mother was. It was fun for me to watch the historical events that they included in the story lines, and see the way that humans and culture reacted to them. <br/><br/>The first time I watched through this show, I kept asking myself: "why do I keep pressing play?" The story lines are subtle enough that I wouldn't say there are cliff hangers at the end of each episode, but you do care and want to know what comes next.<br/><br/>Just excellent. Possibly my favorite show of all time. I haven't finished watching all of the seasons but i am now in season 6. I just love everything about this show. All characters in this TV series are well played and in my opinion well chosen for each role. <br/><br/>What i enjoy the most is the time set in Mad Men being in the 1960s and how everything has involved in advertisement since then. The suits,the drinking in and out of the offices they work and especially the cars they drive, there is nothing not to like! <br/><br/>Famous people are also mentioned who were very important in that period, which is kind of cool! It refreshes your memory of what happened at the time and how this influenced the American population then. <br/><br/>The script is amazing how there are different role leaders in the series but mostly how the life of the protagonist moves on after mistakes he made in his life.<br/><br/>Mad Men is a must see TV show. I rated it 9 maybe because i haven't seen the ending yet. Which i bet i will not be disappointed. Mad Men Mad Men: Emotions into investment<br/><br/>Mad Men: Turning weakness into money Mad Men: Alcoholism at its finest Mad Men: Being a man Mad Men: You'll know it when you see it Mad Men:I have watched Mad Men develop, from an uneasy start, it was new, foreign to the senses. The stimulants changed, I was no longer being over-whelmed by the critical and blatant messages that are usually projected from Pop Culture, it was confusion I felt watching the first two seasons. Finally I understood coming out of the haze a lot like the awareness you gain after driving multiple times compared to the first, I was being introduced into a new action drama of subtlety. From the outside it might just look like a show dedicated to smoking addiction, cheating, and alcoholism but like the basis for the plot line which is ads it draws you in. This T.V series can be described as being about so many things that even Don Draper would be tongue tied. What this story hooks you on is the conflict of feelings, of problems that can be related through time, it is about the struggle of the common human experience as portrayed in the time period of the stormy 60's. Through a core set of actors and actresses and the unending charm of Don Draper (Jon Hamm) a Bond esque figure who the story arc is centralized around the show coerces you into watching the in and out struggles, and ambitions of these Ad Men. The climax of action is only about as much alcohol the characters can consume yet I find my self with adrenaline at points because I invest time of my life into this show, every high rise, pitfall, rude comment and clever remark isn't just directed between the characters, its thrown out at me. This t.v series directed by Jon Hamm is unlike any show iv'e ever watched and the complexity and charm will see me through any further seasons to come out. After watching this show i questioned the existence of human life. Never ever have i seen anything this uninteresting in my intire life. I want to wish the producers of this series to change carrier and start working at McDonalds. Further more, i hope the actors are beeing payed a lot for doing such a boring series. Wow, they must be really needing a jobb to do this show. It's a slow-paced, but it's worth it. Just keep watching cause it's great! Capitalism, with its marketing, is able to sell you on an idea. It sells you on the belief that you, as an individual, have value and agency, and that your efforts determine your trajectory and ultimate outcome. It acknowledges the existence of the ego while feeding into the urges of the id. It tells you that your failures are the fault of you as an individual, not the system, and in doing so, attempts to facilitate self-improvement (e.g., self-actualization & self-improvement culture).<br/><br/>Capitalism is the commercial of equal potentiality-the idea that everyone starts out as a "tabula rasa," and that with enough work, any and all outcomes are possible.<br/><br/>While capitalism sells you on the idea that hard work and agency are the sole arbiters of outcomes, Don Draper's success is, in large part, a function of chance and circumstance. It was chance and circumstance that gave him an opportunity to exit the war, and it was the same condition that provided him an opportunity to become a Mad man.<br/><br/>Don Draper is the paradigm of capitalism, and while he is the embodiment of its successes, he is not the product of its commercial. Cocktails and fancy cars, glamour and sharp suits, madison men, or as they prefer to be called "Mad men". A fine work of art about the men in the advertising business, and the women too!<br/><br/>The thing about "Mad men" is that when you look at it as a TV show, it's great, but unlike other shows, it's only when you go from watching with regular sight to admiring and involving all your senses, it's only then all the magic happens, it tastes like fine wine, smells like expensive cologne, sounds like your favorite band's live concert and feels like no other tv show would make you feel ever.<br/><br/>Mad men is the most elegant show ever, period.<br/><br/>10/10 All characters seem so realistic and well etched out. They are strong and yet fragile. They have great strength and yet very flawed. Besides overdose of cigarettes and whiskey in almost every episode, this show rocks!! My favorite episode is - The Suitcase. Enjoy the 60s magic in the Madison street! Absolutely Love shows from this Era!!! I wish there were more like this!!! I hated to see the series End!!! BEST SHOW EVER MADE !!!! This was the best decision I made so far while in quarantine. I will miss watching it everyday. Everything is amazing: the writing, the scenario, the clothes they wear, THE MUSIC! I loved every second of it. My new favorite series. Well written, beautiful! This show got me so badly, it'd been a while I haven't watched a good show. Mad Men is a must see TV series. It has great scripting, interesting characters and some top notch acting. The leads are excellent especially Elizabeth Moss as Peggy Olsen whose evolution as both actor and character is tremendous. Peggy is one of the most realistic characters in any series as is Vincent Karthesier's Pete Campbell. There's someone like Pete in every office, annoyiing and entitled, but vital to the operation no matter how unlikeable he is. Pete is a great foil to the high flyers and uber-confidents leaders and is one of the reason the show works so.
The way the 60s is portrayed is amazing and very accurate from what I'm told and certainly come across as very realistic. As for advertising, I don't really get it, but hopefully I've learned a little. Stylish, historical, accurate, rich and beautiful... very beautiful!
This is the perfect show, I can't figure how to make a better portray of those years with a straight story that keeps you hooked (without tricks!) till the 100th episode.
I honestly don't understand how can you rate it below 9. Yes we are talking about career men in the 60, so lot of smoke, business, alcohol, sexism... maybe not the best for female audience, but that was that world at that time, and this is how accurate it is. Just watch the first 3 minutes (you'll find the into also on youtube) and see for yourself. We loved this! It's very entertaining, strange, funny and crazy in a way. A convincing portrait of the 60s and must see for anyone. This show ties with the Sopranos for the best ever. I chose those two adjectives for the title because that's what this show transmitted me. Not only visually, but also it's content.<br/><br/>The greatness of this script makes you feel trapped on the screen for more than 90 episodes with no need of physical violence, shooting, explosions or anything alike.<br/><br/>The development of each caracter character is so deep that makes you feel like they are real people, people you know, with real feelings and real history.<br/><br/>Each word of every dialogue is carefully chosen. The whole 60's atmosphere immerses you deeply in that era.<br/><br/>In a few words, this is a very human, emotional and beautiful show to watch and enjoy. Why do they keep casting Weiners homely kid who can't act? Forget it already. This is truly one of the best drama series in the history of television as it has everything a drama should have: great characters and ensemble cast, superb writing, mind blowing sets and costumes. It's a character driven story that follows Don Draper and the people around him for ten years from 1960 to 1970 and the writing in these 7 seasons have been interesting and enjoyable to follow. Matthew Veiner created a piece of art with his unique and spectacular writing, mixing fiction with non fiction made him get freedom and with that he could create the many characters that the show has to offer and they are all realistic and believable characters, it's some of the best characters in a show that I've seen.<br/><br/>How Matthew Veiner and his crew have recreated New York in its 60's have been something incredible to see as it's detailed from the clothes that the people wear to how they act and the whole world has a feeling that is hard to capture but the crew behind Mad Men succeeded.
So what are you in for if you choose to watch this piece of art, more than one of the best drama's in TV history you get to see the fine acting of the whole ensemble cast and mostly Jon Hamm, the man that plays Don Draper, everyone did incredible and emmy worthy performances. I don't have enough words to say about this show. I can just say that this changed my view about life and made me think more and more.
This show isn't for the people who don't like drama or want suspense and action.
This one for the people who really enjoy watching some people just talking and think about what they say.
Please.. Don't watch this show if you're not one of these.. and if you're one, you're about to have a great pleasure. **DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU HAVE WATCHED THE FINAL EPISODE OF THE SERIES** I have watched the final episode of the series today. Mad men is a great series, you will certainly get attached to the characters. I had made a review of the final episode "person to person", when I finished watching it at first I felt disappointed because I thought it was a dud, a letdown; I was thinking to myself "a wonderful series should not end so vaguely", but then after some reflection, online reading, watching interviews with Jon Hamm and also the trivia on IMDb, I realized that the ending was very good and inline with the rest of the series. Also when the series started, I didn't get why Elisabeth Moss (Peggy) was the 2nd from the top on the credits just after Jon Hamm, but as it went along, I realized that indeed she is the star, the chemistry between Don and Peggy although not sexual, is a big part of what drives the series and "the suitcase" episode is arguably the best of the series. There were a few discontinuities in the story line. Although it is not as tight as for example "breaking bad" it is still one of my favorite series ever. The character of Betty was not very likable and ended sadly. Peter's development over the years was nice. His redemption was the goodness of his wife Trudy. I will miss Don, I will miss Peggy and I will certainly miss Roger and his humor and joie de vivre. Jon Hamm is as appealing in this as he is appalling. You may feel stronger with one of those than the other, but while he is the number one character in this, there is a lot more going on here, than might meet the eye. Especially at first, you may not be able to see it. The women are as much part of the whole show as the (Mad) Men. You could even argue that they have a lot more going on at times.<br/><br/>The show itself is slow paced though, which may not go down well with some viewers. You really have to be in the mood for the show, for the setting, the time line and all that surrounds it. I know that Jon was hated as much as he was loved by viewers. Because he had so many flaws, but was also intriguing and had that extra special charisma going for him. It's almost impossible to not be enamored by him.<br/><br/>Some lingo may not work or may be confusing too, but in the context, you'll never lose sight of things. You don't have to be in the advertising or management business or having lived ages ago. This does work as a bit of a history lesson. And the acting is superb. Of course as with many (recent) shows, it makes sense to have watched all the seasons from the start ... it's character building, even if nuanced We watched all 7 years of this series within the past couple of weeks (and that includes a couple days with no power after Hurricane Irma). I thoroughly enjoyed it in all aspects- it was very well cast, there was great character and plot development. I enjoyed seeing the changing of styles and the music was also current for the time periods. I was not really aware of Jon Hamm before, but now consider myself a fan of his; he did a really good job as Don Draper. The only negative I have to say is that the end was kind of anti-climactic and not really believable to me. In summary, I am sad that I have finished this 7 year series. "Mad Men" is, without a doubt, the greatest television show that has been made in my lifetime. Jon Hamm does an extraordinary job as Don Draper, as does the entire leading cast, particularly Elisabeth Moss as Peggy Olson. The writing is well done, and the set design is consistently gorgeous. <br/><br/>I have essentially nothing to say about this superb series that hasn't already been said by others on here. It's great.<br/><br/>(I have seen this several times, most recently in February 2017.) It took me two or three attempts to get into the show. Being a slow paced drama means you will need some time to get familiar with the characters and to get invested in the story/ies. Once you get in the mood you are in for a treat. It is absolutely captivating, charming, witty and sophisticated. It love how they managed to engage me for full 7 seasons and how I had a unique love/hate relationship with several characters on the show. This made it more realistic because they always felt like real familiar people you meet at work (with a few exceptions). Don't waste time, this show is one of the best and it radiates quality and beauty in every episode.<br/><br/>Have fun!! I binge wathed the whole series again. To my mind, this is the best show I've ever seen on TV. On a surface level, the performances are even more modulated and complex than I remembered. Originally, I thought January Jones' part was weak, but watching her performance a second time, it caught my heart up in a way that was so unexpected. She's a beautiful, smart woman stuck in a time and place that just crushes her as a human being. Her irritability, her passive, yet angry personna, her depression, her dropping out of life, all of these qualities are reminiscent of my mother's life. It's a difficult, yet mesmerizing performance to watch, only because you know there's nothing you can do to save her.<br/><br/>Another commenter wrote that the show is all about the subtext. I agree. The paused conversations, often delivered in a flat, unemotional tone, only give the viewer deeper access to what is "really" going on. The device of using an ad agency, where people's hopes and dreams are compacted into 60 second commercials, is the arcing metaphor for what life is capable of giving us, yet of how little we actually ask of it. <br/><br/>All of the characters change and grow. And they are all pursued, till the end by their own demons as well as their own angels. The dialogue speaks volumes. It is poetic, strange, slightly off kilter. I musn't forget funny. Just as an example. In the second to last episode, Joan tries cocaine, and as soon as she sniffs it she says, "I feel like someone has just given me some very good news." Bravo to the writers, actors and of course to Mr. Weiner. This is a masterpiece that deserves repeated viewings. Finally finished Mad Men,an outstanding TV show ,it's a 7 season one with 13 episodes each,it's a drama which takes place in the 60s filled with some suspense about advertising in general but contains a lot of relationship clichÃ©s,a lot of love scenes, i was really into it and got used so fast to the characters ,i hated some and loved some and was even neutral with some others. Each person in this show has its own flaws and qualities the main character is Don Draper who is a 40 year old handsome and Manly man ,who was raised up in a whore house and clearly he had a bad childhood,once grown up he got the chance to work in an advertising company "sterling cooper" thanks to his talent and intelligence and of course Roger who discovered him. but beside being nearly perfect,he was a damaged man always wanting to escape reality,he loves strangers ,money and the smell of new cars,he loves women,strong and independent ones,he made a lot of mistakes,he broke hearts,he hurt people including his wife Betty whom he cheated on. Don Draper is a complicated man,who doesn't love or cherish himself but in the end he got the chance to really know his true self and be more mature especially after the death of his wife. Jon Hamm is a really talented actor. Now for Peggy one of the principle characters of the show who has a strong personality ,she grew up in an old-fashioned environment and once she got a job in sterling cooper she tried to change herself to fit in,since she felt like she was the only reserved girl in the company,she tried smoking,getting out with men who weren't her type at all but she was ambitious and a little feminist in mind ,she couldn't accept the fact that men always treated women that way,they were always seen as just a body ,cooking and making love. she didn't see herself as one of those women,but in the last seasons she got to know her self better. Elisabeth Moss is one of the best actresses I've ever seen ,her performance in Mad Men was perfect. Peter Campbell as well is a great actor. The last episode was outstanding,except for the Betty part which was a little bit disturbing. "Nostalgia is not as good as it used to be", my freshman English teacher took those lines from me. <br/><br/>In my estimation, this is a terrific conditional event on how far the fork travels. <br/><br/>The ability of writers to replace Shakespeare on loose-leaf is the beauty of a movie that has no budget on how to replace the word vision for a scenes of special places.<br/><br/>As far as I am concerned the only thing that has changed in the movie is world leaders and how we have to not offend them in space or time.<br/><br/>The laws of girl meets man seem to still tilt just like the helm of a ship. Pretty people doing everything that we could not do for ourselves.<br/><br/>We need to protect pretty people from the ugly court. It takes weather women to keep these temperatures in every city and someone to realize, at 39, go home a finish the reap on your own, not that the set replaced everyone else for you job virtues.<br/><br/>Let us admit it, romantic attraction, sexual attraction or sexual behavior between persons of the opposite sex or gender is the liberal occasion all other sexuality has been given. Sure if it does not work out with natural position then all the other recovery feelings happen. Those inter-plays that allow men and women are the pyramid of the chaos we enjoy.<br/><br/>January is maybe or maybe not.<br/><br/>Anyway, when it comes to my heart, I never give it to anyone but the love in the garden where the snakes just can never get lime lights.<br/><br/>God Bless the miracle of writing in ink and let Steinway play on!<br/><br/>I am sure you understand that in America, the pharaoh has locomotive breath and one divorce to pay for the rest.<br/><br/>It is not really true that Christ did not have orgies or Moses, but they did nothing to sell hell. The last few episodes of Mad Men, in which Don no longer has to worry about being Dick - the secret is out already and no one cares - and also no longer has to worry about whether his company is swallowed whole by a soul-less humongous corporate entity - that is also a fait accompli - are far from light and airy. He is adrift, a man with no connections, as befits a person whose demons just run too deep. It is almost too painful to watch as he collapses on the couch of his last connection, to be told, "you are not family." His real family, it turns out, is Roger, who is there to fish him out of the pool, and sell the company when Don needs a boost; Roger too appears to be only left with Don; Roger's daughter abandons him as he abandoned her for the workplace. You root for handsome, clever, and dapper Don Draper, who put on a slick suit and a false name to crawl out of poverty and the literal brothel in which he was raised. Don gives his car to a young dopple ganger, a young boy desperately stuck in the middle of nowhere- saying "don't blow this." So Don is not just a heartless corporate hatchet man who almost monotonously, even helplessly, destroys every meaningful relationship - there is some heart there, too. As Roger says to Peggy, as she skates around the remnants of the company he headed and lost (lost in large part to save Don) - "wasn't it fun?" And yes - it was. For us, too. Bittersweet, but fun. This is a TV show that gets too much to the heart of the truth of America, where we spend much more time "faking it until we make it" at work than with our own spouses and children. In some ways, Mad Men is a warning. Watch out, or all you will have left, really, is the next great ad campaign for Coca Cola. Although Mad men might not be my favorite TV show of all time, it certainly is a masterpiece. The plot itself could use a little more beef in it at times though. That been said, there's nothing you can dislike about it. It is one of the best written series one could hope for. Matthew Weiner scored big with this idea.<br/><br/>The idea of a show about advertising didn't call my attention at first,but hell, this is brilliant. The psychological evolution of its characters is beautiful and flawless, and seeing them go through so much makes you get hooked easily. It speaks a lot about the life of those ad men and women of the 60's, who were miserable despite their sharp looks.<br/><br/>I don't wanna write a long review about the show so I can avoid spoiling, but this show is one for the ages. Don's character is so damn well written, constructed and so amazingly performed by Hamm that it's hard to put into words. One of the very best main characters to ever exist.<br/><br/>In short, this is an adult show that people with taste and appreciation for great acting and interested in people's psychological features will enjoy. If you're looking for action, or a fast-paced show this is not the one for you. All in all, I was pretty impressed with how well written it is, few shows are as good developed as this one. This is a fairly good show. To me, though I'm only 29, it gives a welcome context to the upheavals of the mid and late 60's - why every one who was not a well-heeled, East Coast, college educated, hetero WASP male got fed up. Because in this show, that's pretty much ALL you're gonna see: these guys living it up, barely working, partying, whoring, full of anti-semitism and naked prejudice, living like kings and yet still feeling empty and misunderstood. Your heart will not bleed. If anything, if you think enough about it, it will depress you to think how the Conservatives ran against the civil rights movements of the 60's and how much we seem, in our much less affluent, much more tired way, to have boomeranged back to all that. PC's cover, nothing's changed, and Mad Men will bring that home to you. Mad Men is not some sort of retro soap opera or nostalgic mystery. it's a depiction of characters who are more real than many of the people watching it - or at least reviewing it here:) There's more going on in it than anyone could soak up in one viewing, but it's not done melodramatically; you have to concentrate on what each character wants - and a lot of the time they don't know themselves, like real people. Themes of parenthood, identity, love, power - if you expect it all to explained for you you've got the wrong channel. Each character has a psychology they're trying to deal with (or not), each has a deep need, and each of them is really badly equipped to deal with the life they've found themselves living, like real people. And Mad Men is about the conflicts between them, and the way some of them swim while others sink. It rewards loyalty, which is unusual in a TV world that usually offers instant gratification. You know what they say - it's better to travel hopefully than to arrive. Mad Men, like the best drama, is all about the journey. Enjoy it while it lasts. The haters, and those with a 30-second attention span will prevail.<br/><br/>And of course, once SKY (the media Midas) got its claws in, Mad Men lost its edge. Still very good, just a bit formulaic. I can't help but like this series. It is beautifully shot, cleverly written and I just love the time period. However, the self admitted liberal writer and creator goes way over the top in his attempt to paint my Father's generation as a bunch of over masculine, bigoted, callous, ugly Americans. His message is obvious. Look at how we used to be. Better be thankful that diversity, multiculturalism, feminism and sensitive men have replaced these cavemen. Never mind that our public schools were the best in the world in 1960, our streets were safer and our children had childhoods. Some of the shots at the sixties are just too much. The gynecologist gives the young Secretary birth control pills and tells her, "This doesn't mean you can become the town pump." My Mother would have knocked him on his ass! A man smacks another man's kid across the face because he is running in the house during a party. Yes, parents were a lot more likely back then to discipline another person's child but a smack in the face? No way was that acceptable. Another ass whooping would have been in store for that guy. But my favorite over the top example is when the evil tobacco tycoon utters the phrase, "After all, the Indians gave us this land." Oh my God! Talk about evil America. Give me a break. Accomplishment and smiling faces all around stand in for the misery that is life in this world of Mad Men. The structured facade of accomplishment is so fragile under the stress of the stable illusion these characters try to maintain. The simplest crack in this hollow suit of armor cannot be mended by a shot of booze. It remains, choking on the fumes of cigarettes and how do you do's. These characters walk on in their daily lives trying to maintain some semblance of sanity. What we see is that the innocence of this time in our history was not innocent at all, merely more adept at keeping the demons from creeping into the light, misery buried & depression sedated. The human condition, whether in ancient, medieval, or modern times, struggles to understand itself, struggles to gather some meaning behind it all, behind our jobs, our family, our existence. Who am I? Just a pandering ad man trying to sell shaving cream in order to pay the bills? Or am I more? Those stares off into the distance we see these characters so often indulge in, is a hand reaching out for meaning, an attempt to make some sense of it all. Can they find it? Can anybody? This is pertaining to the first episode. I agree that the smoke and drinking bit is overly done and seems contrived. Lets hope the writers get this out of the way or at least make it look natural. The secretary hits are a little out of line.I'm from that era and I don't remember that much crassness. At least not for a few weeks. But I know the writers are trying to get the mood of the Office personnel in focus. I remember that there was a lot of laughter in those days plus all the drinking and smoking and hitting on the office gals . I think the series might line-up to be good if some precautions are taken. Don't over-style -it. While watching Mad Men I wasn't sure if I was gonna die from boredom or from lung cancer. The art direction for this series is A+ the set design, the cars, the outfits, colors, just everything looks really really good but everything after that fails. Its obvious the producers thought it was important to accurately portray the social & cultural norms of the time so there is lots of smoking, drinking, sexual harassment, sexism, sex, antisemitism & racism. Not to mention kids riding in cars without seat belts and did I mention smoking? Smoking in meetings, pregnant women smoking, just cigarettes in every conceivable scene. We are bludgeoned with cigarette smoking, we get it, people smoked during these times!!! it's overkill. They seem to highlight alot of norms of the time that would be objectionable today, which, while interesting, are no substitute for plot or character development.<br/><br/>Showing these all of these things isn't the problem, in fact they could greatly enhance the story if the story wasnt so bland to begin with. It suffers from a lack of dramatic urgency, a lack of tension and a lack of meaningful things happening. This is made worse by characters who are one dimensional that you dont care about. Don Draper is hailed is a top ad exec, and if he struggles to win a new client it isn't portrayed with any tension. You never feel like there are any stakes. If he loses a client, fine, he'll probably get another one, he's Don Draper after all. The drama just isn't dramatic, the women all seem to be pretty easy and the guys are all horn dogs. Not that this isn't somewhat accurate but its played up and in lieu of an actual meaningful story developing it just rings hollow.<br/><br/>I couldnt make it past the 5th episode before I had to quit. I'm not invested in the lives of any of these characters and the story just seems to meander about, with this or that low stake incident happening. But iI will credit them this, they've made it look DAMN good while its all happening. A missed oppurtunity imho. I started watching Mad Men in January of this year, starting from the very beginning. After the first episode, I honestly did not understand why everyone was raving on how awesome this show was. I found it to be mediocre and boring. But for some reason I watched the second episode a couple weeks later. It still didn't grab my attention, but I kept watching the show. About halfway through season 1, I started to realize that this show was actually pretty good. After season 1, season 2 was just as good. Season 3 really made this one of my favorite shows to watch.<br/><br/>Mad Men is about the Sterling Cooper ad agency in 1960s New York. One thing that is very cool about this show is the difference in their time period and ours today. Mad Men travels along through the 60s through the perspective of these rich ad executives. I really like the research and effort the writers put into making it historically accurate, and the way it features all of the famous landmarks in history from that decade. The show's writers also provide great dialogue and outstanding characters. The biggest reason that this show keeps getting better and better is because you really start to become fascinated by the characters and want to see and watch more of them. If the show seems dull and boring at first, it will get really good as you start to get used to the characters.<br/><br/>Most everything about Mad Men is great. The acting is superb, the story is pretty good, and even though I'm only in my teens I really think, for the most part, they successfully recreated the 1960s. Mad Men isn't the show for people who live on watching violence and action shows or anything of the like, but it is a great show if you like strong characters and you can really pay attention and digest everything that occurs within the show. Like I said, I'm only a teenager and I still love this show. It is great for anyone who is mature and sophisticated enough for a show driven by dialogue and characters, regardless of how old you are. This is probably the best TV series that I have seen in my life. As far as I am concerned there are no flaws with this show so I consider it a masterpiece.<br/><br/>The choice of subject for this period piece is excellent and it basically defines American essences of the period and how advertising is the heart of the American vision of themselves.<br/><br/>The choice of characters is excellent. The acting is superb. The scripts are highly original and extremely well written and so are the direction and cinematography.<br/><br/>The interaction between politics of the era, wars, media and advertising is investigated with just the right touch.<br/><br/>Love it There aren't a lot of other words to describe Mad Men, and that's one of its weaknesses.<br/><br/>It seems like Mad Men either clicks with you or it doesn't. It's about people in the 50's, and their lives. It has moments that are funny, but it's definitely not a comedy. Sometimes it's dramatic. Other times it seems to go out of its way to show you what specific events were like for the people living then. Still other times, it's about advertising, explaining how their choice of words can elicit responses in people, or putting a subtle spin on something whose reputation has been tarnished.<br/><br/>There is a lot of depth to the characters, though a lot of times it seems like they went out of the way to exacerbate their flaws. However they do a good job of focusing more time on the more interesting people, and less time on the more one-dimensional supporting characters.<br/><br/>The show has its downsides. Many subplots go ignored for several episodes, only to pop up again later with little explanation. Things that seem like a huge deal one day aren't mentioned again. Sometimes while trying to show events during a montage, they don't translate what is going on very clearly. Rarely in any episode are you left content, most of them end with you feeling vaguely alarmed/depressed/unsure/anxious about whatever just happened. Unless of course you're too easily bored to make any kind of emotional connections to the subject matter.<br/><br/>The show - much like the characters - can be flawed or unlikable at times. However, it all remains very stylish and very interesting. The writing is strong, the acting is strong, and one of the best parts about this show is what lies under the surface. Its American Beauty-esquire approach and calm facade while everything seethes underneath is what makes for such exquisite drama. The actors can say more in silence with their faces and demeanor than they could with words, which would fall short anyway. It is a nod to the human condition, and the affects of society on it, one of the reasons why it is so aptly set in the time period it is set in. The issues it deals with are complex, and it calls on the viewer to actually think on them and use their intuition to make sense of what's going on. If you're looking for an easy watch, perhaps this is the wrong show for you. The pace and timing are perfection. It's true to its time period. I find it absolutely refreshing. Mad Men is captivating, both as drama and as an almost scientific examination of the 60's. It touches on so many aspects of life and culture and does so at a dramatic pace which is great viewing. It reminds me of the Broadway play Promises, Promises which was based on The Apartment. Like the musical, Mad Men fairly bristles with energy and what passed for hipness at the time. Casual conversation, byplay between the sexes, exploitation and competition--it's all there and it is eye-fillingly presented. Little vignettes are tossed in like throw-away lines and they, too, are telling. I love the way that characters are developed. Many layers are gradually peeled away, and in the doing these people become more interesting and human. Those of us who lived in this time frame may even learn things about ourselves. If the measure of a television show were how guilty people (men in this case) felt after watching it, then this is the best movie of all time. Of course, by this standard, church is much more interesting. <br/><br/>However, if the measure of a show is how much you identify with the actors, or how much you become sucked into the turmoil of their lives, then this is truly the worst television show of all time. The mere fact that anyone could prefer this show over Breaking Bad is the most depressing thing I've ever heard. <br/><br/>Sure I know that there were plenty of sexist people in the 1960s. I'm sure it was very difficult to be a professional woman in this period. But was every single man a pig with no redeeming qualities? I doubt it, despite the picture this show paints. I would go as far as to say the only redeeming qualities that the men of this show have is their ability to sexually attract a professional woman. See what a wonderful future "ground-breaking" televisions shows like this will lead us to? A world without sexism where the measure of a man is his ability to seduce women for the purpose of short-term affairs. I can't wait. (insert sarcasm here) It's a terrific show. The writing is dense, the acting is measured and respects the audience's intelligence. Much is said regarding the authenticity of the 'advertising world' depicted, but that really misses the point. The point is Don Draper and the tragedy of his self-exile from his own life; a deeply isolated yet remarkably soulful individual who has been 'given' a chance at a perfect life. The problem is, the perfect life he creates leaves no space for his considerable imperfections, largely the psychological scars of a horrible childhood. Accordingly, he perpetually places his idyllic, early 1960s existence - a trophy wife, a boy and a girl, a house in the suburbs and a creative, executive job - in dire peril through a desperate search for an outlet for his residual pain and, at times, desperate loneliness (usually he is simply 'alone' rather than 'lonely' in true male style). This is great drama.<br/><br/>Offset this with a very playful and frequently poignant exploration of 1960s values, behaviours and mores, clashing jarringly with so much in our current lives that we take for granted, and it's a great ride. The insight to the workings of a 60s ad agency is certainly intriguing, but far from the point of the show.<br/><br/>Personally I thought the second season started somewhat slowly, but it picked up and the last four episodes had me totally hooked in. If you decide to watch the series you have to prepare to watch at least 30 - 40 episodes of irrelevant material. To fill the time they decided to make too many stories that just take up the time and it brings no value to the story. I think they could squeeze all of it in 3 seasons. It is very slow, sometimes it is ok but sometimes is just a drag. I read all the good reviews and now I am disappointed. Whatever happened to this show? Where's the intrigue? Story lines like the mystery surrounding Don's past have been discarded in favor of what feels like something of an exploitation movie being reworked for broadcast as a soap opera. The show is shifting its focus from the men to their madness; what was a character study is now more of an examination of the idiosyncrasies and immorality of the 1960s. It started out as being daring and different but has inexorably grown more formulaic.<br/><br/>Each episode's message is "look how bad the 60s were!" Unfortunately, it doesn't make for a captivating TV show. Every week's installment can be summarized as 45 minutes of smoking, shrewd machinations and business negotiations, sex (adultery or otherwise), more smoking, and more drinking. You'd think half of the characters would be dead by now (self-immolation the most likely cause of death).<br/><br/>The problem is, I wouldn't care if Don himself went up in flames right before my eyes. The monotony and lack of variety in the show's plot dulls the senses after a while. In Breaking Bad, arguably the best TV show on right now, it's tough to watch even a villain die. We observe each character in so many environments and contexts and see so many sides of them that we can't help but care for them because they're so human. After five years, I don't know how the one-note caricatures of Mad Men will look in the coming seasons. I don't really care, either. There's an awful lot of dross in TV drama these days. That's why it's so easy to miss a pearl like Mad Men.I only came across it in series two,but was immediately hooked.Unlike the usual staccato monotone screeching that is the standard TV dialogue, these people talk in sentences and paragraphs. Sometimes intelligent conversations go on for several minutes.It is very easy to empathise with the characters, in particular the slightly lonely, sad, but intelligent and sensitive Peggy. I was a teenager in the 60's,and for me this series evokes the period really well. The dialogue crackles. The spirit of Noel Coward and Terence Rattigan lives on! (Across the pond ,anyway). Some say it is a bit too slowly paced. Rubbish! You can rush a McDonalds, but never a gourmet meal.<br/><br/>Some predictions for series 3. (No spoilers- I've not even read the synopses).<br/><br/>The libidinous Don Draper comes a terrible cropper over some woman, and gets chucked off the Board. His already dotty wife goes completely crackers and ends up in the loony bin.<br/><br/>The aforementioned Peggy, with her copy writing skills,takes Don's place on the Board.<br/><br/>As the 60's advance, the gorgeous and amply talented Joan appears prominently in every episode and takes to wearing shorter and shorter mini-skirts and skimpier and skimpier tops. This culminates in her turning up to work one day in a topless dress. Stirling Cooper (and myself) go into meltdown and the series ends. Wow....acting is great. So confronting and I am so glad that i didnt live in that age. I would be the first feminist. ...... I really liked this show and was totally invested in the intrigues and the characters. After season 5 everything turns super flat. Really really Boring and the typical convesation loops appear. I had really hard time to focus anymore and it was just uninteresting. Everyone seem to overract. Pete character was a joke, it was like watching any cheap soap opera. And that terrible Megan character was the Most irritating. Just the look of her naive plastic barbiedoll character glued to Don for so many seasons destroyed the whole magic of Don's womanizer style. She is the worst of all Dons womens and really drag the show down into that Boring LA territory the last seasons. Nothing happens we dont allready knows gonna happen to her. And Wow.. the last seasons mat be the Most draged out episodes ive seen.
Mad Men is US history with the cars, women, brands, clothing. The 60s is slick cool and noir and americana sure, but the show makes the mistakes any other show makes. It goes on to long and the sparkle thst made Mad Men good is far far gone. Even the actors seem tired after season 5. Nobody gives anymore convincing performances at all. None. I had to go to New York for five weeks and most of the time I was stuck in the apartment with only a laptop for company. My host had a netflix sub so after a few days I was hooked on Madmen and Portlandia.
Let's compare the two for a moment... Portlandia is a fantastic program but it is spotty and gets a bit repetitive. It's a great spoof on West Coast life and captures some of the treehugging mentality perfectly.<br/><br/>Madmen too is a fantastic program, it's sobering to think that the culture in the offices of the day is so different from the starched shirt attitude that now prevails and that this is only a scene or two away from a comedy series too.<br/><br/>It's well acted and the scripts really do a great job in taking us back to what it was like when women went to the office with the intent of finding a husband. Men ruled the roost and could say anything they liked or screw any chick they took a fancy to.<br/><br/>While it's interesting to see the subtle changes that creep in from episode to episode and season to season it does get a bit hard to see all of the booze and the cigarettes and think that there was that much excess.<br/><br/>Of course there was lots of drinking, smoking and sex in the offices I worked in back in the 60's and 70's ( sadly I only got the booze and the smoking) but I don't recall anyone slugging back liquor like it was pop. Maybe things were a little more conservative in England and Canada?<br/><br/>In any event I started to get tired of the Don Draper role with his ability to bed just about anything that came along and not think twice about it, and you know that the entertainment has run its course when you start fast forwarding through the more intimate scenes.<br/><br/>The deeper story, about how the Ad agencies manipulate people's desires, is allowed full expression without much in the way of countervailing voices and the treatment of the lower hirelings was a part of the series that really got my back up. (which must mean that it was done well!)<br/><br/>It strengthened my belief that America is a corporate dictatorship without a meaningful conscience. Corporate conscience only exists to increase sales, no other reason. ( As an aside, what use is it to fine a corporation? Nobody feels any pain)
The spoils go to the most well connected and it's a myth that everybody has an equal chance.
Big corporations run things in the States with no real regard for the working peasant, and the advertising agencies help them do it.<br/><br/>To be truthful, the series went on a season or two longer than it should have, it was a bit of chore getting through the later episodes, but then again that's why programs come in and out of favor This show was the best series on TV for its first two seasons, and maybe even the first three. There are many reasons for this. First of all is the degree that the production team went to keep things accurate for the time. They went out of their way to have the real clothes, set pieces, cars, drinks, absolutely everything to the best of their ability. Also the attitudes of the people were spot on for the period and they used it to get great laughs as well as drama but did not overdo it, which many people would have. The acting is great from almost every character. The writing is also superior. There are not many things to point to that are not great in this show. In the last season or possibly two it fell off a bit but that's not so much that the show isn't great any more as that it just understandably could not keep pace with the amazing if not perfect work they had done in the early seasons. If you have not seen this series check it out! Just one season left! I am a TV and movie maniac. I've seen thousands of films. I thought I knew all that could be happen. I was wrong. I couldn't really tell of any sequence how it will turn or end. This is superb! And best of it: it seems so real, so authentic, so probable. And: I'm quite used to violence in the movies and often, I find that necessary for the tension. In "mad men" - I don't miss it a second. In Contrary. So even my wife which never watches movies with me couldn't get off the TV. At last, one critic: the central theme of seasons 1-3 is perfect but somehow lost later. Especially season is nice to watch but in my opinion nothing more, unfortunately. So I'm looking forward to season six. Last but not least, I give 10 points out of 10. This is a television series unlike any other before and for those who take the trouble to follow it faithfully, it is truly rewarding. Set in an advertising agency in the 60s and the lives of the people working their and their families will be known as a historical masterpiece of capturing the essence of the era on screen. The production standards set a standard for any future series set in the past.<br/><br/>The dialog is often so surprising and well written you hang on every word. The characters are so completely rounded flawed and interesting that you feel they are real.<br/><br/>Don Draper (Jon Hamm) the ad man who can't say no is one of the most interesting and flawed characters on television. Vincent Kartheiser as the entitled Pete Campbell is hilarious. John Slattery as Roger Sterling the founding partner of the firm is a scene stealer.<br/><br/>The beautiful and talented female cast are all excellent and their position at home and work at that time is captured in all the different characters. Elisabeth Moss at Peggy Olsen the young female secretary who becomes a copywriter. Christina Hendricks as Joan Holloway the office manager is such a moving and expressive actress. She deserves an Emmy or Golden Globe. January Jones as Don's ex wife Betty is so many things - silly vain lacking in maternal instincts, she fascinates endlessly. Jessica Pare as Megan Don's present wife is the opposite of Betty but just as interesting. Kiernan Shipka as Sally, Don's daughter, the victim of her parents' sins is terrific for such a young actress.<br/><br/>The supporting cast that has come and gone are excellent especially Julia Ormond as Megan's sophisticated cynical mother.<br/><br/>There are some episodes and plot lines that are dull and unnecessary mainly in the earlier seasons. But when it's good it's the best series on television. I just wish each season were longer. Hope it goes on as long as possible. It doesn't help that there's a new actor to play Bobby. To me he looks underage compared to the original time-line. Yet the actor playing the new Bobby is ten/eleven years old in 1968.<br/><br/>That moment in the movie theater with the AA movie usher, and how Bobby felt sorry for him. I think Don sees himself through Bobby.<br/><br/>I've been re-watching Mad Men on Netflix, and I just watched the episode where Bobby was punished by Betty, yet Don told her to back off because of Dick Whitman's abuse by his real father. When Bobby heard Don's story about his early life, Bobby says "we need to get you another father". Priceless! The show is so fabulous, the actors are wonderful, the directing and the dress designing are perfect but I am not gonna talk about that sort of things! I am gonna talk about the pure reality and naked truth the show presents which sometimes terrifying me! there is a reckless truth about life and reality in the show that can make you nervous, no wonder if you get angry and feeling insecure without any reason during watching the show and after that! Unlike the other series and movies sentimentalism and fantasy has no place in Mad Men. The Mad Men doesn't tell us a beautiful lies in our faces. This show doesn't decorate the reality with nice things for us so we can fool ourselves with it (although the characters trying to do that all the time) !<br/><br/>Mad Men is a pure and bitter reality. People hate each other and it is what it is ! there is no tearjerker peacemaking at all. People are cheating on each other,they are cheating on themselves and life is cheating on them all the time and there is nothing you can do! Mad Men doesn't tell us everything is gonna be OK! (although Don keep saying that to others)! I adore this show and I carry on an unknown anger with me all the time, probably because it's facing me with the reality with no make up on his face...<br/><br/>And the main location is genius! There is a place you can see how cruel life can be, how cruel people can be and like it or not money always says the first word ! (that reminds me of David Mamet's fabulous screenplay Glen Garry Glen Rose ) Yes, literature and cinema making life beautiful and tolerable for us but I love Mad Men because beautiful lies has no place in it and it doesn't keep us in darkness for relief. So Mad Men is the one you can trust ! I can honestly say that I do not watch television. I think over the last few months I have watched BBC News, CNN and maybe a bit of PBS. I am a member of this wonderful invention called NETFLIX and decided to attempt to find a show that I could actually get in to. MAD MEN is that show.<br/><br/>First off, Don Drapper (Hamm) is so unbelievably sexy as the ad exec at Cooper & Sterling that it is impossible not to care. But, as a female (and male for that matter) gets past that you discover that under that pretty face is the mind/body/spirit of a man who is running from the past, afraid of the present and uncertain about the future. The fact that the show set in one of the most infamous times in American History, the 1960's, is the perfect backdrop for Drapper. I do not know who made the final call to cast Hamm, but well done. He can be a slime, a confident jerk, womanizer, chain-smoker and constant drinker of his 'Old Fashions' but even with all his faults- you the viewer cheer him on, forgive him by the end of the episode and want to make sure you see what happens next. Don Drapper is a class unto himself as a television character. <br/><br/>Next, the supporting cast is simply amazing. The 'skirts' including Peggy Olson (Moss) and Joan Harris (Hendricks) are each forces of nature that the men of Madison avenue continue to keep in check. They are smart, sexy women who live in man's world, yet often hold their own and get just as dirty as the men to advance their careers. If this is the foundation of the feminism movement bring it on. <br/><br/>MAD MEN is a drama, but does not move too slow or too quick. There are interesting story lines with each character that uniquely interact wonderfully. It is not a show about advertising- it is a show about the great, amazing Americans who laid the foundation the life that we now know and love. This is defiantly a man's world- and it is very thoughtful how the writers craft each line, each movement and every single scene to make sure that the viewer understands that we have come along way since the 60s- but we still have a lot to learn about others.<br/><br/>There is such potential here for an entire genre. If the fellows over at AMC can write a period drama television show this well...I want one about the 1950s, 1940s, hell even the 1908s! Thanks to my friend - colleague who recommended me this movie. I'd like to mention 2 points.<br/><br/>Living in Russia the perception of the main topics of MadMen is quite different. Actually, the sexism, drinking in the office and smoking all around is quite normal in Russian small and mid-sized company offices now in 2000s - about 50 years after 'MadMen' time. <br/><br/>I liked the accurate transfer of the atmosphere and scenery of 60s made by the crew. Lets compare MadMen with brilliant Mendes's 'Revolutionary Road' and we find much of a kind, mentioning different budgets. Glamour of Madison av. makes the viewer feel a bit jealous and want to get to 60s to live such a life with all that overwhelming self-assurance of a 'madman'. That means one of the main goals done. <br/><br/>The movie's intonation is very let's say true. That's how business made, that's how family's broken. That's how life's spent. It may seem cynical and too straightforward sometimes, but to the point. Don's character is written and played very well, he is alive, i know such businessmen and their issues are quite the same.<br/><br/>All in all the tempo of the action let's time and space to think it over and thanks authors for that. I just love, love, love this drama. The wonderful sets, costumes, actors, scripts, this program just keeps on delivering and on multiple viewings you seem to just get more from the program. I love the way each episode is a slow burner. I love the way we are allowed to get to know each character just a little and we want to keep watching to learn a little more of what makes them tick . If the 60s were as sophisticated as this I would just have loved to have been there. There are great bits of comedy, attitudes to health and safety, environmental issues, women's acceptance of the status quo and their use of their sexual allure to get where they want to go. Even though I am a female mostly glad to live in this century and although I am glad that women and men are on equal footings in the workplace and in life it is interesting to see men acting like men in a male dominated world. It is almost refreshing as this is a world before men were removed of their goolies and were made to become feminine. Whether that is a good or bad thing is still out with the jury. Interestingly this series is written by mainly female writers and is a credit to all concerned. It is a mystery how these men who behave so badly towards their wives, girlfriends, children etc... seem to still gain our sympathy and wish to understand them. All of the women characters are so interesting and it is fascinating watching them interact with the men in a men's world. Hope this show lasts for several more seasons.<br/><br/>Thanks to all concerned Caroline Ireland. Not sure what to say. This is easily the best sitcom ever written. Watched it when it first aired and then again 10 years later. So good! I finally, like a decade later (i.e. the past two weeks), marathon-streamed this on Netflix. I found the first few seasons to be really great, somewhere between 9 and 10 in ratings. It started to wear on me as it got into season five or so. Maybe because I was intensely trying to get through it before its run ended on NetFlix. It began to get repetitive to me, and a little bit outlandish in places. I haven't done any research on it but I think I read somewhere they had a seven-year commitmment, so maybe it went on a season or two longer than it should have. I also felt that it got a bit soap operaish in places. Maybe it always was and I didn't notice it so much in the earlier seasons.
That said, I never DID get to see the last six episodes, as its run ended about a night earlier than I thought it would. But I also found that I didn't really care so much at that point. I do hope to catch those some day.<br/><br/>The acting of the series was superb all around. The set design, costumes, and authenticity of everything was really superb, really right on. Obviously a ton of research went into it. And the music was fabulous.<br/><br/>So I was torn with my rating above; it decreased as the series progressed. But still, a "must see." Glad I caught it! Each character has a very complex and interesting character arc. Season 1: 8/10
Season 2: 8/10
Season 3: 8/10
Season 4: 9/10
Season 5: 9/10
Season 6: 8/10
Season 7: 8/10 Running from March 1960 to late 1970<br/><br/>MAD MEN takes back in time through the eyes of corporate suits in New York. At first it comes off a time piece, as the story very slowy advances showing the office and home life of our corporate suits (Characters), though it really picks up when Don begins his affairs and drinking and his pasts come to haunt him. Through that time we slowly begin to see the Camelot era waver in place of race issues, womens place in the workplace, Kennedy shot, Vietnam, and other disturbances to the status quo.<br/><br/>In addition to the faced paced corporate life of NYC we see a more homestead look at home with most the characters, times at parties and dinners, seeing how sociality has changed, I think one the main elements missing were grand set pieces as 90% of the show takes place in a home of office, as opposed to outside we could see the cars, people and colors of the time, but ohwell.<br/><br/>We see how the generation of the time responsed, aswell as to what drove the kids to do what they do, really displaying to audience across generations the story of the 60s.<br/><br/>Ultimatley its a story of change for the better or worse, we see old values and traditions falter, we see marriages come and go, we see old ideas about race, women and even smoking come under the light of change. Being a child of the sixties. I am glad that Mad Men like the Wonder Years keeps thing pretty accurate. They keep the evil Bloomberg New York out of sight and mind. And being a life long New Yorker. I like the little touches . Like the accuracy of the Checker cabs for that decade.
Well acted and written.
Didn't watch it when it first aired. I am up to Season five now on Netflix.
Well worth it. The show is very good, i never thought i will have the patience to go through it in the begininng but soon it got exciting and adicting. But the last season was a drag , it was disappointing especially how they ended it Detailing in this show is awesome, the way every thing is executed is just brilliant. Great acting, Great Writing and Great Cinematography. Love this show Honestly this show has been out for years I watched the first Season a few years ago and got bored felt no connection to the characters.
After hea ing so many good reviews I decided to revisit it. I have to admit it took until mid 3rd season to become hooked into ththe characters.
I actually ended up loving it. It definitely gets you thinking that's for sure. The attention to detail is excellent. The acting is great. The story lines are phenomenal. My only regret is that it took me eleven years to get around to watching it. You can't go in to Mad Men expecting explosions, action and guns. It's more like a high quality soap driven by the characters and their lives. If you love realism, you'll love Mad Men. Started slow in first couple of seasons, but by the end I loved it! Not quite on same level as some of my favourite series however a solid 8/10 This is one of the best shows i've ever seen, its very different and it really involves the viewer to think about subtle things that are hinted at though out the show witch makes for a great watching experience. what i like the most is all of the different character arks and the way they appear to be completely unrelated. in my view there is no main character in mad men. an under appreciated show in large parts of Europe. and i will continue to recommend it to all ma frieNdz I finished the last season of this show a couple of years ago and yet I really feel I need to write a review about what I consider to be a work of cinematographic art, as well as the best TV series I've ever watched.<br/><br/>1. The acting: superb. I can't think of a character that was less than perfectly portrayed. Each and one of them was of a completely different nature and, nevertheless, constantly spot-on, never overdoing it, never attempting to betray what seems to be the true essence of the character. And believe me, these are complex, all too humanly ambivalent and realistically evolving characters. Thanks to Mad Men I've discovered a bunch of brilliant actors.<br/><br/>2. Historical recreation and background. Being myself in advertising and having achieved a decent level of expertise and experience in international media planning, copywriting, creative direction, analytics and account management, I was blown away by the degree of precision with which the show succeeded in portraying the finest nuances of many historical facts, the dynamics of the industry, the professional chemistry inside and among agencies, the moral standards and the psychological complexity of the characters. If you loved Mad Men just like I did, consider reading "The Real Mad Men". The book goes over the real events and people that inspired the show and it's as fun as the series. I had read the book before watching the show, but I suggest proceeding inversely.<br/><br/>3. The language, the humor, the psychology, the references. English is not my native language, but my comprehension of what is said at any given time is complete and not limited to the realm of literal interpretation. I'm not bragging, but I do think you need to feel really comfortable with this language in order to appreciate not only the wit and beauty of the dialog, but also of that which is not said. Reading between the lines and grasping the truly complex nature of the characters and events presented in this show was one of the most exciting things to me and this led me to the conclusion that anyone oblivious to these little realizations might not enjoy the show all that much.<br/><br/>4. Human, all too human. After Pete's first appearances in the plot you can't help but be annoyed by him, and yet only after a couple of episodes, while he's still proving himself a douche, you can tell you'll end up loving him. The same goes for most of the characters. Ultimately you can't help feeling empathy for most of them because, notwithstanding the fact that the vast majority of them are hugely immoral individuals, they succeeded throughout the show to reveal their most inherently human nature. Well, Harry might be the exception, but that also served a purpose.<br/><br/>5. One of the least anachronistic shows I've ever seen. If someone felt offended by the various depictions of that era's sexism, racial segregation or other subjects, they should reconsider their interpretation. TV and films usually narrate events full of extreme attitudes towards a multiplicity of social groups; sometimes it's extreme hate, other times we observe dogmatic political correctness which instead of helping achieve integration, perpetuates an image of minorities as if they were bound to be hopeless victims. MM doesn't go down those roads. My opinion on this subject is not based on personal experience (I'm 33 and I've only been a couple of times to the States as a tourist) and yet I'm convinced they've captured in the most objective and complete fashion the different shades of attitudes and ways that probably were at the core of New York's everyday life during a critical decade of transition towards a new model of society.<br/><br/>6. Do you remember Roger always being jealous of David Ogilvy, the Godfather of Advertising? Hilarious. Read Confessions of an Advertising Man. You'll love it.<br/><br/>7. In case you didn't know, the denomination "Mad Men" comes from the fact that most of the top NY ad agencies where on Madison Avenue and admen (and adwomen!) back in the sixties were often pretty wild and eccentric. At one point, I was fully ready to leave this show behind between the seasons 4 and 5 just for the fulfilling frustration poisoning my mind. But then realized, that's the brilliance in it. <br/><br/>The show is written and successfully carried through by the consistency of silent, slow life, actually screaming with its whole lung capacity about the desperate change of the world. The hard work for the women to get their voice out, having the same kind of rights as men or at least close to it, is represented very gracefully. War and changing societies keep everyone at their toes, seems like no one can't really keep up - hence the constant drinking and wild sex, changing partners and most importantly: not giving a s*hit about exactly, anything. <br/><br/>It never turns out the way it should, there is barely no consequences at all for the ones repeating their horrible deeds. This is the show that really makes you hate the main character and his face sickens you to the absolute point, and every time he gets a slap in the face with someones' rage, I feel deep joy. I will argue someone till to the end about the 'childhood dramas' that just naturally lead the main character on the way spreading misery all around him. I guess this is also where the point about the show comes to the surface. Main character's (Donald Draper) so called childhood dramas are NOT THAT bad even, so that it would justify him to repeat the asshole behavior. It's sheer exaggeration, all of it, all of him. <br/><br/>Other characters bring their more positive pictures into the show, even though they are a bit gloomy as well. Search for the possible real love seems to be impossible, because there's always someone new and better. It's the fascination of something better, just like the show itself: advertising. You're greedy after all, we all are. We have something wonderful just in our hands, but not being able to see it. Something new always changes the course of our interest. Nothing is enough. We want more and we want it now. No matter the consequences. And then we'll wonder and cry why the life is so cruel to us, we are we treated this way, I don't deserve this. We'll grieve for what is gone and ponder, why we just can't find someone who's truly ready to love us. <br/><br/>That's us. That's our own reality right now as well. That's consumption, capitalism and the weak nature of us, blind belief to anything beautiful. That's Mad Men, and you just cannot stop looking at it. The truth. Mad Men is hands down the greatest show that I had the pleasure of watching. AMC and HBO have graced me to watch shows like Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, The Sopranos, The Wire, etc. Although these are excellent shows, Mad Men was able to just a little extra for me.<br/><br/>From the show's music choice, to it's superb character development, and to amazing episodes like The Suitcase, Mad Men is second to none in my book.<br/><br/>It's a shame that this show doesn't get enough praise on IMDb (only an 8.6) compared to other great shows. I guess some people think that the show feels "boring", but this is not the case at all.<br/><br/>I feel like I was the same way, I wasn't really interested in the show until I had seen at least 6-7 episodes of the first season. So I say if you're on the fence about watching this show because of negative reviews, just know that show is an acquired taste; therefore, give it at least the first season to see it you like it.<br/><br/>This show really is the best of the best and maybe, one day, AMC could produce a show of such high caliber again. I gave it a 10 and I haven't been watching it for ten years, obviously, so it's an equally exaggerated score. This is because I am breathing easy after being extremely nervous about watching the end of Series 7. I have been delaying in case Don came to a similar gruesome ending to Tony Soprano and Walter White. But no! Things turned out just right for Peggy, Stan, Peter, Roger et al and some of the more malicious probably think Betty got her just desserts, though I shed a tear with Sally. Does anyone care about Megan? Not me. But the vindication of a new happy Don's loopy commitment to advertising was the best delightful surprise, not to mention a huge relief. Reminded me of the happy round up at the end of Six Feet Under. Thank you thank you Matthew Weiner. (except for never letting us know what happened to poor Sal) Thank you masked man, from all of us to all of you. It is 4 am, woke out of a dream and thought of you after watching the last episode of Mad Men last night. I had bailed from the series somewhere around the middle of the 5th season, bitterly disappointed with the collapse of what had been perhaps the best art I had experienced in that medium. Well, I'm glad I went back, for old time sake, and gave you another chance. You did not disappoint. You now reside in that place that seems to be where the brain meets the gut, writhing in that crazy feedback loop of thought and emotion called humanity, along with Magic Mountain, Shooting an Elephant, Lem's Solaris, Tarkovsky's Rublev, and other chimeras. I've binge watched all 7 seasons and loved it, though it was slow comparatively. But I think this show requires a second viewing to understand the reasons behind many characters' behaviors and evolution. The characters are so complex and multi layered along with the writing that it's hard to observe everything when you binge watch. Writing is absolutely superb along with great performances and authentic characters. I think the creators have got feel of the period, the show was set in absolutely right along with the character behaviors in that period. The relationship between Don and Peggy is one of the most beautiful things to be shown on TV. Don't miss this if you like Drama and character driven shows. I agree with the comments here suggesting the lack of focus with the storyline's progress, but that too could be said of The Sopranos. Elements were suddenly introduced, and then just as suddenly dropped (only to be revived the following season, or the one after). Mad Men is only in Season Two and it might need time to get these themes fully realized, and the story told.<br/><br/>I also wish there would be more of the business and art of advertising developed before our eyes. We get the sense that these are talented people, but we only get to see them be creative every so often on screen. Yet in the end, this is a story about Don Draper, not Madison Avenue. The time and place are the setting, a beautiful canvass to paint with; but the people remain the heart of the story. Their jobs are just that: their jobs. this series seems to concentrate on how almost all the men in that era were nothing but a prick, a typical male chauvinist pig, an adulterer, a self-centered egoist, a selfish moral-less husband, a loveless father, a pompous liar, etc, etc; they flirted, they seduced, they often had a quickie, a short fling, or a long term affair one after another, while some of the women were either very conservatively pathetic or, most of them just 100% sluts, whores with a 9-5 day jobs.<br/><br/>i could never understand why those male characters who had faithful, beautiful, loving and caring wives would still want to cheat on their spouses. these male characters treated their female colleagues like cheap commodities without any respect and at the same time, considered themselves a much much smarter, superior species than their opposite gender. but why these male characters always gave us a quite stupid impression?<br/><br/>but the most disgusting thing in every scene of this series is the 'chain smoking', no matter where and when; in the office, on the bus, on the train, at home, in bed, in airplane, at dinner table, at breakfast, during the fornication or love-making.....everybody, men and women non-stop smoking. i feel so sorry for those actors who in order to vividly and realistically portray that era, they had to smoke, even they didn't really have to inhale. but the 2nd-handed cigarette smoke must tortured them a lot. guess some of them might get lung cancer after this show. imagine all those spaces and rooms got the aftermath of stinking cigarette smoke that would never go away after the shootings.<br/><br/>i really didn't see anything that really showed these guys were indeed very smart in advertising business, most of them looked more like morons. in order to make the male viewers addict to this drama series, they had to ask so many female actors to show their naked flesh, or shall i say, their white meat? were those endless love-making scenes, those adulterous affairs really necessary? if compare this 'mad men' drama series with the more recent 'suits', this series would suddenly become such a pale, shallow,lukewarm, hollow and even a dead-beat. I gave the series a (probably too high) "7", because I like the atmospherics and alienation. Anything to get away from cookie-cutter crime and corpse dramas! Funny how the reviews at the beginning of the series are highly enthusiastic, and as the season progressed, because highly contemptuous.<br/><br/>I think the truth lies somewhere in between. I read an interesting critique of the show that made the point that the world of Madison Ave. after Kennedy got elected, with a new freshness, youth, and vigor "infecting" the culture, was much more go-go, high-energy, and optimistic that the dour alienated gloom that hangs over the series. I get that the production wants to emphasize the alienation inside the people, but as someone who was 10 at the time, I have an strong intuition that that alienation was not reflected in external atmospherics.<br/><br/>The kind of (literal) free-fall that is so superficially appealing in the title sequence seems to express what was happening in the LATE sixties, early seventies, when post-modernism (including in the form of the counterculture) was injecting multiple perspectives and even aperspectivism into the culture, making "straight" modernists dizzy, and shifting the ground beneath them. But in 1960, modernism was in full flower, and the kind of vertigo suggested in the title sequence and in the series as a whole seems 10 years too early.<br/><br/>I'll give John Hamm the benefit of the doubt until I've seen him work in other projects. Just finished Mad Men on Netflix. The writing is truly spectacular, and I especially recommend turning on subtitles to get the faster-paced, witty humors of the show. I love how the show portrays the era so that the viewer can really put themselves into the characters shoes. And, without giving anything away.of all the shows I've seen on television this has got to be one of the best endings. The actors are great but it's just boring. Affair after affair etc and not much else going on. Having grown up in the 1960s, I quickly became a big Mad Men fan as the characters reminded me of my parents and their friends. From an historical aspect, many bittersweet memories were aroused as the Madison Avenue advertising agency dealt with the Nixon vs. Kennedy election, the Cuban Missile Crisis and Dealy Plaza assassination, in addition to the drama and crises in their own personal lives. I was dismayed when the series took a long sabbatical after three seasons. Unfortunately, the extra long wait for what was advertised as the "last season" was hardly worth it.The reviewer who characterized episodes as "gut wrenching"must get apoplectic watching grass grow. While there were a few good scenes among the myriad of plots, subplots and sub- subplots, as a whole, Season 4 was a jumbled mess and rehashing of earlier scripts. As a member of the minuscule fan base of this series, I can only hope that the show's producers allow it to rest in peace, and allow us to remember Don Draper as the most successful heavy smoking, drinking, skirt-chasing, non-working hero that we have ever known. Is this an award winning series? Yes, and its great if you value something different, and enjoy the texture of 1960's sets. But the story lines are sometimes plodding. The characters have remarkably little development. In many ways the drama seems mechanical and amateurish, the actors capable of greatness. So, how to fix it? (And yes we know its won awards. Do you understand why?) Should we focus on basic storytelling? Should there be less cross-cutting? Should most characters in an episode have lines even if it slows the story? Let's drill down on one theme per story and elevate the project. Let's have real conflicts,rather than missed opportunities at conflicts over issues other than hurt feelings from Draper's soon to be ex-lovers. (He doesn't seem to get romance, and his skirt chasing is threadbare by now.) The strongest story is at the office, but that could be improved if there were more conflicts there as well. Its an odd, somewhat comical cast of characters. Pete's presentation is so stilted that its funny.<br/><br/>Even this we could take, but what about the pacing? Its glacial. Speed up the dialog. Literally. If the exchanges were only more rapid-fire it might be interesting. Use cigarettes and alcohol carefully so as to not slow things down. Every time Draper turns and pours himself a drink we.yawn. Every time he pauses, takes a long drag and answers a non critical question its a distraction. He should be doing something else WHILE he is doing that. Yes, I know we see that sometimes, but we need more of it.<br/><br/>Of course I'm just an amateur, so its only my two cents. It just seems like it could be so much better . . . Keeping it succinct, this show is obviously well made in way of writing, production design, acting, and cinematography, but why should I care about 1960s advertising? It's really that simple and as a viewer, I don't need to explain anything more. I'm supposed to invest about 80-90 hours of my life into something I have absolutely no interest in?<br/><br/>Sure, it looks nice, the actors seem on point, and the writing is obviously well done, but I just don't care about the idea, or concept. I have no interest, and it creates its story with character clichés and cliched conversations that are still good but I've seen before. I think this is a show for die-hard TV show fans. I'm a movie fan, not a tv show fan, so for a show to grab me, I have to "want" to invest 80-90 hours of my life into it, and this is another one that just doesn't do it. I have too many other things to do that I enjoy than to spend forcing myself to watch something because the critics said so, even though when I watch it, it has no appeal based on its topics.<br/><br/>For example, okay in 1960 as seen in the pilot episode, cigarettes were still unstudied on their deleterious nature, and there was a newfound push by doctors and scientists to begin to alert the public as to their side effects, which thus caused a dilemma in the advertising industry. Okayyyy, so is that supposed to impress me? It's slightly interesting, but I'm sure if I wanted to know that, I would easily be able to figure that out based on common sense. It's just not riveting or intriguing. First, I like the show a lot. It's creative, interesting, some great action but every time January Jones' character comes on the screen, I think shaving my testicles with a butter knife would be more enjoyable. <br/><br/>She's a miserable character, her expressions rarely change, she's uninteresting and even with a bleeding testicle, I would still prefer that over watching her in this show. Character mother's like hers are the reason why character children commit suicide. The other characters are interesting, have good story lines. I'm surprised the finale wasn't just a room of dead people having died of smoke-induced cancer or alcoholism. The smoking and the drink was a tad overdone (sarcasm). Spanning the 60s through the warped lens of the boozy world of advertising, Mad Men plays like a soap with quality production values and acting. Our lead character Don, well played by Jon Hamm, lives in some sort of alternate reality or high class porno where at every bar, restaurant, hotel, office, school and every 5 feet, there is a stunning beauty ready to bed. His exploits can get a bit tiresome and contrived, especially since Don is a pretty vacuous and shallow character not helped by writing where locking eyes with a female leads almost immediately to sex. How this man doesn't suffer from syphilic rot and every STD on the planet, is never addressed. <br/><br/>The supporting cast of characters liven up this material and the casting of John Slattery as Roger Sterling is an inspired choice. He can rescue any scene or line of dialogue with his witty performance and line readings. Don's childlike wife played by January Jones is a grating character that the producers and writers seemed to have tossed a bone to the audience by punishing Betty with temporarily making her fat in later seasons. <br/><br/>Mad Men is a mixed bag that's easy enough to want to continue to watch, but there's many narrative detours that just don't work and the show can be frustrating. It works best when it's playful and darkly comic, such as the inspired episode involving a crazed secretary on a lawnmower in the office, who accidentally chops off someone's foot. But far too often the business of advertising takes a backseat to the soapy affairs of its characters. Mad Men, and its 21st Century drenched characters, is about as relevant to the 1960s as The Sopranos was to the real Mafia. But, that does not mean Mad Men is not compelling, and often excellent, television and fiction. It's simply not high art- although one might argue that its memorable opening credit sequence and lyricless musical score, by David Carbonara, are. Nonetheless, its consistent quality, in artistic and technical merits, makes Mad Men one of the best television shows of this century. And, given the narcissistic, deliterate, and self-absorbed state of this reality television era, that is no small compliment. Mad Men is a series like no other. It has mystery, nostalgia, suspense, fine acting, interesting character relationships, great set decor and most of all terrific dialogue.<br/><br/>Don Draper is such a fantastic main character and Jon Hamm really portrays the role brilliantly.<br/><br/>I didn't know about the series when I wrote my novel The Wake-Up Call (thewakeupcallbook.com) who also deals with a Creative Director who's part asshole, part mystery, but now I can certainly see the similarities, although the novel is contemporary and Mad Men is set in the 50s.<br/><br/>I can't think of many who would dislike this brilliant series, a must watch. Especially if you're into advertising or has an affinity for assholes like Pat Bateman in American Psycho. There have been a few people who have told me how great this series is. I finally relented and have watch the first four episodes because I don't like to watch a series that I HAVE to watch the first episode to know what the hell is going on throughout the entire series. There are a few acceptions that I have and do make. This series WILL NOT be one of them. OMG! I can't get emotionally attached to ANY of the characters. That is not good writing. They are all just walking through each episode like they are dead. I will mention that the creators must have watched Billy Wilder's 1960 "The Apartment" which is one of the best films made, IMO, for the idea of office executives cheating on their wives and the unfortunate women that it happened to. You feel for the Shirley MacLaine and Jack Lemmon characters and that's a 2 hour film. But,"Mad Men". I've watched four hours of it and don't feel a thing. Bad show. Let's not forget the Darrin Stephens, of "Bewitched" fame, was one of the actual "Man Men" that was really in the 1960's. I'd rather watch reruns of that show. I have only just seen the Pilot (first two episodes of Season 1), but I am already totally hooked! It's been a very long time since I have faithfully followed and was so hooked on a television-series. The interiors and the clothes remind me so much of my early childhood, it brings back a lot of sense-memories; The pencil skirts, the pointy bra's under figure-hugging cashmere twin-sets, the hair done up in a Grace Kelly-roll and if I watch the series I even smell that time again. The series is perfect in every way! It doesn't only just look great, it's extremely well written too! All that turmoil and evilness going on underneath those lives in the fast lane and well groomed appearances. You just love to hate those slick, sexist, manipulative men and feel for those poor women trapped in impossible situations. It gives a pretty accurate impression of people working in the ad-business. Even today, it takes a certain kind of personality to enjoy thinking of tricks to mislead people and work them over to buy stuff nobody really needs or is bad for them and for the world we live in. You have to be sort of a stoic and 'not give a damn' about the consequences of your actions. They love the game of bringing in the big bucks and sleep fine at night despite their sometimes immoral strategies. That is also why a lot of those ad-men have no problem with lying to and cheating on their spouses, as is portrayed in this series. While in the real world you wouldn't want to be caught dead with snakes like that, their wicked ways are now put to use for great entertainment not in the least thanks to some great acting, particularly from Jon Hamm, who is brilliant in his portrayal of handsome, heartthrob Don Draper (if you see what a certain way of carrying yourself - a subtle look, a particular glance - can bring to a role, Jon Hamm's transformation from his real-life Mr. Nice Guy-Next Door to dashing, intense Don Draper/Richard "Dick" Whitman, is one fine example of first-class acting!). And all set in the most fabulous decors and stylish clothes. I predict a huge early 60's fashion retro-trend due to the success of this series! We already had the comeback of 50's/60's Scandinavian furniture and now we'll most likely soon see the clothes to go with it. And thank God, curves are back! What a great role model for young girls obsessed with becoming stick-thin! And what a coincidence: A few years ago Dutch photographer Erwin Olaf made a magnificent photo-series called 'Grief', which catches exáctly the Mad Men-mood. I immediately felt drawn to it. It's like some women from the series modeled for those photo-shoots. What a treat 'Mad Men' is! I hope they will immediately continue with Season 2 this Fall. I could buy the DVD-box, but I will suppress that urge, because there is also something masochistically special about looking forward to next week's episode. MAD MEN is an offensive piece of work. Imagine the characters on VH1's, 'Tool Academy' brainstorming and hustling for sex and money at a Madison Avenue advertising agency fifty years ago. The series boasts a plethora of stylized sets, incessant smoking and drinking, and the most backward thinking this side of a gorilla cage. And, there-in lies the charm. This wry narrative forces you to explore the world of 1960 USA without the social and political correctness of 21st century America. Civil Rights hadn't reached the dream stage, and White Men in suits called the shots with God given authority, and ladies(girls) knew their place. This series is certainly not for everyone, but if you might enjoy an ironic and faintly amusing look at the ass-end of Eisenhower's America, this could be the series for you. I'm into the third season via rented discs. One long sequence of non sequiturs, misappropriated scenes, gaffes, gauche behaviors... not one character to identify with or interesting to watch. A main character that can't stop his self-destructive relationships, a wife who can't say no to any request no matter how inappropriate and a mother who probably doesn't love her children, a young naive career woman who rises like cream regardless of her stupidity.<br/><br/>I cannot fully express my disgust with this series. Just flush it. It goes nowhere and exemplifies nothing positive in humanity. If the Cuban missile crisis had resulted in the destruction of such a society, we would have to say: good riddance. Goodness, I'm so allergic to this series it keeps me up at night.<br/><br/>To begin with, most characters are plain flat or extremely irritating and remain so throughout all 7 seasons. I'm not much of a fan of the acting either. Christina Hendricks does a swell job and that's about it.<br/><br/>What about the storyline, then? I don't know why I force myself to continue watching but it's truly painful. To see these women throw themselves in front of Don each and every single time. The 60's, you say? I don't believe it. Women are either depicted as seemingly independent and strong, to then undo that image in the most ridiculous way. Or plain sheepish with no backbone at all. That's not the 60's, that's the writer's misogynist view seeping through. And is there any other storyline aside from Don's, frantically looking for his next hot meal?<br/><br/>Then there's the children. You don't feel any sympathy for them at all. Sally for one, is arrogant and mean from the very start. And she's not even a teenager. She comes from a broken family, yes, but such behaviour hardly stems from such an upbringing. Especially in the 60's!
Not to mention the psycho neighbour boy who gives me the creeps every time he appears on screen, yet nobody else really seems to notice. Sally's violin playing friend is another pretentious brat, who speaks freely withtout being put in place properly. Did any of the writers ever study a child behaviour before? It doesn't really seem like it.<br/><br/>I could go on about how horribly bad the flashbacks are and how very poor the dialogue is, but my allergy is getting the better of me. In one phrase: "It's not mad, it's plain bad!" Sometimes I'm just a gushing fan. Spoiler warning. If you haven't seen this, stop reading.<br/><br/>MAD MEN<br/><br/>Indulge me.<br/><br/>The creators presented years of flawless period episodes that gave us an eagle eye view of American culture by using the perspective of the movers and shakers of the advertising world. On the other hand, even if the show hadn't been consistently genius, even if the creators were just whistling Dixie out their a—holes for the past seven years— As a stand alone example of screen writing, the series finale last night was one of the most profound, hard hitting, deftly subtle examples of pop philosophy I have ever seen. Dang these people can write. And dang that cast can act.<br/><br/>From the confusion of WTF is Draper doing? To- and this floored me- the guy and his "refrigerator dream," Draper's reaction- and then the lotus seated Draper fades as the most ground breaking ad in the history of television advertising brings us to a close. Wow. Wow. Wow.<br/><br/>Yeah, I got punk'd a little this season. I got sucked in. I got pi**ed off. What the hell was our protagonist doing? Who are these last minute characters? Why are they there? Amazing again. A great writer shows, they don't tell. And they showed our Don facing and seeking himself. Having himself being thrown upon himself by having dysfunctional new characters and situations being attracted to him. Each one not wanting to get out of his or her trap and ultimately pushing him away. Why? Because he was healing himself and unlike them, was about to get out of his own trap.<br/><br/>And the best thing— that is how the story started. Simple. A man against insane circumstances with a will to surpass them. Not for one second did the writers deviate from that theme. Plus they expanded on it by allowing us to see the macrocosm of that theme- Don and his journey or self discovery paralleled by America and her journey of self discovery.<br/><br/>I will binge watch this series again and again. I wouldn't be surprised if it becomes a University course.<br/><br/>And I do have something to look forward to: Netflix's Grace and Frankie. I first started to watch Mad Men when it was in its fifth season or so. I gave up in the second or third season because I didn't find it particularly interesting or engaging. Now that the entire series is on Netflix I decided to try again and watch the whole thing no matter what. My initial take on the show hasn't changed.<br/><br/>Having worked on several, I recognize a soap when I see one. People are so dazzled by the show being set in the 60's and the effects it has on set design, costume and hairstyle. And the setting is fun, with people smoking everywhere and office workers drinking like sailors on shore leave. But once the novelty wears off, the storylines are straight out of soap operas and the only thing more flat than the characters is the dialogue. And despite the show's attempt to be racy with its many, many sex scenes, in the end it's very chaste since it's on basic cable. Not a female nipple in sight, with blankets being pulled up to the armpits one split second post coitus and one swear word per show or season. Clutch the pearls and get the smelling salts.<br/><br/>The show is obsessed with Jews for obvious reasons, but it gets pretty old after a while. What else have you got? For a show trying so hard to be progressive, I find it somewhat amusing that the only religious and ethnic minorities which Hollywood (not only this show) deems worthy of attention are Jews and blacks. Perhaps it's because of the era the show is set in, but most likely not.<br/><br/>Don Draper has got to be one of the least interesting main characters in television. Having other characters commenting on how mysterious he is doesn't make him an interesting character. Forget for a minute how dashing Jon Hamm is playing him: Aside from screwing every woman who enters his field of vision and being afraid of his (not so terribly engaging) secret to come out, what does Don Draper want? After watching 92 episodes I still can't answer this basic question.<br/><br/>Evident from the plot point about his contract, it's clear he doesn't want to be tied down. So why did he choose to get married? And twice at that. In fact, why does he choose to work in advertising? He seems to enjoy neither his work nor his marriage(s). He just sort of trundles along sticking his weiner into any woman who happens to cross his path. I don't think there's anything wrong with Hamm's portrayal. It's just that he's given very little to work with. One character says the following to Don in the last season: "You don't have any character, you're just handsome!". I'm sure it was meant as a tongue in cheek joke by Weiner et al, but it accidentally summed up Don Draper to me. He's meaningless.<br/><br/>But singling out Don is unfair, most of the characters are one note. The acting is for the most part serviceable, with some notable exceptions. Vincent Kartheiser playing Pete is one example. It's not that I don't like the character, it's just that not a single moment (especially in the latter seasons) rings true.<br/><br/>But the prime example has got to be January Jones as Betty. I'm sorry to be piling on, because she has already gotten a lot of flak, but this is possibly the stiffest acting I have seen in a high budget project. She certainly looks the part, being a dead ringer for Grace Kelly, but every single line reading comes off as her reading from the phone book. But wait, it gets worse. In a move of blatant nepotism Matthew Weiner's son is cast as Glen, a boy with a dead-eyed thousand yard stare and all the likeability and charm of a serial rapist who crosses paths with the Draper household. The scenes he shares with Betty (of which there are many) are nothing but torture. One got cast because of her looks, the other because of his DNA, and neither one could act their way out of a paper bag. It took Mrs. Shullivan and I approximately ten (10) days over successive weekends to binge watch the entire seven (7) seasons of Mad Men which we had heard and especially read so much about this series unique originality and great casting. Well the casting for the most part was accurate. Jon Hamm, Elisabeth Moss, Bryan Batt, Alison Brie, and Vincent Kartheiser were true to their characters and most enjoyable. The two characters who I especially enjoyed though were actor John Slattery who plays Roger Sterling, a second generation corporate partner in the ad agency and his Secretarial ManagerJoan Harris (Christina Hendricks). Slattery's character Roger Sterling, as the so-called schmoozer and people person who knows how to (especially) wine and dine his agencies clients and not worry so much about the agencies business itself was always enjoyable whenever he was granted screen time. Hendricks' character grew over each season and although Mrs. Shullivan and I were disappointed on the way she eventually became an agency partner, we felt her partnership was still long overdue, and the large amount of screen time provided to her was proof she deserved every minute of it.<br/><br/>As with most multiple season(s) winning Emmy TV series it takes at least a dozen or so episodes before the characters true personalities and idiosyncrasies are revealed to their audience. You may have noticed that I did not reference actress January Jones, Jessica Paré, and/or Rich Sommer as characters Mrs. Shullivan and I enjoyed because we did not enjoy them. The one character who was totally miscast though was the Draper's next door neighbor's son Glen Bishop played with zero "0" personality by actor Marten Holden Weiner. This just goes to prove that nepotism has no place in a successful Emmy winning TV series especially if your father Matthew Weiner is the series creator. I would have dreaded being either January Jones and/or Kiernan Shipka who were the two actresses who were forced by the series scripts to share air time with this overly stiff and plastic personality of Glen Bishop. Whenever this zombie Glen Bishop was granted screen time with Betty Draper/Francis, and/or Sally Draper Mrs. Shullivan and I looked at each other with disdain for the series creator Matthew Weiner for wasting our time. I was forced to drop my overall IMDB series rating down a notch as a result from an 8 to a 7 out of 10 rating.<br/><br/>There was a missed opportunity by the series set decorators in taking advantage of the time period, the 1960's, in creating some elaborate sets such as in restaurant taverns and go-go discotechs, and plying us intermittently with reminiscent songs of the era not just in the closing credits of each series episode.<br/><br/>In summary the series Mad Men was decent, more hype than happening, but it certainly pales in comparison to my four (4) other longstanding TV series that being, The Wire (2002-2008), Dexter (2006-2013), Gunsmoke (1955-1975), and of course Bonanza (1959-1973). Mad Men is an excellent show for television. The characters are interesting, the drama is impeccable, and the comedy is clever. This show is a drama, but it has some (very) funny moments! <br/><br/>The show is set in the 1960's in New York City, at an advertising agency on Madison Avenue. The series starts with Donald Draper, who's the protagonist, living under a secret identity. His real name is Richard 'Dick' Whitman and he's actually a war veteran. He was married to Betty Draper, who is beautiful but cold-hearted. She's the show's antagonist. She's rude, sadistic, and acts like she hates everyone. They have two beautiful children named Bobby and Sally. By the end of season 3, however, Don and Betty run into problems when she discovers who he REALLY is. She divorces him and he marries Megan Draper, his beautiful, Canadian (from Montreal), and cheerful secretary, who's much prettier than Betty! The place that Don works is called Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce (formerly just Sterling Cooper), where he is one of the managers and is respected just as much as he's feared. Other people who work at the company include Joan Harris, Margaret 'Peggy' Olsen, Peter Campbell, Roger Sterling, and many others. Joan is sarcastic and girly but vastly intelligent, sometimes using her intellect to blackmail other workers, usually Peggy. Roger is a wise- cracking jerk, and Peter is the cynical younger version of Roger! Peggy is by far the friendliest one at the company, and the most loyal. They all have very clever dialogue which goes perfectly with what they do. <br/><br/>Season 1 was flawless, and everything after that became far more interesting. This show is very mature and very hard-hitting, with many surprises. This is a show you CANNOT miss! 10 stars for me definitely. So although I finished watching the season finale asking myself if anything happened during the past 13 episodes, when you take a deeper look at what actually went down in season five and even this final installment of 2012, it was pretty hefty.<br/><br/>Like I said, there were a lot of interesting stories told about our favorite Mad Men characters. It just didn't seem to add up to much. The company's doing much better now, and the new office space will prove that to everyone soon enough, but that felt like a less than earth shattering event. In comparison to season finales of the past, it felt slight.<br/><br/>There can't be much more Mad Men left in our lives, so we best just enjoy it while we have it. "The Phantom" was a pleasant conclusion to a fine season. What did you all think of it? Did it satisfy your needs, or did it disappoint as a finale? And will somebody please put some pants on Roger Sterling! Watch mad men www.WatchMadMenOnline.com Watch mad men www.WatchMadMenOnline.com Watch mad men www.WatchMadMenOnline.com Watch mad men www.WatchMadMenOnline.com I think this show somehow has become a way to make Americans better. While watching this show and seeing them destroy their lives with all the drinking, smoking, cheating on each other...etc. its like a "what not to do" documentary. This is where we came from, don't go back!! caution signs everywhere. If you every have the urge to smoke or drink or be unfaithful, just watch an episode and it will destroy your appetite to do so. The characters do it enough for you and everyone else<br/><br/>Don is definitely not on the top of the list of favorite characters on the show. Although he gets the most screen time he seems kind of flat. The back story helps but the only time that comes into play is when he screws up his face at the camera and that is the directors way of telling us he is remembering something and being deep. Basically he is a womanizer with a drinking problem.<br/><br/>Peggy and Peter I think take the show. Peggy clearly because you don't see her in the same setting twice. Every season her extra-work curriculum is different. Peter needs to make a name for himself (actually to live up to the name he has.) At first you just hate the weasel kid but through out the seasons he has become someone I root for and not just because he whined about everything. He has made some daring moves (If scripted can be daring) and is doing OK to hold his own.<br/><br/>I give this show a 7 because I think it is a great view of this time period in our country. It shows family life, business culture, counter culture, historic events, and how our country reacted to those historic events. I couldnt end up watching more than 3 episodes, it was so boring, and the characters were SO SO SO SO CLICHÉ AND PREDICTABLE!!!!! Like, come on!! the writters have to think a little bit and develop and bring new stuff, I've seen this kind of show millions of times before, the same boring plot, the same predictable drama, the same predictable characters with different names and actors, but same old story, any smart person would give this show a 1/10, no place to discussion, PERIOD. A ruthless Quick witted badass salesman who has a lust for power in a big Advertisement agency in 1960s which have a competitive smart employees.<br/><br/>This title alone. Made me watch the show.
The show is interesting. its nice. Its deep. Liked the gang and the lead. He is truly a badass character.
But I watched 3 seasons and honestly I think I'm done with it.<br/><br/>before anyone start cursing at me. My reason are below. And don't worry I'm not gonna miss anything out in the show I know probably 60% of any show before i watch it. I spoil films/shows for my self. To not be disappointed and waste time.<br/><br/>I dropped the show cuz:<br/><br/><ul><li>it's extremely extremely boring.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>A lot of infidelity. Which Im extremely against. I can't believe for a second that everyone in the 1960s cheats on everyone. what kind of show is this. Also don is not with his family most of the time and he got divorced then married someone else then got divorced. Hes like a child.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Nearly everyone have a personal issue that's so deep within them. especially the lead character which is Don Draper which is the reason I watched the show. As I previously mentioned in the title. he is a badass character which I wanted but he has many many problems.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>I was extremely bothered when a woman sadly realized that her husband is a homosexual. the idea of it makes me sick. Why put a woman through that?. The way that she discovered bothered mostly. The man didn't satisfy his wife for months. And when she asked him while shes in a sexy dress and he just said something stupid and danced. Come on man.</li></ul> I am in love with mad men ... everything about it is good..the best thing i like about it is the show tells story in more visual way The depht in the plot has it's own trademark, the acting... what not. I like it. Nothing to extra to say, that hasn't been said already.<br/><br/>What I can not take my mind of is the treatment women had to endure on their every day interactions. The reduced scenery of the world they had no choice but to live within. The repression. The cultural submission. It hurts. Badly.<br/><br/>While watching a series, I generally empathize deeply with all sorts of caracters: men and women, good, bad, dumb, mean, heroes, those with Bad luck, children, etc. This time all of my attention goes, not directly to women caracters, but to the way they are treated and how they react. And it hurts every time.<br/><br/>It helps me understand my grand mothers, their sisters, and my mom. What an awful repression. I fear the day women (I) loose the liberties that little by little have been attained. And these liberties are not pending from the strongest thread. I admit I enjoyed this series mainly due to the strong excellent cast, whom you get to know and either love or hate the role they play but love them for it based around an advertising agency but built around the individual relationships.
The character Don Draper is a hypocritical selfish somewhat chauvinistic giggalo and a creative genius in advertising , Roger Sterling also a playboy although boy suggests youth and he is more mid life but a great sense of humour with some cracking one liners .they are just 2 of the partners of the ad agency.
I am on the 6 th series and all the characters are well developed the story as in series development not so much it is good but could have been a lot better. Have completed the whole series now and the last episode held no surprises as when a show does not develop story wise it makes ending it so much easier as anything will suffice and that is exactly what transpired. I love all the recent reviews talking about all the obvious context of this show. What were you expecting? It is a show based in a misogynistic period in our history, not just a exploit of that time but a story that confronts issues and taboos as well. So many reviews talk about how they could not even finish the first episode... then what are you doing reviewing a show, there are 93 episodes! That's put beside.
The show has a dynamic leading character and also does an amazing job detailing the troubled history of the quote in quote modern times. The writing, the acting , the filmography is all on point. I have watched this series multiple times. If you are in it for the long hall then you will also be surprised with the final outcome. Bless this show and all the uninformed haters. Watch a show; then review! Period. I just wish they could revive Mad Men, somehow. Just get a whole new cast. Maybe, even start anew, rather than continue...or new generation taking over with references to past and maybe even cameo appearances.. Whatever, Just DO IT! Bring it back!! It was so authentic for the period of the 60's. Please!! Mad Men 2 or Madder Men. Or even Mad Women! That would be tricky, since women were still mommies or secretaries. Mad Men is probably the most accurate representation of that iconic decade called the 60's. The story gets boring and repetitive with the pass of the season (the first 3 were impecable) although Matthew Weiner somehow catch my attention were the finale was very close. Jon Hamm, Christina Hendricks and John Slatery develope their characters in the best way, not to mention we can see the acting evolution of the talented Kiernan Shipka. I would say Mad Men story is not the best thing on tv, however the 60's are really well portrayed with the inclusion of music, historic events, traditions, lifestyles and places that made that part of history so interesting. I recommend it but if somehow you don't make through the final of the show, I wouldn't blame you for it. Spoiler free, but context filled.<br/><br/>Mad Men has a special place in my heart for a number of reasons. One, I'm a sucker for nostalgia which plays a huge role in both era and the main characters, especially Don Draper. I can say without a shadow of a doubt that I relate more to Don Draper, than I ever have another character in cinematic history. He is an often reckless child who appears as a smooth and creative sales juggernaut that far too often finds himself in a daze, and is seemingly never satisfied. Two, I moved to Texas by myself after leaving home for my first big job and my brother handed me the DVD box for Seasons 1-4 and said watch this show, it will help you get through going home every day. It sure did, but in the process I fell in love with the dialogue, characters, and presentation which is often glamorous but also gritty under the surface. The Ad men drink and get what they want but often pay a price in one way or another. Mad Men, to me, is more of a look at how doing what you're supposed to isn't all there is. Satisfaction isn't just from a family, dollars, or pretending everything is okay. Your past comes with you, damage is a real principle that can't be fixed internally, even if it looks good cosmetically. The show is a very slow burn. The first four seasons are very good and leave you wanted more, the last few are more like life- it's less fun because it's rehashing mergers, sadness, and leading to an evolution of discovery. It still has its moments, nostalgia, and some new built in, but the entire point is that Don keeps repeating his mistakes. <br/><br/>The other characters come and go as the years pass, cultural events occur, and history is written within their lives work and relations. Performances by a fresh off of West Wing Elisabeth Moss, with huge parts by John Slattery, Vincent Kartheiser, Alison Brie, Christina Hendricks, and January Jones highlight a brothel of complimentary pieces to Draper's plight. Don finally realizes that all he has been searching for isn't in someone else's eyes, fatherhood, or bigger and bigger mergers. It's in him, no matter what he calls himself. What made all those things work when they did, and what made his agencies so successful what the same ingredient- he is a brilliant creator. He's just not a great maintainer. Mad Men is worth every second, watch and enjoy. I went to bed Sunday night feeling great! For once, there was a logical , (for me nostalgic), sentimental and warm ending. Burts departure blew me away! How the writers came up with giving the old song and dance man his soft shoe exit was brilliant and deserves an award. Anyone that isn't familiar with Robert Morse's work, I strongly suggest you go to "YouTube" and see him in "How to Succeed in Business". <br/><br/>I was also happy to get an explanation why Joan was a turncoat. It makes you realize the problems Don caused and if you work there you can't be as forgiving as the viewer.<br/><br/>I dread Mondays, so heading into dreamland with happy thoughts, is a good feeling. Thanks Mad Men!! If you will look to the rating section, you will see I gave this show a 10/10, I usually only give an 8 or 9 out of ten, but this show deserves every last star!<br/><br/>In 1960's New York, ad agency Sterling Cooper is on a shoe string, both with their clients, and both with their employees. The show chronicles their successes and failures, at the same time, the lives of their employees on a roller-coaster going up and down, as their families and their personal lives begin to start crash.<br/><br/>This show is amazing! I mean it! It is well written and well acted! The way this show is executed amazing. The show is so well done! The episode can zig when you think it will zag, and zag when you want it to zig! Of all of the actors, if you told if I had to chose only one actor as my favorite, and if I didn't, you would force me to listen to modern rock, which I hate, play on! I couldn't do it! The best I can name are John Slatery and Jon Hamm, who never cease to impress! You can watch it on Netflix, and hurry, the next season starts this April!<br/><br/>This so addicting! Ounce you watch it, you can't quit it!<br/><br/>Out of 10 film rolls, how I've began rating TV shows, a 10, no questions about it! With only three episodes left, this season is obviously "in the can," but I hope that next year is more than the Betty and Don show. Honestly, the camera is on them so much that they've stopped being interesting. Use the rest of your cast, don't spend so much time in one place. It feels like killing time now - just because John Hamm is handsome doesn't mean that you can simply put the camera on him and wait. It's interesting when he's in the office, talking to the other ad people. The maundering emotional stuff at home is getting old. And you are under-utilizing so many interesting characters. Give us Peggy and Joan's stories - they've all but disappeared under the ponderous weight of following Betty and Don around. More story line and less filler, please! I kept forgetting to look this up. I caught it while at a friends house one night when dropping him off.. and having coffee.. we watched it not having a clue what it was.. and after it finished I was none the wiser. We are both film/TV buffs.. and I thought apart from it looking slightly period, glossy, just didn't fall into it at all!! WHY Mad Men... now I'm thinking.. OK.. Advertising Men.. Mad as in Madison Avenue... now thanks to this site I now have an idea. Strange. I'm usually very good at picking things up. I have patience. My mate doesn't. So its early 60's.. well, that stacked up. Thank you people. This site is very useful for all TV/film info. I was alive then. Most of the cast here were not, except R. Morse who made a career back then about portraying business in America - and the shallowness of its stereotypes.<br/><br/>I see lots of alcoholism, sexism, racism and tons of smoking. In addition, there is lots of backstabbing. Lying and heartbreak are constant.<br/><br/>The 1960-1969 period had Eisenhower, Elvis, cold war, folksingers, British music invasion, hippies, etc. The Madison Avenue world was insular and separate from the outside. Outside, there were also race riots. World War II movies were still being made.<br/><br/>I wondered what all the fuss was about. I had liked 'Playboy Club' and 'Pan Am' for their 1960s-era music and events portrayals, yet I kept hearing that they were outgrowths of 'Mad Men'. Truthfully, upon finally watching 'Mad Men' I find it boring and colorless. Its characters are mean and shallow, and well they are supposed to be.<br/><br/>5/10 Only took a few episodes, and I'd seen enough. It's like L.A. Law office culture revisited in fake 1960's American business culture where the producers aim to draw a picture of every person's fantasy. It's really a romance novel, with wealthy eye candy for the women viewers, scantily clad shapely secretaries for the men, in a world where money and sex are everything, but at least it ultimately concludes by showing how miserable everyone is. It's extremely deceptive in its depiction of showing all persons as rude, crude, politically incorrect and with absolutely no self control of their language, much less their hormones. The women are portrayed as feminists who are justified to cheat on their mates, the men portrayed as money grubbing bigots who voted for Goldwater. Nothing new or surprising here. The '60s wardrobes and cars (the cars are more 1950s and are out of place in a well-to-do 1968 suburbia) are novel if a little too cliché, the references to the products of yesteryear are a nice touch, but not enough to save this schlock soap opera unless you really have no life and nothing else to do or watch. There is a lot of television out there today, with allegedly bingeworthy series proliferating like rabbits thanks to HBO, Showtime, Amazon Prime and, of course, Netflix. I have really enjoyed a few of these creations: The Wire, Boardwalk Empire, House of Cards; to a lesser extent Breaking Bad and the Sopranos. Others I stopped watching because they seemed so flawed that it was not worth my time to continue.<br/><br/>I do like to give acclaimed series a fair chance, and so although I found myself at the end of every episode of season 1 of Mad Men asking whether I should continue on (which was already a bad sign), by the end I had realized that it is really not worth watching. I dislike all of the characters, and find that each episode simply rehashes the same 100 word description of each character. This one is a bimbo; that one is a scumbag; this one thinks he´s smart; that one is meek. All of them are alcoholics and chain smokers. Okay, this was the Madison Avenue advertising office scene in 1960. Got it.<br/><br/>The lead protagonist, who sleeps with an array of women toward which he expresses exactly the same sentiments and with the same degree of apparent sincerity, is completely unappealing, but so is his pathetic wife. His secretary, Peggy, wants to be a strong feminist, upwardly mobile, independent woman, but I lost all ability to take her seriously at the end of the season when she gave birth to a child, having failed to realize that she was pregnant. How is that even possible? She did not have a period for nine months and then was surprised when her stomach ache was actually labor pains? Enough. Time to move on.<br/><br/>I also found mildly annoying that the intro of each episode rips off the opening sequence of a British series about con artists. The cut-out black and white figure falling is complete and unmitigated plagiarism. They seem even to be using similar music! No idea how the creative team got away with that. I don't like the show. The men & women are mean, childish & depressing aka not likable. Everybody cheats on their spouses & they are ruthless. There are two things I do like about this show: The only two characters I have little interest is are Sally & Lane. I like the 60's fashion. It's more of your afternoon soap opera. If you're tired of endless cop dramas on every network and interested in a one of a kind 1960s perspective drama, Mad Men is a great show. So far I have watched 6 out of the 8 sessions without any disappointment. Mad Men captures the look and culture of the upper class in the 60s. At first characters appear basic but as time goes on viewers learn more about their personal lives and problems. With this stated, viewers can also get attached to characters, so when a drastic change occurs it can be even harder to go along with it. The drastic responses that go along with a change would have been appropriate for that time period making it intriguing and interesting. Characters of Mad Men make decisions very different from what would be expected today, keeping the viewer involved in the series. With this said, many problems we face today are parallel to problems during the sixties. While abortion and equal rights (gay marriage) as defining topics of the twenty-first century abortion and equal rights among African Americans were defining topics of the 1960s. A complex, yet easy to understand plot makes for an interesting series for just about anyone (any adult). As the series progresses plot twists intrigue the viewer without disappointing them. In most shows change often is disappointing although in Mad Men the changes just get better and better. The show is great! I have not enjoyed such good writing and ensemble acting since Sex & the City. There are some episodes that seem to be style over substance, and others where you are so drawn in to the characters lives, you are sharing their emotions with them. Don't be fooled by how easy this seems - this is acting master class 1 on 1. Draper disgusts and attracts you at the same time, while other characters go through the most enormous transformations and life-changing events.<br/><br/>My only gripe, and why this gets a 9 rather than a 10, is that they drop plot lines all the time, boyfriends, girlfriends, old characters just seem to disappear as if they were never really meant to be in the show. But, who am I to grumble.<br/><br/>John Slattery is awesome! It will be very difficult to reconcile watching a great TV show on a weekly basis, waiting 7 days for my 1 hour fix. We have become too impatient and demand instant gratification.<br/><br/>I am at episode 4 of season 5 and I am out of discs for about 3 days! Help, me Dude, I need my SCPB fix, why the hell are they so excited about an airline that is about to go broke! This series has stayed with me but not for good reason. I had heard many rave reviews about Mad Men over the years and had always been slightly intrigued so took a chance on it when it came up on a recommended binge watch list on Netflix. The first episode was stylish and compelling and made you want to invest in finding out the mysteries of Don Draper. The overall feel of the show; the sets, the wardrobe, the atmosphere was also very spot on. I was excited!!!<br/><br/>As the show went on, however it did feel that it was going absolutely nowhere! No continuity at all. It made Seinfold (a show which boasts about being a show about nothing) look like the daily news. I found that there were many plot holes and loose ends in the main plot AND subplots. I kept hoping that everything would tie together but nothing ever did. No character development, no character redemption, all but one or two of the characters were unlikable. Betty Draper was a jarring, whiny shell of a person!!! It was insufferable. I gave it a good go- got midway through season 5- but nothing was going to save this mediocre, melodramatic, overhyped nonsense!<br/><br/>Don Draper (Jon Hamm) is an awful actor and is no leading man. He is ok to look at but lacks the nuances and je ne sais quoi to pull off a character that you should hate but can't help but love and feel sorry for. Grimaces and a constant clueless/strained look on one's face is not acting.<br/><br/>The storytelling is perfunctory and clunky and where the backdrop is so smooth, the awkwardness of the former stands out that much more. It's a shame because this could have been so much better than what it was! I fell asleep when i watched this series several times because that is how boring it was. A surprising American series indeed. And yet it is fascinating. Nostalgia first. 1960 with the duel between Nixon and Kennedy. It is amazing to recapture these old pictures and these old events, and the reactions of some people to the events that were going to become historical if not frankly historic. Nostalgia too with the presence, excessive presence, total submersion if not flood of tobacco smoke in these episodes. I defy you to just feel like following them and chain, double chain, triple chain smoke the way they do. They kiss and smoke at the same time, smoking through their nostrils or their ears I guess. Was there a place where we could not smoke in those days? I don't even remember a non-smoking area, except maybe on trains, one compartment per carriage, when there were compartments. Smoke detectors were not trendy yet. Still nostalgic but in another style and direction with the Korean war, but in a dramatic way: a lieutenant being killed and his identity assumed by the only witness, a simple soldier from nowhere who volunteered in the war to escape his own family he hated completely and utterly. The film is cruel about this episode, and yet the man is a success story on the basis of a college diploma he never passed, but who cares? No one of course. No deserting, no real criminal act, except the exchange of a dog tag with a dead officer. But then the nostalgia is quite tempered by the insight the other questions that are evoked here bring about some further evolution in society. The main and central problem is that of women. These women who were supposed to be beautiful to just find a husband through some work, at times, but not too much, then make two children, a boy and a girl if possible, and take care of the family home without letting any stranger cross the threshold. Those who worked real hard were not envisaging a housewife career but rather a plain career, be it social, economic, artistic or whatever. They were the new postwar generations of women who decided that the housewife fate was not for them, and anyway the economy required them to work and the incomes of workers and the new needs and consuming possibilities required a second income in the home. Here the film is quite clear about the motivations of women, of working women as well as of housewives. They want to have their say in things, their independence in life, the recognition of their personality and identity. The series is cruel though at times, but so true. Cruel with these housewives who are so bored that they waste their time on checking the phone calls of their husbands, and finding out about their affairs, the good old western Christian or Jewish polygamy. Cruel about the women who use their sex appeal or their yielding to the sexual appetite of the men around them just for their vanity and to have some small presents and advantages, like a canary in a cage. Cruel when a woman gets some authority over another woman and over-uses it, abuses it and even abuses the girl or woman she is supposed to take care of. But the worst cruelty is against all the macho phallocratic men who behave with women as if they were servants, subservient, as if they had to be crawling at their feet and obsequiously submissive. The men are odious, purely idiotic, blind but also conscious at times that something was evading and escaping them, that women, married or not, wives or not, Jewish or not, were taking over the territory that was becoming theirs, the family, their desk space, their waste paper basket, their box in the personnel lounge, etc. We just wonder if things were really like that and we have to remember that yes they were and yes they were changing in that direction. The last thing I would like to say on that series, I mean the first season of that series, is that there is a lot of humor nearly everywhere, and at times, quite often indeed, sad humor, but humor all the same like about the Jews who are still ghettoized, or a lesbian woman who is nicely diplomatically negotiated by her room mate, or a gay man who is curtly and coldly pushed back by the closet homo who does not want to admit it. We are still in 1960 and Kennedy has not been elected yet and the real battle about civil rights is just starting in a way, for the Blacks. The Jews are maybe slightly different, but the gay and lesbian people are far from the beginning of the decision to just open the door of the closet one inch to see if there is anyone in there. I must admit it is good to look back, not in anger but in shame and in gratefulness, at times that have changed in this period that was just the very first step towards real freedom in our countries, and we are still far from the fulfillment of Roosevelt's promise about the four freedoms. By the way, what about the freedom from want in the healthcare field of poverty and misery, what about top notch surgery for a coronary accident of a homeless person? Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID I hate it when people write long reviews. So to cut it short I just finished watching all the seasons of Madmen. Just so you know I did not watch the full series cause it was intriguing, but I cannot leave any thing half way if I start something.<br/><br/>Now about the series, the story of the protagonist is dull which makes the series dull. You can never feel pity for him until Season 7. It looks he has a death wish or you can say self destruct. There is no hope in this series, just a continuous similar episodes after episodes. And since the writer was not satisfied with him so he basically darkened all the rest of them. The first three seasons are going to drown you and you feel like you need to kill someone. A little improvement can be seen in season 5 only and I emphasize on the word "ONLY". A few things good in this series is the presentation or cinematography and costumes.<br/><br/>So basic verdict is that the plot is week and makes you feel restless. I genuinely don't know why I love the show. It's slow and full of day-to- day stories from an ad agency (I'm in love with this industry, that's why I started, but I did not expect to really like it). But strangely the charisma of the show is undeniable.<br/><br/>A brilliant choice of cast. Very well written. Music is among the best I've ever seen. And the show is beautiful, so it's enjoyable for the eyes.<br/><br/>The characters are the best in this TV series. Every single character, from the main to the supporting, are unique and memorable. Especially Don Draper, Peggy, Sterling and Pete Campbell, four of my favorite. They are all bipolar, complicated and very interesting.<br/><br/>Well done AMC. Another favorite and superb show for me, besides Breaking Bad. When I first watched this show I really didn't like or appreciate what the were doing. I didn't understand it very well and the entire time I thought there was going to be some sort of TV Action Adventure but there wasn't. So I stopped watching it for a while but then my aunt told me to keep watching it and once you get it, It incredible.<br/><br/>She was right, I believe that this is the hardest show to write for on AMC. When you get the show you realized how powerful the men are in the show because the companies that they talk about are multi-Billion dollar company's today but back in the 60's they were just start up company's and they were responsible for there success.<br/><br/>The Main Character is Don Draper and about his present life and his past life. He doesn't talk much about his past tell later on the series but in the begging his past comes back to him and he was forced to face it and then he starts talking about it. In his present life he this great ad men that can come up with these killer presentation that makes almost every company want to have him set up there advertisement. Mad Men is really nothing short of a prime example of the New Golden Age of Television. We live in a day in age that television is at it's creative high. There has been a huge burst from television channels today to make it there goal to not just bring the viewer an entertaining show, but a show that can deliver some humanity to it and some real substance at that.<br/><br/>The show takes place in the 1960's, a time that most people today would say was a defining time period for the U.S. The show focus' on a Manhattan ad agency, mainly on the mysterious Donald Draper. On the outside Don Draper and his family are nothing short of the smiling family you would find in an old 1960's photo in a suburb. The show not only reveals how immoral these people actually are but it also shows human they are. The show is a masterpiece when it comes to writing, there is never really a moment on the show that makes you feel like these people are happy.<br/><br/>The most interesting aspect of the show for me is the history they show. Everything from the JFK assassination to the Democratic National Convention Riots. There are moments that really show how chaotic the decade was and just how revolutionary it was.<br/><br/>The reason that I call this show Art TV is because of how beautiful the show is. It's never obvious and always interesting. Some people might think it's slow moving or it's too much of a soap opera are missing the point of the show. It's especially impressive because the show is in it's 6th season and it's still incredible. With the final season coming, I would say that it's the perfect time to get caught up on this masterpiece it's last ride into town. Mad Men is easily one of the best shows of all time and arguably the best show ever (Not on HBO). Check it out if you haven't already. I was keen to watch at last this much lauded and decorated TV series, being a lover of admittedly older-generation classic American TV and having besides a keen interest in post-war U.S. society. My conclusion for now is that while there's much to savour, there's almost as much to repel and at times it can be difficult to watch. In terms of its highly stylised production values and physical depiction of the times, it seems very accurate, right down to the office settings and fashion-sense. The acting too is of a high standard, the ensemble playing very strong with no obvious weak-links. The tie- ins with contemporary events, prominently in this series the epochal Nixon-Kennedy election adds flavour and resonance and one wonders how many other significant happenings will be deemed worthy of reference. However what can't be avoided here is the controversial portrayal of the sexes. Women are either "easy-meat" office prey for predatory office males, who invariably have passive, docile, unsuspecting wives back home. Personally I find all the "junior-jumping" quite offensive and overdone, all of which makes it harder to empathise, far less sympathise with any of the characters, even the leads. That said, as the series progresses and we go deeper into the mysterious back-story of main man Don Draper, the troubled psyche of his dutiful wife, the progress of frumpy secretary-cum-copywriter Peggy and the thwarted ambitions of baby-faced wannabe Pete, it gradually comes together, although it did take a lot of rather empty episodes to get to that point. That said, I am now sufficiently intrigued to want to see more and how the characters adapt to the burgeoning 60's, but overall I'd still say and forgive the cliché, that it seems that style is triumphing over content thus far. By episode 7, couldn't find any point. It's a soap opera, nothing more really. Better acting, better writing but still uninteresting at best. The way overdone drinking and smoking thrown in, couldn't possible be accurate and revolting at times... Again what's the point. The point is that people have too much time on their hands, especially if they already binged their way through beauties like Walking Dead and Mad Men. I wonder how long it will be before people start binge watching the last half century / 11,500 episodes of the Young and the Restless.
Last point, a reference to Ayn Rand's novel "Atlas Shrugged" was made in season 1. Like nearly all popular media references to said work, the concepts were twisted and way off-mark. An agenda was revealed, sayonara Mad Men for me. It was interesting to see everyone smoking in elevators and meetings and bed. The way they treated women in the 1950s was way different too. The impact of the war is obvious. Just some interesting stuff. The director does a good job with fashion and cars and taking you back to that time. The led is Don Draper, he has a girlfriend who is a wild-child. The wife and kids and neighbors and friends from work -- all interesting. But in the end, it lost us after a handful of episodes. Just didn't seem to go anywhere. Episode 1 was interesting enough to make me watch episode 2. That's as far as I can get. It's not funny and it seems to be concerned with how hard are the lives of wealthy women of whose lifestyles I can only dream. <br/><br/>Yawn. There is plenty of stress to go around in this television series. Practically everyone is drinking and smoking to their heart's content. These are men caught up in a frenzy of an advertising agency. They would literally cut each other up if given the opportunity to do so.<br/><br/>There are plenty of modern day issues to tackle as we saw this evening when during a fire at a hotel, it's determined that one of the executives is a homosexual.<br/><br/>Everything is supposed to be done nicely and to fit in place. This includes the firing of an executive whose dismissal was held up while his wife underwent radiation treatments. Two people have been promoted to take his place. The fired executive's parting scene was comical. He didn't exactly accept going out quietly.<br/><br/>An interesting show, but where can all this lead to ultimately? I understand why conservative Americans like this show. It's a romanticised account of what the 50s and 60s look like, and that's the entire point. The Baby Boomers would want you to believe that the United States of America was this blissful era where "men where men," and "women were women."<br/><br/>Well, yes, I dare take angander that, that was very much the case. But you the audience need to know that the US of A in the 50s & 60s wasn't all of that. The lives that you see on this show is idealised and fantasized. It is from the very same Baby Boomers who want to secure their Social Security and welfare that is paid by the current Gen Y and Millennial through threat of force by the same government that these Boomers supposedly claim to despise. <br/><br/>Now instead of making you realise what idiots you are for not questioning why you're not getting 100% of your total salary, they lull you into watching Mad Men; a show about how great the Baby Boomer generation were. <br/><br/>In all honesty, this show does portray that, but only if you're too ignorant, or in such a stupor that you don't realise that half the time, this show is boring. <br/><br/>Don Draper, played efficiently by Jon Hamm is an interesting enough character, so is Roger Sterling played by John Slattery as well as Joan Holloway played by Christina Hendricks. Other than these 3, everyone else is tedious to watch.<br/><br/>The best scenes are when Don Draper pitches his advertisement, when he not only describes but shows you how words influence our emotions, how it connects a person by offering a perceived reward, creating a want by making you feel something about that particular product or service, how people manipulate you by manipulating how you feel. <br/><br/>Which is exactly why Gen Y and Millenials are psychologically disturbed and mentally arrested. You're going to read from other reviewers who claim that 'this is a show for adults,' but a nostalgic period piece 50s isn't a show for adults, but a fairytale for adult-children. And it's a boring one half the time. <br/><br/>
Quite frankly, it's really not that good of a show. it ends all too soon!?!? The same with "The Twilight Zone;" "Star Trek;" "Tales From The Crypt;" "The Sopranos;" "Breaking Bad; etc., and, as a child, "Rocky and His Friends;" "Jonny Quest;" "Clutch Cargo;"...and, (restaurants like "Ponderosa;" "The Black Forest;" "Burger Chef;" Chi-Chi's;" "Howard Johnson's;" "Kenny Roger's Roasters;" and, so many privately-owned places.). I guess I'm bad luck when it comes to loving these things!?!?<br/><br/>"Mad Men" is a great TV series, and, I actually had to be 'pushed' into watching it by my ex. It was a good push, too, because I got hooked right away. It's the kind of series that should have went on much longer (just as "Breaking Bad" should have), but, someone chose to end it!?!?<br/><br/>When you have a very popular money-making-money-machine like "Mad Men"...keep it going!<br/><br/>AMC has been 'pushing out' so many fantastic TV series in the last seven or 8 years, and, I've watched many of them, including "The Walking Dead," which I'm still watching.<br/><br/>This is such an in-depth and complex series where many things with many characters are going on all at once, which is why I believe it has such a low rating as 8.7. I wouldn't show this series to an imbecile any more than I'd put a silk hat on a pig, but, some people who 'just don't understand' come here just to knock something that they 'just don't understand!?!?'<br/><br/>I was just watching the "Mad Men" marathon, on and off, that ended with the series finale this past Sunday, May 17, 2015, and...I can say, I was truly saddened to see it end. AMC must have an open budget to be able to hire the top-shelf writers, creators, directors, actors, et al, as they do for "Mad Men," and, all their other shows.<br/><br/>This is a GREAT SERIES...check it out! :) With the series finale for Mad Men being tomorrow night I find this a great time to review the show. AMC has been running a marathon letting me jump in and review episodes from every season. That has been wonderful as I found episodes where I missed segments where very important things happened that I've been asking myself for years why they never addressed x, y, or z only to find they did it is just the cadence of the show is such that I tend to watch it but allow things to happen without my notice. The bottom line is it has allowed me to review the show, without re-watching it entirely just skimming through the episodes and paying attention to those I knew I hadn't watched closely giving me a greater appreciation for the show. After having a chance to review it and see some of those gaps filled in I went from a 7 to an 8 star rating. The one part of MadMen that always was a negative to me was the cadence of the show. The pace simply wasn't fast enough and at times that is what made me watch the show but not pay attention as things just moved to slow and certain aspects (Don Draper) were repetitive in nature.<br/><br/>That being said it is still a great show that was written about a time when I was a child. It allowed me to see a lot of what was being marketed at the time as the cutting edge merchandise through commercials that created classics that I remember to this day. The writing and sticking to the social and corporate climate of the era is awesome. Especially having worked in a corporate environment for well over 30 years it allowed me to see how things were compared to how they are and how radically different the corporate environment is today vs. then. Drinking in the office, everyone smoking, full business attire all the time, the battle of the sexes and the social issues all played into making the storyline just awesome. This is a classic show with a backdrop that brings up a lot of nostalgia and was done well. With a good story to tell on top of it and you have a very good show, period. It appears they took the path of wrapping up how all our characters lives are going to land and the direction they are heading after the roller coaster ride they took us through on the show to me is a happy ending. I want to see Don Draper land with his feet on the ground, sober, and content to be who he is. He was incredibly entertaining yet needs to come to terms with himself, his past, that he is not really Draper and simply be at peace and enjoy the success he enjoyed because on the show his character was not stable but he struggled with issues that are serious and I want to see him get worked out so he can enjoy what he achieved. He did what many of us can only dream of making it a happy ending if he did it and lands on his feet and along with the rest of the remaining cast go off into the sunset with things going to be OK. We know the advertising world has changed tremendously since that time with big data driving much of how things are marketed today. But it sure was a fun ride as the backdrop to the personal stories. I'm hoping tomorrow ends with them all doing well. We've been through to much together for any other ending to satisfy!<br/><br/>OK, saw the ending and they did a good job on everyone but the main character DON DRAPER! What the heck? I guess I can follow the fantasy that his little smirk in California was the idea for the Coke commercial they showed at the end. But after all those seasons of watching him fall apart I wanted to SEE HIM GET IT TOGETHER! BAD END. I''ll admit I enjoyed the ensemble cast more than I ever enjoyed the disgusting, lying, hypocritical, evil, human trash Don Draper. This character embodies every characteristic of the modern liberal. Lie about everything, be a hypocrite and point fingers while hiding the very same behavior, and blaming your lack of values, morals, and character on Conservatives. The only reason liberals live miserable lives, cheat, and lie their way to the top like Don Draper is because they create a false narrative for themselves. Keep in mind these shows are created by Hollywood liberals who view the world this way, this is not how real men are and women need to stop believing shows like this represent men. The only thing they represent is the fractured values of a fractured town, trying to spread their disease across the country. The story line is very attractive. A group of fearless people that enjoy what they do and are really good at it. Stories that grow and develop, even with the smallest details including secrets, flaws, huge screw-ups which makes the characters very realistic and easy for the viewer to feel related to.
But...series deserved a better ending. Last season feels forced, like if the producer run out of budget last minute and they needed to close the show early.
Overall the series is one of those you love watching like a soap. Not really one of those that you just canÂ´t wait for them to release the next episode, but still you do want to know what happens next. But the ending, itÂ´s just not fare AT ALL with the all of the efforts made to create characters that got to you. I think the directors thought the ending was closer to life, than to give them a spectacular ending or a sounding close....whatever the thoughts they may have had, personally, they just screw 7 seasons with those final episodes. I binge watched this show through 5 seasons. Fell asleep in the last 2 episodes of Season 5 then ramped up again for season 6. What a radical difference between the two seasons. A lot of clothed, humourless, passionless sex with a wannabe Liz Taylor look alike and even Roger is starting to sound like an old grump. Two shows with Pete and his real life wife aside; there is nothing going on here. A lot of people are milling around in 60s costume waiting for cues that never come. Christina Hendricks has lost her luster. The sets as always are fabulous but listen.... listen to the sounds of foot steps on the thin plywood floors of a soundstage. You can hear the floor bend under the weight of actors who have fallen out of love with their 60s personas and the script. I'm going to give it up now and get out my old complete boxed set of Northern Exposure seasons 1 to 6 and watch some real writing in action. Just started this series
seems interesting and so fun to watch <3 My favourite tv show ever.. i want to say the show teaches you everything.
You will become nerd to gentleman ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ I was hooked from the first episode. Jon Hamm is terrific in his portrayal of a flawed charactor. But he makes him likeable and you want him to succeed.
I wish there was another season! Playing the game of media needs a devoted attention that follows him; an ad man who has surrendered to the Ashram at Pondicherry. A university student speaks about comedy in religious knowledge like the Pakistan surrender of the conquered parts of Kashmir which is counter productive if Pakistan has lost the war. 
Referundum to Kashmir is a mistake because the complex issues there are not worth shooting over about but coming to a deeper understanding but we are not yet there is the mistake from the Indian army before and after the official war. 
Avoiding a war with neighbors is a duty that should be done rather than not and even 'Salman Rushdie' who supports a claim for India to reunite with it's emblem of unified India openly talks at interviews about the matter. Mad men the television show which aired and became wealthy by viewers is the basis for the argument that here peacefully is being conducted. May only be good if you're in the industry or can sit through tonnes of dialog. "Mad Men" is a fascinating immersion in the advertisement domain, in the development era of some of the world's most famous brands and companies, among others, inviting people to discover and watch advertising from the other side of the TV screen, showing the global aspects and complexity of this work.<br/><br/>The great cast gives an interesting and realistic variety of personalities, close to daily life, struggling about finding the way to make their own place in this world, about how to give a meaning to their life, about how to find and keep their own balance between their work and their private life, with more or less success, highs and lows.<br/><br/>The main character is the proof that talent and genius often come from creative and passionate people thinking out of the box and daring to push the conventional ideas further to succeed where so many people thinking only inside the box thinking fail, and that truly living means defending his own ideas and convictions, even if this may cause conflicts, rather than just following the stream.
After all, there's always a solution, creativity is the key.<br/><br/>The great image and production quality, some particularly funny or touching scenes, the stylish clothes and setups, and finally the singular simplicity in which everything happens are the cherry on top and make "Mad Men" definitely unique and brilliant. "Saudade," a friend told me, can mean ". . . a melancholy nostalgia for something that perhaps has not even happened. It often carries an assurance that this thing you feel nostalgia for will never happen again." Wiki quotes A.F.G. Bell:(dunno who that was)"a vague and constant desire for something that does not and probably cannot exist, for something other than the present, a turning towards the past or towards the future; not an active discontent or poignant sadness but an indolent dreaming wistfulness." <br/><br/>As much as I resisted watching Mad Men at first, dismissing it out of hand i.e. "ew; a show that 'glorifies' advertising?" etc., once I viewed the first episode I was stunned (don't know how else to put this) at the visual accuracy of the time/ day/ era...I suppose it's fairly typical to feel nostalgia or longing for things that remind us of childhood; old photos of loved ones and family, perhaps from when we were infants or before we were born (for me, 1966). On this count alone, Mad Men held me spellbound. There's that painting, that fabric, those colors, the hairstyles, the scarves, shoes, cars, furniture, all things Mid Century Modern... it's a veritable visual time capsule or journey to the past. It's absolutely stunning in this way. But not just this; it's 1960's NYC. <br/><br/>Upon first viewing, the delivery of the plot, the motion of the series is not typical, and can be somewhat frustrating for new viewers, but after a few episodes this will become more familiar. Looking back on it, it can be thought of perhaps like a sort of autobiography (of the main character, Don Draper), with many important steady characters and story lines that are interesting to follow and sort of fill in the details. <br/><br/>The series is fairly historically accurate in depicting the male dominated world of advertising, business, etc. and social and familial mores of white middle class or petite bourgeois America. From "go" chauvinism/ patriarchy/ sexism is addressed and little seeds are planted in the supporting characters' story lines and words that blossom later in the series. Likewise, white nationalism, jingoism, and racism are addressed and portrayed fairly accurately, to such a degree that ******SLIGHT CONTENT SPOILER******* * * * beyond simply portraying the colonial conditions present in social reality and in social interactions between white characters and African characters, (which by the way, occurs in the very first scene of the series), or historical milestones, ~the assassination of Medgar Evers, the assassination of MLK, the assassination of Malcolm X~ beyond one-dimensional characters, even the shallowness of fake or phony liberalism is exposed in one memorable scene between "Joan," and "Paul." <br/><br/>Likewise, the Korean War (which features heavily in Don Draper's past), the death of Marilyn Monroe, the Vietnam War, the assassination of JFK, and later that of Robert Kennedy, etc. are all incorporated into the screenplay/dialogue, as were the Manson Family murders, the police violence during the 1968 Democratic Convention, and the moon landing. But in this series, we are the people this is happening to, or rather the people watching television or listening to the news hearing of these events for the first time. <br/><br/>It is a joy to watch Vincent Kartheiser (Peter Campbell), Christina Hendricks (Joan Holloway), Kiernan Shipka (Sally Draper), Stephanie Drake (Meredith the secretary), and Elizabeth Moss (Peggy Olson) play their characters; but just fantastic performances from every single character~ an amazing series in this way. I have to say once you've binged this series a couple (or four or five) times, you'll fall in love with Meredith, too. January Jones (Betty Draper) looks like she walked right out of 1963; it is amazing. <br/><br/>From the business competition and warring, to newfound victories and transformations, the 1960's unfolds for us, through these characters, and especially revolving around their advertising agency, the companies that are their clients, the products they sell, and the office politics and dynamics. It's truly a nostalgia trip, and a bittersweet one. <br/><br/>Throughout the years the agency transforms and it is exciting and suspenseful to watch this throughout the seasons, wondering what it will look like next, and how the autonomy of the employees will be affected. This aspect of the series makes it riveting. And the soundtrack, just lovely (each episode ends with a song from the time). The score has memorable themes as well. <br/><br/>Somehow the main character, Don Draper, remains a mystery throughout the series. At the end, which I won't give away (and you shouldn't even try to find out!! It's all the more enjoyable that way!) I asked my friend (whom adores the show) "wtf was that about? What is this series about?" and she said: "Identity." <3 Somewhere on IMDb I saw a list of the most miserable characters of all times I think Betty Draper should be on that list. She is a spoiled child who must have everything be about her Her wanting Sally to continue therapy so that she can vent about her problems to the therapist and then saying "well, if you thinks so "( continued sessions )Firing Carla and saying how it hurt her to do so . She is not happy unless she is admired . Her cruel treatment of Glen because she mistook his adoration of an older woman fo something sinister as she is so very very special . Her smug look when she stands next to Don or Henry and see other women admiring her . Honestly I want to slap her silly. Good job January Jones Bad camera work. I liked where the show was going after listening and briefly watching for just ten minutes in season one. Acting was good. Big fan of 1960's....I really liked the show "Good Girls Revolt" for comparison. The camera shots in "Mad Men" we're intolerable in my opinion. I enjoy screenshots that are more zoomed out. The screenshots in Mad Men are all zoomed in continually bouncing from one screenshot to another. I feel it was hypnotizing. Like I said, seemed like a good show but very poor camera work. I want to watch more, but camera work was intolerable in my opinion. Zoom out on the camera work and I would rate this show much higher. Thanks. A special shout-out to Screen Thoughts listener Erin Burke â€“ who pointed out that we should be sure and discuss Mad Men, which begins its final season April 5 on AMC. Hollister & O'Toole take a look back at the much-ballyhooed series â€“ which has won 4 consecutive Emmys for Best Drama. Join us in paying homage to the Mad Men of Madison Avenue and the drama surrounding Don Draper.<br/><br/>Listen in to hear what this show has to do with Wendy Wasserstein; Archie Bunker; the sitcom Becker â€“ and which cast member is married to "Berger" (the man who broke up with Carrie on SATC via a Post-It note).<br/><br/>Hollister, who's often on the move, had to call this one in from the road (so the sound is a little tinny) but boy are her thoughts worth a listen (she has, after all, her own Madison Avenue experiences).<br/><br/>We conclude the podcast with a clip of a real Mad Man from that era â€“ Keith Reinhard reminisces for Ad Age about how he came up with "You Deserve a Break Today" for McDonald's (which inspired Peggy Olson and Don Draper pitching "Burger Chef").<br/><br/>After all â€“ happiness isÂ… well, Don, you don't have to sell us: a new Screen Thoughts podcast, of course!<br/><br/>Podcast available at - http://screenthoughts.net/podcast/mad-men/ Don Draper (Jon Hamm) is ad-man extrordinaire at Sterling Cooper run by Roger Sterling (John Slattery) and Bertram Cooper. He's a womanizer, distant from his wife Betty (January Jones) and hiding a secret past from everybody. Their daughter Sally has to grow up in the difficult family. Pete Campbell is the ambitious accounts guy. Joan (Christina Hendricks) runs the office and the secretaries. Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss) is the new secretary who climbs to be a writer and a Don disciple.<br/><br/>At first, the show hooks you with the suits and the style. It is cool looking and has some interesting darkness. As the years pass, the characters get filled out. They live in the tumultuous times and exist inside of it without being central to it. It is an office drama but is not simplified by it. A large part of the show is the advertising world but it is much much more. It is devilishly humorous. The most important thing is that it is well conceived and impeccably written. These characters are flesh and blood. They are fully realized and each one is compelling in their own right. It is interesting television. Season OneÂ…...All the Meat is in the Tail<br/><br/>More Bedroom than Board Room, this bit of Retro is Cool to Look at and has Enough Expected Modern Cynicism to Overlay this Soap-Opera with an Appeal that is Almost, but not Quite, the Sharp-Edged Social Commentary it is Hoping for.<br/><br/>Much of the Show's Screen Time is Taken Up by Kissing and Petting, Hopping into Bed and Pillow Talk. In Proper Context this is Fine to Portray the Extra Marital Affairs and the Period Peccadillos about the Subject but there is just Too Much of it, and the Real Edge of the Series is, or Should Be, the World of Advertising, Vintage 1960.<br/><br/>The Acting is Fine and the Costumes and the Ever Present Product Placement of Period Props are Interesting and can be Memory Magnets for those that were Cognizant at the Time. But Love Making, and Sex, and the Eternal Quest for Non-Procreative Attachments is so Familiar that it Makes the Show Seem Ordinary. <br/><br/>It Might go on to be Truly Great TV if They Back Off the Familiar and Concentrate on the Things that Could Make this a Different Kind of Show and Quit Relying So Much on what is Easy. At Least that is the Gist of Season One. Too much Sex, not enoughÂ…<br/><br/>Season Two...Â…Where have you gone Joe DiMaggio?<br/><br/>...Mergers and Acquisitions. This Very Popular TV Series becomes Darker and Deeper in Season Two. There are Still Numerous Bed Hoppings but as Good Episodic TV and Very Long Novels are Free from Brevity, this Opens Up to Reveal Consequences and Conflict that are Captivating.<br/><br/>There is More Balance Now and the Drama is Explored in Vivid Detail and the Social Conservatism, like that in Real Life at the Time, is Showing Signs of Cracking and the Control of the Media Empire of Madison Avenue, like All of the Bedrock of Post WWII, cannot Bear the Weight of the Changing Times and Maturation of the American Mindset.<br/><br/>The Clues are Everywhere, from the Civil Rights Movement to the Possibility of the Ending of the World in a Blink of an Eye, for Example, are Profound Truths that a Facade of Fakery and a Veneer of Vapidity can No Longer Hide. <br/><br/>This makes Season Two even Better than Season One as the Template is becoming Tumultuous and Liberalism is Rearing its Head to Speak Truth to Power and the Table is set with a Menu that is "New". Not the Advertising "New" that is a Lie but the "New" and Improved Cultural Evolution. The Age of Post WWII Innocence is Coming to a Close. my guess that a lot of pros are wondering here reading and commenting is firmly confirmed after i went through the reviews.<br/><br/>i came across the show on the net when looking for some teaching materials for my lecture: an introductory course to Advertising. i sort of like the show and strongly recommend it to the students, warning them it is a little bit porno.it may well be. the guy seeks women all the time. for what? for love,for fleshy pleasure, or for the sake of restless seeking, or for the peace of mind, for a soul mate? <br/><br/>the promotions of the show, as i can grasp here in china, is not mad enough. one is a cover story in an eminent magazine, I Married a Mad Man, featuring a story based on the interview of the lady who married the real-life ad person Draper Daniel or something in Chicago. another promotion is a booth at the Night of the Ad Eator's Festival in NY city in 2010, handing out brochures and fliers about the show. <br/><br/>these are OK, but not mad enough!<br/><br/>the following words are what i have been waiting for while watching this series<br/><br/>at the end of episode 04 season 06<br/><br/>Doc's wife: i pray for you. <br/><br/>Don: for me to return? <br/><br/>Doc's wife: for you to find peace. Beyond advertising, what has kept me glued to this show, beside Joan's fair bosom of course is how accurately it reflects the period. Famous historical references include, the 60s Hare Krishna trend, the 1966 Richard Speck rape and murder of eight nurses, the introduction of LSD as a drug for the intelligentsia before the novelty wore off, even environmental concerns like the toxic fogs in New York, and of course White Guilt. Negro solidarity aside, I felt the lump in Lane Pryce's throat as he struggled to be racially correct when dismissing the black applicants.<br/><br/>The season kicks off with the Y&R office dropping water bombs on Negro protesters, resulting in very bad PR, SCDP then runs an ad claiming they're an equal opportunity employer just to get back at competition, action which results in an embarrassingly dark lobby the next morning.<br/><br/>In the season premiere, Peggy botches a Heinz pitch, looks to Draper for help, but Don uncharacteristically decides to go with the client. Megan, the new wife throws a surprise birthday party for Don, sings a sexy French number and turned all the ad men in the room to hard men.<br/><br/>Just to keep Betty, Drapers ex-wife relevant, the writers assault her with a barrage of bother. From corpulence, to cancer, to controlling Don from afar through her daughter. Peggy hires a new skillful writer, despite her partner's warning to hire a less threatening one.<br/><br/>Some things did not change. Peter Campbell remains his loathsome self, constantly deriding Roger Sterling, having an affair with a commuter friend's mentally unstable wife, finally getting his due when he plied a prospect with prostitutes. In what was the height of the season for some, Don pulls the curtain, Roger lights a cigarette, Pryce rolls up his sleeves and knocks Peter out! After glorifying Draper for four seasons, the writers explore the theme of the insecure creative director and boy, was it fun to watch Don squirm? After getting scolded by Cooper, Don decides to start writing again. He flips through the sketchpad of the new kid one night, and realizes the young ones are catching up. In a very familiar industry twist, Draper ditches the youngster's comps on the way to client and sells the hell out of his own idea.<br/><br/>What does it take to win a pitch? Good creatives or a smoking hot redhead? A portly Jaguar client demands a night with Joan, Peter indecently propositions her, Don insists the creative is good enough, while Lane advises her that a car account is worth a partnership. After being taken for granted repeatedly, Peggy drops her resignation, and her exit is sadly covered up by the noise of the Jaguar win.<br/><br/>Don, this time is quite the repentant philanderer. One would think a deserter will cut people some slacks, but instead he tightens the noose. Plagued with financial problems, especially Her Majesty wanting to make an example of tax-evading expatriates, Lane Pryce forges Dons signature, embezzles, gets caught and hangs himself in his office.<br/><br/>This season begs all of the questions troubling a creative in the industry: are you being appreciated? What exactly is loyalty and when is it appropriate to move on? Is there anything like teamwork? What if you're better than your boss? Will you ever make partnership? Rife with portentous symbols while glamourizing the mundane: a toothache, fixing the sink to the admiration of colleagues' wives, a contemplative stare down an elevator shaft. The show says so much without saying too much, making me wonder exactly how much of the subtext did a Nigerian viewer miss. I enjoy the show generally, for the intriguing writing, the strong performances, the interesting set and costume design. But I get bugged by frequent anachronisms, especially given that the details of the era are so important to the plot line. <br/><br/>A huge bag of UTZ chips prominently on Don Draper's fridge?<br/><br/>PANTYHOSE being slithered into, even so sensually? Nuh-uh. In those days, everyone wore girdles, no matter how skinny, with hosiery that hooked onto the clips or garter belt -- at least until the very late '60s. <br/><br/>That's just today's episode from season two for me. Got more?<br/><br/>I suspect that much of the show's popularity comes from the extreme sex role stereotyping and bias that was indeed typical of the ealry '60's -- an anachronism today? Not always so, m'dears, not always so. The question surrounding the legalities of fans twittering already seems to have some precedent. Since when is a social network bound to reveal the identities of its users -- "official" or not? That's NEVER gonna happen.<br/><br/>"Twitter has not made it clear whether or not these feeds are endorsed by the network. Moreover, AMC did not like the fact that some of the characters were used to promote products other than the show. In fact, some characters were used to promote Twitter itself." -BuddyTV<br/><br/>Here's a link to the post by the guy who actually checked with two law professors who have expertise in this arena: http://blogs.kansascity.com/tvbarn/2008/08/sorry-but-twitt.html
