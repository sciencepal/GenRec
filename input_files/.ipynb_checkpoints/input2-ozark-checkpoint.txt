Season one came out and it had pretty terrific reviews. I watched it right away. I judt don't have enough TV time to watch a tenth of what I would like to. So I rely upon critics a lot with television more than movies. If enough critics pan a TV show I know I am gonna dislike it as well. So critics were not kind to season two. Many said the story was being stretched and so on. Well I am 6 episodes through season 2 cause a coworker told me don't believe the critics. I am certainly glad I gave this season a try. So far it is even better than season one. I don't understand the tepid reviews. This is the Breaking Bad of Money Laundering and it is so rich with great characters and subplots. One of television's best shows at the moment. It's not often that a TV series of the quality of Ozarks, can sustain the high level through multiple series.<br/><br/>Well done to Bateman and his crew, they have smashed it out of the park with S3!! What a rollercoaster!<br/><br/>Can't wait for S4!!! Please don't be long. üò¢üôè I never would have watched this if not for the quarantine. It wasn't promoted well.
I LOVED IT! Great script, tons of action and characters that you love to hate and hate to love. This series is a home run for Netflix. Its a gripping series with superb casting for every character. It is an edge of your seat thriller that grips the audience from the very start. Throughout each episode you are helplessly wondering how Jason Bateman's character will pull through. The writers of the show are spot on with every twist. I highly recommend giving this series a chance and i can't wait for season 2 to come out. From the first episode to the last it is a brilliant masterpiece that deserves better reviews than other people have given. %100 one of the best new series of the year. To say this series is intense would be an understatement. Be warned: Ozark is not family friendly as it has a multitude of graphic violence, nudity, mature language and sexual themes. Not for children. I am not a big fan of contemporary dramas, but it was Jason Bateman's outstanding performance in The Gift that led me to check out Ozark. And his character Marty Byrde delivers the same smug arrogance as a finance adviser turned greedy money launderer whose circumstances hurdles the patriarch into survival mode, which is tested repeatedly. Laura Linney is brilliant as his unfaithful/neglected wife Wendy Byrde who proves she is as much as an urbane grifter as her husband. Everyone in the cast delivered superb performances. The drama-charged first episode managed to pull me into the entire series and although some of the plot seems downright incredible (disbelief) I was captivated until the end. Look forward to a second season. This series is just so thrilling that you would want it to finish in one go. I finished two seasons in two days. The series has everything to offer plus great acting makes it to worth watch. Williams and Dubuque have created a virtuous crime drama. All of the actors deliver superlative performances. Bateman, Linney and Garner are a sight to behold, especially Bateman who steps out of his normal character. Peter Mullan and Lisa Emery portray two of the most convincing and vicious villains with such subtleness. It's almost hard not to admire their characters. The writing, cinematography, directing, setting and acting are marvelous. The plot revolves around a financial planner who ends up in a money laundering scheme. Eventually he ends up having to relocate his family to the Ozarks in order to continue laundering money for a ruthless Mexican drug cartel against his will. The main consequences behind this are trying to save his family and everyone around him. The plot is clever, surreal, intense, violent, unparalleled, gritty, unique, duplicitous and cathartic. The series is pure art and masterful in all aspects. It is outstanding in examining just how far your average Joe will go when lives are at stake. I am a " Breaking Bad" and " Better Call Saul" fan since the first episodes of both series. "Ozark" stands right up there with each and is as good if not better. I can only hope that more seasons will follow. Season 3 is absolutely brilliant. The acting and script are joy to behold. Keep up the great work and can't wait for season 4. Ozark is one of the best series I ve ever seen!
Why Ruthie(Jennifer Garner) has not gotten an Emmy/Oscar nomination is beyond me!Her acting is simply "suberb"I always look forward to seeing what she is up to next!I hope there will be a season 4! In my opinion best show on Netflix.
The writing is superb !! I cant stress this enough!! so many twists and angles. 
Anything could happen.
 Show is dark blue .The cinematography is amazing and the soundtrack!! 
I love those moments in the show and there are plenty when they make you feel something evil about to happen. The thrill , the intensity . This is something new on TV. You have to see for yourself.
Such good acting and writing and they haven't even invested in the Cartel,Mob story a lot . Hope they do that in season 3. I start watching this in quarantine and first I thought it's Ridiculous and it's a copy of breaking bad but it's really good and nice Ozark is pretty much what you'd expect it to be. Its a pretty tense what-is-he-going-to-do-now type of storytelling that makes it easy to binge-watch.It also holds your attention as Jason Bateman plays a similar kind of character as the likable anti-hero keeps falling in trouble.Similar to breaking bad but also quite different. Julia Garner as Ruth totally owns the Qzark.In a top cast she stands out a mile I finished bingeing on this show over the last 2 days. All I can say is, "WOW"! The characters are all interesting and intense as usual from this Netflix release. Again, comparing this series to Breaking Bad is somewhat justified, but with a Bloodline, Gone Girl, kind of feel to it.<br/><br/>The cinematography is amazing (Although, according to filming location info- very little is actually filmed in the Ozarks) I did notice the Bagnell Dam bridge sign is the current one (My family vacations there, having most recently been there in summer of 2016)<br/><br/>This show is a definite nail-bitter and you never know how the larger-than-life troubles will get resolved, but somehow, Bateman's character, Marty , is the man with the plan. If you like crime thrillers, this is one of the best I've seen in years!<br/><br/>Can't wait for Season 2 (and 3,4,5,6, etc...) If you not watched this series, definitely you must start now! This show totally underrated. This is one of the best series I have watched in Netflix. Story revolves around each and every characters, makes you to understand their motives and actions. Lead actors finest in their performance. Must watch series in lockdown Season 3 is even better. The writers actually improved the story in E3. I had to increase my reating from an 8 to a 9.
I hope they find a way to keep it going. Without ruining it. 07/23/2017 I will finish the last episodes today or tomorrow? I was unsold the first 1/2 hour in due to the overused story line of Mr. Big Time Drug Supplier goes on a killing spree and then dictates the future of a family to the father. Didn't seem real, but after I started it back up again, everything came together. Even though it's fiction, the perception of reality, the ease of real life dialog, the gripping story line is lifelike. Very easy to immerse the viewer into completely. I would rate this series with Breaking Bad, The Sons of Anarchy or The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series of 3. It's truly great and the only negative thing that I might offer is that it's all over to quickly, to short/to little for those of us who really love escape entertainment. I've easily watched 100+ movies online since the beginning of 2017, this is my first and only review. You'll love it, I guarantee. Bon Appetit
09/14/2018 I just finished season two (2). It was just as good as the first season as viewers re-immerse themselves back into the storyline, all-over-again but will probably be sad like myself as the season winds down. Why?, because it's really hard to find any reality based entertainment this wonderful to watch anywhere. Ten (10) episodes a year is about 90 episodes to short, but I'll be looking forward to next seasons offering. The cast and storyline are absolutely superb. Bon Appetit The acting,plot,story line every thing is outstanding. The actress that's plays Ruth (Julia Garner) is just simply amazing and is a vital character to the show, Jason Bateman at his best with his quickness to easily out sarcasm the best of them. This show has my all over the place, one of the few shows I've see that isn't predictable, for the most part. Just watch the show and enjoy something different! I'm from Missouri so I had to watch, you know, my people. It reminds me more of Banshee than Breaking Bad because there is no moral compass. Everyone has an evil side but you choose who to root as lesser of two or three or four evils. Characters die violent deaths over almost nothing. It is a slight twist on the money and drugs genre with city folks in the sticks thrown in. The gay characters break stereotypes and the local hicks turn out to be smarter than they sound. If ye ain't from Missoura you might not enjoy it as much as I did. Let me get this out of the way right now. Ozark is an awesome show. If you haven't seen it before, watch it now.<br/><br/>I will admit though, it took a few episodes for me to get into it. I remember going into it blind and thinking "this is a Breaking Bad clone" halfway through the first episode. The show finds its own path though.<br/><br/>I DESPISED one of the characters in season one, but they stepped it up in season 2. Season 3 kind of goes off of the rails, but that doesn't prevent the show from being great.<br/><br/>Watch Ozark. It is awesome. If you like your shows dark but plausible Ozark would be for you. It has a terrific cast, plausible premise and it builds slowly like a terrific series does. Some scenes are violent and explicit with either gun play or sex. Easi Morales is haunting as Del the drug dealer. It's familiar ground for Bateman and probably one of his better roles but it's Linney who's sticks out like a beautiful diamond among cubic zirconium. Her resume is already impressive but this is not her typical role. Julie Garner is excellent as Ruth the hustler. Jordana Spiro as Rachel raises our interest with a fine, subtle presence and audiences will recognize the house guest, Buddy with a laugh. My favorite cameo comes in episode 3 and proves this Canadian singer has a great sense of humor! Probably the best ongoing series right now. The cinematography is phenomenal Season 1
Calling this show tense, would be almost an understatement. The tension is ratcheted up so high, that you can't even imagine what's going to happen. With a gallery of fascinating characters ranging from rednecks to drug lords to a deranged F.B.I agent. But it is also dark, and disturbingly violent. So beware!<br/><br/>Season 2
The tension that existed in season 1, and was practically the shows reason d'etre, seemed to verge on becoming bloated in the first part of season 2. But then it let up, and instead, the writers introduced some new surprises and twists. And more deaths. (Some surprising, and some not.) By the end though I had to confess, I was still engaged and ready to see what season 3 brings.<br/><br/>Season 3<br/><br/>In season three things begin to feel a little less steady storywise. The addition of Wendy's brother, helps a little to get us over the fact that we miss Buddy, but then his character nearly hijacks the entire 10 episodes. The final "shock death" would also have been more effective, if maybe we hadn't seen it coming from three episodes away. Not sure why critics like this Season best of all. For me it seemed the shakiest, and has caused me to revise my rating. Most intense series of all time and the cast is outstanding. Sopranos drops to 3rd on my list. Obvi the main attraction here is Bateman. But honestly the first episode knocks it out of the park. This isn't like your cable network shows where it takes an entire season to get to the good stuff. You're basically getting a explosive bukkake out of the gate. Very tense and dark. The directing makes every scene moody and depressing. Dear Ozark cinematographer - please stop it with the damm "dark" filters on everything / every episode -It's played out and loses it's impact.<br/><br/>Season 1 was compelling, Season 2 not bad but not great, by the time we get to season 3 the characters and plot lines are vapid and falling apart at the seams.
It seems that season 3 was rushed because of the success of the previous seasons.
It's hard to believe or sympathize ANY character motivation in season 3 as they are all selfish murderous lying scumbags.<br/><br/>Everyone save for perhaps Wyatt, Jonah and Charlotte are just not believable anymore.<br/><br/>The series has turned into a cartoon-like unrealistic universe akin to the Santa Clarita Diet.
Marty is an immoral automaton and basically an emotionless piece of cardboard that "is great at laundering money and remaining calm under pressure", Wendy is now a full on sociopathic megalomaniac missing any and all sense of reality. I hope they can whip the 4th season back into shape. As it stands this series has lost all of it's credibility, momentum and sense of nuance and "art". The series started at 9 ended season 3 at 3. From some point in season 2 things went out of control. For the writers at least. Some many inconsistencies I get a headache just remembering them.<br/><br/>You can tell they did a big effort to extend the plot hurting the consistency of it.<br/><br/>At the end of the series Marty and Wendy keep doing the same rockie mistakes they would do in season 1. There were also many stupid and for no reason deaths:<br/><br/>Ruth uncles was just too much and out of proportion. Luckily she was pardoned by Wyatt. Like every killing in the series.
The all plot surrounding Wendy's brother is sooo wreckless, they knew that him without the medication would become a dangerous person, they just let it became a vulnerability for everyone.<br/><br/>The murder of the therapist was also a pretty low spot in terms of consistency. Helen went there and left her name written on the calendar? As well as Frank's? WTF? They cleaned everything but that?
Makes no sense.<br/><br/>Another stupidity, the all situation of the trucks and the drone, why the Laguna's went to the US just to kill 3 low level mafia members and burn all the money? Why not burning the casino or killing Helen or killing the Brydes. They risked a lot crossing the border just to do that? Those actions might have prompt a military intervention on Mexico and just for that? Simply stupid.<br/><br/>Jason Bateman plays a slightly different character than the one he played in Arrested development, same manners, same expressions even same hair cut and outfit.<br/><br/>I regret having spent so many hours just to finish it. Don't make the same mistake yourself. Was my favorite show and highly anticipated Season 3...but c'mon. She's in every scene with extremely long dialogues. First 2 seasons were incredible. Balanced storylines for many characters. So far through 3 episodes it's been 90% linney. Barely any Jonah or Charlotte, sparse Marty, absolutely no scenes with Wyatt (maybe five minutes so far), a little Darlene, and a criminally low amount of the best character, Ruth. Did linney renegotiate her contract so she dominates this season? Enough already. Why do shows do this? Someone takes the worst or least liked character and ramps it up. Hopefully returns to a balance between all. I liked it and I didn't like it.<br/><br/>The first episode really draws you in; it gave me that "oh, I want to know what happens next" feeling. But with each passing episode, the quality sadly just goes down and the ending of season 1 leaves a lot to be desired.<br/><br/>The main storyline is interesting enough to keep you wanting more and it burns through it rather slowly, pushing any resolvement further ahead and ahead. Generally, if it's done well, I don't have an issue with this at all (I even like it), were it not for the fact that the trips it takes off the main path are too often silly and illogical and sometimes just flat out boring, with huge plotholes (which also plague the main story) marking the route consistently.<br/><br/>I noticed that, with maybe an exception or two, I didn't find any of the characters very likeable, and often just plain annoying (those kids are just a pain to watch). There are apparently no normal (and normally behaving) people to be found anywhere, so we are stuck with a plethora of stereotypes and some characters that would probably fit better in a cartoon, acting so silly, stupid and/or illogical, it's almost funny.<br/><br/>What truly was funny, were some of the random moments where it tries to scare you with something unexpected happening, where one scene had me laughing out loud at just how bad it was. Yeah, that had to hurt.<br/><br/>Cinematography overall is great; it creates quite an atmosphere and through its cinematography this show probably also manages to trick the viewer into believing it's better than it actually is.<br/><br/>Acting overall is very good, with Jason Bateman delivering a great performance.<br/><br/>All in all, it's not totally bad, but I found it increasingly difficult to overlook the things I didn't like.<br/><br/>I'd rate it a 6,5/10, but not a 7, so it's a 6/10 - a solid "meh" for season one. Season two will definitely make this rating better or worse. The Ozark a good idea and story. But short on any action or excitement. Annoying characters like the hick girl who says the f word every few seconds. This show is overrated and boring. It tries to be like Breaking Bad but is nothing like it. The show is dark and filmed with a blue tint to make it seem edgy and dramatic. And you continue watching it as you think it's going to build to some action but nothing happens just slow dull drama. I want to like it. Im trying to like it. Some parts are good, but something is missing. I've had to rewind both seasons far too many times because I fall asleep 15 minutes into the episode I'm watching. <br/><br/>That couldn't be anything other than a bad sign, right? You want to see this 7 rise to a 9! Kill off the Wendy character. For the love of God! She may be a wonderful person in the real world, but in this show she is cast as the most irritating, ugly, vomitus person in the series. PLEASE, just kill her! Now 6 episodes in and it's getting worse.<br/><br/>Long shot of Laura linney....followed by extremely long diatribe by Linney.<br/><br/>Just when you think the Laura linney scene is done and they cut to another character....BACK TO MORE WENDY!!!<br/><br/>It's like the show runners are intentionally trying to feature her for an Emmy since Bateman and Garner won already.<br/><br/>This is getting comical. If anyone played a drinking game where every time Wendy is in a scene, they'd all be dead from alcohol poisoning 15 minutes into each episode.<br/><br/>This isn't a rant against being woke and featuring female characters, I've got no problem with Ruth or the lawyer lady or Charlotte...it's just too much Wendy.<br/><br/>"Oh, good, finally they are showing a scene with another character. Marty walks into a coffee shop...NOPE! THERES WENDY!"<br/><br/>Charlotte...finally in a scene...TALKING TO WENDY!!!<br/><br/>Phew...finally someone other than Laura Linney talking as two characters are walking into an office...HOLY F'N SHNIZZLE THERES WENDY AGAIN!!! I think they lost the plot in the middle of S3. The series focused on the life of a mental ill person who was not in the story line from the start. This ruined the series for me 2 first season were something new. This kind of likeable white collar guy, Marty manage to scape from at almost certain execution from a drug cartel. And Marty is trying hard to make the deal work for 2 great seasons.<br/><br/>All of a sudden, Wendy (Laura Linney) took over the whole third season. Great acting but is just way too much of her, quite a lot dumb judging, also writers added a bipolar brother who is unbearable the whole show.<br/><br/>All ladies are in the spotlight Wendy, Lawyer Helen, Darlene, even the best character, Ruth, suffocates with all this PC and #TimesUp charade. Of course, you wont see much of Marty, as he is blindsided by all the women.<br/><br/>The plot of the third season is silly and dumb, its ok for California Dreams and Saved by the Bell.<br/><br/>Best: The relation between Charlotte and her Brother, Ruth, Three and Marty Bayrd.<br/><br/>Please! Bring back The REAL Ozarks in season 4, or just give up! Ozark absolutely lives up to all the love it gets and I am among those who do love it! Ozark is a gripping thriller where the tension continues to build throughout each season and then pays off in a exceptional way each season! People like to compare it to Breaking Bad and where I don't see the comparison and BB is the better show, Ozark is still fantastic and worth every second! The only thing I can't stand about this show is Laura Linney's character (Wendy)! While I don't mind Linney as an actress, because she's a pretty good one, in this she plays an annoying know it all who doesn't appreciate everything Marty has done for the her and the family. Again, it's not her fault, it's just the way her character is written and as annoying as that is it still doesn't take away from the fact that this is a phenomenal show! S3 simply sucks.
The show used to be well-balanced, exploring nice and complex characters such as Ruth, Martin, and Darlene, now it lost its way and became (without any justifiable reason) all about Wendy. She is in every single scene and to make it worse, her acting is not good at all. Wendy's background story doesn't sound organic, instead, it looks like an imposed cliche.
Add all of this to another unjustifiable move, Helen moving to Ozark and there you go...the downfall of S3.
On the bright side, Garner still awesome as Ruth! She is ruining my love for this show! We're supposed to believe that this stay at home housewife and mom... overnight, is now this big boss in charge running things and now Bateman has taken a back seat to her? Why do shows do this? She's the least liked character and now she's in every damn scene! I don't like her acting and I don't like her face. Not sure how she got this part or why they're giving her so much screen time. I hope they balance this back out or I'll give up on this show. The pace is also a little too slow and annoying at times. First season was about Marty and his business partner in bed with the cartel. The wife was along for the ride. Fast track the woke fad and somehow Marty is in the backseat.<br/><br/>Now each episode is like a Laura Linny monologue. Did she renegotiate her contract to be the lead?<br/><br/>They killed off the Mexican cartel bad GUY
They killed off the Snell bad GUY.
They killed off the Langmore bad GUYS.<br/><br/>What's next? Marty Byrd dead and now it's all bad women? Yeeee can't wait. Ok, Ben came, saw and died. What else? A headshot for Ms. Pierce in the final minute of episode 10. At least a small twist. But apart from that we have 10 episodes, each one bloated to 1 hour, when 45 minutes would have been more than enough. First two seasons were good, 8 stars for them, but only 5 for the third. Season 4 I won't watch. First 2 seasons were really good, story of a regular white collar dude navigating threw his job, his family, drug lords, local mafia, redneck clans, local business .... trying to keep control in the spiral. Featuring very good characters (including fantastic Ruth).
Season 3, in a stunning and brave move, they decided to make the show about female taking power.... and.... it's boring. Wendy is on every scenes, the mysterious drug cartel lady lawyer just became boring .... boring. Had to stop watching after 3 episodes. The pilot was well done and pulled me right in. The plot points presented in that first episode were interesting and seemed pretty well thought out. The acting was good, Bateman in particular added a new note or two his normally one-note predictability. The camera work was engrossing. The setup was there for a good noir. Unfortunately each following episode increasingly spirals downward in credibility and competence. The casting is off, plot holes increase in size as the story stumbles along and the writers did just what I feared they would do. Turned the "southern" characters into cartoons. A simple rule for writers anywhere, if you don't understand the south and its subtleties, don't write about it. Particularly if you're trying to create a story with depth. Best series since Breaking Bad, it just gets better and better and better. Tour de force TV drama. Can not praise this enough. Utterly BRILLIANT!!! After watching season 1 I gave this amazing series a 9 for the somewhat slow pace in the beginning, but from the last two episodes of season 1 and the rest of season 2, this deserves a 10/10. The writing is outstanding right down to every detail. The cinematography on point. Every actor was cast perfectly and performed great. Directing was excellent. Can't wait for season 3+! A must see series! The cast and the acting are great. Bateman in particular is very good, I like him in these darker roles. The story makes enough sense that it should work. Direction and cinematography is good. Etc...<br/><br/>But for some reason I find myself fighting to get through a couple of the episodes (I have watched 6 so far) because I am expecting some sort of payoff. <br/><br/>I really don't know what it is that keeps it from coming together for me. There is a certain lack of cogency that underlies the show where I just can't suspend my disbelief long enough. Many plot elements seem forced from an awkward place. <br/><br/>Not sure... if I get through the season maybe my opinion will change. <br/><br/>It's certainly better than a lot f the other stuff on TV. This series has so much potential and has a decent cast. I think the history of the characters were rushed and some of the plot was not as detailed as it should have been. This series could be a huge hit in the coming seasons if it had deeper connected characters. A great example of this would be the TV series Justified. Overall the story line has great capabilities and the ideas within the plot are refreshing but there is room for improvement. This is a show that leaves you thinking: "now how the hell are they going to sort this problem out?".. but then they do...and another one comes along.
Great acting, great story! I just love it. The second series has no humour (black or otherwise) and is too miserable for words. In the first series we were rooting for the family but we don't really care about anyone in the second which makes it rather meaningless. No positives, no wins, no hope just utterly depressing. They've filmed everything in an unlit/blue light which makes it feel even more hopeless. Gave up after episode 4. Watched Jack Ryan on Prime instead. Really good acting, snappy scripts with great production values, up there with Succession in quality.<br/><br/>American series making at its finest, particularly good back to back on a winters weekend, you get lost in the tension. This show started out about a mastermind money launderer who was cunning, analytical and practical. Now he is a sniveling crybaby surrounded by the typical Hollywood idea of a housewife.. She is suddenly the powerful brains of the operations. Luckily she (the housewife) is assisted by the powerful female lawyer and a powerful redneck girl who was cleaning rooms in a motel before she suddenly became a crime genius. They are opposed by a powerful female drug queen-pin.<br/><br/>The majority of the show is about extra marital affairs, family drama and how bad the main star can mess things up by being weak, indecisive and na√É¬Øve.<br/><br/>This show had a lot going for it, but it is now just another clone in the TV world. It has gotten so slow, I paint a room before each show and watch the paint dry during the long boring scenes of which there are plenty. Jason Bateman has really shown his acting ability with this one. This show is on par with Breaking Bad. The cinematography is amazing. It really brings the view into the show. I feel like I am there sometimes. There are many subplots to the main plot that you are always entertained. The tension between Marty and Wendy is so tight. Each one trying to circumvent the other and you never know if they are doing it for themselves or the family. The third season is one of the best. Julia Garner's character Ruth is outstanding. I hope this show is nominated for some awards because they deserve it. I saw that Jason Bateman has taken over some of the directing and he is doing a fantastic job. He is one of the few child actors who really developed into a great actor as an adult. I just wish there wasn't so much time between the series. Also, I understand how people like to binge watch but I wish this could be stretched out longer by having one episode a week. Unbelievably bad, ridiculous and stupid script. The script writers must think that the audience have chicken brains otherwise they would not dump such unimaginative, crappy and ridiculous dialogues and story situations on us. And the characters they have created! Oh my god! Each one is more painful to watch than any other character in any other TV series. Tried my best to watch it. Went so far as 5th episode and could not bear it anymore! Run away from this! I'm half way through episode three and I've come back here to review previously reviewed comments. One reviewer likened it to Breaking Bad but different and I totally agree.<br/><br/>It's the same premise as Breaking Bad, a father is looking out for his family whilst knowingly breaking the law but in a good way {you kinda know what I mean} and so even if he is bad you have a certain sympathy and empathy for the guy.<br/><br/>Handled well this could be as good as Walking Dead before it was handled bad. Season 1 was good and had a certain flow to it. Each of the characters made sense as to why they had screen time. Season 2, seems to be all about the wife and her political career, with lots of spooky and morally dark scenes. Wow, very spooky I feel so dark and gritty I almost cut my wrists on all the edge factor. This movie just went with the lowest common denominator: large but low quality nudity, sex, murder, violence scenes. Yet plays it corporately safe by trying to tally an even amount of screen time between the wives and husbands, as to appeal to the broadest amount of audience (ie: profit in Netflix subs) possible. This appeal to make the show gender equal just dilutes the appeal of it being about a drug empire. I mean, what kind of evil cartel empire draws the line at being politically correct? Seriously, that's the line that they won't cross? Very spooky! So, you should probably watch this show if you're reading the reviews. Ozark isn't for everyone, probably 30-45 year olds who aren't homophobic (like several reviewers on here), and can follow a story that doesn't always follow a linear narrative. Oh yeah, and folks who understand subtext.<br/><br/>Is it the best show ever? Well, no. Is it one of the best shows of 2017, definitely. The main thing that bugs me about this show is that it's written in a way that requires the viewer to empathise with Bateman's character - and that's quite difficult to do. Especially considering what he does to so many other people. There are so many times I've thought, "I just wish someone would shoot you dead and be over with". The viewer is led to believe that he does what he does for his family, that EVERYONE is out to mess up his life and threaten his family unless he does this or that. And, I'm sorry, but that is complete and utter nonsense. It reminds me of all those movies where someone's kid gets killed and the antagonist decides to take revenge... But killing EVERYONE THAT LOOKS AT HIM/HER WRONG.
Initially I really liked it, and would've given it a 9. But as the 2nd season has rolled on and he keeps getting people killed and killing people "because he has no choice" (which is total bulls**t), the show is becoming harder to watch because, frankly, I want him and his whole criminal family dead. Starts with great promise and great cinematography, albeit gaping plot holes, draws you in but disappoints with ludicrous plot-twists that fail to suspend disbelief. Towards the end the plot line meanders and ultimately fizzles out, the character interactions unbelievable and just plain dumb. This is not at all at the level of great shows. It is watchable but I'd say it is definitely a second tier show good to release in summer when nothing else is on. <br/><br/>The filming throughout the 10 episodes was dark, always very dark. It reminded me of The Killing but that at least was in part due to being in rainy Seattle. Just being dark for 10 episodes removed any effect it would have on certain story lines, scenes. <br/><br/>A lot of the story just didn't make sense. Why would they have wanted to get a really upscale expensive office instead of just laying low? And on the other hand why would you make this choice for your family but not live more extravagantly? They said they'd been doing this for 10 years - if you weren't living large wouldn't you have more than 8 million in savings? And why would his partner skim if they were paid well after seeing what happened to the guy they replaced? <br/><br/>Jason Bateman's acting is just being himself. It was like he was on the set of Horrible Bosses. It bothered me. His relationship with Laura Linney was all over the place. They really didn't have good chemistry and their marriage, even in flashbacks, was pathetic and a downer. That she was so quick to jump at her husband getting involved with a cartel to clean their money seemed off. <br/><br/>The story could have been a lot better. They really did a disservice making half the characters seem like red neck inbreds. That know they aren't smart. In a town that is totally corrupt. What are the chances you'd end up in a town with all that drama.<br/><br/>We also had the typical had to interject Obama and the rednecks of course have the Don't Tread on Me flags. Pretty much silly west coast beliefs on how flyover country lives.<br/><br/>There weren't a lot of twists in the story that you would be reeling from. The dialogue was very basic. The characters were never really developed much. <br/><br/>It would have been much better if they had developed the characters more, had better dialogue, skipped all the marital strife that didn't add to the story and use some of the better characters more. The best under utilized character is the guy living in their house. <br/><br/>If you took out the swearing and maybe the strip club nudity this could be on NBC. Disappointed but something to watch in the summer. The premise for this show had promise, but the path taken is just horrible. Essentially, the show is just one depressing moment after another and many of them are just too far fetched to believe. It does have a good cast, but that's all it has going for it.<br/><br/>The depiction of the Ozarks is also just sad. In the first episode, they mention it being a place with money, but then every native character is poor, or a criminal, or both. Anyone who's ever visited the Ozarks will know better.<br/><br/>This could have been entertaining, if only it were more realistic. Instead, it's just incredibly stupid and too far removed from reality. The season is just excellent!every episode is just Great and wonderful!The sequence of episode is Perfect!You can see the tension RisinG in every episode and how the character Deals it it iS Awesome!The Actor plays their role Quite efficiently!First season to third season you have a lot of suspense and The Third season is The best so Far and A lot of best has to Come BeCause "It is Just The BeGinninG"!Loved it You can feel the tension as the show grows.
The entire script is great! First season was interesting. Season three is boring Let me start the review by stating my favorite characters in this epic drama. Buddy, Wyatt Langmore, and Jacob Snell. They may not be the lead characters in this series. But, they definitely leave a strong impact on audience.<br/><br/>Wendy Byrde, Marty Byrde, and Ruth Langmore are obvious characters which you may not deny giving credit. Marty is the most complex character in the series. Ruth has an option for emotional breakdown now and then. But, Marty has no scope for emotional break out and rather try to live in the moment.
Wendy Byrde is still a mysterious character after multiple seasons. The character can turn wild in the coming seasons.<br/><br/>Every character is weaved in such way that they make you convince that their choice of actions are the only available options even though it may look bad.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of drama, Ozark is the bonanza for you. Don't miss. This series has it all! Drama, sex, violence, and outstanding actors! It just keeps getting better and better, and makes me want to go see the Ozarks in person. Absolutely love this show, Bateman is on point and the twist and turns are not scene coming. Beautiful shots and scenery throughout. Performances top notch. Everyone delivers. Very engrossing, noir thriller with a southern twist. Well-written, well acted & well shot. The story-line does have some hard-to-believe plot turns, but overall it is immersive & convincing. Takes off from the sample go Breaking Bad, but with even more unlikeable & morally compromised characters.<br/><br/>I felt Season 2 was not as compelling as the first Season, but Season 3 picked up again. I fell asleep during the third season so many times. I actually couldn't even finish watching the last episode and had my husband just explain to me what happened.<br/><br/>First two seasons, however, were very good. You get attached to the characters really easily and are at the edge of your seat wanting to know what happens next. Very binge-worthy. And the acting is outstanding. A 'soap opera'. A series centered on a particular location, featuring different families with their conflicts and love affairs. And most of your modern thrice-weekly soaps have plenty of murders, drug dealing, teen angst and the rest of it.<br/><br/>Ozark is a great soap opera, because you're never sure which character is going to the glue factory next. Apart, that is, from the central 'Byrde' family, whose patriarch manages to talk the people out to kill him into ever bigger cash-juggling deals. But season 3 blows it.<br/><br/>Not as deeply, memorably good as Breaking Bad by any stretch - because the Ozark maguffin is just a storage-space full of dirty money like the one that Walter and Skyler White looked after. Nobody really cares about Marty and Wendy's marriage - though there is the suspense of wondering if Marty's going to go over the side with Ruth, or Rachel, or whoever.<br/><br/>Good to see Peter Mullan, the Scottish actor, not making a bad fist of a backwoods Missoura accent, but his wife Darlene (Lisa Emery) steals every scene she's in.<br/><br/>Season 2 drags a bit.<br/><br/>And then. And then, I sat through the last few episodes of season three, which crawled by, suspense free as the writers and directors threshed around to find something new, but no. They had done all the shark-jumps, rung all the changes, and Ozark had entropied into pure soap opera. A sympathetic, good-looking character with serious (and well acted) mental health issues (Wendy's brother), is brought in for no particular reason and they spend the last three episodes trying to make us believe, at length, that we should care as much as they do.<br/><br/>In Breaking Bad, for example, there was ALWAYS a multiple-thread suspense story, which often twisted and interwove characters - and the threads lasted multiple seasons.
In Ozark, it gets like watching Dallas, but with women wearing strange trousers. And frequent 'surprise' character bump-offs. First season seven, season two a six, season three a turgid two. It's the perfect mix of everything but isn't cliche. Still blown away at Jason Bateman in this serious role and also as a Director! So well done! The show is far from predictable. Excellent performances by Laura Linney and the cast playing the Byrde family, Ruth, Wyatt - every single character is so complex. The cliffhanger of an ending in season 3 is incredible! can't wait till the next season! I just couldn't get myself to keep watching - this makes no sense. A tale revolving around drug cartels, down low Missouri towns, FBI agents, casinos - and every, every player is a woman? I do not have any issue with this in life, but this is just unrealistic. The few male roles are gay. Yet - when there is some killing to be done, an unanimous male thug is wheeled in and out. Ozark is a story of a dysfunctional family having to move to the Missouri Ozarks so that the dad can re-launder a huge amount of cash for a drug cartel his business partners stole from without his knowledge. The mob boss' reason for having him re-launder, despite the money being clean already, is feeble and adds no genuine notion to the entire premise of the series. The family features a weird boy who studies vultures eating dead things, a spoilt teenage girl who thinks she knows everything, a mother who had an affair prior to the move and a dad who is a money laundering criminal who likes watching a sex tape of his wife porking another man.<br/><br/>The family situate in a town that we continue to learn is hilariously grotesque for no apparent reason. Such aspects are a strip club that breaks every strip club law available, a fuel/diner owner slag who goes out for her 'fuck of the week' to whichever man she thinks is "cute enough" and a neighbour who is dying and walks around naked without a care in the world. Some gypsies are in the mix too, who are, you guessed it, criminals, including an obnoxious girl who mentions her hot-shot "daddy" constantly as a shield for all her actions, and a man who states he hates gays and SHOCK HORROR turns out to be gay himself *cough* American Beauty *cough* to an FBI agent who is completely normal...oh wait, did I say normal? Sorry, I meant he spouts disturbing statements during homosexual acts performed on him by male prostitutes. Just when you thought the script writers weren't trying so hard to be gritty enough, it turns out there's a local crime boss too, because this is apparently a THING that TOWNS HAVE. When met with a priest/vicar, you might believe there is a smidgen of kindness in the town, but it's quickly revealed that the Bibles he hands out during his speeches are filled with drugs. I wish I was making this up.<br/><br/>Literally every character in the entire series is unlikable. The try-hard attempt to make everything as gritty and smutty as possible is too forced and makes for unbelievable scenarios. The 'family man involved with drug money' setting is taken straight from Breaking Bad, the portrayal of every grown up in town as being some sort of criminal, cheater and/or slut is laughable. Every event that takes place is uninteresting as you will not care about the demise of any of these people because they're all awful. Ruthie(Julia Garner)is the best!She is the #1 reason I watch this show! It's not just one of the best it's probably the best going. The writers never cease to write themselves into corners which is what makes it great because they then have to write themselves out of corners. The directors are all good solid . Ozark has a distinctive style some people relate it to Breaking Bad and yes it is like that sometimes but it's very much it's own thing. The directors even distinguished this with the color it's very cold meanwhile breaking bad is always warm. In later seasons of Ozark they start to add some warmth in color but that's only to make the most out of Mexico. Jason Bateman is not only pulling off the acting but the directing and you can see that he's evolving along the way too he's trying different things especially in the 3rd season he's stepping outside the comfort zone that he made for himself in the first 2 seasons. This show is not afraid to cross boundaries either This could've been a 9.5 star if Baterman hadn't tried to please genZ with this woman-empowering BS. Wendy is clearly unstable and wouldn't accomplish without her husband. Am I watching the same show as some of these reviewers?.. Thrilling? Intense? Not once has it made me want to hurry n get into the next episode.. like other shows. . On to episode 3 and not even watching it properly just like episode 2..lol..I'm trying to like it but to no avail.. which means..NEXT!!..Lol..my daughter said the same when they tried watching it After hearing about the series from a co-worker I immediately went home that day and figured I would check it out. Let me say the rest of the week was spent Binging to catch up on two seasons of this addicting series. As of yesterday season 3 has been released and I managed to get through it in two days (lol). The acting is superb and the storylines continue to evolve in a realistic direction that fits. If you haven't watched, you have no idea what you're missing! Looking forward to season 4 already, Great work to the Entire crew and cast ! Sometimes it's difficult watching shows these days, because the time between seasons can be so lengthy. Season 3 premiered after an almost two year absence, but wow, it did not disappoint. Probably because the loss experienced by the Byrds was that much more personal this time. And as always, a movie or show is only as good as its villain, and the head of the drug cartel was indeed very, very scary.<br/><br/>Not for the faint at heart; the action is brutal and swift and sometimes you cannot prepare for what is coming.<br/><br/>I hope in Season 4 they explore more of Jason Bateman's character and what drives him. His reactions to certain situations is starting to make me wonder what's going on in his head. I just finished season 3 and even the violence has decreased compared to season 1&2, and the script is more predictable too, overall, it is a great season. Two last episodes are an acting masterclass. Amazingly fascinating. Tom Pelphray (Banshee) is a great adding and Julia Gardner steals the show.
So, finally this show has potential to become a cult classic, if they can keep the quality on script, acting and filmography on season 4 too. Can't wait. Couldn't make it through the third season.<br/><br/>The women become men, and they're dicks!<br/><br/>Hopefully you have no idea how people actually interact in business, like the writers. Because, if you do, this will make your face cringe into the Elephant Man. Seasons 1 to 3 are excellent! It's addictive and the stories just gets better every season. I can't get enough of it. All the actors fits their roles seamlessly. Kudos to all of you for coming up with a top notch show!! Lame plot, predictable, it's like they are writing it the week before it comes on... and even then they have no idea where it s going. Loop hole? No problem! Just write in a new character to fix it. Right "Buddy" just happens to have an old mob connection. Yeah, sure and he just happens to have relocated and just happens to be the one that can fix the problem - yeah right. The very first episode of season 1 hooked me in, and had me thinking it might be the best dramatic show since the sopranos. Unfortunately for me it just keeps getting worse and worse. I'm not a feminist or anything in any way and I'm all for equality amongst men and women but there is such a strong push in this show to make women as the aggressive decision makers that get everything done and show the men as slow, and indecisive. I worked in a casino for almost 2 years so some of the schemes they pull off has me wondering which is more realistic between the business deals actually happening in this show or Star Wars actually happening?? Jason Bateman is sensible and holds this thing together while his wife Wendy Byrd's eye brows should be billed as it's own individual cast member. I'm utterly shocked that the actress that plays Ruth won an award for this show because her acting is brutal. How hard is it to just swear non-stop and try and get the upper hand on every single character? I was so close to walking away from this show and never watching again when Ruth said a line that was something like "Listen! You don't know F#%& about S$&#!" I don't think I'll ever get into another dramatic TV show again after the disappointment this show has brought. Actually the answer is simple.it's the cast of the show and their great performance.i liked the acting of every one of them.especially tom pelphery. and his amazing performance of ben .great job every one thanks for making this season so good .and don't keep us wait so long for the next season. First off, I loved season 1 and will be back for season 3 with hopes that it picks itself up again. Visually, the show is great, it is directed really well (has a unique mood), and the acting is very good. But the writing really needs to step it up. I was incredibly bored in season 2 and was just very frustrated the whole time. You know how in Breaking Bad everything is always going to crap and then something crazy cool happens in the finali? Well this is like that, but nothing cool happens. I can pretty much tell where each episode is going from the first 10 minuets. Character development is also starting to suffer in the second season. Ruth's story is probably the only engaging one because her character is set up to change over time, although they are really dragging it out. The boy also had a moving scene this season. The other characters have flattened out after dealing with all the changes season 1 brought on. Ok, so I wanted to keep this spoiler-free, but what the heck was up with the preacher? That was crazy random and out of place. I get it, you need to spice up season 3 with a baby and that guy was lame, but the kidnapping plot is so over done. Season 1 started off pretty good but Season 2 is so bad I cannot finish it. The family has relationships with the cartel, the mob while extorting politicians and so much more. Yet it's just a couple and their two kids. The couple have no background on doing any of this and suddenly they take on the entire world of criminal behavior. It's like a twelve-year-old wrote the script. The wife is such a bad actress that I actually cringed. Her egregious over acting and horrible facial expressions are something of nightmares. Please kill her off before she kills off the show. I have lived in Missouri but never spent time in the Ozarks. I loved the setting. Unlike bothers, I didn't feel this was similar to my other favorite series, Breaking Bad. "Bloodline" set in Florida has the same type of feel to it.<br/><br/>Julia Garner as Ruth was awesome to watch! All the actors did a fine job. S1 was enjoyable, nothing to comment on that.<br/><br/>This is all about S2. Apart from the script becoming more and more ridiculous (they actually launder cash, and there are "encrypted accounts", you know.; who wrote that script? A 10 year old?), it is clear that the show fell victim to gender and other PC idiocies. While Marty is practically silent throughout the entire season (if there wasn't a S1, the part of Marty could as well be left out entirely - he has no part in the story any more), his wife suddenly becomes a criminal master mind. Also, the Mexican tough guy now is a woman in form of an attorney, and finally - spoiler - Charlene takes over from Jacob. <br/><br/>In a nutshell: Men are weak emotional idiots (and in most cases dead in the end), women strong logically thinking leaders.<br/><br/>No, thanks. Jason Bateman cannot act. You can see this in the first episode, where his acting during the execution scene shows how seriously you cannot take him as an actor. His business associates are being murdered, his best friend is being murdered, yet he is cool and calm like some tourist in Mexico who walked into a cartel massacre and wants nothing more than to walk the other way and pretend nothing happened.<br/><br/>Through the next few episodes, you discover that there is nothing to like about any of the leads. They're all spoiled, pampered yuppies from Chicago who've never had to deal with hardship in their lives. They walk into this poor town in Missouri and instantly are the smartest people in town. Everyone else is just a rube waiting to be taken. Come on.<br/><br/>It's a silly show. It's predictable. Come on, take a wild guess what's going to happen. It's not hard. It's better than other Netflix shows, but as someone else said, you get the impression that it was mad-libbed to create a show, not something original that will have a solid, compelling storyline.<br/><br/>I'm guessing, like many of the other Netflix shows out there, this was rejected by a better network and Netflix was their last option. Ozark is an underrated crime series. Unlike in many shows of the genre, the protagnists (a dysfunctional family of four members) do not have above-average abilities like martial arts, marksmanship, weapons and tactics, intellectual genius, or perfect charm. The protagonists are very normal, flawed, vulnerable, relateable people-- like most of us. All the characters are driven by realistic motivations and adapt to circumstances in the best and most believable manner that actual people in such conditions and situations would do.<br/><br/>Everybody in the show is pressured: the protagonists, the side characters, and even the antagonists-- and you will feel that pressure so much so that it is actually sort of stressful to watch. Each episode will effectively hype you enough to motivate you to watch the next episodes, without the need to use underhanded tactics like explicit sex and gore.<br/><br/>The twists are well thought of and not over the top, the protagonists do not rely much on deus ex machina to save them, the story is well-written, the actors are great, directing and cinematography are really good. All in all, Ozark is a highly recommended dark drama for fans of the crime genre. This is a must watch! Seasons 1 & 2 are good, except the parts when their spoiled brat kids are on the screen (kids are very far fetched almost comical... such bad acting) ...but then in season 3 the writing and the plot started to become absurd and even worse with Ben (wendys brother). Also the 8 month pregnant FBI agent is poorly scripted and just a distraction. In summary, Seasons 1&2 are ok, but a bit violent at times, and season 3 is almost unbearable at times with Ben and the crazy drama that is in each episode. This series gets dragged out for way too many episodes and too long, each episode is about 1 hour each...could have been done with 30 mins episode. Too much unnecessary drama, too many things that defy logic and common sense, and the kids make this a farce. Great first two seasons. But the third was like pulling teeth. Have rarely seen any series or movie containing that many extremely long, useless, slow and boring scenes that don't have anything to do with the story or adding anything to the plot. It's awesome that I lost my sleep just to know what's gonna happen to end of season 3!<br/><br/>Darlene, Wendy characters - such a strong performance and their age is not a limit. This journal is difficult to be this grasping but I think entire crew done 300% best to make it so thrilling and grasping! Cooo. Anyone who thought Ozark was a poor man's Breaking Bad- eat your heart out. It was good from the start, but has gone from strength to strength, and the final episode...well!. I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it. A deserved 9.6 on this site. Now biting my nails for series 4 and hoping that the writng,acting etc holds up to the amazing quality it has acheived. Long live Ozark. Ozark is an incredibly powerful and completely believable story. Jason Bateman and Laura Linney are as brilliant as one would expect. Julia Garner is an incredible newcomer with many awards in her future. Tom Pelphrey in season 3 is devastating. The writing is intelligent and authentic. It's gritty, real, and evocative. 10 stars. My first encounter was 'smokin aces' that grabbed my attention for this very talented, and in my opinion underrated actor. I of course enjoyed his humor in 'Extract' and 'Dodgeball'. The Netflix original 'Ozark' is undoubtedly the platform that transcended his performance to the elite level. Riveting, compelling and intellectual, while maintaining a steady undertone of violence and drug mongering. I highly recommend this experience for any viewer pursuing deep content with dynamic delivery. Well done 'Ozark'. I rate first season a 7. Then I watched season 2 and rated an 8. An then now on quarantine I finally watched the 3rd season and let me tell you it is happening the same as Breaking Bad. The stakes are so high you can't stop watching. It's a 9. Things got very interesting after the first season, unexpectedly good. A minefield of twists and turns which will keep you hooked. You never know what will happen. Surprising us all the time. And the acting are amazing. All about Money laundering, crime, drugs. Love it! Just finished watching season 3, and all I can say is WOW. It is well worth the wait. I can't wait for season 4. Please tell me there will be a season 4?
The story lines and acting in this series are superb. I rarely watch a series, but Ozark is the exception.
To all involved in creating this masterpiece, congratulations! Well done! -Characters in this show expose their most deep secrets like it's nothing: <br/><br/>"Nice to meet you I'm a drug dealer"<br/><br/>"kids, yo mommy and I will come home late tonight we gonna launder some money for a drug dealer."<br/><br/>-Red neck daughter conspires to murder someone casually while visiting her daddy in prison. No cameras? no guards? Or was it a library and not a prison?<br/><br/>-gay redneck, gay redneck's understanding and supporting dumb brother, gay redneck's two sons reading literature.<br/><br/>-gay fbi agent, gay black fbi agent. fbi agent getting drunk, shooting a TV publicly in a bar while in undercover duty.<br/><br/>gay redneck and gay fbi agent going into a fist fight right before kissing. Wooooo how passionate!<br/><br/>-people getting killed but local authorities are portrayed yet again as incompetent, slacking, clueless people who decide that each and every death was an accident. Typical. <br/><br/>Oh boy this show has so so so so many stupid unrelated s**t going on that I must have forgotten to mention most of them here. Super unrealistic yet predictable events. Dumb story and dumb characters. <br/><br/>Seems like they tried to copycat Breaking Bad but the only common thing about Ozark and Breaking Bad is the word "Bad" in Breaking Bad and "Bad" acting and "Bad" story in Ozark. No one will want a second season. A weird mixture of crime, family problem, social commentary and lots of unnecessary , boring dialogue and unrealistic situations. For some reason many scenes are very very dark. It's easy to compare Ozark to Breaking Bad; it has a guy that has a family to take care of taking some bad choices and getting involved with organised crime, it has a stubborn wife and kids going through puberty, it has a younger person aiding our protagonist while they are being dragged in further and further and it has a bunch of relentless crime bosses.<br/><br/>But comparing Ozark to Breaking Bad, which is, in my opinion, one of the greatest shows ever made, would be unfair to Ozark. It is a brilliant show on itself. The acting is awesome. Jason Bateman plays the quite unlovable Marty in a very believable way and Laura Linney is the perfect counterpart as the hard, relentless Wendy. Julia Garner's Ruth might be the most interesting character, coming from a poor family of hillbillies, trying to help her cousin go to college, being afraid of her dad and just not knowing what to do other than crime.<br/><br/>The show is very slow-paced in the first season, especially in the early episodes. It takes some patience to get to the part when all hell breaks loose, but believe me when I say it will be rewarding. Ozark, atleast the first and second season (at this moment there is no third season) might be up there with Breaking Bad. Season 1 is great and season 2 is not so much. It's like writers didn't watch or forgot what happened in season 1. Marty and Ruth are less of a team. Marty has zero appreciation for what Ruth did. Everything begins to fall apart from the start because someone keeps large amounts of stolen money where no one ever would; even for an idiot. The FBI in no possible way can behave like they do; it's cartoon like. Some of the vulgarity is clunky bc it's misplaced or not natural. The daughter, Charlotte, is aware of the money laundering, FBI, people killed, really bad things in general are happening, yet she decides to steal something so trivial that could have ruined the family. Marty's character is significantly weaker in season 2. I thought everything would grow from season 1, but instead it was quite the opposite. <br/><br/>(typed on mobile, so my bad for any grammar) I can't believe this was strongly recommended to me. It is awful. The main character Jason Bateman is just annoying to listen to and to look at. This is like Breaking Bad in a mad rush, instead of building up the story and adding depth to characters they have crammed about half a season into the first episode and a lot happens in the 2nd episode too. Most of what happens is implausible and boring and the acting feels forced. Will have to stop at the end of 2nd episode, just do not care what will happen to any of the characters. Worst TV show I've watched in a very long time. If you like Mafia themed shows stick to The Sopranos or Breaking Bad and avoid this garbage! Terrible writing, terrible acting, ridiculous and unexplained scenarios. Bateman 'washed' and delivered 7M to Morales by buying tons of AC units, carpeting and sort of building a church. He spent a lot, but no explanation of how the money was recouped.<br/><br/>And weird, pointless scenes... girl goes for swim, finds herself in big trouble, is tired and disoriented, drowns, but surprise! She's not tired. Doesn't drown. Swims home. Yay. Apparently they ran out of drama and had to insert stupid weird scenes to make up for it.<br/><br/>Dumb, weird show that tries way to hard to be weird and 'edgy.' And no, it's nothing like Breaking Bad. BB was good, this is terrible. How dare Any of you compare THIS to BB. Seriously, you should be ashamed. We've failed as a society and humans in general if you think this is even on par with a single BB episode. Season 1 was amazing and very well done, loved every minute of it, was hooked from the first episode.. It had a vibe of breaking bad and narcos mix.. Season 2 however lost that feeling when they undermined cartel and Snells, it has nothing unique or special to offer. I mean cartel made it very exciting to watch, their power and role in the events but it has none of that in season 2.. They focused too much on the characters instead of the events. Writers ran out on ideas I guess. First season's atmosphere is completely ruined, power and influence of the cartel and the rednecks are ruined. What a waste of opportunity after an epic first season. I sincerely hope they make a better season 3 and stick to the theme of season 1. The very first episode introduces you to an odd pair of guys cleaning accounts for the cartel. Peel back the curtains and we discover nothing as it seems. Money has been pocketed by a few that are quickly erased. Marty Byrde, guilty only by ignorance, finds himself in the thick of everything - grasping at a plan laid forth by his late business partner, now as his desperate escape from death. The Ozarks.<br/><br/>Within a few minutes we discover this witty financial planner has more than just a few tricks up his sleeve. He's been busy following his cheating wife, hiring a private dick to lay traps for her mistakes, while also creating false identities in the need that they may one day have to disappear. <br/><br/>It's Marty's quick thinking that drives the pace of the show and it's the cartel's scary bad guy that keeps us on edge throughout the first season. This dynamic of smart guy with a plan and the charming cartel millionaire bad guy up against the red neck stupid's of the Ozarks is what drove me to enjoy the first season. It was a constant evolution of one plan to the next. <br/><br/>Fast forward to season 2 and now it appears real life politics have bled into the show. The writers have made Marty mostly silent, while his wife somehow blossoms into this criminal mastermind - taking on the cartel with grand plans. Our charming cartel millionaire bad guy from the first season is replaced by a female character that lacks any and all scare power. <br/><br/>I don't understand Hollywood's big push to soften men and have (weak)strong female leads. They seemingly neglect to understand what makes a -person- scary or powerful. Instead of writing female characters that are shown learning their abilities (ie working out, martial arts, business prowess), they are instead imbued with unlimited brains and brawn - the ability to overthrow men at the flick of a kick (impossible in real life) or outsmart the smartest financial planner or drug lord (derp). I'm all for powerful women, but I'm not for powerful people without reason. Marty's wife shouldn't mysteriously become a mastermind because she worked on Obama's campaign a decade earlier. The drug lord sends a middle aged blonde attorney (because blonde attorney's are scary?) in the place of a dude that was in the thick of crime just because? Almost all the male leads of the first season are silenced. Even Buddy, the runaway mob guy that acted as comic relief in season one with his crass words, was turned into a harmless lovable doofus - ripe with advice. Might even add that he went from walking with a walker, barely making it out to his chair by the lake in one episode ... to then running around carelessly with a few hacks here and there.<br/><br/>Bateman's performance in season 1 was amazing. Season 2 he was anything but loud. Who wrote this garbage? This show is amazing. Pure art. Love the characters, the writing is incredible, and it just looks great. Jason Bateman has long been one of my favorite actors. He produces and stars as Marty Byrd in "Ozark," an excellent, scary-as-hell drama with a fabulous cast.<br/><br/>The story concerns the Byrde family (Bateman, Laura Linney, and Sofia Hublitz and Skylar Gaertner as their accidents-waiting-to-happen kids). Byrde and his partner have been laundering money for years for the Mexican cartel.<br/><br/>When it all blows up, Marty Byrd begs for his life and convinces a major domo of the cartel (Esai Morales) that he can move to a resort area in the Ozarks and launder even bigger amounts of money.<br/><br/>Well, as in Breaking Bad, the main characters get in deeper and deeper when Marty and his wife thought they could get out in six months. Right.<br/><br/>They come up against a bizarre cast of characters: the Langmore family, consisting of Ruth (Julia Garner) and her redneck relatives, a gay and marginally insane FBI agent (Jason Butler Harne), a bar owner (Jordana Spiro), the Kansas City mob, and the two most trigger-happy and insane people of all, the Snells (Peter Mullan and Lisa Emery).<br/><br/>Kudos to a fabulous performance by Harris Yulin as Buddy Dieker, a dying man who sells the Byrds their house with the condition that he can live there until he dies, which he promises them will be soon. When it all comes down to it, he's probably the only decent human being in the whole cast.<br/><br/>This show will have you on the edge of your seat, biting your nails, and at one point (near the end of season 1) screaming out loud. Though Breaking Bad was phenomenal, it did not have the gut-wrenching emotional impact of Ozark. But again, it's a story of destructive choices and what they can do to not only to a family but the people around them.<br/><br/>If you liked Breaking Bad, you'll love Ozark. Season 1 of Ozark was a gripping thrill ride. Every aspect of the show excelled: a compelling story, great acting, beautiful cinematography, good direction (excellent when Jason Bateman is at the healm) high tension and shocking (while plausible) plot twists. All of the elements were done so well that you became fully invested in the well being of Marty Byrd (Jason Bateman), his family and the others who became swept up in the deception.<br/><br/>The following 2 seasons unfortunately have lost that momentum. Perhaps it's in an effort to extend the show, I can't really put my finger on it. But I do know that it has neutered my 2 favourite characters. The first, Ruth (Julia Gardner), has lost that firebrand that made her a force. She's still says things in a blunt manor but it feels like she's has been relegated to the bench. And being relegated is what has become of my second favourite character, Darlene (Lisa Emery). She might have garnered 15 minutes of screen time in the entirety of season 3 while still being such an integral part to the story line. Even Marty himself has been been mailing it in a bit. It's clearly his wife that has become the decision maker and driving force of the show (and Laura Linney has been more than up to that task).<br/><br/>With more Wendy Byrd (Laura Linney) has come more Helen Pierce (Janet McTeer). Two (more) very strong women and I have to say, I've been very critical of shows and movies force feeding us their feminist agenda, but not here, this show gets strong women right. These are no Mary Sue's, they are not victims, these are real women who's power does not lie in being a better man than the men. Their ascension has been enjoyable but it's also come with some stretches in reality (imo). Mainly Wendy's relationship to a certain Cartel member. I just don't believe it would play out like that. And that's one of the downsides that has risen in the show. Something that has been amplified by the introduction of Ben (Wendy's brother). This character helps move the story to where the writers want it to go, but there is a huge problem, I don't care for him. His is a character that outside of being a plot mover is not really believable, likeable or even dislikable. His actions and the consequences that come from them are predictable, just like the final sequence in season 3 and that's something that I never felt in the first season.<br/><br/>TL;DR This is still a well made, tightly written show that is a victim of it's own success by setting the bar too high for itself. Hopefully the next season will regain the focus and practicality that made the first so riveting. ...during daylight hours due to crappy, dark cinematography. The story is hard enough to follow without the added burden of trying to SEE what is actually going on.<br/><br/>Apparently, my critique does not contain enough characters, so I am adding this unnecessary paragraph. So appropos of the series i am reviewing. I would rather peer through my neighbor's bathroom window and watch him squeeze one out than re-watch Ozark.<br/><br/>Full of pointless scenes that have no baring on the main plot - which itself is weak.<br/><br/>Characters are unbelievable and the writer has been very naive thinking people would buy it.<br/><br/>Not a single twist or cliff hanger that gets you on the edge of your seat or wanting for the next episode.<br/><br/>Really is the worst series I've watched. Jason stars in and directs the first 2 episodes - he sets down the characters, the mood and the pace.<br/><br/>In many accomplished actors/turned directors they concentrate on character driven projects. This is one of those.<br/><br/>Never been to this part of the US it appears to depict - its given me the same curiosity for the characters that I felt with "Justified".<br/><br/>In many of these 'flight from the feds' genre type films this one is refreshingly different. These Feds are not over bearing and heavy handed as they are so often depicted. <br/><br/>Its only slightly into episode three and what I've seen so far has captured my interest and kept it.<br/><br/>A very innovative project. This show has got it all - sex, drugs, violence, murder - and yet it's still quite boring. The story revolves around characters making highly nonsensical decisions. As much as I like Jason Bateman, his performance felt wooden much of the time. A number of scenes (such as the "spanking" scene) seemed forced and very unnatural, almost cringey. I kept watching because of all the glowing reviews but it ended up taking 1 1/2 months for me to get through it all. I just finished season which was the best of the show and one of the best in tv series ever.Especially episode 9 was a masterpiece.Good actors,high quality of plots, cinematography and dramatic depth of another level.Looking forward for season 4. This show just keeps getting better! The acting, cinematography, and writing is unbelievable. Keep it up! ...season 3 became so preposterous that I can't wait until the end to write a review. I'm out. So I'll average the seasons. The appeal was that the story was plausible. The performances are still ok. Ruth carries the show...but even she becomes redundant. No fault of her brilliant work. Jumped the sharkZ. Show starts off interesting enough. Lots of dramatic scenes to go around. Thru 2 seasons are we really supposed to believe everyone is scared of 85 pound Ruthie? The show is getting stale and the homosexuality is really getting old. They pumped in a few new characters this season but I don't know if I'm going to make it to season 3. How is it possible to like a single person on this show? I don't think Netflix expected this show to survive after 1 season bc the writing is really horrible. Had some promise but fizzled out fast. The cinematography is too dark, there are too many contrived dramatic elements (The DEA would be the lead agency in the investigation, the cartel would not sit outside someone's house, etc). Might be ok if you don't think too much about it. This series is a absolutely gripping & it deserves atleast a rating of minimum 9. This show is amazing. Kinda reminds me of Breaking Bad. I just finished season 3. I'm looking forward to watching season 4. I just wish I didn't have to wait another year to watch it. I highly recommend giving this show a shot. 10 stars. Can't find any value in this show. It's too slow and boring I fell asleep, story line goes nowhere really a dump production . Nothing ever happens. Too slow.
Dont understand all the previous rave reviews saying it's an edge of seat thriller. Clearly they haven't ever watched a thriller. Mystery. Exciting. Keeps you on the seat of your pants.
Loved it. ! After waiting for several excruciating months for season three to start for what's perhaps one of television's greatest shows of all time, my wife and I binged watched all ten episodes in one day. Season three did not disappoint! The series is addicting. Kudos to the entire cast and crew! Superb acting, writing, direction, and production. Great complicated characters, and amazing performance by the actors. The show keeps you on edge and every episode is more twisted and dark than the last one. I can't wait for more episodes. Another show where it's difficult to find someone to root for. The word of choice for these writers is "F", they must think they are original. The plot has been seen before. Use your viewing time to watch TV that makes you feel good about life. I'm being generous with a 6. I made it through 4 episodes so maybe (doubtfully) it got a lot better, but the show is slow, boring, annoying characters, and just an overall reach. anyone who has seen shows like breaking bad, sopranos, the wire, mad men, or dozens of other smart, creative shows will be quite let down by this. it wants to be a good show so bad, but it never will. Give it a watch, very entertaining, good actors and character devlopment I've always liked Ozark. Season one and two were very good, but season three is exceptional. Storylines are awesome, acting is awesome, and the show continues the great storyline. I may be biased, mom is from the Ozarks, but show is stepping up to tv elite. When i started i felt little bored.. But slowly season by season it's so engaging u will be gone completely deep into it.. It feels lyk i was in Ozark too.. √∞≈∏Àú‚Äö.. But waao.. One of the best show.. After the last 2 seasons I was unsure how good this one would be, yet it proved to be just as good, particularly towards the end! Just a shame will have to wait a while for the next season .... please try not to leave it 2 years again √∞≈∏Àú¬´ What phenomenal actors are Jason Bateman and Laura Linney! I really love watching it because their acting is top notch and their dialogues very realistic. However, this Ruth character is a miscast. No way a meek-eyed, doll-like girl like her would be a murderous woman with so much prevalence. What's supposed to be thrilling almost becomes laughable. But the series lacks more subtlety. A pastor (or a vicar I would rather say, since he's married) who curses and uses foul language?? Or Wendy who extensively negotiates about her bonus with the broker in the presence of his dominant mother, who is her competitor? Please writers, just try to make it a bit more credible. Up until now, I liked Ozark, but found its pace a bit slow. And also, season 2 was somehow confusing, with too many narrative lines and sub-plots.<br/><br/>That changed with season 3, it's nerve-wrecking, gripping, always on the run. The acting is still perfect, especially Laura Linney who gets incredibly charming with the years. The character of Tom is a great addition to the mix, and Ruth's energy is really one-of-a-kind. Julia Garner playing ruth is very talented. Favorite actress of the show. Amazing RUTH. Season 3 was terrific. Just a flat out great show. Everyone is off the chart good. Not a single weak spot. But Linney and Bateman are wonderful Can't handle Linney in her role but show makes up for it!
Just keep it coming please!<br/><br/>Marty needs to be the focus more .... L.L. is not an enjoyable leading character.... really detracts from what is otherwise a perfect show. Although I preferred the 2 previous seasons,the 3rd one was also very good.I sort of understand and accept that the excessive cursing and complete and total breakdown of moral values are expected in these types of shows.
I felt that towards the end of the 3rd season, too much of unnecessary time was wasted on Ben and this sort of made those episodes drag a bit.
For me as always my absolute favourite was and is Marty who's always so focused and calm and composed except for 1 or 2 occasions in the 3rd season.
My 2nd favourite was/is Ruth who's always so very intense.
Looking forward to the 4th season! I am binge watching Ozark while on quarantine and now I have REO Speedwagon stuck in my head. Thanks Ozark!<br/><br/>I was prepared for Season 3 to not be as good but it is better. Tom Pelphrey and Lisa Emery are just spectacular as are Bateman, Linney and the whole cast. Episode 6 I had to watch twice. Really, really good show. Cannot believe this season is part of Ozark series. So different than the previous seasons which were brilliant.
Ben is the worst actor and cannot believe he took over the plot with his mental illness issues
This series was not about mental illness!! Total let down
I even lost interest in watching the final episode I will echo that this show has potential but falls short. There is little to no character development. I would not compare it to Breaking Bad which is much more complex and original. The acting just doesn't compare and it is relentlessly dark. There are no moments of humor to make it more true to real life. There are a lot of moments that left me shaking my head. <br/><br/>What bothered me is that the writers and producers clearly did not research the area that the show is based around. Why didn't they consult anyone or just talk to people in the area? I am puzzled why they chose to portray the Ozarks with actors speaking like they are from the deep south. In fact, some of the phrases are stereotypical sayings that I would imagine someone from the south saying. Especially Ruth who uses a really thicker southern drawl with ridiculous phrases. There is quite a difference between Ozark Midwestern hillbilly and a southern accent neither of which they get right. Even the little things... being so close to Kansas City, the folks from the Ozarks are Royals fans, not Cards fans. <br/><br/>I will continue to tune in and hope the series improves with time. It's an ok show, fairly engaging. I half believe Jason Bateman as a good guy turned bad but I've seen it done much better. Full disclosure I'm a diehard fan of shows such as Breaking Bad and The Wire, so I cant help but compare, and Walter White will forever reign champion in my book with this genre. Overall it will keep you guessing on the next mishap, but I do find it a bit slow. Hoping it picks up next season. This show is fantastic. The acting is so natural, and Bateman is a genius. Honestly I have nothing negative to say about it at all. There isn't too much sex, nor is there too much violence, yet the show is both sexy and chilling. Each character is perfectly played by the respective actors. There was a lot of hype and when I finally got around to watching this show I was let down. It's a solid show but I found myself disengaged at times, especially the last 2 episodes. I want to feel something when I watch a show. I had no vested interest in the characters. There were plot holes and twists that fell flat, used to shock us but without using the proper set up they left no impact. But I can see how others like it, good acting, pretty good story. Here's to hoping season 2 is better. The story line is unoriginal, characters stereotyped, overplayed swearing, and a denigration to Missouri citizens and the FBI. Jason Batemans character is as believable as Gomer Pyle, and that goes for the rest of the cast -- you expect the viewers to believe this? I do not understand the high ratings unless you enjoy watching gay sex and and BJs in strip joints. If I was to grade the writers, I would give a "C-" for originality and an "A" for appealing to 18-year old boys.<br/><br/>I give it two stars because for the camera work, otherwise a zero. The cartel just shoots and kills a cashier on the spot, for a completely legitimate behavior of refusing a stranger's request to look at the security footage, right in the open. Repercussions from the police totally ignored in thought of action, and after the fact. <br/><br/>That shows how much Season 2 has become a juvenile interpretation of a crime noir thriller. If you can stomach this and much more ridiculousness, then you can watch this. Else, better spend your time on other things. I stopped after a couple episodes. Really over the top and a non-believable story. What a wonderful cast in this series! They have all performed their parts to such a high degree that it was Difficult to separate the actor/tress from their characters. <br/><br/>I am so impressed especially with Julia Garner and Laura Linney. Julia has beautifully brought out the toughness and yet vulnerability of her character, Ruth Langmore. I have not seen her in any other movies or TV series, but her role in Ozark is superb! I do hope she wins a fitting award. <br/><br/>Laura Linney used to be stereotyped as the watered down mum type but in Ozark, the dire circumstances which keeps pushing the family down a dark hole, Laura has proven her ability to thumb out that stereo type peg she was placed in and rise up as the protective matriach and skilful political manouverist of her character, Wendy. <br/><br/>I have known Jason since his acting career started and I an lost inoressed with how far he has cone. <br/><br/>This series will keep you in your seat and wanting to know what happens next. I watched the first season only, and will go no further. The first two episodes are stunning, beautiful. They set up a story that could have been very thrilling.<br/><br/>Then the series starts dragging the usual way: useless storylines, characters that flip sides with no reason, a fluid plot that you know is fluid because a mild twist can happen anytime. Ultimately, it becomes very boring. The audience is never given a hint about how much of the 8 millions is gone, then suddenly the deadline is met. It turns out as a useless, huge McGuffin.<br/><br/>FYI, the fourth episode features rough homosexual oral sex. After finishing all the seasons of "Breaking Bad" and "Better Call Saul", I was looking for something that was highly rated and in the same league. There were some online media houses suggesting Ozark so I decided to binge watch it. I must say, the starting was good as the characters were being introduced. But then, suddenly, the stealing part, killing of Marty's partner and his aides and the gangster Del Rio giving 48 hours to get 7 million that was stolen and another 48 hours to go to a different city just didn't make any sense. Then again, Del killing his wife's lover, Marty having a spy who even has the video of his wife's intimate moments with her lover, I mean, guys, what exactly you are trying to show. It becomes too over dramatic at times where their children are like completely going tangential, and the fact that Marty is doing all this to protect his family and he has no time to check on what his own children are doing just feels like contradicting. Marty gets into issues with local villains who are distributing drugs via bible books and he confronting the preacher with all the details also feels suicidal. The plot is too loose and you can poke too many holes in it. FBI is shown completely disorganized and solo operation with one guy who has probably personal issues with Marty. Then the motel owner, when she sees discrepancies in the books, over reacts on Marty. It feels like Marty being so smart, should anticipate all these and have a plan B. Marty doesn't have control of any situation and he is just shown making on the spot strategy to figure things out. Then his equation with his wife is totally messed up and neither of them have any remorse about what they did to each other. Children are just running around on their own and having no attachment or understanding of the situation and the danger they are in. I think I am going to abandon it or just watch a couple more episodes to see how it goes but so far, quite disappointed.<br/><br/>Will give 4/10. This is amazing; after a long time a TV show really worth watching.
The story is and the acting is just perfect. Man what a show. Its is absolutely crazy!!!! This thing has so many twist and turns it will keep you guessing from start to finish. Guarantee You will binge watch it cause you cant stop watching once you start. The acting from every character is spot on and the story telling is unlike anything you've seen. Jason Bateman is absolutely perfect in this show. I mean Perfect! Best series I've seen in years. Give it three episodes and you're hooked!!! Best show people! Best show on TV right now... Really great story line. Very dark. Excellent acting. Jason Batman is the man of the hour! OZAKA is the Prime Time Emmy award-winning show!
Ozark is not for the faint of heart, this Crime, Drama, and Suspense should display a warning at the beginning of the show. If you have a pacemaker or any kind of heart condition, then this shows my cause you to have a heart attack, considering the amount of stress this series puts on you.
This series is about a smooth-talking intelligent finical advisor who works for a drug cartel, but when his partner is caught shaving money off the top of the dirty money, things go bad. Martin Byrde (Jason Bateman) works out a deal with his boss to launder even more money, which saves his life. Martin then packs up his family and leaves Chicago to move to the money-making Ozark Missouri to start over, of course, while continuing with the money laundering skim, but little did he know Ozark already has its fair share of crime lords.
If you love the series the Sopranos, then watch out because there's a new series in town to take its spot, and it's called OZARK. "All Three Seasons"! I just finished season 2 and so far the serie is good and entertaining! If you're up for series that'll get better and better the further you go, this absolutely is a must watch. It starts 'kinda good'. But honestly, ends 'fking awesome!'. I'm into all narco's, italian mob movies, series like The Americans and even the Wire. My motto "No good, No watch". This definately is a watch. The fact 'sort of' recognized Jason Bateman from some B-class Holliwood movies - where he almost always acted as a perfectionated dork - made this series even better, despite expectations. My advice, give it a try. Because you will get hooked A stellar cast all performing at award levels. Julia Garner as Ruth is a real stand out.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
I haven't been this obsessed with a series since Bloodline. Everything about this show is top notch. I like how the slow pacing still manage to build up the tension sometimes to almost unbearable levels, through the gloomy atmosphere, careful directing and amazing acting and screenplay. Superb writing and acting. I always sigh when I hear someone say a sequel was better than the first, not that it's not possible, but that's always the claim in marketing. Well in this case, somehow the writing and plot got even better. You'll see some people give Ozark an average score because of the increase in screen time the wife "Wendy" gets and how she's so hated as her character. Both true. However it's all done for a reason. And it's sown up perfectly. And Tom Pelphreys acting really needs to be recognized. All that said, Ruth (Julia Garner) shines in every single scene. Watching this young woman work is poetry in motion. She makes you feel everything she feels. Commanding performances throughout, but Julia Garner should be collecting trophies this award season This show is awesome. Review Done. Oh, wait, it's apparently too short. This show is really really really awesome. Like, one of the most awesome shows ever. After long time Netflix produced really good binge worth show. The acting from all actors is really the centre piece along with excellent story. From the first season is enjoying the fantastic story and the more than excellent actors. Everything is right in this series and everyone shines as an actor. Sometimes Ozark seems better than Breaking Bad, which is actually impossible. This is by far one of the best written, directed, scored and acted tv shows I've ever watched. Every single episode is full of suspense, surprises with constant twists and turns!<br/><br/>OZARK is a must watch, it is gritty, terrifying and by far the best tv show Netflix has ever produced. It deserves every award and nomination it gets! This show continues to get better and better. Season 3 was the best yet with the first episode catching your attention and not disappointing throughout the season. Weird, dark and edgy, I liked the introduction of Ben who's story rounded out very nicely. Excellent story and acting... it's good, real good. Amazing series. Each season is amazing including season 3. Can't believe anyone hating on it. One of Netflix best along with Amazons Bosch. That Ruth completely steals the show! Absolutely nails every scene. That girl will surely win an Oscar someday. I think Ozark is the best show have been produced by netflix. Just finished watching season 3, and I'm blown away! From the story to the amazing acting, it's fair to say this is one of the best tv series off all time! Way to go Netflix! Can't wait for season 4! I know the audience should always be on their toes every episode , but with Ozark i enjoyed it most of the time but too much thrill and to much plots eventully will ruin your plots and make the series look lame , and thats what i felt with ozark , great acting and a nice plot , but the rush ends fast with this one !
You get tired after watching two episodes in one session
It's like a pizza with too much topping on it ! Ozark is the kind of thing that exists because someone has noticed since Breaking Bad that doing a show where someone, seemingly a normal guy, finds himself involved in a dark, oppressive crime scene is kind of cool. In effect it just tries to satisfy the formula, of which trying to show off with its supposed smartness (pretending to go beyond the "formulaic") is just one part of the same formula. The main bad guy - which we are supposed to believe is some kind of larger-than-life horror figure - remains unconvincing and shallow, like some minor thug in a movie, which his brutal actions in the first episode, notably directly after he is called to be just bluffing, don't remedy. Characters in general, notably every member of the protagonist's family has an annoying smartass attitude, because it is thought that this would automatically elevate the intelligence of the show and make it more complex. However, it is what it is, just a boring, formulaic try-hard attempt. I'm going to write an unpopular review because I know the popular thing is to like this show apparently. I found all the main characters completely hate-able. The main guy's wife cheats on him, doesn't feel guilty, and then hits him in the face and he doesn't do anything to fight back. I really regret watching this show and seeing how apparently it's acceptable to be a cowardly cuckold who doesn't hit women and instead watches porn of his wife banging his lover. I'm glad Western society has reached such heights. Why is it that in shows like this and in Breaking Bad, the main character has to have such an ugly wife who he has a terrible relationship with? I mean at least later in BB the main character somewhat has a good relationship with her. I don't get it. Are there millions of Americans out there dying to see a horrible relationship among two people? There is so much hatred and negativity in this show. I really wish I could take my 2 hours back. I doubt many who need this message will receive it because it's not like I read a review before watching this. But if I could go back in time, I'd tell myself this show will make you feel bad. If you want to be angry and depressed, go ahead and knock yourself out. Meanwhile I'm pretty saddened at the type of entertainment people choose.<br/><br/>I want to add a summary: the reason I do not like this show is because of the excessive negativity, the dislikable characters including the main character, and the overall direction of the show. They show graphic sexual stuff and it's really disgusting to me, and the main character and his wife have an awful relationship that makes me feel bad watching them. Their daughter is also constantly disrespectful and cursing and being negative. Everyone just has this ugly hateful demeanor to them, and there is nothing redeeming about this except for one single character: the main bad guy, the Mexican drug lord. He was the only character who is charismatic because he's the only person who isn't completely impotent (main character), stupid (main character's business partner), or lying and cheating (main character's wife). <br/><br/>Like I said feel free to disagree with me if you think this is "gritty" instead of what I think which is negative stuff that will pollute your mind and spirit with negativity. I have watched and enjoyed gritty series in the past but they have some redeeming quality to them, and some enjoyable and like-able characters. This is just bad through and through in my opinion. This is coming from someone who watched every single episode of Breaking Bad, by the way, so it's not like I can't handle R- rated TV series. I just think whoever wrote and directed this feels comfortable dwelling in a seriously negative, hateful, angry, mistrusting, sexually perverted and disgusting, violent, spiteful world that I do not care to re-visit in any way. This series is really growing on me. Changing plot lines and good casting. Every actor is doing well and for me that's always a sign that a production is well organized. I like the pace and atmosphere. And yes, it's a bit similar to Breaking Bad but also totally different. Tom Pelphrey shows up in season 3 and he's very fortuned to get this role. And the show is fortuned to get him playing it. It's well written and wel performed by him. I totally understood what was going on and I guess other viewers will also. I hope they will take their time for good new episodes after this third season. With quality investing this could maybe have another 2 or 3 good season's. The show isn't fast paced but it get's to ya. Just sit back and enjoy the ride. 1st season was great, especially the first few episodes. The second season was a bit more hard going, a lot of admin to be done setting up all their various business concerns and to be honest I lost interest. The third series is flippin brilliant. The actress playing Helen Pierce is excellent as is the usual cast and the guy playing Ben has a lot to do and he did it very well. the plot, while there were possibly a couple of holes, is never boring. And Wyatt and Ruth! Loving this! The villains become the heroes!! Props to all involved this was gooood! Quality writing, shooting and story line. Gripping throughout. I love this series and would expect it to have a higher rating when comparing it to what else is out there. The acting to mention especially Marty and Wendy aswell as Ben in season 3 was just exceptional. Season 3 is out and is the best one yet. Let's hope it continues on Amazing writing, characters and depth to this series which makes it one of the best ever. Thrilling from the get go and must see TV.
Will go down as one of the all time greats. Jason Bateman has a very fantastic dramatic role in Netflix's original drama-thriller!<br/><br/>Aside from 'Stranger Things', 'Ozark' has been perfectly watched by audiences at home! Ok show but the interiors are so, so dark. Why? Hard to see who is who. Doesn't anyone turn the lights on? Even the day scenes in the interiors are dark. What gives. To make things worse, only half of the actors faces are lit half the time. So agonizing not watching anymore. Who is responsible for this LOOK?? They should be fired!!!! Don't the actors have any say in how they are lit?
Other than that, show is fair with some interesting acting, but a bit too violent. But what else is new in this day and age of entertainment??
Hard to feel or like ANY of these characters. All so mean spirited and downright unlikable. Show should end with a massive killing spree with all the main characters, even the kids, perished. Season one was great, although it had its imperfections, but season two was outright bad. In fact, I watched only the last two episodes and figured out how the whole season played out. It was unbalanced and full of deaths that was uncalled for. I hope season three is better. The first season was much better. The second season contains too many unreasonable events and idiotic behavior. It is very hard to suspend your disbelief. I really hope they don't make a third season. Everything I have seen so far in this series gives me the feeling of deja vu. But while in "Breaking Bad" there was a peculiar sense of humor that went with the theme or while in "Narcos" even the Antichrist Pablo Escobar managed to evoke some empathy for his miserable life, in this effort of creating another series in the realm of drug entrepreneurs characters are as underexposed as is the cinematography. The writing feels dry and abstract, as doe the acting. Binge watching seems impossible. Literally unwatchable. The show is so dark and blue my eyes were tired of watching the boring long winded dialogue in each scene. The show's plot is slow and uninteresting and I felt like we were forcing ourselves to watch the show. No need for a season 3! Amazing writing from the beginning. Great show. Hard to turn off Aren't you annoyed about series where characters make illogical decisions and things sometimes happen "just because" or just to push the plot further? You will not find these annoying moments in Ozark. The series is amazing with tying loose ends and answering whatever questions that arise and which other series simply would not even bother to answer in any logical way. Ozark is just great to watch with great character arcs, sound actions logic and a lot of emotional heavy load to keep you entertained throughout whole binge. Its a good series with great acting and execution,In short Breaking bad of money laundering.They could have actually got it down to 8 episodes per series, to make it more interesting. Sometimes dragging might be lil disappointing because you want the show to move it at a pace keeping you engaged.Overall great series and overall would rate season 2 a notch higher.<br/><br/>Season 3 bring it on!! The show would be 1000 percent better if you could actually see what you are watching. An idiot must have been in charge of production. I struggled through episode one, over three nights. I then tried to force myself to watch episode 2, at which point I came to my senses and stopped the audio-visual torture. In no way is this show captivating. The characters are all odious, the plot is farcical and the acting is drab.<br/><br/>I'm yet to understand what has prompted so many of my peers to claim that this show is recommendable.<br/><br/>From what I could stomach this show is terrible. There're always shows that start strong and then fade away just like that they turn into soap operas and lose track of everything like GoT and La casa de Papel after gaining so much popularity. Well, this isn't one of them when I started watching Ozark 3 years ago I thought ok it's a good show with breaking bad vibes I specially liked the actors and the supporting actors and always wondered how they find them, but after 3rd season I ways blown away .. the writing Oh my God the writers are amazing It's almost as good as breaking bad in a completely different way . I loved Tom Pelphrey and and I think he's the discovery of 2020 and I loved Lisa Emery and Janet McTeer even more . The representation of badass women is so great and different from all the other shows. I hope season 4 gets even better and the show gets more recognition . Brilliant writing and acting. Tom Pelphey's performance as Ben is stupendous. Episode 9 is an actor's workshop in playing shame. Truly awesome performance . One of the greatest finales of any other Netflix series I've ever seen. Season 3 of Ozark has been the best season so far. Awesome show, stunning actors and amazing writers. Keep it up with the guys. Best show out there. Couldn't stop watching, so intense and unpredictable. Worth watching. Can't wait for next season. Great show, but his daughter is sooo annoying and stupid, she made the show so boring and full of not needed drama, her moves OMG 6/10 because of the daughter. Ozark feels like they're trying way too hard to be Breaking Bad in the Midwest. Laura Linney overacts to the point of pantomime. All the actors playing the Byrdes are not very good but Linney is by far the weakest link in the cast.<br/><br/>The writing is cliched with simultaneously too much exposition and too little information. I wanted to like it much more than I did. I thought this show was good but not as brilliant as some people here seem to think. Definitely worth watching, a story that kept my interest with actors I like doing a good job with their characters. But I never felt very engaged or on the edge of my seat or anything, and the drama wasn't as impressive as I expected it to be... maybe my expectations were just too high based on word of mouth. Season 3 is a disappointment. Ruth's character has just become an annoying presence and its illogical that she is still around. So sad that another show is ruined by feminist politics. I had a little adjusment 'problem' at the beginning of season 3, was such a long time ago. I found the first 2 chapters of this new season a little annoying,
From chapter 3 is just awesome!! very exciting!!, and again all the photography, story line, and acting are GREAT!!
It is just like being a part of that family yourself!!
Ruth is just something else! great actress with great value for the whole serie... actually like all the rest of the characters in the serie.
I hate you with all my heart Navarro!! ;) Season one was great in setting up the characters and seasons to follow as well as really developing the typical slide into darker parts of criminal underworld. Season 2 disappointed by doing too much. At one point there were I think 5 families, three government organizations, and two mafia involved. Everytime something turned one way two other stories and castophroies would follow where you forgot about what had happened by the time it came around. Season 3 was as complete a possible without getting so complex that the story lost its touch with the viewer. I can't wait to see what comes around season 4. Stumbled upon this gem once i saw the trailer playing with Kanye's song in the background. Can't emphasize enough how mesmerizing of an actor Ms. Linney is. This is one of the best series i have watched in a long time. Cant wait for the next season! They had a very good thing going. Very good... not great... Then, like so many other series, season 3 proves to be too much, too difficult to sustain. In this case, however, it's not the usual dead or missing person coming back to life. Nor is it the usual eavesdropping character from behind said wall, lurking... When those things start happening, and they almost always do, I turn the damn show off. All that said, Ozark boasts fantastic acting, good writing, etc., but STILL!!! I couldn't stand watching season 3! It was like War of the Roses all over again. I simply hated both of them and their god damn bickering so much, poof, I'm done. Some may say that's the hallmark, the pinnacle of fine cinema. No it isn't. Not if you turn it off in the middle of an episode and don't even care what happens. I think the writers watched breaking bad and thought, we are gonna write the best drama crime series ever. Man o man they failed miserably. I'm gonna give it 5 stars coz of cinematography. Cheap production as they are unable to hire someone who can write a script and someone who can remove the dark blueish filter. And actors are just not as terribles as other cheap production.<br/><br/>But what's really behind my 1 star review, is the extremely graphic content, as they show gay sex and children in a stripclub getting lapdances. Just because something is on "film" does'nt mean it's okay to show. Seroiuosly, extremely disturbing scenes!<br/><br/>It is so sad seeing films and TV being destroyed by these people. "Hey guys, we'll have to make a season 3"<br/><br/>"But we are out of ideas boss"<br/><br/>"Well, we can introduce a crazy brother who will mess things up so badly that we'll have material for at least 7 episodes"<br/><br/>"Great idea boss, let's do this" Bateman's character is too wimpy. He is the weak point of the show. The storyline is engaging, but people react too much the way the Byrds want them to react in every situation. A casino bill in 24 hours? lol So far the second season is a letdown. I'll keep watching because of the promise of cartel involvement. The show is getting ready to "jump the shark" though. Jason Bateman is one of my favorite actors on the present movie/TV landscape, and I watch most everything he's in that comes my way. So I took a big departure by watching a series crime drama, Netflix's premier of Ozark. And I quickly found out why I never watch these hackneyed depression fests that you see so much of today. Ozark is too dark and too violent for me. Personally I detest this trend by cable networks in producing TV series obsessed with crime, violence and murder, and worst of all, trying to sell it as part of so-called normal life of normal people, as if the world is a giant mafia. It's not. People who brand this type of programming as "reality TV" are full of crap. These programs do not at all depict the vast majority of real life or typical real people in the world. If they did, our civilization would collapse.<br/><br/>And it just doesn't make sense to me for two parents to have enough integrity and responsibility to raise and care about children, feel compassion for others, desire a family community life, and yet participate in terrible antisocial crime, conducting business with evil criminals and murderers. It's mutually exclusive; conflicted. In my mind you can't be both a good person and a ruthless criminal. And even if this story does make sense to some people, I loathe it.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I couldn't like Bateman's character, or most of the characters in Ozark. I couldn't continue watching Ozark after the fourth episode, so I stopped, which marks the first time I didn't want to watch a Jason Bateman film. The abysmal story cancels out the good production qualities, acting or directing. The only way I could watch another episode of Ozark is if it promised to include a massive police raid that ends with Del & Snell and their henchmen serving life prison terms (or preferably death sentences), and Marty & Wendy serving probation for felony money laundering, avoiding prison only because they cooperated with police in convicting Del-Snell. That's closer to reality. I gave a 9 to first season. It was good, very good.
But on the second season, things are so slow and everyone it's just talking and talking and talking again.
Come on, it's that all: I just have to see people talking for how many episodes?
I gave it a 5 to the 2nd season. The pilot was fantastic, and I would have given it at least an eight star rating. But after that, it immediately went sour. I blame the writers, for having a total lack of knowledge outside of other movies and TV shows. Disconnected from reality, they only use stereotypes with zero depth. The dialog, the characters, the situations...all are ridiculously unbelievable. Ultimately, it is a really bad copy of Breaking Bad, but mixed with Winter's Bone. A terrible show. I wish I had skipped this one. It's as if writers sat around and decided to create a show just to undermine every facet of small town life. It's perpetually cast in this hypothermic blue with high-pitched background noise. This is a show in the Breaking Bad vein, and it's shot like a horror movie. <br/><br/>Unlike Breaking Bad, this show is very much interested in disparaging its setting. Extras and supporting characters are usually portrayed as dim-witted local yokels. With eyes closed, the dialogue sounds like it was written by someone in LA, not someone from Missouri. Furthermore, the talk about "hillbillies" and "rednecks" is contrived and the fact that it drives plot points is ridiculous. <br/><br/>But most of all, absolutely most of all, when a show gives the illusion of drowning a baby, I get off the bus. This show is dark for darkness' sake, and not a realistic take on the region it takes its name from. Each season just gets better... The 3rd was probly the best... one of the best tv suspense thriller dramas ever!.. Cause it's all those things I usually like my sci fi so it takes a special series in this genre for me to fall in love with it... Enjoy! Season got me so involved emotionally and so mesmerised . Not a single episode that feels like a filler. This is the new breaking bad without being breaking bad. The writing is on point , and there are so many episode that would win an oscar if there were a movie. A lot of deep life problematic are broached such as Mental Ilnesses , the essence of each individual, moral conflicts , internal contradictions...Definetely would recoommand The season 1 started as a weak 7, which is good enough really because the theme was terrific, the dark humour was like honey and the characters are worth knowing. It had everything to make a good show but it lacked a good adhesive, something to make the audience grab on to their seat and lurk for a character.
However, as the plot thickens, the interest rise up and every point I've mentioned earlier goes from a silver plater to a platinum one o such a short notice. By the time you finish season 2 you're already in, if you get to season 3, well you're now a keeper.
You will follow the dark adventure of a family man who takes every turn to salvage what he has left for his family. You will learn about his past, present and future. Everything that the premise uses will be discussed, prolonged and with it each of the choices this family makes will leave you begging for their success.
Each and every character you will meet throughout the show will be refined, will get a proper character development, the problems might resurface from old friends, or new buddies.<br/><br/>A solid 9/10 Ozark is one of few shows that can start out great and consistently get better throughout each season. Season 3 by far was one of the best seasons of televised The average Joe family are having a typical life and before you know they are swimming In sea full of sharks! The idea is great and the show picked up with good momentum.
The failed miserably soon after. The show is simply monotonous, cold, and bleak.
They keep adding unnecessary drama for no purpose what so ever. A good plot or twist that renders a shift in story telling and shift of power is amazing. However their plot twist and mostly useless.
The main characters marty is so cold, aloof, distant and reactive. Half way through season two he is still hanging by on a thread with sheer luck. And windy oh don't get me started. She has got to be the most fake character ive ever seen on television, that fake smile always on her face and every thing she does lacks sincerity.
The character development and relationship buildup contradicts what would happen in real life. But we are watching a show so let's buy it for a second. But why would you go and kill off the most authentic characters in that show. Basically when del Rio was killed off so blatantly in the first season and then they killed buddy In the second there are no more characters to like any more!
I would give the show two things, writing and acting are top notch.
I'm disappointed however I still have to finish it. This series is so dark. Compelling viewing but dark. Wow this show is amazing. The cast are incredible. The characters are all so unlikable on purpose yet you still root for them. So many twists and turns. So many tears. Even some laughs. And season 3 is the best yet! Can't wait for season 4. I loved the first season. I think it some of the best thing Netflix has cooked up for some time. A nerve wrecking thriller-drama that keeps you on the seat episode by episode. The Byrde family relocates to Ozark after Marty's (Bateman) accountant firm laundering mob-money goes awry. He saves his life convincing the mob that he can reclaim the money owed several time over by laundering them trough various companies in Ozark, Missouri. And of goes the Byrde family to stir a small native controlled tourist place in to something quite the opposite.
There is organised chaos in every sense from that point on, but the directors and writers lays everything down in to a nice red line so well not to keep throwing you off.<br/><br/>The cast is terrific. Jason Bateman pretty much glides into his role like warm slippers. I think the role was perfectly cast for him. To me, he is an actor with little range normally, but fits the bill brilliantly here.
Other, we find Laura Linney icast in a role we are not normally are accustomed to see her in. She plays Batemans better half that seems to enjoy going from regular housewife to laundering drug cartel money full time quite enthusiastically.
But the star of the show is no doubt Julia Garner playing Ruthless Ruth. An N.Y native actress that nails the southern bad-ass gal that is spewing out commanding profanity left and right to just about anyone in that stand up to her in the show. She hits the ballpark with both behavioural and the accent moves down to the bone. An actress to absolutely watch out for.<br/><br/>To be honest, i had huge doubts the second season would roll off to the same heights after that somewhat closing finale. But i got to say, again, the writers have done a great job keeping it going. Season 3 is possible the best since the start, and i can√Ç¬¥t wait for the next one. I won't write about S1 or S2. They were incredible. The building pace, the arc and development of the characters, the darkness, the brutality and unpredictability and, of course, the top notch acting. Season 3 is ok but I found myself fast forwarding many times. Darlene was left behind, the pregnant fed is nowhere as interesting as Batty. Also, the brother side story took too much time which could have been dedicated to more interesting characters or situations. I found that too much of Helen also destroyed her aura and menacing presence. Navarro's actor is far from being as good and imposing as the guy who plays Del Rio. Season 3 has too much talking, boring plot and could (and should) have gone into a darker, brutal and more interesting direction. Still, the Ozarks is a top notch tv crime/drama. Lots of good stuff in this series, but at its very core, which is the husband and wife, I feel like it is flawed. Marty supposedly is super smart, but a smart person would never do what he does. And the wife just isn't likeable. I hate her stupid fake smile/frown that she is ALWAYS doing! Ok I get it-"Ozark" is about dark subject matter. Money laundering for an evil and absolutely ruthless drug cartel. Murder, suicide, dysfunctional families, meth, heroin, infidelity, crooked politicians, torture and despicable characters. But why is virtually every scene either in a dark room, at night or if in day taking place in shadows. Even arch criminals turn on the lights in a room. "Ozark" continually has scenes where people are doing functions in a home or office and there is barely any light.<br/><br/>Just finished season 2 and I saw it has been renewed for a 3rd. They did leave some story lines hanging around so I'd imagine the writers can put together more preposterous plots. Having been to the Lake a number of times in my life the biggest problem isn't from organized crime but rather the morons in their jet skis and cigarette boats racing up and down a lake that isn't very wide but very long. As a result, the place in the summer is a continual cacophony of engines and water wakes from sunup till sundown. Season 1 was so much fun, thrilling, interesting and light.
Season 2 is very very dull, boring and dark, impossible to enjoy and play next episode right away which we were doing while watching season 1. Netflix is putting out some excellent content these days, IMHO anyway, but to say that this a 'GREAT' series would be an over statement. I thought Breaking Bad was one of the best Series TV has ever seen, and this show kinda reminds me of it. I really want to like this show and I'm still watching. I'm on E1E6, but like so many other Movie like Series that come out of the Hollywood established crowd, the writing is Lazy. I have nothing against Gay plots into a Story line, but the one here is fake, phony, and seems like they had to force it in the plot to make a political point. It's like they're trying to make a point that has nothing to do with the main plot of this show, "hey not only are big city FBI guys Gay, but the big burly trailer trash redneck is one too" Really... From the beginning, it is clear that Netflix is simply pushing their agenda with this series. As you watch further, it gets even more in your face. <br/><br/>Episode 2, a cop that has been following Bateman is gay, as is his partner. Only 3.8% of the population identifies as LGBT,...so why is there always a character who is gay? The math simply doesn't add up. But, that's not the problem. The real bullshit part of this series comes about episode 4-5. The gay cop is able to 'seduce' a completely straight guy to turn gay. To the untrained eye, this doesn't mean much. To anyone with half a brain, this is brainwashing. It signifies "See? Anyone can decide to be gay!" Which, hilariously, throttles liberals own ideas that people are born being gay. Obviously, for some, it's a choice. Way to go, Netflix, you played yourself.<br/><br/>Then, there's the racist, sexist, old, dying white guy the family has to live with. Yeah, a liberal's wet dream. Don't even get me started on that.<br/><br/>Finally, we come to the point where I finally made the decision to turn this trash off...episode 9. This scene absolutely shows the ignorance of liberals when it comes to the issue of guns. A kid, obviously underage with a fake ID, comes into a gun store and wants to buy an 'assault rifle'. One look, and you know the kid is underage, but the clerk walks him through the gun purchase process anyways. The kid accidentally marks that he is purchasing the gun for someone else on the paper. The clerk, ever so politely, informs the kid that he can't sell him the gun since he marked that box, and informs him to instead mark the correct box that states he is buying the gun for himself. Then, proceeds to ask the kid if he wants to purchase a 'high capacity magazine' as well. Then, the scene cuts to the kid standing at the checkout counter, gun in hand, purchasing it. If you have ANY knowledge of the process of buying a gun, in any state, (especially Missouri, the setting of this garbage,) then you know that the aforementioned scene is complete, and utter, bullshit. You have to fill out the paperwork, first and foremost. If you mark the wrong box, or even the wrong number for your address, they can't sell you a gun. Period. Know who came up with that law? You guessed it, liberals. If you make it past that hurdle, you then have to give them your ID, and you get to wait for nearly an hour while your name, ID number, and Social Security number are ran through NICS to check EVERY SINGLE BIT of your background, down to the last parking ticket you received. If anything comes up, guess what? No gun. Know who came up with that? Liberals. Plus, you must be 18 to purchase rifles, shotguns, or ammo for either. The kid in this scene was obviously not 18, much less 21, which his license appeared to be horizontal on screen.<br/><br/>In closing, don't watch this trash. Was there no budget for lighting? In scenes you can't even work out who the characters are. Ruins a good show. I have to agree with several of the viewers who watched 'Ozark'. This follows a very familiar format, and I think most people recognized it early on. Jason Bateman is really good at his craft, it's great to watch him, but to me, he is oddly paired with Laura Linney. I don't get their connection at all. After watching 4 episodes, I am especially annoyed at the characters of the children. It's always, always the same with these types of shows. A teenager filled with angst, behaving in ways no real parent would tolerate, and the younger sibling filled with compassion and wisdom beyond his years. Also, is it me, or are there teenage girls who really look like this character? This odd, beautiful-yet-strange look Hollywood throws at us...ugh...! So tired of this worn out stereotype of American teens. I get weary of watching this family when they are all on screen together. Then there is the homeowner, again...cranky old man who is dying so he can do and say whatever the hell he wants and offers no apologies. There are too many familiar clich√©s in this show, but I must admit it has peaked my interest, and they have my attention, at least for this season! It seems any made for Netflix or Amazon *original* programming has to involve a strip club and/or sex where the woman is nude but the man is somehow a never-nude who is fully clothed. It is off-putting, with the the state of the U.S. I want entertainment that doesn't remind me how little women are valued. Season 1 was a great thriller, the way they introduced all the characters and their arcs was great. Season 2 has been a let down unnecessary violence with giving Marty's wife a greater role ehh didn't make for a good story in my opinion especially Laura Linney's acting was not impressive, Marty and Ruth are the standouts the writers should have focused on them. Season 2s ending was horrible to say the least and *spoilers* giving Mason's child to the witch was what destroyed it. The extent of depravity this family has gone into is fleetingly reflected when Charlotte wants to get emancipated any sane mother would let her get emancipated from this toxic family,but nope the mother has to play the I'll do anything to protect my children clich√® card. The selfishness of the parents is on full display and frankly except for Ruth and Marty noone really has any redeeming quality, the wife represents the heartlessness and false facade of sympathy. Ruined season 2 for me sadly. Crime Drama leaves reality behind in backwoods boondoggles. Marty and Wife get in a fix every episode and escape every episode. How? fictional writing magic. Marty can't keep his mouth shut (nobody can really) and so everybody knows everybody's "business", really! , They are all criminals and they tell every criminal they meet exactly what they have and what they are up to.
. Local heroin producers give Marty a tour, explaining everything they have and how it works! really!, Need a casino to laundry money?, no problem because Wendy will get bill through the Mo. Legislature in no time at all... really! Local criminal rednecks actually give back a million dollars in cash... really? Sick old geezer in the basement actually can help you with the KC mob.!... really!.. Its an endless list of not believable criminal activity, with lots of violence and dead criminals.... fortunately Marty and Wendy bought a mortuary where they can cremate the bodies... really!
You can actually just watch every other episode of season 2 without missing any of the plot... really... I give it a grade "C" and suggest no season 3, especially since they have killed off almost every character except the family. Have you ever watched a movie or a show in which everything went wrong--kinda like Married with Children but not a comedy? That's this show. In fact it should be called: "We keep getting into deeper sh*t"<br/><br/>Marty Bird (Jason Bateman) is a financial adviser that helps launder money for a Mexican cartel. Everything is fine until someone steals money from the cartel. Cartels do what cartels do and Marty saves his own skin by proposing some grand laundering scheme to be done in the Ozarks of Missouri. If things weren't already screwed up for Marty and his family they became infinitely more screwed up once he moved to the Ozarks.<br/><br/>A show can hold your interest with a good story, good acting and interesting characters. Even if you don't have all three then you better have two out of the three. The story was one I saw as promising initially but I quit the show two episodes in. Why? Because I had zero give-a-bleep about the characters. Let's see: I don't like programs about dysfunctional families in general and I don't like teenagers in particular. Those two elements were enough incentive to completely stop watching the show. But, a coworker begged me to continue watching--promising how much I'd appreciate it like it was the next Game of Thrones. Well, I obliged (I was at home sick anyway so wth). I only finished the show more upset than when I started.<br/><br/>Not only is Marty the money man in all kinds of trouble, he pretty much drags his entire family into the mess. And, if there wasn't enough drama with the story, EVERY decision he makes causes more problems. It's like gimme a break. He should be able to accidentally do something right. He's holding off the Mexican mafia, the redneck mafia, the feds, local law and local yokels with nothing more than fast talking and the four leaf clover he was born with. <br/><br/>I don't know anything about the Ozarks, never been there and never plan to go. If you'd like to see the twisted machinations of Ozark life then this show should be a blast (and if you're from that area you may resent everything about this show). I don't care about Ozark life and I certainly didn't care about Marty Bird hence I had nothing to keep me watching except to satisfy a coworker's need to not feel alone in liking this drivel. <br/><br/>Honestly, it could have been Marty Bird the character or Jason Bateman the actor--I don't know. Jason is serviceable as the straight man in a comedy but he becomes downright annoying as the lead in a drama. Does he ever blink? He has a permanent fixed stare that he uses for every single scenario. In any case, had they coulda killed Marty, his wife, his kids and I wouldn't have batted an eye. One thing is for sure, kill the show. Just completed Season 1. Ozark disappoints. It felt like a committee-scripted show that tries to be all things to a select few people--the "Hollywood" caricature of life between the two coasts. There is no authentic narrative, just an accumulation of too-brief scenes of ODTAA ("One Damn Thing After Another"). The Perils of Pauline style of story-telling, where the Byrde family gets out of one jam just to fall into another, is insulting and cynical. Every character, of course, has to have a sexual or other personality quirk. Every rustic has to speak in parables. These aren't authentic, recognizable people. Peter Mullan is one of our finest actors, but he's the Whit Bissell of modern television--he shows up in every show. Will Margo Martindale appear in Season 2? We deserve better. Really? this series is really poor. It has bad timing, bad acting, childish to the end, forced environment. A try to copycat Breaking Bad with a 13 reasons why style. The least credible story you can watch. An understandable sense of humor. You can't trust this story since the second episode. So poor! If you liked S1 and S2, well you better quickly watch S3! It's 10 times better. Focussed, thrilling, with a great momentum. Bateman and co took the show to another level. And the ending?! ... Oh wow :) *NO SPOILERS*<br/><br/>Season 3 continues the gripping peril and tension we have comes to expect with this excellent chapter in the life of the Byrde family. Narrative-wise it is somewhat predictable yet excellently paced without the padding that made season 2 inferior to the original.<br/><br/>6 of the 10 episodes run over 60 minutes, so if you fancy a 10 hour tv binge this weekend then look no further! Breaking Bad meets Justified.....etc, etc, etc.<br/><br/>The first episode is pretty good and will draw you in. It goes downhill fast from there. It's disappointing because I really like Jason Bateman, but he can't save it because there's nothing worthy of saving. As others have mentioned, none of the characters have any redeeming qualities. It's difficult to like any of them. <br/><br/>We get it Hollywood, you love Obama and people from the South are redneck, uneducated hillbillies.<br/><br/>If you dare watch keep the remote handy so you can fast-forward through the gay love scenes where the FBI agent is getting it on with a male prostitute and then later a gay redneck. Disturbing on so many levels. Best thing you can say about season 3 is that it's over. Never thought I'd say this but even during this lockdown when I yearn for any kind of good entertainment on TV, I wished they had just *not* released this garbage filler snooze fest that was season 3.<br/><br/>It tarnished the reputation of this show and made me downgrade from 8/10 to a barely above mediocre 6/10.<br/><br/>Anybody reading this review in later years, here's hoping it improved back to old strength in season 4. That said, as things stand, you can skip season 3 altogether and you wouldn't have missed a thang. I really don't know what people are giving good reviews on here, unless they can just sit through anything. This show is just horrible, and Jason Bateman has never been an actor. One episode and done, too funny and stupid all in one. I know a very bold statement to make, but once you get invested into this show and finish season 3, you will understand what I am talking about. The 1st 2 seasons were decent, but nothing spectacular. The 3rd season is on another level and honestly breaking bad level of brilliance and tension. The introduction of the character of Ben was outstanding and bought a completely new level to the series. The acting is top notch and I can't wait to see what season 4 has to offer. So I'll just sum this season up, all men are stupid barely able to function, and they can't accomplish anything unless they stand on top of a Mary Sue's shoulder. Not one redeeming straight white male except Marty, played by the show runner Jason Bateman and he has nefarious morals. I truly believe that this show is a multi Emmy worthy show. That Ben character better be back for season 4.
I honestly thought this show wouldn't get any better than season two but I'm still sitting here, contemplating on what to watch next,because this season has left me in an unexplainable state.and I've watched breaking bad,that's saying something.Don't want to spoil anything but if there's any evidence that this show is binge worthy and mystery/thriller gold,its season 3.
Amazing character development,acting(especially on Ben,Bateman & Laura,of course) and an even stronger season narrative are what truly make this season a masterpiece. It's a shame that the writers need to put in so much profane vulgarity. Not necessary. I do not want to see a man sucking on another man's genitals. Why is it necessary to fill the dialogue up with cursing, the F-bomb and GD? Too bad writers need to pepper their works with profanity. Do not watch this show. ...must have mush for brains. "You put my son in danger" hahaha says the mom who is in bed with a Mexican cartel plus A SQUILLION OTHER GREED DRIVEN NEFARIOUS ACTIVITIES.... "you re worried im still upset about what you did to the horse " mom talking to Mexican cartel boss man hahaha . THIS SHOW IS SO ABSURD its a great concern that there are people here calling it "brilliant" and even BETTER THAN BB, are you all paid by Netflix maybe to say these silly things as surely you can't mean them. Everything here is phoney as f except the Ozarks (and Ruth). First two seasons are awesome. Season 3 is just utterly boring. I suspect shills are trying to pump up season 3 but it is just lifeless and trite. Staging the whole season on a gambling boat and getting away with all the money laundering is just too far fetched! My wife and I watched three episodes but gave up at that point. The series features a collection of totally implausible characters doing things that strain belief. There are also little irritating things: the supposedly upscale financial adviser and his wife say "f..." all the time. I can't believe the average ratings for this series. Netflix must have many paid reviewers. Don't waste your time on this series. I really dislike when shows add pointless side stories to the main story as if it contributes to the entire story at all. There is so much wasted time and pointless plot to this show and it's really unfortunate coming from Jason Bateman. Please don't give it "just one more episode" if you're on the fence, it'll be wasting more of your time already spent. The first series was great, we were rootng for the family and hoping they would succeed. The second series had the Bird family starting to get ruthless and nasty. In the third series there's no one to like anymore, everyone is a ratbag. Thought Season 1 was fantastic but Season 2 blew me away. Jonah is the best but all the characters/actors are phenomenal and it's so clever you just feel the brilliance of Jason Bateman and whoever else makes this happen. If there's no Season 3 I will end my Netflix subscription... The series is currently done with season 3. It's definitely entertaining and well produced, with some great moments; but it's also full of shortcomings when it comes to storytelling and characterization.<br/><br/>This is especially apparent in the first episodes when the antagonists keep getting fooled by fairy tales you'd tell a kid and characters interactions are plagued by dialogues lacking subtlety and development. Many major characters are also heavily stereotyped and unsympathetic at this point, lacking nuances and interesting traits making for a quite bleak experience devoid of emotional involvement and engagement. This improves a bit with each passing season while still persisting and season 3 is indeed the better acted and produced. But while getting less annoying it also becomes more depressing. It really is a spiral into sadness, melodrama and bad decisions with no one to root for as every major character is either extremely annoying or a cardboard cutout.<br/><br/>I'd say watch the first couple of episodes and decide from there. That is, later on production quality might improve, but the basic framework of the show, how characters behave, the dialogues and the turn of events don't change much. No dout it's a great show but who else find it similar to breaking bad, ordinary family involved in to drugs world .the same idea! Best season so far keep up the good writing let see what season 4 bring us This show just keeps getting better! The acting of females characters is amazing, cinematography is really good, and writing is unbelievable. Keep it up!
Ruth Langmore is the best character of all Season 3 is by far the best of all the seasons. Every single episode up till now (ep 4) is simply spell binding. Extremely entertaining. The 1 hr per episode goes by too fast. Haha. I have enjoyed watching two seasons of this Netflix series. It resembles a bit of Breaking Bad as mister good guy Marty gets sucked into becoming a launderer for a Mexican cartel. The apparent 'normal' family gets into more and more trouble without being caught, yet over time the emotional strain of trying to cover up their criminal activities begin to take its toll, especially on Marty. It's good that near the end of season 2 the writers have given him a more human and emotional side. <br/><br/>My only critique would be is that it's highly unlikely for either the Byrnes, or anyone sanely enough, to trust hillbillies like the Langmores because they appear to be rather unstable. A cartel would not approve of that either I presume.. I can understand their angagement with the Snells as they seem to be more intelligent.<br/><br/>At last I would like to mention that I'm surprised that in the end all the women (Wendy, Ruth, Darlene, Helen, Charlotte) in the 2nd season seem to have or take control of matters. It's refreshing but perhaps a bit over the top. I shall miss Jacob Snell as he was a true asset his role is this exiting Ozark. How could it be bad? In the first couple of episodes, there was hope. I've lived at the Lake of the Ozarks and the portrayal of life there is remarkably accurate. The acting could hardly be better. It's not really so dramatic, but it's not supposed to be a documentary.
The series; however, is just---bleak, bleaker, bleakest. I truly dislike these people. Is there any chance the drug cartel will dissolve everyone in acid? That I would watch. This is one of the best shows ever made. I've binge watched every season the day they all came out and I absolutely can't wait for more. The acting from Tom Pelphrey in S3 was award worthy! Can't believe I watched episode 1 and only now started the whole series up again---could not stop watching! The plot and the characters are awesome. Quality writing most of the time (although that does vary depending on the writer of record for a given episode) and exceptional cinematography and performances are largely undermined by a narrative that wasn't fully planned out ahead of time. <br/><br/>Oh, clearly some things were. But many things were not. <br/><br/>And in order to pad out the 10 hour running time, we have a lot of "up and back" in the story and in the characterizations. One day Ruthie is being defiant and telling her father (Cade) to F off, the next day she's blubbering like a little girl and telling him she'll do better and make him proud, and then the NEXT day she's being defiant and telling him to F off again, etc. <br/><br/>What??<br/><br/>Inconsistent characterization.<br/><br/>But I guess the producers had no choice, because when you're doing what amounts to a "10 hour movie," you've got to tread water.<br/><br/>Another example: Early in the story, Cade is threatening his daughter Ruthie, shouting "Find the Byrd's money so we can steal it!" and then later he's contrite and saying "Forget what I said about finding the Byrd's money" but later he wants that money again and then just as quickly he FORGETS about the money and seems content to make a living just stealing boat parts until the final episode when he is all about finding the money again.<br/><br/>So, more treading water. <br/><br/>And it feels like there's an inordinate amount of "up and back" in the story regarding the upcoming vote by the gaming commission. <br/><br/>"It's looking bad, folks. Sorry. They're never gonna approve that casino."<br/><br/>"It's looking good! We think they're gonna approve the casino."<br/><br/>"Ouch. It ain't looking good. The commission may not approve it."<br/><br/>"Looking good! We're pretty sure they'll approve it!"<br/><br/>"Uh oh ... Not looking good ..."<br/><br/>Etc.<br/><br/>Treading water. <br/><br/>So, as with many quality serials, OZARK season 2 (like OZARK season 1) plays like a riveting 2 1/2 hour movie stretched out to 10 hours. I will be honest, I'm about four episodes in, and I couldn't care any less about what happens with the rest of the show. It does not have me hooked, on the edge of my seat, biting my nails, or even invested in the characters. They're unlike-able. The plot has too many holes. And the writers seem to have thrown things in for the shock factor. Except it's not shocking. Just insulting. <br/><br/>Having lived in Missouri my entire life, including four years in the fine town of Lake Ozark (Yes, that's the name of the town. Yes, the lake is called The Lake of the Ozarks.), I can assure you that it is not in "southern Missouri" as is stated in the first two episodes. Find it on a map and you'll see it's very much centrally located. <br/><br/>Having also lived in Springfield, Mo, I can assure you that even down in actual southern Missouri, people do not talk like Julia Garner portrays in her character Ruth Langmore. Her over-acting accent grates on my nerves as it seems like they are trying to make people from my state appear slow and uneducated (not that people with southern accents are, but they are often perceived as such). Combine her over the top accent with the portrayal of the other "locals" in the show and you would think the lake area is filled with uneducated, redneck, hillbillies straight out of Drliverance. Even the inept grocery clerk who couldn't produce the pistachio ice cream. Or the guy sitting at the bar of the Blue Cat the first time Bateman's character visits. Despite the recent NAACP travel advisory against Missouri, you'll find many of us mid-westerners are known for our kindness and human decency, not calling people r*t*rds due to chromosomal conditions. I keep waiting for the Byrdes to meet real people. The kind of people I actually know more of than the ones like those portrayed. <br/><br/>Furthermore, they make the lake area look like a dump. The brief shot of the strip (the area near Bagnell Damn where Jonah is seen walking in the first episode was practically deserted and that's not how it is. Ever. Even in the winter. And it's not winter. The characters are regularly wearing t-shirts, sleeveless shirts, shorts... prime tourist season. The strip would have been packed. Where are the million dollar homes that actually surround the lake? Oh, I know! They're actually at the lake! Not in Georgia! While the strip scene was actually on the real strip, much of the rest is not actually filmed at our beautiful lake in our beautiful state. (We are NOT fly-over country and actually have a lot to offer tourists.) <br/><br/>Bateman and Linney are fine. Honestly, I feel like they both have one role they play over and over. Linney has referenced a brother with issues... which made me think she's the same character as in Love Actually. It'd be great to see expression or emotion or even chemistry from either or both of them. <br/><br/>Let's not forget the tiny little john boat Bateman takes out in the first (maybe second?) episode is laughable. Nobody in their right mind would take that dinky thing on the lake. It is a busy, high traffic lake, with wakes that would capsize that boat in minutes. Oh and when the sheriff said Ruth was living with her uncles in the cove... the cove?!? Which one?!? Ridiculous. Almost as ridiculous as saying the lake is in southern Missouri. I'll be perfectly honest. I loathe the way this show portrays Missourians. Essentially it's a weak grab to touch on the equally typical Hollywood condescension towards Missouri of the Winter's Bone movie. The area portrayed in the show is one of the top vacation spots in Missouri. That's about the only thing this show got right. It was boring and insulting in equal measures. So they have turned season 3 into the women are great-show. Third season are really silly; unrealistic and just for the usual Hollywood liberals fantasy world. Boring. Everyone knows what the show is about. I wish to point out where it strongly went wrong.
1. Season one was about consequences. This made it powerful and demonstrated the foe is here and will make his presence known. This is what made it compelling. Once the drug kingpin was assassinated at the end of season 1 Season 2 became a meandering nuisance of secondary characters leading the main characters down roads the audience didn't care about. Each supporting character who troubles the events becomes an idea in the audience's mind, "Just kill them already, so we can get on with the real show."<br/><br/>This was apparent with the preacher who had no narrative substance other than his faith in his luck. This show is about perception, mostly perception of the self, and everyone in the show is fundamentally desperate, but that isn't enough to make a show watchable. Characters need to do something that forces them to make decisions that push that envelope of desperation and the carving out of the Self as being questioned by its own perception.<br/><br/>Most notably was Wendy. Oh poor Wendy. She represents everything men have grown tired of in life and in television. Overbearing, all knowing, condescending, rationalizing her whole life, nothing making her happy, and of course blaming her husband. Ho hum.<br/><br/>Shows today love to bring women to this higher ground while simultaneously bringing down men's competence, as if it were some car insurance commercial. The constant movement of dysfunction and incompetence, and this even includes the writers, who forsake all character logic and simply allow idiots to take over the ship.<br/><br/>Season 2 and Season 3 both followed the same formula of allowing secondary characters to run the show. There was no further movement, accomplishment. The boat just showed up in between seasons so we didn't really see anything. Then the drug lord was left in Mexico because his handler was murdered, we saw no real cartel presence and thus threat. All we were left with was an old lady lawyer who complained about her personal life bonding with someone she would potentially be killing, again the writer's being foolish. This girl power nonsense went on too long but I did like how it petered out into a puff of smoke.<br/><br/>The one thematic element I liked was the fundamental principal of how things come full circle. You think you will find refuge in fresh faces, but in the end nobody knows you better and wants the best for you than the older relationships and this case, a marriage. Finally able to understand their mistake, and they are in over their heads, they try one more reach to save their own lives only to find out more victims lie in their wake.<br/><br/>It does demonstrate their death that follows them. A life lesson in true toxicity and the end result. However, there were so many missed opportunities, I can't dare to lay them out here. Someone instead tried to do what so many Netflix shows do and that's demonstrate how great and smart women are, and to verbally condescend to men and force them into stupidity to make them look bad. If you want to hold up women, that's fine, but the simultaneous put down of the opposing gender is so Soros driven, it's sickening and old!<br/><br/>I really thought in season 3 Wendy was going to take over more than she did. I thought she would come to the brink of killing her husband but that never happened. They were simply tested to see if each other cared.<br/><br/>Wendy was taken to the brink. It took truly breaking her for her character to get it. A reflection of life. But this story isn't really about her. She was supposed to be along for the ride. Instead. Marty takes a back seat when he is the true talent in this scenario. But the writer's completely lost that ability in the mix of all their secondary character nonsense.<br/><br/>
This is why you don't write a show around misfits. It's hard to make misfits do anything realistic. They won't put on a cape, they won't do anything genuine, they are dysfunctional and have no sense they deserve success, so henceforth, they make bad characters to follow. Evidently there will be a season 4 by how the left it. Great performances, with an intensity to match Dexter and Breaking Bad (although it lacks the absurd humor of the latter). This show is a must watch. Its easy to get into, the acting is great. It is tense and very well thought out. This show will not dissapoint. Cant wait for season 3 to come out. Stuck with it for 5 or 6 episodes as I could feel a Breaking Bad undertone. However it is just so slow and I found it much less gripping than BB. Why do they have to go so dark and depressing the second season of Ozark is morbid and pointless.... I liked the first season a lot but I can even be bothered to go past episode 6 in the second season it's like watching Eastenders. This is easily the dumbest and least plausible crime show on TV. The protagonist talks his way out of everything, usually with a pathetically weak scheme that makes no sense. The antagonists (the Snells) are the least intimidating or believable bad guys in the history of recorded media. The FBI agent tracking the Byrds is a lame ripoff of every "troubled cop" you've ever seen and the Preacher (a supposed man of God) happily sacrifices his own pregnant wife rather than simply go to the police or leave town. <br/><br/>If you have a functioning brain, avoid this show. Only suitable for mouth breathing, mentally stunted Trump voters. Season 1 of Ozark is state of art film making. Perfect visuals, directorship. Every line is well thought of, story-line progresses with constant force, making you question your own beliefs and moral grounds.<br/><br/>The Series throws the masks that we put on in the modern society to feel safe, good and righteous. It dissects the modern system deeply and removes the morale of the money, business, family and society models and mixes everything up into a pile of dirt that will make you question yourself whether the modern society is just a relaxing feel-good paramount of the harsh truth behind the whole concept of wealth, territory and belonging.<br/><br/>Watch these series with clean slate approach, but watch it carefully as every visual hint, every tone, every word is important.<br/><br/>Cinematography wise, this production is very close the the European film aesthetics which is positive if you want to produce such heavy soul crushing atmosphere. European production would be even more merciless with its characters, but this is a leap forward in our expectations about the honesty of US story telling. <br/><br/>I hope to see Season 2, but I also hope it will not be just a recycle. Great job to the whole team! The story is really bad though the actors are good and the direction is good. The story is bad because it makes us think that we can all be delinquent and that delinquents can also be good. It's violent, with too many dirty words and it's definitely depressing. A kid who embraces the rifle and shoots, a guy with Down Syndrome to whom the same rifle is being handed, families who with a twist on the fetus pull off a woman's body and a father drowning the baby in the water ... well they are not things To be seen in a TV series for everyone. During the first season I probably would have given this 8 or 9 stars. I couldn't even make it half way through the 2nd season. Forget about the 3rd. The interesting story just kept getting smothered by one profanity spewing (It is on Netflix and can say anything you want. We get it.) unappealing character after another. SOME clever, well placed profanity can be a wonderful thing but this is just saying it because you can. Lazy writing to say the least. There might still be a good story in there somewhere but I can't wade through the garbage to find it. Maybe the two drink minimum crowd can. This is the best season os ozark so far! Soo good i was always so excited for the next episode This series gets better.. I loved the script Seems like breaking bad in personality and principles changes... Seasons 3 got me by surprised it was amazing I would say the first 2 seasons are slow burners for me, they were good but didn't wow me. Can I tell you now SEASON 3 has stepped it up to a different level. The most gripping thing I've seen, I couldn't stop watching & didn't look at my phone during it once (and that says a lot). Season 3 was up there with the best things I have seen. Wow. After viewing season 3, my overall rating of the show rose from a 7 to an 8.
It was one of the most satisfying viewing experiences of TV since Breaking Bad's series finale about six and a half years ago.<br/><br/>When Ozark was first released, I liked it, but I wasn't ready to let go of Breaking Bad yet. I wasn't ready yet to accept that some shows are going to come out and be very similar to and copy some of Breaking Bad's greatness. It was too original and I wanted to remember its immaculate production. However, as time has gone by, creating a vacuum in which it has never been replaced or surpassed, I've longed for the experience again, and despite Better Call Saul being the (disappointing) prequel of it, no show has been able to bring back anywhere close to the Breaking Bad feeling for those long six and a half years like Ozark, which is now officially "Netflix's Breaking Bad".<br/><br/>First of all, let me make this clear: Season 3 of Ozark is hands down the best season of the show, and there is no question about it. Unlike the prior two seasons, I didn't count one bad episode this season out of the ten and only found one of them which was a little weaker.<br/><br/>Secondly, and I mean this: there are at least 6 actors/actresses in this season who deserve (and will likely receive) Emmy nominations:<br/><br/>1. Julia Garner (Bateman and Linney are the key, but make no mistake: this is Julia Garner's show. She is the star, even if it doesn't always seem like it).<br/><br/>2. Jason Bateman (should win)<br/><br/>3. Laura Linney (will definitely be getting a nomination, if not winning an Emmy this season, particularly for episode 9)<br/><br/>4. Jessica Frances Duke (Yes, she was THAT good)<br/><br/>5. Tom Pelphrey (Would be surprised if he didn't get nominated)<br/><br/>6. Elizabeth Becka (Her part was very well acted and conceived)<br/><br/>7. Lisa Emery (her best season yet as crazy Snell lady)<br/><br/>Even some of the other actors a case can be made for at times.<br/><br/>The only thing bad about Ozark season 3 is that, it's over. And we will have to wait probably a year to year and a half for the next meal. This is great escapist filmmaking, the kind of show that makes you forget all of your worries at the door as you enter the world of the Byrdes in the Ozarks. This season, every single episode is paced tightly with very little adipose tissue to fill out its lengthy runtime. When it was over, I was just mad that it would be an entire year or more before, if lucky, we will get another season.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this show is everything Better Call Saul never was. It tells a story, creates constant tension, creates empathetic characters, deals with the morality issues in the Breaking Badesque way, but it also entirely separates itself as its own thing with new characters. Oh, and in this season, season 3, the HUMOR finally hits! I laughed out loud at many scenes, mostly with Julia Garner, but also with the Snell lady. Still, many actors/characters had funny scenes, including Pelphrey.<br/><br/>Not to take anything away from the rest of the actors (as stated they almost all deserve Emmys), but this is still Julia Garner's show, and even though she was phenomenal in season 1, this was her best season yet. Once again, she nails every little tick of her character, constantly brings humor, and earns sympathy from the audience.<br/><br/>For anyone (especially Breaking Bad fans) who haven't jumped on board the Ozark fandom yet, Season 3 is the season that will draw them in and will finally be the breaking point to get the show the fanbase it deserves. However, nothing can take away some of the early missteps in seasons 1 and 2, and the question remains as to if the production team can keep the quality up for a season 4 and possibly season 5 or more. If it can, then Ozark still has the potential to be considered with some of the greats. Can't say the show as a whole is a masterpiece yet (since even to bring the word up entails a "finished" product and there are still more seasons left to tell the story), but season 3 is definitely "Great".<br/><br/>Season 3:<br/><br/>9/10 I loved breaking bad don't get me wrong, but there was only one really great character which was Walt. This series has the same high calibre of writing but also almost every character has an awesome depth to them, and a darkness, a definite darkness. Thoroughly enjoyed all three series and can't wait for more. I really liked the show, but why is that *they*, the writers and producers, have to always be so anti-Christ,. Every other sentence is Jesus Fn and it's really sad. It really lends zero to the plot. Not sure how they even consider to compare this to Breaking Bad, Drawn our plot with no element of surprise at any stage. Bateman is woeful playing the role with no charisma and a complete dead pan bore. Only characters with true depth are the Snells.... Each episode is a surge of anxiety and hate. God I can't stand the women in this series, unpredictable and irritating. Well that why I like it too I guess. Come to think about it passed Beldech test in another level. Ok, so I jumped on this bandwagon late so watched all 3 series back to back. I loved the first 2, well paced, surprises, great acting. The third lost me. Half way through I kind of wanted it to be over! Waaaaay too much Wendy and her character is unbearable! She is in every scene and is always making stupid decisions she thinks are smart and making that stupid patronizing expression. Nowhere near enough screentime for Ruth, meanwhile they made Ben out to be really likeable then turned him into a mentally disabled child? I totally understand the concept of mental illness and the acting was good, but he was mentally ill not mentally disabled. Then this woman just leaves him to get killed? Totally lost sight of the whole point of the series and got distracted by a side story. I dont often watch tv series, because most of them simply s**k, not this one though. Ozark SEASON 1 is definitely something else. It is not perfect, some episodes (in the middle, 4-7) are a bit boring sometimes and somewhat superfluous at moments, but especially the first three and the last three episodes (most of them directed by Jason Bateman himself) are almost equal to a movie, in scope of drama and thrill.<br/><br/>The good: LOTS. Jason Bateman directed AND acted AND produced this movie, among others. The episodes he directed himself though are thrilling. Acting, script, photography are just terrific. SEASON 1 is the best. Many reviewers have mentioned (rightfully so) that season 2 and season 3 are inferior. And they are...<br/><br/>Any bad? During the middle episodes (ep. 4-7) lots of superfluous supporting characters get way too much screen time. I suspect this is due to Netflix policy of "timeslots". There has to be an exact number of episodes/hours that has to be created, even after having produced the series it would have been better (less boring) if they would have cut 2 or 3 episodes out of it.<br/><br/>The story; it may sounds a bit ridiculous that a normal father suddenly becomes a big drugs dealer, but because of the great acting performances and the good screenplay, this story still stays credible. It is (mostly) a fascinating AND thrilling storyline! Wow, where do I even start?<br/><br/>First, let's begin with the accolades. Ozark is a great show, if you are thinking about watching it, I recommend that you do.<br/><br/>Let's start with the Praise:<br/><br/>This series has amazing cinematography, the scenes are filmed in a very artistic way. The acting is phenomenal, if you do not like one character you will like another. Whether you love or hate a character, the acting is the reason. The show is full of suspense. Ozark is a very binge-worthy show, you will be at the edge of your seat watching episode after episode. Each episode leaves the viewer wanting more. The show is very emotion-inducing. This series will leave you in tears, laughing, scared, angry, etc. due to the plot and acting.<br/><br/>
Now for the criticisms:<br/><br/>Can be a little filler-ish - Sometimes a story that takes up an entire episode could have been done in half the time. The show sometimes drags out the scenes, I don't know if it is to make sure they hit 10 episodes or what, but season 3 could have been done within 8 episodes without compromising anything, but if you prefer quantity it isn't a problem.<br/><br/>Too many plot conveniences - The best kinds of shows are the ones that do not remind you that they are shows. Some aspects of this show can be unrealistic including: Wendy somehow figuring out Marty's laptop password, Wendy knowing where the Chicago family hides their keys, The wife of the casino owner dying a freak death so that the Byrdes can buy the casino (yeah, right), Wendy being able to talk her way out of anything, like being able to talk a police officer out of searching her car. Some things are unrealistic and they happen because of "plot armor" and "plot convenience".<br/><br/>Sometimes a bit too dark - Part of the artistic angle of the film is that every episode has a filter that makes all of the scenes dark and gritty. During night time scenes it is difficult to see, which would make the series best to watch at night.<br/><br/>Wendy becomes insufferable and Marty becomes a weak pushover - A lot of people complain about the title characters and Wendy Byrde (played by Laura Linney) becomes a character that viewers love to hate, may people draw parallels between Wendy and Skyler from "Breaking Bad". At one point, the show turned Wendy into a mustache-twirling villain, not too far off from "Game of Thrones's" Cersei Lannister.<br/><br/>Wendy starts off the series having an affair and trying to run off with Marty's (Jason Bateman) money. The family are mandated by the Cartel to move to the Ozarks and Wendy and Marty are together as "a business relationship" and are very cold toward one another. The couple seem to work out their differences for a while until Wendy screws the family over by getting them deeper into the life of crime because she gets a thrill off of the ambition.<br/><br/>Throughout the series, Wendy continues to make all sorts of decisions behind Marty's back, including buying a casino and keeping her brother at the house despite Marty's wishes and ultimately has to call a hit on her own brother. All the while Marty takes a backseat while Wendy calls all of the shots. In every scene Marty walks around like a powerless child crying to his wife "you made a decision without me?" over and over again.<br/><br/>Then Marty goes from frustrated about Wendy's decisions to inexplicably saying she's right about everything. Marty told Wendy it wasn't her fault that she was having an affair while he worked, Marty said Wendy was right to force the family to stay in the Ozarks and keep them cemented in the organized crime game, Marty absolves Wendy of responsibility after every screw up and appears like a spineless coward in contrast to her "boss lady" persona.<br/><br/>Marty plays the pushover, husband that is all too common with television shows nowadays.<br/><br/>In spite of these flaws, Ozark remains a top notch show. Absolutely loved this season and love this cast. It's SO good! A must watch. Ozark continues to prove why it's one of Netflix's very best shows. Great mix of characters, story, and acting. Drama, suspense and thriller, all mixed in a proper manner. Just keeps getting better! Brilliant show from start to finish.Drama, thriller, action all rolled into one show. Jason Bateman is brilliant as always. Great cast, great scenery, great story-line. Highly recommended viewing. The Byrdes are always a step ahead even when you think they're screwed.
I just finished all 3 seasons and I am already hanging out for season 4.
Bateman is someone you can't help but love for how well he plays his character with how much he loves his family.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this if you're into binge watching or have time to kill in ISO! Great story line but hate that it's so dark visually. One of the best series I've ever watched.Season 3 was breathtaking and it really kept me captivated through the whole season.Spectacular work! I think if you have been around over half a century and watched enough crime dramas they all get to be pretty much the same. Ozarks is entertaining but most of the characters are over the top stereotypical which makes the show turn the corner from serious to mostly comical. I'm gonna keep this short and sweet. If you're not watching Ozark yet, get on it as soon as possible. Season 3 is the best YET. Tom Pelphreys performance is OUTSTANDING! This is an awesome tv series can't wait for the next season There are 3 seasons till now. Starting with the 1st season it's majorly a super fast car which transport you to normal life to a Dark Zone of "Ozark".<br/><br/>In season 2 speed is on Top Gear and you will see the transformation of many characters. Ending of this season will be a catch for you.<br/><br/>In season 3 you will see everything is messed up pace is bit slow. You will say, where it's going But in the end "Surprise! Surprise!". You will crave for season 4. Beautiful series of characters great subject beautiful places good we need such series I recommend to everyone I'm waiting for 4 seasons Great show. Definitely adults only. Suspenseful and entertaining. Please in the next season let "Darlene snall" be the godfather of this series...we need more Mafia style vs macxican cartel mob!! No more blablabla...let the action begins... Came upon this Series late, (Season 1 viewed) it's good in so many parts the virtues are difficult to recount in sensible order, with faults so few and fleeting, they're just plain irrelevant. Love the brutal frankness how the nitty gritty of contemporary life is presented warts and all, where the corrupt, human soul redefines good and bad along its own irrational John Wick-inspired axis, with swamp creatures lurking under every stone. If you like the "good people doing bad things" genre you might like this. It's getting old for me and, to be honest, these aren't really good people to begin with. Marty was crooked from the outset, the cheating wife new it and their only compassion is for themselves.
I'm bailing early into the 1st season finale. I see that it's an hour and 20 minutes long and I don't care enough to find out how it ends.
Nothing against any of the actors. They are all really accomplished and deliver fine performances. It's just that there's no one here to root for, so to speak. Just another show with killers and drug dealers and one more dire circumstance after another. I'm tired of rabbit holes.<br/><br/>Addendum: The way I rate shows...
I don't usually review anything less than a 7 because 6 would be a failing grade and I won't waste my time watching it. I'm old; I don't know how much time I've got left. Since I probably turned it off before getting even halfway through, it wouldn't be fair to rate or review it.
7 is watchable but I may go a while between episodes since, though somewhat entertaining, there are other shows more interesting or compelling.
8 would be a regular in my lineup.
9 is a must see and probably bingeable.
10 is just the epitome of superbity and headed for my all-time favorites list.
I'm adding this to my reviews because it seems there are a lot of binary reactions to pretty much everything these days. I am not a like/unlike kind of guy. I see a lot of grays so if I give something a 10 it doesn't mean the only alternative is a 1. I'm not sure how I feel about Season two of Ozark. I never wanted to turn it off. The acting is great. However, I'm trying to figure out where it went in year two. Seems like little progress was made. The pace was slow and the episodes were not tight. Soo, unlike the other 1 star reviewers I don't think Netflix is trying to "push the liberhul agenduh!!!" on us with this show. I just think this show is extremely boring and dull.<br/><br/>Firstly, everything is tinted blue. Why? Are they just forcing the "dark and gritty" effect to try to make it dark and gritty? Because it's not. Nothing happens in any episode that makes you want to quickly watch the next one. "Oh no we have to work for these drug dealers or theyll kill my family oh noo lets do nothing but sit in this cabin all day and breathe heavily at eachother with grumpy faces"<br/><br/>Secondly, the gay cop(s) and the redneck. First I want to mention I'm gay myself. Secondly. I just want to ask.. why? Yea, another why. See, I don't think that Netflix is doing this to make the right clutch their pearls and get offended. I think they just pushed it in there just so people will go "Ooo ahhhh gasp! gay people!". The fact that they're gay has literally NOTHING to do with the story. It's a completely unecessary subplot. The feds are supposed to be there to track down suspects. Why is he making out with trailer trash? Why do we need to watch them have sex? Again, completely pointless.<br/><br/>In conclusion. There is no intensity. No "gripping" storytelling. It's a boring Narcos/Breaking Bad wanna-be. I hope Netflix cancels it or somehow dramatically improves it. Their money could be better used working on something else that is actually interesting. I love Jason Bateman and wanted it to be good. Oh well. This is great series from Netflix. I am very happy. Please watch it, this show is not boring. It's one of the most finely written and executed show ever. Jason Bateman and crew is on firee with this!! There are two main points that I like this play. One is the consumption view: the money that should be spent must not be saved, and the money that should not be wasted cannot be spent at all. The second is don't want to share trouble with others ridicule difficulties, mature point to find a way to solve. This is by no means a bad show, but as with many tv shows it gets rated too high because of all the 10 clickers, who rate after the pilot episode or after season 1 to get another season, and doesn't bother to update their ratings if a show falters. I'm annoyed that I can't watch this on my laptop or phone, since it's filmed in almost perpetual darkness, so at best I can see shadows moving around and listen to voices for about 50% or more of any given episode. I guess this is supposed to give an artistic and gloomy feel, but for me it's just something that irritates me. I also guess that there's now (late season 2 for me), just too many writers, who wants to put their own spin on the story, which leads to inconsistencies in character motivation and previously established behavior without any relevant explanation for the changes, other than sloppy writing. This gets a bit tiresome, and I find myself noticing irregular behavior in a character, just to find it completely different or reversed in the next episode. I guess this would be fine if every character was bipolar, but that's just not the case.<br/><br/>First season was a strong 7 or even an eight for me, but now I'm down to a low 6. I still enjoy it, but I find myself increasingly doing other stuff whilst the show runs in the background, since nothing noteworthy happens for long durations of time besides characters sitting around whining.<br/><br/>Maybe it's time to wrap this show up now before it turns into a complete mess. This is not a masterpiece like "the sopranos" or "the wire". This show is absolutely mind blowing, it's entertaining as hell, and keeps you wanting to see more, i love the fact that it gives you a little bit of everything comedy, action, suspence, and romance. I love all the actors and actresses, overall this is a great show. Everyone in this season doing there marvelous performance. Season three is incredible. The entire cast were amazing. The writing is top notch. Ben's character in particular deserves special recognition. Can't wait for season 4. Season 3 takes the snow to a different level.. Amazed to know Hero is directing some of the episodes as well Just finished season 3 and wow it was brilliant! I remember binging the first season in a day because I loved it that much.<br/><br/>There are plenty of twists and turns with this and there is never a dull moment so your always glued to the screen Need new socks after this one.<br/><br/>Where breaking bad needed a few seasons (big fan!). This one knocks 'm out of the park after 3 seasons. This is not a review - it's a recommendation. Must watch. Ranks (almost) right up there with GOT and Breaking Bad. You won't be disappointed. Fills a void left by Breaking Bad's end. Season three has palpable dread and cliffhangers that are irresistible. Although major plot twists are predictable early on in the episodes, the writing, acting and general feel of the show are fantastic. Jason Bateman rocks in this one. We don't know if we should love him or hate him. Overall, great show! Just a wonderful show in all respects. Definitely worth your time! Exciting from the beginning, the business of drug money laundering brings about problems with the business, the Law and the family and these series exploit these subject from several corners. Although it has some non important loose ends, the plot is in general consistent, main actors and Ruth performances are great - they are multidimensional- and the way the script courses along is gripping. These series have steadily improved all the way up from the first season. Awaiting the fourth This show has become one of my favorites. The writing is great and the acting is superb. I just finished season 3 and in my opinion it was A lot better than season 2. What a wonderful series. Extremely entertaining and full of really good performances. The always dependable Jason Bateman has hit a home run with Ozark. Has all the elements of a great suspense/crime drama. A little "breaking bad"esque as far as the premise, but fairly original story telling. Just finished season 3 and it may have been best season yet. Actually kinda wish Netflix would release its better new shows 1 at a time like hbo to give me something to look forward to watching for 10 weeks, instead of allowing me to just blow through in a few days. Now I've gotta wait a full 52 weeks minimum until season 4. And I will be waiting for the return of this fine show. Starts slow, but bare with it. It ends up really exploding. So psyched to watch s3 wooo! Really needed this while being in lockdown √∞≈∏Àú‚Ä¶ Plot and story started very well. It really drew me in. However it feels like the writers didn't think the show would last as long as it did. This family would have been killed off before season one ended in real life. But they somehow get a pass on death. The second season of Ozark starts out strong. It continues on with the intriguing storylines it set up last season for the first six episodes, but as the show chugs along into the second half of the season it becomes clear that the writers weren't exactly sure how to drag this season's storylines out to 10 episodes, and the pacing and entertainment level of the show suffer as a result. I loved the first season of this show. But like many American shows instead of writing better scripts they resort to over the top garbage that becomes impossible to believe. The death count also dramatically rises as if the producers think dramatic deaths will equal compelling viewing.<br/><br/>Hope they try harder for season three. Better watch something else. The main character is too cold and too smart in every situation. The story it's not believable.
Rambo was loks like a grand ma compared to Marty ( the main caracther a financial advisor ). I was into the first couple seasons but not sucked in. The story was definitely dark and compelling. But the writers definitely went back the the drawing board for the 3rd season and injected some serious crazy. It's one of the most wild rides I've been on with a series. As much as I hate to say it, this show is full of recycled ideas. It is like Breaking Bad all over again but not as good. Couple that with obvious Hollywood propaganda and it all adds up to just another attempt to recycle and influence. I hate to say that because I'm a huge Jason Bateman fan and there are some good actors/actresses in this series. There are also some really bad ones. Jason Butler Harner is dry and just plain awful in this one. I wanted to like it and did enjoy the first couple of episodes but it went downhill from there. BUMMED!!! I'm half way episode 9 just hope Helen kills em all in 10th episode First two seasons are akin to a Missouri based Breaking Bad. Season 3 gets it wrong by making the show all about Wendy Byrde. The show would be a 3/10 if it was just this season. I give the first two seasons 8/10 Yet another show ruined by writers trying to shoehorn in some ridiculous feminist narative. Suddenly the prinicple male characted is a total pushover, "eclipsed" by his wife. The show completely ignores the ridiculous decisions made by his wife and tried to convince us that she's a "strong women, who doesn't need a man". I'm so tired of good shows being ruined by this nonsense political agenda. People who vote this high are probably getting paid to do so. The amount of surreal, unrealistic and stupid stuff they put into this series is incredible. It could have even worked but if you look at season 2 episodes 8,9 and 10 you will understand why Ozark is overrated and irritating.
I could list dozens of nonsense they put in here it's a joke. Also 10 episodes of over an hour each just to make it as long as possible. When will producers and writers will understand that long doesn't mean good? Make one series of 6 episodes but make it good! This got lost with time; long and boring conversations and too much waste of time. I wouldn't watch a third series and I strongly recommend not watching this. Difficult to find great series nowadays, all about quantity not quality. This second "season" (and it's the usual year long wait between seasons) is slow and dark. And I mean, dark.
I understand that the subject matter is dark. The story is dark. However, the producers have made these episodes literally dark to watch. There is no color, no lighting. I found no artistic credit for this.
I won't watch the entire season. It has been done and the acting from some of the cast is less than stellar. It's hard to get into a series when there is not a single, likable character. You won't like anyone in this show 
I won't be watching the rest of the "season". Just end this horrible pile of crap. Bring new character out of sudden. Make it all about women when the show should be about laundering, cartels, drugs. Same old cliche of wife going against husband (breaking bad, house of cards). Whole lot storylines which are all terrible. I personally loved the first ten episodes. Some episodes felt long and almost forced but you're always compelled to stay. There are constantly twists and turns, Jason Bateman may have found his calling as an antihero. The show feels like a darker twist on concepts provided in breaking bad while still making them their own. <br/><br/>People reviewing after watching the first few episodes are in for a treat, the show does nothing but continue to build tension until an emotional climax in episode 10 that paves the way for season two. <br/><br/>Episode 10 alone makes this show a must watch in my opinion. Go see for yourself, you won't be disappointed. The show is well made and nicely stitched together but from the very beginning it shows complete lack of knowledge of the subject, the culture (not only Mexican but American as well). A drug cartel murders a skimming accountant who, as becomes clear from some pompous "Dirty Harry" dialogues, launders up to 200 million dollars a year for them? Over a 5 million dollar skim? The second surviving accountant explains that laudering money means taking cash in the US and delivering it to a foreign bank "that doesn't respond to IRS". SERIOUSLY? That's how you imagine the process? Some Mexican bandit who walks around in a leather jacket in 35C heat. A frugal mob money-launderer with a downtown Chicago office driving an old Camry... talk about conspicuous. A gay FBI agent who had a bad breakup with his own partner? This sounds suspiciously like Breaking bad wrapped in Weeds. Dubuque and Williams clawing for the unenviable laurels of Jenji Kohan. FAIL! As long as you stay very (and I mean VERY) focused on the current events on the screen, it looks okay... at times. But the second you start thinking about the whole story, it falls apart. It feels rushed, badly thought-through and clueless. This usually happens in season 8. Here we start with it. If you're not bothered by all that and just need a quick entertainment, go ahead and watch it. I'm surprised how a show with bad characters and no story is so popular. It's like build a 50 minute episode and add 30 seconds of plot right at the end. This review contains spoilers!<br/><br/>Jason Bateman's and Laura Linney's performances are superb in this show. There is no doubt about that. The first two episodes that Bateman directed were great and provided some level of entertainment.<br/><br/>However, the show went downhill after episode 2. Netflix and their producers/directors/writers went overboard with imagery. Netflix tried so hard to make the show edgy by giving its viewers sexually explicit scenes leaning heavily toward homosexuality. I understand some of the characters are gay. I don't need to be reminded every time with over-the-top scenes and unnecessary dialogue. On top of that, Netflix tries to make the show a racial matter. I give Ozark 1 star out of 10 because the scenes were forced and has nothing to do with the main story.<br/><br/>There are many other reasons why I give Ozark a 1 star rating.<br/><br/>-Characters are unlikeable.<br/><br/>*The main character has suicidal thoughts and does illegal activity for a living. He teaches his son how to do the illegal activity.<br/><br/>*His son defends illegal activity for economic purposes by arguing with a teacher in his classroom at school.<br/><br/>*The wife is a cheater and nags 24/7.<br/><br/>*An elder man is living in their own house who walks to the lake naked. The main character has 2 kids... (What the hell were the writers thinking?) <br/><br/>*An obsessed FBI agent who acts evil during homosexual acts. <br/><br/>*A priest allows illegal drug distributions during his speeches.<br/><br/>*Main Character's under-aged daughter gets involved in alcohol and sexual acts.<br/><br/>-The writers are inept.<br/><br/>I do not recommend this show. Ozark is better than Breaking Bad. Especially the third season. Jason Bateman has created something truly great, and unlike Breaking Bad, I don't roll my eyes and groan at most side characters. I love the tension, the escalation, the dramatic buildups and the atmosphere. It's by far the best show on Netflix. This 3rd season is awesome just gets better as it goes, OZARK so fking good! Another home run for Bateman and the crew. This series goes from strength to strength. With Stella acting and amazing storyline.
It's not to be missed. I never thought that every new season is greater than the last one!!! Top story and lovely acting by all of them. Great job Bateman!!! I compeare this tv series with always on top of all: Breaking Bad!!! Don't loose it... The best series I've ever seen in any genre. Only complaint is how long we have to wait for season 2. Just awesome. The acting is superb and the storyline is captivating. A must see. Jason Bateman is a great actor, however his character confuses me. I'm not sure if we are meant to like him or feel sorry for him because I don't. Also not sure if we are meant to like any of the characters. The show is a good watch, easy and entertaining, but it's very far- fetched. I mean what horrible parents, and the kids are OK with this?? It's definitely not the next Breaking Bad like others are saying. Don't expect a story-line as smart as that, however if you want something that is full of surprises and leaves you wondering what will happen next (no matter how nonsensical) then give it a go. Not sure if I'll give the second season a run. Decent show with unnecessary amounts of homosexuality shoehorned into the episodes. We get it. There are gay characters. It seems they keep bringing it up for no reason. It adds nothing to the story. This is a very dark, depressing, unrealistic, and disturbing show. I'm surprised Laura Linney took the role, but maybe she's envious of Anna Gunn.<br/><br/>Ozark is an extremely dark show, both figuratively and literally. The screen is always a bluish dark tint. This may be style, but it's also depressing. The sun never shines. Blah. <br/><br/>But the darkness doesn't end there. The characters are all depressing. They don't joke, they don't laugh, and they don't smile. <br/><br/>This isn't the main problem, though. The main problem is the seriousness with which the creators take the material. How about a joke or two? How about some personality?<br/><br/>This is a depressing show with nothing uplifting and no moral at the end. Even though it has its tense and thrilling shocks and moments, it comes across as more of an indie project for small time film festivals. <br/><br/>I'm not sure what Bateman is truly trying to say here. He took everything from Breaking Bad and just changed the location. The ripoff is so blatant and obvious, but with such far less talent and creativity. <br/><br/>While it has its thrilling moments, overall it's too dark. There's no higher purpose or moral to the story, no humor, and it's unrealistic. Still, compared to what's out there today, I'd say it holds its own as one of the more entertaining shows you can watch. Just don't expect to feel uplifted or happy afterwards.<br/><br/>7/10 Cant go past fourth episode. Uppity older ladies mumbling about business and crime whole the time, wtf is this? The plot had everything to be good, if it were not boring and tiring scenes. Not to mention that nowadays it is "fashion" to insert subjects that involves the politically correct like homosexuality and etc. What is the reason the FBI character is gay? Not to mention that it teaches money laundering. Netflix 10-part series, available all at once upon release.<br/><br/>Netflix has an undeniable presence in streaming content and they continue to contract for "direct to Netflix" content in movies and TV series. Naturally some are better than others.<br/><br/>I looked forward to "Ozark", I like the two leads, and in fact both of them are very good here. But the content isn't so good. There are no characters with redeeming qualities, everyone is cheating, everyone uses foul language continuously. All things that turn this show into an unsavory mess.<br/><br/>Jason Bateman is big-city money man Marty Byrde, he gets across a Mexican drug lord in a bad way, is almost killed point-blank, but in desperation suggests that he could establish a much more efficient money-laundering operation in remote Missouri, Lake of the Ozarks. He really had no plan, he had just heard of the location, but he was desperate. So far so good, a story with many possibilities.<br/><br/>His wife is Laura Linney as Wendy Byrde, they have two teenage children, a boy and a girl. They quickly sell their house and move to the Ozarks. Marty manages to come up with $8Million that he carries around in backpacks and suitcases. He has a very short time to come up with a plan.<br/><br/>When I read what I just wrote I think "That's a pretty good story" but actually seeing it just isn't very entertaining or fulfilling. All bad people out to steal from each other or kill each other, with none of the charm of shows like "Fargo" or "Better Call Saul." A big disappointment from Netflix. 1-2 was awesome<br/><br/>Season 3 it just for wendy and her brother<br/><br/>Dam!!!! The good:<br/><br/><ul><li>Season 1 and most of Season 2</li><li>The casino in Season 3 makes for a nice change of scenery</li><li>Ben dies</li></ul><br/><br/>The bad (season 3):<br/><br/><ul><li>The Marty and Wendy conflict has already been done to death and you simply can't milk more seasons out of it. It's boring and tedious to watch</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Having characters who are liars and manipulators only works in a show if there's one or two of them, balanced with mostly straight characters around them. Once almost every single character is going around deceiving, scheming and manipulating it loses any impact</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Ruth goes from rebuffing Ben to falling in love with him in the time it takes you to finish reading this sentence</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The mob boss is not at all convincing in the way he speaks, his motivations or his actions</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Tom Pelphrey and Laura Linney competing to see who can be the most annoying, hysterical and overacting member of the cast</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The focus shifts from Marty, even though he's the best character</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Wyatt and Darlene. No more needs to be said</li></ul> I think this season is the best of all seasons 'till now. Damn, a hell of a show and what an outstanding performance, especially from Wendy, Marty, Ruth, the rich Widow with the heroin plantage and the brother of Wendy in my opinion. Amazing show, good character building and tons of plot building Will season just be a little bit better? Haha it hardly can't be, but I sure hope so. Thanx people for this fine art.<br/><br/>Damn, have to wait at least another year......√∞≈∏Àú‚Ä¢ After such a promising first season, this show has become progressively more far fetched. I won't be specific in order to avoid ruining for others. But, Plot lines completely disregard common sense and reality. Unlikeable characters and ludicrous screenwriting. Jason Bateman and Julia Garner are amazing actors and really the only reason I kept watching through season two. Laura Linney is great at playing the worst mother and wife on earth with no moral compass but a holier than thou attitude. While the Skylar has really come into his own as a young actor Sophia Hublitz is just terrible and her character even worse. The writers have just lost their way and if they don't revamp the cast this show is dead in the water. It's okay as a story but I'm thinking for viewing they could have a lot more daylight in Missouri. Retitle it OH DARK! This series started well with a pretty gripping set up with an interesting scenario. Unfortunately, as it develops it just got so completely silly with its plot points and story lines that I just couldn't believe anyone could take on so many enemies along with the two key ones that and survive. I suppose the writing team was looking to make for Breaking Bad level intensity but it just got so far fetched with the main character's complete inability to cover his tracks and to have such trust in the waitress who is a known crook along with her entire family it just got plainly silly. Wandering side stories with his kids that made little sense along with his wife's backstory that, in reality, would mean she would be a prime murder suspect in the death of her lover. This was just really silly, the writers should have simplified things and reduced the number of enemies and predicaments as it quickly reached a level of unbelievabilty. If the FBI were really this incompetent then America would have ended as a country decades ago. I loved the first episode, so much promise and intensity but as i went on watching and though it may have been nice, it was starting to bore me, especially since the show is one hour! and i will not tolerate a show that disrespects the Name of Jesus. If you're a true follower of Christ, do not watch this junk. I felt i must put it out there and defend the Name of He that saved me. I would have continued watching but DO NOT EVER disrespect Christ. An otherwise excellent first season is ruined by Laura Linney's over-acting, whining and squinting. Julia Garner is the awesome stand-out of this show. The second season is garbage, the third season is even worse. I was in search of a worthy show after I watched Br Ba which was a masterpiece though. I've even binged 1 season of Better Call Saul I personally didn't like it. I came across this show then . I gave this a try. My god this is the worthy successor to br ba.
Things I like about this show are
1. Fast Paced .
2. Best Direction.
3 . Best Acting.
4. Great plot.<br/><br/>
I personally like S2 more than s1 . I don't find any flaws. Buddy's death and character development of Wendy !.<br/><br/>S3 was a masterpiece tho. Death of Wendy's üò≠ bro. Man it touched me and Darlene character development. I absolutely love Ozark, definitely the best tv show I have ever watched.
I couldn't take my eyes off the screen and I became totally addicted. I found myself really engaged with the all characters and I was really rooting for them to succeed.
I Would recommend to everyone who loves a thrilling series with lots of edge of your seat moments!! I remember watching season 2 and being disappointed that it wasn't as good as season 1. I was worried season 3 would be even less entertaining and that the show would fizzle out. Boy, was I wrong. Season 3 from start to finish is absolutely fantastic.<br/><br/>I'm glad they got rid of the drama with Charlotte. I absolutely hate it when teens in shows become ultra irrational. Her whole emancipation plot line was a giant waste of screen time and she is far cooler acting as a responsible and understanding, almost adult.<br/><br/>I am however disappointed that they still went that route with her little brother. I really, really hope he doesn't turn into a whiny, depressed trouble maker next season. Show runners need to stop making kids into whiney, spoiled, depressed, annoying brats. A good example of an absolutely incredible show ruining a kid character like that is the sopranos with AJ.<br/><br/>I know they hinted at him having mental issues etc. But that better not be a big plotline next season is truly hate that. His abrupt change is also absurd. He barely knew his uncle and pretends like his dad just died. For the short time he did knew his uncle he must have noticed how off he was and then he also saw what he did at their charitable foundation party.<br/><br/>He goes from being the super smart, responsible but in many ways naive kid setting up shell companies etc to "I hate you mom! I can never forgive you for this" kid. I'm worried they'll make him act like a mix between his uncle Ben and Charlotte from season 2. The Ozark AJ, the kid with the mental issues constantly causing needless and uninteresting drama just for drama's sake.<br/><br/>Those types of plots aren't like by anyone. They are just annoying. If you want to use kids as a plot device do so in a good way. If they continued with his weird fascination for dead animals etc and his mental issues like that it would be ok. But he was acting like a relatively normal, nerdy, anxious teen this season, getting his first kiss etc and it was great. Then they kinda ruined it with how ultra emotional he got with his uncles ashes at the end. I can already see this being a big plot line next season and just, please don't. We have Ruth for that already.<br/><br/>With Ruth it makes a lot more sense because she was in love with him. But in the end the way she acted also made little sense. Ruth of all people should know how hard it is to have family that are unstable and a danger to themselves and the family as a whole. She killed her uncle and basically had a hand in her dad being killed. She knew he'd be back if it didnt happen. She should have understood Wendy esp after some of the stuff that Ben pulled.<br/><br/>Not to mention that she betrayed the Bird's by getting Ben out of the mental hospital and indirectly causing him to get killed and putting everyone's life's in danger. It's also weird that the Bird's forgive her for that and didn't get more angry over it. Instead she is the one pretending like she is right. Ruth should have chilled down a bit with her "I don't care" attitude, moved out of her trailer and gotten her and her baby cousin a proper home. Started behaving more respectful but she is still cursing at Marty and acting all wild Excellent show. Superb acting. Great storyline. üëçüëçüëç Season 3! Blew it out the park! Absolutely fantastic - best yet Jason Bateman and crew. Bring on Season 4. Utterly phenomenal! Brilliant writing, direction, acting..! All is connected yet each season is somehow better than the previous. Not for the faint; stressing. I moved my review of Ozark up from a 9 to a 10 after season 3! The acting is amazing and the storyline just keeps evolving and getting better. So many great characters and the last few episodes of this season had me on the edge of my seat. Unfortunately I watched it all too quickly so roll on season 4!
For anyone giving Ozark a go for the first time I will admit it took me a few episodes to get into it but my advice is to stick with it and you won't be disappointed. It caught me since the first season with that "breaking bad" feeling. Full of surprises and twists that makes you always curious of what's gonna happen now. Excellent plot, acting and characters development. S3 was mad!!! Can't wait for season 4. Hope they don't screw up to finish their story in the end üôè I have watched it from the beginning, and I have just watched episode 5 of series 3, it is excellent acting and a good script, well worth watching. Good characters, great story, but you just be calm. It takes long to develop the story, so if u like fast actions, dont watch it, but if you like a well developed story, have your shot. We LOVE this show just finished season 3 and I had to go back to season 1 to see this awesomeness all over again. Very creative story line. I agree with the relatively high score that this series gets if we are talking about Season 1 episodes 1-4. But then I found it to get more and more soap opera like - like they are dragging the story out. I stopped on episode 6. If you like a dark, well thought out thriller this is the one for you. It is probably the most realistic series I have ever watched. It portrays the lives of good people needing to be criminals. Great cast and Jason Bateman does is incredible. A financial adviser drags his family from Chicago to the Missouri Ozarks, where he must launder $500 million in five years to appease a drug boss. That's the plot and in the beginning I felt it was not original at all but after watching through the two first episodes I get to delve deep into the characters, seeing them develop with the help of some fantastic writing. Its ensemble cast is chosen carefully and everyone does an incredible job at portraying them in a believable and great way. Jason Bateman, Julia Garner, Laura Linney, Peter Mullan and Lisa Emery stands out the most, bringing some of the best performances on television in the two years it aired. It's such a great show thanks to the cast and production team.<br/><br/>How every scene flows together into one beautiful sequence is something that other filmmakers should do more as its more immersive and beautiful to look at. The help of the show being set in Ozark and being filmed there makes for some stunning shots and locations. Cinematography is incredible. The music and sound department is perfect, the suspenseful music sets the mood of the show, bringing sounds that I found unique and original but unexpected made for some of the best suspension music I've heard.
I recommend the show to everyone that likes the crime/thriller genre and a likeness to character driven dramas with superb acting. It started off strange but intriguing, Season 1 was good but Season 2 was even better and can't wait for Season 3. Good on you Bateman! This unintended comedy comes wrapped in a slow moving, boring-as-hell (melo)drama. The comic highlights are in the plot flaws, glaring continuity errors and Jason Bateman and Co's lacklustre acting. Works as a great cure for insomnia or aspirational vehicle for rednecks perhaps? Started with a promise, then got unwatchable because of annoying unlikable characters and lethargic "who gives a crap" storytelling. How people think Jason Bateman's acting's good I'll never know. He's as interesting to watch as paint drying and you care about the character about as much. Then again people liked Game Night, so I guess anything is possible. The rest of the cast do a decent job, but that doesn't help much when you have no interest in their characters. Honestly, I tried so hard to like this and there were moments where I did but they were so few and far between. I watched this show through to the end of season 1 and really have no desire to watch a second season. I found all the characters to be unlikeable which is really hard to watch a show when you're not cheering for anyone. It really is the ugly stepchild to breaking bad unfortunately. Not to say many viewers will love this show and find it extremely entertaining but i'm not one of them. I think that viewers times are better spent watching other Netflix original series or branching to HBO. I would say this show is worth a watch but if you don't enjoy the first couple episodes you most likely will not enjoy the show. I am having to force myself to watch this after the 3rd episode, simply because a reviewer said it gets better at the end of the first season. There are too many flaws in the plots and writing to mention, but you can look them all up by simply checking out the bad reviews. The fact that this got a higher rating here than Animal Kingdom, which is light years better, can only be attributable to the audience availability. Animal Kingdom is on TNT, which has a completely different and far more limited audience than Netflix. The rating on this would soar on Netflix, but unfortunately it has to depend on word of mouth and the cost on iTunes is costing me more, just for this show than Netflix full time. Just trying to frame my reasoning for why the rating on this show is skewed higher than it should be. However I will give it a 7, based on the actors having to make the best of sub par writing. They are still interesting to watch, if you can dismiss the multiple implausible plot lines. The overall story is fine, but the plot holes and poorly concieved character motives ruin everything. 1 star for making a series. 0 stars for babbling nonsense for 10 hours straight couldnt understand a thing. The cube headed stonegazed chirpy voiced lead actor was a pain to endure. And the annoying squinting grammy faced actress was bad too. Enjoyed watching some good nature film of lakes and wood but too often bad acting and spoiled writing trash the experience. I was conflicted. I was enjoying the story and cinematography. But they basically turned every person in the Ozark into a racist, sexist, etc. I'm so sick of political agenda getting in the way of entertainment/art. I'm from the Ozark. I actually know this people very well. None of them are openly racist or sexist as this show would imply. They aren't dumb as this show would have you believe. Of course Jason Bateman and Laura Linney are portrayed as humans herding cavemen. But I went to Columbia University and other people from my town went on to decent colleges as well. Let's just all be more conscious about how we portray people. This sort of stuff demonizes great people. This series deserves a much higher rating than am 8.4!! I was the biggest Breaking Bad fan, but I honestly believe this beats it. Jason Bateman is freaking OUTSTANDING!!!! The characters made me dislike this series. Wendy character is the ugliest version a woman can be. She has no ethics or self esteem. She respects no one and becomes violent when she doesn't get what her pathetic subconscious needs. Screams throughout the whole series. She's schizophrenic af. It's just too much drama. Please kill that btch for the sake of poor Marty. Watching the last season and it's still boring and full of stupid family fights. Comparing Ozark with Breaking Bad is like comparing The Irishman to Citizen Kane: Boring plot, bad acting, no suspense at all - see Bateman's kidnapping by a cartel head... A poor farce! - ... And it's quite insulting for Bryan Cranston and the whole Breaking Bad's Crew! Ozark is the perfect tv show....great story, great actors, great screenplay, great directing, great intensity, great entertainment.
You're left wondering how you could find under the same umbrella (Netflix) miserable products such as Toy Boy or, even worse, Money Heist....
Lack of content....? More characters,more action awesome the writing is amazing a lot better than season 1 and 2 Yes, there is a suspense in this show, and a cast is decent. But to me, the show has much uneasiness and agitation in it, that brings anxiety. You know that there is no hope, no future for this family. You watch the kids of this family, and you feel a lack of hope, and you know that only the worst will happen to them. I mean, only SAD things happen in the show. It's boring, that's all it is. The characters are unappearling and start bugging very fast. All the people describing this show as intense and thrilling probably never watched any decent movie before. I thought the plot was very promissing, but it gets boring really fast. Looks like there are no decent screen play writers anymore, or the studios are to cheap to pay a good writer. The thing that kills this show is there's too many side plots. Every character has a story. Sounds good, but the writers want this to be Breaking Bad so hard! Same here! I really wanted to like this show!! The reason Breaking Bad was good was due to the chemistry (seriously no pun intended) between the two main characters. This show is diluted in character development; as in too many charters' personal stories. I'm partially through the 5th episode and decided I'd rather write this than continue watching. Nothing really original about this show, if you liked breaking bad, this show is essentially a lesser version of such with not as strong a plot. Not to say it wasn't entertaining, but cant hold a candle to breaking bad. I got through 10 episodes before stopping though because i couldnt take the cheesy progressive agenda scenes. Theres basically a monolog about how great obama was, and pro abortion scene (basically a Middle class woman nonchalantly talking about aborting her baby due to inconvience), and a beyond cheesy anti-gun scene. The political agenda is so thinly veiled And cheesy that it takes away from enjoyment from the story if you are someone who has any "right" stances politically. Hits on all cylinders!!!<br/><br/>With so many quality shows falling apart (Westworld, Better Call Saul and Outlander to name a few), thankfully this show didn't disappoint.<br/><br/>The last 2 episodes are especially incredible! If you don't have 30 hours to watch this over the course of three days then don't even bother starting. Once you start you will not want to finish until you were done with the 30th episode. It's that good! Jason Bateman u beauty! But i think Ruth steals the show. She is absolutely brilliant. Someone give her a Golden Globe or Oscar. I love Ozark Seasons 1 and 2. I like season 3 but Wendy (as other reviewers have said) is on the screen too much. I noticed them working it from season 2. She's like a boss (leader) now Jason Bateman is becoming more toothless. Wendy comes out on top. Enough already! I think my sister and I finished this all three seasons in like a week. We could not go to sleep because we rather finish the next episode. We loved everything about this show! Its thrilling and keeps you on your toes. Must watch! This is one rare example of how a tv series actually improves as the seasons progress! Amazing third season and even with a final bang! Keep it up! This show is good; however, the bratty and really disrespectful teenagers make it hard to watch at times. Charlotte is a very hard pill to swallow. Also, the brother and sister are only supposed to be 1yr apart but they look there's a 5 yr difference between them. I already liked season 1 but season 2 and 3 have been in a whole other league the tension is ramped up to another level and the character arcs individually are fantastic also their isn't a member of the cast that lets it down at any moment! Already so excited for season 4 after a perfectly dramatic ending to season 3 one of my favourite series of all time to date! Season 3 is brilliant, from beginning to end. Can't wait for season 4. Thank for the great work. Julia (Ruth) and Laura (Wendy) are putting on some of the best performances on TV right now. Bateman's not bad himself. And then folks like Tom Pelphrey show up from time to time and put on acting clinics.<br/><br/>All in all this is one of my favorite shows, and season 3 was pure gold. Season 3 of Ozark was for me probably most anticipated series of all time. And it was worth it. Old/new characters did perfectly blend in the new season making it as good as previous seasons. On first, I was somewhat skeptical about Tom Pelphrey (Ben Davis) and his contribution to the new season, but I was very wrong. Jason Bateman's recent producing work - Ozark and the HBO's The Outisider really gives something to look forward to in the future. It would be interesting to know if the show creators were actually reaching for the depth and quality that the show provides. Bateman might look like he's underplaying the role but I think it's just right. "Ruth" character is amazing and will be up there with the Fonz and Spock as far as establishing a predictable and memorable character. Certainly a plot with new twists. Some reviewers have wondered why this series is not higher rated. For two reasons: first, it is targeted at post teenage viewers. The majority of reviewers on IMDB are teenage to 29. This series will appeal to a broad age group, but not so much to younger viewers who have been weened on faster-pacing, teen idols and more action. Exceptions of course, but the 30+ demographic will embrace the slower moving, character driven mature content.<br/><br/>The second reason is content and language. This series is about the trivials of laundering money for a drug cartel... a story around one of the worst aspects of real life in America doesn't appeal to all viewers. Additionally, the strong language used by many characters can also put off some viewers.<br/><br/>In the end the 8.5 to 9 rating which I feel is warranted is pulled down by a demographic expecting a different take. After 2 great seasons!! But season 3 I couldn't even get through episode 1 another show turned into a women power agenda!! To much boring dialogue and Laura Linney is taking way to much space The TV series is so fascinating that the audience would enjoy the rawness of the mundane and still be threatened by the undercurrent of the Mafia and the money sharks. It's not one you see in daily living. If one had alot of money, you would flaunt. But this isn't. It's about survival. Almost like living on the edge, meaning being a criminal and a saint simultaneously I'm not sure how I feel about Season two of Ozark. I never wanted to turn it off. The acting is great. However, I'm trying to figure out where it went in year two. Seems like little progress was made. The pace was slow and the episodes were not tight. I still enjoyed but Netflix is about content and not quality. The daughter has to be an idiot and Marty has to just be the biggest soft thing in the world.. That doesn't speak and accepts everyone for their word.. As a criminal he is horrible, as a father he is an idiot, and as a husband he's a softy.. ...of the worst tv series, ever.<br/><br/>I don't care writing reviews but i started to watch this because of its rating, 8.4.
If this one gets 8.4/10 then what would "the wire" or "true detective" or "fargo" or "breakin bad" or "narcos" score? 20/10?
The script is totally unreal, causes and effects seem to come out of a 10-year old writer and the characters are totally inconsistent.
There are dozens of other tv series out there that truly deliver. This one doesn't. At all. This show must go on, it's just great! I am even not using fast forward! First saw the trailer.. I thought wow!! I got new version of breaking bad on Netflix but after 4 episodes.. I felt really disappointed!! First of all one has to know all about money laundering to watch this and second I have to make sense out of every dialogue that has been said .. come on why can't they keep it simple ?? It s like trying to be over smart writer No wonder Netflix bought this series otherwise HBO could have made millions out of it Jason Bootman / Marty Brydestein = Tony Soprano, Walter White, Vic Mackey, Saul Goodman.<br/><br/>Laury Lindsay / Windy Brydestein = Skylar White, Carmela Soprano<br/><br/>Sofie Hubble / Sharla Brydestein = Typical Disrespectful Teenage "Brunt" <br/><br/>Skyward Gardner / Johnny Brydestein = Wednesday Addams, Lydia Deetz<br/><br/>Julie Garter / Ruth of Moab = Jesse Pinkman<br/><br/>Esai Morales / Del Tucco = Drug Lord Middle Manager impersonating Dos Equis' "Most Interesting Man in the World".<br/><br/>Harris Yulin / Buddy Dickler = George Wilson, Melvin Udall, Archie Bunker (Most Underutilized Character).<br/><br/>Evan George Vourazeris / Tuck = Charming Weetodd<br/><br/>Jason Butler Harner / Agent Pity = Windom Earle<br/><br/>Peter Mullan / Jacob Snell = Benjamin Horne<br/><br/>If you've read this far congratulations, you may need to google some of my character references. <br/><br/>If you've never seen a cable TV Drama, you may think this is a great project. However, if you've been watching TV since the early 90's, you may think this is a thinly disguised composite remake of the most the most successful, and loved TV characters from the past three decades. <br/><br/>Characters, omitted from the above list add little to the story, and are forgettable. 
The worst is McKinley Belcher III / Agent Trevor Evans (Gay Dark Chocolate). No disrespect to the man, but his character, and written dialogue are so cliche, and predictable, I skipped all but his first scene, and was able to deduce what was said by watching the next few scenes. <br/><br/>The two most interesting things about the whole show for me, are the "Ozark location itself" and the lake people played by all the extras. The "extras" look like they're played by actual resident of the area, that have never acted on screen before, similar to Clint's extras in Gran Torino.<br/><br/>The most disappointing thing about the show for me, is the underutilization the great, great Harris Yulin. There are two key scenes, where drama is unfolding in the Byrde house that were missed opportunities, where Buddy could have interjected, and added infinite wisdom, and humor. Instead, we get reenactments of Wilford Brimley skinny dipping in Cocoon.<br/><br/>My favorite part is when the foul mouthed brunt decides to commit. I was less than enchanted when she changed her mind at the last moment. I guess I'll watch season two, and you better believe I'm hoping her character dies. Let's just be honest. Ozark is no Breaking Bad. It tries to be. It tries extremely hard to be that and Fargo as well but in the end the writing is just not up to par. Too many times things just don't make sense. Like in a scene where the wife is trying to get into her husband's computer. She tries to guess a password once, twice, and then she looks at an envelope with some typewritten numbers on it and then suddenly she guesses his password on the third try. Huh? What? How? Doesn't make a lick of sense. This is just one tiny example of the many things in this show that just don't make sense. And that was the thing with Breaking Bad. Everything did make sense. I'd challenge anyone to find something in that writing that was too implausible or incongruous. Too many times in Ozark did I shout out loud, "That makes no sense!!"<br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong. This isn't a horrible show. It isn't written as poorly as 24 Legacy was. But it is nowhere near Breaking Bad status so just stop it already. One gets the feeling that the writers of this show really didn't know anything about or even research properly the subject matter they were tackling. Really? You have to put drug dollars into the dryer to make them look used? Where do you think drug money comes from? From the streets. From drug deals large and small. They don't come from the Federal Reserve handing out pristine, crisp bills with numbers all in unison. And some jerk throws the daughter off a boat, nearly kills her, sets her up to take the fall for stealing the boat. But a few episodes later, she's hanging out with him on the roof of his trailer. What? Why? Doesn't make a lick of sense.<br/><br/>Jason Bateman is being Jason Bateman throughout the entire thing. He's not even acting. He's just doing his Jason Bateman schtick. It worked in The Gift and it works for the most part here, but please, don't compare it to Bryan Cranston's stellar, multi-layered performance in Breaking Bad. It doesn't even come close. His character Marty Byrde never really gets a chance to be fully developed. We get the sense that Byrde has a talent to talk his way out of anything, but there are too many times where the only reason he actually got out of the situation he was in was because that's how the screenplay was written. And why he did half of what he did regarding the heroin kingpins--well that left me scratching my head. At one point the preacher puts a cross on top of the partially built church and that meant Marty was forced to give the Smells hundreds of thousands of dollars? Huh? Why? Doesn't make a lick of sense.<br/><br/>This show tries really hard to be Breaking Bad or Fargo and as a result it misses the opportunity to be itself. Once again, this isn't the worst television out there, so hopefully in season two it will find it's own groove and stop trying to be what it's not. But, no, it's not a ten, not a nine, not even an eight. It's a six and at least that's not a five. This series suffers from the same issue as Mr Mercedes and The Outsider. There simply is not enough material for 10 episodes so is filled with long pointless scenes that don't move the storyline along at all. I'd probably rate it at about 6 if it were only say 5 episodes as none of the characters are likable and the weird dark filter on the camera makes it a dull watch. I struggled through season 1, but will not be watching anymore. Terrible, unoriginal, predictable! Just stop talking, do something! Only blah-blah, blah, blah... endless bla-blah-blah. Nothing happens! First season was amazing, but this... no thnx! Its like "True detectives", the first was great, the second- piece of ... . This show is another terrible show from netflix. Terrible acting from terrible actors... Predictable or absolutely unrealistic. It wants to be 'breaking bad' so badly. Ozark reeks of trying to hard. The New York Time gave this show a mediocre review, but the fans seem to love it. It's an absolute must watch. It goes on the list. With the star power here, this must have cost Netflix a fortune; a lot went into it. Sure it might have some artistic flaws and bumps, but whatever - it has great acting, good action, shock value, great drama, suspense and an original story line. It's very entertaining and MOST definitely worth watching with no regrets. Hooked after the first episode. Can't wait until Season 2. To be clear: this had the ingredients to be a masterful crime series - fantastic cast, solid premise, and unique setting - but they made a broader soap-opera instead. Why? I don't know - maybe for mass appeal, or maybe they settled for what their writing talent could deliver. (Sopranos and Breaking Bad both had a twinge of contrived nonsense to keep our attention of course, but this doles it out in crack-addictive quantities.) You will find transient entertainment here for sure - hence the fans' zestful ratings - but there is no lasting mesmerization. Instead of making a gourmet extravaganza we would fondly recall in ten years, they served junk food we enjoy but will soon forget about. (There's nothing wrong with a good fast food dinner, unless you're expecting Filet Mignon. Cuz then you're gonna be disappointed. Which is why I'm warning you.)<br/><br/>The reason this is a soap opera instead of a crime drama is because you need to devote a maximum degree of suspending disbelief about the contrived action. On a meta-level, you have to accept that a Mexican drug cartel is omnipotent on American soil (so forget that El Chapo is just a ruthless buffoon in real life), that the police and FBI (until Maya) are basically incompetent at closing a case (even when at least 3 confidential informants have spilled the beans), and that the characters are momentarily upset about being kidnapped or having family members murdered but not affected long enough to stop it from happening over and over.<br/><br/>And then there's the family dynamic - granted, Sopranos and BB had their own dumb subplots involving the kids, but the Emancipation idiocy from season 2 was an excruciating viewer insult. (Season 2 in general is tedious - Good plot goal to expand the business, but 75% of the season is devoted to securing governmental approval-- #Yawn)<br/><br/>The last point is the writing is not-nuanced at all, probably because a soap-opera can't have too many "normal" supporting characters, otherwise the ludicrous action is too contrasted: everyone here has to be majorly flawed to avoid begging intelligent questions, so we get the array of lunatics and psychotics to propel the action. There is no Dr. Melfi (Sopranos) or DEA Brother-in-Law Hank (BB) for grounding. Season 1 had three discerning supporting roles (Buddy, Jacob, and Rachel), and no surprise they are all gone by season 3 as they were unsustainable in the burgeoning melodrama. But as a result of these writing choices there is also no satisfying depth from proven devices like foreshadowing or characters' moral growth arcs - it's all very superficial fluff from emotional manipulation. (I must stress the viewing can be very cathartic and extremely well performed at the same time -- if you get to season3-Ep9, the starting soliloquy by Ben and ending meltdown by Wendy are riveting.) Again - as long as you are expecting that type of genre, Enjoy!<br/><br/>I was going to write more contrasting this soap opera narrative with the more resonating reality of Sopranos/BB, and will append later with more detail if people like the review so far. If not, no worries. √∞≈∏Àú≈† U see a lot of talks of Money Heist but not so much one this. Wish more people knew about this series. I'm constantly promoting it to my friends! :) Highly recommend to anyone that haven't watch this. There is near-perfect balance in human nature, authenticity, drama, and three aspects.<br/><br/>Ozark is a real verson of breaking bad. Watched the first 2 seasons, enjoyed them, but didn't find them great,but entertaining. S03 on the other hand. Wow, this series has matured and it was excellent plus what a finale! Won't spoil. Glad this has turned into a high quality show. If Season one was packaging and Season two was delivery then Season 3 was the surprise moment. That Season finale literally had me saying 'Whoa. What.just.happened?! Reverse it!'
This season literally had no chill, even in its quieter moments - we rode along with the anger, the instability, the vunerableness and the erratically charged moments - I even teared up during one episode as I honestly felt Wendy's (Laura Linney) frustration, love and hopelessness for a family member's issues. Personal experience makes a heavy moment that much more emotional.
I love watching shows where you can see the effort each actor and actress puts into their character and how they all bounce off each other naturally - even the supporting cast members shone as brightly on screen as the main cast.
Ozark is one of those shows that just keeps getting better and better each season and I cannot wait to see what surprises Season 4 has in store for us. I'm s amazing how many loopholes there are in the system America was built on and this show just keeps pulling one punch after another......
This show is so good and funny, I'd take a punch ever day!
It puts the "balls" in Amazeballs!! This show is incredible in just about any area you can think of. Cast. Cinematography. Score. Plot. It has it all. The writing reminds me of Breaking Bad in a way. I love that it takes place in Missouri, we don't need anymore shows that take place in NY or LA. Jason Bateman and Laura Linney are experts in their craft and they put it on display during every episode of this show. The supporting cast knocks it out of the park as well. I couldn't ask for more out of a show and I am counting down the days until season 3. Is there a competition in films & tv series & the left generally to see how low and depraved you can get.
The gutter language and general behaviour in Ozark is very depressig. You seem intent to get children as young as is possible to use foul language.
In this (Ozark) series 2 there is relentless swearing and it's hard to understand how a sentence can possibly be completed without the 'f'word. 
I'm certainly no prude but it's so boring and tiresome. Is the talent of acting so bad that you think people can't possibly enjoy any films etc without it. Please try harder! Writers lost their way?
First 2 seasons were great and I waited eagerly, then 2 garbage storyline's filled up most of season 3.
Had great potential but I'm done. Awesome series, season 3 was terrific, best yet, Keep it up, make more! Such a damn good crime series that gives me anxious feelings and bliss! I really wanted Ozark to win golden globes the last couple years the acting is out of this world, great A entertainment. Quite a lot of business stuff that is well done and written; plus a fair amount of gritty violence that gives a nice suspenseful vibe especially for some of the main characters! I love the way Ozark was filmed, beautiful cinematography and captivating performances. Way too much into the explicit gay scenes (Obvious pandering), once I got over that I started to like Russel and then they immediately killed him as soon as they humanized him.
This isn't good writing by any stretch. Wendy is a Horrible woman not the strong woman any one wants, she's a self-righteous MURDER-MY-FAMILY because my intuition says I'm right, the same massive flaw we see in Weeds, terrible writing with a lot #Wahmen Power! You want both of the kids to die.... It's not a good show, everyone you like, they immediately kill and you only like them because lazy writing only develops them DIRECTLY before their death..... I knew the old guy was dying 30 minutes later, the second he was smiling in the Farm-machine.... I could pooh better than this. The writing is spot on, draws you in and holds your attention. You root for the underdog because Bateman is good at playing every-man. Then they start this love triangle with jazz hands -- sure it is disturbing and off-putting but yuck! Writing for the 1% will not get your show renewed. Then they have the preacher say GD?! What? Who are the writers who have never met a preacher? Maybe next season we can not focus on the weird love triangle that makes 99% of your audience turn away like the smell of a dead cow in the sun? Stick to the great writing and leave out the liberal yuck. Oh - and please let the mama be alive and well! Damn that is a great series. I wish I didn't watch it all in one day. I want more. Cheers to everyone involved in making this series. From creators, actors, directors just everyone. Well done. This series is one I tell everyone about and they are into it just as I. Great job Sex, drugs and violence? There's lots of that in Ozark. What could go wrong? Unfortunately, it's 2017 and not 2007. What could have been groundbreaking and shocking ten years ago proves to be rather stale and boring today. This show tries hard to emulate Breaking Bad, True Detective and Fargo. However, Ozark is nowhere near the level of these shows for a number of reasons and that's what makes it so disappointing. <br/><br/>Marty Byrde is a financial adviser in Chicago who is laundering money for a Mexican drug cartel. He is forced to uproot his life when it is discovered that his partner has been stealing from the cartel. Along the way we find out that he has a cheating wife, an obnoxious daughter and a weird son. The transition to the Ozarks doesn't go smoothly, as expected. You'd think this transition would be intriguing and exciting, but it's not. As the family settles in we meet more unlikable characters and some who are rather clich√É¬©. Tuck, a character with Down's Syndrome, is the most interesting character on the show to me. However, he really isn't given a big role in any of the episodes outside of occasionally acting as a gopher for the son. <br/><br/>There is a slight uptick in quality towards the end of the first season but not enough to save this show from being mediocre. The ending sets up for a continuation but I'm not sure I'll bother checking out any future seasons of this show because I simply do not care about what happens to anyone on it. My Up to date review of Ozark:<br/><br/>Ozark: A Thrilling story of corruption, lies, manipulation, politics, violence, drugs, blackmail, and family. All about the domino effect of engaging in dangerous and risky decisions and choices, and the personal dynamics between the family.<br/><br/>The first two seasons were pretty enjoyable. Thrilling, dark, powerful, but they never quite hit the level of potential I think the show has. There are moments where it does, but the first two seasons never really had quite the ultimate acceleration in theme, suspense, dialogue, acting, and writing, that I think it is capable of. However, I was throughly entertained and intrigued with the series. There were nice twists, turns, and shocking moments. some great performances, solid writing, including exchanges of witty and memorable dialogue, a great concept and atmosphere, plenty of different characters, all with distinctive styles. The directing and cinematography were also at times stellar. Characters you can root for, characters you hate, and the blurred line between good and evil, including the characters confronting their morals. As this is a series of constant betrayal and mistrust. Sure, the show bares a lot of blatant similarities to Breaking Bad, but I still think it has its unique style and substance. Where the show didn't meet it's full potential is with Jason Bateman's performance. He is solid, and it is saved by the many supporting characters, but Marty Byrde is not interesting or unique, and that is not made up for, because hes not threating or captivating either. The show uses more of its hillbilly powerhouses and the FBI as antagonists, then it does the actual cartel, which I do think is a unique quality.
Season 1: 7/10
Season 2: 7/10
So, I was expected that Season 3 would take the show to an Elite level, and that Jason Bateman and Laura Linney would step up, and that the addition of new characters and the presence of reoccurring ones, along with the new casino plot, making a great season.
But, Season 3 is a huge disappointment
It does find a consistent footing better than the previous seasons, but it proves to very lackluster. I'll start with the positives; There are scenes of great writing and explosive dialogue, as well some good direction and thrilling and suspenseful quality. Tom Pelphrey as Wendy's mentally ill brother (Ben), is great. He gives the best performance by far in this season. Now, the negatives; This season fails to interest, captivate, and expand by a huge margin. Its anti climatic, sometimes boring and drab, and does carry the Ozark shock moments as much as the previous seasons. There is a ton of story filler, as this season felt like a ticking time bomb that never explodes. Marty Byrde almost becomes a supporting character in this season, as he gets just one episode where he really has the spotlight, which is strange for the main character of the series. He takes a backseat, to Wendy, who takes the most screen time and narrative this season. She is focused on much more, and I just think it gets annoying. Laura Linney's Performance isnt bad, but she just not good enough to carry as much is put on her. This season felt like 10 Episodes that really could have been about 5 episodes, as it falls short of interesting content. Mainly, the Byrd's feel less in danger, which makes the series feel dragged out and unnecessary. I've read reviews stating that Ruth's character is repetitive and annoying, it makes sense, but I think Julia Garner gives a great perfomance and varies her character's emotions. Charlotte and Jonah are ridiculous. The amount of boring and cliche emotional and social filler that is put into them this season is unnecessary. The shift in roles made the show somewhat different, as Wendy taking over, made Marty feel non-existent sometimes. The lack of interesting characters was apparent also, since there is no longer Jacob Snell, Cade Langmore, Agent Petty, Mason and Rachel, there were spots to fill that weren't filled. Agent Evans makes a few appearances, Agent Miller is about as interesting as dry wall, so the only good addition was Ben. Helen got a lot more screentime.... And the finale was lackluster, with the payoff being a under acheivment. Also Wyatt and Darlene as a couple is strange, but could work in the story However, that relationship is shown much at all, except for a handful scenes and a disgusting sex scene between a 18-19 year old and a grandma age woman that I never want to see again. Overall, Season 3 was lackluster, uneventful, dull, and a disappointment. The characters and relationships are almost all extremely underdeveloped and lacking depth, except for a few. And Wendy taking the spotlight, puts the main character in the background, and annoys the viewer in its redundancy.
Season 3: 5/10
Maybe Season 4 can do better.
Overall Series: 6/10 While the first season is quite ok, it is all going down in S2 and I stoooed watching with the end of that season. the story becomes more and more absurd and no later than when Buddy finally dies, there seems to be no character with a normal functioning brain left. it is sad, because the concept had more potential and most of the actors are doing a good job. One of the best series I have ever seen. Top performances, suspense, drama in perfect balance. I am sure the next season will be equally excellent. If you're into dysfunctional families, boy, will this series appeal to you. Not only that, but it's got money laundering, Mexican drug cartels, bribery, extortion and the occasional murder to keep things interesting. There are only two name actors here, as Jason Bateman and Laura Linney portray the married couple Marty and Wendy Byrde, relocating from Chicago to the Missouri Ozarks to escape an untenable situation back home. The only thing is, with each passing episode, their situation becomes even more untenable. I'm a little late coming to the series, and more or less binge watched the entire three available seasons on Netflix over the past couple of weeks. Bateman and Linney head an exceptional cast, and you'll gaze in awe as the various characters go through their paces in an often deadly dance to stay a step ahead of local authorities and the FBI. Friends who have introduced me to the show seem to key in on Ruth Langmore (Julia Garner) as a favorite character, though she's a bit too extreme for my tastes, always scowling and throwing the 'f' word around in virtually every sentence. Personally, I can't really point to a favorite, although Buddy Dieker (Harris Yulin) appealed to me as a down home old codger with a world of wisdom to offer. There were skeletons in his closet as well, but the show didn't focus much on his background other than a few significant hints regarding his association with the Kansas City mob. There are a handful of contenders for the most vicious character, and Darlene Snell (Lisa Emery) could possibly top that list. To be sure, there are no angels here, as even the Byrde teenagers, Charlotte (Sofia Hublitz) and Jonah (Skylar Gaertner) become enmeshed in the family machinations. With Season #4 not available till 2021, it'll prove tough to be patient to see what comes next, but if I know this series, it won't leave it's fans disappointed. Great writing- Great directing and acting! Intricate storyline that is clearly planned in advance from Season One! Laura Linney pens this role! Incredible actors!! A story beautifully written and what an end! The last episode felt like the time stopped! This show is SOOO well written and acted. Some of the best writing in the last decade! I am giving it 9 because of 1st season is quite boring but 2,3 seasons are great must watch A very intense story. Makes me glad I don't have anything to do with Mexican drug cartels!! I'm no prude, but all of the F-bombs get old after a while. They should be used to sprinkle seasoning on it, not be a main course. I personally think that the show is very interesting and addictive. The 3rd season is very intence but i do have to say i think the show is slow. But i beleve that the show is very realistic. There are not that many shows ir movies that are realistic. But i do have to say to be prepared to enjoy yourself some times and just wish that it was over other times. A thrilling and suspenseful series with an excellent cast. I thoroughly enjoyed Seasons 1 to 3, can't wait for Season 4 to be released! Well done Netflix! This is the best series happening right now. It has it's own thrill, suspense and multiple twist throughout the whole three seasons. If you are looking for something different and something more thrilling, this series will be your right choice.<br/><br/>Enjoy! Fant√É¬°stico thriller donde Jason Bateman est√É¬° genial I enjoyed the show very much also have twist in show make show great <ul><li>having just completed watching season 3, this show has most definitely grown on me, to a degree where it has become binge watching worthy.</li></ul><br/><br/>I don't want to give any spoilers away, but let me just tell you, by the end of season 3, this has become a modern day drama of Shakespearian proportions.<br/><br/>In the initial concept for the show, it is similar to Braking Bad in many respects, but I think this show is better.<br/><br/>Jason Bateman (who also directs the show occasionally) is simply fantastic, as the emotionally stunted "ordinary" man, who slowly progress into becoming a criminal mastermind.<br/><br/>Laura Linney is giving the performance of her career, as the frustrated, slightly neurotic, but yet completely controlled former professional woman turned housewife turned criminal, who is in a constant struggle between her conscience, her need for security, and her ambition.<br/><br/>The kids of the family, who are usually an afterthought in many shows, are both magnificently portrayed by up and coming stars Sofia Hublitz and Skylar Gaertner, who both lend debth to their characters.... and this is coming from someone, who usually find kids actors distracting and irrelevant in most dramas.<br/><br/>And finally Julia Garner is giving an Emmy-worthy performance as the hillbilly, trash talking, wise ass local, who is constantly the catalyst for story development.<br/><br/>I highly recommend the show, even if the first season can seem kind of boring to some, it all makes sense later on, in a show that was clearly planned for a multi-season run from the outset, and the story is thus allowed to develop and build slowly. It may sometimes looks like an exciting trip beyond pure violence, in the dark world of the cartels, but at the end, it's nothing but a predictible little tour in a pathetic ghost train where everything is fake, predictible and harmless... I can't understand how it could be compared in any way with the amazing Breaking Bad! They sure like making the Cartel look stupid. I don't agree with the things they do but stupid is far from a word I would use. Netflix's Ozark's premise is as simple as its theme - crime pays until it doesn't.<br/><br/>Financial adviser Marty Byrde and his partner have a nice little second income - laundering money for a drug cartel. His partner gets crazy handling all this money and decides the cartel won't miss a few million - it's the kind of idea that leads to the cemetery. Meanwhile, his wife is about to leave him for greener pastures but her lover gets dead. The cartel is about to kill everybody when Marty talks them into letting them live to launder another 5 million. For reasons you won't remember, the financial advisor has to take his family to the Ozarks to make this happen.<br/><br/>I was never a Jason Bateman fan - he has over 90 acting credits on IMDB and only Arrested Development stands out. I have changed my opinion. Bateman is excellent as said financial advisor, Marty Byrde. Now, he has a lot of good company, namely his wife, Wendy, played by the amazing Laura Linney, his daughter played by exotic-looking newcomer Sofia Hublitz, his employee, Ruth, by the explosive Julia Garner and his boss' boots-on-the-ground representative, Helen, by the ever-threatening Janet McTeer.<br/><br/>The first two seasons have the usual mix of very good plot lines, stories and episodes, but nothing that is out of the ordinary in this new Golden Age of TV. Then, this week, season three was released on Netflix and bam! Ozark has set itself apart with excellent writing.<br/><br/>Mr. and Mrs. Byrde have strongly opposed ideas on the best way to extricate themselves and family from the clutches of a homicidal, maniacal Mexican drug lord - is there any other type?<br/><br/>They bought a casino since casino ownership is Money Laundering 101. Mr. Byrde wants to sit tight, do the laundering and hope somehow they get an opportunity to fly - yeah like a bird. Mrs. Byrde, on the other hand, wants to expand and buy more casinos and in the words of Michael Corleone, go legitimate in the next few years. She reasons that casinos make tons of money (unless your name is Donald Trump) legitimately so eventually they can be 'safe.'<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Wendy's long lost brother, Ben ( Tom Pelphrey) shows up. He's wanted in another state and is somewhat annoying as he goes through various convulsions when he discovers what his sister and her husband are up to. But he is a little crazy - I mean certified - so he falls for Ruth and starts creating havoc wherever he goes. Ben is bi-polar and Ozark is excellent at portraying the problems of dealing with a person you love who is mentally ill. The main problem and what makes mental illness a most insidious disease is that the person who has it denies having it and often refuses all help or treatment.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Helen is involved in a custody battle with her ex over their only child, Erin (Madison Thompson). There's a baby who is being cared for by the poster mother of deranged moms played perfectly by Lisa Emery. Wendy wants custody of that child - it's a long story - and what Wendy wants, she usually gets.<br/><br/>The theme of the season is summed up by the drug lord. He gets enthusiastic about the idea of making money at a second casino and gives Wendy the OK to buy it. When the owners refuse to accept her very generous offer, she explains to Mister Drug Lord that they are acting unreasonably and he offers this piece of advice - if reason doesn't work, try force.<br/><br/>Season 3 of Ozark pits the Byrdes against each other as each of them makes a bid to control their lives. They have to make very difficult choices and the complications of their lives comes close to mirroring the problems of life itself. And isn't that the hope of all dramatists - to write to a story that has some of the complications that real life has? Ozark does that - and it's not pretty, but very, very real. Season 3 starts out great and is just as spectacular as the other two, but then they had to bring Wendy's brother into the picture. I am not exactly sure why bc personally he was horrible for this show and put season 3 in the wrong direction. I have never written a review but hate the direction Wendy's brother brought the show. Season 3 is ok but not as good as the other two. I hope and if here is a season 4 I hope they go back with the direction season 1 and 2. But also have to add Wendy becomes a bad and  fond of her character transformation. The characters are very well scripted. The story has some good twists with a few unexpected violent shocks. Some of the characters are just not nice to say the least, but are needed as they all bring something to the show. It's a great watch and when it gets into full swing you just can't stop. Looking forward to series 3 Believe me this story will get to you once you get the hang of it.
Multiple character's storyline running with so much in common and connection.
At last, I would say it is worth binge watching. The second season of Ozark starts out strong. It continues on with the intriguing storylines it set up last season for the first six episodes, but as the show chugs along into the second half of the season it becomes clear that the writers weren't exactly sure how to drag this season's storylines out to 10 episodes, and the pacing and entertainment level of the show suffer as a result. The second season didn't jump shark that much, but there was a moment that frustrated me more because it was so idiotic.
The show is okay... I just feel like I've seen it a bunch of times before. I'd rather watch it without the cartel and the FBI. I'm tired of people writing sincere stories about stuff they've never experienced, without bothering to do any actual research. I had some doubts about Ozark prior to release for various reasons, but I was wrong. I have to give Jason Bateman credit, I never knew he had it in him. The show is very well cast, acted, written, and directed. Out of the gate in the first episode you are hit with an intensity to the situation that few shows ever produce, much less begin with. The underlying threat sets Marty Byrde and family in ongoing danger that the show does an excellent job building on each episode with situations that seem to have no resolution. Each resolution has consequences however, building to a finale that while somewhat satisfying, definitely leaves you hungry for the next season by creating the mother of difficult circumstances. Few shows leave me saying WOW, especially after the first season, this one did. Netflix has done a good job on several shows, they just moved the bar higher. Not something for kids. The only thing that kept me binging the whole season last night was a bike ride I had planned this morning. Three episodes in and I can't get it fast enough. No, it's not Breaking Bad and it's not trying to be. It seems that the people making this comparison are a lot worse at writing reviews than the creators of Ozark are at writing for TV.<br/><br/>I've never really felt one way or another about Jason Bateman but in this series he has definitely found a role that he can really sink his teeth into, and deep.<br/><br/>Now let's just hope that it can keep up this pace and they don't forget about telling a story and just try to lure viewers into the next season. I think this story could be told most effectively in only one season. I wish TV would do more shows with a limited number of episodes. How anyone can continue watching Game of Thrones after 7 seasons is beyond my understanding.<br/><br/>√Ç¬°√Ç¬°Spoilers Ahead!!<br/><br/>Episode 4<br/><br/>And then it starts to go off the rails, at least a little bit although the episode was entertaining. The question is, if he wants a strip club why doesn't he just build his own? If he knows the guy is laundering money wouldn't he want to back off?<br/><br/>And please, please don't waste a bunch of air time on the kids in what I call the Meadow Soprano Syndrome. It's boring and doesn't advance the story.<br/><br/>Episode 5<br/><br/>Why wouldn't the kid tell his dad that there was someone in the house? That made zero sense. And he lets the hick chick follow him to where he stashes the $8 mil?<br/><br/>Distributing the heroin in bibles? Dumb. Why can't the police touch them on the water? Huh? Like it's out of their jurisdiction? Stupid, and of course this is in direct conflict with him wanting to build a church. What an absolute let down. I question what all these people are carrying on about the brother and his fantastic acting skills. Being brought to tears. Good grief. How about the complete disruption of the storyline due to this irritating hopeless brother. An entire painful hour of him mucking up and being forgiven. Each episode had me hanging for the next. This episode had me wishing for it to end. What were the writers thinking!? This show is terrible, in so many different ways. And just with that on sentence I already have better rating than the show. In case you were wondering, this series is as good as Breaking Bad. That's not to say it's a copy. There are some similarities but it's not deja vu. It's similar in that it's as well written - everything that is shown matters, the characters both the good and bad are interesting and there is a real involvement in the story which is unpredictable and captivating. It's different enough - it's money laundering not meth making. And the location is a lakeside community in the Ozarks. And the whole family finds out pretty soon. From Episode 1 the viewer gets drawn in. In fact it's so good that the last episode of Season 1 is as emotionally draining and scary and exciting as anything in the later seasons of Breaking Bad. A true successor to Breaking Bad in quality.<br/><br/>The acting is just right - never over shadowing the story so it's that much more effective. As Marty Byrde Jason Bateman an actor often thought of as comedian and his not overly serious face helps keep the drama from being unpleasant to watch when it gets intense. He is a sympathetic and believable central character. Laura Linney is one great actress and it's so great she gets a good TV series so more people can see how good she is, beyond the movies she has done. You watch every scene she is in - more endearing than Skylar. The son is quite good. The daughter is a strange choice. She looks more like one of the Ozark natives than a city girl. The Ozark redneck/white trash are an interesting non one dimensional bunch. From the talented Julia Garner as Ruth Langmore. Her kinfolk include a rather amusing queer redneck who becomes involved with a queer FBI agent after the Byrdes. The dangerous ones are the Snells a nasty poppy grower with an even nastier wife. They are the Salamancas of the Ozarks.<br/><br/>I can't wait for Season 2. Wow what's everybody raving about. It's only another series reflecting how Americas moral standards are going down the drain. The series doesn't appeal to my mind and disgust me. I liked the first two season but the thrid one is as said a masterpiece. The cast for Ruth and Wendy is showing even more what they are capable of.
Cant wait for season 4. The show is beyond cliche. It's over-written and over-acted. Wendy is annoying beyond belief and the kids aren't much better. Bateman is the only redeeming aspect of the show.<br/><br/>Watch it knowing you will find yourself fast-forwarding a lot. I normally run a mile from any show that's to do with drugs/guns/mobs/cartels/money laundering etc. They just don't do a thing for me. But...I love Jason Bateman's work so much I thought I'd give this a go way back when season 1 just came out, fully expecting to hate it/be so confused it just wouldn't be worth it for me. How completely wrong I was. Ozark is simply incredible. It is beyond compare. I have struggled long and hard to find fault, but I am completely unable. If I could give it 11/10 I would do so. The characters are so beautifully drawn, the script is tight and fast, the story arcs breathtaking. Every single person involved in this show should be so, so proud. I finished season 3 this morning and am still reeling...I cannot wait for season 4. SE3 Epi 3: Stressed me out.
Wendy is more hateful as the series airs. Kudos.
Brother Ben: delightfully unhinged. Likable!
Helen should have horns. Bravo.
Ruth needs a swear jar. Someone hug that feral cat.
Poor Darlene. I almost feel bad for her. Almost.
No! Not Marty! No! Hugging my chihuahua for comfort.<br/><br/>Normally a third season isn't as strong as the first but this...! So, so good. This show is off the chain...! Season 3, every episode was excellent and left you wanting more. The last episode was INSANE! Where is season FOUR... CANNOT WAIT! Season 3 going as strong as the first two seasons. In a way it's like a mini breaking bad without the drugs. You have death and violence and twists around every corner. Sold series glad season 3 cam out the other day because I've been struggling to watch thing and watching all this within a day really . This is one of the very best shows out there. Casting is superb. I am always looking forward to watching more. Jason has perfected his acting and project choices. Have always been a fan of his and his lovely sister. And then there is the incredible Laura Linney. Enjoy. Drug cartel shows have gained steady popularity resently and I was pretty sceptic about Ozark, thinking that it has been created to ride on the popularity of Narcos etc. I was hook, line and sinker impressed by the season 1 of Ozark, possibly because the expectations were not that high in the beginning. Season 1 rated 8.<br/><br/>I'm now half way through season 2 and my disappointment is growing by episode. Script has gone beyond belief and most of the main characters have developed in to less plausible direction. Season 2, weak 5 This TV Show is one the best I watched for a long time. In my mind, season 2 is better than season 1. However, both are a TV masterpieces.
The story is great, the acting is superb, and it show what happened right in our backyard in America: Politics, Money, and Power.
Take the time to watch it. You will not be disappointed. Although the main idea is almost the same with Breaking Bad, yet I love it. After watching the first episode of Ozark I wasn't that excited about watching a second. I only did so because my girlfriend wanted to. But that next episode was much better, and I had a lot of hope for the series.<br/><br/>But at the end of season 1 I'm still a little lukewarm to it all.<br/><br/>The good is very good. Marty Byrde is a fascinating character, and I love those moments where he talks himself out of an impossible situation; it's interesting to see a crime show where the protagonist never results to violence. Ruth is a terrific character as well. The plotting is elaborate and fairly convincing.<br/><br/>But I find my interesting waxing and waning throughout each episode. And in general I'm not big on shows where characters hop from one disaster to the next; it's exhausting. I watched grudgingly three episodes of this series in the hopes that it would turn around. The concept of the story, I thought, was intriguing. The execution and the acting fell apart quickly. The twists and turns that the series produced fell flat. I was left with disappointment. I certainly think this series had someplace it could go. I am going to conclude that this is not worth watching a single episode; please do not waste your time on this show. A very fine balance is required when you tell a story that has so many character and story twists and turns. It needs to be smart and it needs, no matter the plot contrivance, to convince.
OZARKS struggles to be either smart or convincing. 
It tries, it really does, but it's struggle is all to apparent. 
Some sharper writing may right the ship but I feel the damage may be done. The characters are not likable in Ozark. The story line and plot are worthy of attention, but for whatever reason, whether it's the overall decision of the director and/or producers, or the writing doesn't allow for it, but I find myself laughing at the scenes where they expect the audience to capture some sort of monumental emotional connection with the characters' dilemmas ... and I don't have any. It's definitely not a home run, more like a triple, and caught in a rundown.to home. <br/><br/>There's nothing else to say here; the quality of cinema is all about having likable characters, even if there are hideously or horribly detestable (Joker in The Dark Knight, Fring in Breaking Bad). You want to, you turn on the next episode to take the incredible ride in their shoes, but I want no part of their shoes, so I am left to watch from a distance, and bear none of the substantial emotional roller coaster that there should be. I'll watch episodes of "The Killing" or "Big Little Lies" in a heartbeat, and give those shows credit for achieving success. This? Meh.. <br/><br/>It's actually more disappointing to watch a series that had the potential for being a masterpiece but fails at a certain, rather important level, than to watch something that doesn't try to do anything more than entertain. I didn't think i would watch the 2nd season in just 2 days...well that explains it all.. I don't mind cussing in shows - but just cause you can shouldn't mean it'll be every other word. Another show I recently watched was same issue - so I wonder if the characters add this or it's in the script but it gets rediculous - overall the show is ok. Plot has loop holes , Not funny no action complete waste of time There were so many implausible situations and actions in the first episode, I had to cover my eyes -- not because of the violence, but rather out of embarrassment . Without giving away specific moments in the first episode, consider this: Mexican nationals and all Latin American nationals that are in the drug trade do not commit narco traffic crimes in the U.S. because the U.S. has a death penalty law for narco traffickers; Latin America does not. That's why Escobar, as part of an agreement to surrender to Colombian authorities, had to be guaranteed he would not be extradicted to the U.S. Second, if you're a ruthless murderer and experienced drug trafficker, would you believe one individual could earn you $500,000,000 a year in laundered money at the risk of being turned in as a narco trafficker to face the death penalty? I don't think so. Would you commit capital crimes in broad daylight in a large U.S. city? I don't think so. If you worked with a murderous drug dealer, would you try to skim money from his operation if you're already earning enough? I don't think so. Is the set up for this TV series plausible? I don't think so. 03/10/2020 I am so looking forward to March 27, 2020 when season 3 gets started. Not only is it a wonderfully written, thoroughly engrossing storyline but the actors/actresses choses are just perfect for their parts. The big three are Julia Garner/Ruth Laura Linney/Wendy and Jason BatemanMarty. Supberb says it best. Hope it continues for many more seasons. Bon Appetit' Jason Bateman and crew hit a grand slam for the game winner with this series! The script is intriguing, the cast delivers a 5-star performance, and the premise of this series keeps the fan base wanting more and more with the suspenseful relevancy of every episode. Well Done!!!!!
Is it March 27th yet?? Jason Bateman and Laura Linney are absolutely flawless in their performances, and the supporting cast is just as good. The storyline is completely believable and the writers/directors never "take their foot off the gas." Both seasons are of equally high quality. If that weren't enough, Julia Garner will steal your heart! I was rated the first season as 6 stars , but season 2 i will be generous if i rate it more than 3 stars! bad writing , annoying actor , there in no really story , im surprise that some people compare it with Breaking Bad!<br/><br/>also surprise the season nominated for some emmy award The show has some real potential but there are too many moments where you feel like they intentionally make batemans character way too impossible to believe.Breaking bad had a much harder edge in its leads character and was more believable. I cant decide if its the writing or bateman but his lead trying to pull off the family man vibe just doesn't quite fit.<br/><br/>And there are some timeline issues in one episode with characters ages that really left me asking who would allow such a mess through production.<br/><br/>Still think it has enough shock value to run awhile if they lay off the everyone is clueless style they are using at the moment A really terrific series, with excellent characters and an incredibly tense storyline. It's only let down by the Deliverance-esque hillbillies. Surely the writers could have developed more interesting villains besides what are portrayed, rather patronisingly, as stupid white trash. I hope these characters are dropped - apart from the young woman, who is sharp as a tack, and potentially interesting. I am totally sucked in by this story! Jason Bateman plays his character excellently. Just coming to the end of season one & I can't wait to watch the rest, no negative comments towards this series from me it's a must watch üëç Took a while to get going mainly character building for the first season and a half but stick with it and you'll see one of the very best shows in years, Bateman is outstanding acting wise and directing wise it's well put together and extremely clever really hope there's a 4th season Without a doubt, Ozark improves every season. With more emphasis on Laura Linney's impeccable performance, Ozark overcomes all barriers and reaches his extreme in an incredible 3 season, surpassing expectations and showing off as a strong candidate for Emmys 2020 alongside The Crown and Succession. Season 1 of Ozark is a masterpiece to watch and Jason Bateman did an amazing job creating it and acting in it. The conflicts created in this story are interesting and the crimes is wild. It is something everyone needs to give a chance. I think it's the best show at the moment. It has everything : solid storyline, high-quality acting, the scenes are captured pretty good with the colors , the music, etc. Simply I love it. I love d breaking bad too but they are totally different. It has his own magic ! As I watched the third series of Ozark, and digested the final seconds of the last episode, I thought again as I have so many times over this series... " wow, this has gotten really dark". The hole which the family finds itself in continu√©s to become deeper and more complicated as they struggle to survive in an ever complicated situation. I also thought this series was the strongest yet for the women characters..... they are definitely one group of dark, cold b......s! This is not a series for someone looking for that happy ending, or everything will be okay Optimism. But, if your interested in seeing the darker side of our psyche and existence, check it out. Looking forward to see where the fourth series takes the story. This show is great not gonna lie!!!<br/><br/>Minor Spoilers Below<br/><br/>I only have a few little/minor critiques:<br/><br/>-Episodes are two long. 40 minutes would probarly been more ideal, and the episode count be expanded to maybe 15 or something.
-Episodes are good, but very very slow.
-Characters are sometimes introduced and they are suddenly talking to another character, they just met as if they go for coffee twice a week. Eg Ruth and Wendy, Ruth and Charlotte (didnt think they knew each other but they did) Wendy and Helen. ect...
-Some episodes with not enough Marty and Ruth
-A little too many characters.
-Buddy should have died in the last episode, not 206.<br/><br/>S1: 8.5 out of 10 enjoyed the majority
S2: 8 out of 10 still very good, a bit too many characters, at times I got confused, furtherly the casino deal went on for like 10 episodes
S3: 9.5/10 AMAZING<br/><br/>Overall great acting, great mystery, great writing and roasts (Ruth), great negotiating skills (Marty and Wendy), even great fight scenes too :) worth the watch. New season 3 : It takes an episode or two before it grasps you back into the story line that has been tickling you all along about how the characters (all well played) will cope with the unreal mess they've been drawn into. Plot is weaved at a pace where you can't notice or bother to question any inconsistency which - if there at all - is well eliminated by a bunch of fine actors (and actresses). Great production. For people who likes to think while watching and the value of family, roles of parents and kids
parenting style Every season has been great!!! I've thoroughly enjoyed this series! Thank you! A well made, brilliantly acted show - but honestly, I don't get this fascination with violence that seems to permeate so much of current tv/ streaming productions. After a few episodes, not only did I find myself bored and somewhat gobsmacked by the illogical and highly improbable moments (the various murders that seem to disappear with ease, not to mention the ridiculous money laundering methods...), but repulsed by the continual flow of blood that seems to fill so much of the show's bleak storyline. Yes, it tries to deal with the psychological repercussions of these violent moments on the main characters - but only to a point, and to be honest it doesn't really feel like anything new (name any of the numerous violence packed shows of the past decade or so). After finishing season 2, I'm merely left bored and questioning the need to continually show so much suffering on mainstream television, for isn't there enough of it out there in the real world? Enduring yet more of it via my computer screen seems not only unnecessary, but cruel to those who face real violence (akin to that often portrayed) on a daily basis. This is wholly my opinion. I just want to put that out there first. I really like this show but, the actors who were cast to play agent Petty and Cade are this close to making me stop watching. Completely unconvincing andCade is so bad I find myself mocking his horribly fake accent every time he speaks. I can only hope they are bumped off soon. For all 3 seasons, each year the whole season has been binge watched to a high degree. A true "just another one". Laura Linney's character progression is possibly the most admiring from the outset - a great actress. This dramedy brings you on a fun journey with emotions changing very swiftly. Hope to see at least 2 more seasons as it just keeps getting better! The dialogue is excellent and some of the best there is today, there's nothing that's too terribly unbelievable in the show (with a couple minor excuses), and the amount of times a simple conversation in an office or such can be Crafted so deeply suspenseful is flooring. Well done to everyone involved. Here's to 3 more season at least! Loved S1, thought S2 was a little slow but boy did it get going in the most resent season. Class show, great cast. One of the best programs on Netflix. If u have not watched this then get watching Julian Garner is Amazing as Ruth!
So are Laura Linney and Jason Bateman. Hoping for a Season 4 and that Larua wins an Emmy, well deserved! This show is never boring. It develops the characters and storyline at a pace that is realistic and keeps you engaged. The acting is off the charts - wouldn't expect anything less from these actors. Quality wise, this is right up there with Breaking Bad. So far, all 3 seasons are an awesome ride! Excellent series...another version of breaking bad thriller...can not wait 4 season 4...highly recommended. Absolutely top stuff here, stories, characters, acting. Brilliant! The absolute best acting of any thing I've ever watched You can see the similarity's right ?
Both very enjoyable just think Ozark story and pacing is much better, I also think the Characters are much more developed you can really get behind them and root for them as the seasons go on.
The Series never feels unrealistic or unnaturally... it all just works together.<br/><br/>Acting on all parts I would say is A class and Ozark is defiantly worth a watch by all accounts. It's like Breaking Bad which I love and adore, I call it the Breaking Bad of this time, nice story telling and timeline which you will never be bored, maybe it's little boring in the first episodes, but this is acceptable as it is just the beginning and it puts everything in it's position and every character to it's place and ofc the actors are brilliant with Jason in leading role!. Every season is way more better than the past one!!. I recommend this TV Show very much if you one of the people that love drama!. And if you loved BB then this show is the best option to see rn!. Waiting for next season so much!. And I hope it is so good as the last seasons actually!. Very hyped!. First up this show is entertaining and will keep you watching. However here and there you'll find some flaws and inconsistencies that might be destroying the dense atmosphere you're enjoying.
As a guy, who is really into movies involving the Mexican drug cartel and everything around it, I was disturbed the most by how naive and just little ruthless the cartel was acting. E.g. in season 2 Episode 5 they spend so much effort and time into waterboarding and interrogating this hillbilly and minor girl named Ruth, to make sure she didn't know too much instead of simply killing her. Additionally Marty is causing so much obvious trouble all the time, leading to deaths of important people and the FBI chasing him. He even monitored the call of the cartel boss and the cartel itself responds by kidnapping him and trying to figure out what's going inside his family. To this point Marty didn't even really prove how much of an accountant-mastermind he really his. From season to season he saves his and his family's life by making new pompous promises after having right beforehand. The viewer is under the impression that the protagonist of the show is under some kind of magic protective shield.
The atmosphere, character development, and dynamics between the characters however are well designed and make the show worth watching. I loved this show as soon as the season 01 was released, even though there were plot holes, it was was quite different than the rest. I personally love the direction though-out the series, hence giving it 2 stars.<br/><br/>Season 02 and 03 are just God awful. The dialogue is Okay but the writing is atrocious and full of cliches. For instance, couple of story-lines felt out of order and just plain stupid, when suddenly Charlotte decided to emancipate and now Jonah, who despite threatening Helen at gunpoint seems to get away with it.<br/><br/>There is less emphasis on character development and more on introducing to self-destructive characters who are a clear danger to our protagonists. What? Why? The Cartel aren't antagonistic enough so we keep seeing Marty and Wendy stupidly fight over and over and over. Darlene, Ruth's Dad and Uncles, Ben (Which to me ruined season 03).<br/><br/>Ben's and Ruth's Dad plot was down right stupid. Here, Marty and Wendy jeopardize the future of the family and keep ignoring it. It doesn't make sense. The story suffered because of Wendy's shenanigans! She had way more screen time than was necessary. Marty knows Ruth is crazy and could break any moment. He still somehow grows conscience and decide to not do anything or have a back-up plan in case things go South. It's crazy to even to even think about it. All I can say is, they act smart at one point and completely abandon the natural instincts and logical reasoning in the next scene. Why the hell would Ruth help out his father during the heists? Why does Ruth love Ben and trusts him more than the Byrdes? The list goes on and on and on.<br/><br/>We had to so many scenes of Ben, when the option viable option was to kill him eventually, and then Wendy mourning over his death. What a waste of time! Also. there is no way Navarro will kill Helen, who he's known for quite some time and is a lawyer, even if you wager there is no way Marty and Wendy are more important than Helen. Most of the season, characters will just keep repeating their mistakes, ever 3,4 episodes, Ruth will loose it, Darlene will cause trouble, if that does not work then we always have the Civil War amongst the Byrdes. It predictable and boring as hell.<br/><br/>It is so frustrating to to watch it as a viewer. I can say I've been through Hell during this series and I won't be returning! This series is really good surprise. I just checked IMDb most popular series, I found this mysterious one "Ozark" with good notations.<br/><br/>I didn't hear about it, so I didn't know what to expect. I binge-watched it, I couldn't stop so it was good.. This remind me somehow of Breaking Bad, the atmosphere, the scenario and the main character.<br/><br/>10/10. Great series :)<br/><br/>P.S. Sorry, I wanted to explain better my thoughts, but I'm still learning English, I don't want to write sentences where I'm too unclear because of my bad vocabulary/syntax/whatever.<br/><br/>If you want to know if this is a series worth watching, it definitely is, and you should really give it a chance ;) Season is sooo bad and cringeworthy. Everyone talks like they are right when every single one is a criminal. Kids are still obnoxious. Women are so much of themselves. It's like a propaganda pulled down our throats. Please forgive me because I did not get too far; I only did the first episode. I got up to the part where they introduce the Hispanic drug lord and it was soooooooo pretentious and they tried too hard to make him the ultimate "bad guy". It was pretentious from the start but I gave it a try until the scene with the drug lord. It's basically a bootleg breaking bad. People say it reminds them of BB but it's actually a copy in the beginning at least. No creativity at all. <br/><br/>All I do is watch movies and tv shows and critique them in my head because I love the film industry and would like to make a movie one day. I tend to watch things that are inspiring make me fall in love with film. This show is such a drag. Good idea but fell flat, such a shame. Brutal 3rd season, almost as if no script and was made up on the fly...wow. S1 and S2 is good. S3 is full of C and S.
I can't believe it. Totally waste of time and your money What happened to this show? One of my favorites just took a huge turn. The show is now about keeping everyone quiet,but telling everyone. How many episodes were spent on the brother? They no longer show the violence The kids hold all cards and everyone just has know everything. It's not the same show. The story is frustrating to watch. The season finale was good , yet half of the season was irritating to watch. I hope they wake up and bring back what made this show so damn good. This is the best show I've watched in a very long time and the best show Ive watched on Netflix. The writing is absolutely incredible; crisp, sharp, intentional. The writers know this story inside out and it makes for really high quality believable tv. Amazing casting of all the characters. Really natural character archs, ridiculously tense twists in plot and superb cinematography make this movie-quality show too binge-worthy! This show is phenomenal! Wearing multiple hats the always entertaining Jason Bateman takes his career to the next level and should be recognized accordingly. The casting for Ozark is as perfect as it could be. The young actors hold their own among the strong veteran cast. I think the potential of Julia Garner is unlimited, a superstar in the making! Does Esai Morales ever have a bad performance? The answer is no, why isn't this guy at the next level of stardom? Show keeps you on the edge and should quickly become a Netflix favorite. This series MUST continue and hopefully stay as strong. I don't like the subject, I know is fiction but appears to be so real. I have little to no understanding for drug dealings and money laundering . Brings only pain and death but this series is insanely outstanding, a very well made and acted drama. Great performance from all actors, such a great setting, real and sad, tough to watch. I started watching for Jason Bateman and Laura Linney and I ended liking very much Julia Gardner, Charlie Tahan, Harris Yulin and so many others, The entire cast is a delight to watch acting, If you expect a Hollywood type of movie with happy ending and some lessons learned, where they hug and ask for forgiveness, is not for you. This is not a romantic comedy. It's a great drama that stays with you some time after you STOP the last scene. I have no doubt is happening in many places in real America, a forgotten place where people see no hope to get out unless.... and they fall. This is wonderfully well written with well rounded characters and strong ensemble acting. It's too soon to say whether it's another Breaking Bad but so far so very very good. I love the on screen interactions of the two lead characters and it's marvellous to find so many well rounded and fully written female roles. Well done to everyone involved. Oh and it's enlivened with a good dollop of humour. No plot spoilers here. The plot is engaging and well thought out. Enough said. Now that I've watched all the episodes available currently on Netflix I have a challenge for Jason Bateman et al - do not make season 2. As it is, in its season one incarnation, it seems a pretty satisfying whole. All the plot lines are resolved and I don't need to know more. So, let it go Jason, let it go. There's a challenge for you. Another series killed. Seasons 1 and 2 were great...Season 3 is ridiculously stupid. In seasons 1 and 2 the characters were well done. The family is caught in impossible situations and they find clever ways of dealing with it. Overall, the plot followed an interesting line. In season 3 all the women are strong and intelligent (but devious), all the men are complete idiots or psychopaths. Nothing in season 3 made any sense...it's like the writers didn't even see the series and just wanted to follow a Hollywood PC "only women are strong and intelligent" storyline. "If" there is a season 4 I won't be watching it. Would it be asking too much to have more lighting in the series.
Can barely see what's going on Super story and it just keeps on getting better as the seasons go on ... I never write reviews but I had to after season 3 .. brilliant ! So glad it got a 3rd season. Bateman is a great director and it shows with Ozark. I can't find any faults in the show other than a few illogical scenerios, but I understand why they presented it like they did, and it doesn't take away from the impact that the show will have on viewers. Can't wait for season 4!√∞≈∏Àú≈† The show is entertaining, dark and gritty. Lots of half nude girls because of the strip club scenes. What I'm not understanding is what the point is with the gay FBI character. It really has nothing to do with the show that I've seen so far and it seems to be written just to be edgy. I'm not really into watching two guys get it on so after just watching a second encounter, I'm done with the show. This is a very good sitcom with the drug and the guns but their is a but coming. It's not a realistic sitcom. You don't launder money with amping the expenditures. I was in money laundering before I knew it was called money laundering so I know what I'm taking about. If you want to know money laundering then learn from the best in the business: Walter and Skyler White. Cartels don't send lawyers, if one of them gets capped then family or henchmen comes looking for you. I guess this is what divides the sheep from the wolves. Season 4 pleaseeeeee!!!!! But like a 20 episode a season I'm watching episode 6 of season 1 now and I have to say it's to slow for me. To much talking, not enough happens. I mean: what did happen in six episodes, would fit in two episodes. Then it would be less boring! Also the characters, they are still strangers to me, while it is important that you sympathize. That does not happen. I will watch until episode 10, if the series does not get less boring, I will stop watching. I don't understand the high rating if this series! Are they all paid by Netflix, or what?! Acting /Directing/cinematography are ALL on a top tier,I'm not Gonna spoil any plot line for you, but what i will say is, if and it's a BIG IF!, season 4 is just as Good, then it's a SERIOUS Breaking Bad rivel........NOW GO AND WATCH 'DARK' as that's simply just as Good!!!.. All Women characters act like low class tradh males. And all the males love getting cucked.<br/><br/>Every character sucks, Jason should stick to acting and not directing such trash, dialogue is like a 5 year old wrote it.<br/><br/>Watch this show if you want to hate every single characters guts. Started watching and was quickly hooked! I'm a huge fan of both Bateman and Linney. By the time season 3 was over , Ozark is now in my top 3 of all-time with GOT and The Wire!!! I've just gotta say. This Series is one of the best series made ever. Just take the depth of the characters for instance, with the like of Ruth, who is a character that you just don't get to see in other series.. she's so real and so complex, even without using words, she transmits so much emotion to the viewers. All the actors, play so well in this series, it makes it all seem so real. Then there is the way the story unfolds, from how it's all so well intertwined, with trivial things connecting to the whole plot, and the past affecting the future choices of characters. The attention to detail of this whole show is amazing. The way the characters feel so familiar in such a setting is spectacular. Definitely something to watch. Enjoyable humor and entertaining story. Would recommend! This show is a homerun. I've watched both seasons several times and can't wait for more! Every bit as good as Breaking Bad. I thought Breaking Bad was intense- and it was- but it has nothing on this show. Every episode leaves you exhausted and yet wanting more. Kudos to the writers, cast, and crew for a superb piece of entertainment. And thank you Netflix for green lighting this. Can't wait until next season and the new characters- after all so many of the existing characters were killed! Ozark is a bit like Breaking Bad, a guy wanting to save his family by doing dodgy deals. In Breaking Bad it was just one man producing drugs, competing with the Mexican cartel, and becoming his own Mafia at one point. In Ozark it's not the same as it's a whole family working for the Mexican cartel by laundering money and doing other illegal activities. It's about the same but Breaking Bad was just more intenser and suspenseful. But Ozark is certainly worth watching. It's better than much of other good series. The acting is good, the plot is interesting with new twists every episodes. Not a series you get bored after awhile. I saw the first two seasons and it looked like it could go on and secretly I hope it will. Poorly written. Bad over the top characters with personality disorders. And stupid holes like the daughter who is on the swim team just 'happens' to nearly drown in a lake because she swam too far.
Sorry. No. Superb show with excellent story line. I've been hooked on Season 2 and had to binge watch it. The whole model family thing stuck with the Cartel, just trying to get by, smacks of improbability but it's a credit to the writers that we're able to suspend reality and moreover, realise that passive control freakery of is really just Marty (Bateman) on the verge of losing it completely. There's an interesting change in balance between Marty and Wendy (Linney) with Wendy turning out to be a real snake in the grass, even possibly more psychopathic than the obsessive Justin Bateman. <br/><br/>Ruth (Garner) pulls off an incredibly difficult balancing act too trying to keep her family together in the face of abuse, crazy convict Dad, dysfunctional cousins and her day job in adult entertainment. <br/><br/>End of Season 2 looked like a closure of the series - Wendy has become a Godmother (aka Godfather), Marty is sidelined and Ruth the trusted lieutenant. It seemed a neat and tidy ending.<br/><br/>I hope Netflix give us a Season 3 and the writers can pull off the same level of quality. I hate Neflix makes all the episodes available when the series starts. I can't stop watching! Now I have to wait until next year to see what happens. The writing, directing and cinematography are outstanding. And the acting is just awesome! I can't decide which character I like most. Plenty of suspense and plot twists. Great show!!! It can be difficult to watch this series if constantly comparing to Breaking Bad. After all, it blatantly reuses the same formulaic ingredients: explosive series opening salvo + regular family people + drugs + cartel + millions of dollars + violence + humor + atmospheric music + movie level cinematography + good actors, etc. <br/><br/>And, it utterly fails to capture the Breaking Bad vibe. Yet, it is good (7 out of 10) on its own, which I'll get to shorty, first finishing off my list of gripes, which are its sub-standard story telling and editing. To avoid spoilers, I'll just say that one significant mid-point transitional scene in the opening episode required the writers to awkwardly fill the mouths of the actors with explanations to flesh out the context of what was suddenly unfolding and why, as this pivotal scene provides a major mood departure from the preceding flow of the story and otherwise had scant context to make heads or tails of it, like a whole preceding episode or two were skipped that would have properly laid its groundwork. The scene felt rushed and plot-compressed, and in the back of my mind I could not help but contrast against Breaking Bad's many brilliant crescendos, each whose pace, preparation, and delivery were on par with the finest of Hitchcock/Spielberg craftsmanship. Seriously, can you not imagine hearing the theme from Jaws in the back of your mind while watching Breaking Bad? Well, stop the comparisons now or Ozark won't stand a chance. Oh, and forget the main character arcs.<br/><br/>So, what does make Ozark work? It is closer to reality than Breaking Bad and just by being more real is why it might not be as enjoyable. Jason Bateman and Laura Linney portray what people found such circumstances are probably really like: seedy, of shallow character, with tenuous relationships based on lust for money and sex with a patina of distracting humanity provided by the inescapable fact that they brought children into the world, who are rapidly growing up as weeds in an untended garden, one marked by perfunctory parenting. Let's not quibble. Bateman and Linney don't descend, don't break: they are despicable right at the outset. As other reviewers have mentioned, one is unlikely to be simultaneously possessed of a family-first heart and hedonistic heartlessness. What might have elevated Ozark and established empathy for the characters is its back story, under the assumption that Bateman and Linney were once good human beings. Then, watching them get drawn into their ugly world would have provided interesting fodder for plot and character study that we will never see. However, Ozark hints nothing of a more noble past for either and in such an implicit continuum we can assume these are bad people who deserve their circumstances and struggles. There is no redemption.<br/><br/>So, on with the show. Let's see if it develops like Breaking Bad in reverse: Breaking Good Just the first and last episode was good to be watched
while all the others was about that new man who come the tv show ( i dont want to mention his name :D ) and they ignore all the original characters and make all the season about him and he was crazy and crying all the time haha , come on seriously!!!
and after all his sister help to killed him lol<br/><br/>really? really?<br/><br/>the writer thinking that ( INFANTS) watching his tv show !!!<br/><br/>and by the way from the first season untill the last
the most hatfull and ugly wife and dautgher i have ever seen in this tv show ( the biiiirrrds )<br/><br/>i guess i will not continue watching this tv show any more This is a dark story, and I enjoy it, but I don't understand why Production (or directors) has to shoot almost every scene so dark, especially all interior scenes. There are a lot of "dark" shows on TV, like The Wire, The Shield, etc., but the scenes were never this "dark" and did not have to. I am currently in the middle of season 2 on Netflix, but these "dark scenes" drive me crazy so much that I have not decided whether to continue watching or not. Too many excellent performances to list individually. Absolutely amazing characters. This is the story of a family who, on the surface seems "normal" and incredibly easy to relate to but then you find out what they do for a living. That girl wanna save her lover from mad house then it done the deal and she is not even there with him when he out? how much she love him? and she know how dangerous he is in tat sitiution ... OMG i hate it when logic is gone ... really ..... its not good at all . Its a good show other then this :O This series comes closer to rating a true 10 of 10 than anything I've ever seen. It's THAT good.
Every major character is fascinating and many are very endearing, with one notable exception, that being Charlotte, the Byrds' daughter, who for the entirety of the first two seasons has an ever present chip on her shoulder the size of the Ozarks themselves. I'm undecided if it's Charlotte's character or just the actress, but I personally find her difficult to tolerate.
Overlooking any actors you find annoying, and a trivial handful of scenarios that seem implausible, the show is absolutely phenomenal and impossible to stop watching. This is hands down the most immersive show I have ever seen. It has everything and I quite literally cannot get enough. I could go on an on, but all I'm going to say is give this show a watch - you will not regret it. Netflix better get its act together and renew it for a 4th season ASAP. One of the best series ever. Why would it end like it did?. Please please please can you continue this, I dont feel like it had a proper ending. Season 3 was fantastic ! Incredible acting. The actor who plays Ben Davis definitely deserves an Emmy . Jason Bateman, Laura Lyney and the rest of the cast and crew really did a great job . Can't wait for season 4 What a show, Netflix best show hands down! Please go and watch , won't be disappointed. Hope Netflix can bring in more shows like this. Ozark is a dark and gritty show about a guy who launders money from a Mexican drug cartel. Let me tell you. . . it is awesome!! Jason Bateman's performance is stellar. He fits the mild mannered Marty Byrd character like a glove. The show has a really dark tone with really dark characters. So many twists and turns executed perfectly. We need not to lose time with redundancy.
The dialectic between the family is inspiring as a creative life imitates art job and Ruth and her profanities, character, fearless loyalty is amazing. Congratulations to all, from cast to Directors and writers and all those who have been a piece of the whole. I usually don't give that positive feedback but honestly it was overall a good show. There were some parts that were unrealistic but it actually it was well put together story Bateman is worthy and as I said bring on season 3 and crank the sub The Ozarks!! What an amazing series. Beautiful plot, subplots, twist, cast, characters, story and directing. I love the mere fact I had something to watch that kept me awake all night and day not knowing what to expect or how the Bryde family would survive all the hurdles thrown to them by the Cartel, the Snells and the Langmores while avoiding Federal officer Roy Petty. The movie is truly a turning point for Jason Bateman career. I had goosebumps all through both seasons. I can't wait to watch season 3. Kudo to the Ozark Team The only thing that could make this show better...more episodes!!! This rollercoaster of a show goes from bad to worse to horrible and it keeps you intrigued. Jason Bateman is incredible and Laura Linney is fantastic! Do yourself a favor and watch Ozark I loved this series so much that I could hardly think about anything else.
Exciting, holds your attention and causes you to binge watch like I did.
I give it a big 10 Jump on the wild ride of Ozark. It is a dark crime thriller that stays believable. The leads and supporting cast in Ozark is top class. Ruth makes every scene better with her undeniable presence. The way Bateman and Ruth build their confusing relationship as business partners is thrilling. Everything about this show is thrilling. Bateman is the perfect character for this story line, he makes the most intense and scary scenes seem normal. Netflix your killing it! To be honest I didn't think I would really like this series. I am not a huge fan of Jason Bateman or Laura Linney but they were amazing, as were every other actor in this series.
Its a tense, exciting edge of your seat drama that I could not stop watching, so I didn't. I binged both seasons in 3 days,
Personally I think Julia Garner (Ruth Langmore) played an epic part with professionalisms and true to life acting. She was THE standout of the whole series.
Do yourself a favour and watch both seasons, you won't regret it. Spielberg goes on and on about how Netflix movies, and shows, shouldn't be nominated for awards at any of the Academy Awards, or Oscar's, but Roma got there, and won to boot, and now Steven is going to have to swallow those words because it's shows like these that will replace CBS, ABC and the rest, if Netflix keeps shows like these coming. I would have never guessed that Jason Bateman could be so good, and even direct so well. This show is consistently fresh, and new with each season and leaves you wanting more, I haven't seen something this original come out from CBS or even ABC for years, maybe not even at all if I'm being honest, and I don't think we ever will. Network television, and cable are dying. Only HBO, TNT, and maybe Cinemaxx will survive if Netflix keeps up with these amazing shows. I haven't see a thriller like this, which involves a family it's amazing and I m thrilled and it's very strategic simply based on the survival of the fittest and people would love for season 3 and may be more !!!!! In the vein of "Breaking Bad'' comes a fascinating and authentic crime story about financial advising gone haywire and layers and layers of criminal activity. Amazing performances and twisty story that never gets tired or formulaic. Very good subject, very good caste but the screenplay really bores to death. The story doesn't move and it revolves around unnecessary charcters that deviated from the plot. I wish the screenplay could have been little faster My goodness, Julia Garner (Langmore girl) is fantastic.<br/><br/>What I find most interesting is Byrde family somehow finds an answer to their problem. Either good or bad (mostly bad) at the cost of someone dying, their problem gets resolved.<br/><br/>They give no remorse of killing off some major story characters like a stunt doubles and caught me off guard. I've enjoyed watching them die that way.<br/><br/>
Anyways, this show exists to showcase Julia garner. Congrats. So good and I'm waiting for season three! All the actors are amazing but I especially think Julia Garner is awesome with her character! Great acting, presentation and plot. Just watch it and thank me later. Was bored by a lot of S1 and wasn't interested in watching S2 but glad I did.<br/><br/>Give S1 a 6.5/10 and S2 a 7.5/10.<br/><br/>Not a fan of the blue tone filming in either season and relieved S2 wasn't so blue saturated, hopefully S3 will not rely on blue tones to create it's atmosphere and mood; that's already apparent through the excellent acting, writing and direction I loved the first season, it was nail biting you really didn't know what was what. But after a season a show has established itself, it's characters. Usually reveals how they like to run the show via some kind of formula - in this case it's the almost getting caught or staying one step ahead of the bad guys.<br/><br/>But enough about season 1 this is about season 2 (and my 100th thing I finished watching this year). Season 2 wasn't as good as 1 in my opinion. There were some things that I didn't like that kind of took me out of the moments that were supposed to either build drama or suspense.<br/><br/>This one bugged me, like a noisy faucet dripping, once I noticed it I kind of focused in on it and it started to annoy me by the end. So if you don't want that to happen skip this part. The writers used a tactic with Marty where no matter what scene he was in he "had to go" this was repeated so many times. It got to the point where there was not development of character it was always "gotta go" and most of the time it was a phone call, he would pick it up and then tell the person he was with "he gotta go". This started me down a path were the other things I didn't like started coming to the surface more and taking away from the things I did like.<br/><br/>The daughters story arc was not enjoyable for me. Necessary maybe to add tension to the story. There were very little surprises in this season as I found the writing to be a bit weak, you could see the "twists" coming. Once you watch the whole season you will be able to figure out the formula for season 3 and probably the whole show. It kind of reminds me of Dexter where the main character is "getting away with something" almost to be caught, a nemesis is instroduced early in the season, they battle it out he wins, next season rinse and repeat. <br/><br/>I also found myself rooting for no one in this. Everyone in this show is a terrible person. I know they were probably going for the whole Breaking Bad anti hero thing but in order to root for the good bad guy they have to be likable. The bickering between characters got to be kind of grating. <br/><br/>Having said all that, the acting was great from everyone even the kids. The story arc in general was pretty good and full of tense moments. I liked how Wendy's character develops. But from the weaknesses I have seen in season 2 I am losing hope season 3 will be good. But I will still watch. I was hooked on S1 of Ozark and waited quite anxiously for S2. I am so happy it has not disappointed. The entire cast is amazingly memorable and the story is solid. This season has surely beat the "Sophomore Blues" and I pray S3 continues to entertain, grow, and move us into new ventures for this family. Ozark WANTS to be Breaking Bad. It desperately wants to be like Breaking Bad. It succeeds in the latter, but it is nowhere near as good as Breaking Bad is. This is more a compliment to Breaking Bad than it is a slight of Ozark. The show is pretty good, but although it delves into some hardcore material, it comes up somewhat forgettable.<br/><br/>The main problem with the show is that it is far-fetched and unrealistic in a broad macro sense, but also in a micro sense. Nonetheless, it makes for decent entertainment. The show moves quickly so boring it is not. Is it riveting? At times, it can be, but not on the level of Breaking Bad. The main compliment of the show is that it is bold and daring; if nothing more, you have to give them credit for trying and really working hard to make a unique show, albeit Breaking Bad's minor league brother. <br/><br/>Laura Linney was a great find for this show. You'd bet it took a lot to sign her on, as she seems picky with the roles she chooses. I feel she's a little overqualified in this, but I'm not complaining. Julie Garner steals the show, overperforming for the material at play. Bateman is Bateman, and he does a good enough job with a challenging role, but he is nowhere close in range and talent as Bryan Cranston.<br/><br/>It is definitely worth a watch if you are in the mood for something different, mysterious, and suspenseful, but it's not for everyone. Oark is at times very disturbing and can be a little depressing a little too dark. Although it contains some laughs, they are not as frequent as in Breaking Bad and nor do they possess Breaking Bad's level of dark humor mastery, which strikes a perfect balance. <br/><br/>Season 2 is set to be released in late August. The previews look pretty good so I had to check out season 1. It feels like a divisive kind of show that people will love or hate. I'm somewhere in between. I found it a combination of Breaking Bad, U-Turn, and yes, The Great Outdoors. 7/10 (C) Entertaining enough, especially compared to the lack of quality TV these days. Bateman and Linney make this worth watching but it definitely doesn't live up to its potential.<br/><br/>It feels like the show is going after a Breaking Bad feel and it falls terribly short. My main issue with the show is the lack of realism in every single character, other than Bateman and Linney. It seems just about every scene has characters acting in such a far-fetched way that it's a little difficult to take seriously.<br/><br/>This said, I'm still hoping for a second season as I think the show has potential. The show started strong, had a tone, and my attention, but it fizzled out hard mid season. Stereotype family with the unhappy cheating wife, the wise youngest boy and the rebellious daughter. Batemans character is Bateman in any other movie, except he's a common man with unrealistic bravery during life threatening situations that happen all throughout the season. There are too many antagonists, the FBI agents are completely exaggerated and ridiculous to the likes of the various forms of law enforcement on Sons of Anarchy. The plot is unoriginal writing. I will say much of the dialogue is very natural though. I appreciated that. Overall,watchable, but not great Oh darn, the season 3 curse has hit this show too. Don't know if this is an actual phenomenon, but season 3 of Ozark sucks just like season 3 of Stranger Things did. Both series started really strong and then they fell flat on their faces. The writing is just terrible now and the characters have become sad caricatures of themselves.<br/><br/>The machinations of Marty and Wendy have gotten so ridiculous and over the top it's laughably bad. The stories have gotten stupid and the series is incredibly predictable. I know everything that's going to happen long before it does. No surprises or suspense. Bateman acts like he's on nova cane. The unruffleable exterior thing is just annoying now and completely unbelievable. It's gotten to the point where I hope Marty and Wendy get killed so if the series continues, the focus will be more on believable characters like Ruth and Wyatt.<br/><br/>Should have ended it after one season. I don't want to lecture people how to live, but I'm so tired of producers/writers thinking they have to have wall-to-fall f-bombs for people to watch a show. I find it offensive & repulsive after awhile. The same with unnecessary nudity constantly in our faces.
This was a great concept, had superb acting & writing, but I finally gave up on it. Thanks, Netflix. I don't write reviews often, but this show deserves it all. My expectations were high, and it had big shoes to fill being somewhat akin to Breaking Bad, and I'm thrilled to say it's up there with the best shows of all time. Forget the so-so reviews from New York Times and others. Those guys are cozy with HBO and Amazon Studios, and Netflix bothers them. This show shouldn't be watched from a Starbucks while sipping a latte... just drop anything you're doing because the photography and details is at a level rarely seen before. At high level, the story is sort of familiar and engaging, with believable situations and characters. Many subjects are touched on in realistic fashion: money, religion, parenting, suicide, etc. We were riveted pretty much from 1st episode. But what makes it really stand out is the acting and relentless attention to details. Bateman is awesome in comedies and turns out he's even better here, with his laid back attitude of getting things done under the worst pressure. Laura Linney also makes the show with subtle acting and burst of emotions at the right moments. The kids are very interesting, which never happens in shows. Julia Gartner is a revelation, her character adds a lot. Also Jason Butler is great as the FBI agent. So the story and characters are all there, but still it goes beyond, this show just has a lot of soul. People say it doesn't have humor, it actually has a lot of it, but it's subtle, kind of like twin peaks, where you see weird situations with serious people that become really funny in themselves. Dialogs are great and highly quotable. We found ourselves rewinding a few times because some dialog was cracking us up. Also the cinematography and details is on par with breaking bad, capturing enticing details that catch the eye. To sum up, don't believe the folks that rate this a B, without even watching it or taking it as a background watch. This show is A++ masterpiece. Can't wait for season 2. And I think we'll watch season 1 a few times :) The actress who played Ruth's is absolute horrendous. It's as though she thinks dropping the f bomb an exponential amount of times necessary, it might make up for how pitiful of an actress she is. The southern "twang" is flat out bogus! The story is somewhat interesting but I honestly find a majority of the acting trash. Perhaps if the labeling had been correct, I would have rated it much higher, but calling this a thriller is more than a stretch.
Yes, it starts off fine with some intense moments and very nailbiting stress for the main characters.
After that, it goes downhill and the tempo grinds to a halt. The rest of the season (1) we spend more time exploring the dysfunctional life of the main hillbilly family, our protagonists' trust issues, gay relationship troubles and about 117 other "thrilling" subjects *yawn*.
It feels like the writers of the show wanted to produce a drama, but were forced to come up with some drug-mafia-cartel-badguy sub plot to get the project greenlit.
It¬¥ s a nice show with good acting, especially if you enjoy a slow-paced drama - but it's mislabeled and not even close to being a thriller - unless you¬¥re thrilled by a couple of tense moments every 4 episodes. Season 1 and 2 were superb but season 3 is just perfect. A masterpiece. A work of genius. Just finished the 2nd viewing of season 2, which is just now released. This series confirms great drama is on TV at a level rivaling any theatrical release. In the vein of The Americans or Breaking Bad, this is edge of the seat stuff. It's a classroom about great acting + great writing equals a layered story which could be about a few things. The surface plot about cartels, local crime/financial desperation in the heartland, and greed would be entertaining enough. Strip away the violent premise, however, and this is every family in terms of getting stuck emotionally (see Marty's parenting), disconnecting, and moral lessons. For some families portrayed in this story it could be about negotiating constant financial crisis, mental breakdowns and loyalty, before compliance to systems and laws. Jason Bateman and Laura Linney need no introduction, as the saying goes. There isn't a missed beat from any cast member, and the actress playing Ruth possibly gives the performance of the decade. The body count rises as Ruth inadvertently brings hilarity even with her short but hard knocks life. Are her reactions, much funnier than she means them to be (and not received well by anybody), a way to release some of the tension in each episode? The performances of the children/teens, the characters Buddy and the Snells are incredible. Don't bring the kids, purely adult TV. In my top 5 ever, in the midst of a whole lot of television product. Escape into this series and then think about your problems. Finished watching in 2 days. Don't know how Ima wait another year for Season3 ! I loved this first season of Ozark! My only complaint is that I have to wait for a second season. Jason Bateman is intriguing as Marty. He has this believable way of making people see and understand what needs to be done. Laura Linney's, Wendy, is so real to me. She made me relate to her emotions as a wife and mother. I have been a huge fan of Esai Morales since La Bamba! I actually jumped out of my seat when he entered the scene in episode one. I was heartbroken at the end of this season and he was the villain! I am definitely anxious for another chapter for the the Byrde family. Man, What a show so far! The first episode had me hooked, quick! Thrilling, witty, clever, and that's just Jason Bateman's character. By far his best role. Can't remember which episode, the 2nd or 3rd, Bateman's character is talking with this guy in jail, and the way Bateman tells his story, was so chilling, so calculating, it went from this guy who was in jail, thinking Bateman was some middle class father who knew nothing, to slowly and slowly breaking down to the point where he knows he is "F'd" for a lack of a better term. It gave me chills just watching that scene and chills as I write this. 2 thumbs up for me on this show I stopped after getting too bored in the middle of episode 7 of the first season. The pilt episode was promising but it got bored and slow after that rather quickly. I really wanted to love this series becasue I like the charcters Jason Bateman usually plays. I tried but the feeling of forced too many storylines with not really anything happening and no likeable characters made me lose interest somewhere in the fifth episode. I forced myself to keep watching and hoping but hafl way episode 7 of the first season I gave up. Sorry Jason, better luck next time Egads this is a good series. I was hooked from the beginning (how can you go wrong with Jason Bateman and Laura Linney?), but it just kept improving as Season 1 unfolded. I just watched the trailer for Season 2 and if it's possible, it looks even better than the first season. Can't wait for 08-31-18! The cinematography is decent and the story is 5/10 but the acting is absolutely pitiful. The actress that plays Ruth's kills me. How many times do people think they have to drop the same weak curse words in order to make up for horrendous acting? It doesn't work. I almost puked watching the slack jawed redneck teenager hookup with a geriatric woman. The creators decided they could cash in by trying its best to rip off Breaking Bad. The show is overrated in almost every aspect! Ruth needs to die. I don't understand why people like this show. I watched maybe 5 episodes and it's so freaking boring I can't manage to pay attention, my mind just constantly wonders on anything else because this show is like watching paint dry. Where do all these 10/10's come from? Tries to be another Fargo/Patriot/Breaking bad, but flops. There isn't a character with any redeeming qualities. A good shows has someone you empathize with. You have your obligatory gay characters, kids that know everything, statutory rape, hillbilly drug dealers?, and probably a ton I missed. It is all just a depressing sewer with zero humor added. This show is boring and has literally put me to sleep, which is weird considering the unusually high number of obstacles these characters have to face. I'm on season 2, episode 2 and the story is just getting more and more unbelievable. I have no idea why this show has such a high rating. There are like 5 separate groups of people trying to kill the family for different reasons. LOL. Seriously? The premise itself was unrealistic from the start. This is definitely no Breaking Bad. The challenges that Walter White faced were realistic and all stemmed from one or two places. It's unrealistic that Martin Byrd is stepping on toes and having to pay people off every way he turns. Every time we think he's finally in the clear, a new group comes out of the woodwork. Please. The writers have to keep coming up with new foes because they know the show is boring. Unfortunately, it's not working. Also, why is Martin Byrd incapable of showing a single emotion? Jason Bateman's deadpan affect works better in comedic roles. Here he just comes off as an actor trying desperately to save his career. Now I'm in 6 episode. It's really boring. There is nothing pull you up to keep watching it. So disappointed. If any of you think this is a great story.. you're living in a fantasy world. Small redneck crime family outsmarts the CARTEL and exploits an extremely intelligent Chicago family.... Get a grip. Shotgun to the head of a Cartel Lieutenant getting a slap on the wrist is not only sloppy writing, but pathetic. Whatever keeps ya watching tho.... Acting stellar
Story stellar
Music stellar
Words can't express how amazing this show really is! Honestly!!! This is the best netflix has ever done it's so underrated! Wish a lot more people would watch this. From KC and I love this show. I agree that it reminds me of Banshee, but with better actors and better acting. It has the mystery and direction of Breaking Bad. That combo makes the perfect entertaining experience. Best show on tv now.
You can't stop watching it.
There's too much suspense Really good show. Surprised it *only* has an 8.3. Lots of suspense and action. Hyped for season 3 The writing is flawless. The acting is on point from literally every person on screen. Even in the quieter moments it's gripping.<br/><br/>I'm saying nothing else! Seriously, I don't understand all these idiot bad reviews!
People look into things too much
This is one of the best shows I've ever seen in my life.
Yes season one was better season 2 but season 2 is still amazing!!!! Had me gripped from start to finish
All you bad reviewers need to get a life!
WATCH THIS SHOW YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT. Every second of this show is super tense and interesting. Every action makes sense and is there for a reason, not just for dramatic purposes. I recommend watching this to anyone. Wow, this is so well written and so well acted.
If you liked Breaking Bad or Justified... this is better.
The story is more compelling, the characters are more believable.
I can't wait to see what the third season brings. I'm 4 episodes in. That's usally the amount of episodes I give a show before I decide if I'm going to keep watching. There have been a few things that have happened that have made me interested but it doesn't keep my attention long. This show is too slow for me. It doesn't hook me. So far it doesn't seem like it's really going anywhere. Maybe I'll watch more in the future and if it changes my mind I will edit this review but as of right now I'm not enjoying it much. From the very start to the very end this show will have you on the edges of your seats! Jason Bateman, whom I like a lot and has done great in serious roles before like disconnect, is fantastic! He stars as Marty Byrd he is a financial adviser that is approached by the cartel to launder money. I don't want to say too much. You will feel remnants of Breaking bad. The atmosphere is always tense and filled with a dark undertone. As Mary Bryd is tasked to go to the town of ozark to launder a ton of money with his family's life on the line, Things get captivating and compelling quick. The towns troubled young girl Ruth is a treasure in every scene she's in, especially with Bateman. Each episode blows by leaving you wanting for more. The writers of the accountant did an incredible job on this. Lauren Lilly is superb as usual as is the rest of the cast. Set two days aside and binge this show because once you start you won't stop! This is a nail biter for sure so prepare yourselves! This will be Netflix new monster hit that everyone will be talking about! Until the pussification of males entered into the script.
This BS has got to stop or I won't have anything to watch on TV. I agree that season 3 is the weakest of the 3 seasons but it still has some highlights, season 2 is probably my favorite, and season 1 still holds up. Overall, the show has interesting characters solid writing and directing and is very bingeable 19/10 for Bateman and the rest of the cast. But -16 for Laura Linney. Ruins the entire show. Damn shame.<br/><br/>She plays Dislikeable character and she fails by a long shot to pull it off. Bateman is brilliant in his role and the rest of the supporting actors are equally as good. <br/><br/>Unfortunately just not enough to pull me back into episode three. Love the show and the concept. BUT, sick of the homosexuality scenes, enough already. There are more scenes with the men than with hetero relationships. I see Hollywood is trying to make a statement, as usual. If its not politics its sex. The majority of the world does not see life like Hollywood thinks they do. We live in the real world. We just want actors to act and not be political or politically correct. We hope the series continues, but get off the gay agenda nonsense. Yawn fest, but not at all surprised why the majority of the public like this. I started watching ozark this week 4 days to finish 3 seasons. This is such a great show.
The actors are amazing and the character development is fabulous especially with wendy byrde she starts off an unloved beatem down wife whos seeking attention from her husband but she quickly becomes a ruthless business woman who won't let anyone stand in the way of her fanily getting what they want.
I can't wait for a new season.
If you haven't watched this then you definitely should its an amazing Netflix original I seem to be among a few who found these series 3 only okish compared to series 1 and 2 which were fantastic. It has got too 'silly' and too dark for my liking. The stories which were original now have to be contorted around a theme and then lose some of their originality. I find this to be a common theme amongst box sets, breaking bad and sopranos excluded. Everybody just seemed to be running around these series with their emotions in overdrive, few new characters or stories except boring ben. There are a few shows that put together acting, script, cinematography, everything that just comes together.<br/><br/>Ozark is one of those very special shows. Great plot, twists and turns, outstanding acting, directing. I am not used to gushing about shows, Breaking Bad and Seinfeld to me are the gold standard and almost no shows come close to being in their league. Ozark is one of them. Don't pass it up. I was in the show when i started to watch but in season 3 there were some issues but in the way season gets end ! One of the best of the Netflix Originals ! MUST WATCH üî• Outstanding 10 chapters! Keep u on the edge of your seat.a thriller all the way to the end.
Love the idea of seeing season 4.hope It comes soon!!
Outstanding performances from all!! The Best tv show ever just watch You are understanding yourself season 1&2 is soo good but after two year the greatest comeback
happened with season 3...i say nothing just suggested to watch and enjoy that. This is one of the best shows I've watched on the recent times. Amazing cast and what a great story. They may have deviated a little bit from the main story in season 3 but the ending was next level. Can't wait for season 4...plz don't take longüôè I have noticed a lot of reviews on the internet comparing OZARK with the immense BREAKING BAD but I won't follow that road though there might be some similarities üòâ
This new series is brilliant and definitely a must see ! The blonde needs to tone down her "over-acting" skills but other than that the show is entertaining. nice choices being made throughout the story. Story is well written , acting is great and direction . Very dark and enjoyable series Great thriller. Story, acting and Sound production all superb.
Season 2 is better than the first season.
second on my list of Netflix's best after Fauda.<br/><br/>1. Fauda
2. Ozarks
3. Breaking Bad
4. Narcos It's not Breaking Bad but pacier than Better Call Saul. The leading family in this set up their money laundering base in the Ozark and deal with various dangerous locals, Kansas City politicians, weird FBI agents and a Mexican cartel. Plenty to keep them occupied. Let's get straight to it....this is a bloody good tv show!
It's well acted, well written and very well directed. It's grips you from the start and keeps you hooked. Ozark has that feeling you got from Breaking Bad and has obvious parallels without feeling like a copy.
It does have some draw backs (if I'm being critical) as it does feel portioned up from time to time. By that I mean, it feels like a new problem jumps up each week, just so that the family have something to solve, which they do and (very neatly) by the end of the episode; which can sometimes feel a little forced.
But overall, this is must see television and it is elevated to greatness by some truly incredible performances by Jason Bateman and Laura Linney, plus a career defining and near perfect turn from Julia Garner, who in my opinion is the star of a very, very good show It's a puzzle to me that both series have not claimed more accolades and that none of my friends have watched it. You will not find better character development, plot development, cinematography or shear tension in any other show on any network this year. The acting from every single one of the complex characters is first rate. Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys quality drama with many twists Walked into this serious grippy dark show casually one night. Mind blown after watching the pilot. Cut to four days two seasons later... I not only am fully invested in the world but can't wait for the third season. (Btw, I watch a lot of Netflix TV shows and Ozark blows it out of the park). <br/><br/>The premise itself pulls your right into this crazy dark world that is so twisted and weird but strangely close to reality. It's a lot like House of Cards w.r.t themes but more realistic. So if you liked House of Cards but found it a little far fetched, this would be my recommendation. Of course just like HOC isn't really about politics, Ozark isn't really about money laundering. It's about people at their darkest, and in the case of Ozark, a reasonable rational guy who's sucked into this world and there's no easy way to get out! 
Jason Bateman is the real deal - he not only acted but also directed a few episodes and the result is remarkably good. It's a TV show worth bingeing on becuase of it's singular vision and ability to put you right in the shoes of the characters. They are all fully developed and complex, with real character aches. <br/><br/>P.S. Clear your schedule and buckle up for one hell of a ride. The negative reviews of the second season are predictably harsh. Not quite as good as season 1 agreed but still one of the better things to watch right now. Flawed but still very entertaining and the cast as always are so watchable. This show's fans are delusional or just not very bright when they praise it as "great", "one of the best series ever", etc. I get that bored people in the world are desperate for entertainment and something good, and that would desperately make them wish this show was something as great as they say to try to enhance their lives and maybe make some new friends, etc. but the fact is that Ozark is only decent, and nothing truly great. That is, unless you like stupid, unrealistic, far fetched plots and subplots where characters do things out of character for no reason other than to shock the audience or prolong the season to take up time and bore you to sleep.<br/><br/>Don't believe me; just go to Metacritic, Rotten Tomatoes, or read reputable reviews and you will see this show's cumulative ranks are about 59 for season 2 and about 65 for season 1. That is telling you something. For a show that is so highly praised to not even break the 70% positive barrier, yet dichotomously is also being raved as the "greatest of all time", "as good as (Breaking Bad, Sopranos, etc), that should tell you a lot about its fan base. That's the kind of overall critic score that, with the contrary fan reviews, tells that the show is a lot of out there, unrealistic far fetched garbage, but has a lot of violence, action, and stuff that will appeal to the simple minds and lesser sophisticated minds. But the truth is the show just isn't that good.<br/><br/>You'll get liars (or just not very bright viewers) shilling it saying it is as good as Breaking Bad (by the way, the show is so blatantly and obviously an imitation and "rip off" of Breaking Bad, it can be pretty sad at times, but simultaneously you can't complain as the elements of Breaking Bad are so compelling that any copycat can't go wrong). But it is nowhere near as intelligent or as well executed, plotted, and acted as Breaking Bad. However, I will say that it's a little bit better than Better Call Saul, at least most of the time, because at least there's plenty of action and things happen and early and often in the show. This is the genre it is in. 
 
I would strongly recommend this show to anyone who just wants to be mindlessly entertained and has nothing else to do. That means it's not as bad and a waste of time as most shows out there; no, it is decent, but it's nowhere near the hype being spewed out there by people. The critics got his one right- as they've all mostly rated it, it's a bout a 6.5-7/10 and season 1 is better than season 2. <br/><br/>Season 2- 6.5/10
Season 1- 7/10 I just finished watching season 2. Season 1 one was just as fantastic; both of them are just incredibly exciting.
Jason Bateman has put together a very intelligent bright witty suspenseful thriller, extremely dramatic show. Actors are excellent role fit for characters and they are very believable. Perfect. I can't think of a show that has matched up the perfect actor to play the character. A blend of 2 cultures, add in the tall lady lawyer and the evil Darlene redneck... all of these characters are fantastic. The characters come to life. Absolutely brilliant Jason Bateman. You've got the Rednecks and the criminal Mexicans coming together creating a very potent and volatile dangerous edgy emotional thriller. Can't wait to see season 3. Cheers!! :) Just finished watching season 2. Wow! I can't wait to see season 3. So far this show Ozark has kept my interest. Jason Bateman you've done a great job. Excellent acting. The characters are believable and the show is fun to watch. The Missouri rednecks really come to life full of exciting edgy non stop suspense. Add a dash of Mexicans ...and look out. Crazy and original show!! Wow!! Grab your glass of wine, popcorn and get comfy. You'll enjoy this crime drama. Again cheers to Jason Bateman great job. The last part of S1 got me in serious stress due to the whole mess the Byrdes got themselves into. Picking up right where it left off in S1, in first episodes of S2, I thought to myself: that last part of S1 couldn't be that messy, because here are the Byrdes seemingly doing just alright. By the time I got into the following episodes, I couldn't help myself from getting stressed all over again. Threats and all live-or-die of kind of problems just pay a visit to the Byrdes non-stop. The plot and storylines, not the scenes themselves, are the main factors for inducing such stress. A thoroughly proper thriller. I would definitely suggest re-watching Season 1 if it has been awhile since you have seen it ... Or else read a good recap of Season 1 because everything is tied together and wouldn't make a lot of sense if it's cloudy in your mind. There are alot of characters whom didn't seem important in the first season who play a huge part in the second season. Jason Bateman and the rest of the cast is absolutely great. Something between Breaking Bad and Twin Peaks. Fenomanal and proofs that Americans still can make great series. This show is hands down the best show since the Breaking Bad era. This is easily better than Narcos. This show has everything from mystery to thriller. It's bold enough to show nudity and same sex relations. I hope it will have a lot of more seasons to watch. Undoubtedly the second best show of the summer after the Game of Thrones. 50 mins into the first episode: the agent is talking about the cartel and the Mafia and he casually throws in Muslims in there too out of the blue.<br/><br/>¬´ Mexicans, Mafia, Muslims. We all want to believe that these people are more than they are. And they're not. If they weren't... dealing drugs, extorting businesses, flying planes into buildings, they'd be cleaning toilets.
They're not criminal geniuses. They're pathological liars on the path of least of resistance. ... ¬ª<br/><br/>I mean this is just sad. If you want to promote hatred at least be smart about it. The violence put me off big time. I actually stopped watching it because it was unnecessary and unbelievable violent. For example there is a torture scene of one of the main characters toe nails being removed however in the next scene he is seen walking and driving a car with no pain or limping. In another scene in the same episode there are two character standing next to each other and one of them is shot in the head with a shotgun however there is no blood splatter what so ever....stupid and unbelievable. Tried to watch the 1st episode twice today after seeing the high score i was bitterly disappointed expected something like breaking bad with intense edge of the seat oh no that didnt happen what next kind of script and i honestly cannot make it through the 1st episode and not for a lack of trying i woke up got a cup of coffee sat up and tried again and i just cant went into the 2nd episode and there was absolutely nothing compelling sorry to say dull and dreary i honestly hoped this was the series that would carry me throught this lockdown but seems i need to keep looking My hope was so high when i first saw the trailer but i guess it doesn't come upto my expectations. a few scenes was good beside that all i see is a family running in all episodes. I just wanna doggystyle the wife with her fake stupid smile. Waste of time! I can't even... Season 1 and 2 were exceptionally twisty and oh so good. Actors are amazing, characters are all so real, each with so many dimensions... Plot and writing is insane good. Cannot wait till season 3! I had to push myself to watch this after the first episode. Made it to season 2 and gave up. I don't understand the hype of a programme trying to be the new Breaking Bad. In other words its boring and repetitive. This is literally the best show ever. PROVE ME WRONG!!!! Interesting show but is ruined by horrible gimmicky lighting. No one ever spends all there time in a dark room, even outside on a sunny day. The charters are out of focus or in dark shadow. The show does not need the cheese gimmicks Similar to Breaking Bad in that it has people in a situation outside their normal realm of experience and needing to learn new ways and to grow into their new existence. The characters are drawn very well and everything is done in an interesting way. Lots of turns. Looking forward to the third season. A world apart surrounded by water but not near either coast. Worth watching just for Bateman but stay for everyone else. In the vein of Breaking Bad and Fargo where the line between Good and Evil can become blurred. Love the story line and the great acting. Better than a horrible show like Banshee Two more episodes to go and I am enjoying this series so much. What with Jason Bateman and Laura Linney.. a wonderful story line, great writers, good directing and lovely cinematography..what more could we ask for? I hope we get a second season as the characters are very compelling to say the least. Happy to see a really good series make it's appearance on Netflix after "Gypsy" which I was not able to finish watching because all the characters had no depth and I didn't care about them. Ozark is different and congrats to Netflix for giving us a winner. The writers need to go back to writing school and learn how to end a show. This started of like a train roaring down the track and ended with a whimper. What was so frustrating was they set up so many story lines but didn't give them a great ending. The acting was good though, especially the blond headed girl. She had a great accent and played her role superbly. But the writers just didn't follow through with the beginning. If I was Netflix, I'd can half of them and get some fresh perspective. <br/><br/>Against my better judgement I watched 3 episodes of season 2. Would someone from NetFlix please tell the director that he ruined episode 3 by shooting 90% of it in the dark or near dark. I don't know why someone thinks that it makes a show better by shooting in the dark but all it does for me is make me lose interest in the show because I actually don't know what is happening. It was dark in the church, it was dark in everyone's house and offices and it was dark during the day. I've had enough dark to last me for a long time. I wasn't at all sure about Ozark, but then I wasn't sure about Breaking Bad until halfway through the first season. After episodes one and two, I binged the whole season in two days. The last episode made me fear there will not be a season 2. (Oh please, oh please let there be a season 2!)<br/><br/>The acting is spectacular,not a weak link in a large, mostly unknown cast. I was especially surprised by Jason Bateman's nuanced performance as a guy (like BB'Walter White) who justifies going to the dark side for the "good of his family." Never did I doubt him as a loving dad, or the numbed-out husband whose marriage is on an autopilot system that's rapidly losing power.<br/><br/>For those who have said there are no good guys here, you're right. We are all morally compromised...there is good and bad in us all. The story is played out in many shades of gray that only occasionally turn black. The plot twists and turns kept me saying, "Didn't see THAT coming!" I love the pie chart logo in the opening credits, with symbols for the four major story threads of each episode. This helps keep track of the many plots and sub-plots.My only real criticism is that sometimes the lighting is SO dim, I had trouble distinguishing characters who are similar in age, size and appearance.(But then that just might be my poor vision.)<br/><br/>This is much grittier and gorier than Breaking Bad because Netflix is a subscription channel. They can get away with more. If you thought there was a lot of gratuitous sex and violence in The Sopranos,you should probably skip this show. (For those who object to homosexual story lines, be aware that it was in no way just thrown in for the heck of it.)<br/><br/>Oh yeah...and if you're like my husband, who thought "Lake of the Ozarks" was so scenic he was ready to move there tomorrow...this was mostly filmed around Lake Altoona, Georgia...less than hour from where we live! Thoroughly enjoyed this production. Watched all 3 series in a few weeks. The production was professional and acting superb. Special shout out for Julia Garner who played Ruth. Mexican Cartels, Heartland USA, Guns, Drugs, and God. All is set for a very entertaining series. Add to that great acting by almost every character. But ultimately this is an unserious show. The writing is corporate-lazy with random and arbitrary transitions and a plot full of holes. This story cannot be a version of reality in any parallel universe. But again there are enough goodies here. Have at it. Season 1 and 2 are perfect. 3 is terribly bad. Shocking. Thought the first 4-5 episodes was slow in the first series but boy does it get good after that. Loved every minute off it. Can't wait for season 4. Must watch for anyone üëçüèª I normally see Jason Bateman in comedic roles and I love a lot of his work but he nailed it. I wasn't sure how I felt watching it for that some reason. I'm so glad I gave it a chance. One of the best series I've seen in a long time. I just wish season 4 would come out. Jason Bateman makes the whole show. I absolutely love the series. This has got to be the best series I have seen or,even ever seen. Jason Bateman,right on! Its starts off a little slow in the beginning but PLEASE give it a chance,beautiful intelligent writing and absolutely great acting this is one you do not want to miss!
Watch it! It's getting better after every season. I hope they don't screw it up later. But just completed season 3 and it blew my mind to confetti.... This show surprised me, actually, it did more than that, it shocked me. First, the writing is very good, following the paths of both short and long termed goals - makes it similar, in that regard, to the subject of my title. Normally young Hollyweird script-writers(?) will easily lose sight of story, by embracing shiny agenda nuggets of spite, thereby trampling any semblance of plot under the feet of the tyrannical jackboots of PC. There were a couple short, pointless moments of lament, but I think the honest realization of who was in the White House prevailed limited waterworks to a few tears shed on blank paper. With the quality roadmap of a good script a skilled director only needs talented actors to create a masterpiece. Is this as good as "The Mentalist?" Not yet, I'm not done with the first season. What I have seen so far, this show is extraordinary. I highly recommend viewing this, you will not be disappointed. I want to be upfront. It's a good show. Worth watching.... sure. But for me doesn't live up to the hype. Very predictable at times.....I can name 3 scenes off the top of my head I saw coming....then...it happened....acting is good....Ruth steals the show.....some overacting .....some underacting......and It clearly is influenced by Breaking Bad.....some of the plot is a direct rip off.....I have an issue with that.....It also feels choppy at times.....not seamless like BBad. Anyway.....I believe I'm in the minority....most people are obsessed with Ozark.....I'm not. What happens if there is no choice except working for a mafia this series explains well. It's a story of Marty Byrde and his family who had to wash money for Mexican mafia and how they survived time to time. Brilliant and breathtaking show. Nicely acted with excellent dialogues. If you are a fan of Breaking Bad so don't miss it. Netflix has been suggesting this for what seems like forever, so not sure why it took so long to give it a go... but we were hooked right off!<br/><br/>Marty is kind of a darker version of Jason Bateman's "usual" character (who I typically enjoy). But it's a pretty dark series, obviously - money laundering, Mexican drug cartel, the backwoods Ozarks and all the characters who live there. It's going to be dark, and there's going to be violence.<br/><br/>Joint take: It can be a touch slow at points, and Ruth's cursing is a bit much (literally every other word sometimes), but overall, the characters and their development and intersections make for an engaging watch. Marty, don't be soft on Wendy! If you like Breaking Bad, you would love this. The cast are so brilliant. Jason Bateman directed some of the episodes too. Worth a Watch Love the setting of the Ozark's, real american. Marty (Bateman's) ability to problem solve keeps me on the edge of my seat. There is no getting around the fact that Ozark is a heavy-handed drama, in the sense that it almost redefines the term itself. It's all heavy, kinda dreary, most often ominous and definitely a bummer for anyone who can't live in the absence of big cities. it's all the creepy, hidden stuff that goes on in small towns that no one wants to talk about, mostly because they benefit from the it all in some way, large or small. Everyone in the cast is a criminal or criminal enabler - making them accessories - and the rest are people hiding from things that would probably put them in the same categories if they were caught. It's a lawless land of absolute irony. There's rarely any sunlight - and on rare occasions when there is, you jump up and down feeling like you've just - and finally - the temple of doom. i could go on and on about all this, but I'm sure you catch the drift. FYI, Season 3 was beyond belief dreary, depressing ... and riveting. This is one of the best crime/thriller series we have ever watched! We liked both seasons, as the story really pulls you in. It's suspenseful and mesmerising, kept us at the edge of our seats through both seasons. Yes, it is very dark and ominous, literary and metaphorically, but it really adds to the mood and atmosphere. It's also at the same time psychologically uncomfortable and unsettling, as a proper thriller should be. The acting is just phenomenal and impressive, with characters which are believable and well developed, with lots of depth. Jason Bateman and Laura Linney are remarkable, I was especially impressed how Laura's character progressively takes darker and darker turn, becoming in a way a villain too. The Snells are creepy and ominous, really chilling. Actress Julia Garner is superb, she portrayed her character Ruth astonishingly.
Ozark is not 'pleasant' to watch, it's definitely not relaxing or feel-good. It's a gripping, eerie, scary and edgy thriller. Gantastic, tense , certain realism, beautiful picture and the characters are brilliant.<br/><br/>Wendy Byrde is a mean woman, Nice show ... season 2 a litle bit boring ... nothing new ... there something about this show that is does not work ... i really dont know what is it :( ...the first episodes of season one are the best ones for sure ! I love this series. I love all the characters and the writing. A great acting job by all the cast. Can't wait for series 3 It's highly addictive and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Agree with the user called Serious Mayham that OZARK is 5 exceptional hours of entertainment stretched out to 10. But that's the case with most serialized drama isn't it? It's not about compression and distillation. It's about decompression. Elongation. Which is the antithesis of great drama. <br/><br/>Welcome to the brave new world of longform storytelling, where every narrative has to be a taffy pull.<br/><br/>But the first 2 episodes are definitely suspenseful. And the performances in all 10, particularly by Bateman and Linney, are first rate. And the cinematography is exquisite. The whole thing looks like a well-shot feature.<br/><br/>But the story lets us down. Wow!!! what the loverly Crime thriller. This is one of the best Series i have watched recently. Builds lot of curiosity. Wendy Byrde what a character and Powerful. wonderful direction. Background score is very sexy. Not to Miss act.
I am literally waiting for the next Season. Best tv show ever. I've watched the whole episodes in a one day. Walton Gogins needs to revive his role as Reverend Boyd Crowder. Darlene's ex son Wally could be his son. First two seasons were great. Season three is a waste of time. Poorly written. Far fetched. Too much time wasted on characters that don't matter and situations would NEVER happen.
After two great seasons, this season is an insult to the viewers intelligence.
Hope this is the end of this show. After this season they don't deserve a fourth. I have mixed feelings about this show and in my original review I wasn't certain if I was going to continue past episode six. I'm glad I did, because the acting is for the most part is tight and well done. Laura Linney is great as always and Jason Bateman is as well. <br/><br/>I was harsh in my original review, partially because I was irritated with the countless comparisons to Breaking Bad, a series I love. While Ozark certainly is in the same crime genre and shares some similarities, the two series are fundamentally different in tone, mood, style and writing. <br/><br/>I'm am still bothered by certain aspects of the writing which I have gone into further detail below. <br/><br/>MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD:<br/><br/>The first issue that really rankled me was when the character Ruth, portrayed as a tough as nails, criminally intelligent Ozark local thief took 19K and put it in cheap trailer kitchen cabinets with a lock on it that a 10 year old could bust open with a screwdriver in order to keep her idiot uncles from taking it after they already blew $1000.00 on booze and something else I can't even remember. Of course, she knows they are idiots and yet she makes it obvious where she's put the money. She proceeds to makes ridiculous threats that they better not touch any more of the money. And, as I said, anyone could bust open the cabinets where she stashed the money and that's exactly what her idiot uncles do. Not long after, this same girl rigs up a trap to electrocute a main character and even tests her trap by using a mouse to make sure it works. GIVE ME A BREAK. She's clever enough to do that, but not clever enough to stash 19K in a safe place? Granted, I did think the scene showing what the idiot uncles did with the money was one of the few if not the only funny scene in the show. But all in all, that is what I call LAZY writing. <br/><br/>That said, it is a tense series and worth a watch if you like crime dramas. Since there have been SO many comparisons to Breaking Bad:<br/><br/>Breaking Bad is a solid 10 and I rate Ozark as an 8 taking into consideration all the dreck out there. This drama is what would have happened in Arrested Development if his dad was hiding money from the Mexican cartel. Jason Bateman gives his normal bland accountant with a slight personal defect he did in Juno AD and other project Laura Linney is solid as the uptight wife that burns with passion and the daughter is a rising star. could have been done with a good edit to only 6 episode This time Netflix tried to make the next Breaking Bad by adding some Wolf of Wall Street vibes in the mix and inserting an opening narration which implies the whole series is aimed for American audience only. Frankly, it cannot please even that audience. <br/><br/>Soon after the start it becomes clear that we do not have any good characters here. We have room for character development, but there is no reason to care. We have a guy whose life has so little substance they had to put in bunch of sex scenes which hold no purpose, add nothing to the story, premise, characters nor tell us anything about the purpose of this series. Only thing that is clear thus far is that our main character likes sex. And every bit of pron and sex he experienced is rated pg-13 and is your typical Hollywood sex act. If the sex has such a big focus in it, why not make it romantic or fetish heavy? This makes me wonder to whom is this series aimed for. 13 year old kids who can masturbate watching this while parental controls are on? Just waiting for the next all-clothes-on act since there is nothing else to look forward either. <br/><br/>Since I mentioned Jaden Smith and Wolf of Wall Street, you must be curious to know what these have to do with the series. Our mc talks about money like they do in TWOWS, but with the same philosophical talent as Jaden Smith asks how eyes can be real if mirrors aren't? There is no self-awareness nor reason to laugh at it ironically because the series fails at one more thing; to be extremely bad. If anything, this series is extremely not anything. The saddest thing about this program is that TV is so full of programming about self involved people and this program is no different! We wonder why our society is so dysfunctional when this is a fine example of what we and our children are watching! Instead name Ozark, it should be Problem against Problem. Excellent casting, production and story line. If, like me, you look for shows that keep your mind away from everything else going on in your life Ozark is for you. The plot is awesome, surprises you in ways you would never imagine.<br/><br/>I've never been a fan of series, prefer to watch movies, but Ozark convinced me to continue exploring them. I thought this might be intetesting after a single episode, but there were already a couple of minor symptoms of problems to come. OMG did it disintegrate into a Hollywierd abomination. PC run amok. Within a couple of episodes it had shown its true colors but I somehow held on for 3 more episodes. Don't waste your time! It startes out great but drowned in boring dialog and unrealistic plot twists. And instead of elaborating on the characters and plot lines they already have, they just keep adding new character and plot lines.. And more characters and plot lines.. We could have just some dimensions to the characters and maybe even an actual explanation of how this type of crime actually works..
The color grading is blue - just blue - all the time - blue..
The driving force of the main characters is the threat of been murdered.. But for some reason they seem totally unaffected by other characters been killed I dont watch a lot of drama series and I am very selective about what I watch, but when I do I generally watch it after the series has wound up so that you dont have to tax your brain trying to remember what exactly happened in the previous season.<br/><br/>Ozark season 2 came out in 2018. When I started watching season 3 this year I had completely lost track of what had happened in the previous season. I had to read up on season 2 on wiki and then things started coming back to me slowly though a fair bit of it is still a haze.<br/><br/>Ozark is really good. Unfortunately Ozark is not in the same league as a Breaking Bad or a Narcos. I genuinely hope that they wind it up in the next season or two. If it were not for the sheer acting brilliance of the bloke who plays Wendy's brother this season would have been a letdown for me. He is just phenomenal. I didnt think that I would cry watching a show like Ozark but that scene where he is informed that he is going to be institutionalized was just magnificent acting. There was so must dust in the room.<br/><br/>Ozark for all its flaws is a very well cast show but Tom Pelphrey was head and shoulders above the rest. I dont think I have ever gained any perspective on mental illness from watching a show but Tom Pelphrey is just incredible as someone suffering from bipolar dosorder.<br/><br/>Every season on Ozark they make it look like the stupidity of some individual is going to lead Marty to his end and I just want to slap those people around
( especially his kids). This was the first time I felt genuinely bad for someone acting so stupid. I genuinely had no idea who the bloke is. He looks like a budget Keanu Reeves. Keanu Reeves cannot act. Tom Pelphrey is magnificent. A special shout -out also to Helen Pierce & Laura Linney for being brilliant in Season 3.<br/><br/>This was probably the weakest ending of all the three seasons. I was waiting all along for something to happen and very little happens. Lets hope they don't wait 2 years for the next season and wind it up at the earliest instead of milking it till no one is interested anymore. I think Jason Bateman's character Marty Byrd is as iconic as Walter White. He's a total badass and never uses a gun. This is a great show. Been waiting for season 2 so long and was afraid it wasnt as good as 1 but it is even better! I was surprised to see that this drama had Jason Bateman as a lead because I always had seen him in comedies in which he excelled, i.e., Arrested Development, which , IMHO should never have been taken off the air. That being said I watched the first episode just to see if it could grab my interest. The next thing I knew I had binge watched the whole season. Explosive almost out of the gate and, like a good book that I could not put down, this series was something I could not stop watching. Now I regret that I did because I have to wait till next year to see what happens next. I turned several friends on to this series and all of them loved it and cannot wait for next season as well. Jason if you read this get ready to get your Golden Globe and Emmy. CONTAINS SPOILERS*** It has great momentum. I was immediately frustrated the minute I saw Ruth as the cleaning maid and knew right then and there she was gonna steal that cash. Very accurate depiction in Ep1 of how it would really go down in Chicago crime; the cartel wouldn't give you a second chance, they'd shoot you dead right there and make you into stew, though they'd never put the barrels on a truck LOL So that part where they found the teeth, was a farce. The FBI would have been following him from day one of his bank withdrawal. <br/><br/>Anyway, I hate the rednecks and HATE JULIA GARNER. God she's such a cringe actor, I wish she'd go into another line of work. And will they ever buy a f**g gun?? I mean come on. <br/><br/>Anyway, yeah people in the bible belt are some of the most close minded persons on earth and this show does an amazing job of showing just how hard it is to come in and try to make the area better with business. Im having the same problem with idiots in Arkansas, so seeing this show portray EXACTLY the way of life there is refreshing. <br/><br/>I think Agent Petty is going to be killed along the way, and the cartel is going to keep it's leash right around Marty's neck. I think this show is entertaining, and well written. Excited to see where this goes. So yeah, thanks to the home quarantine, I had a time to watch 3 seasons in a week. From the beginning I knew that this show will be a good, I don't even watched a trailer or anything, It's just blew me away particularly season 3. Can not wait for season 4. Loved the actors and the storyline, always had something happening to keep my interest. One of my favourite shows so far. This is awesome. Love it. Not like anything I've watched before. So many twists and turns...it's hard to work out exactly who the good guys are and who the bad guys are. Complex characters and storyline. Can't wait for Season 3. OK. I just completed watching the season 2 finale and Oh my god..it was amazing. I recommend everyone should watch Ozark. It is mind-blowing with the twists,dialogues and many more. We definitely need a season 3 for this series. The more we watch the more excited we feel. This is my personal opinion. I hope it helps you. A very tense, tight and intriguing series. Each and every artist did justice to their role. Ruth(Julia garner) is really a surprise. I am waiting more from her. Lot of tension going on especially in last few episodes. It's like at one point you might want to take a break and have some fresh air. Lot of unwanted twists which making it more tensed. 
But still, I'll be waiting for next season. About a family that moves to a small place to launder mafia cartel money via building a casino. A lot of dysfunctional personalities around in the cast and basically everything that can go wrong also do that. As the family struggles, they are digging the hole constantly deeper.<br/><br/>Quality drama. Quite slow paced still very tense with well written quite complex storyline and very good development of characters. The action and violence is there, though it is not an overload of it, rather the threat and terror is lurking constantly in the background. And then suddenly it shows up now and then.<br/><br/>All actors are doing a terrific job and especially Laura Linney and Jason Bateman are a fantastic match in their partnership in crime and deception.<br/><br/>The ending of season two was perfectly ambiguous and open ended to leave room for a continuation.<br/><br/>However the color grading of season two is far too dark, in a muddy dark green and blue toning. I hope they change this for the next season.<br/><br/>This is a very high quality drama recommended to watch. Some have made comparisons with Breaking Bad. There might be similarities in the complexity of plot development, however Ozark is considerably slower, less violent and bit more subtle. Possibly the best on Netflix right now and a very highly recommended watch if you like these kinds of dramas.<br/><br/>I didn't rate it a ten, since we nowadays are quite spoilt with high quality TV series, but the nine rating is solid.<br/><br/>I really look forward to the next season<br/><br/>Update March 2020: After watching season three I have lowered my rating from nine to eight. Reasons are that it seems the show now is threading water and the storyline is quite bland with too little complexity and twists with the exception of the very ending. Ozark is suffering from difficulties of renewal to keep the interest up. As with many TV series today season three and onwards often are disappointments. There will surely be a fourth season but I am not sure I will spend time on that. This series is so real, the acting superb! I got lost after watching series 1, since 2 came out. But caught right up after only a few episodes. It just got better and better. Binge worthy. One of the best Netflix originals l.
The story buildup and the characters maturity overtime is wonderful. You may hate or dislike some characters in the beginning, but they all grow in a nice way that fit thier roles.
Enjoyable in every minute. Love the show!! Smart, captivating, intriguing etc... 
Good job Netflix! This will be my first review on IMDb as I do not normally post reviews, but I was so entranced by this show that I felt it deserved praise. I was hooked by the first episode of season 1 and it only gets better! After binge watching season 2, I'm left reeling for more. The acting, storyline, and cinematography is fantastic! Jason Bateman gives the performance of his career and Laura Linney is a powerhouse portrayal of her character Wendy Byrd. Actress Julia Garner is by far my favorite in the cast. I can't imagine anyone else in this role. I can't wait for season 3. If you're looking for one show to sink to your teeth into, this is it! Season 2 of Ozark takes off right where season 1 ended, and it is even better this time. All characters are back with Jason Batemen doing an awesome job on screen and behind the camera. If you loved season 1, then you will love this one as well. The Navarro Cartel is not the only problem either, there's another force trying to take the Bryd family down as well. The only thing that is bad about this season is that there weren't 20 episodes The comparisons to 'Breaking Bad' are on point as far as a middle-aged family man being thrown into a no-win situation. The series tests how far a father/husband will go to protect his family when there's nothing to lose.<br/><br/>The characters and story-lines are compelling. Definitely a series that's binge watch worthy. And forget about the Jason Bateman you know from Arrested Development and Horrible Bosses, Ozark shows a well-rounded actor that fits perfectly into this role.<br/><br/>As some have noted, this is a very adult drama. There are extreme intimate homosexual and hetrosexual scenes that may not be for everyone. IMO these soft porn scenes are unnecessary this is par for the course for most series these days. But if you are uncomfortable with these scenes it's easy to fast forward through them. This was an amazing series. Jason Bateman, aka Marty Byrd, does an awesome job in his role! I watched this straight through! It was very suspenseful and kept me watching and anxious for the next episode to see what happens. Started looking to see when Season 2 is coming out and realized that this one was just released. Hurry up with the next season, Please. If you loved the initial 2 seasons, please do yourself a favor and don't watch after episode 6 or 7. Its quite good in the same vein as the first 2 seasons until a separate Ben saga starts. I am not watching the next season for sure. This show should be called...<br/><br/>POWER CORRUPTS.
It has all the bad elements of all that is wrong and corrupt...when you deal with money from drugs you deal with the lowest of the lowest element of humanity..
This series are a bad influence on anybody that watches it.. I in second season almost finish , and still waiting for somethong will happened to much talking We live in an area of North Georgia, U.S. of A. where much of this series was filmed and some scenes were filmed in our neighborhood. Our neighborhood was abuzz each time last year when the crew was filming nearby so we were mondo excited to see this series come out. Over the past two days, we binge-watched the entire series and absolutely loved every episode with the exception of the back story episode which was a slog to get through. Of course, we were delighted each time we recognized our neighborhood but beyond that feature, we loved the writing, the acting, the production values and the characters. This is an outstanding series in all respects! Bateman and Linney carry the weight effortlessly and we have been fans of both for quite awhile. Esai Morales is excellent as well as Harris Yulin as the downstairs neighbor. Most, if not all, the supporting cast are excellent. Finally, we cannot wait for Season 2. I like the show but do you really have to say the f-bomb in every sentence? I had to stop watching after the fifty first one in the first episode. If this is normal to talk like this then we are a sad and disturbing culture. No wonder America is on the down side! This show had the potential of being good but somewhere along the way things went all wrong. I can understand Jason Bateman's enthusiasm to portray himself as a "serious", "Emmy worthy" actor but he would've been smart to cast someone else instead of himself for the main role as he is one of the weakest links of this show.
The script is mediocre and often unbelievable (on the verge of being absurd)
Laura Linney's performance is annoying and way too melodramatic.
Episodes are way too long and would've worked better as a 45 min eps.
The one good thing about this show is the setting and the photography. One of the top shows on Netflix no doubt. I don't know if it's such a good social message to make drug dealers into heros like in so many of these shows.
Season 3 was tight like the first two seasons, but come to episodes 9 and 10, it just goes downhill into a sappy, soap opera with non-stop bawling, hystericals, just not aligned with the cool taut atmosphere the show had managed to create. They give too much screen time and importance to Wendy and her bipolar brother Ben and gets super annoying after a couple of his bipolar episodes..that the show becomes about him in the end. Marty is just hangin around like a useless clown. Anyway, I think 3 seasons is enough as the actors have also aged a lot especially Linney and Darlene. Similar to breaking bad, but without the
Ridiculus over the top villains and with the typical Swedish forest setting. Come to Think of it.. Ozark has alot incommon with the Swedish thrillers J√É¬§garna etc.
Ozark is 90% drama, but the dialogue and story doesn't make sense in so many scenes. It just doesn't schtick! Characters switching from smart to really dumb. And back and forth.
We have this three young poor kids, that ends up on the friendly side with the family, but none of the family members really does anything to help them. It comes of so wrong that bateman winks her away everytime she tries to reconcile, and then she gets in new trouble. Expecially when her criminal father starts messing around.
Then we have the mexican borderline psycho kingpin. Terrorising the family. Threatening to kill children, killed the batemans best friend, almost killed his wife, torturing them, sending a assassin on them etc. And when he FINALLY dies! Bateman gets angry! Really weird scenes follow, like they where best friends. I would take the southern farmer drug dealers any second a day. And he should see as great opportunity to really get rid of those gangsters, but no..
There's alot of these really dumb decisions that makes the show plausable and well.. yeah It gears to really stupid!
When they let wilkeys mess with them.
When the Blue cat inn Lady comes back after stolen alot of money and spend it on drugs,
driving for the road etc. And Bateman just takes her back?? Not even questioning her?
When they spray the Snells car with hundreds of bullets and only one shoulder wound?
When the daughter wants out (how annoying she may be.) and bateman and wife sitting on a mountain of money and they can't fix a secure life to the daughter? She also had a new identity and pass and everything for this occation?? Bateman just paid a flight and and rescued the dryg lady from the Feds, gave her lots of money? But they can't help their own rebel daughter?? And perhaps the worst ending to season 2 ever. A betraying psycho hag biatchh. Betraying ger family like a monster psycho egotistic no symphaty worst wife ever.
As I'd say the show tend to focus to much on things that's really not important to the overall story.
Perfect to coffee bingewatching but a masterpiece? An 8? Never.
Julia garner Is a Tour de force in her performance and the sole reason I'm
Watching Ozark.
And when the The series pushes the idea that there are Mexican drug cartels that conteol flow of illegal dope. More likely is that very powerful drug "cartels" are well-known Wall Street companies that control both street and "legal"opiad-based drugs. Creation of the Mexican boogeymen is misdirection. Jason Bateman directed this series in the same manner that Matt Damon and Ben Afflect "wrote" Goodwill Hunting. Bateman is a child prodigy used as a vehicle to hide an agenda. He and Matt and Ben are, if you look closely, replicas. They have identical facial features. But then I've said too much. Think Bokanovsky, Love this show . Season 2 is very very goooooodddd Waiting for season two of this gem has been ROUGH. I watched the entire first season in one sitting. When it was over, I fell into a deep, dark depression, because I knew it would be ages before the creators would bless us with new episodes. "Ozark" easily holds its own among the greatest crime dramas of contemporary television history. The show artfully blends the complicated family dynamics of "The Sopranos" and the frenzied, desperation of "Breaking Bad." Jason Bateman, Laura Linney, Julia Garner, and Esai Morales are exceptional. While I love Bateman and Linney and what they both bring to the table, I'm not sure how believable they are as a couple. That is totally nitpicking though. The show is a masterpiece. I cannot wait to lock myself in my man cave and binge season two. I've watched the first 3 episodes so far. Gripping and well developed story here. I'm very impressed. Jason Bateman's one man show. IMO Laura Linney was too old for the role and her effort wasn't up to mark. overdose of "Men loving men". Why do viewers have to be forced to watch it when same story could have been easily told without? <br/><br/>5 for Jason Bateman and minus 5 for "men love". Was looking for something edgier to watch . Fed up with House of Cards, only watched first episode in new series. Stumbled on Ozark. Told myself I would just watch first 15mins . Ended up watching 3 episodes back to back. Acting is excellent from all the cast and all the characters add their own mix to the story. Bateman runs the show though. Looking forward to Season 2. This is the perfect show for Jason Bateman. Everything else comes back to that first sentence. Bateman is great in almost everything he does but I rarely feel that he is utilized in the right movies.<br/><br/>Ozark is classified as a crime/drama/thriller. It is also darkly funny. Bateman brings his dry sense of humor to the show in a big way and the writing is perfect for him. <br/><br/>The show itself sets a good pace with decent characters and character growth. I am excited to see what happens in season two and think you should catch up if you haven't already. An excellently paced, well written crime-thriller. I really liked the sharp contrast between Marty's deadpan realism and the bad-man's-over-the-top-exposition on morality, his father or career.<br/><br/>One can assume the show takes itself too seriously but a closer look reveals subtle, shrugged, deadpan non-reactions from Marty (Jason) on major events that he's resigned to any idea of normalcy and takes life as it comes (and this is mentioned by him several times).<br/><br/>Also, I love any series where they take the role of kids seriously, who aren't just set pieces that move around the set as 'adults' do the dirty work.<br/><br/>Admitted this review is biased as I'm a fan of Jason Bateman from the days of Arrested Development. If you are a fan of AD, you can notice his comic resignation; i.e. 'this-is-my-life-now' moments which make this series a treat to watch.<br/><br/>The last episode embodies the show's style pretty well. One of my favorite shows. Definitely binge worthy. The characters are brilliant!! I never rewatch a series but about to rewatch ozark because it is THAT good! Ozark is an incredibly interesting series it makes you keep watching episode after episode
It's very unpredictable you never know who's is going to die I can't wait to see what season 4 will bring. Initial few episodes looked a bit of drag, and I had almost left it after watching first few episodes of Season1, but then someone appreciated the Season 3 highly and I restarted watching it. And OhMyGod, what a Series it turned out to be!! Season 3 was absolutely mind-blowing, what an gripping, thrilling turn of events!! üëèüëèüëç I love this show! always entertaining and never know what is going to happen next! Season 3 is sooooooo goooood! From EP 1 in the first season till the tenth in the 3rd i saw it absolutely perfect, Acting , directing , almost everything , thanks for that masterpiece ... I really like that outstanding performance by Julia Garner (Ruth) , Go ahead guys keep that perfect work going on If you want to death in the eye, go see the eyes of Jason Bateman from Ozark.
If you want to see a how mind of a manipulative person works, go see the Windy.
That's how awesome this show is. You always root for the bad guys on a show like this Bateman and Laura Linney are excellent in the lead roles, the young Ruth is great.
The writing is brilliant, casting is great, characters are interesting and pacing of story is just great.
The setup is so straightforward and direct, and the twists and turns just keep unfolding.
Unpredictable but not absurd or unbelievable.
Finally a series that doesn't descend into a daytime soap opera... with the unfortunate exception of the FBI officer...
well done. Before talking about stories, plots, subplots, cinematography and everything else, I would just like to emphasize that how great and wonderfully ALL the character archs are created and handled, everyone gets solid time and has tons of unique traits; seen in very few series nowadays.
Now, about the storyline- it's not the most unique or gut wrenching but it's enjoyable and will pleasantly keep you invested.
All the shots were beautifully done and well edited. Although sometimes they overdid some filters, the overall feel was quiet authentic.
It's totally worth watching,you will love it more specially if you have affection towards shows like breaking bad, narcos or weeds. I just read Ozark may not be returning?!!! No way! Such a brilliant show! All of the actors are phenomenal & the entire theme is mature, interesting & plotted out beautifully. Please help me understand why we ignore intelligent shows that are very creative & mind explorative? I stuck with every episode and although there are some odd characters and some situations that were difficult to believe, I have enjoyed it. I'm not a crime boss, but I feel that Marty's family would have been brutally murdered a long time ago. Not a fan of Laura Linney. She just seems to old for Bateman and over exaggerates her character. That got annoying. A different actress would have made it more enjoyable for me. Come to think of it, the actors that portray Marty's kids were not real likable as well. Maybe I should restate my review then. Love the story line, actors need a do over. It's too dark. Not the subject matter, but the actual cinematography is way too dark to watch properly even at night with all the lights off. That's frustrating. Even gives me a headache from the eye strain of trying to see the action. Sometimes the people's faces can't even be seen. I have to go by their voice. When writers run out of ideas they start adding props like automatic weapons that shoot blanks and characters who get stabbed, machine gunned and minced in shredders but somehow manage to show up later without explanation. Kinda like The Man in Black in "Westworld" who gets gut shot 7 times but manages to get back on his horse and ride into the sunset. Can't suspend disbelief on those kinda things. The only prop missing from "Ozark" is a Jumping Shark fishing derby. But there is also one character that disappears: The Cartel. On season 1, the Cartel was a Jumping Shark fishing derby fish cleaner with a really sharp knife gutting sharks and machine gunned characters that stayed dead. A really malignant fish cleaner, gutting left and right. In season 2, the Cartel turned into a minnow on the end of a hook as bait for jumping sharks. Yeah, just like that....<br/><br/>Really, I stopped watching BB like three quarters of the way through the series, but this I am just enraptured with. Between the incredible cinematography of this and Sex Education, Netflix is killing it.<br/><br/>Just waiting for season three. Cast, crew and writers conspire to produce a brilliant Shakespearean drama so tragic proportion. Reccomend I was never much of a Jason Bateman fan, but he really nailed this role, his character's exasperation, short temper, and ability to talk himself out of any situation are entertaining. As good as he is, Laura Linney brings her incomparable acting skills to the game, always thinking two steps ahead of everyone else...she has to, in order to survive. Her every inner pivot of maddening desperation is displayed on her marvelous face as she goes from one situation to another, trying to make the best of her circumstances. But my hat goes off to the versatile Julia Garner, who I hope has a long and successful career as an actress, she is almost unrecognizable when you see her in other tv shows such as Dirty John or The Americans. In Ozark, she matches with with Linney and Bateman, constantly scheming to get one over on them. This show clearly isn't on the same level as Breaking Bad, with which it has a similar premise, but it's a close second. My only complaint is that I wish they would slow the storyline down and lengthen their story arcs, some characters come and go very quickly. Great show! If you are into people getting in over their heads and how they figure it out, this is the show for you! Good show, dark ambiental. It has it's moments. I really enjoy it, waiting for season 3. This is as good as Narcos or Cocaine Coast.
The showing of the money loundering and the cartel crime is fascinating. Really good, recommend it. I'm a huge fan of Ozark with the exception of the hormonal teenage daughter. I understand that she's there to add another layer of suspense, but her whole storyline is off putting by the end of season 2. There's enough drama without her personal turmoil. This little crime drama tv series about a money laundering family making moves for survival had me on my couch for a good part of the available productive time I have for myself. The premise is so fascinating, and the cinematography is so mesmerizing that it keeps you hooked despite any moments that may seem slow. Laura Linney's performance is multilayered, and there's a hint of lust for the crime life in her demeanor. Jason Bateman kicks ass as the wise talking head of the family who although an immoral person for his involvement with a brutal drug lord, is extremely witty and always under control, even when he is really freaking out. Perfect casting for all of the supporting performances, engaging writing, and great pacing. Check it out for your couch's sake. Ozark is a brilliant hybrid genre that hits a home run in each and every episode. Whatever mood I bring to watching it, is the mood I take away! Incredibly well created and written with Justin Bateman serving in episodes as director, the show captures every moment of a lateral fictional existence that seems all too normal yet crazy (not to mention laughing out loud hilarious) to not want to be a part of...Even if it's only an hour at a time. Why have I only just stumbled across this perfect little gem of a program. Really cannot think of anything much negative to say about this suburb Netflix series. I thought nothing could ever beat Breaking Bad (the first four series), but this series does. Jason Bateman - where have you been? Teen Wolf in the 1980s and then a huge gap until Horrible Bosses (great movie)....and then you come along with this pearler. Your talent was wasted for so many years.
Almost all the actors in this series are brilliant and most the characters, even the bad guys, are likable. Laura Linney is fantastic, as is the actor who plays Ruth. If I had to choose I would say Series 1 is better than Series 2, but only slightly. Just can't wait for series 3. I have been wayching the first season over the last week and cannot stop watching it.Jason Bateman, The Director has done an excellent job keeping the show tense,intelligent with a "I want to watch more" kind of vibe. Loved it from season one. Rewatched it twice before moving on to season two so I knew exactly where it left off because they don't do recaps before each episode. The tone of the series is dark but gripping, and it has been an intense ride throughout. Thank you, Netflix. I loved season 1 but season 2 is even better as the plot thickens and the story line deepens. Many of the fringe characters from season 1 are expanded upon in season 2. You get to know their motivations and moral compass (or lack of). The Cartel lawyer was excellent and Linney .... wow. She was such a sour puss in the 1st season but really shines in season 2. Trevor Long (Ruth's sociopath father) is terrific, as is Ruth herself (Julia Garner). The Snell's are as ruthless as ever and the Byrde family becomes more dysfunctional as the kids become more involved. Without giving anything away, it's a great series to binge watch. You won't be disappointed. It's an awesome thriller drama series .. not slow at all ..love the story the writing, the director .. and awesome work by the cast For those who have long seen Breaking Bad, this series comes to refresh the memory, not with someone to manufacture narcotics, but the prospect of an intelligent man. The man who does unlawful things. Best TV show i ever seen!!
highly recommended.<br/><br/>cant wait for next sessions....... Season 1 of Ozark was a fantastic watch. Really edge if your seat gripping. The storyline of season 2 has been equally, if not more exciting. However, the lighting of the majority of the shots is terrible. It's as if the decision was taken to save money on light bulbs! So much if the show has been shot in darkness that, for a great deal of the time you are simply listening to talking shaddows. This has been a real off putter for me in season 2, but fortunately the story is so good that I was convinced to stick with it. <br/><br/>Just to clarify, the darkness is not limited to one screen hence, it is not an issue with the TV. The show is hard to watch on phones, TV, and tablet. Hope that this can be sorted out when the story continues in season 3 which, despite my grumbles, I am very much looking forward to. This series will grip you from start to finish in EVERY episode. The situations he gets into are tense and uncomfortable, but you get this sense Jason will somehow get out of it. The cast are amazing - great acting all around. The hillbilly couple are by far my favourites and I like how their back stories are explored rather than being 2 dimensional baddies. Can't wait to see season 3, keep them coming! Best show on Netflix (imo). Get past episode 4 and you'll be hooked! Never really gets dull. Thrills are almost non-stop. Amazing acting, direction, and story. Watch it!!! This is the best show I've seen in years. After Breaking Bad and House of Cards, this show definitely earns a seat at the round table. It's gripping, witty and edgy. Great acting and good scenario .Besides, it is very good practice for all episodes to be published on the same day Ozark is dark, gritty, well paced, and will turn your knuckles white from time to time. The first season delivers the goods and with smart writing, it leaves you wanting more. Yes, elements will remind you of Breaking Bad but not in a copy cat sort of way. 
 Jason Bateman always seems to play himself in other shows and movies, which works. As Marty Byrd it's not much different. Yes a character that's a little more disturbed and stressed, but still Bateman's familiar style. Bateman pulls it off and this may be his best work to date. 
 Season 2 somewhat slows down, but it might be better to say it settles in gear and continues the story with fluidity. New problems and new obstacles are realistic and satisfying, while character nuances are achieved. It's hard to say how long the show can keep going, but the setup for season 3 presents a thirst that I fear won't be quenched until next August. Absolutely love this show! On the edge of my seat the whole time! Ozark holds your attention from the first episode of Season 1 and never lets go. I found it addicting and it was hard to limit myself to one episode per day. Many elements of Breaking Bad, with the main character who starts out as a regular suburban husband and gets drawn into drug dealing, money laundering,murder, bribery and about a half a dozen other crimes, all the while dealing with a viscous Mexican drug cartel and trying to keep his family together.
Outstanding production in every way ; I didn't want it to end! Suspenseful! Acting is top notch from all of them! And Ruth! Omg, love her! Horrible people leading horrible lives, that's my lasting impression of Ozark. <br/><br/>This is not a series for everyone. Its not only dark in terms of its subject manager, its visually dark too. Sombre blues and shades of grey inhabit this series reminding me of the kind of visual metaphors set up in The Godfather. The comment "camouflage is a colour" works beautifully in this context. Nothing is what it seems and everyone is hiding something.<br/><br/>The dynamic between people is predictably fraught, with a palpable a tension that never really goes away. Even the Ozarks scenery does little to dampen things down not helped by the endless, at times arbitrary harm inflicted on imperfect but in some cases fundamentally harmless, people. <br/><br/>The downside of the this series is in a sense its upside. It's heavy viewing which I could only manage in small doses. By no means one to binge watch. My other criticism is at times, its somewhat implausible. Actions taken by for example underworld figures, who want to stay out of the public eye, are, at times, inexplicably public and messy. <br/><br/>That said, I would suggest this is a decent if not exceptional series in most respects. but will by no means appeal to everyone. If you liked series akin to Banshee this may be for you if not it may be one to pass over. 7/10 from me. Having watched both seasons, I would say the main difference was that season one was about deloping characters while season two is much more about developing problems. Increasing amounts of drug cartel money are now being laundered, always with the promise of bigger and better plans. However, more money, is more problems; and Marty Byrd and his family are beginning to crack with the strain. Season two brings a few new characters, the best being the cartel's new lawyer. She is ruthless and a better replacemnet for Marty's previous cartel contact who did not survive being rude to Mrs. Snell. 
It occured to me just how much the writers are influenced by Machivelli's - The Prince. That famous book is the user manual on how to manage successfully, if your operation is a minow swimming in a world of competing superpowers. Marty Bird is Machivelli's prince, constantly using one superpower to block one of the others from killing him, someone needed or someone dear to him. The competing superpowers being the Navarro cartel, the Kansas city mob, The Snell hillbilly sanctuary, the FBI, and Missouri State government.
By episode six or season two, I was getting a little tired of these continual problems of his, but season two redeemed itseldf with a climatic finale spread out over the last three episodes. Never seen a better series on netflix since breaking bad. I loved season one but season two is doing my head in.
Seems rushed and too much unnecessary drama. A few holes in the story appeared as well.
Season one a solid 8/10 but season two falls to a 5/10.<br/><br/>Season 3 was as good as season 1. I really like this series, but in the second season almost every scene takes place in almost total darkness. By episode 5 I just wanted to scream "turn on the lights!" I rarely watch any series, but Ozark is an exception. This show is excellent. Great story lines, interesting characters, and frequent plot twists. I just started season 2, and I find that I can't wait to watch the next episode!
My favorite characters so far are Buddy and Helen, the cartel lawyer. She's a tough, mean cookie.
They do a great job of ramping up the tension; I don't know who is coming after who next. I often sense the same fear and tension the characters sometimes face.
Great show. I loved this series from the first episode. The casting is perfect and I couldn't find one little fault with it. I watched this series on the initial basis that Jason Bateman was in it and I thought he was great in Arrested Development, but to be honest everyone of the cast in Ozark are brilliant. I have looked on the internet and cannot find out if a decision has been made to do series 2. Please put me out of my misery and say yes. In my humble opinion this could go on for many series. Only a couple shows hold a 10 for me. Thrones and breaking are the only 10's. I have a decent amount of 9's. This show gets a 8.5 from me. Almost a 9. I brought that up because this is very similar to breaking bad. I think the show has even more potential if another season happens. I mean this was just starting up with only one season. I like bateman in this role. I hope he can become a little more bad ass as the show goes on. I know they want him to be the "nice guy", and i don't want him to be as "kingpin" as walt was, but still a little more badass-ness. But with all that sad, i still really enjoyed this show, it was done well. You wont regret watching this. Bateman is an average actor, or slightly below in this kind of role. He is good in the sarcastic dead pan comic role, like in A.D. back in the day. The problem is when he gets put in dark, scary situations he doesn't seem upset enough, and you keep expecting him to drop a punch line. Casting him in this role would be like putting Shirley Temple in "The Bad Seed", or Jennie Mcarthy in "Sophies Choice". he has to learn how to sweat for one thing. Having you and your family in near death situations has to have you sweat. his family put in these harrowing, implausable situatins only works with either really good acting or an audience under 12. Otherwise it all adds up to too implausable and highly mediocre, and a grade of C+. It'sa shame because they spent A- money on it, oh well Sis and Scooter just don't make it happen.<br/><br/>The small firm Bateman works for gets approached by a criminal who wants them to launder large, actually huge, sums of money. He initially says no, but of course consults his wife played by Laura Linney, being the perfect family man that he is. They take the criminal's offer , and things eventually go very, very south.<br/><br/>The show has average acting, and semi developed characters. What keeps this show from being great is that it is basically the same story we have seen countless times in recent decades. Breaking Bad, Fargo, The Shield: Near perfect family man will do ANYTHING for his family, nuclear family that is.<br/><br/>His motivation is not loyalty to his parents, siblings , lifelong buddy who saved his life in battle or even himself; he lives to protect his wife and kids, and he will do anything to insure they are safe. He can rationalize doing anything no matter how many people it hurts. He is completely and totally selfless. No cars, women , or drugs for him (even if his wife cheats); he is a family man drone, and blames himself for his wife's cheating, corroborating the Hollywood mantra "women and kids deserve respect, men don't matter".<br/><br/>Another problem is portraying the Mexican drug Lord as preachy and judgmental about anyone who cheats on his wife. They show this guy kidding about being turned into a cobrone by his wife and Linney (she might leave me for her). I just can't buy a murderous drug dealer as wanting to be cuckolded and laughing about it.<br/><br/>The notion that protecting your wife and kids is so noble it transcends consideration of everything and everybody may be the Hollywood dogma of our time, but even in fiction the dark side can can bleed through. What is that they say about the road to hell being paved with good intentions? This is the best series on Netflix since Breaking Bad. I would give it 12 out of 10. Jason Bateman best performance ever- he is amazing in it. I couldn't stop watching the show and binged watched the entire series over the weekend. Great writing. Can't wait for season 2. You just have to watch this! If you were a father or mother, business man, , age 30+ , love a good story. It's hard not love Ozark. <br/><br/>If you are too young to understand the responsibilities of the character, and looking for something ( fast pace ) you'd probably hate it. This is not good to watch on the phone. Ultra HD is the best way. <br/><br/>I understand all the negatives reviews. They just don't get it and start to find the stuffs they don't like and blame on those stuffs for their lack of understanding. Ozark is a kind of series where you feel things going on when you're watching it and then when you take a step back, you feel like the story hasn't gone any far. Honestly if I starting comparing Ozark to Money Heist, I seriously think the director of Ozark would take 4 seasons in 10. But hey, it's Ozarks in Missouri not Paris in Italy. Ofcourse it's slow. Coming to Season 3, the show gets a little too dragged. There's this therapist that Marty and Wendy byrde visit for Counselling who talks so slowly that makes you feel like she's slower than the series itself. The mandatory twist they show in the Finale was predictable. This show is perfect. Very similar to breaking bad for me. I'm really struggling with this series , twice now I've settled in to give it a chance but twice I've gone back to reruns of Seinfeld.
A few minor issues are putting me off , the continuity is just terrible with Bateman having a big bruise on his face one day and it's cleared up completely the next... so sloppy.
Then we have the basement tenant who's there for "god knows what". I think he's just been added because they need a quirky character and even this trait is trite and overplayed.
These minor issues pile on top of really flat acting by most of the crew, this tire needs some serious air to make the ride comfortable and there's not a single performance that helps.
Then we turn to the basis of the plot which is a paper thin idea to launder $6 million in an area where anyone spending ten bucks attracts attention.<br/><br/>Totally unconvincing , how they come up with the money for such a project is beyond me , I'd have tossed the script into the garbage after the first couple of chapters. The only redemption is the scenery and I would think even that appeal would fade if it was filmed in the bleak wintertime.
Can I get through the rest of it? I don't think so....Me no like! Watched season 1 and loved it then saw some bad reviews for season 2 and it's totally unjustified. Almost done with the second season now and I want it to last more. I don't know why this is being compared to breaking bad, It is a stand alone unique series that will keep you on the edge of your seat wanting to see next episode and hoping it will keep going and going and going. There are other shows that I really like on Netflix but this one is in a league of its own. It might just be me but I've always found that some of the shows Netflix puts out are lacking something. This show doesn't come off that way. It almost seems like you're watching a show that's on HBO which says a lot considering their history of hit TV shows. I just read a review . Came off like a retired , lonely and definitely retired cop . He is rusty if I am right because he doesn't believe good men can be killers . Wow !!! Anyone who thinks what they see on the news comprises all criminal activity is blind ! The types of crime that people get away with is the big stuff that involves and is supported through big money . Big money people , a percentage of them , any percentage is thought evoking use the criminal elements in society to do their dirty work. Get your head out of the devices and look at the world and the people in it . People do get in bed with organized crime and eventually it comes back to haunt them .<br/><br/>That being said in reply to haters putting down this show because they feel its far fetched . Get a grip ..... its a TV show. Do those people walk out of theaters when they take their young children because the animated characters do not have genitals too ? <br/><br/>Ozark is phenomenal and I hope it has a long run. Bateman is fascinating in this role which must be a blast to play . Being a well educated , extremely brave family man who doesn't carry a gun and can not fight but uses his cunning mind to extricate himself out of both physical harm from "the muscle" and to fend off law enforcement alike has to be the most fun role an actor can land . Bateman has chops for it and in spades. I love all the characters . OK , the pain in the ass teenager has really been beaten to death from The Americans , Breaking Bad , Ray Donovan , Homeland ,etc. and hopefully in the future the writers of this great genre which has turned into a golden age of television shows.<br/><br/>Lastly , to the miserable out ............... can't you just enjoy yourself . What you write disparagingly of is poetic license . Something obvious that isn't likely is usually a circumstance dictated by the logistics of film making . I mean , all these shows ( and I love almost all of them ....I can not get into Game of Thrones and Justified though ...... just an inexplicable dislike for them ) always have the car surveillance the subjects parked in front of the subjects house ! Lol ! It is things i.e. this that should not sour you to a show . Its Hollywood ....enjoy it !!!!!<br/><br/>I personally feel like I do when I find a parking spot right in front of my building during a blizzard when I chose to watch " Ozark " . I binged it right then and there in bed all night into morning . It is on my " Great Television " of this millennium along with ( in no order at all ) Breaking Bad ,<br/><br/>Ray Donovan , Homeland , Sneaky Pete , Kingdom , Animal Planet , Black list , Sopranos , Dexter ,House of Cards , etc.. I know I am leaving many out . <br/><br/>Lastly to the I,m sure , self titled Best TV critics out there . You may want to cool down mentioning your disdain for all the homosexuality ,that in your eyes ..... rears its ugly head in most every show . I would bet Lesbians are no problem for you , but" those queers being showed doing stuff " is disgusting and not necessary ..........I say "me thinks thou protests too much " : )<br/><br/>I'm straight but guys who can't stop telling everyone how much they can not stand gay men most likely are in the closet <br/><br/>Let us all write letters to all the great cable with their own programming to buy the show " Animal Kingdom " so that show can really entertain us !!! The show is incredibly exciting and interesting, if you enjoyed breaking bad you will enjoy this different take on the "normal dude with a double life" story. Instead of aiming towards the production and selling of drugs like breaking bad highlighted, this show highlights the side of illicit activities I find even more incredibly interesting. That could just be me but I think the financial aspect of drugs is something hardly any other show has done as well as Ozark. Seriously, if you even remotely liked breaking bad or the wire, this deserves a shot.<br/><br/>I was born in Missouri and lived there for the first 20 years of my life until this year when this series came out. I started watching it after only glancing at the description about drugs and money laundering, which allows for a pretty damn good series (Breaking Bad, The Wire, etc). What I did not expect was that it was actually going to take place in the Ozarks, a place I know well and have been to most summers growing up. I never thought I would see the day of such a fantastic series being filmed at that lake. One thing that literally hit home for me was the subtle references to places surrounding the Lake of the Ozarks (party cove comes to mind) and really the southern Missouri culture that people from the East or West coast probably think is odd or down right insane (like the abundance of guns, bottle rocket wars on the 4th, the Cards vs Cubs rivoraly). I've been living so far away for the past few months it was good to get a bit of that back in my mind. Laura Linney is exceptional. I've known this since seeing her in "You Can Count on Me" (2000). Her high caliber work here is no surprise. Jason Bateman, on the other hand, was a revelation. His strong performance is perfectly calibrated. Not only is Bateman excellent in "Ozark," he directs four of the episodes with a keen eye for setting, framing and actors.<br/><br/>As good as Linney and Bateman are, they don't have to carry the show. The cast is very talented and the writing impresses. Stereotyping is kept to a minimum and most of the characters are smart, exchanging realistic dialogue that keeps one engaged. The show avoids predictability while setting up tantalizing possibilities for future seasons. <br/><br/>I found the show riveting. The reviews were generally positive but tepid, so my expectations were somewhat low. What a pleasant surprise to find that "Ozark" is a top-notch drama. The acting, writing and direction are first-rate. Looking forward to several seasons of this excellent series. First of all, I want to state up front that I enjoyed this show very much. I went into it hoping for and expecting a solid crime thriller that put me at the mercy of the storytelling - as opposed to what you too often find nowadays where you can call what's about to happen ten steps ahead in every movie. It certainly delivered on that front, and when I wrapped up the final episode I was left wanting more.<br/><br/>Jason Bateman easily took center stage in every scene he was in (EXCEPT for the ones with Julia Garner in them), and the writers did a good job of fleshing out his methodic personality in the early stages of the show so as to not carry on the mental image everyone has of him being merely a comic. He came across very genuine, but I felt that by the end of the show his character was a little too stoic, without betraying any realistic vulnerability - I would attribute that to the writing. Laura Linney played the supportive wife very well, a little too well I would say. I feel as though her character was far too accepting of everything that goes on throughout the story, giving little to no resistance. The resistance was therefore put on the children's shoulders, which also came across as a tad in- genuine due to the fact that real kids wouldn't narrate the situation before expressing their opinion every time they open their mouths.<br/><br/>There were also a lot of characters to keep up with relative to the length of the season. A LOT. This isn't really something I'd expect in a crime thriller - you would want your viewers to be engrossed in every conflict rather than spending any time recalling who's who. I didn't mind it too much personally, but if you're someone that has trouble keeping track of a bunch of different characters, you'll probably feel that confusion here. There are a few instances of time delineation where you see the story unfold in a few different scenes but placed in non-chronological order. In many ways it made the backstory more enjoyable, but it also caused me to ponder the order in which they fit more than once.<br/><br/>I do want to get back around to what I loved about this show, however - I give it an 8/10 for a reason. Julia Garner (who plays Ruth Langmore) did such an amazing job playing the wild card of a character. I was always fully engrossed in her storyline and her face never betrayed any hint of what was to come. There were a bunch of different plot twists and turns that like I said, took me by surprise. I even found myself doubting whether the "untouchable" centerpiece characters would make it out alive.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I've got to compare it to the obvious; I would call this Breaking Bad-lite. If you're a fan of that show or shows like it, I'm sure you'll enjoy Ozark. The characters aren't nearly as memorable, but they're good. Jason Bateman isn't any Bryan Cranston, but then again, who is? Weak writers rely on profane language and nudity. No thank you It's like a show teenagers would perform for their drama class at school. Same level of acting too.<br/><br/>Too much goes on at once and always know what round the corner. Work with mafia people? and get in trouble because of that? This movie is being judged rather harshly, I feel. Yes, there are holes and parts of the story that could use more background and development, but name your favourite Hollywood blockbuster and they generally have more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings. I viewed it as a fairy tale and got pretty much what would be expected. I think the opening scene is breathtaking, the actors held my attention, as did the storyline. The acting was good within the constraints of the storyline. Not a movie you take a day off work to see, but not bad if you don't have something specific in mind. Ozark ranks right up there with the best of television dramas. The acting, the pace of action, the writing -- it excels all around This is gonna be a short and consist review. This is, hands down, one of the greatest show I've ever seen. Its so well written, incredible acting and very very suspense. This show has to go home with all the globes and awards this year. I really cant see who or what should top this. Im almost speechless.<br/><br/>As always, don't get your hopes up by my review, but seriously, this show. This show!! <br/><br/>Masterpiece!! Netflix does it again!<br/><br/>Finished season 1 in under 1 1/2, and already on episode 6 I was sad because I knew there was only one season.<br/><br/>Cast is more or less really good, and the main characters are doing a excellent job. I really enjoy seeing Bateman as a serious character. Tension is high, and you keep wanting more. Reminds me a little of Breaking Bad, without the comedy part though. I can only see this series as being the next big thing, and will be so disappointed if they don't make a season 2 fast!!! The critics said I'd love it, friends recommended it. I always give shows a good 3/4 episodes before giving up or being dedicated and there was glimmers of hope in episode 4, but episode 5 it's back to being very slow going? I'm yet to care about any of the characters or their intentions. And feel I could summarise what's happened in a few sentences. Sorry for me it should be OzZzzzzzark So multi-layered and encaptivating. If you find 99 per cent of shows on Netflix too immature, aimed at teenagers and unwatchable, Ozark will steal your heart. What a performance from all these actors! For me, every character is on point in this series. The Byrds, the Snells, the Langmores, the lawyer, the cop, the cartel... Well done! Is the only detail i can ,criticize , in Mexico is well known when a Cartel want to kill someone they kill it just like that ,
"they kill it a huevo" This is a great, great show. The one star reviews are baffling. Wow wow wow
all I can say is wow
outstanding acting from all the cast.
gives breaking bad a run for its money.
the best TV show I've seen in years.
give Jason bateman all the awards. top notch
a must watch
ten outta ten Jason Bateman has exceeded himself with this and taken something that is so basic and raw into the best series I've ever seen. You do nos rest for five minutes in this series, there something else waiting down the corner, but it's perfectly written and the characters of the story are great. It's so impredidictable that you would want to see 3 episodes on the row and still leaving you wanting for more. Bateman holds everything together! I loved the first season. however, the second season really take the show up a few notches. characters develop and grow into their own. story is great. actors gives performances that would def be deserving of award nominations.
this just might be the best second season of a show i've seen in a long time. I wanted to say the show is in my top 3 all time favorite TV shows...Game Of Thrones and Breaking Bad being the other two. Then I thought surely there are other shows so I maybe it's in my top five. Then I thought I can confidently say it's in my top 10. Acting is superb...the actor who plays "Ruth"...wow! Directing, writing...all of it is wonderful. To those saying it's not realistic...you all must hate all sci-fi movies. So, still trying to decide the other TV shows in my top 10 list. I have just finished watching series 2, having been an avid follower of series 1; this is the best drama Ive seen in a long time and every bit as good as Breaking Bad. Jason Bateman, Laura Linney and all the cast give sterling performances, and the storyline/plot is incredibly intelligent with more twists and turns than the alpha helix. I especially love the deadpan way Jason Bateman delivers his response to catastrophic events - fantastic! Amazing performances from everyone, pacing is on point, barely a dull moment. The best American crime series of 2017-18 that is so dark that it will never be as popular as it deserves.<br/><br/>The acting is, from the tip to the bottom, phenomenal. Like Skylar Gaertnar had me in tears with his funeral euology and I never cry at TV series. NEVER. It is Jason Bateman's peak performance. I don't think I've ever hated a law enforcement agent as much as I've hated Jason Harner. Laura Linney as Wendy Byrd did what the formidable Anna Gunn could never quite do for Skyler White. Makes you love her as she lies and cheats and becomes a hypocrite for her family. Oh and Julia Garner as Ruth does that too. Just twice over. <br/><br/>Which needs its own paragraph. Julia Garner has made what is quite possibly the most endearing performance of criminal "trailer trash" America since... Well ever in my opinion, though some might say Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman in 'Breaking Bad' trumps it. <br/><br/>I do not.<br/><br/>And the 2nd series is even better. This show is great! I love Bateman in most of his work and in this he's incredible. Ruth is such a great character. I got into the show a night ago and now I've finished both seasons. So sad I finished and I want more. Definitely recommend for anyone in search of a new thriller. The closest other similar show is Breaking Bad. Ozarak has interesting characters, good writing, good directing, some great acting (two female leads especially). But what limits this show from summiting the heights of really great shows - like Sopranos - is that the writting is just not entirely realistic, not fully believable.Don't get me wrong - the show is quite watchable! Jason Bateman and the family are in all the episodes. Watched the whole 10 series 2 in two days. Well after rating the first series a 9, this series scores a solid 10. Exceeded my expections by far Jason Bateman is always captivating and love his personality that he applies to his roles. This show doesn't have a lot of good guys. There's a few moments that will amaze you but overall I think it flies in slightly below the mark mark of amazing. I am excited to see the second season . This show is great. I couldn't stop watching after episode 1. The twist & turns that each episode takes kept me glued to the tv. There's some jaw dropping and humorous moments throughout season one. I'm so glad that Netflix is bringing this back for a second season on July 1st! I can't wait to see what's going to happens next! Excellent show... Great cast and great acting- I'm so excited for Season 2!!! It's not easy to find a drama that has humor.. just add Jason Bateman and you'll get home run every time! It's one the best shows of all time and definitely of 2017. Emotional, tense, dramatic and above all a wonderful story line. <br/><br/>Marty Byrde convinces the cartel that he can launder their money from a remote city called Ozark. What he doesn't know yet is, how? <br/><br/>Brilliant with numbers, Marty starts on a new venture to protect himself and his family and along the way he meets with up different people with their own agendas. <br/><br/>The characterization for the entire series is wonderful. All the characters have been written clearly and no one them change their behaviour during the time of the series. For me that's the key part. We don't want someone to suddenly turn into heroes or villain for no reason. There are no such rapid turn of events in this series.<br/><br/>The series slowly builds itself like an opera. The start of which is soft and slow and the pace builds up evenly. The music is wonderful. In the last episode, which involves the priest, the piano is timed in an exquisite way.<br/><br/>What about the actors? They are brilliant. Jason Bateman as Mr Byrde is just brilliant. He just doesn't get ruffled by or show any emotion during high stress situation. He eases into the character and engages the audience to take a ride into the life of Marty Byrde.<br/><br/>Laura Linney is amazing as a wife who is sure and not sure about being with Marty. What she does with her life is for you to see during the series but she does a wonderful job as a wife who is pissed of at her husband and yet want to support him in his endeavor. <br/><br/>The cartel, landlord, neighbors, FBI and everyone else does an amazing job. It does say how much they have scrutinized to select people to play these characters. Hats off to the casting team. <br/><br/>Can't wait for Season 2. This series is a classic on many levels. First and foremost, Jason Bateman shows the true and complex talents at his disposal. He has shown strong hints of these talents with AD and yet this series and his acting, writing, and producing talents shine and it's about time. Second, the premise is both unrealistic and yet gripping and interesting. The cinematography is dark, moody, and dark again. the acting is first rate. For those wanting fully explained premises, this and vibe saturated series like Better Call Saul and Breaking Bad are not for you. The criticism that the premise is unrealistic and characters too often talk/find their way out of situations too easily may be true but the absolute same can be said of BCS and BB. The characters are worth getting to know (some from a far distance). 
Over all this is a winner and is easily up there with other instant classics like Better Call Saul and Breaking Bad. Highly recommend this. I enjoy the tension, the clash of cultures and the portraits of dysfunctional families. At times, the show is a bit too clever for its own good, but it is fun to watch the twists and turns in each episode. Plenty of irony to go around. The acting is excellent and I enjoy seeing Harris Yulin, Peter Mullan and Jordana Spiro give outstanding performances in their supporting roles.<br/><br/>This show is definitely dark and violent, not warm and fuzzy-so it is not for everyone. Still, I think the story line and the interactions of diverse characters are compelling enough to make this series a winner and I hope it gets a few more seasons on Netflix. We are thrown out of comfort zone with the Byrde family right from the beginning and each episode is just amazing! All the characters are interesting and different and its just a thrilling journey.<br/><br/>People who gave it a low rating because they thought its going to be another breaking bad, what were you thinking? Cant wait for season 2! So, the problem I have with this show is that there are too many moments where I shook my head and felt there is no way this could ever happen. Maybe I like shows to be as close to reality as possible, perhaps I am more aware of how people would really act under all of the circumstances that occur in this series. Whatever the reason is, I could not believe most of what happens in Ozark. The acting of Julia Garner was good but her lines were unrealistic and she did the best she could. I have always loved Jason Bateman (should stay with comedy) and Laura Linney ( lost her way due to script). <br/><br/>However, I think most people leave very dull lives and will accept whatever is given to them in order to escape so this show might live on. Some minor spoilers below.<br/><br/>This has been my latest binge and we made ourselves stagger it, no more than two episodes per day. It wasn't easy but any more than that and I think I would chuck it all in to launder money, even if it's only my own.<br/><br/>It's a bit gory and definitely nerve wracking, watching the poor characters cope with problem after problem thrown at them, but watching Marty (Bateman) problem-solve is a thing of beauty. It's dark, it's a bit gritty and it will make you feel uncomfortable more than a few times. Honestly, I only started watching this show because Jason Bateman was in it and I generally like shows that he is in. And once again he didn't disappoint. <br/><br/>I highly suggest this show if you enjoy dark dramas that will keep you on the edge of your seat and maybe second guessing a possible life of crime. The writing for this series and the acting of Jason Bateman and Laura Linney make this a pleasure to watch. I hope they continue with the series and that they can maintain the quality. I do have one gripe: please get a dialect coach for the people playing the Ozark natives. Awful! The guy playing the local drug kingpin may have the worst accent ever. There is no area of this United States where people talk like this person. I am so tired of hearing regional accents getting butchered. The conceit of the actor to think that he or she can just make something up and wing it is overwhelming. I would much rather hear them just speak normally. I am halfway through the series after binge watching 7 episodes last night. I have to confess that I am a little biased as they film the show about 10 minutes from my house and it makes it more interesting to watch as it's fun to see locations that I know personally. But, the show is very good. I have heard of many comparisons to Breaking Bad and honestly I think that show was way overrated. Although I watched every Bresking Bad show after the first 3 seasons I only watched half interested and because I had already invested a lot of time and I just wanted to see how it would end. Bateman has done a good job here and I've always thought he was a bit underrated. Laura Linney is always good and the supporting cast is stellar. The premise is somewhat implausible, but anything interesting always will be a little over the top. My only complaint with shows like these is they always seem to come up with way over the top story lines as a time filler. It's like the writers just ask themselves "what crazy scenario could I could up with to eat up 30 mins of screen time". We were just introduced to the "hillbilly" as a new character and I can see that this guy is going to get annoying. These shows always bring out new characters to start new story lines, but how about trying to explore and expand on the characters we already have? But, overall it's a fun show with interesting characters and I hope we get a 2nd season! Not advertised well I binge watched this during lockdown. I can't wait for a new series. Finished the others too fast. I mean sure it's very unrealistic for this type of drama but great cast and if only advertised better would he the best out. Concept and Story 3/3
Sounds and Music quality 3/3
Acting and Effects 3/3
Reviewer 1+= no
Final rating = 10/9 Three Seasons in and just like wine, getting better with age. If Breaking Bad is an icon and celebrated as one of the best Brutal stories of all time, I will suggest Ozark should appear on the podium.
Well thought out plot lines and threads, extremely complex characters and acting where not one of the ensemble fails to deliver.
Jason Bateman, it's been a long way from "Teen Wolf".
Two more words...Just Brilliance... Season 1: 9/10
Season 2: 8/10
Season 3: 6/10
Really enjoyed the first season, as well as the second. Both were smartly written and captivating. The third season for the most part was utterly ridiculous and found myself constantly thinking how most of it made little to no sense. Good acting all the way through.
Had potential to be great if the 3rd season wasn't such a let down. Ozark is one of the best thrillers in TV with exceptional performances from Bateman, Linney, Julia Garner and others. I didn't see a lot of mention about the dark intense music that plays in the background that kinda gives you the chills. One of the best from Netflix. Highly recommend I can't wait for season 4 please make it soon and the third season is going very twisted thought This show feels so real, I am amazed by the unfolding of the events and development of the characters. I stood by them and felt pain, joy, fright, relief. It's like I lived a whole second life. Couldn't stop watching one episode after the next. Marty is my hero I have never seen a web-series that has 3 seasons. But I watched all three seasons of Ozark. Ozark is so full of mystery that I did not even know the time when I was watching this. Ozark is my favorite web-series I have ever seen. Must Watch. I gave it a 10/10 after watching season 1+2 back to back a while back.<br/><br/>I've been busy but this week I randomly saw season 3 came out. Checked it out to see if it was anything like I remembered.<br/><br/>Well what I think is.... I can't remember a series of this structure, pace and level of acting before. And writing. I won't say it is perfect but I will say it is really well done in many aspects. And beyond the entertainment of thinking what might happen to the people in the stories, it actually made me think about things of my own. But not in a preachy way or some obvious way. I do not usually stand up for the people who do wrong, but this is so brilliantly written you can't help but root for the Byrde family.
One of the best series ever. Season Three is the best season so far! Watched it in a matter of two days. Love it!!! Geeze-laweeze they are violent in the Ozarks. And not just criminals, but evidently most everybody. Doesn't someone notice the rate of family members killing each other? Killing uncles, killing spouses, killing parents (not to mention the neighbors that go missing).<br/><br/>OK , I get it, there is some attempt to embody some of the groundbreaking take of The Sopranos on family life in a crime family. But this doesn't have the irony or interesting character psychology of The Sopranos. Tony Soprano was an interesting character, not because of his situation, but because of his personality. Ozarks attempts at complex interesting characters are too contrived and superficial. They even have scenes with a therapist (imitating Sopranos) that are just silly.<br/><br/>And the plot turns are pretty much - speak out loud about the cartel, that person dies. The 3rd season pretty much jumps the shark over and over. And the conversations with the all powerful, deep-voiced drug kingpin Navarro border on comical.<br/><br/>But with all that, it is very entertaining, mostly because of the actors. So will continue to watch for the fun of it. I am on season 2episode 8, they killed innocent priest..it's so depressing all. Best crime thriller, abt criminals psychology !!!!üëçüëç There's a bit of overreaching here with some chance occurrences and coincidences that seem far fetched. The series follows a similar anti hero tale to breaking bad that works well - worth a watch and binge! I don't know, I enjoy watching Breaking Bad or Better Call Saul, but this show is too much dark (colors) and too much stretched without much of things to learn from that. Nothing much unique or extra ordinary here, watchable, but not that enjoyable and not a must watch. This series is beautiful. Fantastic acting with a twisting turning story line, and a real sense of jeopardy. Intertwined with the normality of family life. Yet nothing is normal from day to day. It's just so good and the paradoxical nature of their situation is just so dark and entertaining. The scenery is fantastically drab, while the characters are full of depth and colour. A total total triumph in my opinion. Thank you for making it. Marty & Wendy allows Charlotte to talk to them any kind of way and they react like total pricks! They never put their foot down! Marty seem so hell-bent on doing things to save the family from being killed YET he put his trust into EVERYONE! Why leave a safe full of money knowing you can't trust anyone! Why would he keep giving Ruth big bags of cash KNOWING she lives in a freaking TRAILER! His character is STUPID & NAIVE! Charlotte needs to drown immediately, Wendy needs to start talking up for herself and not put her head down when Charlotte decides to have a btch fit! As parents you do not have to disclose every little detail of your personal life! I hated when Wendy & Marty would go off and have a PRIVATE conversation, Charlotte would immediately ask "What were you and das talking about?! Like STFU it's not your business!!!!! Stay in a child's place!
Uggggg, That was my only issues with the show. Other than that it's binge worthy & kept me glued 2 seasons straight! Can't wait for season 3. Unespectable great tv show from the first episode. Watch it and you eill be surprised. I have read most of the reviews and for those who reviewed this show badly, I have to say, did we watch the same show? I have just finished Season 1 and Season 2 and can not wait for Season 3. This is great TV and certainly a highly recommended series to watch. Its very unpredictable, lots of tension, great cast, great story, never a dull moment. I watched this series because I like Jason Bateman. He is a very believable actor whether in a comedy or drama. I only watch TV series that has something interesting to make me keep watching every single episode of the season otherwise I would stop and lose interest. There is definitely something here in each and every episode. Having watched the main character Marty, I don't know why he has not had a heart attack yet as he gets in extremely stressful situations in any and every way he turns. Great show! Bring on Season 3! It's really dramatic, in a good way. And awesome actors. Great show. Some fantastic acting. Pacing is a little slow but not boring. Keeps you locked in with an engaging storyline.<br/><br/>Only issue... the ENTIRE show is filmed with the lights off! It's so dark... you're basically just listening to this whole show. Well, it's what I said above.It's very dark - story and filming - but has it's funny moments. All the characters are beautfully written, there are layers to them, the different sides of the personalities are shown.Very good cast, but Julia Garner stands out - what a performance!!!!! - incredible work - and she wasn't even nominated for an Emmy, I think. That's a shame, because she deserves every price that's there. The twists and turns of the story aren't too unlikely, you can see a lot coming, but it's brilliant how it's executed. Don't let the first episode put you off. It's the worst episode (from series 1 + 2). See Bateman in a new light, fantastic show that had me hooked from the beginning. The plot is very very very slow and just makes it annoying. Nothing great happening in series just left it halfway Netflix just did it again. One of the businesses that I'm willing to give my money because they make exemplary contents.<br/><br/>People say It's like Breaking Bad. But it is far from it. Breaking bad is totally different and they stalled the show way too long probably to make profit. <br/><br/>Ozark has so many intricacies that you wouldn't have even expected just like game of thrones. Some of the scenes made me even laugh because it was kinda true and ridiculous at the same time. I just can't stress enough how this show is so awesome because I'm not good with playing words. But surely this show is so great I would want to see the next season asap. Good acting, production etc, etc...but it's really boring. I struggle to get through a episode. I normally binge watch series with no issue but this is a really hard watch for me. I never really liked Jason Bateman in other stuff but he really has found his home here. Comparisons to Breaking Bad are inevitable but no way is it a rip off. Superb cast all round that you can get invested in and root for with twists and turns galore. What more could you want from a series? Watch it, you'll only wonder what took you so long.... One of the best series you'll find on any platform. Grabs your attention until the end of the next episode and keeps it until the next one. Excellent cast, directing, dialogue, story, cinematography and so on. This is more of an overview of what to expect, than any spoilers or specifics.<br/><br/>Ozark is an incredible blend of the comic short speech that has made Jason Bateman so amusing and fun to watch in Arrested Development, and his other work, including one of my own favorites, Extract; with a more seriously violent constant pressured plot, similar to Breaking Bad. I like the blend, and most of the situations play out realistically, even though convenient solutions do come quite often. Bateman's humor, while very good in timing, makes me wonder if it is sustainable in such a serious tone for longer. Quips and sarcasm play out in serious situations, but this show is more likely to cause a mental breakdown in a character than be worth laughing over. But hey- so far, so good. <br/><br/>Season 1 brought a family into a situation they never even knew they were in do to bad business dealings by partners and others involved in a larger bogus "financial business". The moral of Season 1 is really more about why you don't do illegitimate business dealings or wash money in the first place, no matter how clean you see your part as being. By the end of the season an acceptance that they must adapt to survive has set in, as other abnormal situations, deaths, and circumstances cause a pile of issues that no one family could probably handle.<br/><br/>Season 2 lifts off very closely after, which also makes you wonder if such a short window is sustainable in time frame from one season to the next (a few months). The wheels are still turning on several situations from the first season, and this show does have a very intricate way of layering in pieces to use for convenient solutions or endings later on. There are some very relate-able characters, good and bad in their intentions who all pretty much serve the purpose you would imagine at first glance. The interesting intrigue about this show isn't about predictability, though; rather, the pressure being constant like Khabib pressing an opponent to the ground over and over until submission sets in. This show keeps you in awe of just how resilient Marty and his family are. It is a family in a room where the walls are closing in- and they keep figuring out ways to push them out inch by inch.<br/><br/>Is it sustainable? Maybe, or maybe not. Just enjoy it while it lasts. This has been enjoyable and exciting. This is a story line that I watched and wanted to see more. It is clean enough to be appetizing to the public, and just dirty enough to make you feel that it is real. The actors are fantastic and everything is so realistic that it could be a newspaper headliner for today. I do hope the creators keep it running for many season to come. This show is great for those who like a well-developed plot with lots of twists. There is a nice mixture of what you would expect and things you just don't see coming. There is some religious profanity that I hope will be excluded moving forward. I refuse to give any spoilers but, lets just say, it gets crazy. Absolutely, there has not been a program this riveting since, "Breaking Bad." Twists and turns with every episode, great writing, acting, and direction! Undoubtedly, this series was inspired by some of TV's recent hit-shows. It combines the "average, boring dude makes a wrong decision and all goes downhill from there" theme of Breaking Bad with the surreal and at times downright hilarious cynicism and satire of Fargo. Yet at the same time it seems much darker and more tense than these two - some of the scenes positively reminded me of Rectify, with its gut-wrenching dialogs and character-driven scenes that are sometimes almost unbearable to watch because they're so intense and convincing. <br/><br/>The acting is superb, the story is in some way fast-paced but gives the complex characters enough time to breathe and develop, and the constant surprises and twists never cease to amaze. This is amazing television and easily one of the best shows in recent years. I'm getting ready to watch this on Neflix and I looked it up here to see where it was filmed at. Georgia??? And "Lake Ozark" Missouri... I always heard is as "Lake of the Ozarks" having lived in the Ozarks all my life. I didn't know that the Ozarks extended all the way over to Georgia. This has become more the common place in TV and movies than the sometimes use. Writers wake up, the shock of F--- wore off years ago. Ruth and now everybody except Jonah are using the word to death. It seems Wendy is trying to out do Ruth. This is a good show and could be much better if the writers would clean up the language.My 5 stars is mainly because of the language. Let's see: Mommy has some side action. Cuck daddy is thinking about side action. Sofia Hublitz who IRL just turned 18 plays the rebellious, hot daughter who likes the skimpy shorts. The pilot gave my BP a rise.<br/><br/>Bateman is very convincing and methodical as a financial adviser turned money launderer. He's the glue that might hold this series together. He's cleaning the cartel cash for Del played perfectly by Esai Morales. He's so powerful and brutal, yet soft-spoken and cagey. I'm disappointed that he's only listed for 4 of the 10 episodes.<br/><br/>I'll stay on for Episode 2 to see how Bateman's family sets up on the Lake of the Ozarks. The pace needs to remain at high speed with intrigue, danger...and sex. I really enjoy the show, but by the final few episodes of season 3 uncle Bens "episodes" were way way over the top and nothing short of annoying. WAY too much time was wasted on him this 3rd season. I am extremely happy season 4 will be different ;)<br/><br/>Also, several, actually most, of the key characters conveniently started making way out of "character" decisions nearing the end of the season, which I found lame (in terms of the writing department). For so many to change so abruptly within an episode or three, like complete opposites, nah its just too unrealistic for me. Ya know, this series doesn't always need to have "dumb" characters taking up the majority of spotlight for a season... seriously, the subject matter calls for more "serious" roles and dialogue (or at least more realistic). IMVHO this approach would make the show stronger and take it to a new level.<br/><br/>While season 3 was enjoyable, it wasn't without serious flaws, therefor, my previous rating of 9 has been changed to and 8. I certainly hope next season will be a 10, not a 7. The series is a first class production but not as enjoyable as it could or should be. It lacks any characters that you really like or root for. Real life is more grey than black and white but when a character is in jeopardy you might think the scene is interesting but you won't have any personal or emotional investment in the outcome. Still the series is both well acted and well done. I love Bateman as an actor. Seeing him in not a comedy play, but rather in these dark series, is for me a dream come true. I have seen the first three episodes just after eachother. Most of the times I love the writing. The acting is good. But for the three seasons I guess I have seen it. The Byrde's are working for the Mexican mobs and that will never change. That's where my problem is, and I will explain it.<br/><br/>Season three was the cherry on the pie. Yes the hard core, Bateman, Linny and Garner act like they are dead serious getting Ozark to get nominated for awards. But what Tom Pelphrey pulled off was insane. Playing this bipolar brother of Wendy, he just killed it. It's a shame Ozark is not very popular in The Netherlands, seeing Pelphrey's phenomenal performance just lying under the snow. I have seen many mediocre actors and actresses during the episodes, and many of them died. In that line it's (unfortunately) not difficult to say that Charlotte and Jonah will be in this series while it lasts. Thay don't add much to the series. They don't spice up the food. Pelphrey did. After his character getting killed, Wendy asked the same questions, like I guess the writer also did. How could she have let him live on? He was a loose cannon. Him getting killed was the most easy way. For that the writer looses my credits. A writer should never go for the easy way.<br/><br/>Episode 9 of season 3 was the best I have seen of these series. Hoping Ben would survive. The music, edditing, acting, it was a 10/10. Ending the season with clown gangster rap, while there are no afro Americans in Ozark running the business, was misplaced. There was a chance of getting more meaning to the role of Jonah, but like his father he did not have the guts.<br/><br/>It is obvious that Navarro is an actor, giving these episodes, or the lives of the people playing in it, meaning to keep going on in these series. But most of the time Navarro is nog in the picture. The focus should be on Ozark and the Ozark community, of which the Byrde's became a part of. Skip the kartel, focus on the Byrdes, Langmores, Snells, Wilkes and Cosgroves. And please, when you put in very great actors and actresses, don't get them killed. They are hard to come by. Pelphrey was to Ozark, what Jharrel Jerome was to When They See Us; pearls in a pool of actors. Good luck on the sequel to a good series, I enjoy the screen of the rebound TV. Ozark is really about "Feminine Empowerment". 
Notice that all the important decisions are made by the gals: Charlotte, Darlene, Hellen, Rachel, Ruth and Wendy. 
The men, just sort of go along. 
In fact, one: Jacob, was poisoned by wife Darlene, before he could kill her. Darlene also shot the Mexican Boss, Dell, in the face...! 
Think about it...! Such a good show. I would recommend it to any one (of age). Bateman does such a stellar job, I knew after The Gift he could nail a suspenseful role, but he takes the cake in The Ozark. He is really flexing his acting chops. <br/><br/>The plot keeps moving, the characters are interesting, and it's just plain fun. It makes me nostalgic for the Breaking Bad days. I was missing a show like this in my life. <br/><br/>I hope it continues for years to come there's so much story that can be told and so far season 2 is better than the first. I love how this is shot and the plot is constantly surprising you and going in dark directions you don't expect. Jason bateman was made for his role too, it's a perfect fit. I truly don't think anyone else could pull off his character. Ozark is such an amazing show with an intense plot, incredible audio, and deep character development to keep you watching and wanting more. Almost every episode ends in with a heightened, energetic scenario-the plot is not easily predictable. There are some points where Ozark completely goes off the tracks and catches you off guard, and it is this aspect that I love so much about the show. The audio cues are tied in so well with these specific moments, as well, which only helps intensify them. The Byrd family slowly begins to develop through each of the twists and turns and seeing them, especially the kids, learn to cope with this new life that they have just been thrown into. Seeing how they react to each of the decisions thrown at them and the consequences following each of the decisions is something that I personally find very intriguing. <br/><br/>I have read three other reviews all from different sources on Ozark and all three talked negatively about the show. I found that all three, however, kept trying to compare it to Breaking Bad (which, don't get me wrong, I can definitely see some of the similarities), but I feel like those critics and reviewers need to realize this is a new take on a similar idea. You'll notice a lot of reviewers comparing Ozark to Breaking Bad. No one told us to do that, it's just kind of obvious that this project is a vehicle for Jason Bateman and Laura Linney to stretch their wings a bit. If the producers didn't want people to draw those parallels, but most of us did anyway, then that's bad writing. If they did want us to draw parallels, then it's "reductive," as Madonna would say, and bad writing. Subtract 2 stars. <br/><br/>Jason Bateman's performance -- it's hard to go against typecasting, and he pulls it off sufficiently. He couldn't break the mold like Bryan Cranston, or incorporate it into his character like Bob Odenkirk, because the writing in Ozark isn't as nimble as it was in Breaking Bad. Sigh. You're only as good as your writers... So, nice going, Mr. Bateman. You got the job done. No stars subtracted. <br/><br/>Laura Linney... oy. You'd think with a performance as brittle as hers, she would be close to breaking out of the mold, but...nnnnyyyaaaghhhnnnno. No matter what scene she's in, I just kept thinking, "That's Laura Linney doing her Laura Linney thing." Smile condescendingly and show us your dimples, Laura. Minus 1 point. Good girl. <br/><br/>Jason Bateman. Episode 9. Two men in a canoe on a lake. You directed this scene with the camera 3 feet offside the boat. Did the canoe run aground? Is the audience walking on water? Maybe the camera is transparent and stealthy like Wonder Woman's airplane? Not hardly. The camera needed to be in the boat with the actors, or on the shore, or at a bird's eye view. Minus 1 point for suspending my suspension of disbelief worse than an episode of Gilligan's Isle. <br/><br/>I know, I know, I can't take a point off for every shortcut. But as the man says in the first episode, it wasn't her first time stealing, it was just the first time you caught her at it. I can safely assume there were more. So even though I only watched the first episode, and then skipped to 9 & 10, I can make inferences. Besides, skipping ahead removes the context, so the acting should come to the fore. Should. In theory. But Ozark dropped the scientific method mic and boom! falsified my hypothesis entirely. So I skipped to the last 15 minutes because I remembered I had some laundry to lint roll. Ending your cliffhanger episode with 10 minutes of gentle background classical music? Minus 1 point for blatant troping. I've never been much of a Bateman fan, but I gotta say this series is brilliant. I have a new respect for the man. The performances by Bateman and Linney in particular are compelling, but the whole cast is awesome. Great story line, complex characters and great acting. Can't wait for more! Just got done watching the 1st season. Totally enjoyed the show. Ignore the negative reviews. It was a hell of a lot better, than half the garbage shows, that Netflix puts out these days. This show has a lot of potential. I hope Netflix doesn't cancel this show. Which seems the norm for them, these days. Amazing plot and storytelling without all the unnecessary BS family drama Breaking Bad had. Not any spouse or kid constantly moaning about the illegal activities going on.
The show is both thrilling and intense.
<ul><li>It's definitely a top tier show within it's genre.</li></ul> I've been a fan of this show since day one and believe me when i tell ya I have watched a lot of Netflix shows this is greatest one of every single one of them don't miss out This is worse ever watched episode .. gloomy shooting, boring actresses, unrealistic drama, full of negative energy, great for negative people, I am in SE1 Ep 5 the level of negativity is unmatched ... the story does not pull you enough to continue watching, dark shooting makes you feel tired and unwell, I am sure neither the director nor the production company Netflix has the experience to do something proper .. gay FBI , I don't know what production crew team wants you see but this is worse ever watched...this episode is good for twisted minds people ...I am done with it. Why do scriptwriters seem to think that using the 'f' word in every line, every sentence, sometimes more than once, sometimes many more times than once, very loudly, by everybody including minors, why do they think it makes good viewing?<br/><br/>The use of extremely bad language at a rate that would make a London docker blush, cloaks in shame what might have been a good story had the writers allowed the story to flow. It's unnatural, it's embarrassing, it's inflammatory.<br/><br/>But, unfortunately, it is also what hallmarks an American movie nowadays. The audience only loves fierce people to fight, and will actively reject any supporting role with normal views, just like they often avoid the successive setbacks in life, choose to escape the unpleasant people or things, and refuse to face them And that's how you end a season incredibly good.not like that rubbish end of game of Thrones It's a great show I highly recommend it, it is very suspenseful and has great emotional moments too. I am not usually one to enjoy a dark, gritty, crime-based drama. Any show where the color scale is permanently dimmed, or shaded blue, tends to be a bit heavy-handed for me. But Ozark pulled me in from the start. Bill Dubuque (director) grew up in the area where the show takes place, so his representation of the setting and ambiance is from personal experience. The acting is incredible (I would expect nothing less from Jason Bateman) and the pacing is appropriately slow. Each character seems so precise and specifically logical according to personal conviction. The inhabitants of the area are classic backcountry people, but the clear sense of individual moral compass and the heightened stakes raise the base behavior to a more intentional level. In the beginning, the Byrds are just an unfortunate family, caught up in money laundering as a result of Marty's seedy company. But things snowball at such a delicious rate, and the growth of their high risk/high reward activities moves so fast they couldn't stop it if they tried. The web of lies and betrayal could so easily become hard to follow and muddle the impact of the emotional moments but manages to stay legible and easy to follow. The arc with Pastor Mason and his family really touched me. The absolute injustice of his fate was a spot of morality among a sea of people striving only for their own success and financial gain. I've seen Breaking Bad, Sopranos etc etc so feel I know quality.
This is brilliant from start to so far!
None stop cliff hangers, great script and fabulous cast.
Well thought out, and brutally realistic. I got sucked in from the first episode and couldn't stop watching. It's a smarter, updated, more versatile, Breaking Bad. Everything seems plausible and possible. The acting isn't overdramatized, but cool and collected, which just makes it seem like you're getting a birds eye view of a real crime family. I believe everything that's happening and I don't want it to end. This show so rarely introduces characters that aren't interesting it's miraculous. Even characters that are highly unlikeable are still interesting. The cinematography definitely deserves a note as well, with scenes sometimes slipping in where you least expect them and making you feel like you're watching something from an entirely different genre. Beyond that, the show takes chances. Shock value comes when you least expect it. Can't wait to see what they do next. I completed watching this series a day ago, while the story is Good, the performances of the lead cast is highly disappointing...for the people who like fast paced storytelling like me, this is not the right series...with a very slowly moving storyline and many details being ignored...In my opinion the best performances came from Skylar Gaertner (Jonah) and Julia Garner (Ruth).. Season 1 could likely be the greatest TV series of all time. Jason Bateman is a genius and highly underrated artist. Well cast, well performed, well directed, and terrific music. Bravo! The first season was great, but season 2 gets even better. Each character fights for your support with their own battle, and the Byrds are slap bang in the middle of it all trying to work through the mess that inevitably comes when so many people are involved. I was told that I should give this show a look and believe me I am so glad I did. I find Ozark very entertaining and very much on par with some of the top rated shows in this category. I am so looking forward to season 3 and if the previous seasons are any indication , it should be great!! Ozark is a perefect netflix serie like others. Season 2 is much better than season 1 & i love it Literally one of the best shows I've ever watched. I felt empty when season two came to an end. The characters are amazing, the scenery is amazing, and the storyline is AMAZING!!!! I love everything about this show. Unpredictable and unique. Makes you think about partnering with a druglord. It's very realistic and makes you wonder... do people actually do this? People/companies who are professional or corporate? Is this something I could pursue? Lol! Was put off first by the title as I didn't know what or where this was....unless you live in USA or know geography pretty well, then in the UK, I doubt not many would know. Not to say I am not learned or ignorant as I have travelled!!
Anyway...watched first episode as I was curious and OMG, it is certainly worth watching. I love it, the story line is gripping and the acting is superb. Ruth Lamgmore is outstanding, love her accent and she brings a great strength to the show. Wendy and Marty are also such refined actors that they are great in their own right. I watched both season 1 and 2 back to backing less than one week at home when I was off work chillaxing! Can't wait for season 3... WELL DONE!!! I felt in love with tho show since the first episode of the 1st season. The idea was clever and tense. It really attracts you action after another. What I disliked about the show is how they decided to give it all up in the last episode of the 2nd season. I felt that there were too much to handle for one episode compared to other episodes of the same show. Good show, but there are some slow spots and fake scenes (which I really dislike), such as the poppy field after being burned down, and the baby being cut from her mother's womb (why didn't the lady take the baby then, also, especially if she wanted one so bad? It just doesn't make sense).<br/><br/>Also, I kept getting characters confused because they looked so much alike (namely the FBI agent with the pastor, since they looked similar).<br/><br/>The character of Ruth is very entertaining and unique, especially in the newer seasons. I can't think of any scenes she was in that were boring. Netflixs has done it again with a top tier drama. We have just finished watching season 1 of Ozark and I have to say it was every bit as good as GOTs. Excellent acting and charactor development, great writing and directing. If you are looking for crime drama that is engaging, easy to follow, and with a whole lot of surprises and action, this is that show. Can't wait to see the second season. I actually stopped watching this during the first episode. Then I decided to give it another shota couple months later. By the 2nd episode, I was hooked. I hate waiting. I WANT MORE!!! Nice job to all on this one... Finish 2 seasons in two weeks. Waiting for next season Truly one of Netflix's heavy hitters and a testament to how far that company has come. Bateman is a beast, even though I always expect people to call him Michael. Garner really rocks too-such a tragic character and so beautifully written and acted. Overally great characters. Story is good but reminds us all of another not-to-be-named show. However, it is taking steps to become its own thing, and has done a great job defining itself. Definitely worth a watch! Breaking Bad finally has its competition! Not that this could ever be better than Breaking Bad, but it's similar in nature and has the potential to be just as great!<br/><br/>Season 1 was great, Season 2 was even better! Now i can't wait to see how season 3 plays out! Just like Breaking Bad, the tension continues to build from season to season. This show is phenomenal and is here to stay. It's interesting to see how one choice leads to another and it's effect. We each have a choice and often times people think going dirty is easier. When this shows how hard it is to cheat, steal, and maintain yourself. This show is very good & tense with interesting plot. All the actors are doing super job with acting, especially main character. If you like crime-thrillers this is definitely to check. Fantastic thriller with breathtaking performances and some great plot twists. I am not a big fan of surprises, and I don't like to be frightened by TV or movies. However, I cannot stop watching Ozark! Although the seasons are short with only 10 episodes each, each one is full of tenuous anticipation. I know I am afraid, but not sure for whom. Jason Bateman and Laura Linney are outstanding in their roles, always playing close to the vest, yet turbulent just beneath the surface.<br/><br/>Marty is breaking the law and he knows it, but he still manages to do good things and works to hurt as few people as possible. I am always rooting for him and his family.<br/><br/>Can't wait for next season already. Episode 10 of Season 2 left me on the edge of my seat. I was shocked that Ozark, easily the best show set or dealing with rural Americana since Rectify, wasn't rated in the low 90s. This show is highly underrated and that's a real shame. I read many of the negative reviews and some from legendary critics I respect (such as Yahoo!'s Ken Tucker) who IMO really miffed this one.
The best way to go into Ozark is with zero background and no expectations.
I think the worst way to go into Ozark is by comparing it to heavy hitters like breaking bad or weeds. The latter, Weeds no disrespect to Qween Jenji) hit less emotional beats in their last 3 seasons than Ozark does in just 3 episodes. It's laughable how many tv critics repeat the "this show is the new breaking bad" meme, so much so I normally wouldn't dignify them with a response.<br/><br/>However, the comparisons between BB and Ozark highlight a flaw with this show's reviews and contemporary tv criticism at large. "Prestige garishness" is when a show so overtly panders to critics and NATAS that the effort is cringeworthy and often lacks the taste it so craves. And, it's true that miffed Prestige tropes run rampant throughout the so called 'embarrassment of riches' that is the 2017 TV landscape. However A 'Prestige Trope' isn't inherently a bad thing. Bateman (Ozark's star and director) flirts with some basic 'prestige tropes' but instead of falling face first into them, Bateman deftly subverts them. Compare Ozark first season against Breaking bad's slow burn of a first season, and we see two shows with similar premises and thematic elements however these show are vastly different. Obviously BB season 1 wins against Ozark season 1 in most conceivable categories (particularly in style, balance and protagonist character development) however Ozark's first season IMO comes ahead of BB s01 when it comes to pacing, cast wide character development and episode-to-episode entwining of thematic and symbolic elements with their plot.<br/><br/>Inversely I foresee the potential for underestimation to mislead many a-viewers to overlook this wonderful series--thinking this is anything like bloodlines (yuck, I get bored and a bad taste in my mouth just saying it). While Ben Mendelsohn is acting gift from the TV gods, bloodlines is a steaming pile of boredom. I almost skipped Ozark because I assumed from a trailer that Ozark would just be a snarkyer Bloodlines with high caliber actors. I was thankfully very very wrong. Ozark May make you want to grab a triple beam scale or a graphic calculator but I guarantee after watching you'll never climb out of water and onto a dock the same way again. Season 1 & 2 absolutely brilliant. Top show. But. But-but-but, I reckon, and I would be astonished if I am wrong, I reckon I won't like season 3.I can't say because I don't want to have a spoiler alert. Let's just say that I see where season 3 is going and I also see Hollywood loving season 3 cause it will fall in line with their view of the way the world should be - the end of our western civilisation ( that means more than what you think, only very few will get this- in 30 to 40 years what I said will mean everything) Are the bad reviews here. Everything has become politics. No one really cares about the show. They only care about their own political agenda and what they think are the biases of the show. It's racist it's too gay it's not gay enough it glorifies rednecks it's pro Trump it's anti this pro that blah blah blah blah. I'm so sick of people and hope everyone watching this show shoots themselves in the head. If you don't like the show don't watch it. Or do, and torture yourself and take it out on your family. Who cares? It's not Breaking Bad and it's not Longmire. It's Ozark. It's pretty good not great. Kinda slow not much plot and the blue filter and dark lighting is overdone. But if you like moody and you love to hate characters who are insanely evil you'll like it. Maybe. Or not. Hands down the best show around now. And as someone else said, I can't understand how critics criticized the second season. I also am enjoying it even more. And it's the perfect time to have great female characters who aren't the usual (as has been criticized for Skylar White, Carmella Soprano, and Abby Donovan) on so many shows. These are bad-ass women who are the ones who knock! Laura Linney owns this season which is difficult coming up against Julia Garner and Janet McTeer and the actress who plays Darlene. Can't wait for season 3, which I hope cuts Wendy loose! Every actor is so good, just wish it was less violent. First time watching and I was hooked. Good work and congratulations to all actors on a hit ! Great... Need season 3.. goes from one bad situation to another but it seems to stay alive each time. Season 2 is dark and chaotic. A soap opera with the cartel. Almost too much. First season edge of your seat and very entertaining. Downgraded and diluted with the next. More cartel, less priests getting shot with babies on the floor crying. Oh well Watched the 1st season and found it gripping, 2nd season bit long and drawn out. About a family who believes themselves to be decent but they end up involved in money laundering to protect themselves from a drug cartel murdering them. in the midst of crazy things happening to them whilst in Ozark, the viewer is taken through their traumatic journey of twists and turns in some unimaginable situations and for such a normal family they begin to manoeuvre themselves in the criminal world extremely well which is well somewhat surprising considering they don't want to be involved in criminal activities!! Worth watching first 2 seasons so far. The way Ozark has been done is just amazing! The aura it creates is just absolutely breathtaking production wise! Every character is at its best and the perfect for their roles. Dark and protective, this is a must watch, how subtly the messages are delivered is just too good and keeps the audience on adrenaline. A must watch! Excellent thriller with top of the class acting and weird characters. Both seasons are great with some minor ups and downs in intensity but whole story is intriguing, reminding of Breaking Bad. My girlfriend and I watched this show and damn, its awesome! Tense and suspenseful, we REALLY enjoyed it! Loved season 1. Season 2 has too many villains, characters have complete personality changes. Couldn't have had same writing team from season 1 Blue filter is digusting, it realy sucks. Why do you use blue filter? You muzt take some lessons from "better call saul" or " breaking bad". Please dont use blue filter. There are no light hearted moments in this season it just gets scarier with each episode.......... Jason Bateman is probably the most watchable actor for me and this definitely was a different type of role and show but he plays it with his usually ease. Anyway I watched the first series and was hooked with the twists and tension, the characters developed well and it had a bit of breaking bad about it. Then series 2 turned the dial up again and every episode is now carefully crafted to have a perfect goal, lots of awkward moments, twist and tension leading to the reveal. The female characters are pretty awesome, scary people and Bateman manages to remain calm and same throughout as his usual character. This is my new Breaking Bad and can't wait to see what happens next. Didnt think they would be able to make a second season as good as the first but I was wrong! Season 2 is just as dark and crazy as the first. This show is fantastically written. Love it All of the above makes Ozark one of the best new TV series at the moment. Highly recommend. Unexpected, psychological, smart. I'm a seasoned watcher of thrillers and this is in fact one of the best ones that I've watched in a decade. I never rate anything with a 10. If you are a Fan of Breaking Bad then you'll love Ozark. Jason plays a great part in this quirky story. His dysfunctional family get caught up pitting wits against the drug cartel. With many twists & turns to each episode that keep you watching for what comes next. This series is set against a beautiful back drop of the Ozark Mountains and the seedier parts of the country. I'm 4 episodes in & it seems like I've seen a few movies. The plot progression is constant and the dialogue is very well-written. What really sets this show apart though is the acting - the characters portrayed by Bateman and Linney are right in their lane, so to speak. Also really well shot and produced, you get the feeling of being immersed in rural Missouri (misery as some like to say) without having to physically be there. ** Spoiler and light humor ahead **<br/><br/>People launder money, everyone gets killed because the boss thinks there is money missing, apart from the main character who convinces the boss to start washing cash in some watery hillbilly part of the USA.<br/><br/>Enter the FBI sending a gay agent couple, one of which sleeps with the suspect he is investigating, broody moments on boats, full on kissing and messing around in hotel rooms, all because Netflix went totally SJW recently.<br/><br/>8 million gets washed by spending it, if it was that easy i would be in the money laundering business. Just buy a few Rollers and its laundered yay. <br/><br/>Then there is the elderly couple on the hill, killing people as if they are squatting flies and making drugs so they can buy more land so they can fight against the company that build a dam so they live on the hill now. Makes sense ? Oh they cut out a baby from a pregnant woman and dispose of the body in between sitting on rocking chairs, just because. <br/><br/>Then there is a young teenager who runs a strip club for the main character who electrocutes both her uncles, but at least she has a little bit of a problem with that emotionally, afterwards.<br/><br/>Then there is the angry daughter giving up virginity and a small boy who REALLY likes guns a lot. <br/><br/>It's a crazy mess and the season ending really cleans up.<br/><br/>Does the series make sense : Nope, does it entertain : Strangely yes, i quite liked it. And hey Netflix, go SJW all the way next time and have the FBI send a lady-boy 3 some to clean up the drug lords. The show begins with a compelling premise, but seems to bog down mid-season as the writers layer on the misfortunes for the central character. At times, I had the distinct feeling that script doctoring had led to some very contrived ideas to increase the odds against Bateman, particularly in relation to the local drug lords and their bizarre relationship with the local preacher. I felt compelled to watch it through to season's end, but felt annoyed by the conclusion. <br/><br/>Bateman is excellent, but some of the other characters, again, seem the work of an over- zealous script doctor. All that said, I think the show, to its credit, bears some similarity to Breaking Bad. One of the most compelling and satisfying parts of that show was the way the central character, an innocent man surrounded by crooks, began to dominate the low-lifes around him. Let's hope the over zealous script doctors of Ozark stop looking for ways to abuse their main characters and find many more ways for Bateman to serve up some humble pie. Hope I'm not the only one who feels this way...When it comes to Ozarks overall it was entertaining. The first 3 episodes are captivating in dialogue and adrenaline spiking from the second the cartels become involved. However after three episodes the premise becomes overwhelmed with pointless character development/dialogue as well as random nonsensical scenes to show off the cinematography. There are so many inaccurate preconceptions about the drug trade as well as very poorly thought out plot evolution. Two things that stick out drastically; the Mexican cartel traffics minimal amounts of heroin and Missouri does not have a suitable environment for poppy to grow (93% of the Worlds heroin comes from Afghanistan) and when the lead investigator turns out to be a homosexual they waste countless scenes with him telling people or forcing stupid stories that aren't even captivating or related to the plot. Very poor writing decisions. <br/><br/>If you like fictional crime dramas, Ozarks is good to the average viewer, however falls extremely short for me. Love Jason Bateman and the premise, but it was poorly executed and could have been better. Definitely no Breaking Bad, House of Cards or Boardwalk Empire. This is a show that would not exist without Breaking Bad. It hews closely, perhaps too closely to the plots already well-traveled by that extraordinary show. The strait-laced man who cares just a bit too much about "providing for his family" for his or their own good. This show's "innovations" has full frontal nudity and liberal use of the f-bomb don't really count. It does move much more quickly than Breaking Bad does which is probably an advantage.<br/><br/>Ozark is certainly a fun ride, and the lurid twists and turns of the first season led me to watch it in a weekend. I'm not going to spoil the fun of the surprises, but there are several, several delightful. Its lack of originality and wild untelegraphed plot swings definitely weaken the show though. For one signal to me of quality, despite having very much enjoyed the show, I have no interest in rewatching it. It is nice to see a TV show set outside of the usual suspects of New York, LA, or Chicago, even if many of the central characters are transplants. <br/><br/>On a side note, whoever films these Netflix originals seems inordinately obsessed with blue tinting. Almost every scene, particularly inside during the day, is stained a cold and lifeless blue. It makes for an interesting effect, but once noticed, it gets tedious. <br/><br/>This show feels like someone mixed together some of the best reviewed TV shows of the 2010s into a blender and made a drink out of it. It's certainly fun to watch but nothing more. <br/><br/>Which is just fine by me.<br/><br/>(I binged this in July 2017) So I can see what the heck is going on?<br/><br/>Seriously I the to try voice identification to figure out who's on screen. Do you watch your own scenes? Due some scenes the screen is actually all black. I know you know who your filming but we don't. It's a good show and more importantly, all female characters are really good written . They are strong they stand on theirs own feet , and it's all looks really natural. Well down !!! There's a difference between characters that you love to hate, and characters that you hate. In Ozark, the characters fell in the later column. I simply do not like watching shows with characters that I hate. Period.<br/><br/>After watching the first episode, I also knew that the makers of this show were more interested in shock value than developing relatable characters that the audience will actually care about. That for me is a no-go as well.<br/><br/>Giving this a 2 because the production quality was good, the actors were good. But, the show left a bad taste in my mouth. So, it's not something that I'm eager to get back to. On the hunt for my next Netflix show. This one is just not for me. People often say we are in the salad days of television. A new Golden Age. To a large extent that's true. Now comes the rush of edgy, slightly perverse, without being gratuitous of course.<br/><br/>Thanks to the complete Hindenburg like second seasons of True Detective , and Fortitude, the second season of even the best of shows is no longer guaranteed. The thrush of taste towards the new, and the rejection of anything even a few years old, does not bode well for a show running more than two seasons. <br/><br/>Netflix, and Amazon hedge their bets with the six episode season, and that's like... well... not good. <br/><br/>Just a decade ago, if any of you Millennials believe the past has any use other than the bones of a nice urban loft, even edgy cable series' like "Queer as Folk" had a 22 episode season. Quickly that number decreased to,13, then 12, and now 10. <br/><br/>The CBS drama still follows the old rules for the old people. They stand alone though, with ridiculous, sappy, emotion driven shows like The Newsroom, and The West Wing, which are now thankfully in a store house next to the Love Boat and Fantasy Island reruns. <br/><br/>And honestly, the next time I have to see an autopsy on screen I hope to God it's my own. CSI, JAG, Blue Bloods, and Law and Order, are on their way to the Murder She Wrote, and Scarecrow and Mrs. King scrap heap. <br/><br/>We have also been allowed to learn from some honest mistakes. Twin Peaks, and The X-Files were really good on analog cable and a 25" tube set, why do they suck so much now?<br/><br/>And no one seems to have the guts to stick with a good series. Poor beleaguered Steven Soderberg. I mean he's rich I'm sure, but he has had so much good material wasted and dying a premature death. First Spalding Gray, then the genius K-Street, with perhaps the most unrealized cliff hanger of all time, then the Knick which HBO somehow managed to negatively promote. It was almost like the little plug before the show should have said, "It's not our fault, it's HBO." <br/><br/>Of course CBS, the harbinger of terrible taste for decades used Soderberg's name to sell it's soft core porn show about call girls. Shame on you CBS. The only good thing I can say about them is they are so out of touch they didn't kill the Twin Peaks remake. Which makes the cackle of David Lynch just a little sweeter. <br/><br/>HBO is changing. I don't think Westworld, The Sopranos, or The Wire would be greenlit at the new HBO. And while I love two, and like the other of those shows, that formula got a little old.<br/><br/>I was really upset when they killed Luck for killing off a few of it's equine subjects, and Vinyl got caught up in a management battle and never saw a second season. <br/><br/>I binge watched The Sopranos, The Wire, and Boardwalk Empire, and I kind of feel like I've seen the second through fifth season of Vinyl and Luck already. <br/><br/>Amazon and Netflix seem like their taste for the cancellation jugular knows no bounds. Mad Dogs didn't make to season two, which was positively shocking. <br/><br/>But the W.G. Snuffy Walden soundtrack laden Grace and Frankie, Transparent, and I Love Dick, seem to still have some legs. Take The West Wing, change some genders and sexual orientations, and there you go. These shows were designed for Millennials to watch with their Baby Boomer Grandparents. And why not? Worked for the iPhone. <br/><br/>But sadly, I think most Millennials would be just as happy with images of dogs walking in and out of loft apartments on their way to the food truck to pay $12 for a roach coach burrito with a credit card. <br/><br/>So that, as usual, leaves us Xers and Ys with less, but it's still quite a bounty "I must say!"<br/><br/>So this is our reward for having to endure our greedy parents and intensely shallow children. We get Ozark, Halt, and Catch Fire, Fargo, Snowfall, and of course Better Call Saul, the Burns and Allen of our generation.<br/><br/>Jason Bateman, and Laura Linney are great of course, but the story is interesting and characters diverse without seeming "transparenty"; that's my new verb. <br/><br/>It's a small story, dark and believable. And not one autopsy.<br/><br/>It could have used a little more creative flair, like the "Sausage Factory" botched FBI investigation in the Sopranos. I think with all the crap flying around the writers and producers may have used a bit too much restraint. But the Cohen Brothers, aren't backing it, fortunately however, neither is Steven Soderberg, so I anticipate a second season.<br/><br/>Oh you wanted a plot synopsis? No you didn't. When was the last time an Xer watched something based on the story, it's all about the cast. That's the bag of crap we bring to the table. I still think it's pimentos in the Thanksgiving dinner of crap served up by the Baby Boomers.<br/><br/>You know the greatest generation watched Fantasy Island the The Love Boat religiously every Saturday night. They never expected social commentary, and titillation was provided by a Charo guest appearance and not an eviscerated carcus on a slab. I started watching this show because of Jason Bateman and he does justice to the role of barty a financial adviser. The show is very interesting with such a nice story and strong main characters. The thing which I loved about Ozark is that the story line never leaves you bored, as there is always something going on. I would suggest anyone who likes geeky people breaking some rules and kicking ass at it should watch Ozark! First, regardless of racism in this show, it is another "Let's do a quick Breaking Bad clone" show which is bad enough in itself. However I really don't understand how people who filmed this didn't finish in court as they openly promote racism in the show. Other shows at least do it in a subtle way but these guys are taking racism step further. 
I am considering canceling my Netflix account because they allowed this abomination to appear in their offering. Only reason I still didn't do it is because of Japanese and Korean TV shows.<br/><br/>If you are a Mexican or Muslim and give this show anything but 1 star you are crazy. Because American families care more about their families than to letnwhat happened be ok!
We are all very upset about this!
I am guessing/hoping the actor who plays Ben Davis just needed to leave for a bit to make another show?!?!! Never would've watched this if it wasn't for lockdown, I have binged watched the entire series 1-3, has been incredible, written beautifully, characters are just are on point, I cannot knock this show at all, brilliant show I started season 1 and I have not shut it off since!! All the characters with overall story are extremely appreciated, but the man Marty Byrde is like a legend that deserves a grand salute. Simply the best episode from the serie and it is just so emotional and heartbreaking... The music in the correct order, the dialogues have the correct words and the emotions are just... The beautiful part from the episode!
√∞≈∏‚Äò≈í It was absolutely gripping till the 3rd season. They pushed back the kids which were one of the best parts of the show. They introduced a too personal Helen Pierce which was offputting to say the least and they introduced Ben: a very weird character that we were supposed to empathize with him but can't on any level.
Super disappointed!! Expertly written and acted show so far. There are very few shows that can keep going without becoming redundant, Ozark manages to keep tension on edge while not becoming boring in the slightest.
I can't wait for the next season!! Recommended for anyone who likes breaking bad, great story line Was recommended to me by a friend. Ozark is one of the best shows I've watched yet. When Marty Byrde enters in some illegal business with the Mexican Cartel, he moves his entire family to the Ozarks in order to launder money for them. There, the family quickly encounters trouble as they run into a redneck family called the Snells. Meanwhile, when trying to figure out different ways to clean up the money Marty starts to meet different people in the town and that's where I'm going to stop talking. I started this show with zero expectations as this genre doesn't really appeal to me but as soon as the first episode ended I was quickly intrigued but the show really found its pace during the third episode when it started building up the characters. I'm not a fan of Jason Bateman but his performance here proved that he's better at drama than he is at comedy. The thing that I liked most about this show is that characters actually evolve,you see them becoming improved versions of themselves whether it's for the better or worse and you can tell the difference between them from the first episode and the season finale. If you're a fan of the Breaking Bad genre or any kind of crime shows this the series for you Wow just wow i mean this show is the most exciting show since Breaking Bad Want to see great acting ? Watch this, its perfection simple as. Up there with the Breaking Bads and Sopranos pure tv heaven. A couple of unbelievable weaknesses - such as a thousand bullets going through a stationary car, not killing the 3 occupants - stops me from giving this a ten. There are other glaring holes in situations but I don't want to be pedantic: this is exciting, well made television at it's best.<br/><br/>I feel sorry for Peter Mullan, because he is so good at portraying baddies he has become thoroughly type-cast. Having said that, the same could be applied to Jason Bateman: he seems to have a penchant for steady, good-guy roles.<br/><br/>The first series started off brilliantly, and was a large carrot that had to be chased. Although I felt the middle episodes slowed the thing down a bit, the drama was still there and it finished off superbly. However, the second series really upped the anti and each episode was unmissable. Thank goodness there's to be a third. Really enjoying this, keep it going. Got the potential to be one of the best new dramas. The moral delama here, is more convincing and grounded than Walt from Breaking Bad. Rick Perez was exceptional in his debut performance on Ozark episode 1 season 2. Bringing the true cartel feeling and foreboding danger to the screen fueled this latest season's excitement. I look forward to seeing this up and coming new artist's future projects. Seriously nerve wrecking with an amazing story and amazing plots, so many good characters and twists , always keeps you interested
Can't wait for more episodes I'm really sad I finished it quickly and I can't wait for more episodes Watched first series which was superb just binge watched the second series and it was even better! Hats off to the script writers on keeping the intensity level up in every episode . This can only be achieved by having such a talented cast of actors and actresses . I can see small glimpses of Breaking Bad and hope that Netflix allows it to continue as long. Roll on season 3 Just finished season 2,fantastic old fashion yarn top performances throughout.This and Bloodline showcases great American film making
like they use to. The production and acting on this show is great. It's also interesting and shows the lengths criminal go to launder their cash. 
The downside is the show is grim. There's no humour. I know it's not supposed to be funny but the show is very morbid and violent. If your not phased by this then you will enjoy it. Ozark is dark, dirty, violent and funny. This is binge worthy tv at it's best.it pulls in episode by episode and gets darker by the minute. I love this show, was worried about season 2, but it's actually getting better with every episode. Bateman's Marty Byrde drags his whole family into this money laundering debocle and it just spirals out of control. Laura Linney is excellant as his wife Wendy Byrde, who really evolves into this evil manipulative person, it's like second nature to her, so maybe she was already flawed. The entire cast is great, but they all play very unlikeable evil people, which could turn some people off. But It's what happens to people who lie, cheat, steal, and cover up what they do, regardless if it's small time or big business/politics. Ruth, Marty's sidekick for lack of a better term is a very interesting character, her father is a piece of garbage so we see how she got to be how she is. The only likable person in the entire show is Wyatt, Ruth's cousin, I'm rooting for him. The series is very intriguing and shows what greed, crime and drugs does to people, and those who get dragged into it. The show does a good job showing corruption from every level, local, state, politics, police, business, and how people use others dirty deeds to force them to do their dirty deeds.<br/><br/>If you liked shows like Bloodline, Breaking Bad, you will probably like this show. I think it really starts getting good in Season 2, the end of every episode I look forward to the next one. I like to watch an episode every few days, I actually find it better that way. Gripping, well written, brutal, binge-worthy drama. Great job Jason Bateman! I haven't had anything keep me interested lately until Ozark. I was hooked on the show immediately. Can't wait for season three. Keep them coming! I really enjoyed by marathon box set, seasons 1 & 2, love the characters, the twists & plots, it's entertainment in a nutshell, some of the events took me by surprise which rules out predictability, well done Ozark. Thanks to Netflix for providing me with screeners for Season Two, they are always welcome!<br/><br/>Season One ended with uncertainty when Bateman was stuck as a middle man brokering a deal between the Cartel and the local Ozark heroin dealers which went horribly wrong when they murdered Del, a Cartel boss.<br/><br/>Season Two opens with this same uncertainty and pushes it to the max over the course of 10 episodes as people begin to crumble under pressure and new threats arise, morality really goes downhill and has a truly unsettling finale.<br/><br/>We only really get two main new characters this season , as the Byrdes need to expand the operation further by attempting to build a casino, in pursuing getting it approved they have to turn to a wealthy local man to influence politics. 
I wasn't really a fan of his character but he does seem to serve a purpose, our other new character however is great, taking the place of Del(the now dead cartel boss) Actress Janet McTeer plays the Cartels supposed lawyer (who appears to be actually pretty high up in the cartel) she gives of an extremely menacing and creepy vibe in this role that seems to be written for her.<br/><br/>Laura Linney's Wendy gets a really interesting arc over these 10 new episodes and goes to a place that I didn't see coming.
The real star for me at least in Season Two was Ruth, played pitch perfectly by Julia Garner.
She gets a huge amount of very emotional material as she tries to work through increasingly stressful situations, some of which are caused by her abusive father who has a larger role compared to last season when he was contained to prison.<br/><br/>The season comes to a crescendo in the final two episodes where a lot happens but somehow it still feels well paced and really packs an interesting ending.<br/><br/>Ozark Season Two is largely a great continuation of the first and sports some absolutely stellar performances & directing. from the looks of it , Season 3 is going to be very very interesting to watch.<br/><br/>Ozark comes highly recommended, you can catch season two on Netflix worldwide on August 29th.<br/><br/>Thanks again to Netflix for providing the screeners An interesting story with perfect actor in main role gives us high quality serial wich can surely become a good and not useless spend of time. <br/><br/>The story telling in Ozark always lead to thoughts like ''What if it could have happened to me?'' Through all season you quastion actions of all actors. What they are doing, why they are doing it and what would you do at their place? What is right and what is wrong? How far you need to go to keep your family alive and survive yourself? Do you need to lie? Do you need to steal? Do you need to kill? Who you need to become? <br/><br/>This show reminds me such serials as ''Breaking bad'', ''Fargo'', ''Better Call Saul''. If you love serious shows that lead you to think and you already watched all best ones, this one is definitely for you. It takes me a while to get into TV shows yet this captured me from episode 1. As a viewer you become to understand the characters and see why certain events happen. Last episode was amazing and can't wait to see Series 2. Do you need a hint about what to think about all these characters? Ray Bradbury's The Martian Chronicles is referenced about midway through and the hillbilly boy says something about how transplants never fit in to their new home and ultimately everyone is a transplant trying to put down roots in a land that would rather shake them off. Do you hate the characters. Good. You aren't supposed to like anyone in this show except Marty. He is the Everyman seeing the world with new eyes. Its sort of reminiscent of breaking bad, just more grounded and from another perspective. The show's main cast are all likeable and the writing is grounded, which I like. If the second season can avoid the temptations of trying to make everything bigger and more action packed, whilst also having a good story and character building then i'm bumping this to a 9. I started out liking this show, with its Breaking Bad similarities, but ended up just holding on to see what would happen. Along the way, the writers just piled on way too much jeopardy. By the season's halfway mark, the protagonist has not one, or two but three, four, perhaps five (I lost count) antagonists he must outsmart and outlive. There was never an episode when the story could breathe. It was just more and more jeopardy for the Birde family, and more zaniness creeping into the story. It's as if the writers room became a "what if..." room and anything goes was the theme. Still, it was fun to watch for the most part, but this has to be a very dark comedy-pitch black. Wow really love this series! Jason Bateman as the main protagonist delivered a superb performance. This series reminds me of Breaking Bad. Love the cinematography and how it's dark(pun intended) and gripping. Would really want Martin Byrde to be more of a bad-ass in the next season. I just can't stress enough how this show is so awesome because I'm not good playing with words. But this is it, one of the few shows that made me committed and captivated to watch until the end unlike other TV shows. Otherwise, I'd just bail halfway through. A home run by Netflix! Thankfully there are so many new series out there it can be hard to determine where to invest your time. I've always liked several of the actors in this series and although Jason Bateman usually makes me laugh out loud, this is not Arrested Development. He deserves an Emmy nomination. This series will have you hooked from the first episode and there are scenes that will challenge you not to look away, but the cast, director (seems to be Bateman for many if not all episodes) and great photography successfully create some of the best suspense, a la Hitchcock, available today so don't flinch! Grown up watching Bateman in always various but entertaining characters, but Netflix have done it again in allowing experience and their indomitable trust in such to put together a marvellous piece of work. Bateman has received some freedom and time in his process with this excellent show. Of course this was before I learned that he had also directed the first couple of episodes, after which my respect for Bateman as a master of storytelling has now been affirmed. Dark tense thrilling but well told series, well worth putting to the top of your list. Long may Netflix continue to put their money where their respect is. Even though I've only gotten through three episodes so far, I felt compelled to submit this brief review, not of the series overall, but of one particular performance. I give the series an 8 out of 10 through Episode 3, but I'm giving Julia Garner's performance as Ruth Langmore a very generous 2 out of 10. Her obnoxiously over-acted, stereotypical southern accent would be the main reason...the hair doesn't help, but that's not really her fault...I have truly been enjoying this series so far, but her performance might just make it impossible for me to keep going...in much the same way as Robin Weigert's ridiculously over-acted Calamity Jane in Deadwood forced me to stop watching after maybe six episodes. There are literally tens of thousands of TV and movie options out there these days - one badly-performed character, and I just move on. If you have the time, this well-written and wonderfully produced (but highly predictable) show will be a good addition to your binge- watching arsenal, but I had a hard time believing Jason Bateman as the main character. He's simply not dark enough, and I see that people are comparing him to Walter White from Breaking Bad - to which I say "apples and oranges." Also, to base an entire story around money laundering is a big risk, because most viewers haven't a clue as to how it works. <br/><br/>Ultimately Ozark falls flat in a few areas. <br/><br/>1) Disaffection from the get-go. Yes, TBH I couldn't stand the main characters from the start of the show. This doesn't bode well, and fails to retain viewer interest. <br/><br/>2) Nothing to gain, nothing to lose. You'll see pretty quickly that this is the state of the main characters, as well as the viewer (you). To me, a story has to have a prize at the end of the arc, and after three episodes there was no reward in sight. If the main characters are deplorable then the prize has to be something the viewer would want, otherwise you've lost your audience. <br/><br/>3) Jason Bateman - don't get me wrong, I love Jason Bateman's works across the board, but for some reason I didn't buy his performance in this show. It's possible I've seen him in too many comedies. He certainly shows his talent as an actor in this show, but I honestly feel that he was miscast. <br/><br/>In the end it feels like this show was an attempt to re-create Breaking Bad without trying to look too much like Breaking Bad, with enough deviations to make it original and even somewhat enjoyable, but even after all that, it's missing the key component that makes a show watchable in the first place - interest. Great show with a very interesting premise,great writing,beautiful cinematography.The best part of it though are the performances by the actors.I always thought that Jason Bateman is an excellent actor,very underrated that's been kinda type cast as a comedy only actor.I loved him in The Gift(2015) and I really think he's amazing as Marty Byrde, plus he directed 4 episodes and did a really good job.Other standouts for me are Laura Linney,Esai Morales,Marc Menchaca and I thought Julia Garner was absolutely fantastic as Ruth. I hope the show gets a second season and I strongly recommend it.If you liked Breaking Bad you're definitely gonna enjoy Ozark. Had no idea this would be that good... I'm totally hooked! So many twists and surprises. And the acting is superb! Jason Bateman is really fantastic in this. And what's great is that it is so different from everything else... Despite everything that happens to them, it still feels realistic and believable. Every episode tops the previous one. What a treat!!!! Can't wait for Season 2 There's a lot going for Ozark. It's well written, well acted, has an intriguing storyline and there is always just enough going on that it keeps you wanting to see what comes next. However, there are 3 major issues that I have with it: <br/><br/>1 - Not enough story - You always know a show is in trouble when it has to pad out its episodes with a full flashback episode. A common criticism with Netflix shows is that they don't have enough story for the number of episodes they produce and the same was true here. You could easily have trimmed a lot of this show down and the show would have been better for it. <br/><br/>2 - Seen it all before - Early this year, I watched Amazon's Sneaky Pete, and you know what, this show has almost the all the same story beats. A man is really good at something illegal, get's in over his head with some really bad people and is forced to come up with a lot of money (or launder it in this case) in a specific amount of time to save their family. In order to do this, they must move to and reinvent themselves in a more rural setting, screwing over a lot of locals along the way. Of course whilst in the small town, they also get entangled with local criminal drama. Finally, everything that can go wrong does go wrong because you need to string out this small story across 10 episodes. <br/><br/>3 - Acting is flat - Jason Bateman and Laura Linney are pretty big names, but their acting is a little one note. Both actors have a tendency to play themselves in everything they are in and this is the same here. Sadly both actors have a flat/one note style of acting which makes the show feel like it's plodding along at times. When making that comparison to sneaky Pete again, there you have Giovani Ribisi and Bryan Cranston, both actors with a lot of flair which brings the show to life a bit. <br/><br/>Overall, this is a good show, but as I have mentioned a few times now I feel like I have seen it before. I watched Sneaky Pete and really enjoyed that earlier this year, and I felt that this show was the poorer for it. The thing is though, I have a feeling that it was because I saw that show first and it felt fresher. If I had seen this one first then it might have been different. <br/><br/>7.4/10 and would have easily made 8 stars if it wasn't for the filler episode. I am now 5 episodes in and quite like the show. The writing is original, the script is interesting, the characters develop in an acceptable pace, the story is told properly and not rushed at all.<br/><br/>I will not go into story-line details, shortly put: a money launderer for the Mafia forcefully relocates and tries to regain the trust of the cartel.<br/><br/>I see only one problem. Unfortunately that's Bateman. As a comedic actor I never really found him convincing, nor extraordinarily talented. Generally, what I have seen, he filled the room while being surrounded by more talented actors.<br/><br/>In Ozark he spoils the whole thing a bit with his flat-face. No emotions, no expressions, no characteristics that stand out, nor any skills that would justify him being there other than being able to remember a script. Once again, he is supplemented and complimented by extremely talented people like Laura Linney and Julia Garner. By far, the best episode of the season was the pilot. The remainder while good, don't near match up to the first encounter. The story tries hard to be different, but eventually boils down to the same premise of many of the genre... and it's just not that interesting a yarn. Violent, and again not so different than bunches of others The cast is solid, notably the leads, and all the rest down to the last one are completely believable and perfect for and in their roles. Several are right from the start standouts, you'll see who they are. And Laura Linney has been around for quite awhile now, and looking back, it is hard to find a production she has been in where she does not do exceptional work. She is one of America's truly great actors.. and here again she gives an award worthy performance. The first season did somewhat come to tidy conclusion, but of course with the obligatory unfinished story-line threads exist... so S2 has someplace to pick up from. Does it go multiple years remains to be seen, and will really depend on the strength of the next episodes should there be any. It would be nice to see LL again.. for her, many would return that might not otherwise. And should the powers that be make the decision to have her with a more prominent place in future episodes (along with Julia Garner) that would be a very good thing. I do. I believe God is inside me, I've met him. God is me, I am the creator of my own story.<br/><br/>And if that is true then the story what you have written and produced here is like a training manual for how to be that God, that true you.<br/><br/>They're are those characters who are God of God's, but they're really just a higher vibrating version of others, not a true God.<br/><br/>Your show shows there cannot be one God, but we must work together to live our true lives and speak our truth, then each one of us will be true God's.<br/><br/>In this show who is the truest soul?<br/><br/>I love when he gets in the car and he's crying because....no spoilers right? Episode 1 was amazing.. but episode 2 was so slow and boring - I can't sit through anymore episodes with that format. But some people like that.. so I guess it's not for me.
I also didn't understand where the storyline was going, and it's not really relatable to me why he stayed in that living situation. I feel that it might be the type of series that is relatable for people with the same or similar demographics as the main character. I love the show, it is dark, gritty, suspenseful at times, and just fun to watch. My beefs with the show are the writing and or acting. I have no problem with profanity but the show uses the f word so much it just seems unrealistic and makes some of the characters seem like they are overacting trying to play a certain role. It is almost cheesy and annoying at times. My second beef is that an anti gun liberal wrote a scene where a kid goes and makes a straw purchase for a gun with the help of a store clerk which is a felony on both accounts and then when the gun is given to the actual buyer it is a fully automatic which is not even possible. It was just another example of liberals pushing the idea that anyone can buy a machine gun in the U.S. which is isn't true. Tremendous acting and writing all along, but Tom Pelphrey NEEDS an Emmy for his performance in S3!!! My God! And Laura Linney too. Wonderful portrayal of mental illness by Tom (as Ben). Spectacular performance that needs recognition and award. I'm praying for at least another 2-3 seasons Netflix! I started watching this series with an indifferent mind as I didnt know what to expect. 2 weeks later I've watched all 3 seasons and I'm having withdrawal symptoms. Bring on season 4 for please! Excellent plot, great twists! 5% happy time
95% Drama, murder, blood all kind of atrocities "Darlene" played by Lisa Emery delivers a mix of soft and hard, kind and cruel in Season 3. In addition, she adopts an infant and her boyfriend "Wyatt" (Charlie Tahan) is young enough to be her grandson. Watching these two together might just be the "American Dream." A terrific series that will drag you to finish it. You will never get bored especially when get to to season two. For the first time, the second season is better than the first one. I felt sorry for Marty and kept asking myself, how much can a person endure? Thanks for the great time I had and hoped it will never end. I can't wait for season three. When Season 2 dropped at the end of August this year I'd not seen season 1. For the next week and a half I watched both S1 and S2. This is not a healthy thing to do because there is way too much turmoil to deal with in such a short amount of time. As has been well documented this is a very dark show with compromised characters with few rays of hope or calm on the horizon. Characters tend to be one-dimensional flawed persons having made bad choices and only trying to survive through the terrible messes they've put themselves in. There is little love passed around. And despite this I loved this show though I was often in a state of binge watching anxiety. I'll have a tough time waiting a year or more for Season 3.<br/><br/>Though most characters were largely lousy people, I came to appreciate the character Rachel and her interactions with Marty. She was a kind of normal person with kind of normal interactions with Marty. She was a ray of light in the darkness. But as we all know anyone in Marty Byrde's orbit ends up in a worse place and Rachel surely did. Her plight was heartbreaking. Fast forward to and through Season 2 where Rachel hit rock bottom and was under relentless pressure. Despite all the turmoil she'd undergone as a result of Marty and what she knew about him, she offered a moment of kindness to him and one where he responded in kind; in an emotional way. Fast forward past the end of episode 8 she is gone ... to Florida?? And with that, I believe their relationship changes. So in thinking about what part my favorite character plays in Season 3, I've come to the realization that she is free from Petty and will be cleaned up (good), in charge of and again owning the Blue Cat outright and with Marty out of the picture (also good). It's possible with the end of season 2; we've seen the last of Rachel and the Blue Cat (unfortunate). If this happens, I'll miss them. I love this show. I love the cast. Its edgy and thrills come left and right, shocking you just when its least expected. When Season 2 finally came out I wanted to start allover from the beginning of Season 1. Now I can't wait for Season 3. Great acting, good story, it's Deserve more Than 8.4 rating, all elements of series are very good can't wait For season 3 1) The use of on screen text dialogue. There is a scene where two characters are having a 'mute' conversation in person with their phones to spoil an FBI wire and the screen gets plastered with running text conversation. Come on Mr. Director! That is sloppy, lazy and immensely distracting and annoying. <br/><br/>2) The use of 'fast-forwards' ie: show a scene then flash "Two hours earlier" or "Three days before" and show the backstory. Hey, I'm not 8 years old. You can keep my attention with standard linear editing ya know. Chopping up the time-line is amateurish at best. Completely unnecessary considering the rest of the series was shot without it. Stop jumping the shark. You almost lost me twice this season with crappy directing decisions.<br/><br/>In general, I like season two. It's mostly a repeat of season one....great characters, great acting, sudden violence and every episode is basically another "how are they going to get out of this one" as they dig themselves further into their complicated web. The best show on TV right now. Darkness, with a heart... Perhaps the purest reflection of the absurdity of the modern human condition... Both seasons are brilliant. Netflix has something special here. Much like The Wire (my #1 show of all time) and Breaking Bad (my #2 show of all time) what I find most fascinating about Ozark is that it offers an incredibly deep and unflinching perspective on drug trafficking from production, to distribution, to business, to legal, to politics, to law enforcement. <br/><br/>What I find most entertaining about Ozark is it's candid personal/human perspective from extreme poverty, to middle class, to ultra wealthy. Seeing all of the facets of both the industry and people effected is vital to understanding something as polarizing and complex as drug trafficking. <br/><br/>There is something so quintessentially existential about the chain reaction of events and the snowball effect of decisions made that allows me to feel a certain level of empathy or distain for characters that are all too often misunderstood. You combine all of that with one of the best produced, best written and best television drama in history and you have a complete picture of Ozark. Captivating, Exhilarating, Brilliant.
Jason Bateman as the protagonist Martin Bryde and also in the director's shoes creates a uniquely sensational outcome.
The background score, the supporting cast have never been better.
The dark tone, the writing and the perfect pace of this show makes it one of the best Netflix Original TV series.<br/><br/>Season 1 was phenomenal, and it's now back for a sophomore run.
Give it a run.
Not to be missed.
Welcome to Ozark. A trusted friend told me to binge Ozark before the start of season 2 after I turned her on to Yellowstone. I was skeptical because I didn't see a hot actress in the cast, but I gave it a shot and watched the season in two days. WARNING, it is terribly disturbing to say the least. Incredible acting, Laura Linney's best acting role ever. I always liked her but this was out of her comfort zone and she rose to the occasion. Quite frankly, the whole cast did. No spoilers, just watch and be prepared for feelings you may never have experienced before. This is for me, the best Netflix show to date. Well written, wonderfully acted, nicely paced, gritty and funny. Can't wait for season 2. Must watch show you will not be disappointed. I can't wait for the next season coming Aug 30. /refers to Season 1/<br/><br/>Recent years I have somehow moved away from US drama/crime series as I have found the UK and Scandinavian ones catchier. But thanks to some references and promotion materials (incl. IMDB) I have run into series like Ozark - with distinct characters and performances, solutions without external intervention, events developing in narrow areas, thrill mixed with personal intertwinings, etc. <br/><br/>Well, one can always question the plausibility of depicted crimes in a democratic society, but if well explained and expressed, then you follow the course of events without wtf! and blah! feelings. And if complemented by beautiful environment, pleasant performances (Bateman was a surprise, usually I am not too fond of the movies he participates) and the scenes with twists where do you not know how to react as comic and tragic are intertwined.<br/><br/>All in all, I am looking forward to Season 2 already. This show, from the very first episode, is fantastic. From the very first lines uttered by Jason Bateman, it is apparent that this show is going to be very dark and also very interesting. The main thing that attracted me to this show in the first place is the casting choice of having Jason Bateman in a very serious and dark role, which is unlike most his roles (excluding The Gift which was a very dark movie). And I must say, along with the writing and directing, (of which Bateman does on a few episodes) Bateman is what makes this show so phenomenal. From the very first time he is on screen to the last frame of the season, it is apparent that he has committed to his role and is giving his all. He is extremely believable and never seems out of place speaking the dialogue that he was given. Laura Linney is also a very positive acting force in this show, particularly during some heated arguments that she gets into with Bateman's character later in the season. Even the child actors, while not fantastic, do a great job working with the material they were given. This show also has a very interesting story. While some people have compared it to Breaking Bad, I can surely say that this show is a beast all of its own. This show is extremely dark and from the get-go does not shy away from on-screen violence and terror. Ozark overall is every single quality I enjoyed about Breaking Bad and other dark shows, and even brings more to the table in terms of storytelling and acting. While this show has only aired its first season, and therefore I cannot make a complete judgment on the show, the first season is absolutely fantastic. The only issue I have with the season is how it ended. It just seemed to all come together so clean and that there were almost no consequences awaiting Bateman's family in the show. However, I am very excited to see where they take this show next, as I have no idea where they are going to go. Phenomenal writing, terrific acting, great cinematography, great show. I've always liked Jason Bateman from way back when he first started appearing on our screens a few decades ago. His TV and films are usually quite good. I guess he picks his projects well. I checked out his latest offerings on IMDB and found his new TV series Ozark. Some good reviews and quite a high rating. I started watching the first episode with high hopes and it didn't disappoint. It has a cast of great actors and good sub plot lines. Sadly the wheels started falling off in episode 2. The gaping holes in the story and the huge leaps of faith you have to take were to say the least quite insulting to someone with average intelligence. The writing must have been by committee as the story line has such compromises and some quite unbelievable bumps in the road. Who in their right mind would tell their adolescent children 'dad is a money launderer for the mob?' Who leaves their young kids in charge of 8 million dollars? Who leaves books proving you're laundering money around for anyone to read? There are countless examples of such stupidity littered throughout this series. Are we supposed to think Marty Byrde and his wife are idiots? As this is the way the story line at times portrays them. In fact the story telling gets so stale at points you can actually see what's about to happen. I found myself at points hoping what I thought was about to unfold on the screen wouldn't transpire. Each time I had to question the writer's competence. Why would they be so lazy? I just had to ignore these irritating moments, of which there are several. This series could easily of have been a 10 had they told the writers to come up with a better way of moving the storyline on. Certainly it's a good series but with some major issues that make you question why did that just happen, did they just say that? Perhaps what I'm missing from this series is that even fairly bright people can be quite naive and dim-witted when pressure is applied to their ordinary mundane lives. All that said I can't wait for season 2. I've always liked Jason Bateman from way back when he started appearing on our screens. His TV and films are usually of a high standard. I checked out his latest offerings on IMDB and found Ozark. Some good reviews and quite a high rating, as TV shows go. So I started watching the first episode with high hopes and it didn't disappoint. It has some great actors and good plot lines. That was until the wheels started falling off in episode 2 and either the writers are quite dumb or they thought the average viewers IQ would be in double digits. The gaping holes in the story line and the huge leaps of faith you have to take were to say the least insulting to someone with average intelligence. How anyone could give this series a 10 is beyond me. The writing is simply not that good. Sure a solid 8 but 10 no chance. The story line does not resonate with people who question motives and action. Who in their right mind would tell their kids 'dad is a money launderer for the mob?' Who leaves their young kids in charge of 8 million dollars? Who leaves books proving you're laundering money around for anyone to read? There are countless examples of such stupidity littered throughout this series. Are we supposed to think Marty Byrde and his wife Laura Linney are idiots? As this is the way the story line portrays them. In fact the story telling gets so stale at points you can actually tell what's about to happen. I found myself at points hoping what I thought was about to happen wouldn't. Each time I had questioned the writer's competence. Why would they be so lazy why? I just had to ignore it and dispel belief, like I do when watching a new James Bond film. This series could have been a 10 had they employed better writers who took their time to think of different ways to achieve the desired story line. I was left thinking if natural selection is indeed a thing this whole family needs whacking to guarantee their gene pool is eradicated from the planet. Saying that the son might get a pass as he seems the most credible member of the family. Certainly this is a good series but with some major issues to anyone who thinks about and questions what they're watching. OVERALL: Show has flaws, but I just let it go and enjoy the roller-coaster.<br/><br/>FLAWS:
The writers do force the drama here and there. There ARE scenes where you roll your eyes, Examples (spoilers)
eg1. 
Every villain is a prolific storyteller. Whenever you see a villain, get your mug of hot chocolate and get comfortable, because you're going to be there a while. The villain's story always has a moral, which is that the villain is a very bad person. <br/><br/>The villains, after telling their story, usually shoot their audience in the head, which is confusing as a lecture-format. My professors used to use stories to help us remember things. But my professors didn't shoot us in the head after teaching us stuff, because that makes the material harder to remember. So I think these villains have a lot to learn about education. <br/><br/>eg2. 
There's a scene where the real-estate agent's mother gets hit by a truck. It's one of these scenes where a vehicle doesn't make any noise, and no one sees it coming until it's 2 feet from the victim. I see a lot of this lately, vehicles that are outside the frame of the shot so the characters just don't notice that said vehicle has been bearing down on them for the last mile. <br/><br/>Another problem with the show is that it tries a little too hard to be gloomy, especially the soundtrack. There was more humor in early episodes and I think that worked better than the pure gloom we get in the end. <br/><br/>POSITIVES
The characters change in satisfying ways. 
Just when you think the characters might be getting too unlikeable, they grow or show kindness (although you have to wait for it). <br/><br/>The writers do a good job of managing the forgivability of the main characters, so we know where they stand morally, and we can feel comfortable rooting for them. I was really surprised with this show. I went into it expecting a knock-off attempt at Breaking Bad. Although it does remind me a bit of Breaking Bad it's quite different. This show takes place in a very rural area and the main character isn't some type of highly intelligent bad ass. He is a standard guy that toke an offer to make more money for his family by laundering for a drug cartel. Everything goes sideways and you watch as he tries to keep his family together. <br/><br/>The acting and script is amazing. It toke me 2 episodes to get into it, and really glad I did. Would recommend you give it a try! This show was a Netflix A+. Jason Bateman did an absolutely astounding job with his role, as did all the actors in the show. So much was packed into the episodes, and there are so many directions the writers could take the next season, it's impossible not to hold my breath in wait. Brilliant. I initially saw this advertised and thought *sigh*, another Breaking Bad - which I really struggled to get through, personally. However, I gave this a go. The episodes are hour-long and fairly fast-moving so it's ideal for if you have a short attention span! The story line is great and I found myself hooked in the first episode.<br/><br/>Initially, I found it a bit odd seeing Jason Bateman in a serious role, as I'd only ever seen him in comedy films! However, his character is fantastic and fits well with the role. His character is genius, sly and cunning but a good old family man. Dark and dramatic, but with a great pace and interesting events in each episode. <br/><br/>Bring on Season 2! From first impressions it's clear that Ozark is an attempt to fill the void left by Breaking Bad. A decent hard working family man unwittingly drawn into a world of drugs, murder and money laundering. As enjoyable as the show is it never quite manages to get the mix of dark humour an drama that Vince Gilligan did so well in Breaking Bad. I've never been to Ozark it looks stunning but this show does no favours to it's residents, none of them are very pleasant from redneck drug dealers to bent cops If I was from there I would feel somewhat offended. 8/10 A fantastic show. So much tense and character development in each episode. You really start to connect to the characters extremely early one even if all of them are a bunch of cheaters, liars and mean folks. Still the way they are written and presented by the actors make them appealing because as flawed as they are they still have a heat somewhere and this makes them extremely human and realistic. The perfect show the binge watch because once an episode is finished you are extremely curious how it continues, what other secrets get revealed and how the characters further develop. Jason Bateman was never better and I would have never pictured him in such a dark and serious role but he mastered it wonderfully and really needs to get more roles like that. Excellent and inspired casting. Also his direction skills were fabulous but that is a big plus the show had anyway, a pitch perfect direction from all of those who were on the directors chair. Laura Linney was also wonderful. She reminded me somehow on her character in "Mystic River" only that her performance on that show was even greater. A very unpredictable woman, perfectly portrayed but one of the most unpredictable actresses working today. Another perfect casting clue. The kids were great and especially for Sofia Hublitz I can foresee a good career. Same goes to Julia Garner who should be up for many supporting actress awards. Peter Mullan was fantastic and gave a very disturbing and frightening performance. My favorite of the supporting cast however was Marc Menchaca who managed to go so much beyond the redneck stereotype but constantly playing with that. Awesome. Perfect writing, casting and soundtrack. I really hope there will be another season. They still could tell so much more of the fate of the family and I really would love to sink into it once again. I mean, it's not like you don't see a lot of TV shows and movies related with drugs and family problems, but Ozark have a great casting. I mean almost every character is well developed and the performers look so natural when they are acting, they fit so well in the scenario that look almost real. And I think the setting/place the show is recorded have a great impact in the success of Ozark in the first season. My only complain is that probably the producers should have chosen another actor for the character of Jacob Snell. Hell, I know the purpose of look like a "redneck or a farmer" but man, Peter Mullan looks like a Chuck Norris from Missouri and I don't feel intimidated and tensed up at any moment when he was speaking, quite the opposite with Esai Morales and Camino Del Rio. It's a shame the producers decide to put an end to his character so early in the show. Hope the producers find a way to success with these show in a second or third season and don't fall miserably in the attempt, like Netflix do with Bloodline. Give it a try, if you like the shows with good and well developed characters. Don't come looking for a lot of blood, shootings and things like that. Just finished binge watching season 1 ...Think this is as good or better than Breaking Bad.. If you watch the first episode you are hooked....Going to watch it again, and can't wait for season 2 Bateman is brilliant. The last episode sets up for an explosive 2nd season..Netflix is putting cable to shame. After the first episode I was hooked, Jason Bateman absolutely steals the show with his performance and as the show progresses you start to see other characters absolutely master their roles. Season 1 was awesome, I did not like season 2 as much but it was still good. This gave me a small expectation for season 3 and man was I blown away. This show doesn't fail to knock you off your feet with plot twists and dark turns. You see so much character development and what money and power does to people. Especially when Wendy's brother joins the show, his character was played perfectly. I would tell every person to watch this show if I could. I can not wait for season 4 Introducing Wendy's brother Ben into the series in season 3 was a mistake.
I hate every scene he is in and would FF through his scenes but I don't want to miss anything that could be important especially since I love every scene Ruth is in and since Ben is now Ruth's love interest I have to put up with him.
Ruth is without question the heart and soul of Ozark. Without her Ozark goes down the chute but Ben needs to go. I like the series but seriously how can someone who launder the money can be so full of buffoonery when it comes to run the business or to trust the people ? I mean even the dumbEst person in the world can be more intelligent than Marty who has no brain at all.<br/><br/>It was the other characters who were just controlling the $h!t that has been spread by MARTY !! Truly one of the best tv shows I've ever seen. Despite how interesting the story and its events are, the production is very good. The location as well makes it seem like a very good place to start a new life. On the other hand, I love the dark colors that showed that the Byrdes were throughout the whole show scared and afraid of not pleasing the Mexicans. I really do hope the ratings on this climb. Season 2 in my opinion has turnt this show into a little gem. I never right reviews but with this I just had to. Amazing Surprising to see Jason Bateman be in a drama, especially one as tense as this. There was good use of the characters with plenty of development and interest the whole way through. You learn to love this family and hope for the best even though you know they are breaking the law. Every episode presents quality drama. It will be exciting to see what happens in the next season. Keep it up Jason. Once I've seen the first episode and before have read any review the first thing came into my mind was that this series has "The Breaking Bad" vibes. Besides the thrilling story and wasting no time on pointless scenes the music is really wonderful it Rhythms with the events. A better than average moody nail-biter, with talented actors mostly up to the task. The downsides are roughly the same as with Breaking Bad, which Ozark's plot models so closely that you have to wonder: are white middle-class American families mega-bummed that they're missing out on drug trafficking action? Both shows roll with sloppy handling of major plot points in order to orchestrate set pieces that, for their fans, probably define each series. That puts a heavy onus of belief suspension on viewers who're not quite besotted with the goings on (thus the wildly divergent reviews here). But if dark and brooding are your taste, you could do far far worse.<br/><br/>The good stuff: Bateman and Linney, shot for maximum middle-age ravages, artfully avoid the clich√É¬©s of long term, living dead marriages, swinging through their roles as through a cave with a very dim lantern. A big problem with many of these shows (Breaking Bad a principle case) is that the A-Z character arc is not really supportable in episodic TV. The Good Wife understood how slowly evolution had to occur to not only ring true but remain effective. Ozark seems to be giving its leads the necessary rope. The mood and look is nearly always post-dawn with no sleep, and the creators have mined an area of the country mostly unseen on the tube and, until recently, in movies. The pace is nimble - there are a few early shocks, but the producers are generally aces at making somnambulism compelling and believable in a high-functioning criminal entrepreneur. Carnage to follow.<br/><br/>The weak stuff: The actress playing Ruth is absolutely better than adequate, but the role needs genius to side-step the implausibility of a teenage woman amassing power in her circumstances (swapping roles with the actress playing Bateman's daughter might have worked). The location is more upstate New York than central/southern Missouri, and lacks the gut-bucket rawness of impoverished lives subsisting alongside some of the most challenging natural environment in the U.S. (my guess is it's filmed in Canada, with some clips from the Ozarks dropped in). <br/><br/>One reviewer mocked the performers' accents. I spose he could be a linguistic expert, but I spent half my life in Missouri and have never encountered a place with more variance in tone and twang (or toxic racism). That lack of consistency seems approximately accurate with this moment in the redneck diaspora. Ditto that the sole intellectual exertion prominent in the local characters is spent on insults and gleeful, nihilistic prognosticating.<br/><br/>Not a bad time investment, though, and could have a long term payoff. The director and actors did not take the care needed to convey The Ozarks, especially the way southern Missourians actually sound when they speak. What is used in this show is the entertainment business's idea of what southern "poor whites" sound like when they speak. "Ha" for "high", "ma" for "my" and so on. Parts of Missouri have very distinct dialects but they don't sound like the voices in this show. It wouldn't be so bad if we didn't have to hear the same phony accent from a main character, Ruth, over and over. The plots might or might not make the show interesting to watch but the show has been lazily researched, produced, directed and acted. If you have only one dollar and you spend it on something you don't really want or need it won't be available when you want to buy something you do really want or need. Same thing with time, except that time is more important than money. That's why I quit this show after the third episode. One of the best TV crime, drama, thriller's since Breaking Bad. If you were a fan of BB then you will definitely love Ozark IEO (In everybody's opinion!) it's certainly worth your time. The narrative will keep you hooked. The thrilling drama continuously twists, turns and evolves to immensity! There are also some great dark humorous moments to ease your grip. I did not watch shows like this (dealing with family, ordinary people sinking into crime) - Breaking Bad comes to mind as something what is probably similar. And I just don't need to spend hundreds of hours on something depressive, what this serial in first 10 episodes is. I watched 2x The Sopranos, but that's simply another league. Much more coherent, way better story, acting, dialogues. Although I did not like last season. Sorry for this little off topic, but it is my only reference to compare. So, first episode was far from perfect, but was made very well to attract viewers (what is probably best skill of USA TV show authors). Acting is OK, although I don't see Bateman as right choice for some financial math genius. Weak things showed up too in EP1 - marriage picture was shallow if not unreal, for instance. Then they moved with all that money in unknown. Half of next 2 episodes was how Marty skillfully convinces people to do ... what ? Stupid investments, with silly arguments. There were new characters introduced, was lot of actions, things without sense, and really no place in 1 review to even mention worse ones. I started to lose interest, and almost stopped watching. Then came episode 8, what was way better, and actually best in first 10 (maybe 10 is all what will be from ..) - it was actually jump back some 9 years, about how Marty and Del met, how Marty was hooked in money laundry. Episodes 9 and 10 were better than first 7. Season finale was actually better than I expected. Some not bad twists for change. The characters are almost all disgusting - I don't know better word. Even kids. Maybe Charlotte is someone who is most normal here. Rachel was rare likable character, and I think that she was only one who did only real smart thing is whole serial (in EP10). Most scary was indeed Darlene - that was case of excellent casting and make up. But even she did one right thing (bad motivation though). Will be more seasons ? I guess that yes. However, I don't expect that this will be better. Plus, if I will watch it, I will never go to visit USA :-) People really like this show, watched only 30 minutes of season 3. Watching mass murder up and close, how is this entertainment? Man what bad karma you can bring upon yourself creating such filth. The mental problem brother can be a good enforcer and muscle man. However, the show made him a stupid man. This is awful. They should have done a better job. I didn't see the load of cash in the show, no explosive, no mass gun. They did this solely to save money. Darlene is the only character that rocks. Martin did a bad job. When he said someone is "untouchable", he needs to enforce the red line.
People who don't enforce the red line is O.....Boomer It went way downhill after they introduced Ben. It was going well but the writers ran out of ideas.<br/><br/>It's a joke and a waste of time. Watchable but feeds into many stereotypes. The continued use of tone, context and verbage of the word "Mexican" by the Snells who are portrayed as "rednecks" I would believe could be very offensive to Mexicans. But then again, they are not banking on having a large Mexican audience I am sure. The privilege, entitlement, arrogance and "I can get anything I want to done" attitude and tendencies by many Caucasians is on full display in this series. Even middle class Caucasians and hillbillies can outsmart, muscle and defend against the 2nd largest Mexican drug cartel. Unrealistic but feeds into the arrogance, ego and way of thinking by many of white America who can't help themselves in thinking all are inferior to themselves. Watchable but the stereotypes and unrealism persistent in the series is BS. Love the show, but I'm so glad that Helen was written off. Not sure how much more of her and Wendy's horrendous outfits I could have taken. Now, I just have to put up with 1. These days it seems "art" is more about slapping you in the face with blunt rubbish that tries to shock you, does your thinking for you bust mostly, distracts you from the lack of talent on show.<br/><br/>Bateman is as weak as piss. They're horrible folks this I don't care about them. Nor should you. Ozark is fine. It's nothing more than that. It wants to be clever and gritty like breaking bad, and to have the red knecky charm of justified, but the sad reality is that it is neither of those things. It is all plot with no substance. There's no point where you ask yourself "why is it interesting that these things are happening?". Instead, the shows philosophy is the more basic "here is a bunch of stuff that happens". The creators hope that if they make the production slick enough then we'll be strung along despite it all being pretty meaningless. For me, I'm sure that I would have fallen for Ozark had I not seen other better shows, like Breaking Bad, or The Sopranos, which exemplify how serious TV can be as an art form, but I have seen those shows, so now I can't look at Ozark without rolling my eyes.<br/><br/>Furthermore, I find the visuals depressing and monotonous. Why is everything blue and dark in Missouri even when it's sunny? ...Because they took a basic visual metaphor and applied it to 30 hours of television without thinking and without variation, that's why.<br/><br/>Having said that, Jason Bateman and Laura Linney do some fine acting, but for me it's just not enough to keep me interested. Sorry. I'm in season 3 at the moment and since season 2 it's been so damn predictable.
My wife watched ahead and I was able to guess the entire episode!<br/><br/>Season 1 seems so slow even though there's a-lot happening, this has to be due to the dull characters and acting.<br/><br/>The characters are all flat then flip flop to psychotic and back to flat again.<br/><br/>They're trying so desperately to be breaking bad.. instead it's just a Bateman vanity production. I demand a lot of my entertainment. If I have a prejudice I like smart people. I like smart heroes and smart villains. The best Bond movies had smart villains. Edward Fox in "Day of the Jackal" was probably the smartest villain ever. I don't like dumb people. I don't like emotionally unstable people. But more later.
Ozark shows the clash of two cultures. Ultra smooth talking couple from Chicago are forced to move to the Ozarks to launder drug money. They run smack-dab into another culture, a slower culture where tradition and relations are honored above pure financial gain. But this "hillbilly" culture is undergoing change as well. It can not stop the encroachment of modernity into their lives.
Ozark is peppered with surprises and fine acting. Listen to how language defines everyone's station. How superiors talk to subordinates, how equals talk to each other, how those who think they know talk to people who think they don't know.
Justin Bateman and wife Laura Linney always have an answer, a deception, a exaggerated hope to keep the wolves at bay. And they always have a scheme to either climb higher or...escape.
The best scene involves a drone. The funniest scene is the worst proposal of marriage since Laurence Olivier proposed to Joan Fontaine in "Rebecca."
The star of the show is...the cell phone. Nearly everyone has one and they are constantly using it - mostly in ploys to save their lives.
Season 3 spends way too much time on an emotionally unstable character. The final episode slows down when it should be speeding up. Ozark ultimately fails my two tests. 1) If I were a character how would I handle things. For me, simple. Take the freeking money and run. But a family of four (among them a constantly rebellious teenage daughter) would find that difficult. 2) Will I see it again? Probably not...I hate cell phones. I love Ozark but I really can't stand Tom Pelphrey's acting. I think he was a miscast and wasn't right for the part. His acting wasn't consistent, wasn't believable ... if anything his acting was annoying and brought down the quality of the show. Anytime he was on, we wanted to fast forward and/or stop the show and not watch it. All the other actors, everyone of them are fantastic ... but Ben Davis's role played by Tom Pelphrey is a truly disappointing. Hope he won't be in future seasons or episodes. I am a breaking bad fan, for me I am on episode 6 of series 1, this is a cheap copy with a GAY romance, just feeling sick in the stomach watching it. I am a breaking bad fan, for me I am on episode 6 of series 1, this is a cheap copy with a GAY romance, just feeling sick in the stomach watching it. This is basically a parallel version of Breaking Bad. Great show and full of suspense. Please give her a house already!!! √∞≈∏Àú¬≠
Ruth definitely steals the show but I want her situation to improve. Give her a house, and give her a community please. Fantastic show...every season gets better and better, and as for Ruth...Wow. Ozark is a must watch for any content watcher .
The initial impressions weren't good coz the plot was slow but that slowly changes .
The mere synopsis is enough to get you in :
A man and his family who are forced to launder money for a drug cartel .
Ozark is cleverly written , Season 1 was Great . Absolutely phenomenal with the pace and plot predicament.<br/><br/>Season 2 focused on side characters like the Langmores more than our leads which is why I found it a bit boring and sloppy or perhaps it was the plot progression which became so slow .
Coz I'm not here to watch a melodrama , Ozark season 2 is poorly written if you look at what season 1 and 3 denote .
In fact there wasn't any need for most of season 2 episodes .<br/><br/>Season 3 had a classic comeback and back on track as it focused on Greed and Politics .<br/><br/>Acting is class apart . Everybody , every F*8king character has played a significant role .
Specially Jason Bateman and Laura Linney .
You know there aren't many shows where each and every casting is spot on .
Ozark is a well directed , a heck of a show . Don't miss it . In my opinion best show on Netflix. The writing is superb !! I cant stress this enough!! so many twists and angles. Anything could happen. Show is dark blue .The cinematography is amazing and the soundtrack!! I love those moments in the show and there are plenty when they make you feel something evil about to happen. The thrill , the intensity . This is something new on TV. You have to see for yourself. Such good acting and writing and they haven't even invested in the Cartel,Mob story a lot . Especially if you're thirsty for Breaking Bad. You'll eat this right up.<br/><br/>It's hard not to compare Ozark to Breaking Bad so let me get that out the way. Ozark feels like the spinoff child of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul.<br/><br/>Walter White + Saul Goodman = Marty Byrde. First of all i would like to say that this series is more in the same line as Breaking Bad. Except that in Breaking Bad, the family as a whole is not involved in the illegal business where here, the family as a whole gets involved.<br/><br/>Season 1 starts off as about an Accountant getting involved with a South American Drug Cartel's money laundering and loses his partner as the partner was skimming money from the cartel. Somehow Marty (played by Jason Bateman) convinces the cartel contact, Del, that he can do a better job if he moves to Ozark from Chicago. Del since he had a great impression about the skills of Marty, he gives a chance to Marty to prove himself right.<br/><br/>Marty with his family moves to Ozark and starts putting in place his idea and tries to get things going on. Meanwhile Marty tries to convince his family that this is for their good and in this process the 2 kids gets to know what Marty has been doing.<br/><br/>Jason Bateman and Laura Linney have done a great job of showing a close knit family and palyed their part of showing how feared they are in trying out a imaginary idea that Marty told Del, which was actually just to not get killed. The characters who come up as Ozark locals have also drawn a great picture of how laid-back the place is. Especially Ruth (Julia Garner) and Buddy (Harris Yulin) characters are portrayed by the writer directors in such a way that we carry them around our mind even after the TV is switched off. The locality of Ozark where the story is short is a great place and adds to the country side flavor of the story. The twists and turns in the story is also very gripping and not very predictable.<br/><br/>At certain scenes the abckground music reminded of the music in The Dark Knight.<br/><br/>The character Ben (played by Tom Pelphrey) initially does not impress you. But once the story turns to make him the center of all events, the way Tom has played the role, makes you feel helpless about the situation. We the audience themselves start thinking what can be done to save the day. And we will finally want to have done something different than what happens but also realize there was nothing else that could have been done for him. When Season 3 ends, you feel a heavy heart and do not feel like doing anything else for some time. As if we have gone through a family tragedy in our own family.<br/><br/>I am waiting impatiently for Season 4. Great TV drama. Didn't know what to expect when I began watching but the cross of story lines and character development is interesting and keeps one's attention. I'm not going to spoil anything, but with this show, more than any I remember watching, the viewer never really knows which characters are safe in terms of being written out of the show. Let me start off this review with my opinion of the acting min this series. Somehow, and I'm not sure how, the show runners and directors managed to get every one of these actors to buy in to their characters. I haven't seen such a compilation of outstanding performances in a very long time. I realize that acting awards are all about politics, and popularity, but if they weren't Bateman, Linney, Garner, Emery and McTeer would have a lock on them.
The cinematography and soundtrack in this show were awesome. Every episode was extremely suspenseful. The relationships were believable, instead of forced in for the sake of politics. It was so refreshing to view a show that was all about the story line. The writing was great.
Give this show a try. You won't be disappointed.
It would be nice to see a fourth season, but that's not Netflixes way, so we'll have top see. This is one of the finest multi season series which keeps getting better and better. Storyline doesn't get boring and production team keeps it simple - just deliver brilliance with every season. A must watch if you can find time!!! Some reviewers have commented that they didn't like Season 3 because it was "Wendy-centric." Well, that is just the story arc, it moves from focusing on Marty and Ruth to having Wendy, Helen Pierce, and Ruth be the focal point of various episodes in Season 3. The women move to the forefront. Deal with it or watch something else. This series moves along at a rapid clip, keeps you interested, and comes up with new angles all the time. It's one of the best TV series on at the moment. The ending of Season 3 is shocking, to say the least! To be clear, none of the characters are really likable, although some have their moments. (Having said that, my favorite character was Buddy!) But that's OK. This is not a show where good people are pitted against bad people; this is a show where bad people are pitted against badder people, who are working for even badder people, and so on. Prepare to be shocked, disgusted, horrified, and amused, often at the same time. We recently binged the first 3 seasons of Ozark and I must say Jason Bateman outdid himself!! Season 1 hardly compared to the twists and turns of the next two seasons. The character development is superb and you really never know what to expect. I love a story that leaves you breathless waiting for the next episode and believe me, Season 4 can't get here fast enough!! Kudos to the whole cast on superb acting!! Good God.. this show managed to ruin every other show for me; every aspect of it is amazing: the writing, acting, setting, and soundtrack. Every episode is masterfully crafted.. Definitely 10/10. It just gets better and better! Season 2 was brilliant, season 3 has surpassed that! The characters, the evolving storylines, the new characters, the acting! There isn't one character who doesn't have some intense story. It's brilliant! An intense, edge of seat watch which will have you saying "wTF" at the end of most episodes! The finale of season 2, brilliant! Season 3 though, oh wow! Can't wait for season 4 The story can be a little overwhelming at times. Just like breaking bad but less. The best part is the supreme effort from the actors. It's great. Can't wait for s4 Just finished season 3 and Ozark brought it again AS USUAL!!! This is a powerful thriller drama, certainly engaging. Its unique setting of the Ozark mountains brings beauty and deceptive calm to the simmering conflict of money laundering. Laura Linney gives a captivating performance, without which the show would be just another clich√É¬© of normal people caught up in outrageous criminal behaviour. While the show keeps your attention, it settles for too many stereotype characters (think Hillbillies and Mexican drug lords) and unnecessary, gratuitous graphic scenes (both sex and violence). The show could be stronger if it played to its strong hand of internal conflict: how far will personal drive to survive, and maybe even prosper, propel you? Ozark is a drug cartel movie, where the cartels are Mexicans by the group Niverios and Marty and Wendy byrdes are their money launderers, also helps them to open a legitimate business operation with the aim of laundering money through the companys. Marty was lucky not to be killed by Del, who at California killed Marty's business associates. Then the proposition from Marty led him and his family relocate to Ozark, a sub mini town, which has prospects of business growth.
Ozark is a violent movie,bad words spited out and full of substance. Well scripted and the actors are good, especially Ruth and of course Marty and Wendy byrde. I can't wait to watch the season 4, because at the tail end of the season 3, Ruth quit working for Marty and Wendy and joined Darlene the reckless and fearless woman who poisoned her husband and business partner all because she thought he is losing out and had the sense he wants to kill her. What will Jonah do to his mom, after hearing that she okayed the killing of her brother? And since Helen died at the end of the movie, what will be the faith of her daughter? A lot of things to think of.
Ozark has moral impacts also, everyone makes mistakes in life and Marty is not an exception, by agreeing to launder money for the cartel, and I believe it could be at the time his wife was not working, and he is not getting much money to improve the living status of his family. So is not good to let greed take over your characteristics as a person. Marty in the movie has a good sense of humour, and cool headed. He doesn't like troubles, devoted to a fault even when his wife Wendy seems to claim "I know it all" which cost her her brother's life. Is good as a family to understand reasons, and not to be enforcing or pasuasive, which the second mistake Wendy did by forcefully owning a second casino, which at the time was not needed. Every secret must one day leak, is a matter of time, and this movies teaches that.
In summary, this movies os dope, beautiful and captivated my instincts and approval to be watching even when I have other important things to do. One of the best shows ever made, waiting for next season, must watch for great story, acting, and screenplay My first thought was : Its just another breaking Bad but its feels actually way different.
Great acting pared with great writing. Keep it in guys. Every episode in the front has a play. Although some of the later episodes are too deliberate, they suddenly turn to daily trivia. I like this episode very much, so I added points. Finally, I went back to the story line and finished the story well. This serie is the whole package what I really like to see!! Ozark is one of the absolute best shows I've ever watched. It contains endless plots which is why the show LITERALLY keeps you on the edge of your seat.
From season 1 to 3 it just goes uphill, which is even better. Would 100% recommend watching! Just finished watching the whole of season 3 and wishing there was a season 4 to watch now. Well acted, nice character development and intro of a couple of new characters and angles in this season. Well worth the watch, awesome show. All the characters are so strong and amazing in their own way. Nicely made show! Awesome show. Keeps watcher interested throughout the whole series. Finished it in less than a week. I changed my rating to a 9 after this last season. Either they need to really take it up a notch or let's this season be the last. It's been a great show but I grew bored this past season. The wife and both were totally engaged into eyes glued to the screen well done thriller. The end of season 3's episode was a shocker. Didn't see it coming. Is there more to come or is it over. It left us hanging wondering what next. Where do they go from here? Everyone says it's like Breaking Bad, but I thought it was more like Justified. Down home crooks and the authorities always one step behind. The locals and the cartel seem smarter than the cops. The lady playing Ruth is outstanding. Every single episode is awesome! Nice plot and a good story! Really worth watching! A heavy-duty movie, I like it, I hope there is a sequel to make me more enjoyable. I love the story lines. they keep me riveted to the show. Julia Garner is a phenomenal actress as are Linney and Bateman BUT you'd think by now Hollywood would've come to the conclusion that casting Puerto Rican actors as Mexicans is inauthentic. There are a lot of Mexicans, I assure you, who have Netflix and are watching the show but when we hear these Puerto Rican actors speaking Spanish, it's fake. the accents are worlds apart.<br/><br/>It's like having a similar program in a Spanish speaking country and casting Australians to play Americans but they're speaking in an Australian accent.<br/><br/>The other part about is, it's just plain lazy. There are plenty of capable Mexican actors that can fill these roles. The problem with white Hollywood is they think we're all alike. They think the Argentian is to the Mexican what the Kenyan is to the Nigerian or Somalian to the Swahili.<br/><br/>Just because share the same language doesn't mean we share the same culture.<br/><br/>This is why I have to knock a star off. Other than that, I thoroughly enjoy the show. I just wish the producers and casting agents of this show would figure out the obvious. I have stuff I need to do and I want to do other things like play video games, but I just can't stop watching. This story defines how far a man can go when the only way to save his life and his family is to slip to the wrong paths. And so when these wrong paths become acceptable to survive.<br/><br/>The flow of story is really good and keeps the viewer on TV screen.<br/><br/>I'm not American, and I see many movies and series involving greed and corruption in the countryside of USA. Thus, taking these stories as examples, I started wondering if it's a good idea to visit such cities, once the stories played in metropolitan areas show a different situation, where the law has a stronger sense of justice, so admired outside US. The whole production is brilliant, I have never watched a series that makes you think oh no this argument will lead to this... And a marriage breaking up will have this effect. You can play out the domino effect in your mind everyone something goes wrong and that's a first for a series. Well done Jason, and to Tom Phelpreys acting, it was a masterclass. Interesting from the very first episode.
Many different characters which makes it hard to predict. Season 02 wasn't surprising and was a lil bit predictable. With some plot holes and quick major character developments.. season 3 was just OK for me. The worst part being the whole "Uncle Ben" angle, which I found totally annoying. Hope season 4 is better. I'm 3 episodes into Season 3, and while "everyone" says it really kicks into high gear - and it may - so far I'm finding it disappointing. A lot of the supporting cast characters from season 2 have, shall we say, moved on, and while one of the pleasures of the show during the first 2 seasons was seeing how the characters slowly over time got sucked down the rabbit hole and struggled, this season Wendy in particular has lost all perspective and she gets her way way too easily. This show is smart and interesting. Laura Linney, as usual, dominates the screen. I had never been a Bateman fan, but he is fantastic in Ozark. After 3 seasons, it is climbing up my {favorite shows ever list}. "The Wire" is still king of the hill, followed closely by "Breaking Bad" and the "Sopranos." But this show appears primed for a good 5 season run as well. Looking forward to it. Everything went very well, until the 3rd season. But it seems like season 3 did Paul Feig and Katie Dippold. It will be very disappointing if the female version of Breaking Bad turns into Gnostbusters 2016. Do i suggest u watch it... sure... but keep in mind it's nothing so uniqe/as amazing as many seem to review it and love the series for reasons i don't understnad...
it's not boring/horrible/... just to my opinion maybe a bit plain and missing somthing... some element somthing.... i can't put my finger on it but... just a bit generic i guess...
should u watch it sure... but if you'd ask me you've got better alternatives...<br/><br/>i'm not allways sure by how much to rate series/... i watched so....(i might update my rating later in such a case just ignore this part...)
and for full disclaimer i haven't finished watching i soped somwhere around the second or maybe third series so i can't say if it's getting better...<br/><br/><br/><br/>again not horrible but (the current 8.4) score definatly feels too much... Don't get me wrong - this is "Ozark's" strongest season yet. Laura Linney's talent towers here, a rare accomplishment amid a deeply talented cast. So it's too bad the nonstop vulgarity mars this fine work to the point where I cannot award more than eight stars. Janet McTeer's understated Helen Pierce gets the vulgar language mostly right. Julia Garner's Ruth Langmore is a bit over the top but, given the character, it isn't terribly far off the mark. Linney's Wendy Byrde is way too foul mouthed for the role. Dial it back in S4, please. I have watched and enjoyed many series with graphic violence, characters lacking a moral center, graphic sex scenes, etc., like Breaking Bad, Narcos, Sopranos. I was always sorry to some extent when these series ceased their yearly installment, even given their 'adult' content.<br/><br/>The Ozarks are an exception to this feeling. While well acted, scripted and engrossing (indeed I have watched all the installments), I feel like I need a bath after viewing this show. There is absolutely no redeeming character in this show. They are all rotten at their core, constantly scheming and undermining each other. The characters are not even fun to 'hate'<br/><br/>I desperately need a break from this show. I feel wasted after allowing myself to watch it. Can I be redeemed? Love this show!!! But why?? The Outsider too. Way too dark and unnecessary. Bateman is incredible but this is one decision that boggles my mind All it took was one scene and I was done. Good while it lasted. Now I know why it went to Netflix. Do we always need a gay scene? I watched Ozark because I don't have anything to watch and it was one of the popular titles here in IMDB at the time when season 1 was released. I was bored for about 2 episodes and decided to just give it a shot for a couple more episodes AND IT PAID OFF. Now it's one of the best shows I have ever watched and I think it's really underrated. It's sooooo good that I don't want a season to end. It gets better and better every season and you root for different characters in the span of one seaspn. It's unpredictable! I recommend you watch this if you just read through this lengthy comment. I know you won't regret it. just make it through the first 4 episodes and you'll be hooked. I really hate that they introduced Wendy's brother as a new character and love interest for Ruth.
Other than that Ozark is one of the finest series ever produced. This show is brilliantly written and casted. The story is simple yet thrilling. Dirty business of Cartel and money laundering by Marty Bryde is what this show is based on. Quite good but little bit slow sometimes. Best thing about this show is it leaves you at edge of the seat. Absolutely recommended if you fancy a watch...! Season 1:<br/><br/>A really intriguing show that kept me entertained the whole way through. The first episode was particularly great and set the tone right away. As the season went on, there were a few characters/storylines that dragged on a bit and weren't as interesting, but the overall story was great. I did not like the ending with Del's death, that felt like a cop out and took away from what would have been a great storyline in season 2. Jason Bateman was amazing and it was the perfect role for him and he killed it.<br/><br/>8.5/10<br/><br/>Season 2:<br/><br/>The story picked right where it left off at the end of season 1 and it only got better from there. I really liked most of the storylines/character arcs throughout the story (other than Darlene). I think the season ended pretty well too - the set up with the cartel vs. the KC mob could be pretty cool. I wish there was more info about the logistics of the money laundering/casino set up though, it was glossed over for the most part.<br/><br/>9/10 This show reminds me quite a bit of breaking bad; a dysfunctional family laundering drug money and making ridiculous choices. And I did not like breaking bad and all it's ridiculously cringy plot holes and unbelievability.<br/><br/>First off let me say that this show is far from perfect. The first thing I noticed is that they have a 20 year old actress, who looks like she's 30, playing the role of a 15 year old girl. That right there is a bad move. And the way that the character in the show is not consistent with the vocabulary of a 15 year old. I didn't buy it even for a second. Another thing is the little details the crew has looked over and missed; when Rachel call Marty with a new phone; it shows up on Marty's phone as 'Rachel'. How could that be if she's calling from an untraceable phone? Some scenes were filmed right, in one shot their arms are up in the air and the next they're down by their side, within a fraction of a second. The storyline is hard to believe, they just happen to buy 4 businesses like it's nothing and nobody talks to each other about it in the town. And about the businesses, Marty buys a strop club but is never actually there to run it. He leaves a 19 year old delinquent to take care of the operations when she has no experience in real life, only in crime. And even she is never at the club, so who's taking care of it? How is he washing this money? It showed him putting it in a drying machine but no real details on how he did any of it. Most of the characters in this show aren't likeable.<br/><br/>So to me this show is a lot like breaking bad because of how poorly executed it is. Attention to detail is what draws the line between a good tv show and a great one and this the latter. I hope season 2 is filmed better and given a little more realism than happenstance just to love the show along. The interpretation of art will vary from one person to another.<br/><br/>My perception of the project's engagement and creativity is what my reviews are based on.<br/><br/>For me, a movie/TV show is either going to be good or bad. A yes, I would recommend it to others or a no, don't waste your time.<br/><br/>In short, my reviews are just my opinion. I hope it helps you when deciding what to watch and what to avoid. So season 2 may be even better than season 1, although I knew what was going to happen several times throughout this season & I appreciate shows where they keep me guessing. For that reason I only gave it 9 stars.<br/><br/>My one complaint which is a complaint for MANY TV shows, is that I had to re-watch season 1 because there was so much time in between the two seasons, I couldn't remember what happened. Normally watching the last season's episode brings back the memories, but in this case it didn't.<br/><br/>Jason Bateman has turned into a superb actor, & who even knew he was such a talented director.<br/><br/>I have no idea where I know him from, but looking at his IMBD bio I haven't seen ANY of his TV shows in the last 25 years LOL<br/><br/>He & Julia Garner stole the show for me this season. EXCELLENT acting.<br/><br/>Skylar Gaertner had his moments too.<br/><br/>I can't wait for season 3 to come out, they literally killed off several characters which was surprising. Excellent Fabtastic, WOW!! One of the best if not the best tv series ever. I did compare it to Breaking Bad, I loved that too but this show is faster and action aplenty. The writers did a fantastic job and the actors are great. You have got to watching this thrilling joyride of emotion
Brilliant till the end Every episode of Ozark is like the last episode of Breaking Bad. You get psychologically yanked around then get wrapped in a neat package with a bow at the end which leaves you hungry for the next installment. Both seasons were of the same high quality and were satisfyingly entertaining. Certainly worthy of multiple viewings. Kudos to all involved.. Bingeworthy. Can't wait for season 3. Well done. Great characters. I love Jason Bateman but Laura Linney is fantastic in this. Great series to binge. Whole cast is amazing. I'm a big fan of Jason Bateman in a comic role so I resisted watching this for a long time, but finally acquiesced. JB brings his flavour to the show, despite its dark tone. Fantastic cast and storyline is not at all predictable. This a series I will keep watching. It's brutal, gritty, scattered with dark humour and full of suspenseful twists. An excellent cast combined with an original plot. It may have some parallels with Breaking Bad, as it intelligently examines the psychology and sociology that fuel crime, but it takes a very different direction. As the plot unfolds, the decisions made by characters serve to twist the threads of an intriguing story. Top notch cinematography. Brilliant acting from Jason Bateman and Laura Linney.<br/><br/>Conclusion: Edgy and Unique. Highly underrated Amazing Amazing Movie. Everything about this movie feels right. Ozark is phenomenal. It's a deep dive into the lives of a group of morally bankrupt, horrible people and the effects of their actions on their families. You will feel disgusted by them, but the show is so well written and acted that it becomes addicting.<br/><br/>The main theme is that their are consequences for one's actions. You do bad, you get bad. Simple, really, but so many people in this world have never learned this basic lesson. Ozark makes this abundantly clear, in a fascinating, complex, and yes unbelievable manner. Still, it's a hell of a ride. Went into this not really knowing what to expect.. I was hooked after the first episode! It's really well written , awesome characters, dark humor, and reminded me a bit of Fargo in the way the characters are and the situations they get into ..I loved it and can't wait for season 3. WOW. I LOVE THIS SHOW!<br/><br/>Lots of twists. Rapid fire suspense. I get tired of going through 20 Netflix shows to find something watchable, but this was worth it. GREAT! You constantly feel like nothing ever goes right for this family and you want them to get out of trouble but they continue to get deeper and deeper. It's dark, gloomy, and that makes great drama. Awesome characters and outstanding supporting characters makes this series a great one if you like serious dramas. I was so hooked after 1 st season,but then I watched second and was so disappointed. Slow,bored,nothing happens Set up is not so distant from that of Breaking Bad (as it portrays an otherwise normal family getting involved in drugs and crime) but actually the characters are quite different and this is a very good show in its own merit<br/><br/>This is a very entertaining series with superbly written dialogues, engaging characters which you will always have feelings towards and in a very believable set up<br/><br/>Acting by Jason Bateman (Marty) and Julia Garner (Ruth langmore) is outstanding I must say. The main FBI agent also pulls off a very unique character<br/><br/>Which makes it even better is that the second season keeps the same benefits but actually becomes much more addictive - cliff hangers and sudden changes with very high stakes on nearly every episode<br/><br/>Fans of Fargo or BBad should really have Ozark on their watchlist If Fargo and Breaking Bad had a baby, it would be called Ozark. Every thing in this serie is Wonderfull!
Watch plz!! Bateman gets all the accolades? Yes he does a nice job of standing around looking bewildered. Every scene he looks bewildered and he has a lot to be bewildered about! I believe the real acting award goes to the woman who plays Ruth Langmore. She is the star of the show . And Laura Linney is perfect for her role. A crime drama is not my genre but I enjoy it because of the children in the show. This gives the show a great twist and another level of interest and point of view. Very graphic but entertaining. Ozark will have you amused, bewildered, shocked and on the edge of your seat! It's so well filmed, directed and acted. Jason Bateman is a champion. Where do I start? Is it similar to Breaking Bad? Yes, it is.<br/><br/>But it's a different path. While the last episode suggests that he turns white while she turns dark.<br/><br/>The narrative is cohesive. I enjoy it a lot.<br/><br/>All the haters out there saying season 2 was weaker than the first. I agree. Still have my hopes up that it all will come together in season 3.<br/><br/>I loved Breaking Bad, The Night Of, HTGAWM (first season), and I like some good twists. But Ozark is well-written to have your fingernails pinched in your armrests.<br/><br/>So, give it a shot. Was never fan of a series from the very first episode. Now we are here... Love this show. Very binge worthy!! Can not wait till the next season. It is true I am a Justin Bateman fan, but putting out only ten per yer is torture. Not sure what else these four main actors are doing outside their work on Ozark, but I like watching the on-goings in the slower part of the country, in the Ozark, Missouri. Being a native from Los Angeles, I currently live in the less civilized part of Florida, so I can totally relate.<br/><br/>I am CURRENTLY a writer by trade. If you need more writers for more plots, I am your woman. You can find my work on AMAZON books under my name GWENDOLYN OLMSTED. I have seen each episode five times, and counting, so I can definitely come up woth more plots. <br/><br/>We want more Ozark shows! Very well shot... there are long scenes..It keeps you under preassure all the time.. act after act and if you miss a scene you wouldn't get the rest of the show. Can't wait for the next season. I dont have time to write a comprehensive review so let me just say that this series does so many things right.
From cinematography to storytelling. BUT most of all, character development. Probably, surprisingly, the best on Netflix right now.(2018-09).
Staggering good performance overall.
A must watch. One of the best shows of the year. Every episode from season 1 to season 2 feels like a noose getting tighter and tighter and tighter. Great acting from all cast every episode leaves you that feeling of the pit of your stomach that this will never end well. The storyline is so good in season 2. I could not stop watching it. It would be hard to rate this show any lower than 8. If you're a Bateman fan, you'll rate it a 10. He's very, very good in this. Most scenes are full of suspense and surprises. Insanely good casting, and a storyline that keeps you wanting more. Great insert , I thought all along the way something was familiar in this tale well looks like you did some Wolfe hunting , with the tall country kid that writes a great essay and gets into a big name collage early in life , next tale make him the star . 
Best,
Mark W Cassidy ( Penland and Westall ) I don't get it, why would you have a great series and end it with such a dull last episode. One user described this series as a home-run. It is, indeed, but with the bases loaded and 0 outs. Been watching crime movies and TV series for decades. When I watch a movie or series episode and I'm not fooling around with my mobile, playing with the dog, eating, or writing reminders to myself, I know I'm watching a masterful work. <br/><br/>As a crime drama, it is on a level with "I Was a Fugitive From a Chain Gang," "Godfather's, I and II," "Goodfellas," "Heat," and "New Jack City." Julia Garner you are a Genius actress simply the best actress I've ever seen. I love Jason Bateman and seen every single movie he's ever starred in, but Julia you are a master! Jason Bateman you have got to be All Hands Down, the best actor in the industry. Laura you just scare me, such a smart cold cold woman! Sophia you are the perfect bad ass brat! You girls have rocked your rolls as well, just perfect actresses. Skylar you are perfect Son of a Money Laundrer, I smile every time I watch you. Please Please add another season. Ozark the movie is brilliant, everything about it, I've followed it waiting for season 2. Please, OH Please say there will be more seasons. If you are going to show women's crotches so blatantly than at least balance it with naked men shots. No matter how often it's done it is still a harsh and demeaning image. From s1e1 to end keeps u watching and learning.<br/><br/>thank god seasons released at once it would drove me crazy to watch week to week I've really enjoyed this series, as it tries to balance a fast pace and detailed character building, with a witty script and suspenseful story-telling. I really enjoy this show. I have watched both seasons and find that the emphasis has changed from the male characters to the female characters in Season 2. When Darlene shoots Dell in the head she is making a statement that most people ( including her husband) might not agree with but she feels passionate about - she wants RESPECT. She and Jacob care more about their land and their autonomy than money. Marty and Wendy care about safety and money. The cartel ( in the form of its lawyer Helen) cares about money, power and reputation. This is not a good mix. Season two has Wendy taking on a much larger role as she attempts to get the casino going. And there are so many hands to either hold, grease or slap. Rachel comes back as a rat, but cannot take the intense pressure the FBI agent is putting on her. Ruth has her Dad Cade back in the fold only to find that he does not share her dream of a house with rooms for all , Cousin Wyatt going to college and continuing to work for Marty Byrde. He would rather steal than work. In fact it becomes clear he would rather do anything than work and he doesn't mind messing up Wyatt's future along the way. Ruth puts up with a lot Season 2 - being tortured, threatened and finally having to admit that she killed Wyatt's Dad. She seems to be the only Langmore with a brain and a way to see the big picture. Maybe only the Langmore men are cursed. Charlotte Byrde on the other hand is becoming more and more distraught by the constant state of fear and her parents blatant hypocrisy. She turns to Wyatt and drugs ( like the Langmore clan is so safe to hang with). She is unpredictable and not very good in the keeping one's mouth shut area. She assumes Wyatt knows more than he does about everything, not realizing Ruth knows how to keep things quiet except to good ole Dad. And Helen - the cartel lawyer - so confident, effective and just a bit cruel. Darlene I saved for last as she has been the biggest source of conflict. She never wanted to do business with the cartel, but she has to. She loves her land and bam - that is where the casino/ resort/ mall is going. She and Jacob have no children, and now that she wants a child everyone is getting in her way - the local government who have to check and vet her home and Jacob who tries to put her off with s 12 year old. She feels that she is not being taken seriously and she is right. To solve this problem though she makes a lot of bad choices starting with killing Dell. El episodio 4 de la temporada 4 filmada en total oscuridad o en penumbras Ya ni la chingan We all know Bateman is a terrific performer but the rest of the cast does equally great. Writing is solid but wouldn't call it air tight. In mid of season two the show tries to make you care for some characters you don't really care about and maybe this worked for other viewers but not for me. Soundtrack and background score is well knit and goes well with the tone. What I love about this show is they try to give an arc to each character no matter how insignificant you think they are. Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't.<br/><br/>Give it a try. Watch an entire season before judging it. Not just the big parts. I'm sorry this review is too short. Get your act together and post the entire cast. Even the starts. Post the entire case. Post the entire case. Post the entire case. Post the entire case. Post the entire case. Post the entire case. Post the entire case. Post the entire case. Post the entire case. Post the entire case. Post the entire case. 
Long enough yet? Love this show. Great cast great acting great story. This is a must see. Netflix need to try keep this going. I want more. I am a huge fan of Jason Bateman and always have been. From Horrible Bosses to other projects he has directed like Family Fang, it is very clear that he is very smart and very witty. Bateman directed a number of episodes and Ozark feels like other movies he has directed. He does not play a comedic character, instead playing a very boring accountant, but he does still retain his dry humor. Bateman's character Marty Byrde always has to come up with inventive ways of how to get out of impossible situations. Byrde uses his words and his persuasive ways to convince people of an overarching narrative he crafts in his head to prolong his life. In the middle of the season after all of the crazy stories Marty Byrde spins in order to protect himself and his family, the story did lag. In the earlier episodes, the crime family the Langmores are introduced, but as the story goes on good and bad things happen in the way they are used. Julia Garner is amazing as Ruth Langmore; a conniving, manipulative, and ruthless young criminal. Ruth is a highlight of the show, but for some reason, the show does not spend enough time with her during the middle of the season. Instead, another crime family is being set up which does prove interesting, but I would have liked to see her family used more. There are a lot of good and bad things about the Langmores, but they are a very colorful, if not horrible family. There is a wide variety of different people represented in the show and all are apt descriptions people who live in the Midwest. Byrde uses the inhabitants of the Ozarks for his own personal gain to launder money for the cartel and it is very interesting to see him use other characters to help him. I did not necessarily love the first season, but there is a lot of potential for better seasons. The writers are clearly setting up certain events for Season 2 and the last two episodes of the show really show the story pick up and what could be in store for the future. I definitely recommend it! Jason Bateman and the whole cast is excellent, but there are some really ridiculous subplots/story lines. A relatively tidy ending leading into the next season. Don't know if I'll watch it. Apart from the common man who faces uncommon circumstances and the great amount of money he finds in his hands, cartel etc., this is not "Breaking Bad". There are no techniques of shooting, photography and music as seen in "Breaking Bad". This last one had a whole other class, it was much more plausible and detailed and not only in the filming. Ozark is a mixture of "Breaking Bad" and "Fargo", but less of them in every respect.<br/><br/>It's bad? No. It is certainly watchable, but also boring at times. Photography it's dull, too dark. Anyway, I watched the first season without problems, apart from a single useless episode (8), but, please, don't compare it to those mentioned above, as it is not at their level at all.<br/><br/>7/10 to me. The idea is good, the actors are great but the rest is not so good.
As of December 2017 this show is rated 8.4 with many of 10. I do not understand this because this show lacks a lot of things, it is a constant run to a final destination that, we will find out, is not final!
I suspect is inspired by some real facts and events, this is good and informative. I like that the show goes against the political movement of the moment and is anchor in reality but seems very unlikely that a 'family man involved with drug money' can have the time and energy to do all that things. Very unlikely! <br/><br/>I struggled to see all episodes, again, the actors are great so I was hopping for a grand finale or something similar but no, the final is exactly as the rest of the episodes, dull and running to a destination that is not there. The problem with this type of strategy is that the public will be disappointed because makes impossible any end of the story or conclusion. Yes, the main character is smart, but how smart you can be until somebody else will outsmart you?
I suspect the writers can do only one thing and one thing only. If it will go with the same peace in the second season then will become apparent how boring it is. There is no desire to see the next episode or to continue, I hope it will end with this one.
Related to the characters: the wife is smart and dumb in the same time, sometimes hard to believe but we can buy it. On the other hand the daughter is the dumbest of all and in some moments the writers are trying to make us to relate with some of her drama - hard to do.
Also it is an FBI plot, but again is a not very smart one and cannot believe that FBI lacks a proper management structure. And why a gay FBI agent? What is the drama here? What is the point to be made? Related to nudity and explicit scenes -> I had the impression that are more gay "action" scenes than any other ones, none are designed to impress you, simple boring ones - gay or non-gay, all are bored, why? Because are unnatural, implausible and lacks artistic value. <br/><br/>Do not loose time with this one, this is a case when good actors and acting cannot save a bad script with a lot of unbelievable and ridiculous situations. When did Jason Bateman become such a good actor? And director? This show transplants a "Breaking Bad-ish" plot from the desert Southwest to the green Midwest, and it's great. The parallels with that show are many, except there's less overall initial innocence, and the kids find out the truth far faster. It stars Bateman, Laura Linney and a solid supporting cast. It's extremely well-written, and drips with regional accuracy, showing us the seamy underside of southern Missouri drug crime, mixed with the crisis-a-minute foibles of a displaced suburban family. One season made so far, and the show got green-lit for a 2nd. It's tense, brittle, darkly funny in a desperate way, bleakly emotional and overbrimming with class consciousness.<br/><br/>Bateman sheds his typically comic skin and goes dark, cool, plotting, cynical, icy, playing Marty Byrde, a calculating money manager from the Chicago suburbs who gets in over his head as a money launderer for a Mexican drug cartel, fronted by Esai Morales as the coldly homicidal Camino Del Rio. Linney is excellent as always, as Marty's wife Wendy, a mom trying to grasp at fraying threads of family identity, and hold everything together. Two young actors, Sofia Hublitz and Skylar Gaetner, are terrific as their frantic, frightened, confused kids, teen Charlotte and tween Jonah.<br/><br/>When things go sideways with the drug gang in Chicago, Marty barely convinces Morales to let him relocate to the Ozarks of Missouri, where he promises that the lakefront brims with under-managed small businesses and real estate parcels, terrain ripe as fronts for laundering activity. The family has 48 hours to split Chicago and a week to set up credible laundering operations. The kids are crudely uprooted, and circumstances in the Ozarks both freak them out and force them to grow up far too quickly. They intermix with a clan of trailer-dwelling locals, with mixed results, at first being sized up as easy marks, foolish city folk ripe for exploiting, but then the locals see how smart a business analyst Marty really is, and they begin to realign themselves in partnership with him. Julia Garner plays a 19-year-old sharpie, Ruth Langmore, with sly survivalism. She rules the Langmore compound of two adult male relatives and two younger male cousins; nobody screws with Ruth, and don't you dare eat her last can of Pringles. She comes to appreciate the opportunities Marty represents faster than anyone else.<br/><br/>Within a couple of weeks, he has his hands on the tillers of multiple area businesses: marina/bar, strip club, real estate agency, church, funeral home, and has drawn the attention of the local sheriff more than once. The stakes rise geometrically as Marty enters a three-way partnership with the Mexico cartel and the Snells, Jacob and Lisa, an infamous, and powerful, regional clan who control the region's heroin trade, and who have understandings with local law enforcement. The Byrdes gain an unexpected and unusual ally in Mr. Buddy Dyker (Harris Yulin), the terminally ill man who sells his lakefront home to them in exchange for the right to live out his remaining days in the basement of the house. He moves from creepy to clever to vital. Jason Harner and McKinley Belcher play a pair of obsessive FBI agents intent on nailing Marty and his Mexican bosses, and not too troubled by their unethical methodology.<br/><br/>Something occurs to me about "Ozark." That part of the country has increasingly come under writers' lenses, in the same way the New York-New Jersey Italian American experience did earlier. A dramatic test bed for crime stories. The novels of Daniel Woodrell, especially, draw some scary, desperate Ozark hills portraits, and do so with veritas, because he grew up down there and still lives in that region. This show hits the right visual and social notes: turkey vultures pinwheel languidly overhead, while dirty deeds get done dirt cheap down below, with particular emphasis on the rigging of dockside electrical junction boxes for the purposes of seemingly accidental electrocutions. All of this is set against a blue-green vista of remote lakeland life, both naturally beautiful and socially poisonous. Marty Byrde jumps from crisis to crisis, using his raw intelligence to feverishly protect his family from the dangers he himself exposed them to. It's wicked, cruel, sly, funny, dark and beguiling stuff. Great cast and performance, good camera,and that is it.<br/><br/>They just took the recipe and cooked it. I know ,there are many incapable of cooking anything but those are not calling themselves Chefs.<br/><br/>Same here, TV show that spans last decade of Crime/Mystery/Thriller TV genre..so you can remember some old originals.<br/><br/>Rather check for new episodes of your favorite sitcom Heard a lot of great things about this show, so I started with high expectations. The first episode was pretty good. Great settings, interesting dialogue, nice action. The Mexican dude was pretty cool. Usually when I like a first episode, it turns out to be a great series for me. Ozark however may the first series where this is not the case. The whole lake setting just doesn't work for me. Nothing really happens there and the locals are not very interesting either. There are way too many dumb, boring, uninteresting characters, getting too much scenes about nothing. Then there is too much gay men crap no one really wants to see either. I am currently half season and I am really struggling to keep watching. I will finish it, since it is only 5 more episodes, but so far this really isn't what I was hoping or expecting. I need not go into detail; other than to say "Ozark" was perfectly cast, with a story one will want' to watch all episodes non-stop. Every bit as good of a show, (with less humor) as "Breaking Bad". Ten Stars in all categories. Can't wait for Season 2. Like a book you can't put down until the ending; excellent story and presentation by Netflix, Kudos!!! Proving to be as great a director as he is an actor. Perhaps I'm biased due to long time obsession with Laura, but I thought it was tremendously well made in that all of the scenarios are over the top and egregious, and if it had not been put together so meticulously or acted so well, it would have all come apart. I've enjoyed watching Bateman grow as an actor over the years and always suspected he has a touch of the OCD. It really shows through in Ozark, but in a good way, and I hope to see much more of this show and his work in the future. I hope the team gets nominated for something this year. If you loved Breaking Bad, definitely this is the series you should embark on watching till you finish the season in the blink of an eye... With scenario well set, series staff does amazing job to complete this non-stop thriller, Jason Bateman obviously at his best putting his hands on a new generation.. I am already waiting for the next season and i cant really wait for it...<br/><br/>A must watch...<br/><br/>9/10 I can not recommend enough this show. Its just amazing writing, acting, a roller coaster that never stops. Its so well knitted that you get a rush of adrenaline after every episode. A real look to a dark side of business. Bateman just blew my mind in this one. i gave it 10/10 because definitely is one of the best shows i have seen next to Six Feet Under and Hannibal. And for some reason it feels like the perfect mix of these two. I cant wait for next season. This is the best thriller series I have ever watched! The characters are very believable. Wonderful acting. Jason's portrayal of Marty Byrd is spot on.....deep thinker. Delighted to see the full extent of his ability. Laura, always the consummate professional. And Julie blew me away. Leaves a person wanting more. First off I will say that this show is pretty dumb. The cast do a great job with whatever the heck is going on in this alternate reality. These people are like no humans I've ever encountered. I haven't seen the whole season yet. I chose to click "spoilers" because here is my theory, and I could be right...aliens decided to make a "breaking bad" like show and tricked Jason Batemen and Laura Linney and all the rest of the cast to be in this dumb show. Then in the last episode an alien version of Ashton Kutcher jumps out and screams "You've all been Ozarked!" It's fun to watch This series kind of takes me back to the "Breaking Bad" days, but on a kind of a smaller scale. Of course, we don't know how the series will evolve in the upcoming seasons. This is the kind of story in which you cannot predict what will happen, making you eager for more, and more. Finished the first season in two days. Really recommend it. Netflix and Jason Bateman did their job pretty slick. I'm happy to say there is now a show that can fill the empty void I was left with after breaking bad ended. Watched the entire season in one day and not by choice. I couldn't help it. I was glued to my television. The writing is brilliant, and the performances are incredibly raw and real. Can not wait for the 2nd season. Most of the time the story produces scenes which invoke fear - the kind that slowly builds and sometimes stalls but just for a little bit. Laced in between are some brilliant scenes between Laura Linney and Jason Bateman. I've also thought both actors were really talented, particularly Linney. But watching their exchanges, and their interactions with their children, get's better as the story progresses brings their talent to a whole new level. One of the best series' i've ever watched, makes it into my top 3 list. At moments it has that quirkiness and unexpectedness and that makes you really like this. The characters are very interesting. Stunning views, that blue atmosphere, it's the perfect dark drama series. Looking forward to what season 2 will bring us. I liked the acting and the story as a whole. Great actors. However, there is serious Jewish propaganda going on here, I mean homosexuality, promiscuity, anti religious (other than Judaism), anti family (for goyim), interracial marriages (for goyim), as well as a demonstration of Jewish supremacy and domination of the banking system. I highly doubt you would allow this comment to show up. It starts of well enough and builds up to a great end. Unfortunately for the last episode the writers gave up. Pathetic ending to what could have been a Great ENDING and a continuation of Ozark. This unfortunately happens to many episodes like Mad Men to take an example. Just to finish the episodes or to kill the program they do not care. Sad. What keeps this show from an 8 or 9 is Bateman as the lead in this series. He is flat and doesn't have the charisma or screen presence like Brad Pitt or Matt Damon to pull off the lead character here. That said, the plot is good, sometimes too much slow dialogue. But there is good potential for second season if there are more plot lines tying in the drug cartel. Acting is fantastic, Laura Linney is A list for sure. (I just hope she doesn't get into the ego politics like Streep and Clooney and lose credibility). Bateman would be fine as a secondary character and his directing skills look good. The other characters are fascinating and all well acted. I wasn't sure what to expect from Jason Bateman in this show but I was extremely pleasantly surprised once I started watching. There are not many shows I can watch and be kept on the edge of my seat almost the whole time, but Ozark definitely did that for me. The intensity is awesome. The acting is top notch, in my opinion. All in all a great show that I am now extremely excited to continue watching. Season two, where you at? It's hard to believe Jason Bateman Directed as well as starred in Ozark. It's dark, humorous but does lag a little during the middle episodes. You can feel the anxiety in the air for what is a talented cast - with 'Ruth' a standout performer. Laura Lilly's character is a 'love to hate', despite many people claiming she makes the show - you do find her seemingly blas√É¬© nature a little grinding, considering the deeds she has done to her husband and family. Solid watch, will be back for season two. I wasn't sure what to think about this new Netflix show and so many of them come out every week that it is sometimes hard to know which ones to watch. I stuck with this crime drama for a few episodes and then got hooked pretty easily. Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) is an accountant who seems like a square until it is revealed that he has been working for a Mexican drug cartel. When the cartel led by Del (Esai Morales) kills Marty's partners in front of him, the accountant has to think fast in order to survive. He explains his plan to get out from on the federal investigation into their money laundering by moving to Missouri and into the Ozarks. Del allows Marty to live so Marty heads home to inform his wife Wendy (Laura Linney) that they have to move. She is having an affair and has told the man about the cartel so Del disposes of him. Marty's kids Charlotte (Sofia Hublitz) and Jonah (Skylar Gaertner) are not thrilled about the relocation.<br/><br/>In the Ozarks, the Byrdes move into a lake community that is full of all sorts of unique characters with regional eccentricities. Staying at a motel, Marty is paranoid of being robbed and he is by Ruth Langmore (Julia Garner) who is part of a local family that has had a lot of trouble with the local law enforcement. Marty has to deal with her and family members like her uncle Russ (Marc Menchaca) by explaining to them that they can't spend any of the money or the IRS will catch them. Charlotte has sparked a relationship with another member of the Langmore family, Wyatt (Charlie Tahan), despite his deception when they first met. Marty has to find businesses he can invest in so he asks around and lands on a dockside bar and cabin rental and a strip club.<br/><br/>Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com I'm gonna start by saying that my favourite show of all time is Breaking Bad and as a fan of that particular show I can guarantee this is not a ripoff. --It's an amazing show and by the way I'm not a fan of Netflix shows, I'm a HBO Original series kinda guy, but they really did it with this one. i honestly hope you'll enjoy it as much as I do. Cheers ;) This somewhat reminds me of Justified and how a US Marshall moves back to where he once lived. But this definitely has a twist based on the character roles. A con moves into the area that he is not from and is hiding from the FEDS. Both shows have drawn me in. Does anyone else agree? I enjoy the plots, will definitely see how season 2 goes when it comes out next year. Only thing that bug that is why most of the main characters look old and wrinkled, which makes Ruth Langmore the prettiest one among them all,while Darlene Snell looks like the Night King from GOT.I will rate higher score if more younger actors/actresses were hired in the show. As gripping as Breaking Bad, the setting is so good and it's not over the top or filmy but keep you glued to the screen. Kudos to the entire team. Wish the sequels are as tight as the first one if not better. Two thumbs up.. collector's item. The casting is apt and the key actors deliver it with aplomb. ...it's not about that, it's about the relationships. I didn't think of Breaking Bad at all until I read these reviews. Okay, it's sort of like it. There's a morally compromised father who you like in spite of his deeds. The writers don't treat the wife like a punching bag for the viewers like they did with Skyler. Wendy is in on the whole thing from the very beginning so she's not constantly scolding like Skyler rightfully did.<br/><br/>You have suspend disbelief. I get money laundering, that's easy, but what I don't get is how he launders 8 million dollars in a couple months AND recoups it 100%. That is never explained and I doubt it's even possible unless you start out with a high capital business to start with which he most certainly does not.<br/><br/>There are plenty of deplorable characters you love to hate, some who redeem themselves even before the season is over. It actually gets better as it goes on. The last 4 episodes are really good. Bateman and Linney are fantastic. The daughter is annoying, as usual. Why writers can't write a realistic teenage girl is beyond me ugh. She's annoyingly and makes illogical decisions constantly. Also, they use murder as a plot device a lot. Like, there hasn't been a twist in 20 minutes, we better kill someone off! Some deaths are satisfying and some are what? You can't just kill of a Mexican drug cartel dude without some sort of consequence.<br/><br/>All that said, I enjoyed the 10 episodes a great deal and am looking forward to season 2! While the plot line of "Ozark" can sometimes strain credulity, the pacing, writing, and acting are so terrific that any plot lapses are soon forgotten. From top to bottom, the entire cast was sensational, as both urban and rural characters were three-dimensional and compelling. As a man constantly flirting with disaster, but escaping, Jason Bateman was excellent. And as a young grifter who under her southern drawl was sharp as a tack, Julia Garner deserves special mention. Apparently Netflix has already green-lighted Ozark for a second season! This is overall a great series. Jason Bateman killed it in the main role and there are plenty of fully developed support characters. The story is also neat and full of twist and turns. I also fell in love with the show's setting in the lake of Ozarks and the town with its gorgeous scenery. <br/><br/>The one thing I didn't like was the annoying female characters: the cheating wife, the thief girl, the stupid daughter, etc. Really turned me off watching them trying to justify their sickening behaviors and try to blame it on other people. <br/><br/>Would have given this series a 10/10 if it weren't for the annoying female characters.
