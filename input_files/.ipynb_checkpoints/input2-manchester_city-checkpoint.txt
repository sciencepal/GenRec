This is a fascinating documentary into modern football. I remember watching a similar programme about Neil Warnock's Sheffield Utd years ago and I suppose if you put this side by side with that it would paint a glaring picture of the way the sport, its players and its managers have changed forever. It's obvious from the outset that money drips off every part of the top level of this sport but it's interesting to see how it has been used to shape footballers into almost superhuman athletes with the best marketing in the world. The reason I enjoyed this documentary so much was mainly the insight it gives into Pep Guardiola. I have obviously heard all the cliches about the man before but this was the first time I felt actually understood why he has been so successful. Yes he has great teams and yes he gets huge amounts of financial support but his passion and outstanding man management are undeniable. Every scene featuring Guardiola is hugely watchable and often gripping.
