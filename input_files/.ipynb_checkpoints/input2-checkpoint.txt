The 1980s wasn't just neon fabrics, side ponytails, and cream colored suits with t-shirts. It was also too much moose, too much make-up, and sock-less penny loafers. It was ugly. Brilliantly, gloriously ugly and tacky. And that's what you see in this show. Superficially speaking, this series (and its characters) looks more authentically of the era than anything else I have seen portrayed on film in the last two decades.<br/><br/>Much of the credit goes to costume designer Beth Morgan, who sifted through photo albums to research the look of the decade, rather than fashion catalogs and television shows and seeing an obstructed, romanticized vision of the era. The characters either wear too much or not enough of everything. This was the eighties, warts and all, and just for that alone, this show is worth a look.<br/><br/>But on top of that, you have a rich, diverse cast of characters, almost all of which are multi-dimensional and bring more to the table than just what they appear to be (while ironically trying to play up their stereotypes to promote the show they are working on). And though some characters sadly don't get the time to fully develop in just ten half-hour episodes, you have reason to believe that they will in future seasons, as the executive producers have proved before in the ongoing seasons of 'Orange is the New Black'.<br/><br/>And then there's the men of GLOW. The women are getting plenty of praise - and deservedly so - but the few male characters depicted also get a chance to shine. Chris Lowell plays the fascinating benefactor to the entire GLOW enterprise. He's the only one - initially - with the vision of what the show should be, and although he isn't introduced until episode three ('The Wrath of Kuntar'), his presence is felt as the unseen force propelling a reluctant director and inexperienced cast to pursue this venture. Bashir Salahuddin is the epitome of the phrase "no small parts" in this series. He exudes a warmth that instantly brings calmness and security to anyone and everyone around him. And although he is given minimal lines and - what some may argue - a generic character in the handful of appearances he makes, you genuinely feel invested and supportive of the developments he undertakes in the latter half of the season.<br/><br/>And finally, there's Marc Maron. Whether or not you've heard about him yet, you will soon and it will be because of this role. He plays the director enlisted with putting an all-female wrestling show together. He comes from a B-list, schlock horror background and only takes the job to finance his dream project, but despite being a sleaze ball with a predilection for the vices of the time, he also genuinely cares for people. He's a guy who will step up and stick his neck out for the people he believes in, and unlike just about all the other characters written with a drug problem, Maron's character isn't dictated by societal expectations to flounder and jeopardize the other characters around him. He's an asset, and not only that, but an absolute necessity. He's also an addict, but a functioning addict, which sadly many people in the industry were back then.<br/><br/>Maron exemplifies everything great about this show. It's not glorifying the era, it's a raw, unapologetic, and - at times - brutally honest depiction of the 1980s in southern California: Flawed, hilarious, and tacky. I don't typically write reviews anymore because, who cares, really. It's just that I've seen some really lame-ass reviews for this show, so I had to chime in. In a world were people are going ballistic that Tim Allen's last opus to moronic men was canceled, shows like GLOW give me hope.<br/><br/>The writing is sharp - funny and moving. The characters are all well drawn with each having clear and distinct personalities. The music, costumes, sets are all authentic-feeling and look just great. And the actors ... wow! These folks are all perfect in their roles. Brie and Maron are almost too awesome. I see awards attention for them - or at least hope I do. Gilpin and the other beautiful, fabulous ladies are all perfect. Each episode you find yourself loving somebody new. Even Bash and Florian.<br/><br/>This show is funny, it's heart-felt, it's energetic, it's wicked fun! Netflix should be proud, they're doing some really good things and this is definitely one of them. After watching mediocre series, GLOW was a breath of fresh air. Every single character had texture and were so compelling to watch. I found myself invested in every one of them. I felt I was watching real people, as opposed to actors acting like real people and what made this possible was the writing AND the talent. <br/><br/>What really sold this series to me was the true depiction of the 1980s; the cinematography, the soundtrack, the casting (this is how people looked in the 80s) and the grit. Such an awesome production. Alison Brie, Betty Gilpin, Marc Maron and Chris Lowell really stood out for me but the whole cast were amazing. Kia Stevens is also a talent to look out for. Her voice alone stood out for me; it was soothing yet powerful. I digress...<br/><br/>The writing was so brilliantly done that I felt every nuance was necessary and added to the overall story. Whether it was a pause, an unspoken word, a sigh, every bit of it was crucial and made the script meaty and real. I can't stand a script that sounds pedestrian and forced, like it has been overly rehearsed. The GLOW writers have the conversational flow of script writing down pat. They deserve awards!!!<br/><br/>Another element that makes this series what it is, is the chemistry between cast members. I believe them; Ruth and Debbie's tension but care for one another, Sam and Bash's good cop, bad cop routine and the ladies ensemble as a whole. There's drama, suspense, COMEDY and great music! A winning combination.<br/><br/>It's so good I've watched both seasons twice. Bring on season 3! Wrestling is a 'sport' I don't know too much about. All I know is that it is scripted TV that plays out in front of live crowds. And they 'fight'. After GLOW, my thoughts on wrestling haven't change much, but I can appreciate the behind the scenes a lot more.<br/><br/>GLOW is one of Netflix's newest additions to their ever so growing library. It follows a group of ladies as they take up a wresting job purely for the money. Set in the 80s where many females struggle to get big time work, the show explores the behind the scenes of wrestling while looking into the life of an actress in the 80s.<br/><br/>There is so much to talk about for this show that it is going to be hard to touch on all the bases. Firstly, this is a show about wrestling but it is a story about the characters. That is my biggest take away from this show. Considering that they only had 10 30 minute episodes, they managed to make you care about all these characters and give each an arc that some shows manage to do across several season. <br/><br/>I have to give a lot of credit to the writing, because without this show being written the way it was, there is no way it turns out as good as it does. Whether it is comedy or emotional dialog, every moment of this show is well crafted and not one line of dialog or one action from a character seems out of place. <br/><br/>An equal amount of credit has to go to the cast. While Allison Brie was the only name I knew entering the show, I exited the show with many stand outs. While Brie was one of them, I thought Marc Maron, Betty Gilpin and Britney Young stood up as the other standouts. That however takes nothing away from the rest of the cast. Each one of them nailed their performance and I couldn't name one member that stood out for the wrong reasons.<br/><br/>I thought the whole show was shot wonderfully. They really captured that 80s LA that I am use to seeing in movies, and if it wasn't for the camera and audio quality, I would have believed that this show was shot in the 80s. Much of that also came from the music choices. Similarly to Stranger Things, the music gave the show so much authenticity when it came to portraying a time period.<br/><br/>Overall, I was really surprised with this show. Firstly it was one of the easiest binge watches I have ever had. I watched the whole show in an afternoon because it was only 5 hours long rather than 10+. I'm not sure if this show will be getting a season 2 but I am all on board with it. I think this is one of the most well made shows around at the moment and it deserves all the credit it can get.<br/><br/>9/10 For all the Gen X and Y audiences this show is a nostalgic blast from the past! The music is spot on, the characters engaging, the story smart and funny. Definitely another hit for Netflix.<br/><br/>The show runners fully understand what wrestling is all about. The soap opera drama, the choreography, the archetype characters, it is all there.<br/><br/>I was curious and skeptical when I saw the previews, but I gave it a shot because Alison Brie has great taste in roles so I took a chance and am grateful I did. There is something for all viewers.<br/><br/>I hope there are plans to have a Brett Hart cameo in this show. As far as wrestlers go, he was the true master at making everything in the ring look painfully real.<br/><br/>This is a definite watch for anyone who enjoys good comedic dramas.<br/><br/>Be sure to check it out. Glow is about a completely dysfunctional group of women wrestlers, American style in the 80's. That sentence alone should spark everyone's interest. And it keeps on giving. This series let's its characters screw up to triumph brilliantly. It's mix of sex, drugs and wrestling is a stroke of genius. <br/><br/>I know it's high praise. But don't worry going in with too high expectations. Glow will not disappoint. If anything, it'll still blow you away, even if you see the perfect 10's. It's well deserved. The actors seem to relish their roles. It becomes hard even to pick a favorite character. Every episode has you rooting for someone new. <br/><br/>It's characters are all desperately seeking both love and success. They often don't get it but it doesn't matter. They become a team against all odds and persevere. The build ups to the finales are so well crafted I frequently found myself having goosebumps when all the drama outside the ring comes together when the wrestling starts. <br/><br/>It's just... see it. After having watched the first three episodes of Glow, I can say that this is really quite an interesting show. It's part of a new wave of "direct-to-VoD" series that don't have to bow to cable TV standards in terms of language or nudity, but also concerning story development. Glow is a comedy alright, but it tackles difficult subjects like adultery and hard life choices. I would not say that this combination clicks every single time, but there are really quite awesome moments (and very funny ones, too) and I enjoy the basic setup and characters a lot. The acting is also pretty good.<br/><br/>I am curious to see where this is going, but I have to say that I'm very happy that there are shows like this that try to break a little from the mold. I was pretty skeptical of this show from the previews.--I was wrong to be so skeptical!! It's smart, funny and emotional at times. The costuming and soundtrack are great, as is the entire show. It's really well done and my only complaint is that it's a half hour show when I thought the episodes could have been longer. --I guess I just wanted more of a good thing! It really is better than the previews would leave you to believe. I can't recommend this enough for anyone who enjoys something different from their shows! I adored it! I watched it twice through straight away. Take every lighthearted, cult 80's film from your youth and roll them into one, then inject the diverse casting and perspectives that all of those films were sorely missing, sprinkle on some amazing 80's fashion and music, serve with some fearless subject matter (storylines covering miscarriage and abortion, misogyny, anxiety. Racism and infidelity) and you get GLOW! What cinema in the 80's SHOULD have looked like. Just like Dirty Dancing, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Back to the Future and The Breakfast Club, this show is going to be one that I watch again and again....and again. Something that I put on when life gets stressful and I just need to disappear into my kitsch 80's fantasy for a while. The episodes are short but impactful, the dialogue is fun and full of humour, after watching it you and your friends will just want to dress up like a wrestlers and start practising moves on each other! An all round hit for me, 10/10! I don't know as to why so many people hate it. It has 3 very important things going for itself: 1) Stellar Cast. Allison Brie is unrecognizable. Every character feels well sketched out. 2) Gripping story-line. Albeit a bit cheesy but it's intentional, I think and it's good kind of cheesy. 3) Brilliant screenplay and impeccable cinematography.<br/><br/>If you've ever been a fan of 80's comedy and you are a sucker for some good old underdog story, then this is the show for you.<br/><br/>It's mostly predictable yet every scene feels like a breath of fresh air. Every character is flawed and yet incredibly likable. And perhaps most importantly it doesn't have even a single dull frame.<br/><br/>Can't wait for the 2nd season. The music, clothing and sets really capture the 80's vibe. Being born in 78 I know my 80's. I loved real wrestling like John Carpenter before it was ruined in the late 90's. this captures that vibe so well. Best acting I've seen in a super long time. I loved everything about this so much. Season 3 on the other hand, I don't know if I just get burnt out on shows after a couple of seasons cause I watch so many or if this season is just that bad. Every article you read goes on about how this show is better this season than ever, but I disagree. We have to delve into more social issues than ever before, getting serious about gay and lesbian issues, racism, and sexism.<br/><br/>Why does every show have to be an after school special these days? I'm just trying to be entertained without having all this shoved down my throat with every program I watch.<br/><br/>Another problem I had was all the side stories and the big departure from what this show is about, which is women's wrestling. I didn't need to see the long drawn out drag shows, the singing, and the spoken word scenarios. Also there was a ton more s.x in this season, cause I guess this show has to compete with all the other shows that have constant T and A. Could have done without it. GLOW is loosely based on the actual GLOW (Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling) TV show which was a cheesy but charming women's wrestling show which ran for four seasons in the late 80s.<br/><br/>This is a really funny, heartwarming and sometimes exciting show. It is a very good combination of characters and wrestling. As a lifelong pro wrestling fan, the show successfully shows wrestling for being fun without making fun of it. I could have appreciated more insight into how hard it is to be a wrestler especially taking bumps which take a toll on the body. That being said, it does a very good job showing the people and getting us behind them. They are flawed people but likable and ultimately, you root for their success.<br/><br/>The performances are uniformly excellent. Alison Brie is a capable lead who keeps the movie centered. Marc Maron, as the frustrated but deep down decent cokehead director does a fabulous job. Betty Gilpin as the slightly arrogant former soap opera star is brilliant especially since she has a lot of emotional scenes. I loved the wrestler cameos which I will keep a secret.<br/><br/>To conclude, the show is a wonderful love letter to wrestling fans. It would have been convenient to mock wrestling as stupid and dumb but the show avoids that pitfall. For new fans, it would serve as a good conduit into the crazy world of wrestling and for wrestling fans, it shows a simpler era where we were not smarks who picked apart every booking decision. Highly recommended! Season 3 so bad we turned it off after 2 episodes. Show became a soap opera and a bad one at that. No wrestling which made the show fun in 1st 2 seasons. Allot of these shows should just stop while there ahead The first two seasons were excellent, the 3rd one really dropped the ball. Marc Moran who plays Sam is easily the best character, has basically had his character made redundant. The 3rd season seems to really pushing an agenda. The writers seem to be more worried about pushing their agenda than actually producing quality scripts with good storylines. And there was virtually no wrestling in the entire season. It turned into a soap opera centering on everyone's relationships and personal life. I'm jumping on the bandwagon, season 3 was terrible! I felt like I was watching the show for the first time and one that I would not have finished at that. Poor directing. Poor scripts. Poor political agenda. Whatever the issue is, please fix it for season 4. And for Pete's sake please bring back Sam! I have to think back hard, was he even a main character this season? If I can say one positive thing, it would be that ................... nope, nothing.......I'm at a loss. I was a big fan of the original GLOW and Seasons 1 and 2 were a lot of fun. Season 3 has deteriorated into an avalanche of back story with so many sexual scenes, that we just abandoned it. When Ruth exposed herself, that's when we said enough. We made it to ep 3 with not a wrestling match in sight.<br/><br/>C'mon guys, why fix what wasn't broken? Just sit down and binge it on Netflix.<br/><br/>How they build characters, the live show, the mishaps, just thoroughly enjoyable.<br/><br/>Addictive like Stranger Things. I've been a big fan of GLOW - both the original wrestling series in the 80's, and the Netflix series. Just finished watching season 3, and was very disappointed. I realized that the funniest and most entertaining aspects of Netflix seasons 1 and 2 happened during the wrestling-related scenes, where the cast members were either in the ring or training. Season 3 was almost all about personal relationships, with very little wrestling. It went from a show that appealed to everybody in the first two seasons, to a "chick-flick" or "rom-com" type of series that was directed mostly at female viewers in season 3. (I'm a guy.)<br/><br/>Way too many sex scenes, which I consider to be what bad screenwriters do to fill time when they can't come up with entertaining ideas.<br/><br/>And even though I consider myself slightly liberal, I am getting sick of political correctness and social justice being crammed down my throat, which season 3 of GLOW decided to do.<br/><br/>That said, I hope the series gets renewed for a 4th season, that season 3 was an aberration, and GLOW returns to what it was doing for the first two seasons. I loved the first 2 seasons but season 3 is a disjointed affair. The season tries to focus more on the individual stories of the characters as opposed to the wrestling but falls short in my view. The relationships the 2 main characters enter into lack credibility. Against all this its still very well acted but the writers/producers need to decide where this is going and stick to it instead of this mish mash of half stories. I usually dislike Netflix shows. Especially those with super heroes. But I gotta admit. This was a pretty good one.<br/><br/>When it comes to reviewing good shows or movies it's just too hard for me because there are too many aspects that I liked about the show. So I never know where to begin with. But here are the things I enjoyed about this one:<br/><br/>1) The time setting. I always enjoy 80's and this show gave me that sense of 80's pretty well.<br/><br/>2) Acting was really good too. Especially with the character Ruth. This show involved a lot of acting within acting within acting. I mean it's a hard one. As an actor Alison Brie, you are the character Ruth of the show GLOW portraying a mediocre actor trying to find a good job for yourself. Once you find a fake wrestling show to take part in then that involves another level of acting which she "learns" by training within the show. Geez it's really hard to explain but I can summarize it by calling it something cheesy like actingception (derived from the movie inception just in case...) It's not just with Alison Brie but all the other wrestler women too. <br/><br/>3) The humor from time to time was predictable but it was still enjoyable and was a little dark, which I enjoy a lot. I believe there was even an OldBoy reference when one of the wrestlers happens to be the daughter of the director and then his daughter tells him what is what when the director tries to make out with his own daughter unkowingly. That moment was so odd and uncomfortable I was both smiling and at the same time embarrassed. Again hard to explain.<br/><br/>This show could get a 10 from me if the wresting moves were just a tiny bit more realistic. Of course they were doing it cheesy on purpose but the level of cheesiness could be reduced just a little bit more to make it seem like these women worked really hard and they started as desperate actors being clueless about wrestling but in the end they put out something that's the result of hard work. I guess I was expecting a much better development in terms of wrestling. They could even use rope tricks green screen CGI I wouldn't care really. <br/><br/>For instance the part in the show where Ruth and Machu Pichu were demonstrating their moves for the first time. They were so amazing. I was like wow these are going to turn into real wrestlers by the end of the show. But as the show proceeded it actually turned into camera techniques to hide actors' incompetence at wrestling. <br/><br/>I don't criticize the show because of my own expectations. I criticize because I fear that some people might find wrestling scenes too cheesy and it might turn them off. Wheras people like me would be okay thinking all that wrestling to be really good on a symbolic level.<br/><br/>Anyways I talked too much. You should really give this show a try. Great story, all about 80s wrestling until season 3 when the political messaging about sexism, racism and homophobia came to the forefront..good job Hollywood! Ms. Brie has shown her considerable talents in several recent projects, however here she deserves special congratulations as she throws herself with abandon into her part and truly brings her character to life. The dialogue is terrific throughout and this project has Emmy written all over it. However, the real stand out star, especially for those of us who survived the 80's has got to be the music. Just when you think you've heard that one amazing song from back in the day, along comes another that has been out of the regular rotation for decades and which causes all manner of memories to come rushing back. I truly was blown away at some of the musical choices, but all of them were used to maximum affect to drive the story.<br/><br/>The excess, drug fueled and tee-shirt-with-a-suit decade is recreated so vividly, not only by the characters and the excellent production design, but also the idea to incorporate actual news broadcasts which serve to show the ridiculousness of the era. None more so than Mrs. Reagan's ill advised "Just say No" campaign but also the bizarre clip of the hijacked airline pilot being interviewed from the cockpit with a gun to his dead trying to explain why he prefers the airline food to the local Lebanese cuisine (true story).<br/><br/>The producers get it right on so many levels, such as the fervent belief at the time that wrestling was indeed a real sport and the truth a not very well kept secret. But it didn't have to be: People wanted to believe it and just like today where the most accepted facts go challenged regularly by the vociferous minority (climate change, vaccinations, etc.) this show gives us a window into the recent past so that we may discover that for all that is new and shiny, some things will always remain the same.<br/><br/>I encourage you not to be discouraged with the idea of watching a series about wrestling or a female ensemble (god forbid!), but instead, be prepared for some of the finest acting from Miss Brie provided by simply amazing writers and brought to life by those cherished few who show us once again that they are at the top of their game. This went from being A Show about Women coming together, empowering and supporting each other to be their best - - enjoyed it!
NOW Season 3 became about Lesbianism, Menage-a-Trois, Gay Pride, and "Men are bad" Political Propaganda, it just ruined it for us.
The Truth is the Wrestling, which was one of the most enjoyable aspects of the show, became such a non-entity in the Storyline, it could've been called, "PLOP" (Pretty Leftists' Obvious Propaganda) without missing a beat.
Too bad.
We liked the characters and their back stories from the first, and mostly all of the second seasons.
Just wish they hadn't jumped the shark. Absolutely amazing show! Sooo nostalgic and interesting! Go women power! I was about 10 or 11 when the original GLOW was on and I loved it. It was an hour of irreverent and terrible comedy surrounded by women doing something I'd only seen men do - wrestle. Even with the terrible acting and costumes and the dash of racism, i felt empowered.<br/><br/>This series had me hooked from the beginning. As much as I worried about Alison Brie being miscast, she proved from the start that she was born for this show. Every actress and character brings something to the table, although with only 8 episodes each season, we won't get as much character development as we should with the minor characters. Marc Maron brings a brilliance i never knew he was capable of bringing (I say this as a fan of his.). Once you see these characters in action, you root for them. They're the underdogs of their own story and they're fabulous.<br/><br/>Part of my love for this show is the nostalgia but most of it stems for being a well-written, well-acted, engrossing show. This is one of Netflix's underrated gems. The first two seasons were original, cool and funny and you really warmed to the characters. Two shows in and Season 3 just feels like any other soap opera and is almost difficult to watch, such a shame as a great cast and concept has been let down by poor writing and a lack of focus. Season one brought a show with a new, fresh, intriguing concept. The story, plot, acting, nostalgia were all executed brilliantly. Season two continued the high quality though to a lesser degree. But then season three happened.<br/><br/>Is Hollyweird really this far gone that it can't see when its pushed its aggressive social agenda to the detriment of the overall product? Its doing so absolutely RUINED this show, just as other commenters have stated. Season three is almost entirely about homosexuality. And it goes about executing this theme in X-rated fashion. This show went from relative PG to basically po rn. "Gay" dominates the entire season, it hovers over every scene, it's the topic of almost every conversation, it's ever-present. And while the rest of the show tries to stay true to the era, somehow the social justice part is current-day, as modern-day cues like "homophobia" and rainbows are used. I guess remaining true to the era takes a back seat when there's a leftist lesson to be taught.<br/><br/>At any rate, the few times the social engineering is not dominant, the plot is scattered and unfocused. Even further, "GLOW" is like an afterthought even to the point it Is painted as something the characters hate and want to escape. The story for the main character in particular seems to be setting her up to move away from GLOW.<br/><br/>It's to the point this show could be named something else. Season three moved it so far from the original plot. It's now something else entirely. I hope season four can steer the show back but I'm not sure I'll run to watch it. In fact, after slogging through season three, I think I'm removing this show from my Watchlist. I don't know what it is anymore. It was a solid 8 for me, I've now deducted points. So very disappointed. Quite frankly I didn't think I'd enjoy the story, but three seasons in, I'm hooked.
The whole show gives out a somewhat magical realism vibe. It contains two distinct tastes: down-to-earth normality and flying-high fantasy. The whole GLOW thing started as an idea, and with the incredible efforts from Bash, Sam and all the girls, who at the beginning seemed a little nutty and strange, it came to light and formed into a fantastic show, and the relationship among them as coworkers transformed into profound friendship, and all the hardship paid off. People like this kind of story because, well, sowing dream inside mediocrity and reap success, that's life.
Besides, the characters are handled exquisitely, with their own signatures, especially Ruth, Debbie and Sam, I'm seeing three-dimensional traits unfolded as the story evolved. The fact that they have enough complexity to intrigue audiences and yet are not too complex for people to relate to, is impressive.
Anyway, a great show! In this warped time fragment we are currently living in with a virus rampaging the world, and a good part where I come from on Long Island, isolation is a fact of life, and what a way to take your mind off of the seriousness and maddening global situation. This show is nothing but fun, and with sports being such a big part of the country's make up, you get that too. I'm watching the 3 seasons a second time. And, Geena Davis in a half naked Las Vevas showgirl outfit. Anyone that does not enjoy this show, has to be some kind of up tight individual. This show did not come across well to me in the trailer or promos. The show itself exceeds anything I could have imagined. It's Whity, it's touching, I should have never doubted this show. Sarcasm, Comedy, Drama and so much more.<br/><br/>Don't read about it. Just watch 1 or 2 episodes. You'll get hooked.<br/><br/>Almost everything about it is as near perfect as it gets. If one person could run the whole show and if that was possible and in an ideal world they deserved the highest title for it and was awarded, all that rings true for Alison Brie. She is just amazing. I haven't seen good acting of this caliber in a long time and I am not just talking about her but the whole team. Even the young hotshot male producer acts so good.<br/><br/>This is an amazing show, every aspect about it, the script, direction, acting and everything else is perfect. I gave it a 9. Absolutely amazing. Glow is a well done serie. It has the feminist theme all over but they use it as a fuel and not as the main character. The struggle of the wrestlers to evolve form their caterpillar and into a cocoon in season 1 and, finally into a beautiful moth´s in season 2 (cause butterflies are way too use) show us that you can always succed in this aprehensive world as long as you stay true with yourself. 
The way Glow works with topics such as homosexualism, homophobia, power abuse, sexism and drugs is perfect. They come natural and they not shove it on our mouths like others series that try to stay on the edge of this social justice time. The writtings are fantastic. With plot twist and real characters that make you feel empathy towards them. 
Alison Brie is just awesome in this serie and, in my opinion, take the serie´s rythm in a way that just a few others main characters can. <br/><br/>This serie is a must watch if you want a good storytelling, a appealing soap opera or just want to see a nostalgic show. Trust me, you won´t regret it. In worst scenario, you will end in season 2 with a different point of view about the world. If you ask me, this was a real mind blowing serie and i can´t wait to see some material for season 3. This show follows out-of-work actress Ruth as she enters the newly developed world of women's wrestling and it's a lot of fun! There wasn't as much action as some may have anticipated, but I think it's important to have a solid intro season for the characters of the show and it succeeded in that. The two main actresses both have spot-on comedic timing and had me giggling most of every episode and Marc Maron is perfectly cast. The show sums up the era well and properly captures the confusion and bewilderment about wrestling during that time. Hair, make-up, set dressing, and music is all great and takes me back in time. Each episode can stand on its own as well. The episodes are relatively short and don't drag on. Even if the follow-up seasons aren't good, the first season is a real achievement and I hope everyone involved is proud of that. Season 1 and 2 was good 3 sucks the big one and I have canceled Netflix for good. There is nothing good on there anymore In fairness, the concept of the show is a little trashy since it's based on a trashy 80s cable series. The first two seasons though were really well written, delved into the lives of the actresses and producers and nailed the time period. There were some explicit scenes here and there but I let it slide because that wasn't really the focus. The third season, however, spends the vast majority of the time on explicit lewd sex scenes in addition to pushing a political agenda. I turned it off towards the end of episode 9, right when a threesome was getting started between Bash, his wife, and some male prostitute. I probably won't watch Season 4. The first season I enjoyed because it was about wrestling in light of the actual G.L.O.W. from the 80's. Then in season 2 it seems to drop the wrestling plot and go into subplots with lots of character drama and scenes that didn't add anything to the story except throw in LGBT undertones while the wrestling started taking a back seat. In season 3 the wrestling is sitting on the back seat, the LGBT aspect is in the front, there's more pointless subplots that don't have anything to do with wrestling and honestly I don't even care to see another season after this one.<br/><br/>I really don't even know who this show is aimed at. It seemed from the first season it was aimed at wrestling fans and anyone could watch the series. Season 2 & 3 seemed to be aimed at the LGBT community and Women. If that's your thing and you want to see a drama and LGBT stuff unnecessarily thrown in your face for absolutely no reason at all than this is your show. Ironically if you're watching this specifically because you expected it to be about wrestling than you will be disappointing. As of now the show is 95% drama 5% wrestling. They spent more time talking about Debbie and parenthood problems and the lesbian relationship between 2 of the other wrestlers than they did showing wrestling. I mean the guy doing his drag queen show got more screen time than the wrestling mat. Who is this show for at this point?<br/><br/>Oh and if you're offended that I mentioned LGBT or Drag Queens of whatever guess what. I watched this show because I wanted to see wrestling. This show is honestly an insult to the real G.L.O.W. It's literally nothing but a stereo type about women. Them getting moody periods, having mood swings, cat fighting, man drama, etc. etc. it really just goes right down the list. So sorry if I offended you because I wanted an actual show about women wrestling showing the hard work they put in at a time when the only time people watched women wrestling was when they wore Bikini's in the mud.<br/><br/>If you understand that G.L.O.W. was to be taken seriously as a shot against stuff like the WCW and WWF at the time than you might just realize that this show is beyond an offensive joke to anyone that came to see a show about wrestling. So don't get mad at me because I wanted a show that took women's wrestling seriously and am not interested in watching drag queens singing. Glow ended up being destroyed like most good TV shows by that mystical group of people that are brought onto a TV show once it is popular so they can infest the show with the insane "wokeness" PC culture that is destroying all entertainment. Weird. Why go from catering to a big audience to virtually no one? Just so you appear virtuous? Bizarre. Keep acting. For as insecure as that man is on his podcast, he nailed his role. I heard on another podcast that the roll was basically written with him in mind and only him.<br/><br/>I find myself liking mostly all of the characters except the wannabe actress character drives me nuts; I hope they make her more likable. There are a couple of characters with really weird story lines so we'll see where that goes in the future. I assumed I wasn't going to like the producer son character but I do! Oh and I didn't even recognize Kate Nash!! She's a great actress as well, I was pretty surprised as she is mostly known as a singer.<br/><br/>The story-line is fun and serious and I was able to binge watch this series. As a kid from the 80's, I felt reliving this wonderful time period !<br/><br/>The production designs are very close to what I remember. But missing mullet haircuts :-) And the soundtrack filled with 80's songs and music. And linked to events of that period (the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger on live TV for example).<br/><br/>The main cast is fantastic (I've discovered Betty Gilpin and her broad range of acting) and the supporting cast too (hope to see those actresses in other projects). Each episode is masterfully written and directed.<br/><br/>I loved the episode "Outward Bound" in season 3: mainly written for the supporting cast. Used to love this show season 1 had just one episode that was not family oriatarwd, swain 2 was great, the whole family was able to watch without any issues, but season 3 went of the rails, not only it had nothing to do about Glow the TV show I grew up watching, but the main character becomes just a side character. First episode was about sex, second, sex, third same crap. Then we go into the left with just explisid sex and sex exploration. Is if the show was taking over a production crew trying to make the show a sex show that a story show. My brother and I used to watch GLOW on Saturday mornings when we were children, so I began watching for nostalgic reasons. The first 2 seasons were funny, engaging, and I loved them! In the third season, the show gets overly sexual and political. I'm just so tired of shows I like going in this direction. Most of the world is not gay - hello does anyone hear me? I don't want to watch nude scenes between a man and a woman, let alone people of the same sex. Why with such great actors and writing would they choose to sleaze it up like this? I watched for entertainment - not to be indoctrinated or politically swayed. If there is a Season 4, I hope they move out of Vegas and the sleaziness and politics moves out as well. What a great little show. I just wish more than 10 episodes were made for this first (and hopefully not last) season! I loved the authentic 80s feel they captured with the hair, wardrobe, sets and music - they definitely got that right. The characters were all interesting and there were some great comedic moments. Each episode is quite short and moves along at a cracking pace and is loads of fun. Looking forward to more! Much like the tragedy that was Black Sails this show that was great the first 2 seasons has been turned into a soap opera. You know its a soap when you can skip entire episodes and it males no difference when watching a series. Not sure why shows seem to take this dreadful turn after 2 seasons, but I hope it stops. There are so few shows worth watching. Sad. Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling (GLOW) Season Three Review:<br/><br/>I just finished watching Season 3 and a great season as usual. Great characterizations, a lot of humor mixed with a little bit of sadness here and there. Truly one of the best shows on Netflix, hope to see another or several more seasons of this. I fell in love with it. The characters are extremely lovable and the story makes me want to keep watching I am currently now binge watching this show. It would be great in any season, but in what is mostly a waste land in Other Programming this season, this is a thirst quencher. Intelligent, original, an all around A+. A couple neg comments were about stereotyping in beginning episodes, but that really just appears to be an important part of the set up. Give it an episode or two, laugh and enjoy. I am not a big fan of tv shows because I don't have time to watch multiple episodes. In a movie is more simple: I stay there for 90-240 minutes and that's it....the movie is done. However rarely I get captured by a short TV series with a max of 2 seasons. And GLOW was absolutely amazing. No spoilers given, just watch the damn series, you won't regret it. It's just PERFECTLY done, nothing bad to say about it. Amazing story, amazing costumes, amazing plot, amazing ending, everything is JUST WOOW :) Or I could say is ""GLOW"" :P Although it has a slow start, it eventually pulls together and reminds us why we loved the first two seasons. Can't the gorgeous ladies of wresting have it all? Successful career, family, health and happiness. Kudos to the cast and crew for another job well done. Kept the momentum high from last season, incredibly heartfelt and very watchable I do not know what happened, was it a change of writers but this felt like a completely different show to what what i watched previously. The main character betty owned this show, the scene where they changed gimmicks and i enjoyed the story with sam and his daughter... otherwise this is now trying to appeal to a different audience and trying to push some sort of agenda. i really hate that so many shows are doing this now. GLOW was in the 80's, these twitterverse/socialmedia ethics were not present! I am torn between watching a season 4, as season 3 was terrible. I really like the cast, but these writers are drinking too much of the Hollywood kool-aid 2019 and giving us a show that is political rather than factual. netflix... the sex scenes were was so unnecessary, pushing an agenda because if they wanted to make it factual they would have had the casting couch for wrestling, girls wanting to learn wrestling would be ring rats for the men, lets go seedy if you want to make it damn seedy. I truly feel like season 3 robbed me, robbed me of my time. awful! i loved the time travel to wrestling in the 80's and season 1 and 2 were great but just end this now. Then of course.. gets political. How many shows will be ruined by Hollywood trashy political propoganda? It is Swingers meets Rocky 1 and it is great.
I love this show. It is simple it is well made, it is funny and uneasy at times and it is set in the 80s.<br/><br/>It is about a woman actress who is down on her luck, and she decides in desperation to agree to an alternative acting job that might be porn. It turns out to be a wrestling-TV-show and she finds out that she is good at it, and because of her the wrestling thing becomes amazing. The show is about artistic performance. How to stage an entertaining show. In wrestling form through TV form.<br/><br/>It is clever, it is funny, it is dramatic, yet it not a comedy or a straight-up drama. It has compelling character moments. It has conflicts that lead to drama. It has impressive production value, not only is it set in the 80s but its believable and authentic : all the sets, the costumes, even the make-up is great and on point. The music from the 80s is of course great and exciting. And then you have the wrestling.<br/><br/>Wrestling as a performance itself is pretty interesting/exciting. The issue with films and TV show that are about another art form is always how to do you translate the energy or ambiance of it. It is difficult. It applies to anything from literature to theatre to musicals to sports. TV and film most of time have a hard time adapting them because they focus generally on the narrative/story and they miss completely the point of it, which might the characters, the energy, whatever.
Wrestling is akin to theatre, it is a live performance. A lot of it relies on the stage performance; How the actors appear on stage and how they interact with each other but also with the audience. Even the WWF cannot recapture perfectly a wrestling match; being there vs watching in on TV, it is pretty close and they have had years to fine-tuned their techniques, but it is still not a 1:1 copy.<br/><br/>GLOW gets away with it because the wrestling is false, or at least they can have however many takes they need. Yet the show achieves into creating an experience that is realistic to the viewer. It feels real. It feels authentic. It feels like I am watching women-wrestling. I feel like I am in the gym with them. And that creates not only a good show but it is also visually appealing/exciting to watch.<br/><br/>The only thing I disliked is that the show becomes more a sitcom as time moves on. It is kind of the reverse of Community where it starts as a sitcom and then slowly shifts into something more interesting.
On the other hand it is only fair. It is TV format. They want to keep you watching. And it works.
Also I am aware that I liked the A story lines more because the B story lines cleansed my palate in a way. But I would have loved this as a 2h movie with only the wrestling rags-to-riches story line. In other words there is a lot of fat in this show, a lot of characters and story lines you could drop and it would not affect the core of the show, but just like in a juicy piece of meat, the fat is what makes it delicious. It gives the show overall more heart and character.<br/><br/>That being said the most appreciable thing this show has is its reverence of wrestling. The show is a bona fide love letter to wrestling. Wrestling in this show is not only beautiful and noble; it is also innovative, clever and funny. By looking at it through the lens of women's wrestling and placing it in the 80s the show gets rid of the history of the superstars and the entertainment machine modern wrestling has become. It speak to what is wrestling at its core. It goes back to this antique noble art of showmanship.
The beauty of it is that wrestling is only one-step removed from filmmaking, and so you get the behind-the-scenes movie-making self-referential self-aware shtick but applied to wrestling: a genre that is ultimately more obscure.
It is good, it is cool to see not only the references, but also the show sows in its narrative all these wrestling techniques and gimmicks, for instance the wrestler incognito in the audience, the over the top drama etc..<br/><br/>I love the characters and the actors. Of course Alison Brie is the star, the best actress giving the best performance. I have never found her to be bad in anything, but here she shines. I found it clever that the protagonist/antagonist tension is subverted here, with the audience being on the side of Ruth who is arguably the bad guy. And Debbie who would be on the right side in real life is here the villain. And it works ultimately because every actress is perfect in their role. Then again, when the show switches into sitcom mode the central tension is erased a bit.<br/><br/>Marc Maron plays Marc Maron. It is funny in meta sort of way. He is a washed-up cynical and grumpy director. He is the best though. His character/persona is perfect in this context, he elevates the material. I have caught myself being more interested in any scene he was. His character reinforces the depression, the bleakness. But he avoids being one-dimensional or annoying. He is a hack, but with a passion. And it plays off Alison Brie's Ruth who is more idealistic and wide-eyed. It is a great duo of incompatible misfits, and in a sense their relationship is a driving force of the show, with Sam Sylvia being a reluctant father-figure to the overachiever Ruth.<br/><br/>The show could be compared to Breaking Bad, with wrestling instead of cooking meth and stardom and fame instead of money/power. The tone is similar. It is a tale of an underappreciated genius who finds herself by giving in this very odd sub-culture. Of course BB is more epic an deeper. BB is more mature; but Glow is reminiscent of BB, in a good way.<br/><br/>The first season is centered on wrestling and wrestling craft. It is the strongest season yet, the ladies figure out their personas, the storylines get established.<br/><br/>The second season explores the world of low-budget TV in the 80s. It builds smartly on s01 and opens the scope of the show. It is maybe more watchable because the interpersonal drama is more prevalent. You get to know the secondary characters etc...<br/><br/>The third season moves to Las Vegas and shifts to Swingers meets Behind the Candelabra. This season is the most confident in what it is and what it wants to be about, but it still manages to surprise and entertain. Most importantly the change of scenery is welcome, in contrast to the bleak sets of the beginning. I loved all the episodes of every season. It was so good to watch a series that isn't centered around violence/crime/murder. It's clever and well written. Simply just fun to watch. I love how it portrays the struggle of being different. Also it's so clever how it represents the difficulties of being a women. Doing this all in a down-to-Earth way without turning into some ultrafeminist agenda. I would highly recommended it to everyone. I love the fact that there is a female centric cast without it being shoved it your face. Alison Brie and Betty Gilpin are fantastic and contrasting them against Marc Maron's dryness and sarcastic wit makes this show wholly enjoyable.
Despite being a comedy the show manages to show some pathos which adds extra depth.
There is nothing like this show, totally original and fresh. it is a Dolby Vision to enjoy. I realize that most reviews will talk about story, acting, etcÂ…the essence to any good review. <br/><br/>If you have a 4K TV with Dolby Vision you are in for a treat. As of mid 2017, program content in Dolby Vision is pretty rare. Netflix is offering GLOW in Dolby Vision and it is beautiful.<br/><br/>Even if I hated GLOW (I don't), I would watch it more than once. You have to see it to be believed.<br/><br/>Technically speaking, it will open your eyes. Tremendous effort to fill time here. Way too much, unnecessary nudity and sex. The only redeemable episode involves the underground show for "gays." I don't think it was necessary to have Geena Davis do the whole "showgirl" schtick. That was frankly embarrassing. They are trying to spice up the show by adding a lot of nudity and sex and the series is much worse off for it. Disappointing. This is another hit for Netflix! The characters are are very interesting and they really drive the story. The audience gets to know most of them fairly well, which is difficult to do with such an large cast. From the trailer, I thought it was a straight comedy, but it isn't, though there are many funny moments. It's serious at some parts, sometimes a little dark and it is laced with misogynistic theme, but it works well mixed with such strong female characters. It's hard to put your finger on, but it is worth a watch. I found my self smiling and laughing, cringing, and even moved all in one episode. It is certainly entertaining. The work the actresses put in the physical element is impressive. I binged the season in a week and I cannot wait for season 2. Such a wonderful cast and storyline!!! It definitely shows Women empowerment is very important especially for the series. A+++ series!! I wasn't sure about this, i just started watching on Netflix one night. Wow what a surprise. Yes, there's a little relationship quasi-drama, but that just makes the good parts even better. Alison Brie's campy over-the-top performances while she searches for her character are hilarious. And I'm glad to see a series for Marc Maron. It must have been written for him from the start. Nobody else could portray Sam the way he does. By the end of the series, with the girls in the ring, I'm rolling on the floor laughing at the whole thing. Great satire of pro-wrestling, and great acting by all the principals. Looking forward to the next installment. As a Wrestling & Marc Maron fan i was looking really forward to this and had to watch the show.<br/><br/>For a comedy show to me it's just not funny enough - more like womens afternoon coffee table humour, hehe.. sorry :) - and as drama just no thrill at all, it's more sort of a very light and almost shallow comedy (comparable imo to the last two OITNB seasons).<br/><br/>Alison Brie is a great lead for the show, her performance really well. The other females are alright even though if you can really see there are no wrestling skills (apart from Awesome Kong obviously), the original GLOW wrestler were better. And Marc Maron is just Marc Maron. :)<br/><br/>There's some really cool wrestler cameos (John Morrison, Carlito, Brodus Clay), disappointing a bit though that John Morrison was not kept as a regular character.<br/><br/>This show to me has a way too "light" taste, there's nothing really to it, "lightweight" entertainment, too mediocre and almost boring for what it could be - for how cool it could be with this brilliant idea of a 80s wrestling comedy/dramedy show. Still not totally bad, but not more than 5 Points from me. I thought seasons 1 & 2 were fun and entertaining! But then came season 3. Oh my, this just got real! I love it!! This is one of the best shows out there! The story lines are complex and deep. The writing and acting are phenomenal! Please don't discount this show. Settle into it and let flow (or glow) over you. This show is fantastic, engaging, enjoyable and addictive. Alison Brie and Betty Gilpin are absolute stars and bring so much to the show, although the whole cast is stellar!<br/><br/>This show gave me a new appreciation for the physicality and storytelling behind wrestling. I was a bit sad there wasn't as much wrestling in season 3, but the story was still strong.<br/><br/>Well worth your time. Desperately hope there is a season 4!!! I'm searching other video series or movies starring Betty Gilpin then I found GLOW. It didn't disappoint me :-) I love the cast and the story. In recent years there's been a deluge of female fronted shows/films ejaculated from the US entertainment industry. Unfortunately most have either been maladroit SNL-style remakes (rip-offs) of male fronted outings or cliquish austere affairs painted in several coats of political correctness with little time for the human condition. However! Finally there's a show created by (I think) & fronted by women that's original, accessible & well written - Glow.<br/><br/>The best creations are always the most accessible; they don't alienate or make you aware of any agenda or victim-chic. They're just good. Glow hits all the marks & talking of marks, Marc Maron is vital to the show as his sardonic masculine character is a necessary sour in the sweet. The show really wouldn't work without him.<br/><br/>All the actors do a good Job. Brie does Brie & Brie does Brie well & Marc Maron is a real treat. No one can do sardonic man like a man after all.<br/><br/>Cons: Kate Nash's thickly laid on Working class (what I presume is Essex) accent. It's a touch uncool/condescending/clownish - She looks great though.<br/><br/>What's wonderful about this show is that it's just good. Things will be said about it being female-centric (& that's not a problem), however, it's so good you don't notice or care. More of this please girls. ... and Alison Brie is both gorgeous and a great actor... fell in love with her in Community and she really shines here... a good TV series is about the characters and this show has it all... i actually HATE wrestling for all its cheese and corny theatrics but that made zero difference here... about to binge Season 3 right now... i'm sure it'll deliver.. Solid acting especially from the two main girls. Believable but silly, fun fun...it should probably be an 8 quality wise but an extra point for just being loveable. Season two comes out in one day! Started off good , struggling actresses stoop to do a wrestling show to be on tv, the low end of hi end . Guy who played Their director was great , totally harsh politically incorrect guy who was old school w just enough humanity to make him likable. They should have kept on with our little peep show into the underbelly of tv entertainment, without trying to go all social justice warrior on us. One of the other user critics put it best "why does everything have to be an after school special?" WE GET IT : casting couch -bad , hard work and talent - good.....PROBLEM ! When open casting produces a line around the block and any who makes it is either connected or rich, you will never , ever have a meritocracy in a field where you get tons of money and adulation doing something fun and easy that EVERYONE WANTS TO DO.
So take your pick : vapid actress gets the job because Daddy is a big producer , or vapid actress gets the job because she DOES the big producer . You will never make it fair no matter what .-
The subplots were OK, until they go all public service announcement re parenting , etc. the director has a 16 year old daughter and the message they give us is : "she gets to do whatever she wants , parents just give her money ". She had a "Joan Jett " look and seems entitled to , well, everything although she is capable of contributing, well , nothing ....
The loveable Ruth and the director rescue the show w good acting and relatable angst, and they almost save the show from itself. But , alas, it is not to be and it devolved into a lifetime Network piece , complete w bad stereotypes of men and laughable portrayal of addiction . Nice try but, they dropped the pop up to right field like a drama club kid in PE class in the 80s; Next time, don't bother suiting up.... Glow is simply delightful. <br/><br/>If you are not familiar to feminism or doesn't know what it stands for, this show is the perfect way to learn a little bit about it and enjoy yourself at the same time.<br/><br/>This series is so political, yet so subtle. It achieves something Girls, OITNB and many others were unable to: it is so feminist without ever trying too hard or rubbing it in your face. They never exaggerate the events, but they successfully deliver women's empowerment. <br/><br/>Glow also provides excellent screen writing and performances. All the characters are charming and the plot is rich in both funny and bittersweet moments. <br/><br/>I will not get deeper into it, because I believe everyone should watch it for themselves. Glow is definitely a must! Obviously many people watched the first few episodes and felt very differently from me, but I gave this show a chance and could not understand its purpose. No one in the show is likable or interesting, and the show seems to objectify women just as much as it "sides" with them. I really found no reason to care what was happening to who. There are definitely some funny moments, but they are only brief solace in what is otherwise a slog. Because the show is so worth it! Incredibly sharp and fun writing. I have never thought I would enjoy anything wrestling-related, but here I am. I was a bit unsure about this show at first. The plot and basic concept are unusual to say the least. However, after watching all three available seasons, I can say unequivocally that this is one of the best shows Netflix has produced. It is witty, whimsical, clever and raw. It begins as the story of struggling actresses who take desperate roles as female wrestlers, and culminates into a show that explores the depth of humanity in all of its aspects. Not to mention it has the lovable and unbeatable flair that only comes with the spirit of the 80s. Other than a few misfire episodes, and slow starters, this show is a 10/10 and I would recommend nature audiences give it a try! I'm a Alison Brie fan and love her range in this show. I also live the outfits, hair, and makeup; all an homage to the 80s. Which is great foe r this series that's "loosely" based on real life GLOW show of the 80s.
I've never been a huge wrestling fan, but my grandma was so this show makes me smile and remember her.
Back to Alison Brie. The chemistry between her and Marc Maron is scintillating, keeps you at the edge of your seat to see what happens next. S1 & S2 built on this. S3 threw it all away. S3 has little to no wrestling, way too much Betty Gilpin for my taste, and 3/4 of an episode on Brie and Maron's relationship. I'm skeptical for S4. I started watching Glow for 80's neon visuals, cheesy fashion, and awesome music; I stayed for the endearing characters, fascinating drama, and a handful of belly laughs. Alison Brie and Marc Maron are amazing in their range and comedic skill, and the supporting cast are all very strong in their presence. It's also amazing how much actors put into learning wrestling moves to look convincing. I highly recommend. It's a rare TV series that can balance campiness, character development, relationships, and do it all with mature intelligence. GLOW threads this needle perfectly. I had low expectations for the show, and my wife was skeptical, but GLOW sucked us both in. The steady hand in the show is the director character (Marc Maron), who plays a jerk so naturally I started to yell back at him whenever his chauvinism was on display. That each episode packs in so much in only 30 minutes is testament to the very smart scripting, top-notch acting from *all* the characters, and, I believe, the fact that this show was an opportunity for a female ensemble to carry a show, which had to have ratcheted up the commitment from the actresses a notch or two.<br/><br/>GLOW is a perfect summer show. I love the show. I love the actors, I love the writing, and I love how generally positive it is.
I am a bit sad so many people are disappointed with Season 03, but for my part I loved it as much as the first 2 seasons.
I can only hope for more! I gave this a 9 only because perfection does not exist.<br/><br/>And I have to admit, I started watching this very reluctantly. What drew me in was Alison Brie, knowing her great voice acting on BoJack Horseman. But I've grown weary of the political trend in Hollywood. And many reviews made me want to skip this, some claiming it was full of acerbic feminism and misandry.<br/><br/>It's not. Instead, it's one of the most powerful dramatic series I've come across recently. All the actors shine, the stellar performances of Brie and Maron in particular. Every character is explored, and no one is outed as being "bad". Instead, you see a lot of development. The characters are surprising and show many faces, often revealing very surprising new sides of themselves - good and bad.<br/><br/>Some people complain it's still a series where the women are ultimately saved by men. It's not. There are no damsels in distress. Instead, the focus is far more on the men knowing they could and should be better to women and finding themselves painfully aware of their shortcomings. In fact, it's very often women saving men.<br/><br/>GLOW is about characters, but very much relationship-driven. Uncompromisingly, it is shown how no one exists in his or herself alone, and how important other people are in our development, particularly in the Ruth-Sam dynamic.<br/><br/>GLOW is simply drama at its best - with a very pleasant amount of comedy. Just watch this and don't be afraid of what the naysayers proclaim about it being merely the next piece of Hollywood propaganda. Heartfelt, hilarious, kinda crazy but all-in-all an awesome show! I watch a lot of tv & movies and this is probably on my list of fave Netflix originals. Just watch it, its so much more and more. The girls look and act the part fantastically, watched both series back to back, cried when it was over, I want to take up wrestling now as a homage to the girls, the 80s look totally wicked, the clothes, the music, the hair etc. Looking forward to the 3rd series, bring it on! Love this series! This season was a little too much agenda pushed. Mark Maron is awesome! All the cast is great. Look forward to next season. Finale was Christmas, really? Seasons 1 and 2 were actually decent but season 3 goes full on unfunny and why? Why is everyone saying it's different and not as fun because they have to hammer the PC line into the show. America is filled with racists, you should be ashamed unless you are an immigrant. The hilarious thing is
1. the show proves how diverse the country has always been in big cities like LA hence the diverse cast<br/><br/>2. The immigrants of the 80s and years before that have the american children of today which is why we should be for America first which everyone can be a part of as long as you are a legal citizen.<br/><br/>They ruined another show. Yes season 3 sucks but know why it sucks and stop endorsing this nonsense that wants to rob you of common unity and make you self-loathing for a problem that doesn't exist. This is not a systemically racist country. We have the most generous immigration policy in the world and some of the strictest laws against racism in the world. Get a life and learn to appreciate and love where you are living out your one precious life. I can't recommend investing the 10+ hours in the two seasons. This could have made a fantastic 1 1/2 or 2 hour movie, but as a series I don't think it worked. It was like going through all of the raw movie footage with no editing. I didn't realize at first this series was based on a true story. I found a documentary on Netflix about the real life GLOW, and I think I enjoyed watching the series more after seeing the documentary. But after watching the documentary, I was wondering when they would get to the real GLOW show? It took them almost the entire two seasons. Were there fun aspects and compelling characters along the way? Yes. That's why I fought my way to keep watching. But it just took way too long to get there.<br/><br/>This would have a R rating with some nudity and lots and lots of F words, and lots and lots of drug use. They did keep the nudity under control though.<br/><br/>The director Sam's character of snorting coke and saying the F word constantly while yelling at the women who were actually making a better show got pretty old to me after awhile. <br/><br/>I thought it was fun seeing the 80's period piece with the high jeans and big hair and gigantic pre-cell phones. There were also moments where people could relate to the #metoo movement with the casting couch.<br/><br/>Overall though, I just can't recommend investing the time. I wish they would have made a movie instead and edited it down. It did make me want to see if I could find the original GLOW shows. The concept itself was fun and something different, which is why I took a chance watching. A shout out to Britt Baron, who I thought had a stand out performance as Justine. This series loosely based on the ladies wrestling promotion in the 80's o the same name is a great watch. This is due to the team working on it who as seen with Orange Is The New Black and balance humour with tragedy and although this mainly has humour there are some great character driven roles in the top level cast. If you love wrestling from it boom years in the 80's you will enjoy this self referencing show ans is a who's who of current performers from Kia (Awesome Kong- Kharma) Stevens playing Tamme Dawson aka Welfare Queen to many other more recent stars. The action is crisp, the dialogue snappy and its been left open to a further series. If you enjoy uplifting TV about the struggle and redemption this is the one for you. What a show !!!
Fresh,innovative,funny,sad,clever,excellent actresses and actors,
excellent creators,excellent script,excellent depiction of an era,
excellent music,excellent direction.<br/><br/>Stand out performances by Betty Gilpin,Alison Brie and Marc Maron.<br/><br/>Liz Flahive and Carly Mensch you are amazing,
thank you.<br/><br/>A big fan from Greece... When this show came out - I had no interest in checking it out. However, the high critical reviews eventually convinced me to watch the first episode.<br/><br/>Wow - this is not what I was expecting!<br/><br/>It is so well acted and the characters are so fascinating that you can't help but be drawn in. I was especially impressed to see Alison Brie from Community showing amazing acting prowess in a whole new light. Marc Maron, who plays the gritty director, is perfectly cast and the most fun to watch.<br/><br/>Seasons 1 and 2 are the best so far. The plot line from episode to episode is twisty and fun. But if that doesn't win you over, the witty dialog is equally enjoyable. Plus, I loved all the high-energy 80s music!<br/><br/>Season 3 is a bit of hit and miss - mostly miss. That bumped down my rating a couple of points. It slows down a lot and we don't see Marc Maron as much ... which is unfortunate. Instead we get a lot of bizarre character storylines. Why did the writers alter from a successful formula?<br/><br/>Interestingly, there really was GLOW wrestling circuit in the 80s. For me, that added to the intrigue of the show.<br/><br/>All in all, this is great gem of show with a lot of heart, clever dialog and fun characters. The first two seasons are definitely worth checking out. Season 1 was funny and touching. Season 2 was fingernails on a chalkboard. Very disappointed. I highly doubt I'll ba back for season 3. This is another series that is somewhat entertaining but predictable and undeveloped that we see a lot of today. Show some skin in the first episode to draw the guys in, create a light hearted drama about the underdogs against the apparently unfeeling, ignorant power brokers who, if not for their conservative,money grubbing capitalist ways could just see the intrinsic value of the poor hard working saps who bring art to this world...Throw in an unforgettable, but unrelated scene where our poor protagonist has to be driven, quite helpless (because even though she's funny, sexy and talented, has no friends)to get her abortion by the creepy director. It's fun but that's about it and I don't think it deserves that ratings that it has gotten here. It goes to show, though, how hard great story telling is. Characters are unknowable and shallow. It's the inevitable consequence of a strong cultural and political bias of the writer. Even Ronald Reagan is even trotted out as a villain, and the hip 50 something cocaine addict director is lionized. That's how they all did it in Hollywood, folks! I can't tell you how sick I am of cliché in any story telling, and the cliché wrought upon all the characters in this show would be hard to cut with a razor sharp knife (Hey, more cliché!) Watch any episode of American Horror Story, The Sapranos, Breaking Bad, Boardwalk Empire or the Wire who do deserve these kind ratings. This is brain in cruise control stuff, which even I enjoy time to time. I really like the show. All three seasons were amazing, i like how we got to know the other characters in s3. DO NOT MAKE SAM GO AWAY AGAIN. I wasn't happy about that.<br/><br/>It's amazing and it sends a positive message out. Keep doing that, but do not forget the comedic aspect of the show There has been a lot, but really a lot of advertising of this show in Barcelona. Some streets were even wallpapered with small posters of the show (I even snatched one for myself LOL). And even though sometimes the hype is too big and then the show is not as good as we thought, but fortunately, this is not the case!<br/><br/>This show is really cool. Firstly, it's set up in the 80s, an age we all feel nostalgic, whether we lived it or not. Secondly, it's from the creators of Orange is the New Black and you can feel it in the air that it has the same scene. At some point you might think it's kind of copy just that instead of being them in a prison, they are on a ring, but it's not the case as this show shines with its own light. Thirdly, there is the cast. Each one of the girls is played by a brilliant actress that gives their best performance. In my case, I really like Debbie, I find that Betty Gilpin does a marvelous performance of this character. Lastly, but not last, there is the music. Of course it's always a music according to the age we are, and it even makes feel you more nostalgic if possible.<br/><br/>We follow Ruth's character taking a patch on this new stage in her life and in every episode we learn not only more things about her but also about the other ladies. Why are doing this, what they want to be. Each episode with a wonder music surrounding us and each episode taking the story one step ahead. The only pity is that every episode only lasts about 32min, and you will feel in the mood for more and more, so it's a brilliant excuse to binge watch the series in a single day. But then you will feel like you need more, and more, and then before you realize it the show is over. After hearing good things about Glow, I gave it a watch only to find it even better than I thought it would be. After the pilot I was already hooked on it. Having Chavo Guerrero Jr on set to make sure the correct wrestling terminology was used was a great choice for this series. The humor is dark at times and overall entertaining with an engaging story and characters. The old school style was captured perfectly, including the excellent soundtrack. Bonus cameos from wrestlers which fans of wrestling will enjoy also.<br/><br/>Overall a very well done series, highly recommend this series. Well I made it through 1.75 episodes. <br/><br/>I love the genre, the clothes, hair and so on. But this played out like a badly acted soap opera. I think that Alison Brie is great! as well as some other actors.<br/><br/>But Marc Maron, whom I have liked in the past, until he got too bitchy whiney, is way over the top. <br/><br/>The plot lines are ridiculous, and I just cannot justify spending any more of my time on this, too many other great shows. <br/><br/>Such as American Patriot for one. I had to edit my review. I'm sick of Hollywood getting political and come to find out, Marc Maron and Betty Gilpin are two actors so far that can't keep their politics to themselves. They completely ruined the show for me. <br/><br/>Also, I highly recommend everyone reading this to watch the actual documentary of Glow on Netflix. The documentary makes this fabricated show look like poop because it didn't take one ounce of creatvity to make it. Reality is 10x better! Every bit as entertaining and funny as season one GLOW continues to mix outlandish humour with drama concerning very real issues and largely gets the balance spot on This could have been a great show but too many things are absolutely not working from my point of view and I felt completely disconnected after a few episodes. Is this a comedy? a drama? a satire of Hollywood? It seems like the director and the producer disagreed on the general tone of the series and both tried to push for their views. So the end result is inconsistent both in general atmosphere and in the story line.<br/><br/>Quickly you don t really understand what s at stake or why certain scenes were included in the final cut. Many side stories start at some point and fall away without being developed afterwards, such as the affair between the director and the trainer. What was the point? What s also the point on the She Wolf episode and why does she become nice to Ruth when she calls her wolf (...but why?). And there are a lot of other examples of undeveloped side stories, inconsistencies, or even ridiculous situations (when the wrestling champion comes to pick up his daughter, she pretends to be in a couple with the producer. The scene does not even work for a second)<br/><br/>The back story of the main character (poor but seemingly talented young actress trying to break through in Hollywood) is meaningless after two episodes. At some point she becomes just some sort of clown with a fake Russian accent and the connection with the character is lost. <br/><br/>One of the big disappointment was also the visual aspect of the show. You expect something flashy and colorful, but 90% of the episodes are shot in a grey and dirty warehouse! You also barely get to see wrestling scenes. I understand that they are training and cannot wear fluorescent spandex all the time but a bit of light in this dullness would have been welcome. <br/><br/>Overall not worth watching. It is a relatively entertaining show with some LOL moments. And I enjoyed the 80s aspects although as the show progressed they had some misses. Some story lines worked, some did not. I would have scored it higher but in some of the later episodes the writers felt the need to add their political views, add in an unnecessary abortion at PP and attack the Reagans, conservatives etc. We watch movies to escape life not to be preached to and have liberal views forced down our throats. It really ruined the series. This was OK, somewhat interesting. But, it could have been so much better. Kind of disappointed considering all the hype. The writing is kind of lackluster but the acting elevates it. It really did not feel like the 80s either. Hopefully the second season, if it is renewed, will be better. I will continue watching for now. I never watched wrestling and I probably never will. I just don't find it entertaining. Still, I do appreciate that wrestling has some things going for it. I have enjoyed many stories about wrestling and GLOW is a great example.I think that most will see this as lighthearted entertainment. If you noticed a few negative reviews, they focused on what I perceived to be political or moral biases. I imagine a minority take issue with some scenes but I'd be surprised if many people would really be bothered by any content. Unique and real in the writing of characters. Imaginative and memorable performances! Clever and intelligent writing. Unique and diverse characters that are unapologetic in every respect. Male roles typical of every dastardly action they use in a male dominated field of TV. Bingeworthy for sure. I came to this show because of Marc Maron. I've followed him since the early years of his podcast, and even came out to see his standup a few times. What struck me about Maron is what strikes me about this series: An honest take on human psychology vis a vis real situational human circumstances.<br/><br/>A situational comedy on steroids.<br/><br/>I remember M*A*S*H making me tear up occasionally, but this mfer manages to make me cry at some point in every episode, especially Season 3.<br/><br/>A most unlikely favorite for me (I could give a crap about professional wrestling IRL,) but the writing and performances, and the *commitment* of the cast to the story is extremely moving and revelatory. I'm in love with everyone who worked on this drama. After the first episode I was already completely convinced. The characters are likeable, funny, fleshed out and given a very well done depth. You can't help but to completely adore the characters. The pace of the show also is very good and makes it not dragging at all which is appreciated. The direction and the cinematography is also great. Glow is just another hit for netflix. If you want to watch a funny show, a set of likeable characters, profound emotions and have a good time, then this is your show. Wow! I didn't have high expectations. I'm not a fan of wrestling nor drawn to plots geared towards women (not that I'm sexist - it's just not my kind of plot gimmick) and I only started watching this because Jenji Kohan has such a great track record. GLOW is no exception to the rule. I quickly found myself invested in the storyline, gripped by the characters, and engaged in the unexpected edge-of-the-seat action. This is in no way a typical dramedy or wrestling show, and does not have a gender-specific target audience. The 80's nostalgia was on point and I have a newfound appreciation for the wrestling genre after seeing it in a different light. But above all, it's just plain great storytelling and I'm eager to see a second season. I've never been interested in wrestling, but I love Marc Maron and took a chance on this. I am sooooo glad I did.<br/><br/>This show is about so much more than just the wrestling, and covers a lot of important issues. I don't want to say too much because of potential spoilers, but let me just say that I have thoroughly enjoyed this show. The main characters are very well fleshed out and come across as real people, and the character development throughout the two seasons has been phenomenal. I've been watching it slowly because I want to savor it; great TV like this doesn't come along every day.<br/><br/>There should be some kind of award for best casting, and whoever cast this show should get that award. The performances are almost universally perfect, and I've found myself engaged by all of the various story lines, but to me the real stand out star here is Alison Brie. I liked her before I saw her in this show, but her performance here has cemented her position as my current favorite actress. She conveys a warmth and vitality of spirit that I have to believe are genuinely a part of her. From now on I'll watch anything with her in. She is also almost casually hilarious .<br/><br/>Marc Maron does a great job in a part that seems almost written specifically for him. Betty Gilpin does a phenomenal job portraying her character's growth and struggles, and like pretty much everyone else on the show is very sympathetic.<br/><br/>In the end I fell in love with a show about wrestling when I don't even like wrestling. That should tell you something. Not even some great 80's tunes can save this dog of a show. If you want proof that networks are starved for content, this is it. Both lead actors have been terrific in other things, but even they can't save this. Horrible dialogue, dismal directing, offensive content, clumsy attempts at humor, and scenery chewing accents; this has it all. I gave it several episodes, which add up to precious time in my life that I can never get back. I'm writing this as a favor to the rest of you who still have time to save yourselves. I wish I could give it ten Minus stars! In the first season nothing happens. It's the same training gags, montage type deals,
Money problem and an infidelity sub plot. Way too much content. I mean no spoilers but that's the whole season with the everyone pick on Ali tone. This should be 6 ep seasons. Ali Brie is insanely over rated as an actress. If you're a fan of this show can u really picture the way she acts as a successful wresltler in real life? I get that it's supposed to be funny, but there's so many other actresses who should've had this role over her; they could done something body positive and more realistic, and simply have 
Been good. There's no one talking about that tho, just hating on people who just honestly review shows & movies like this that use social justice as marketing, pushing something like an all female cast before substance. Brie would be laughed out of the ring portraying a real GLOW, watch the doc on Netflix if you don't believe me. it's terrible casting, but they took the "big name" instead of actually doing something socially progressive by casting someone body positive, Bc using a female cast in a show based on a real ladies wrestling association is super Brave on its own. Essentially it tried 
 too hard to push the "look how well we pulled off the all female cast!" Instead of using the potential of the concept, Bc it could've been amazing. Honestly, people will hate on my review for sure, but I'monly being honest, I was super disappointed with the lack of anything happening in he first season. I did not fancy this at all but I was really pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>This is not only very funny but very clever indeed.
I am a big fan of Alison Bree from "Community" but she metamorphos for this role so much I did not even recognise her here.
Her performance absolutely smashes it out of the park!
I was also amazed to see Kate Nash on the line up who easily holds her own.
Marc Maron's character is hilarious as a sexist, washed-up, burnt-out director.
What really makes this though is the supporting cast who are epic - every last one of them.<br/><br/>There are obviously strong currents of feminism and racism but I found they actually added to the story and were though provoking rather than making this a platform to preach from.<br/><br/>There is bad language, nudity and some sex scenes but everything is handled in an adult way but with great skill and wit.<br/><br/>I was expecting to hate this, I don't know why I put it on but am so glad I did.<br/><br/>Great performances, good story, very funny script.
Love it!! Overall, this series had great quirky humor and a fantastic premise! The music, hair, makeup and costumes were genius as well; there were a couple of slower moving plot lines that took away from it's entertainment but that's not unheard of for a first season. What was troubling, or more accurately, downright nauseating was the distasteful and horrifying scene in which a character satires miscarriage after learning that another character has experienced one. There is no place for this kind of insensitivity and I can honestly say the last time i was this queasy watching any movie/show was during District 9 and that was for very different reasons. Incredibly disappointed in the people responsible for allowing a scene like that to be written AND acted and not cutting it for it's obvious callous disregard for it's foul nature. First off, I enjoyed watching GLOW, even as a non-American, non wrestling fan. I personally rate things harsher than most, with 10s almost never given out and 9s very rarely, so my 7 would be most people's 8, meaning I actually like it pretty well.<br/><br/>Most of the show's highlights are covered extensively in the top rated reviews here, and I'm sure I have little to offer with regards to either the wrestling aspect of the story, or the overall 1980s nostalgia of the backdrop. Season 1 is well structured, focused and concise, and the two female leads both got plenty of chances to shine, which they absolutely did.<br/><br/>My main complaint lies with one particular aspect of season 2: I feel that not only is Ruth slightly underused in season 2, which is still somewhat understandable, given the addition of new characters/newly explored relationship dynamics, but also that when Ruth is given screentime, she's misused in certain episodes.<br/><br/>The only time Alison Brie was truly put to test as a dramatic actress (not talking about the wrestling action scenes) in Season 2, happened after Liberty Belle breaks her foot, when the two of them argued bitterly in her hospital room. In most episodes, she's just a supporting character with one vastly overused and annoying gimmick aka her Russian accent. The narrative thread swings wildly throughout the season and needs some focusing. I get it that the producers probably consider this as an ensemble cast, but since GLOW isn't a sitcom like The Big Bang Theory where little narrational continuity is required between one episode and the next, I can't be the only prolific film/TV buff who would like a little more focus on the central characters.<br/><br/>Also, like with the final season of The Office, I completely disagree with the writers' choice of a so called romantic interest for the top billed character. In the Office's case, after Steve Carell left, they spent the entire final third of the penultimate season building Andy and Erin as a true-love in waiting couple, with Andy chasing her all the way to Miami to win her back in typical Hollywood romcom fashion to end the season. This seemd such a perfect end to their on-and-off struggle to accept each other over the years, only for the show to completely ruin his character in the final season (granted there was the writer change and Ed Helm's schedule conflict) and ruining their relationship. After Erin dumped Andy, I stopped caring about the story because it was such a disappointing betrayal to what the writers themselves spent so much time and effort to build.<br/><br/>In GLOW's case, especially after the obvious reference to the MeToo movement in one of the earlier episodes where Ruth was sexually harassed by the TV exec, I actually felt bad for Sam when he tried to kiss Ruth in the formal in ep 9 and Ruth rejected and then literally ran away. What was that? They're doing a fine job with Sam's redemption arc up to that point. Straight after, at the end of the ep, Ruth tries to visit the camera guy's house uninvited, in clutches, and tries to climb dangerously tall flight of stairs alone. This is both corny and cliche, not to mention unrealistic and is the result when writers plan the key events over an entire season and then writes the story to fit this structure.<br/><br/>Finally, even if you simply had to have Ruth and the camera guy together by this point, what's so special about him? Anyone with half a brain can see that Ruth is the most talented of the whole bunch, so talented (and very beautiful) that the whole back story of her being 'completely unsuccessful as an actress her entire career before GLOW and remained an undiscovered nobody' beggars belief. If the camera guy is in any way an interesting character at all, then how come I can't even remember his name after binge watching the entire season? Would you cast someone like him, or write a character like him, as the male lead of a romcom or a romance story at all? To summarize, I care about Ruth's character development a great deal simply because I think it has potential to be the best part of the story and that I think she is the soul of GLOW. Ruth is supposed to be the central character of the show that holds the rest of the pieces together, at least that's what I gathered from watching season 1, and I feel that Alison Brie's considerable talent is being underused here in the 2nd season.<br/><br/>She's also an amazing voice actor, which I'm sure the creators of the show are well aware of, but they seriously need to explore more intersting venues of her character to add more depth, instead of endlessly recycling the Zoya thing. This is also why my least favorite episode from season 1 was where Ruth went to a party with the motel manager pretending to be Russian. I'm not Russian or Eastern European but seriously, Russian accents are not funny and gets tiring really quick, especially since we already had Borat 13 years ago for that gimmick, tone it down a notch when she's off stage.<br/><br/>I understand the need for variety over the course of a season, but even relationshp dramas need a little focus and continued character development, or you'll end up with the later seasons of TBBT. All said I still find enough parts of GLOW interesting enough to look forward future season(s). Original GLOW fan here. I have been over the moon about this since I saw the trailer. I was so disappointed. The first two episodes put me to sleep. The show is flat and boring and tries too hard. While the humor is low grade and predictable, there are a few chuckles here and there and the music is good. Even if everything else was great, I can't get behind a lead character who cheats with her best friend's husband. saw promo for this show and remembered seeing GLOW late night on Detroit TV when I was a boy and thought why not give it a try and I will say the show was engrossing and very watchable. the characters are engrossing and great for binge watching which I did. the acting and interaction of the characters are sensational and I wish network TV would produce good shows like this and this is why Netflix is viewing for the future such as hbo. This shows SPITS ON THE FACE OF THE ORIGINAL GLOW.<br/><br/>HORRIBLE characters "female empowerment?" Hardly Making up FAKE characters based on REAL characters who were 100X better A watered down version of something real.<br/><br/>It's SAD if you think this is any good because it means you can't tell real from fake and REAL is ALWAYS better than fake Review for season 1 of "Glow":<br/><br/>Why would someone cheat with the husband of their best friend, and can this friendship be repaired?<br/><br/>This is the question Netflix series "Glow" asks its audience from episode one, while also asking its viewers if they would like to see attractive women wearing 80s highcut leotards powerslam each other in the wrestling ring.<br/><br/>Safe to say, "Glow" presents a winning combination of rarely visited, real dramatic tension (can a cherished friendship survive one of the deepest betrayals, adultery?) and compelling wrestling imagery. It also shows us some of the probable realities of wrestling theatre, what our friends really meant when they asked us "Did you know pro wrestling is fake?" And finally, "Glow" gives us a wealth of politically incorrect humor, such as in Zoya the Destroyer and Welfare Queen.<br/><br/>I would say "Glow" is more than a guilty pleasure. It's more than cheese. It's often intelligent, unconventional and has meaningful things to say, However, I will say that it often drags. Probably like a third of each episode is devoted to other characters of the wrestling team and their backstories, and as they are apart from the main conflict I'm interested in (the adultery), I was not invested. I did stop watching eventually. But I will say that the unapologetically seedy character of Sam Sylvia (as played by Marc Maron) is one of my favorite characters to date. Mensch and Flahive have created an ingenious comedy series. What a trip down memory lane for fans of wrestling during the 80's. This series has excellent direction, writing, cinematography, soundtrack and acting. Brie, Gilpin and Maron in particular stand out and deliver superlative performances. Although the show explores the exploitation of women, it is the actresses in this series that are the strength behind the entire plot. It's so refreshing to be cheering for women in lead roles. Even the development of Maron's character over the first two seasons gives reason to applaud. This show is a marvelous ode to the gorgeous ladies of wrestling and a pleasure to view. Without these groundbreaking women perhaps other future breakthroughs would have not occurred in this medium. This series is bravura and at the top in it's genre. Watch . enjoy.
80s spandex . 
well rounded characters. rarely do you get this in an original series. Laugh out loud riot of a show very clever writing and character development! Acting is superb! Music is so good you will sing along. Costume and makeup is spot on!! If I say one more time I had that!! It feels exactly like you have been swept back in time. I'm hooked! I loved the retro feel and the closer look at women's wrestling, which i never really cared about before. The acting is great, but overall the was quite boring to me and I didnt like the lgbtq representation, which showed gay people as some predatory people who hit on every person of their gender or straight up assault them. Really? Episode 1 comes off like something a bunch of 50 year old guys think feminism looks like. It's a terrible script with lackluster direction; lots of men saving women, women betrayed (who will eventually be allies) and some weird 'what it was like in the sexy 80's' (but wasn't) vibe. UGH.<br/><br/>The only reason I gave it 3 stars was the performances of the women- particularly Brie & Gilpin.<br/><br/>What were you thinking, Netflix? Based on glowing reviews, I assumed that GLOW would light up the screen and I could bask in a some brilliant entertainment. But no, the lead is a dim bulb. And a bad person to boot. Sorry if you sleep with your bestie's spouse, you're not redeemable. I enjoyed Alison Brie in Community and thought this would be a hoot to watch.<br/><br/>Perhaps I can not relate to the 80s vibe since I wasn't around then, but this show feels very forced. I see a lot of reviews praising how empowering it is. But sorry I don't see much empowering in a bunch of posers play fighting.<br/><br/>No thanks, one is better off watching actual 80s comedies. This is too contrived and I have no interest in rooting for a one note lead. I have never been a fan of wrestling or any kind of physical movement done in a ring. This show is really something. It's funny. It's flamboyant. Alison Brie has really grown as an actress and a comedic performer and I while watching the show I got the impression that she got slimmer and prettier since Community. <br/><br/>That said, there are moments throughout that will make anyone laugh, boy or girl, old or young. Also, some uplifting scenes, a lot of cool characters and wrestling. It's not surprising that the show takes place in the 80s, the golden era of wrestling. The casting is great. A lot of different types of women combine to an interesting melting pot of estrogen. 6.8/10. This was a real surprise for me: a Hollywood comedy with bite, great writing and superb acting from the principals - Brie, Maron, Gilpin. The biggest joy comes from the moments of real human interaction, a true rarity from an American comedy. The only weak spots are perhaps Kate Nash's character which seems hollow and the Justine character who would have rocked played by Aubrey Plaza of a few years ago. Small complaints. However, after finishing the last episode I had an uncomfortable feeling that this show was written by a couple of trust fund teens sitting around their mom's Beverly Hills pool, making fun of the maid, pool cleaner and other around-the-mansion help. While the duo successfully skewers 80's stereotypes (black angry woman, black welfare queen, Arab terrorist with machine gun, the KKK, officious Asian etc), it also presents these character groups as needy and stupid, requiring rescue by the flawed by super intelligent and benevolent Brie and Maron characters. All this accompanied by a dozen or so inside Jewish culture jokes, a precious Brie interpretation of a song from "Yentl" and even more adorable Brie Hasidic Jew. With a little more balance and credit for intellect among other races and types, this could be an even more substantial piece of work. In this era of Trump, how many Americans can tell that this is largely a satire? But that's the small stuff. I laughed at all the jokes - even the ones that made we wince - and felt rewarded by the more touching human elements. Looking forward to a equally savage but more even-handed second season. Season Two was very bland and lame compared to Season One. The set-up of the show was tremendous but it's turned into CHEERS with female wrestling. The uptight classy girl slumming to be taken seriously among "real people" and the cool boss, both hinting at a romance, isn't intriguing since the man is a gross coke addict, and it's better that he can't stand the pretentious girl since that makes his character funny.<br/><br/>Hell, even the worst seasons of Cheers had Sam and Diane in love with each other. And if GLOW is heading in that direction, too bad. Because Season One, pitting two polar opposite girls against each other... one who cheated with the other's husband... was fantastic, and everything else fell into place. Now it's at a standstill. There are enough romantic comedies out there. I saw the trailer and thought it looked good especially since it was produced by the same people that made orange is the new black. However as soon as I started watching it...I had high hopes but was disappointed within two episodes. Although I thought to myself maybe the next episode will be better. Wrong. I did however watch all the shows and on the last episode I had to forward to the end because it couldn't end fast enough. I bet the real life GLOW was much better. To the producers if you're reading this, keep on with orange is the new black because this show, GLOW IS GARBAGE. Im not recommending this show to my friends unless they need some good background noise. That is all. I watched the first 4 episodes of season 1. Then i stopped to watch it. I found it very boring. No funny at all, no exciting also. It is a parody of a show of 80s but for my opinion it is a boring parody. Not an interesting plot, not a breath-catching performance. if there was a 0 stars rate... that my rate would be. I like wrestling and I like gorgeous ladies. This does have wrestling... Jokes aside Allison Brie and her friend are both good looking. If you think that shouldn't matter don't name your TV show gorgeous ladies of wrestling. I usually find Marc Maron a bit irritating, but, in this he is actually quite funny. Some characters are interesting and likable, others aren't. The story has a clear and direct arc. The overall premise is great for a TV show, but, some of the minor characters are gross and or boring. There is also the odd SJW propaganda forced in there like, republicans are evil, abortion is great, women can do anything men can and minorities are stereotyped. It really gets in the way of what could have been an awesome show. The title is brilliant, just make it happen. Get some gorgeous ladies, get a clean sparkly arena. Ridiculous gimmicks and story lines, lots of conflict on and off stage. 80s music and clothes lots of sex and drugs. Done. Instant hit. Girls would love it cause of girl power and all that $hit and men would love pretty girls in spandex fighting. If you know wrestling it is too ECW and not enough WWF or WCW. ECW being cheap and underground works because it is so rough and hardcore. With this it is cheap and underground without the hardcore bad ass aspect. Women couldn't pull that off anyway. No one wants to see women actually beating the $hit out of each other with weapons. Overall, the premise has a lot of potential, but, the execution leaves a lot to be desired. Season 2 could be good if they ditched the $hit characters, brought in some hot girls and gave the crew a proper budget. I don't think they will though. I hate you Netflix. I gotta admit that first episodes are entertaining yet somehow I wasn't that interested in the show until the chemistry and the characters began to grow and it started to get better, until season 2 arrived and I was blown away.
I have learned so much about women partnership from this series than anything else out there. I love this show and I can't wait for season 3 Great continuation of the quality from S1. Feels like the screenplay evolved naturally telling each characters story. Again Glow does a great job in not wasting your time with filler episodes. One particularly fantastic episode was dedicated to a full meta 'GLOW episode'! Genius stuff. I have fallen in love with the characters and setting, after such a great run with S1&S2 I sincerely hope this show keeps the same staff and maintains this exceptional quality Pretty girls, 80's background, great acting, great music. Unbelievable. Way better than like "Friends" or "Cheers" or whatever. This is the real deal. This is what TV should be about. I don't want it to end!
I haven't been able to watch any tv series in years cause of the cliche acting and predictable storylines. BUT GLOW IS FRESH!
It is smart, joyful, sad, on the brink of madness and cleverness, tickles my heart and brain. I WANT MORE OF THIS STUFF!<br/><br/>THANK YOU ALL FOR GLOW. This is a great show about a guy starting an all woman wrestling league that's set in the 80's. In the show you get to know the characters and their back story Why is Glow TV showing past episodes instead of continuing the series? Episodes 1-9: set-up, breasts, half-hearted training.<br/><br/>Episode 10: great choreographed wrestling & costumes.<br/><br/>If you've only got 30 minutes, go for the finale. Otherwise, fast-forward thru the beginning. I enjoyed some of the character development, particularly Britannica and Sam. It looks like they've left wiggle room for a sequel. This is A League of Their Own done for TV. Meaning it is slow. Something does happen, but if you skip episodes there is nothing missing. And there is nothing feminist in a show where women mimic men, the same way there is nothing empowering when a large group of women get to impose their will to a loser director, and seldom. And to keep the audience up each episode seems to be spiced up with the breasts of one of the actresses. Probably they will change the cast when the stock of unseen breasts is over. Nothing empowering there either.<br/><br/>Contact me with Questions, Comments or Suggestions ryitfork @ bitmail.ch But I finally watched and it's amazing !! Great characters , actors , and writing ! The second season can't start soon enough ! My wife wanted to watch this show . I was dead set against it . I've never been happier to be wrong about a show . Must see ! This was a surprising gem of a show. I knew Marc Maron was a great podcast host, but I never suspected he would be this good as an actor. He is perfectly cast in this series.<br/><br/>Speaking of perfectly cast, Alison Brie is fantastic in the lead role. Her character can sometimes be painful to watch, but she plays the part in just the right way.<br/><br/>The entire ensemble cast is great. Some of the characters can come across as over the top, but that's kind of the whole point.<br/><br/>Give it a watch, you'll be glad you did. I live in a region where the original women from the 80s did not air, so I had no idea they existed. After bingeing on this series, I just had to see more. Netflix has an excellent documentary with the original players. I recommend that as well, if you have not seen it. The series does a nice job of blending the true stories of the original players with the invented story line of the fictionalized version. No more Netflix for me nothing good anymore on there since 2016 First of all, I got to say that the show is much fun and I liked to watch a lot. But, I hated to see a Netflix tv series that does not check for facts before making the show! Lebanon is a Mediterranean country, we have 0% of deserts! People in Lebanon mostly look like Italians or spanish people, they are no way having darker skin as some Gulf countries. I have nothing against dark skin or dry, hot climates! I just get offended when American television stereotypes all Arab speaking countries to Saudi Arabia! Or shockingly India! (Which is not even in the Middle East)<br/><br/>It is highly offensive to wipe up a whole country, costumes and cultures and put them under another country stereotypes to sell your show!
We in Lebanon have our own culture that we are so proud of. If you want to show something about Lebanon make sure it is true before selling racist stereotypes. I'm not interested in wrestling at all. I always thought it was super tacky. This show made me care about something I straight up don't care about at all. The acting is outstanding and Ruth's actress is so talented. I thought Ruth would be too annoying to continue watching after a few episodes of season 1, but she grew on me. Give it a watch! This had been on my Netflix list for a couple of months now and I finally got around to watching it. What a pleasant surprise. I binged it over a couple of nights. Fun and light hearted but with some darker themes intertwined. Well worth a look. Glorious Ladies of Wresting is a fun story about showbiz and the lives of women in Los Angeles. Ruth Wilder (Alison Brie) is a struggling actress trying to find a fitting role for her ability She attends an audition for a wrestling group led by a sleazy director Sam Sylvia (Marc Maron). Low on money, Ruth is desperate for a gig, even showing up after Sam turns her away. She also has a relationship with Mark (Rich Sommer) but that turns out to be complicated. Her best friend Debbie Eagan (Betty Gilpin) is a former soap opera star and a new mother who also happens to be married to Mark. When Debbie shows up to beat down Ruth, Sam sees potential in the two actresses.<br/><br/>While the tension between the two main characters is central, there are a ton of other interesting characters that play wrestling characters as well. Leading the group is Cherry Bang (Sydelle Noel), she has a history with Sam and refuses to be cornered into a stereotype based on her race. Carmen Wade (Britney Young) is the daughter and sister of successful wrestlers who refuse to let her pursue her own career in the sport. Justine Biagi (Britt Baron) is a young punk rocker who has motives beyond wrestling. TammÃ© Dawson (Kia Stevens) a former actress and TV show host who plays the Welfare Queen as social commentary. Other characters use their race to critique the stereotype and stoke the anger of the ignorant wrestling crowds like Arthie Premkumar (Sunita Mani) as Beirut right during the Lebanese hostage crisis and Jenny Chey (Ellen Wong) as Fortune Cookie.<br/><br/>Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com I really liked the first couple of seasons of this show. The GLOW ladies actually wrestled, showed they were strong women, had great stories, and was an entertaining show. Season 3 was just really boring and bad. The show spends way too much time on social justice. I don't care about how these characters come from diverse backgrounds or the social justice issues. There is almost no good wrestling this season. Too much talking about boring issues! Also many of the ladies just go on and on about feminism and telling you women are strong and men suck. Yeah. . . great message since feminism is supposed to advocate for equality among men and women! Really made me dislike certain characters, especially in the boring episode where they go out and get lost in the desert. Hopefully season 4 does not continue this pattern. I've been an on and off fan of wrestling. 95% of the WWE product is trash, but it has it's great moments. Unfortunately you need to wait through that 95% of trash to get to the good stuff, so I don't watch it as I'd be wasting my time.<br/><br/>I randomly decided to watch this after hearing good stuff and had been meaning to since the first season originally came out.<br/><br/>It's got a bit of a slow start to it, but once you get past the 4th or so episode it really gets going and you will fall in love with all of these characters.<br/><br/>I get that it's got to set up the characters and overall story, but the first three episodes are just middle of the road. Luckily I stuck with it as it gets fantastic at the middle of the season.<br/><br/>If you're expecting a show about wrestling with a lot of wrestling, this might not be for you. This is a drama about a group of women who come together for many different reasons and form a friendship through a form of entertainment they all probably didn't like before then.<br/><br/>Each of the characters are something special, even ones you'd consider secondary each have their own side stories and different relationships with each other. There are two or three that get little to no development, but I guess in a series with 12+ characters, some have to fall by the wayside.<br/><br/>It's just a great show with deep and fantastic characters. The actual wrestling isn't the main draw, but it's really cool to see how these actors do it when there are sequences of it! I feel like everyone tried so hard. It's difficult to be harsh critiquing as one can see all the hard work that was put into this show. It just didn't quite come together.<br/><br/>I really do love all the actors and Marc is so funny and an amazing actor who I'd be curious to see in other roles. However, for me this show ruined it for everyone. No one can quite make it; except for lighting, Makeup&Hair, set design, costumes... which have done their work to an incredibly high standard - and that's actually the only reason I could keep watching the show (stopped watching on the S3 EP1). It's like a beautiful moving painting. But then, the storyline lacks clear direction and depth. It's hard to get attached to any of the characters. The secondary actors actually come across as more interesting than the main ones. I was forcing myself to watch it as my partner who worked in film rates it at a high standard - but I simply cannot understand where he finds the appeal. Alison Brie; I really loved her in Mad Men, such a strong character she embodied perfectly; above & beyond. In Glow I think she couldn't even be believable let alone create any empathy towards her character which is a shame as she is a brilliant actress.<br/><br/>In conclusion, technically extremely well executed show, however, lacking of any strong human connection and clear script direction thus not engaging enough for me. This year I've been watching a number of shows set in the 1980s: Stranger Things, Dark, Pose and GLOW*. This last one is a fictionalized account of a wrestling show from the era. Since I didn't grow up in the era, I don't know of the wrestling show, but GLOW is a fine show even if you don't know about wrestling. The characters, their personas, and their personal lives are something to behold. Definitely see it.<br/><br/>*Part of Jordan Peele's "Us" also takes place in the '80s. GLOW S02 was just as fun as S01, and though this third season of Netflix's GLOW (10 eps, 1/2 hr) was much different from the first two seasons, it was still very well put together. And we guys were rewarded with a good bit of R-rated enjoyment. We've waited patiently since its debut and were nicely rewarded over quite a few episodes, in fact. This season is based in Vegas, soooo. The creatives - producers, writers, directors, actors - contributing to this series are just doing a great job season after season, and the way they put together the final episode AND the final scenes...just have some Kleenex tissue on hand.
*** GLOW season 1: That was a fun little romp ***
This is an entertaining original dramedy series (10, 1/2hr eps) and it's got a second season so the fun continues. This is a "behind-the-production" look - though not a docu-series - at those poor souls involved in the launch of a third-tier, low-budget womens' wrestling tv show called "GLOW". There's a wild mix of characters in GLOW and it's always entertaining. I'm a software dev manager dude who rides a boss motorcycle to work, so trust me on this if you think this show isn't for you. The second season of Netflix's winning comedy-drama is just as good as the first. Expanding on the themes that were previously introduced and developed, the show manages to tap into the same tone and vibe of the first season from the first few minutes here, and it takes very little time to get re-acquainted with the show's many characters and intertwined storylines. Alison Brie remains compelling in the lead, and she's blessed with a terrific supporting cast of strong performers who have an evident respect for their own characters. The show's overall narrative arc develops and gels faster this time around, with each character having more to do and the finished result is an entirely satisfying ensemble comedy with a unique premise. The 80's was a time of excesses; too much hair, too much aqua net, too much makeup, too large shoulder pads, too much drugs, too big boomboxes, too many tights with high cut leotards and too much drama! This series is all of that more. The music brings the 80's vibes home. This show makes me laugh every episode. No other show like it! The opening episode draws you in with a great feeling of 80s nostalgia and the anticipation of great character development. Alison Brie is fantastic and loveable in the beginning, but for some reason they force you to hate her and the other characters are just contrived and predictable. When I watched episode 3 I felt like I had somehow skipped a few episodes. Bad reviews sometimes make me want to watch a show even more in order to see what is so bad about and there are plenty of good reviews to suggest this show is good. However based on episodes 2 and 3 I can only see this show going downhill. While I don't plan to watch any more of GLOW after seeing the pilot, it's not bad at all. It's just not all that compelling.<br/><br/>It's all cute enough. A struggling actress can only find work on a wrestling TV program, where she meets a variety of characters.<br/><br/>I suppose it's more a comedy than anything else, but not a particularly funny one. The only one who really gets any laughs is Marc Maron as the show's snarky producer. <br/><br/>To me it seems that if you've got a series mainly focused on women and the only interesting main character is a guy, there's an issue. The only female character that really made an impression was Sydelle Noel as a tough stunt double.<br/><br/>As for Alison Brie, the actual star of GLOW, she's fine. But that's about it. I don't feel her character is sharply drawn and her only emotion in the pilot is exasperation. I liked Brie a lot in Community, so she's certainly talented, but either she doesn't have a handle on the character or the writer doesn't. Because I have no real sense of her, or what she wants, or why she so eagerly embraces a role that is nothing she ever wanted.<br/><br/>But then, that's just the pilot. Perhaps her character is developed later. I don't know. The problem is, I don't care enough to find out. Except for Alison Brie. Her character and the actress herself are awful. Every sexless angry self righteous female character ever. Other than her the show is pretty good in short snippets. I feel sometimes I'm watching a 30 Rock version of a fake show about a show about wrestling. Basically it's Kimmy Schmidt without drag queens. Women and wrestling. What's not to love? This show captures the 80's perfectly. Awesome Kong. A Netflix original series, GLOW is a show based in the 80's about a struggling actress named Ruth Wilder (Alison Brie) who lands a role with dozens of other actresses in a wrestling promotion called GLOW (Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling) and is immediately at heads with the promoter Sam (Marc Maron) as he thinks she isn't fit for the role, then her best friend and soap opera actress Debbie (Betty Gilpin) comes in and that's my cue to stop talking about the plot. While at first, I was skeptical of this series since adapting wrestling on TV hasn't had much success, it exceeded my expectations as it showed the actual struggle that wrestlers live through and what goes on behind the scenes. Although it isn't memorable, it's a fun show to watch if you're bored and want to kill time as the episodes aren't really long and it has an "Orange is the New Black" vibe with its female cast. If you're a wrestling fan this is the show for you as there's a blend of comedy, wrestling and fun wrestler cameos I really loved this film- it is fun and surprisingly all about the reality, disguising in super-soap-cartoonic-wrestling. Another series that has been destroyed for 98% of people to appease the 2% with constant LGBT woke nonsense that is apparently more important than making a good story. Its so obvious its unbearable. Noone wants to see it Netflix, shove your incessant political agenda where the sun don't shine. I have never watched anything this bad before - ever! I gave up part way through episode 3 by which time I had lost the will to live. At times, it is funny and then it is just sad. The surprising thing is, with the out of control PC culture in Hollywood, that series was even made. I just finished watching the whole first season of "GLOW" on Netflix. What drew me in, initially, was a lingering interest in the actual GLOW that existed during the 1980s. I was a young child then, and I don't really remember anything about it at the time, but the GLOW documentary that came out a few years ago was enough to get me intrigued.<br/><br/>First, what this isn't: it isn't GLOW that existed in the 1980s. In many regards it's based on it, but to what extent the Netflix series actually resembles what it really was could be, and perhaps should be, debated. The characters are based on the types of characters that appeared in GLOW, and that much is clear. What motivated the actresses though to partake in the production, the real-life characters vs. the Netflix series characters, may be a bit more muddied in the latter. Some of the ladies who were involved with GLOW in the 1980s have expressed that while they see the surface similarities in the characters, little to nothing else resembled the actual production. Many of them went as far to say the boozing and drug use of "Sam Sylvia" in no way resembled the life or professionalism of director Matt Cimber, and that genuinely upset them. In other words, don't look too far beyond the surface comparisons to find any real insight into what was the real GLOW.<br/><br/>What it is though, and I think this is fair to say, is really a commentary now on what was the commentary then. GLOW was not a "wrestling promotion" in the sense of WWE, or TNA, or ROH. Those promotions are not so much commentary on society as they are about promoting sports entertainment within the confines of story and character development. GLOW was, more or less, a television show with broad reaching stereotypes, that cast actresses to play wrestlers to provide some commentary on society. It was, in a way, familiar to what fans of professional wrestling knew in terms of the moves and athleticism, but in another sense, the ladies were simply actresses playing wrestlers playing off stereotypes. Sure, there has to be some sense of acting involved in professional wrestling then (and now), but I believe that many, if not most, professional wrestlers today (men and women) are athletes first, actors and actresses second. I believe that script was flipped with GLOW.<br/><br/>Beyond the surface though, I believe Netflix's GLOW expands its commentary to the decade of the 1980s, with so much nostalgia that exists and other shows are latching onto in some sense or another. You see that with the characters making comments about the political climate, which really has nothing to do with wrestling or even pretending to wrestle. You see that with the causes that are undertaken. You even see that in the willingness to so openly embrace stereotypes and base characters off them which, in our PC world, wouldn't happen today.<br/><br/>Ultimately, what I believe Netflix's GLOW is, is a look back to an era more than a cult phenomenon of that era, but uses that cult phenomenon to promote the overall commentary. This series narrates the personal and professional challenges of a group of women trying to success in the sexist world of Hollywood and how to transform your vision into reality, and is full of underdogs for you to root for.<br/><br/>The cast is wonderful and compelling, especially Alison Brie, she is able to show her ample range, she is kind of typecast as the best friend in rom-coms, also the famous podcaster and comedian Marc Maron is a revelation as Sam Sylvia. At first I wasn't planning on watching the show at all because I am really not interested in anything wrestling related. Then I thought I would just give it a try.<br/><br/>I loved almost every minute of it. It was a little predictable sometimes, but I mostly thought that was funny. I cared about the characters. Some unexpected friendships developed, which was nice. Character development could have been more in-depth, but I am hoping they will get to that in the second season. I see some reviewers saying it didn't really feel like an 80s show, but honestly I didn't mind that at all.<br/><br/>I remember the 8th episode being over, and it switching to the 9th episode, and I was yelling 'noo!!', because I knew there were only had 2 episodes left.<br/><br/>I don't know the original GLOW, which probably changes my judgement. I am sure though that there are many people out there who haven't seen that and will enjoy this series.<br/><br/>To each his own, but I really loved it. So just give it a go and see for yourself! :D If you are looking for a mental getaway from the current political climate or relief from day to day stress, I DO NOT SUGGEST "GLOW".<br/><br/>Glow is a period piece from the 70's. I watched 6 episodes and was turned off by the stereotyped characters based on race and gender. Bad Russian, African American on welfare, Middle Eastern violent, and Caucasian real America (as usual).<br/><br/>Only watch if you are open minded and comfortable with the mockery. The women may evolve in later episodes if you have the patience to endure. I have watched only the pilot.<br/><br/>I started the episode curious, and ended it feeling 'meh.' <br/><br/>Pros: decently shot, a certain delightful if canned brio to some scenes, and Mark Maron. <br/><br/>Cons: 1) Writing: this show seems unsettled conceptually. A slapstick period comedy? A mordant comment on entertainment? High-concept fun involving women and power? All? Some? Of course it can also be "All." Still, for me this one suffers in comparison to pilots that are coherent (even if with room to grow and change), like Better Call Saul, or Nurse Jackie. <br/><br/>Narrowly, I found many of the lines tinny and straining for hilarity, and the direction unconvincing at best. The concept -- women pitted against each other for spectacle and at the same time all We Go! -- seems tired and over-determined and dull. Maybe I just don't like wrestling!<br/><br/>2) Acting: I admired Ms Brie's work with the brittle soul she played on Mad Men, though even there her portrayal could edge into a sense of striving for character rather than embodying it. Here, more often than not I simply didn't believe her, not when she was down, and not when she was fierce and determined. Wanted to root for her and all, but was not sold. The "minor" characters seems to have far more potential interest.<br/><br/>Overall, the show has dazzling shiny surfaces of every sort, but for me no real depth. <br/><br/>It may well be unfair to post a review after only the pilot. But like another reviewer, I found nothing in the show convincing or interesting enough to try again. This is a entertaining show, an easy drama with colorful characters, but this is not a comedy. I think that a chow to be considered a comedy needs funny thing happening in every episode or at least to be relaxing and feel good. Some funny moments in one episode on the second season it's not enough.
I like Alison Brie's character. She is a good actor with charm. Disappointing! This one got some good reviews, the writers had plenty of input from the real GLOW ladies of yesteryear, and I was hoping the talent on both sides of the camera could save it from the Curse of the Netflix Originals, but it was not to be. The pilot episode rocks out, but after that the series loses momentum pretty quickly. The basic shtick of the show-within-a-show could've been edgy and funny--diverse cast of lady wrestlers plays off the crassest Reagan-era stereotypes (plus-size black woman = Welfare Queen, Desi premed = AK-toting Terrorist)--but it didn't really come together during the 6 eps we watched. <br/><br/>The coup de grace, for us, was the atrocious Russian accent that Method actress Ruth (Alison Brie) puts on while she's searching for her identity as the show's designated "heel." When she decides to reboot as a kickass Israeli dressed like a character from "Yentl," we decided we'd had enough. <br/><br/>Marc Maron and Betty Gilpin ("Nurse Jackie"), not trying to stretch quite so much, do just fine, and the smaller roles are perfectly cast, but Alison B can't seem to connect with her needy underdog character, and the hit-or-miss story lines just didn't do it for us. S#1 is funny- more of an 8- sure- that actresses and untrained can do these stunt woman gymnastics. who can take a flip landing on their backs- and do a back flip off the ropes - some seem like trained dancers- gymnasts, It's funny, and entertaining, and you have to allow for some UNREAL realty. It a light hearted spoof. with lots of fun antics. 5 stars is average.<br/><br/>so sure, it has to change, can't keep focusing on the ring antics. by mid end of Season #2 something is going wrong. by Season #3- it's completely different show. so sure it had to change; but what it becomes is some soap melodrama with a different focus that doesn't really work.<br/><br/>Geena Davis 6 foot of gorgeous,10 stars in Bob Mackie dancer outfit, rather revealing- . I had friend who was a Vegas dancer, 5'11" trained ballet dancer- told me there were dancers and strippers (topless) in the 80s.<br/><br/>Spoiler- so all the performers have to leave their apartments, and stay 2 in a room at some low rent motel. who can give up an apartment, pack up, and stay in a motel. while it makes for show plots as it's one big camp, group home.
Marc falls in love with Ruth. He approaches her altho he is 2X her age,and looks it. looking on wiki- Ruth is 38, looks younger, Marc is 56- she says he is "almost twice my age"- her boyfriend isn't ready to commit to move in together. it's too soon for him. so at some point she decides to try Marc, he isn't there. Than his under 18 daughter (he didn't know about) writes a script that someone wants to produce, and gets OK for Marc to direct. what luck!!! under 18 1st time script writer in a town where ppl would sell their dog and their mother to get a script made. than they ask Ruth to read for a part- producer and daughter decide another actress is better. so Ruth has decided to give them, Marc and RUTH, a try- and Marc tells her she isnt getting the part, , and she walks off. I don't blame her.
Debbie, the semi successful actress- headliner in GLOW, is upset. she didn't see her 10 mon old 1st steps, bec she was in Las Vegas & he's in L.A. with his father. My mother was a stay at home mom. I first walked when my grandmother was baby sitting for a few hours.. my mother and father missed it. that's the way it goes. in the end she brings the toddler to Las Vegas. the father has to work, so he isn't with the child all the time. they over play this conflict-
Sean Howard, the money producer, I thought was a closet gay. a few subtle suggestions. His butler, best friend from school, leaves and dies of pneumonia, hint opportunistic aids. it is only suggested. Sean marries one of the wrestlers, she needs a green card. she hires a boy toy to make Sean jealous, bec he won't have sex with her for 2 mons. Sean encourages them to kiss, and I am thinking, no, bad idea. it is almost a 3some. but Sean and the boy toy wind up kissing and touching sex parts. seems Sean is conflicted. This was kind of obvious, but at the same time, they skirt the issues. it changes the whole direction of the show.
End of Season 3 sets up new Season 4- Just objectively speaking, this is not a good show. This is a fake feminist show. I guess it's supposed to seem 'empowering' to women, but its really just making a mockery of them. <br/><br/>The casting. They took a type A personality, who has consistently played a Type A role in all other shows and tried to make her seem like this dissolved antihero. Its just not working. Its not believable. What's more is that they have the gall to allude to someone as gorgeous as Alison Brie who lost tons of weight for this role, as 'plain looking' or 'real'. <br/><br/>The funniest 'jokes' on this show consist of people berating women. <br/><br/>Dull plot, bad casting, literally nonexistent jokes (all through the 80's lens) just amounts to big ole pile of garbage. Was really beginning to enjoy this show but yet again...the glorification of adultery. It really irks me that at this point people don't find it wrong that shows like this one make cheating on ones spouse seem so tantalizing. I thought I finally came across a bomb.com show that I could follow but that definitely does not seem like the case. Oh well, I guess Ill stick to being a prude if that means that I believe marriage is sacred and should be held so on Television. Enjoy everyone! It seems this has purely been made to appeal to perverts. But then that is what the point of female wrestling is isn't it? Shame, what could be a good series (and a good sport) is as usual spoilt and turned into a sexist objectification fest. The show was great at first then decided to remove the plot and focus on every social justice issue instead. I binge watched the first two seasons but could not finish the third due lack of story and non stop in your face politics. Shame, it was really great at first. How can you like a tv show when all the characters are stupid and you just want to hate them for every decision they make, or maybe you guys just like drama, because all this sht is a big , not so good story, drama. The first few episodes were really good, but then.. the same story, same mistakes, same problems.. uh. I agree, season 3 added waaay more sex and nudity than necessary (and I'm only on the 3 episode). Second season was so much better than the first, last couple episodes were so interesting i practically flew through it. Glad it's renewed for a third season. This Netflix sitcom is something that's become the norm with the streaming company: It's got a unique premise, a talented and likable cast, and terrific writing and directing, but takes maybe just a little too long to get to the point. Functioning like a 10-episode miniseries instead of a television show, "GLOW" (which stands for "Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling") is filled with stand-out moments and elements, from the premise itself to the ensemble acting (Alison Brie, Betty Gilpin and Marc Maron make a great trio of leads, while supporting players like Britney Young, Kia Stevens and Jackie Tohn register despite a whole slew of peripheral characters), to its absolutely fantastic finale. While it tends to drag a bit in the middle, it rewards its audience's patience, and surprisingly manages to make wrestling itself compelling to an audience perhaps unfamiliar with the format. Great story line. However, some of the dialogue and scenarios were ridiculous, and a few members of the cast were over-the-top in their acting, some to the point of being annoying. I decided to give the show a chance, due to my enjoying GLOW in the 80's, and almost gave it up after 2 episodes, but it was Marc Maron's performance that kept me coming back. I would give Glow a perfect 10 but they play a lot of 80s music. I had low expectations but really enjoyed this show. Maron was the biggest surprise. Warm funny obscene but winning. I added this show to my Netflix queue on impulse. By the second episode, I was hooked. This show is funny, even witty at times, and the writing is spot-on. The acting is fantastic, and even when the characters are a bit over the top, it somehow fits. There are no throw-away characters here, and by the end of the season you will be sad to see them go.<br/><br/>Alison Brie and Betty Gilpin are fabulous, but the real stand-out for me was Marc Maron. I absolutely love his broken, flawed, and somehow charming character.<br/><br/>When you're feeling the need for a little 80s nostalgia and some soulful comedy, give this one a go. I think that you'll enjoy it. Warning: there is some adult content present (nudity, drugs, sex)<br/><br/>I was really surprised that I enjoyed this show as much as I have so far. Alison Brie is an excellent actress and I really thought she nailed this role. The whole premise of taking misfit women and teaching them how to wrestle is funny in itself but there are little moments or scenes here and there that take the show from being mediocre to something worth watching. This is not just a show for wrestling fans. The plot while predictable is still entertaining enough. The acting has been really good so far with only a few characters lacking slightly but definitely worth a watch.
