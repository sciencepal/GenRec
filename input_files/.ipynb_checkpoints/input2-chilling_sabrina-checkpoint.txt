I really enjoyed season 1 and season 2 was watchable and fun at times... but season 3 is like a bad high school play written by the students. I feel bad for the adult actors in this show. Season 3 is Scooby Doo meets Highs School Musical. The musical numbers that are jammed into the episodes make no sense I actually really enjoyed seasons 1 and 2. I thought the story was interesting. This season is all over the place and it's not helped by the fact that the main character keeps making dumb decisions. I could understand her being oblivious in the first year, since it's all new territory, but this whole "I'm so love struck that I can't possibly be rational" is just tired. Couple that with both Pagans AND the Dark Lord creating havoc, all while Sabrina has to prove she has what it takes to rule hell??? It's just too much. Why Sabrina is a musical now? I am very disappointed. This series had a strong start but the more I watched it the worse it became. The dialogue and storyline just got more hoakey and tacky, to the point where it was cringe worthy. At some points it got so bad I yelled out give me a break!<br/><br/>I would not recommend this show, it's like a dark-updated version of the original but with rip-offs from Harry Potter and twilight. Basically it's a train wreck. And there a lot of holes in the plot. I'm not going to reveal them but they just don't make sense or add up.<br/><br/>Great show for a teenager going thru a phase, horrible for a 29 year old looking for quality entertainment (me). I really want to see the second part of this show and I hope it will not dissapoint me as this first part. I see potential and beauty of main heroine, but also see all this blurry effects, plot holes, propaganda, etc. Maybe I'm just too old and 15-years old girls would love it, but they also deserves better shows... Was so excited for the part 3 release but was disappointed quickly. So much going on everywhere in part 3 it was hard to keep my attention. Hopeful for a part 4 comeback as this series still has potential somewhere. So much potential in this show but it doesn't have a sense of direction and it's onviously wrote to cater to the "progressive" tumblr teenagers. Garbage. For a show that was hyped by Netflix heavily in the run up to its release, the final product lacked considerably in appeal.<br/><br/>The season was finished largely by the viewer on Autopilot almost a "I've started this so I'll finish it" objective rather than enjoyment.<br/><br/>The episodes themselves felt drawn out and lack lustre and often times disjointed. If you're in to the supernatural, you could most likely do better than this. Perhaps season two might deliver better but between over acting on some parts and under acting on others, it would take magic to breath life into this dead witches tale. I was really looking forward to this and I was disappointed. I wanted to like this. The problem is the protagonist Sabrina. She's good. She's likeable. She's on the right side of every issue. I mean I get it: she's an SJW, and from a purely political perspective I'm with her into smashing the patriarchy, whether that's in High School or the Coven.<br/><br/>However, the problem with a perfectly perfect protagonist is that she quickly becomes boring and uninteresting. Her relationships are boring, her pontificating gets boring, the other players become cliches. I got through the series....barely. I'm exactly who this show is aimed at. I'm a 20-something who grew up watching the original, and now quite happy to enjoy a bit of nostalgia!<br/><br/>As everyone has noted, the similarities to the original exist with proper nouns and little more. This is a much darker take on it, and that's fine by me.<br/><br/>What I did find disconcerting is just how overtly Satanic it is ('Satanism' here refers to an odd mix of Wicca, various pagan belief systems and theistic Satanism). I don't have any strongly held religious views of my own, but I found this rather tasteless and the writers seemed to deliberately want to cause offence.<br/><br/>This clashed terribly with the characterisation, which is cutesy and oddball. Zelda and Hilda ooze with personality with great performances by Miranda Otto and Lucy Davis. Richard Coyle is sufficiently sinister as Father Blackwood, the Satanic high priest, and Michelle Gomez is excellent in everything she's in.<br/><br/>The younger performers do my head in. Ross Lynch plays Sabrina's boyfriend Harvey, and it's not really Lynch's fault, but boy is Harvey is a complete waste of space - you have to wonder what Sabrina sees in him beyond his looks and endless stream of cheesy dialogue which could only be the result of a screenwriter's first draft. Kiernan Shipka is a great actress, and she's perfect for the role of Sabrina, but she's so righteous it's annoying.<br/><br/>The show's political agenda is cloying and watching it has made me realise why conservatives hate us lefty-liberal millennial snowflake types (use whatever terms you like). Their attitude is so holier-than-thou in the face of Hollywood clich√©s (because we've never seen bullying jocks on screen before) and they're quite keen to advertise how enlightened they are, which only causes division, entrench views and inhibit constructive dialogue. It's unhelpful.<br/><br/>I long for the day when we can watch a film or TV show and see diversity on screen without having it telegraphed at us. Producers and screenwriters seem to struggle with 'naturalistic' diversity and instead like to draw attention to it rather than simply have actors and characters that fit the narrative. The best show I've seen on this recently is Thirteen Reasons Why, and while I have mixed views about the show itself, the characterisation was excellent and the diversity never felt shoe-horned, but natural.<br/><br/>In Sabrina, this detracts from the narrative as we flip between the interesting horror elements and the rather dull real-world storylines. Plot threads come and go, and the pacing is all over the place. At one point, Sabrina gets tasked with solving a puzzle that people have spent years attempting to crack. We know she's going to solve it eventually, but rather than see her work and study at it - unravelling a mystery and having an adventure on the way - she just solves it. Blink and you'll miss it. You're left thinking: oh.<br/><br/>The show is well-made enough. There are some odd editing choices and filming style that will irk some people, but it didn't really bother me. It looks really good.<br/><br/>Otherwise, I really just wish they'd made a solid fantasy/horror show for adults - something in a similar vein to Buffy or even Stranger Things. It didn't need all the extra clutter.<br/><br/>P.S. Oh yeah, and Salem...beloved Salem. He's there, only now he's just a cat who doesn't do a whole lot. His character has been replaced by a guy called Ambrose whose narrative role is to dish out the occasional bit of sage advice and be gay. The blurry shots trying to be edgy completely ruins the series.
I felt like I'd drank 10 pints 90% of the time trying to watch it.
Inconsistent accents are a big no from me, yanks trying on an English accent is nearly as bad as a brummy pretending to talk posh.
With purely terrible acting, mixed with an awful script üëéüèª
Overall...don't waste your time The writing was cheesy and lazy, I watched the whole thing and I regret it.
They super overdid it with the Satanism stuff.
Sabrina's character is so problematic and I kept thinking "why is she doing that?". She's supposed to be incredibly bright and gifted but she does things every episode that are obviously stupid decisions.
I didn't understand what their audience was supposed to be. I thought the dialogue was rather dumbed-down and childish which was strange.
There were lots of little things that bugged me, like how they are CONSTANTLY talking about Sabrina and her dead parents but never address where Ambrose came from. And Harvey. I'm sure Ross Lynch is a great actor but Harvey is just so boring.
Everyone is trying to kill each other for no reason and the sex scenes feel randomly thrown in. I could go on but I think I'll end my review here. I didn't enjoy it I'd say they got half of it right. Love the actress and everyone but there is something missing that stops me from watching, maybe the story or something. What I find annoying is the 'praise satan' every 5 minutes. Meh... For someone who enjoys supernatural and magical shows, this series is extremely flawed. The plot for example felt weak. Going to a magical school and studying magic sounds awesome and exciting until you see that the only thing they seem to be doing there are choir practice and bullying. Not a lot actually happens in this show even though the episodes are hour long. A lot of teen drama, with little significance.
The characters for the most part felt weak as well. Aunt Zelda was the only high point of this series. We see her growing and eventually the Zelda we saw at the beginning of the series is completely different to the Zelda we see at the end of the series. Her love for her family grows stronger than her love for the dark lord.
The show did include some bizarre choices, like the blurring effect which I guess was supposed to create some sort of atmosphere, but failed miserably. The main protagonist is annoying and naive . She's really not good at all . I found myself rolling my eyes & sighing every time she comes up with a plan to help herself and Harvey. At the end of the day, no respect towards her aunts or Ambrose. Just real B.S. since when does a 16yr old tell her Aunts what to do?. IMDb crashed and deleted my long review, so :'''))) I'm going to keep this short:
I understand why fans of "Sabrina the Teenage Witch" are rating this series so highly, because they think it's a fresh and exciting take, however, this is a poor adaptation of the actual comic this is based on, a horror comic titled "Chilling Adventures of Sabrina. Moving past the fresh and exciting ideas of the comic, it's not a compelling representation of them.<br/><br/><ul><li>This series waters down SO much. In the original comic, there was a heavy emphasis on Sabrina's aunts being cannibals, graphic scenes of Hell and Satanic rituals, nudity and gore were EVERYWHERE. It immediately set a legitimate horror tone for the comic, whereas you never get the feeling in this tv show like something bad might happen to the characters. It feels too "nice" and like an obvious tv production, like Riverdale. There's not the same standard of narrative tension.</li></ul><br/><br/>-They also jumble up the story wildly (and remove some of the best aspects) from the comic - I assume to stretch it out so they can add them in later. And while you can argue that this is an adaptation and it doesn't need to be the same, the point is that it's not better - in fact, it's less interesting. For an example - this isn't even a spoiler because its not in the show - in the comic, Harvey follows Sabrina to her dark baptism and get murdered/eaten by witches (and then brought back to life through necromancy). But the point of him being there was incredibly important to **certain** decisions for Sabrina, and it's exciting (hello!! murdering the love interest and then necromancy? awesome). But they just cut it out. And the resulting scene is just, less important for her as a character, and its duller<br/><br/>-There are storylines inserted (mainly high school drama ones) that add nothing to the show other than confusing its tone.<br/><br/>-Netflix shows should have the luxury of "showing" not "telling" and allowing for a more cinematic experience. I couldn't count the number of times that people's backstories and personalities were just explained through dialogue instead of showing us.<br/><br/><ul><li>There's a couple of problems with continuity, jarring edits and an overuse of short focal length and blur in the cinematography. To me, this plays like something which should have been picked up on in the edit, and been fixed during reshoots (which is a professional standard) but it wasn't.</li></ul><br/><br/>Overall, there are positives about this series (set design is good, it is also atmospheric in places, and I don't mind the actors), but when you really look at this series, it plays like Riverdale, which is ""okay"" if they're pandering to a younger audience, but this series could have been something GREAT in the vein of more serious adaptations like the Haunting of Hill House. I highly recommend that if you're unsure about what I'm talking about, read the comic series "Chilling Adventures of Sabrina", because it's definitely more arresting than this. I was hoping this would have a Santa Clarita Diet vibe; fun but a little gory and easy to watch without needing too much brain activity.
However, within the first three episodes I tired of the politics. The sub plots of Sabrina's friends are boring and predictable. They seem to have wanted to include every minority possible, which seems forced and like a move at wanting to please everyone.
And the blurry shots drive me mad! At first I wondered if they were meant to indicate an illusion or a dream, but they're EVERYWHERE. It gets really annoying to look at. I don't like shows that push political ideologies down my throat and vilify people who disagree. I watch tv shows to try to get away from politics and this show seems to only promote extreme feminism, stereotypical sexist football players, daughters of the black panthers, and victim mentality. Kill the preachiness and the show might be ok. Kind of weird having so much satanism in a show too. There's much to says here that others have beaten me to, but one thing has not. This show takes a unique and compelling approach to a world of witchcraft and occultism -- a world that is fascinating, mysterious, and begs more exploration -- then plagues it by a self-centered protagonist who defies, disrupts, and resists it at every turn.<br/><br/>The writing is dreadfully predictable and the teenage angle is weakened by a dirge of cardboard characters, including a bland boyfriend with a backstory so thin it makes you wonder why its on-screen. These individuals are sometimes shoehorned as a means to propel the plot, but fail as anything more than filler because they're only exist in half of Sabrina's world -- the human half. The boring half. And they're gated from the witching world, which is all we actually care to see.<br/><br/>In lieu of a lack of witching friends in her age and circumstance, the entire plot centers around a no-less Harry Potter knock-off who can do and accomplish all better than anyone else on the show. Sabrina needs only a quantum of help at any given time so that she can turn and save the day yet again, sometimes twice an episode. She's perfect at everything and never fails and is never bested. She can sing perfectly for no reason and it never comes up again. She can overcome pranks AND pranksters. She can master puzzles. And she has the nerve to stand up to teachers in class. And she heads a rebellious school club. Oh and two boys lust after her, because this needed a love triangle. (Gag.)<br/><br/>Sabrina is written with no weaknesses or bad qualities, and most obnoxious of all, her teenage mindset is constantly catered to. She is the center of the world in this show and she knows it. All of her problems are the most critical and important and must be addressed immediately. No one has a life outside of hers and if they do, it has no impact on the larger story, so we don't care.<br/><br/>7 episodes in, I stopped caring about the show entirely. I was really hoping this show would be awesome...but it's sooooo bad. I watched it all in hopes that it would get better, but it didn't. Nothing happened!! Like each episode something would happen and then the music would escalate and I thought, yes here we go. And then it fizzled. Like Harvey's brother scenario was awful. They built it up so bad like he would turn into this cool zombie and start eating people but no. He fell asleep and Harvey shot him in his sleep. Or there's.all these witches and they don't DO anything. Barely use their powers. The very last episode was the best one!! The thirteen?? Like the whole season should have built up to that. But even with these thirteen witches, they didn't do anything either!! They showed up and walked around being creepy and that's it. And same with the horseman. Again, built up this whole damn episode and then it was over. Nothing happened. Such a big disappointment. BORING The show is overtly political and cringe inducing. The show-makers are unable to create a consistent feel to the show. It seems that they were more focussed on unnecessary aspects like rhyming spells, awful blurry effect and making political statements rather than actually making a good show whose premise held a lot of potential.
Why does it have to be political? I don't get it.
The only explanation I can think of is that they know their target audience and are playing a strategic move, which seems to be working since it has somehow managed a rating of 8. Like many reviews that have been posted, I was disappointed with this series. I knew the tv show and liked it but Netflix presented this as a more adult darker version. The adult actors and storyline were the only thing that kept me interested in viewing until the end. The social justice and extreme feminist messages are very off putting and caused me to lose interest a few episodes in.
I thought that Netflix would have avoided the "teenage" feel and made a more true to life feeling show(like Sabrina signing the book the first time as an acceptance of adulthood and understanding life isn't always about getting what u want) I understand Sabrina is a teenager and she's essentially "growing up" thru the first season. However, the messages of female superiority and warriors of social justice is being forced down the viewer's throats.
I will be the first to admit that I'm just too mature for the subject matter, it doesn't land well. They portrayed Sabrina in such a way that at some point I felt like killing her instead of the antagonist.
Plots aren't that good though they had huge potential. And moreover since the villain isn't that good/strong ...which makes the entire series weaker.
And to some part it felt like they were literally showing some dark rituals... :/ I have been searching for years for something to fill the void Buffy left after it went off air. No other show has been able to capture that perfect mixture of storytelling, action, acting, horror themes, Satan, witches, magic and monsters quite like Buffy did the only thing that has come remotely close is AHS Coven+Apocalypse.<br/><br/>Sadly CAofS does not live up to those expectations. This incarnation of Sabrina has entirely too many fundamental flaws at this point to recommend. With some serious changes the show could be great but if things remain as they are it won't last five seasons.<br/><br/>Some bizarre casting choices, the two aunts don't sound like they're from the same continent let alone same family tree. Red head aunt is great, blonde aunt needs to be recast she doesn't fit in at all, if she were cast as the house keeper it would've been fully believable but there is no way in hell this Zelda and Hilda are related which throws that entire narrative out the window.<br/><br/>Adding in Ambrose as an original character rather than have him be the human form of Salem is a questionable choice at best not to mention much of his screen time is reduced to being the token "gay" rather than having any significant storyline. It would've been much more effective to have him be cursed to live as a cat in the house while being able to project a human form.<br/><br/>The casting of Sabrina is terrible. They found some girl that looks the closest they could find to Emma Watson without taking into account if she could act. She has the absolute worst most wooden delivery I have ever seen. She's totally unbelievable as an actress, she does not act she just delivers lines. In this the entire universe revolves around Sabrina and every other character feels just there to pad screen time further. Everything is about Sabrina, everything involves Sabrina, Sabrina is the most perfect amazing solution for everything and EVERYTHING needs to be set-up around her every one else is just background noise for Sabrina to be the focus of.<br/><br/>
Harvey's character has been reduced from the dumb but cute and loving boyfriend to a Johnny-sue desperately in love, doting and fawning hollow shell of an empty love interest.<br/><br/>Then of course every new show has to have that one "gender neutral" character, speaking as a trans woman we skipped right past casting transgender characters and went right to "non-binary" which I personally find insulting.<br/><br/>Sexy teacher is amazing, the High Priest does a decent job but there is only so much they can do with the amateur writing. It says a lot about a show when the villains are way more compelling then the main heroine. After finishing the first season I just kind of want Satan to win because of how insufferable Sabrina is.<br/><br/>"Oh I love you more than anything in the world you're my everything" - Proceeds to eat each others faces for a solid minute of screen time.<br/><br/>The worst offender so far is the writing, whoever writes the dialog should be fired immediately and never be allowed to write character dialog again. Absolutely NO ONE speaks the way the majority of the characters talk to each other. I have laughed out loud several times during the first few episodes, not because what was said was meant to be funny but because of how absolutely absurd the dialog is. There are very few conversations that happen between characters however there is a metric **** ton of thesaurus word vomit happening in every scene.<br/><br/>They don't really seem to converse with each other just throw r/iamverysmart word salad at each other.<br/><br/>Having every character spout extensive dialog with an abundance of grandiose language (see how obnoxious that comes across?) really cheapens the entire thing. Sabrina sounds like every not popular nerd teen's intellectual wet dream it's very off putting as she just does not seem believable in the role nor is this archetype enjoyable to endure.<br/><br/>The heroine getting literally everything handed to her deus ex machina style, having the entire universe center around her but not in the Buffy way where everyone gets a fair storyline even if it's about Buffy is hamfisted. She's walking perfection and it's plain boring to watch. Sabrina is supposed to be likable to make people root for her, this one I just want her off the screen because literally all the other characters are more enjoyable, not to mention the scenes with her and Harvey are stomach turningly cringe.<br/><br/>This series should be everything I want in a show but it's been so disappointing over all. It's as though they have stolen amazing storylines from Buffy+AHS Coven+Harry Potter+The Craft+Hanna Montana with the backdrop of Sabrina to make this but it ends up being a cheap knock off of much better material.<br/><br/>I swear if the finales message is love and friendship always wins I'll barf.<br/><br/>The "real world" parts and the "Witch world" parts just don't mesh well together in this. The contrast is so stark it's like going from an after school special to a poor PG-13 horror movie from scene to scene.<br/><br/>Several issues could be dealt with by recasting Sabrina+Hilda and hiring new writers + restructuring dialog but If the cringe word salad remains I can't see it lasting very long as it leaves a lot to be desired.<br/><br/>If you're an edgy teenage girl I'm sure you'll love it but if you're from the Buffy generation+ I doubt you'll find much fulfillment here as it's an amalgamation of much better TV shows storylines.<br/><br/>Stick to AHS unless the writing can be GREATLY improved upon and Sabrina is made even slightly likable. I am trying to understand the reviews above a 3, but it doesn't seem as though we watched the same show. This is absolutely unwatchable, in my opinion, and I'm fairly open to new concepts.<br/><br/>No, I didn't go into this expecting the old Sabrina- I expected knew it was designed to be "chilling". No the political jargon didn't bother me as much as the other 1-star reviewers (although it's strange and misplaced). This is a 1 because it's simply bad television- no plot, no empathy for the characters, extremely strange looking "demons" that are essentially bad Halloween makeup, nothing scary or comedic or dramatic about it - I have zero feelings at all after watching this. Couldn't get through episode 4 without rolling my eyes and shutting it off. While I love the darker tone of this series it's really spoiled by over abundance of SJW moments. From the tearing down of the white patriarchy to the acceptance of rape/assault culture afforded to white males of privilege, onto the idea that women are superior to men in every way to the burdens of the LBGTQ community. These themes permeate a truly excellent reimagining of the tv show. Eye roll after eye roll occurred at these preachy moments. While these issues should be addresed in our culture, it appeared that the writers of this series were trying to include as many as they could into the first season. I applaud societal progress but spoonfuls are more enjoyable than trying to swallow a dump truck full. Now I'm for thrillers and horror films and tv shows however Netflix's Chilling Adventures of Sabrina is not a show I would recommend.<br/><br/>I found it pressing too much into the cult rather than actual witch or Wicca magic (good magic). I'm not a religious person but I found it distasteful. Now as for the plot it was serious unorganized and as I said pressed into the satanic cult a little to much for my taste.<br/><br/>It seems to be all about the entertainment of the gore of satanic worship than a simply dark themed TV show like American Horror Story for example. Which I don't like but still think is far better plot and theme when it comes to the dark and twisted.<br/><br/>I just think there need to be for to a show than some loss plot, dark theme and some light comedy.<br/><br/>P.S. I know it's not even meant to be close to the 1996 show but I loved watching Sabrina The Teenage Witch as a kid and then again as an adult. That version of a wise cracking Salem was be far one of the greatest characters ever made! As the title says - too much focuseffects!<br/><br/>right now, i cant tell you much about the story - switched off the tv after 20 minutes
of episode one. all i could "see" is that it got potential!
i hope there will be a version without this blurring, so people can try to enjoy this show! From beginning to end, the tone is so violently inconsistent I never know how to feel. The rules of the universe are also inconsistent, which makes for a plot puzzle unable to be untangled.<br/><br/>The visuals are refreshingly unique. The themes are... there if deeply searched for? The acting can't make up for the cheesy dialogue. It's campy, which is good for some viewers and annoying for others.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a confusing ride with more painful squinting than focused enjoyment. Why every show nowadays needs to force political propagan on regular viewers
Story is mess, Shipka is bad actress, blur movie effects are awful and Social Justice Political Propaganda completely made Sabrina reboot one of the worst tv show this year
This is awful mess. I wouldn't recommend this even to my worst enemy Keirnan shipka is terrible. A poor choice of actress that severely let down her rather talented co stars. You find yourself wanting her to die throughout and the dark lord to win. If only it were a story about her aunts. I was thoroughly enjoying the old "Sabrina the Teenage Witch" TV series back in the day. I didn't know that Netflix were bringing the series back to life though, and happened to come across it by sheer random luck. Seeing that it was a delve into the series that I once enjoyed, of course I had to sit down and watch "Chilling Adventures of Sabrina".<br/><br/>Right, well I will say that this 2018 re-visit sure was a notch up in most areas. I liked how they opted for a more mature approach to the series and the characters, and also the dark, gloomy and gothic look that the series had to it.<br/><br/>The characters, well, some were great, others were bland. But the acting was good and people did do good jobs with their given roles.<br/><br/>One thing that doesn't sit well with me in this new 2018 series is the familiar Salem. Sure, he was atrocious to look at back in the old "Sabrina the Teenage Witch" series, but he was talking and he had so much humor with him. In the new series, he is an ordinary cat milling about, unable to speak (or at least haven't done so yet) and is obviously not a funny sidekick at all.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed the dark and Satanic twist they put into it this time, definitely turning it up from a corny teenage series to a more adult series.<br/><br/>I managed to sit through season one in just one day, but am somewhat uncertain of whether or not to carry on watching it once season two is available. It was good, sure, but just lacked the charming appeal that the old series had. Made by idiots, actually. Little character development, minimal backstory. Awful, awful characterization of the Satanic and its rituals. This is how Satanism is understood by 5-year-olds.<br/><br/>Witches who fawn over "the Dark Lord" as if he were the local hunk. Forgetting all the evil things done in his name. Students who never study anything but get caught up in insane plots that solve nothing. Adults who behave little better than bullies. People's lives sacrificed willy-nilly on a whim.<br/><br/>The "theology" is the absolute worst. Nobody ever thought to consult a decent theological textbook or theologian. For instance, Eve didn't die, therefore "the false" God lied when he said they would if they ate of the tree of knowledge. But she did die - eventually. The Bible just never said when she would.<br/><br/>This and other lies about Christianity are worth cancelling this show over. But it gets a 2nd season. It should never have finished the first. Ignore the good ratings. The acting in this show is some of the worst ive ever seen. Do not waste your time Should've been titled Sabrina the Feminist, because that's what it basically is.<br/><br/>It's not like Sabrina the Teenage Witch, which was great show. But this isn't bad either, it's just meh. Like imagine a Sabrina the Teenage Witch AU that takes place in Supernatural. That's what this is.
I'm not saying it's horrible, but I'm not saying it's great either. Expected entertainment, got propaganda. Why nowadays almost impossible to find not politicised show? This could have been a decent show, but it was ruined by beating the watcher over the head with a political agenda. There is a time and place for politics. It doesn't seem like a very intelligent move to alienate members of the potential audience for this show by pushing ideas of identity politics. It's really too bad as I had looked forward to this one, but it's time to move on. Everything about this show speaks to recycled modern tropes. The female protagonist is practically perfect in every way, no real flaws or vices to speak of, with the mysterious maturity of a 30-year old woman instead of a 16-year old one. 3 stars because of the good acting of the adults in this series, her aunts in particular do a great job, as does Richard Coyle (as usual) as the high priest of satan. Other than that, the series is bland, the story progression obvious. Sabrina the Teenage Trope gets a stereotypical egocentric narrative, what all teenagers today dream about apparently I watched the original Sabrina and it was a funny, lighthearted show. I thought I would give this one a try. I knew it was suppose to be more serious and darker in tone. I was thinking something along the lines of Supernatural or Charmed, but this show is dangerous. The reason I say that is that this show is geared toward our youth and it is about satanism. It talks so much about satan and has so many satanic images in it. I watched three episodes (mainly hoping it would get better), and it made me sick to my stomach to think that anyone today would find this show appealing. Watched it for 5 min then had to turn off. Tried again a couple hours later and made it another 15-20 min. Nope. Once again I had to turn it off. Man this was a good piece of garbage let me tell you. It's my fault, really, for having high hopes for this show. I went in expecting a witty, dark coming-of-age story that'd keep me on the edge of my seat. It is, however, none of those things.<br/><br/>The characters: The only character worth paying attention to is Ambrose. He gets a decent backstory, his motivations, dreams and hopes got me rooting for him. The rest of the characters are bland, one dimensional, they just exist. The black girl is black. The mean bully is mean. The boyfriend is in love. Sabrina is "special". That's it. Nobody else gets a proper backstory and there's never much of a reason for what they do. Except the demons. Who are very talkative and will tell you exactly what they are doing and why they are doing it. Which accidentally ruins the, in my opinion, best scene in the entire shows as you are made perfectly aware of how it's fake and it's only a matter of time before Sabrina saves the day.<br/><br/>The horror is disappointing. Since everything is spelled out, there's no suspense or thrill. I assumed they'd go for gore since that's Sabrina's favourite but, no. I mean, yes, they tried but compared to other gore-oriented horror shows, it just falls flat on its face. I never knew I could care this little about cannibalism.<br/><br/>The story: I'm still looking for it. Does it start in season 2?<br/><br/>As a side note: Whoever suggested they call the primary antagonist "the Dark Lord", should've been fired on the spot.<br/><br/>I wouldn't say it's overly political. I did recently watch Charmed 2018 so my bar might be exceptionally high. They do throw around social concepts but never follow through on them and forget them fast enough for it to have no impact on anything. The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina tries entirely too hard to be a dark twisted version of a teen classic. It completely misses the mark. Political? please, if you want to open a discussion about misogyny, feminisms etc.. you really don't need caricatures to prove your point. It just feel like a "good PR" ploy, completely devoid of substance. I have literally never disliked a show this much since Riverdale. Boring, bad acting. As i watched, it became more and more boring. and slowly, I found Sabrina to be something like a spoiled brat who thinks just because she's a witch, she can do anything she wants. she doesn't think of consequences it has to her and people around her. i find it utterly baffling how stupid and short sighted she is! she thinks she's so special just because she's a half-witch which isn't something to be thought positively on considering it was highly frowned upon to have relations with morals. her father was an exception because he was a High Priest but she thinks she has the same right just cause her father did too? so stupid. who is she anyway? what are her achievements and contributions to the Church of Night anyway?<br/><br/>hated her specially when she tried to bring Harvey's brother Tommy back to life. I mean i understand that it's the witches' fault but when she found out things were going south, she should have put Tommy to rest. i can't believe she insulted her family and turned to the most untrustworthy person ever, Ms.Wardwell. and the consequence of her actions led to her family being shamed, breaking up with Harvey and Tommy not even alive. plus the Church of Night despising her family especially her. she single-handedly dishonored and shamed the Spellman name. I came to this thinking it might be something like penny dreadful, but boy was i wrong.
The acting is above average, the cinematography is good, but i dont like the lens flares,and i like the dark side of this world.
Also like everyone has mentioned in the review, its filled with propaganda. which is the main reason that killed it for me.
i want to watch a show and be entertained, to forget the reality i live in, but this show shoves feminism, white supremacy, etc. into your face, political agendas are subplots in this show...
In short, i wanted more witches/devils/monsters but i got a soap opera with political undertone. Was all ready to spend the night binge watching this show. So dissappointed not 20 minutes into the show it's, transgender bullying, inequality for women among numerous other political points. I think these issues are important and worth talking about...but can we get a break from it all and enjoy a little spooky magic!?! You know, I was really hoping for this to be good, but it was just weird. Like I loved the main actress in Mad Men and was hoping this might be good. However, the whole show was just kinda odd the way they did it. Like they made the plot just not relateable at all. Like I think any normal person would be like "ya no I'll pass on joining a satanic cult", but Sabrina was all for it until she realized she'd lose some rights or something. It wasn't like she didn't wanna do it because you know it's a satanic cult, it was because she is a strong women who isn't going to be told what to do by anyone. Like what are you serious.
Another very odd thing was the way they tried to involve social justice. Like don't get me wrong I'm all for social reform and social justice, I love that stuff, but the way they did it in this show was just so wrong and cringe worthy. Like they tired to add every social justice issue into like 3 people. And whenever the plot focused on those people I was just bored because none of those people, except one, really struggled with those issues and they were so clearly fake it was just wrong.
Don't waste your time watching this show, it not that good. It's not terrible, but it's just not anything worth your time This series is so, so bad.
First off, none of the actors have chemistry with each other. And half of them can't act, the other half look pained having to say their dialogue.
But, let's get into the actual show.
It's boring, half the dialogue is exposition, they constantly tell us story points instead of showing. And the writing is so painfully stiff.
There is meant to be suspense when there is none, you can't care about any of the characters, it doesn't help that all the plot points are so painfully predictable.
The side stories (anything involving her school) are so tedious that it honestly feels like they'll never end.
As for the main plot? Yeeeeeah, 90% of it is a straight Twilight rip-off, just replace witch with vampire and girl with boy. And yeah, the preachy parts are very, very ham fisted.
The editing is off pace, scenes jump from one to the other, there's no flow, and conversations are always shot in a camera A camera B set up. And the blurry camera effect gets super annoying.<br/><br/>It's a bad show. Don't bother. I thought i would watch a nice supernatural series but rather than that i am watching the manifesto against white men. I am not a man and I am Southern European so no blue eyes and golden hair here but I feel offended as well.<br/><br/>If they wanted to make a point against bullying in general where all people can be included and in general bad behavior is contempt then i would agree but thats not what they do. They show women as eternal victims and men, white men specifically, to be evil just for the sake of it. They are accused just for being men and white. Its ridiculous, is non stop and is over the top.
I am really proud of being a woman and i dont need people to talk on my behalf, I am not a victim and any bad behavior is unacceptable no matter is its a woman who does it against a man or the opposite. Admission, I am a huge fan of the Melissa Joan Hart comedy version. I was as a child, and I still am as a parent. It's all-age appropriate, charming, funny, inventive, touching and has flashes of genuine brilliance in the first four seasons.<br/><br/>And I get that this version is very different by design. Gloomy, serious, and featuring graphic bloody murder. No chuckles here. Fine, I welcome change. I #WelcomeDiversity. In one thing, and one thing only, I expected consistency: in the essential character and nature of Sabrina Spellman. I was fascinated to see how that character would deal with darkness.<br/><br/>What did we get? Well, we get a know-it-all Sabrina. Thus far, thus reasonable, she is an intelligent character. We get a Sabrina who is loved by and expresses love for an insipid, pointless, forgettable Harvey. This is both precocious and curious, as it gives her character no room for romantic growth. And then we get a brief flash of a joyous Sabrina, which is spot on. But after that bait, we get the switch. We get Sabrina 2.0.<br/><br/>This is introduced via a supporting cast which is of its time. Heavy, bespectacled friend of color. Genderfluid friend. And Sabrina is their champion. This is well, and as it should be.<br/><br/>The treatment is heavy handed, however. This Sabrina, at fifteen years old, already knows everything and needs to learn nothing. All teenagers believe this, but it is the responsibility of adult writers to show that they still have some growing to do. Not here. This is Gen Z written by Gen X, with absolute moral certainty.<br/><br/>This Sabrina #BelievesSurvivors. She believes them, absolutely and without question, even when she doesn't witness the events that they claim happened. If Sabrina doesn't see them, we, the audience don't see them, but we are expected to believe that they happened, because Sabrina believes. Ponder for a second the significance of that, and the message that is being delivered about social versus actual justice.<br/><br/>This Sabrina demands the justice of the mob, a witch-hunt. Oh, she doesn't like that name, she says, but she is fine with demanding the same actions and results. Sabrina 2.0 demands male guilt by default. She calls out the Patriarchy. This Sabrina is, by any reasonable description, a social justice warrior of the feels-before-reals, innocent-until-proven-accused sort.<br/><br/>And the moral tub thumping and virtue signalling just never stops. Racism, box ticked - and at last, we find a way to show racism against pretty thin white girls. It was touched on in the comics and the comedy, it was resurrected in Harry Potter, but here it is front and centre.<br/><br/>#GoblinLivesMatter. #AffirmativeFamiliarConsent. Yes, it does feel like a series of hashtags being waved like weapons.<br/><br/>But all this, I could forgive. Even then I was prepared to carry on, but for one scene with utterly and irrevocably changes and soils the character of Sabrina Spellman. I present it without apology, because it is vital to knowing if you want to watch this version.<br/><br/>It is solid, repeatedly established canon that Sabrina Spellman loves animals, is kind to animals, that she is empathetic and that she would never harm an animal.<br/><br/>But this Sabrina Spellman kills an injured animal.<br/><br/>Worse, she kills it simply because its anguish is bothering her. She kills it without thought or hesitation. She kills it without making any attempt to help it. She kills it without remorse, and without examining or questioning her actions afterwards.<br/><br/>And she kills it with the very thing that in a world of magic might have provided a way to save it.<br/><br/>This Sabrina Spellman's compassion is strictly selective, and dependent on #Issues and convenience.<br/><br/>This Sabrina Spellman is a cold, cruel, fickle monster, and I have no interest in her or her troubles. I am binging this show right after "Haunting of Hill House" so I am slightly disappointed. It's okay, don't get me wrong, but I can see myself getting bored after 1 or 2 seasons.
Also, I hate the blurry camera shots. Sabrinas character for whatever reason annoyed the hell out of me. As the show progresses she becomes more and more unbelievable and less and less likeable. At the end I was rooting for her character to "burn In hell" lol. Missed the mark for me. Very cool idea with the "darkness" concept. Also the time period makes no sense, it's like set in the 50s or 60s almost. Everyone has those clothes and cars but then the main kid Harvey is the only person to use a IPHONE?! wtf Didn't even finish 1st episode. The blur effect makes it unwatchable. Can we not make a decent show without cramming political nonsense into it to try and appeal to SJW culture. I am by no means on either side but this type of nonsense ruins shows. Some movies/tv shows make up for a lack of comedy and acting by forcing SJW agenda down everyones throats *Ghostbusters*. This however, has a decent plot and the potential to be a solid show. Too bad its unwatchable as it promotes utter stupidity and goes as far as promoting black panthers like they were some heroic group. I was quite excited for this show, as I recall watching and enjoying the original quite a bit. In the end, it ended up being fairly disappointing for a number of reasons, though they did get a few thing right in my opinion. Anyways, the cons for this show appeared to be derived almost solely from the writing, though the acting was pretty sub par at parts and the blurry camera shots were eye straining at best, with pretty much every scene involving Sabrina at school or her friends being a mix of outright boredom or feeling completely detached from the rest of the plot and the satanic witch rituals came off a bit too over the top for me with a rather pointless insertion of cannibalism, etc. Now for the pros, I really liked the Riverdale, or perhaps Archie comics, tone and look with the setting providing a good backdrop for events, not to mention I thought making Salem silent was a good decision though they could have found more ways to make him relevant to the plot. Basically, I have seen worse witch shows recently, such as the new Charmed, however this show still came off poorly with seemingly alot of potential wasted though all the ingredients are still present so I have hope that a season 2 could be better if they learn from their mistakes. I wanted to love this show . I was completely fine with it not being like the sitcom . I love dark shows and witches but Sabrina is so annoying . The writing is so corny and Sabrina and Zelda speak so stuck up. Not because of Zelda's accent . When Sabrina goes of on her little rants her voice gets so uppity. And she's a terrible actor . Also do we really need to get political ? No one in high school acts like this . Sooooo bad It could be a good show, but it's not
Writers destroyed it with movie blurry effects, lack of any story, pc pamphlet propaganda...Shipka is lousy actress, casting is so wrong
Salem doesn't talk at all
Not worth of your time I'm sure there are a lot of things in this show that people will be offended by if they do not identify as a leftist/progressive. I wasn't offended but the show gets tiresome trying way too hard to go down the SJW checklist and cram so many feminist/minority/non standard sexual social topics in there as well as making the lead yet another mary sue cliche. For all of its progressive preachings, I was surprised the show stoops to cultural appropriation of christians and applies that same structure to a witch run church of satan, it just doesn't work for a logical setup even in a fantasy show. The show would be a whole lot better if it focused more on a convincing plot and coming up with original ideas rather than recycled and plagarised stories. I liked Keirnan Shipka and her aunts as well as a few other characters in this, they did the best with what they were given I suppose. The overreaching social agenda and dumbing down of the story makes this mostly just an echo chamber for NPCs rather than anything cerebral or captivating. Bad writing made this amazingly rubbish. Misguided effort and a total waste of time. It's as if the makers of this series were themselves confused which genre they wanted to adhere to. Complete waste of talent with a lot of questions that had to be answered to make things clear. That, and suddenly a smartphone pops up in a series set during the 80s! Who can explain that?! Shipka was herself annoying with her love story becoming more and more dull as time went by.Not good choice as Sabrina. Lucy Davis tried her best and it showed. In total, spare your patience and these series! I tried, I really tried and the one thing I was waiting for was for her friends and Harvey to find out that she is a witch and when did that happen??? On the last freaking episode, by that time I really don't care!<br/><br/>The best things about this show is Miranda Otto and after ep 6, her presence are felt less and less. And the weird sisters, they were good.<br/><br/>Worst things, how about everything else?
<ul><li>Salem not talking and come on get an actress who is not allergic to cats!</li><li>Sabrina looks like she's 10 yrs old so to see her snuggling and kissing harvey is not right. She looks like a child and everyone else much much older.</li><li>Trying to make Sabrina dark and yet casting a Disney lookalike is a bad idea. The actress who played Sabrina can't carry a murder without making it look cutesy. Sorry she's the wrong girl or this is the wrong direction.</li><li>the Satan thing is overdone, confusing, and all over the place.</li></ul> So I had really high expectations for this. I was expecting something close to Buffy and instead I see myself watching to a magic show with barely any magic, pretentious rude girls with barely any personality but the sheer will to disobey for the hell of it. I get it, discriminating is wrong, but this is way too much. There's an anti men message every 2 seconds. Seriously, witches criticizing their leader for being a man when he's not even human?. There's no depht in any character to make you like them at all. Hilda has barely any personality and Zelda is standofish and stuck up. The main character Sabrina is boring in general and the guys except for the black guy replacing the black cat have no personality at all. Is there a hidden message there? I seriously doubt they were targeting this show at any other person that is not a female teenager. So guys watching this, get ready to hear a lot of man bashing cause yes, in this show being a man is a sin. Real waste of a great opportunity to come up with a great product. I love that they took the original idea and made it modern and dark but the situations don't really end up keeping my attention. I live Sabrina's character but I don't feel very connected to any of the others. I also miss that Salem talked, was kind of hoping we'd see more of that. This tv show is fine, it's not the worst nor is it the best it's fine.
Also when someone is killed by rope around the neck the word is hanged. When the 13 were hung, it implies they were dangling in a tree and were not murdered by hanging. Really really annoying. Who the @&!'l are the writers for this show? I am pissed off with how they have made Wicca being devil worshiper. Wiccan are not devil worshipers. The writers must be Christian to say such things. Satan Is a Christian belief not Wiccan. Someone should have done their research before offering false information. I appreciate a darker story to the campy happy go lucky "Sabrina the Teenage Wictch", but very upset with how they have pertraded Wiccan. I'm scared as the session goes on to know what other false ideas they makeup about the Wicca belief. The look of the Devil/Satan was also created by Christians. Expoiting what a true Wiccan believes without fully understanding is appalling. Then you make a girl strength club in a school "WICCA"???? Wrong in so many ways. I am beyond angry with what the writers have done. They call the club in school WICCA... which we all know is spiritual path that some witches take in real life . The fact they named their club that suggests the writers of the show know absolutely nothing about being a witch to begin with. Being a witch has nothing to do with believing in or following Satan. This show is perpetuating stereotypes about witchcraft.<br/><br/>With that being said, I did find the show somewhat compelling. I did enjoy the plot despite the lack of insight. As previously mentioned by others, I do not like the blurry background. I thought something was wrong with my TV at first and switched to a different show to check.... nope just crappy filming. It hurt my eyes because I kept automatically squinting.<br/><br/>First I want to say I was so excited about this show and didn't want it to be anything like the first tv series. I was definitely interested in a darker version since I enjoy creepy anything but all the satan stuff.... come on!<br/><br/>It's an insult to Wicca, Christianity and I'm sure Satanist don't really want to be featured as cannibalistic fiends either that eat their own children. I was almost hoping for a darker Charmed to be honest. I definitely wanted demon hunting but wicca and satanism AREN'T the same thing. That kind of delusional thinking is what led to the Salem witch trials. Wiccans have tried to further themselves from this stigma and this show just throws it in their face. Also the not so subtle digs at Christianity are sickening. I am a firm believer of respect to others religions and this show is just so not cool. And I don't mind joking like Family Guy, Simpsons, South Park, etc. about religions but they do it well.<br/><br/>This show really had so much promise. I love the cast and acting. A lot of the plots have been very interesting. Just all the 'Hail Satans' and 'Satan bless us everyone'. Sooo over done an in attempt to be..... edgy?.... I assume. And Salem DOESN'T EVEN TALK!!!!! It's a shame because it would really be a good show minus all the Satan crap. I just finished watching the solstice one and I am officially done. I can't say I am offended by it but the show leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I watch MANY horror films (it's my favorite genre) but this one just is too much..... Every single part of the script is forged to support and push SJW political propaganda agenda. If it was a part of an episode that would be ok, The whole show? No, thank you.
And actings is horrible I am honestly lost on this show bc the plot is all over the place. I really only like it somewhat bc of Ross Lynch. I didn't know it was somewhat based on the original Sabrina series until the aunts showed up & i'm disappointed in how they casted them. I didn't watch the whole season bc after the sleep demon I fell asleep & just wasn't interested. I gave this series a chance but as many of you will see there will be a lot of people claiming propaganda. I don't feel it's not so much that but the series just wasn't for the older generation as much as the younger one. There are many cons to this reboot. Sabrina is a dislikable main character that likes to place herself at the center of attention by deciding how people should be around her and what's best for them. The secondary characters on Sabrina's magical side are much more interesting. Sabrina's character seems to be completely against being a witch unless it benefits her. I can't say I enjoyed this rendition of Sabrina as much as I could. Witches don't believe in Satan and it sucks what the pagan community will get from this show.<br/><br/>They really could've had a great show even with that mistake of pagan belief. Sabrina needed to be a witch but act like and practice witch beliefs from her universe. She disregards the beliefs and teachings of her witch culture and tries to outwit what the laws of her world. She either gets Dues Ex machina'd or doesn't ever feel she is ever in the wrong.<br/><br/>Skip this Sabrina the old Sabrina was way more adventurous and enjoyed being and practicing witch. It was also much more enjoyable and all the characters were loveable too. I have always loved magic in movies and tv shows. However this is not a show that I would ever watch again. Only saw one episode and that was more then I needed. Nope I'm good. I thought that the inclusion of Michelle Gomez would make this remake a hit. It doesn't. It is way too dark. The original series of Sabrina was light and funny. If this is intended for kids then I truly worry. Are you seriously going to introduce kids to Satanism? This is not something that you should even joke about. Far too many references to "The Dark Lord".<br/><br/>The acting is wooden, uncomfortable and forced. Not my cup of tea at all and I certainly won't be letting kids watch it. They are trying to showcase this show with it's supposedly more darker supernatural aspects, but it is actually just throwing out a couple of "satanic" words and calling it 'dark' . Don't be fooled by the marketing. The producers couldn't make up their mind about what they want with this series. Sabrina herself acts like one of those idealistic angry teenager whom thinks they will change the world with her activism.<br/><br/>What you do get are teenagers making goo-goo eyes with each other, or yapping away with political speech about patriarchy, vigilant feminism , transgenderism and the such every single time. Worse off is that they have nothing interesting to say about it. And in the first episode itself, you see Sabrina acting on perceived bullying by a 3rd party of a transgender with violence. Oh, what a great way to build a likeable character.<br/><br/>And of course, this is the type of show where there is a racial quota to fulfill. No mono-racial families and circle of friends here. It's like the rebooted travesty of Charmed.<br/><br/>And all the personality of the cat from the 90s tv series? Zippp. None to be seen. Don't even talk proper. This show is so terrible. The writing is poor, the acting is wooden, and is just overall awful. I'm so disappointed. It neither fun or clever. I gave it two stars because I didn't get through the first episode. If I'd finished watching it I suspect it would have been 1. Just nonsensical garbage wrapped in a PC tortilla. It could be much more if writers tried to make interesting plot instead forcing political agenda onto us. You find yourself half asleep as you watch Sabrina. It's just boring and for 10 hours not happened.
Acting could be much better. Shipka is not right choice for this role and she has wooden expresion on her face all the time, she doesn't show any emotion. I didn't like Sabrina, I can tell that she and her bratty friends ruined season 1. What is with that movie effect, everything is blur.
It could be so much better but writers & bad acting ruined it. The main thing is that new Sabrina tv show is boring
Like other people described before, there is no plot, there is no story. You could skip from first to the last episode and you wouldn't miss a thing.Acting is bad, I don't have any sympathy for Sabrina. I found myself cheering for Satan against Sabrina and her annoying friends.Movie effects are so bad, and show is pretentious and preachy.The weakest link in tv show is Sabrina herself, she is not likeable. And I will say this again- this is so boring! Disappointing.
Disney kids movies are scaryier than this series.
Also, where is all the magic and supernatural.?
Just boaring The only well developed character as of Season 1 is Aunt Zelda, and the show's sensationalism and ritualistic appeal are probably what make it so popular. Must have spent a ton of money on making everything look "pretty" and "witchy" and none on actually hiring talented actors. Not to mention the inaccurate representation of witches! Rude! I'm not sure if teenagers just adore this kind of political nonsense (or if Hollywood loves to take advantage of young and ignorant minds), but for a mid-twenties gal like myself, this is considered almost junk. I have watched thee episodes. I was really trying to hold on, but I am officially jumping off the wagon.<br/><br/>They took a great opportunity and soiled it with Hollywood propaganda. ATTN HOLLYWOOD: I do not appreciate far-left ideologies being throw down my throat at every turn. It's chaos and is not my idea of good cinema. Yack. I dont know what was up with the lighting on this show ,I could barely make out anyone 's features .That not the most annoying thing about this show unfortunately. The characters are difficult to invest in. I couldnt for the life of me understand what Sabrina sees in Harvey. Sabrina 's entire normal high school experience seems to be just one social cause after another . The timid aunt made no sense to me and she just didnt fit in with the rest .Ambrose seemed to have potential but they barely explored his storyline. Once again a streaming network has hired writers that write scripts that are too dark, too heavy, and too depressing. They need to learn to lighten up a bit and maybe take some writing hints from the people over at the Marvel movies (not the TV shows, they are too dark, too). Could be a good show, but I always feel depressed and sick after watching a couple of episodes. Not good for binge watching. This could have been a really fun show. It still is, really, if you cut out all of the high school scenes.<br/><br/>The devil as a character who is worshiped by most of our protagonists is nullified by a character saying "I'm gong blind in 3 months and I just really want to read this book but the PTA says I can't so my life is ruined." Girl, get on Amazon and buy the book. Then sign up for an Audible account and learn Braille. Don't waste time crying over it all or calculating exactly how many books you can realistically read before then. (No joke, she says that.)<br/><br/>And oh dear Satan, the politics. I'll be the first to admit that I'm a liberal thinker on almost every level, particularly social. But let's take a chill pill, okay? Don't sexually assault bullies. Or psychologically torture the principal so he'll take a couple days off. Or use your moral high ground as an excuse to do what your tormentors are doing but at least you're doing it to them. Another reviewer had it right when they called it "all or nothing politics." There's no nuance here. Sabrina doesn't make any real mistakes that make her sit down and reassess her beliefs. All teenagers are, at their core, extremists who develop the ability to see shades of gray. This show should push THAT instead of this social totalitarianism.<br/><br/>Positive things about the show:
<ul><li>The devil is pretty cool. They're doing the whole Jaws thing where they reveal snips and hints of him but don't parade him around to ruin the effect.</li><li>The character designs</li><li>Ambrose is a delight.</li><li>An actually believable depiction of a trans character that isn't a big deal. (In fact, I'd say ambiguously trans since I wouldn't have thought she was if it weren't for the bullies.)</li><li>The straight up witchy stuff is DARK.</li></ul> Well, my tittle says it all. It was hard to watch the first episode till the end. Been there, done that so many times, I simply cannot stomach unimaginative stuff like this anymore. Would never let kids watch this - it is damaging to their soul and mind, artistic sense, creativity, ... and unfortunately kids are the main target.
And by the way, witches should not be presented as satanic cult. The devil worshiping witches trope is a bit goofy, but still entertaining. The show would've been so much better without Sabrina's lefty teeny bopper friends and their super important activism. Politics dull entertainment. I was actually very excited when I saw that there was a new version on Netflix of Sabrina the Teenage Witch. I grew up watching the sitcom version and loved it. I was really into this new idea of making Sabrina darker and much more serious.
Within the first episode, I was a bit bored by it. But I figured it might be a slow start off and will get better as it goes on. To my surprise, it just kind of stayed the same.
The more I got to know the characters, the less I liked them. Sabrina seemed too bland and calm about everything. Harvey was too nice and perfect that it just made him uninteresting. Sabrina's friends and foes in her high school were too over the top, there was never a middle ground for them. Some of the witches were okay, Prudence was a good character. In fact, there really wasn't any character that I could call my favorite, except maybe for Salem, and he didn't even speak a word.
Although the characters were no help to make this enjoyable, I did like the cinematography and feel of the show. The music was good as well. My only complaint about part of the story telling is the weird glossy look they do on scenes whenever they are in the witches realm/presence. It made me feel like my glasses were smudged with oil.
And like some other reviewers have stated, I wasn't into the underlying strong feminist message. It just didn't do anything for me. Parts of the story seemed too forced to make things dramatic and as it gets to the end, sooo many things have happened.
I can see why some people would like this show, it's not absolutely terrible. But all in all, I think it's an okay watch. I'm hoping the second season does a lot better. Utter rubbish... sabrina is so annoying.. the whole plot is flawed..it's not suppose to be t the goody two shoes teenage drama but sadly it is √¢≈ì≈í Started watching Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, but can't get into it for many reasons. For one, I dislike the casual references to "killing." In one episode, Sabrina tells Ambrose, "I don't want you to hurt him (the principal) too bad." Two seconds later when she and Ambrose are casting a spell on the principal, Ambrose says, "Are you sure you don't want me to kill him? 'Cause I can."<br/><br/>Then in another scene/episode, Auntie Zee "kills" the other Auntie because "she was getting on my nerves." Of course, the Auntie comes back to life soon after... I also realize this is a dark show and that it's fiction, but in the murderous culture of today, I just don't like the casual references to killing anymore. This is a TEEN show and it just didn't sit well with me. Perhaps I'm getting old. There seems to be some man bashing going on too. As far as structure and theme... Not sure. My 2 cents. This show was once known as the best sitcom on tv. A sarcastic cat, a funny teen witch and two cooky aunts. What happened to those days? Oh wait, it's now filled with edgy teens who need a drama show of a terrible reboot. It tries to deal with real subjects with way too much camp. totally unfocused scripts and message. some of the outer characters are too simple and flat. the main family (aunts, cousin and sabrina) are solid enough, and they could have "addams familied" the stories more in that regard. some background stories are too thin and slow moving (Lucas and the knife murder, etc).<br/><br/>all in all, not bad; but definitely FOR 13 year old. never gets close to being half as good as Buffy (which was for 13 year olds AND adults). we made it through the whole season though, so it was at least vaguely entertaining and engaging. still, we felt it was a huge missed opportunity. I used to watch the original all the time! I love this genre so much but it all seemed so forced! That Sabrina didn't know basic facts about being a witch, their coven, their house, etc. made everything so unbelievable. I get exposition but to pull it so forcefully with no explanation. Something had been happening to an aunt her whole life and she doesn't ask questions about it or the process? The aunts and/or her cousin doesn't just explain witch stuff to her so she's prepared? I really felt there were a lot of convenient saves that were too convenient but then when something needs a save, all the sudden there isn't anything to help them?! I'm confused about the timeframe of being a witch or warlock as the show seems to bounce back and forth between 16 being the golden age and then having it be younger at times. Too many agendas as well! Felt like they were trying to pander to as many people as possible! Also, when is it set?! It really acts like 1960s in the beginning (vehicles, clothes, etc.) But the there are cell phones!? Very boring. The writing has so many holes it could as well be named The Chilling Swiss Cheese of How Not To Write Scripts, and it generally doesn't really make you care about any of the characters. It's fairly mystifying why Netflix already ordered a second season of this completely forgettable show.
Acting is awfull and the show is full of political agenda forced your throat... Who wrote this junk? So bad, can't even describe it. Wrong on so many levels. The show made me literally hate the actress. I loved the previous TV show, but this is stupid beyond believe. No season 2 for me. At start it was promising. I would of have enjoyed the show quite a bit. However, quickly so much propaganda was pushed, it was hard to enjoy at some points. There is nothing wrong with bit of it, but when things become centerpiece of some episodes, it become abundantly clear what is the aim here, and makes it cringy or annoying to watch. If the topics were left out, it would be far more enjoyable. Truly a shame this has infested netflix at this point. As a male watcher it felt like I am not welcome here, and I should gtfo of this space. A light, predictable coming-of-age mystery series with medicore actoing and wodden dialog which tries to score points with feminist encouragement and a release close to Halloween. A decent time-filler, but definitely Harry Potter successor. I hate-watched the entire thing, like some kind of ghastly train wreck happening in slow motion that I couldn't take my eyes off. We got The Satanic Bible as presented by the local high school drama club. I'll mention some problems that stuck out to me:<br/><br/>1. Sabrina turns 16 in the second episode, but in the first episode we see her completely naked, despite being filmed from a "tasteful" camera angle that hides all the naughty bits.
2. I am not hyper religious, but the belief systems of Anton Lavey and Aleister Crowley are quoted a few times, other times they writers use a cheap inversion of Catholic dogma and rituals as the basis of their dialogue, actions. eg: the characters often exclaim "Praise Satan!" when something goes right for them, or the "Book of Life" becomes the "Book of the Beast," "Baptism" becomes "Dark Baptism" etc.
3. SJW and Feminist propaganda is hammered and wedged and stuffed into every available place, and then some until the dialogue and plot practically drip with it. The girls make a club called WICCA (Women's Intersectional Cultural and Creative Association) to protect *all* women, in a not so subtle nod to transgenderism. Others have already labored this.
4. All the characters are terrible stereotypes that lack depth and nuance. Examples include: Sabrina: Angsty girl with a big choice to make. Hilda: Good aunt vs Zelda: Bad aunt (with a heart of gold) Harvey: dumb boyfriend who understands nothing, Nick: dangerous love interest threatening core relationship, Suzy: trans person that people don't know how to handle, Mr. Kinkel: abusive dad telling his kid to get a job, destroying their dreams, Madam Satan: conniving, mysterious character with their own agenda, Weird sisters: carbon copy of the popular characters from "Mean Girls" and a character I like to refer to as "Principal Trump". There is a scene where Sabrina approaches him and informs him that "a trans person is living in constant fear at his school" to which he tells her "maybe that person should find another school!"
5. Lack of characters, simple, predictable plot. My fourth point managed to capture most of the important characters in the show, and that's a problem. They just do not have a lot to work with here. The story is not complicated at all, which you can tell by the fact that the series is only 10 episodes long, despite more being in the works. The actual content could have been handled in 3 or 4 episodes had they dispensed with irrelevant side plots that went nowhere and contributed nothing to character development.... In this show's defense, it has a level of stylistic campiness that may be appealing to some, but it is never clear if the schlock is intentional. In other words, it takes itself way too seriously. The writing is corny and expository, and takes away from the very pushy political themes it adresses. Very few of the characters are likable. The acting does not help much either, as many of the performances are over-the-top, or generally unconvincing. Is it original and new? Perhaps, but that by no means makes it captivating. The acting is okay, not anything amazing, but the script is not great. The reactions from people do not seem genuine at points, while at other points they are spot on. The camera blur is a bit overdone at points and looks distorted rather than a cool addition to the cinematography. If you can get past this, the show is beautifully shot and the CGI is good most of the time, but at other points, it seems unpolished. The comedic relief isn't great, but it does help at points in the show. Overall the show is inconsistent with regards to most things except the acting which is about average or above average throughout the whole show. One major problem with the script I have is how political ideas are peppered throughout the show that don't add much value. Another problem is that most of the characters seem paper thin because of the lack of development throughout the show. I can't say the characters all feel this way, as Sabrina doesn't, but a lot of characters are cliches without real depth. Overall, it's not a terrible show, but it's certainly not good. It has it's ups and it's downs, but the show is, again, inconsistent. It is definitely not better than the original. Horrible acting. Tried to watch this on 2 different occasions and could not bring myself to watch a 2nd episode. The girl that plays sabrina is not a good actress at all. I. Just. Cant. After episode 5 it gets really weird. Writing is all over the place, and it turns into some weird 90s witches show with dead kids for dinner and satanic cult ... I did not make this up.
Writing is inconsistent and the "real world" stops being compelling fast, whereas the witches world is dark but simply too weird for anyone to care. Who is the audience of the show? Unclear. Not sure teens would be interested pass 4 episodes, nor adults. The harsh satanic imagery shows us that this show wants to be taken seriously, yet it's writing has the complexity and thoughtfulness of a Disney straight-to-dvd movie.<br/><br/>The show seems to be held back by the need to portray complex situations and characters in black and white terms. This may be due to the writers' political influence which is often blatantly present.<br/><br/>In one episode there is a trial after Father Blackwood accuses Sabrina of backing out with a deal with the devil and he actually argues that because Sabrina was wearing a wedding dress she "consented" to the deal. An obvious allusion to strawman "what was she wearing?" argument in sexual assault cases, completely nonsensical because Father Blackwood had legitimate evidence (Sabrina's name already written in the book of Satan) and no need for such an unbelievable argument.<br/><br/>Harvey's father continuously pressures his son into working and abandoning his passions to near abusive lengths. Instead of developing a nuanced relationship with Harvey and his father, his father is just painted as an evil abusive man. This could have been the perfect chance to portray a parent who so stubbornly believes they know what's best for their child they unintentionally hurt them and draw parallels to Sabrina's own family.<br/><br/>The "witch religion" (whatever it's called, I'll just call it Satanism) is just stereotypical Christianity replaced with Satan instead of Jesus. The religious organizations and its members are portrayed in an extremely negative light; being liars, manipulators, hypocrites who are willing to do awful things. Sabrina's
Aunt Zelda repeatedly rejoices over innocent people's deaths, Satanism literally practices cannibalism. Sabrina is supposed to feel torn between this religion and her human life yet I can't seem to find any reason to stay other than "woah i get cool powers."<br/><br/>The way this is written just seems very immature with it's black and white thinking, rebellion for rebellion's sake attitude, and lack of diverse perspectives. Update since last review: I actually finished the other episodes to give it one more chance, review still stands, in fact it's horrible. Only good thing is Zelda, Miranda Otto's play and the character development the only thing I can congratulate on. Otherwise ... horribly bad show.<br/><br/>I was a huge fan of the original Sabrina TV series when I was a child, I know this show is based on the comic books which I don't really know and apparently it takes a much spookier and darker tone than the other TV show. However it wouldn't be a problem for me if this show didn't have so many flaws.<br/><br/>First of all I only watched 3 episodes, that is all I could take. This show is not about witchcraft, witches and anything alike, rather it all comes down to the terrible clich√©s of witchcraft = Satanism thing, that is the biggest nonsense I've ever heard. I seriously don't get why the writers had to include Satanism and Lucifer into a show which is supposed to be about witches??? The two things are sooo not equal, even historically it is absolutely incorrect and only the bigotry and stereotypes would make such a direct relation. Then again back to clich√©s, didn't we have enough shows lately with Angels and God vs Dark Lord/Lucifer and demons, heaven and hell ... etc call them whatever you want? Supernaturals, Lucifer and so on and so on ... I just really wanted a show that centered around witchcraft and not get mixed with Christian ideas.<br/><br/>The acting most of the time is terrible, maybe it's not the actors fault, their characters are written in a horrible way, extremely overdoing the character types and such. The plot? Jeeeesh 3x50 minutes, and barely anything happened, boring, and what little happened I could predict almost instantly at the beginning of the episodes. Again boring and clich√©... I can't really understand some of the superb rating, it is just a big NO from me. Maybe I could watch it as a light afternoon fun if there weren't totally unnecessary scenes like one aunt killing the other right immediately (of course she comes back), hints of cannibalism (again, it didn't even make the scene darker, it was just ... ooookay this makes no sense, that sentence was just blown there like a total causal thing but nothing came out of it), and the Satanism mixed up with witches/wiccas. *sigh* At least make a few lines there that are funny ... This is just the first three episodes, the show might get better, but I would rather take a 50 minute walk in the cold winter day than waste my time and give this another chance... Unfortunately, like so many other recent shows, this take on the Archie's Sabrina is made dull by the writers.<br/><br/>On top of the entirely unnecessary soul-being-sold-to-the-devil plot device, the Sabrina character is just odd and not like the character in the comic. While Sabrina in the comics was always happy-go-lucky-confident in her ways (because she had magic on her side), this show's Sabrina tries that same happy-go-lucky level of confidence, but it comes off as neurotic dangerous rather than confident.<br/><br/>In places where Sabrina should be scared or worried, she beams positive confident for no reason. Like, for example, when she invites a rather ominous goblin to take the form of Salem and then she quips, "Such a cute kitty". In a comic format, this works. In a dark gritty realistic TV show, it doesn't work. In fact, it makes the character look mentally unstable and oddly scary. That's not Sabrina.<br/><br/>While I was expecting a similar level of darkness of the later Harry Potter series, what we get instead is satanic occultism with goat sacrifices. What was the point in these unnecessary plot elements? How hard is it to write a fictional nemesis for Sabrina that doesn't involve Satan? The writers are simply not even trying. I'm sorry, but this Sabrina series is entirely ruined by the unnecessary satanic elements. Now that the writers have opened this Pandora's box, they cannot close it. This means the series is doomed to repeat these satanic elements forever. That kind of message is not the reason I watch a witch show like this. Harry Potter never went down the Satan path. I Dream of Jeannie never went there. Bewitched never went there. Charmed kind of went there with the Demons, but never really went all the way there. Even the Sabrina sitcom never went there. So, why here, why now and why right out of the gate?<br/><br/>On top of this, Sabrina is supposed to be a witch who lives with two witch aunts and one witch uncle. Yet, there's rarely any magic performed and almost none by Sabrina. In the comic, Sabrina's happy-go-lucky personality combined with her witchcraft created a bumbling, but likeable character not unlike Jeannie from I Dream of Jeannie. She's a character who uses her magic to try and fix something making the situation worse. Then she'll end up having to undo it all by magic in the end. Yes, it's a pretty worn thin plot trope, but it would be preferable to this show where almost no magic is ever to be seen and the show is dominated by everything boring other than magic. How can you have a show full of witches and never perform any on-screen magic?<br/><br/>When Sabrina does perform magic, it's through her uncle who lives with her. She and he perform a spell on the principal that is so dark and horrifying that would likely see that principal quit and leave town. Yet, she plays it off as fun and helpful... again, dangerous neurotic. The principal comes back and doesn't even bat an eye after that ordeal.<br/><br/>Overall, the stories are more about Sabrina's want to stay in the mortal world with "her friends" over becoming a witch. I guess this kind of follows the comic, but at the same time that torn-between-two-worlds trope has been done before and done better. It's too bad the creators couldn't have come up with better ideas for this darker Sabrina. The show is just too odd and sends the wrong message with stories that just don't work.<br/><br/>The acting is decent including Kiernan Shipka as Sabrina. Unfortunately, it's the writing that's doing this show in and it's not even out of its first season. Feel free to watch it, but don't say you weren't warned of its content. The final thing that kind of annoys me is the casting of Keirnan Shipka who could double as Emma Watson's sister. Were they seriously trying to find an actress who looks like the film version of Hermione Grainger? Cant even make myself to finish the first ep. Booooooooring.<br/><br/>Can people in the review stop using the word AMAZING? This is the opposite of that! New Sabrina simply squanders it trying to push a specific agenda. That's not say I disagree entirely with the agenda being pushed, but you can't simply have your character, every 15 minutes or so, stand up and complain about the patriarchy. it's like every episode is centered around a college student's essay on the feminism, instead of, you know, maybe an actual story or plot-line. I would suggest skipping this and finding a show that has an actual story to tell.
Also, as others have mentioned, the whole "fuzzy edge" camera work is annoying and distracting. The acting is good, but anyone says the show is "deep" or "clever" is simply full of it. Collapse Because she doesn't really know her witch side, their true beliefs and customs, Sabrina is against almost everything they do. She essentially browbeats everyone to make them and everything conform to her mortal beliefs. I don't even understand the purpose in this series realistically. I say this because it's the story of a half witch trying to make all the other witcheslike her. Ironically, what is truly entertaining are the "whole witches". So to watch this and see that, because she doesn't believe in something, she can have a hissy fit and then get things her way is a drag! Loved the original Sabrina. A lighthearted story about a witch, her goofy cat, aunts, and teenage problems. A show that you can watch any time, any episode and have fun. This version, except for the fact that the Sabrina actress looks very much like the original, has little similarities.<br/><br/>I can't think of any pros but i can up with tons of cons: 1) it is very slow moving, 2) Sabrina, the protagonist is an annoyong "know it all," 3) there is the Dark Lord, satanism, demons, cannabilism, hell, monsters in a mine, and other creept gross things which are all over-emphasized over the witches theme, 4) the show takes itself extremely serious, there are very few moments of lightheartiness, 5) the show is too dark!!! (And by dark i mean I can't see it! I live in the Southwest...lots of sunlight, windows, skylights, I actually can't watch the show during the day), and lastly, 6) like every show in the 21st century, it has tons conspiracies, so episodes have to be streamed consecutively.<br/><br/>Remember Reaper? The hilarous CW show, where the son of the devil and his slacker co-workers at Home Depot battle demons. Why can't they produce shows like that...a fun balance betwee teen angst, demons, and comedy? Everyone takes the demon demon fantasy shows so serious!! Not good, even for mindless entertainment. Riverdale is a good guilty-pleasure show, but Sabrina is just boring. I try and give this series a try since throughly from episode one it had potential then it collapsed really bad.no other word after that see it yourself and decide First of all the acting is horrendous. They seem to be reading from a script and the acting without emotion. Sabrina's acting is bland and with emotions and is never believable. I agree that every episode is choppy and has no correlating and strange plots. I can't decide if Sabrina is sweet and innocent or just oppositional defiant especially since she doesn't denounce her family's sadistic and evil ways. I'm confused on her morals and intentions. It's boring but it is spooky enough to keep me watching since I have nothing else to do. I can see myself losing interest quite soon though. Again I cannot believe how cheesy and scripted and emotionless and bland... also why aren't the friends more afraid of the ghosts and stuff. Their fear and concerns are just not believable. There's no jeopardy. None. We know she grows up to be a teenage witch then goes off to college, so let's not pretend she's ever in mortal peril. Find me another hook? There's some clever writers, you can do it.<br/><br/>Whilst you're at it, please hire Michelle Gomez another voice coach. Or even better, just let her use her own voice. She is a fabulous actress, wonderful to look at and fills every role she's ever taken, full of awesomeness. Except for when she speaks in This show and I'm transported to any of a thousand park benches in the UK, occupied by a drunken Glaswegian.<br/><br/>The cast is really strong. Please, give them a script and storylines to reflect their talent. Lighten up a bit too. I couldn't care less what path Sabrina chooses. Neither are exactly free of teen angst or dreariness. At least Buffy had some humour. And she clearly provided some storylines along with Supernatural.<br/><br/>And to the director: THERES NO SHAME IN HAVING YOUR CAMERAS IN FOCUS.<br/><br/>I won't give up on you. I still have visions of marrying Mellisa Joan, so I feel I owe it to myself. Gotta love Hollywood. They put out dumb melodramas like this. Please let these fanboys like Abrams and Joss whedon and this guy who created this.... Who is a fanboy of Joss whedon stop making this drivel. Garbage soap opera TV masked as a horror/fantasy show. I glanced over an article a few days ago that said this show was worth watching, so I decided to go for it. They were wrong.<br/><br/>Not even 30 minutes in and there is already more talk about patriarchy, masculinity, white privilege and other far left buzzwords than about anything that the series is supposedly about. If that's your cup of tea, then I see no reason why you wouldn't like this show. But if you don't like far left ideology being pushed as some sort of irreproachable moral standard, then this show might not be for you.<br/><br/>I decided to stop watching after about 25 minutes. But by all means, watch the first episode and see for yourself. The political stuff is, I guess, to be expected. As this is on Netflix. But my problem is that it makes no sense even within the story. The story seems to be set in some 1950s world, with the cars being 1950s models and no smart phones or social media. However, the 50s did not have transgenders or WOKE anything or black panthers. Then, Sabrina is some pseudo feminist, I guess.. demanding that she will not bend the knee to the devil... or I guess any man... but for the entire series she is joined at the hip and brain with Harvey. Harvey this, Harvey that... Sabrina never makes a single decision without thinking about what he wants, every decision she makes has to do with Harvey. Sister wives have more independance than her. Sabrina is supposed to be special. Valued by the dark lord and witches but Sabrina never embraces it - largely because she fears Harvey not being happy with it, which, he isn't. Lets just get into the scatter shot plots. At one point and entire plot line is dropped. Others come up and are gruesome and unnecessary not advancing the plot. I thought it did improve at the end but I think it needs new writers. I tuned in but won't again if there isn't improvement. I enjoyed the original program when I was younger & was interested in seeing the new darker take.<br/><br/>The camera work is a bit unusual & the fish eye view is annoying but overall I was starting to quite enjoy the first episode despite there being a few tropes. That was until the spouting of political rhetoric, a boyish (trans?) girl is assaulted at the school but the head teacher isn't even interested because he's a white male.<br/><br/>Then the talk about smashing the "white patriarchy" which if such utterances were made about any other single demographic would be considered completely unacceptable.
Lastly the talk of establishing a Black Panthers youth club. That was when I turned it off. Favorite line of the series:<br/><br/>"I have some reservations about saving my body for the Dark Lord." I doubled over laughing at this line.<br/><br/>I like Miranda Otto, Lucy Davis, Michelle Gomez, and Richard Coyle. They seem to be the only ones having any fun at all with the campy gothic vibe. Everyone else is so painfully earnest that it started to grate on my nerves within a few minutes. The show takes a "tell, don't show" approach to its politics, making it heavy-handed, shallow, and boring. The race- and gender-minority characters are tokens, not representation. Sabrina's "feminism" appears to be all show, no substance, like it was written by someone who read a Take Back the Night pamphlet 23 years ago. The show wants, so badly, to have an original take on Satanism as a promotion of free choice, rather than evil, but also wants to have the Satan-worshiping characters totally cool with murder and cannibalism. They're trying to have it both ways, and just failing at both. Plus, it's like they think we're going to forget that everything in the supernatural world is sinister, so they have to remind us constantly. It's not a baptism, it's a "dark baptism." It's not the infirmary, it's the "infernal infirmary." I'm waiting for someone to say, "Let's meet in the spoooooky student lounge," or "I want an eeeeeeerie bagel!" (best read in silly ghost voice)<br/><br/>The show just can't quite commit to being Penny-Dreadful-dark or Addams-Family-camp. Both of Sabrina's worlds seem so unappealing that there are no real stakes. Her friends are milquetoast approximations of "issues that young people care about" and the magical world is just.so.dreary. If it leaned into the campiness harder, it could be great. The actors who do camp it up are proof of that. As it is though, it's a boring, unfocused, over-earnest mess. Main actress is beauty..but the acting is no good..the drama is to boring I am sorry, but this show it's quiet boring! I don't bite to the charecters at all. Something is wrong with this show. I expected much more.
I just finished 4th episode, but no more. Not a single character is likable for the first like 4 episodes. Everyone is bad and nobody is doing what they should be. The reason I gave it a 5 was because the actors are great. #metoo wet dream, but if you are a straight bloke avoid this..or better yet, find Van Helsing. I really did, but this "modern" (supposed 1960's but had a scene with a smartphone) is pretty much one politically correct lesson after another. They did their best to promote satanism as normal, just and good, whereas Christianity is the 'false' religion.<br/><br/>Was I hoping for a complete redo of the 90's sitcom? No, but I did hope it followed a little closer to the formula. This is nowhere near it and if you are hoping for a show that multiple generations could enjoy, this is not it. This is not a show for children and its indoctrinating storyline is really not for anyone with an IQ over fifty.<br/><br/>One last thing, Salem is just a black cat in this version. I guess having a talking cat was too unrealistic in the writer's eye. I was so excited for this I love Sabrina I even have a cat named Salem who is 17 years old. But right off the bat its just political. Why couldn't they have made a show about a teenage witch and leave it at that? Every episode starts with a ritual or a trial or anything that Sabrina disagrees with. She then moans on with a look of shock throughout said episode basically going against anything anyone says or advises her to do. I would love one episode where she gets invested and it could be more light hearted.
EPISODE 7 doesn't even make any sense in several ways. 1. The ritual happens every year but this is the first time Sabrina has ever heard of it!!! 2. Why would Zelda get picked to take part as she is the Midwife for Father Blackwood. Nuff said! Miss I'm not sure about this one. I loved the original Sabrina which I know was just as badly acted and silly as this version. Apart from the better filming & CGI etc. the old Sabrina was better. I preferred the innocence of the old TV series. Why does everything for teens have to be so sexualised, and in tern ends up feeding into some wierd kink/paedophile/child sexualisation? Sabrina is a school girl so WTF with all the orgies etc? It's normalising paedophilia and appealing to an older male pervy audience rather than the girl/young woman that it should be (of course, why would I expect any better when hollywood loves to do that?!) On the plus side - I like the plots, the normalising (albeit sexualising) of a gay relationship and the non-gender stereotype conforming girl (yes we can stay girls and not conform to femininity, it happens) & I like Sabrina's style but bring back the innocence of the old sabrina. Plus do something about the story line holes - are they pagan, witch or evil? It's too much of a mishmash of all three I was excited based on previews but after the pilot I don't think I can watch anymore. The "what year is this" idea is fun and I've seen it used successfully elsewhere but it doesn't really work here (it's the 1960s, but woke!). Sabrina is played in a very polished, actor-ly way, which works against the dark vibe the show is otherwise trying to establish. While I understood that it was going to be darker than the 90s sitcom, I was not quite expecting this. I can understand the idea of the dark baptism and the world of the night as any religion that includes "witches" has been very secretive until the the latter part of the 20th century and there is a lot of misconceptions about how many are organized. I was a bit taken back about the writing in the book of the beast and seems to be about the stereotypical idea of satanism than what we know as the Church of Satan and Anton LeVey. Levey's idea was total free will, the idea that women were equal to men or even more so given they create life and can channel their "power" because of it. LeVey was about sex, some drugs and rock and roll which was my generations way of saying "party on dude" and were not necessarily "evil" as many would believe.
While Sabrina was not completely evil, the idea of a series showing a more evil and menacing Satanism was a bit confusing. However, having a song by Charles Manson was also strange as well as the contempt the "witches and warlocks" seemed to have for mortal humans made it seem more elites than anything and what was very confusing was that they also played music from the Hippie era that was not menacing that seemed counter to the Dark Church's theme or atmosphere.
Hilda was very different than Zelda, both played by great actresses as I am a fan of both. Hilda was more tolerant, kindly, sympathetic with no animosity toward the mortal humans and it seemed to show her similar to the Weasley family who liked the Muggles and thought of them as not very different than the Witch/Wizard community. In fact, she seems to like the mortals and this is proven true when she takes a job at a bookstore. SHe is nurturing and quiet maybe even shy and is very different than her twin Zelda and does not want to see the mortals harmed or bothered unless it's necessary for the greater good of all while Zelda, at least in the beginning, thinks of them as less than.<br/><br/>One thing I thought was interesting and left me wondering if there are more "witch" communities different than the Dark Lord's church and that was the name of the girls group Sabrina and her friends start, WICCA. Wicca if anybody doesn't know, is an Earth based religion where the practitioners assimilate into the larger community, do no harm and helps others with teas, soups, bathing salts and things more positive. Less scary and more healing where anyone can leave the community if they choose and still be a part of things the community does. I am wondering if that is there for future episodes and season where an actual WICCAN community moves into Greendale and settles there and are at odds with the Dark Lord and the Church of the Night and brings with them creatures and lore with them to Greendale but do it in secret and fighting against the High Priest's agenda and not making themselves known. I would not mind seeing a WICCAN community move into Greendale and secretly working against the Dark Lord and maybe attracting Church of the Night's members to them. See, this is where I see Hilda being a part of and rejecting the way of the Church of Night and it will be interesting if that happens. Maybe in some way, Sabrina called out to them without knowing it.
Zelda is a competent person who wants things her way, doesn't care about causing pain to others usually but also has this need to nurture as well but rarely shows that to people.
It would also seem that not everyone is too keen on everything the High Priest is about or the Church like Ambrose who seems more free spirited with Hilda and can recognize a very dark path when he sees it. I wonder if he would like to be free of the Church as well.
Things they didn't address were what actually happened to Sabrina's parents, does Sabrina have a sibling or twin or if Sabrina truly gives herself to the Dark.
I kept getting annoyed with Sabrina for not knowing what NOT to do such as resurrect Tommy like she did and doing things without thinking about the consequences. At times I wanted to slap her even though I know she meant well. Instead of an entertaining, edgy spin on Sabrina I felt like I was watching a modern day After School Special on diversity. It was almost comical at how hard it tried. Not only is Sabrina's close circle of friends a packet of skittles- she references attending a friends bar mitzvah and another friends quinceanera. Did I mention this takes place in a Hallmark inspired small town? I find the witchcraft more believable than her array of friends. *gotta collect em all!* TV14? Really?!?! Because of the amount of blood, gore, and violence in this show it should be rated MA! But because there's little profanity, it's not? Jack Nicholson once said, "Suck a tit, it's rated R. Cut it off, it's rated PG13." Why?!?!? Fix the rating before you parents let their 13 year olds watch it! I didnt like this series mainly becoz sabrinas character was worse...she was interfering in every matter which made me annoyed.atlast she signed that book that was supposed to be signed in the frst so that all this would never hav been hapened.. I've watched the entire series and I have to say it was pretty okay except for the political and anti-christian stuff they try to push down on the people. The first 2 episodes are really politically charged with liberal agenda being pushed down on the viewers. After that it calms down, but it does take a lot of indirect jabs at Christianity and conservative thoughts. God is constantly called 'False God'. And the inability of God to act when the witches 'Dark Lord' provides them protection is highlighted several times even though most of the times the mortal beings suffer because of the acts of witches. It is almost misandrist and does not give out a good impression on normal men. Also things like murder/cannibalism and other wicked stuff is completely treated as no big deals, whereas other stuff like women's rights, transgender rights are more focused and exalted. Women manipulating men to get what they want is treated as okay, since men are seen as bad. Harvey, Sabrina's love interest is almost certainly treated as an almost dumb character who never is smart enough to suspect what is going on. Honestly the best character in the entire story is someone who is not that important. Its Tommy, Harvey's brother, who made all the sacrifices necessary for his brother, who is the best character and selfless. All in all, the story has some good twists, but the poor logic and ill treatment of men and Christian thought make this show more of an agenda rather than a show to sit back and enjoy. I absolutely loved the original Sabrina the Teenage Witch series. I remember watching it as a young child and now can relive those memories watching it on Hulu. With that said, this edgy, horror remake is pretty bad. The actress portraying Sabrina is sub-par at best. The political correctness of the show is also going to make this feel dated in ten or fifteen years. This is a shallow attempt at creating the magic of Sabrina.<br/><br/>In the show's defense; however, I couldn't make it all the way through the first episode. Maybe it gets better. That's why I didn't give it a flat-out one star rating. If you like the concept of Sabrina mixed with the darkness of American Horror Story: Coven or AHS: Apocalypse then there's a chance you'll like this. In all honesty, this wasn't for me. . As someone who enjoys watching bad shows for ironic enjoyment it was a real surprise for me how much of a terrible show this is. It's simply completely garbage I nearly couldn't finish it, wich is something really impressive, I've seen terrible things before, really bad things, but this takes the cake.
The plot is shallow, the characters are unlikable and everything seems out of place.
It just doesn't work, the goddam misplaced gore scenes,as how NOT to do television. Stay away from this. As a fan of the old sitcom, I had no expectations for this to be the same. If it was, I would stop watching...<br/><br/>I wanted it to feel different and it completely delivered. Some scenes felt strange, but the vibe was interesting and I was willing to pop a bag of popcorn and rest my head heavy on my pillow... was...<br/><br/>Before I could stuff a second handful of buttery goodness down my throat I choked on politics.<br/><br/>I'm not against political leaning being displayed in fictional art. We produce what we believe in and that is a good thing. There is a rule, however: The stronger the politics, the smaller the audience.<br/><br/>The audience will be small for this show... incredibly small. They will also be loud. They will praise the political atributes, develop nausea from the overused blur effect, and like many cults.... claim the Chilling Adventures of Sabrina to be a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Honestly... It won't be. Money will be poured into the show and dirt labeled "powerful and progressive" will be produced. (That is to say that the show will not be worth much, like dirt... it won't make money)<br/><br/>If you're looking for a good Sabrina story or horror series, look elsewhere. This show will fail.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Next is an opinionated spoiler...<br/><br/><br/><br/>The politics behind this show are not powerful and progressive... they are regressive, racist, sexist, and the prime audience... young Americans, will not watch this show because of it.<br/><br/>So burn your money while it lasts... the flames will die quickly and hopefully Sabrina will be remembered as a hilarious sitcom, not an acrid horror series. This show is so utterly boring. It has no clear story line and is so scattered. The characters are one demensional and often I would forget about them until they had a scene. Nothing about this is good. I'm all for all the diversity, but just because you throw a lot of that into the show doesn't mean you can't have a catchy story line as well. I hate the time I wasted on giving this a chance. This drama was utterly and completely depressive. It continues to show a dark scenery, and consistent portrayal of feminism, patriarchy, fascism, etc. Would not recommend. The first episode is the only decent part of this series. The rest of the episodes are mediocre at best if your not familiar with the old Sabrina. For those that loved the original Sabrina The Teenage Witch, don't get your hopes up with this one. It is far from the happy, bubbly, magical version that we once loved so dear. Now if your into the current wave of political nonsense mixed with satanic rituals, well this ones for you. Jeez the crap this things spews. Love the Christian writers making witchies and wiccans, satan worshipers. Hey let's make then dull too! It's a good production and could have been a great show, but Sabrinas actions doesn't affect her in any way, there are no consequences. And she doesn't care who she hurts, only it isn't her high school boyfriend, which is stupid.. and even if she damages her familys reputation, something they care dearly about, she doesn't care, but no consequences, so why should she?? I don't like this show very much because her destroying actions and then it has no impact on the show. Ok I know I shouldn't expect more from netflix been pretty hit or miss on their shows and movies lately. And since this title has a lot of reviews already Ill keep it short.
First 3 episodes I had to double check I was watching netflix and not the CW
Teenagers check
Gay guy check
Transgender lesbian check
black best friend check
adult bashing check
White male bashing check
Violence that seems ok even if for no reason check
Plot holes check
weird camera filters check
If there is going to be a second season and thats a big if....hash out your plot lines better back off on your "messages" and get a better cinematographer I'M RATING THIS JUST ON THE FIRST EPISODE.<br/><br/>I over all like the idea of a dark Sabrina. I think the idea of it is pretty cool. This show could of been so much better if it wasn't for the level of cringe it has. Now that being said and out of the way here is what I don't like about this show based on just the first episode.<br/><br/>1 the girl who plays Sabrina sucks. it gets kinda hard to take her seriously when hes using terms like "groovy" unironically. Over all her acting skills are weak and they would of picked someone so much more better. Just look at 11, she is great.<br/><br/>2 The sjw/feminist views on this is so strong it gets annoying. There's nothing wrong with women empowerment, but when a show tries to shove it down your throat ever other cut scene it gets kinda annoying. Like in the part where she talks about why does the dark lord get to choose what she does with her body. How about when they try to shove women empowerment in scenes that has nothing to do with it? or turning the word WICCA into an acronym for their little club when in reality there is a community of actual wicca people and it has nothing to do with sjw.<br/><br/>3 Using the word "racist" when they haven't shown anything racist in the school. They just like to throw this out out there at random to try to be Woke. How are you going to throw the word racist out there when you haven't shown any form of racism?<br/><br/>Now if you can deal with the level of sjw cringe that's repeated over and over and over almost every cut scene, then this is a good show. Getting political to try to fit in and make a show "good" isn't the way to do it. There's more then just sjw watching Netflix. There is so many good Netflix shows that have been done without having to throw a narrative out there. There are some shows that are good that have a narrative but aren't as cringe worthy to watch as this one because it's just so badly placed that it makes you wan to turn the darn thing off.<br/><br/>over all id give it a 2.5 out of 5 I've watched two episodes and it was boring and dragged out. There's not really anything intense besides what happens to Mrs.Wardwell. I thought I'd enjoy this remake but I didn't. There seemed to be way more diolouge that really had nothing to do with Sabrina and the actual plot. Riverdale is more interesting than this and it's the same producers for both shows! When I saw trailer. I was really hooked cause I remember when I was little I used to watch cartoon of the same. But then it came and it was huge disappointment. Only some selected people in the world will enjoy this. The show has nothing special to offer. Some of the decisions Sabrina makes are so stupid it makes you want to just stop. trashThis show doesn't have a awful story,
this kind of show maybe work in 90's,
they just made a shitty horror movie which is too long it became tv series, if its a movie then it may be justified but Netflix is just going down not going up in terms of choosing good stories and last personally for me story comes first everything is second. Overall: it's alright<br/><br/>First off, I know this show is an adaptation of a series of Sabrina comics, not a remake of the show. BUT-<br/><br/>I still miss the humor and charm that the sitcom provided. Like, now that the show is a dramatic thriller it's not allowed to have ANY humorous moments?<br/><br/>But that's all subjective. Here's the objective review of the FIRST EPISODE ONLY:<br/><br/>The acting is pretty mediocre for television. If you're a fan of the characters in CW shows, you'll probably find the acting to be enjoyable, but overall, the characters talk like they're reading off a script. There are even some moments where the actors actually flubbed a line or two and the director just went with it. Also, EVERYONE is overdramatically portrayed. Especially the villain who chews the scenery every time she's on screen. Could be comedic or satirical, but no, it's played COMPLETELY straight.<br/><br/>The story in the first episode is pretty standard for a TV show and ends with a nice little cliff hanger. I won't spoil, if you'd like to see it, but to me the end wasn't interesting enough to make me want to move on to episode two.<br/><br/>One thing I'd like to praise HIGHLY are the special effects. Any nightmare or vision Sabrina has in this episode was portrayed perfectly. The imagery and cinematography was masterful in those scenes. Any other scene in the episode was pretty drab and boring . I'm so tired of dramatic shows being lit in flat, dull lighting.<br/><br/>Oh and also there's a subplot that has to do with a transgender student that is SO forced. I'm not gonna say another word on it though because I'm sure it's already been beaten to death by other reviewers. When will production companies realize that this isn't necessary?<br/><br/>And I give the first episode a 4/10!<br/><br/>Thank you for taking the time to read my review! Producers and writes missed opportunity to make amazing goof show. Instead we got teenage angst, political propaganda, bad actinng, bad writing
I hope season 2 will be better
This is too bad, too sloppy The trailer looked super boring, but I gave it a go just in case it was not awful.
On the bright side, though, the show lives up to that hype of seeming boring and not worth watching.
I didn't make it all the way through the second scene in the first episode before I got bored and turned it off. Ok so, I'm not quite sure where to begin. I'm now 3 episodes in deep and I'm quite astonished at how blatantly satanic this show is. Normally witches took part in witch craft but was geared towards being on a much 'lighter' note. I guess times have changed. I grew up watching Sabrina the sitcom, reading the books, watching the cartoons on the weekends and playing the game on my gameboy so yes, I'm a huge fan.<br/><br/>Sabrina in this Netflix series is nowhere near Emma Watson also I'm not a fan of the aunts. The whole storyline is a bit off and weird. Nevertheless, this show is entertaining enough to keep me distracted while I wait for my new Netflix series to come back into season. I expected more from this. what we got is pc propaganda and dull plot.
Actress who plays Sabrina is horrible in her role... her friends are annoying and movie effects are out of focus...
this is one hot mess and I don't recommend anyone to watch new version of Sabrina... and show itself is boring... The baizuo is strong with this show, do not recommend. This could have been better. The acting was good and the production values were pretty good except for that blurring thing they did around the edges, wtf was that all about? The story-line was pretty lame and it still has no idea where it's going. Another thing that bothered me was that most of the characters seemed cliche. It didn't make any sense that in the beginning of the series, satan could see and hear everything but then later on, he was not as involved as he had been.<br/><br/>A few things that ticked me right off; Susie the bullied friend that dresses like a boy. I'm fine with her dressing like a boy and it's fine that her aunt from back in the day used to dress like a boy but if it's not part of the story then for crying out loud, drop it. Roz, the outspoken friend who is going blind. For god's sake, why the tears about books that have been banned? Don't be a tool. Buy them and read them at home. Ambrose the gay cousin under house arrest, but finds a lover at a funeral, really? There was more but you get my point.<br/><br/>The writing is pretty bad. The aunts, have moments of good dialogue but for the most part the writing is shallow and obtuse. For someone who supposedly has amazing critical thinking skills, Sabrina gets tricked.<br/><br/>So, yeah, not impressed with any of it and will not return to watch season 2. Salem, the best character, doesn't talk. The whole family is now satanic, Zelda says "praise Satan" a few times per episode (which is funny at first, but wears thin) and that's purely silly manufactured 'edgyness'.
The whole show thinks it has a nessage, but it fails to deliver. The morality isn't character driven. Just preachy. Sabrina has a problem with hunting, but not animal sacrifice. No thought put in whatsoever.
There are no jokes. At all.
I like the teacher who was in doctor who, and the new cousin character, but that's not enough. I won't be continuing. I was so excited for this show after Riverdale, but it was a snoozer.<br/><br/>The actors suck - SORRY! They're terrible.<br/><br/>The script is worse. It's not smart, it doesn't flow, and it's cardboard, much like the characters themselves.<br/><br/>It was dull. Not worth the time. Writers used this show to force their Social justice Political propaganda. You had opportunity to make good tv show, but you messed with blurry efects, bad effects, and Shipka is not a god actress and it is dull and boring.Don't waste your time Let's see, this show is the complete opposite of the old comedy, and I would have to say blatant Satanism! The premise of the show is that Sabrina is supposed to sign her soul over to Satan himself, but gets cold feet. In the end she does anyway, which negates any hope of choosing good. Her aunt frequently will utter "praise Satan", and refers to God and the false god. Satanists must be rejoicing as they now have a show for them to watch in the mainstream. I do actually like the CW show Riverdale, for the most part, but this new Sabrina must make the Archie comic creators roll in their graves! I was so ready to love this, the tone is great the characters are great and the story is layered and compelling. But the cinematography is so blurry and out of focus 98% of the time it will actually strain your eyes to watch it. Such a disappointment as the sets and colour palate (when it's in focus) really does fit the entire aesthetic.<br/><br/>Such a shame to ruin it as they have. Basically brought 'witches' back to the dark age. Satan is nothing to do with witches....but now it will be once again. Welldone.<br/><br/>I don't mind it not being like the original, was too fluffy for me anyway. But there is so much folklore or information out there to make an interesting supernatural story without it being false.<br/><br/>such a shame. I am very unsure as to why this is currently sitting at an average of 8/10. This is not good. Do not recommend watching. I could barely watch the first 15 minutes of it. Then I found something more interesting to do, like watching paint go dry. Political oriented TV serie, anti-white men promotion, feminism predation, bad acting Sabrina actress without natural expression. New Sabrina is not good and it's overhyped without a reason
Sabrina is Mary Sue, she can do anything, she is the center of the world... Kiernan Shipka is awful choice, cause she can't act...I didn;t like horrible movie effects, neither slow story, I would tell that there was no story in this mess
I would not recommend this even to my worst enemy I liked the concepts of witches and their lives as well as their connection with the mortal world but I am amazed to see in this case how anyone could picturized it that much bad.i watch the starting 2-3 episodes thinking that it would get better but it does not and it literally like torcher to the minds, the whole first season.I admire the Sabrina team on how consistent they were, even if it is for there awfulness. By far the worst season I have ever completely saw. I honestly don't think that anyone could mess anything anymore than Sabrina team has done. I'm all for making the show a little darker than the original, but this went too dark. Too political as well. The writing was also all over the place. 1 episode of the original Sabrina the Teenage witch was better than this whole series combined. What a waste I'll start with a positive, the look of the show is beautiful, and the dark satanic magic and murder seemed to be an interesting take on what's been done before and that's what drew me to it. The costumes and sets are lovely and go with the dark witchy vibe BUT it's like they spent all their time and money on that and then the plot was just an after thought, It's all over the place. There are so many inconsistencies within the story. Sabrina knows so little for being raised knowing that she was a witch and being raised by two witch aunts with a warlock cousin. I get that it is a show about a teenage girl but how are we supposed to believe that her high school problems are comparable to the fact that the DEVIl! Is out to get her? she's a witch so I could understand her being able to get over magical things happening and being able to explain them to herself but bad/scary things happen to all of the characters including the mortals and then two seconds later It's like "oh well" and is rarely brought up again. I could maybe find the show a bit more enjoyable if the main characters were being played well but the bad writing is made worse by bad acting. I have many problems with it but overall I am left disappointed by this mess of a show. If you care about your kids you would absolutely not let them watch this junk along with 90% of all Netflix productions. It's brainless, propagandistic, and ungodly. If you don't want to disgrace Jesus don't watch this stuff and binge it, and rate it 10! I guess some people really do take enjoyment in sinnery and think it's cute and fun. Well not me and plenty of other intelligent people. This show is for freaks. I love magic and fantasy, but using dark magic and satan worship as the heroine's power source is not artistic its simply creepy and bizarre! The original was much better. It was bearable to watch if your bored It's ugly, but I can't look away. I can see what they're trying to do with the girl power thing, and the smash the patriarchy vibe. The problem is, real witches don't worship Satan. This is obviously written by people out of touch with pagan folkloric concepts, playing into the hands of Christians. Not good at all, the writing has so many holes it could as well be named The Chilling Swiss Cheese of How Not To Write Scripts, and it generally doesn't really make you care about any of the characters. It's fairly mystifying why Netflix already ordered a second season of this completely forgettable show..... I was expecting a darker more adult themed Sabrina that would both remind me of the show from my childhood and introduce me into the new dark world...What a bummer.. At first I thought there was some deep dark secret surrounding Sabrina and the Dark societey of witches. Everyone seemed to be in on it and man did it seem dark. When it was finally revealed ...I just stopped watching.<br/><br/>This show unfortunately tried way too hard to be a LGBT and feminist movement. The result is a very boring first couple of episodes.<br/><br/>I was so excited to leave this mundane town and see this Dark school...BUt no..we stay here. The demon threat kind of goes away and the suspenseful opener dissolves into nothing. And Salem is just thrown in there for reference...but does not actually do much I just watched the first episode, and stopped with 15 minutes left because I had to attend to something, but now don't feel like going back to watch it, nor the rest of the episodes.<br/><br/>It's not much fun to watch. The only parts I enjoyed were the banter between the Spellman family and the interaction between Sabrina and Harvey. However the rest of it depended on an apparent and basic contradiction... you as viewer are expected to like Sabrina and her family but they literally worship the devil! Not that I have anything against using the devil as a storyline in movies and books but the Spellman family says when a witch or warlord turns sixteen they are expected to sign the book of the Dark Lord, also named as Satan. Did they write that script correctly? Hello? Satan in literature and in common knowledge is against good, honor, and decency... so is Sabrina and her family admitting they want to support evil? Even a fifteen year old would have a moral compass--heck, probably a ten year old too. In effect, signing a pact with the Dark Lord contradicts everything Sabrina nominally stands for... friendship, respect, selflessness, human rights, and so on.<br/><br/>Sorry. If a show is that morally confused and they are asking us as viewers to disregard basic values then I don't buy it. It is a very fundamental contradiction within Sabrina that just knocks her down as a main character.<br/><br/>If on the other hand the Spellman family has always been an outcast family, fighting hard against the Dark Lord, seeking allies in the world of witches, then I can understand better. Stranger Things had its scary moments too but at least it had a very strong moral foundation. I felt compelled to watch the whole series but became more frustrated as it progressed. The political agenda was hamfisted, but this wasn't the worst part. I had enjoyed the original series and expected it to be teen-focussed and therefore somewhat cringeworthy, but the 'love story' between Sabrina and Harvey was tedious and took too much of the storyline. I also felt the show could have gone darker, but instead it just dipped a toe into the pool then retreated, although I suppose they must be careful when dealing with a 16 year old's issues. There is a lack of magic in more ways than one.
Some of the themes were predictable, e.g. men are either weak or sexist and ignorant, there was a missed opportunity to develop more rounded mature characters.
Miranda Otto and Michelle Gomez steal the show but unfortunately the actress who played Sabrina was flat and lacked charisma. This actually became the main irritant for me as not only were her acting skills poor in this role, the character of Sabrina was very annoying, shouty, bossy and unappealing.
As mentioned in other reviews, the inference that all witches worship Satan is misleading, which I found puzzling, as apparently many of the production team are pagans who presumably should know better. Credit where it's due, the first 2 episodes were pretty decent but soon after, things take a turn for the worse. It was a struggle to sit through some of the episodes as there simply isn't a lot happening and it feels very repetitive after a while. The cast is very earnest but even they look bored after a while. This show truly makes you appreciate the effort that goes into a show like RIVERDALE (I hear it has the same executive producers). Hope they cancel it after season 1 and revive Ironfist instead. I finished the series and there were some kinda enjoyable or fun things about it, but the entire series was so agenda driven it's a joke. Not only that, but it's okay for Sabrina to whatever she wants and thinks is right but not okay for other people to do it her hypocrisy and superiority complex was infuriating and make her almost unlikable - the rules of magic and consequences just don't apply to her, even when she screws up royally she doesn't have to face the consequence of it or think that what she did was wrong, everyone else suffers for it and cleans it up but not her - and it's okay to be prejudice so long as you think that the people are bad, but they aren't allowed to think you are wrong. I didn't mind the dark theme and the acting was good which is why it didn't get just 1 star, but the teenage angst and the unending propaganda and blatant hypocrisy was a huge deterrent and turn off. None of the characters were really fun or likable except for Ambrose, he was really the only fun and dynamic character in the whole show, everyone else was just so one dimensional. First, I must say that this show is not for children...there are graphic and gory scenes and some chilling phobic scenarios, which of course are enjoyable if you're prepared for that.<br/><br/>I actually like the overall dark tone and slow-progressing storyline, and Shipka (Sabrina) plays the role very well.
Here are the issues with the show...the camera work and blurry scenes are just annoying. They don't add anything, and honestly, by episode 5, they seem to start moving away from the blurry shots a bit, but I'd like to see them gone altogether.
The characters...there aren't many likable ones. Sabrina (Shipka) is likeable and so is her cousin Ambrose (Perdomo), but that's about it. The aunts, for whatever reason, are somewhat forced, awkward at times, aloof, and sometimes just generally unlikeable. And Harvey is just so bland, I wouldn't even notice if he was missing from a few episodes... Hopefully they develop more as the show moves along.<br/><br/>The last thing that really bothers me is more of a personal preference, I'm sure...
One of my issues is that Salem is practically missing. This is supposed to be her familiar, her sidekick, her support...
And, at first I understood why the cat, Salem, didn't talk to fulfill a more serious and dark tone, but seeing as how the show has evolved to include somewhat cheesy characters (demons, goblins) and storylines like one might have seen in Charmed, I'm not quite sure why they didn't just include it, other than the fact that Shipka is allergic to cats and Salem's part has been almost entirely eliminated. But, seeing as how Salem was almost a dog, I guess we're lucky to have the few black cat shots we get! I really liked the idea, but Sabrina annoys me with her "why can't I" superiority and I need to put my boyfriend above everything, including family. Maybe it's because she's a teenager but I don't know... Not really a fan... Other characters are okay I suppose I love love the old Sabrina so maybe I'm biased but I'm not feeling the devil worshiping. I'm super disappointed in how unlikable they made her Aunts, especially Zelda. Her whole family unit seems untrustworthy. I do like how they touch on some of the issues they face at the school with the bullies and the principle. I'm all for feminists and black lives matter. Just wish her family was more likable, also the blurry scenes are annoying. I was excited for this show and I will say that the production value is very good, the cinematography is usually pretty good and the acting for the most part is all right. But I really had a hard time getting through the first episode. The characters give all the exposition through dialogue and it just comes across as very boring when the audience is simply being told what is happening. If the show used its visuals more (which it really doesn't, all the cool or spooky looking places are just backgrounds that the characters talk in front of) then I would give a 6/10.<br/><br/>The characters aren't all that compelling, they try to be emotional but the writing is usually just too clunky that it sounds like they're just reading off the script. I don't really blame all the actors since it can be hard to make bad writing sound good. I do find it a little weird that the actress who plays Sabrina looks a lot younger than the actor who plays Harvey, to me she looks like she is maybe a freshman in high school and he looks like he could be in his 20s.<br/><br/>There is also a strange blur effect that is put over some shots, but this effect isn't used with any focus or purpose. In one scene the effect is used on some shots but not on others. I thought it was being used when there was some dark force or magic but it's not; it's just used at random with no real reason, and it does not look very good anyway.<br/><br/>This show could have been very interesting but it makes no use of its setting (which is way more cool-looking and cinematic than the settings of the sitcom) and the dialogue gives away all the exposition, no plot information is shown to us we just get told what happens in the show. It's very boring and the writing has no subtlety at all. For those of you considering watching this garbage, I'll save you some time by giving you the following quick seven-word summation of the entire show:<br/><br/>Straight white men - bad; all others - good.<br/><br/>There, I've just saved you from wasting ten hours of your life. You're welcome. A show with great potential completely poisoned by political correctness, better stick to the comic I was really interested in this show. I liked the original sitcom and I knew they were going in a darker less kid friendly direction with this installment which is perfect for this time of year. I watched the pilot to see what would be in store for me. I'm sorry to say that while the story and atmosphere are engaging, Netflix has once again decided to inject social commentary into another of their shows. Not 30 minutes into episode one we have a black character mentioning how she tried to get a Black Panther club started at their high school and that the "white patriarchy" needed to be taken down. These are the words to best describe this show. As a magical show goes, it works. It shows the original way witches are meant to work. However, what I do not appreciate as someone who is apart of Wicca(n) and is a psychic by nature (no not the type to garner attention), I do not appreciate that the writers have portrayed all witches to want to get with Lucifer and are evil by nature. Eating one another if they are hungry, or that they have to submit if Lucifer returns. As far as any other show with magic in it, this was never the case.<br/><br/>Harry Potter, Original Sabrina the Teenage witch, Supernatural, Constantine, The Magicians, and a lot more notable people and series, have never portrayed magic as evil, more so that it's a tool, as science helps us to understand, magic helps us in many other ways. As 1 person on the internet said "Magic is nothing more than science with different tools" which is fair to say when you're making a magic potion.<br/><br/>When you think about it, making break with wheat, milk, eggs, and more, than turning the dough into bread. That's basically just alchemy.<br/><br/>As the show goes on, they go into more detailed about Sabrina attending a mortal school and a magic school. Basically it's "Sabrina and ______" basically it's Harry Potter gone bad. As a show about magic goes, this is alright. It's well written magic wise but the portrayal goes about itself is what will ultimately cause it's downfall. From teenage issues, to a "non-gender-non-sexual-non-binary," to some black girl losing her vision at some point and a boy that Sabrina is dating who wont shut up long enough to let her speak. This show is riddled with questions and problems that doesn't seem to resolve itself.<br/><br/>The only key-note in this entire series is that the football players get dealt with. Aside from that, it's mostly everyone going on about Sabrina joining a satanic cult and if she doesn't they will literally kill her.<br/><br/>Also, these 3 (b)itches hate her cause she's a mugblood and torment her ass till they finally get their asses (well necks) handed to them finally and leave them alone. I was looking forward to a darker, edgier version of Sabrina, a compete retelling of the story, but this had fewer thrills and chills than Mr Toad's Wild Ride. Starting out, the comic book opening credits set the wrong tone, the music was more suitable to the original show, and the blurred scenes were entirely overdone. It seemed to find its legs after the fourth episode, but no, it couldn't be sustained. Finally, Michelle Gomez is wonderful to watch, but Bronson Pinchot's talents are completely wasted. The rest of the cast is more than adequate but no standouts for which I blame the writers et al.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the "Charmed" reboot, which I thought was going to be a bust, is quite watchable. so there's that bit of good news. I gave it a two because the Cat was cute and the house was cool. This show is trying way to hard. Writers / Producers have made sure to be inclusive of every minority and every modern day representation. Ethnics - check, Bullies - check, LGBTQ - check, ME TOO - check. All in the first episode!!! None of characters are likable. Sabrina is a morally inconsistent mess and dull! The aunts are both terrible for their own reasons. I didn't care about the romance as we have not seen any foundation of it. I wanted to give this show a chance, I really did. I think a Dark Sabrina would be cool but this was utter garbage. And yeah did I mention the new cousin Ambrose, yeah he's just filling in for Salem now (giving advice, perching up on rails and benches etc) because Salem doesn't talk.
Which totally would have worked if they had just made it Sabrina was the only one who could communicate with him. Big missed opportunity. Don't waste your time I think I would have liked this as I love the idea of a dark twist, however, I can't stand the girl who plays Sabrina. I find her irritating and distracting. I don't see her as Sabrina, but the actress playing her. On top of that, some of the selfish and irresponsible stuff she does is ridiculous. She never listens and just assumes she knows better than everyone else. The first episode or two hooked me, but then it went off on a super random tangent. So many plot holes that I just don't understand the need for! Super interesting leads that go nowhere, really boring and stupid plot lines that go somewhere-Sabrina was all over the damn map. Super disappointing. Only reason Im giving 4 stars is for the special effects makeup, the acting & the stylizing of the wardrobes. Ugh. i didnt like this show. I gave it a 3 star because the set design was a 10/10. Everything felt forced in this show. What was this show even about? Its like nothing can just happen in TV shows anymore. Its like everything has to be so obvious or overly explained. Nothing can be left for open interpretation. Also, the over usage of "hail satan" or "praise satan" became cringey and overwhelming. It was like "GET TO THE POINT ALREADY". There are a lot of great movies and shows that use satanic material, but its done is a less obvious and subtle way which actually adds to the overall tone. This show however, over salted the chicken! Good gracious! We get it you worship the devil. We get it you're diverse and misunderstood. It felt like a a fan fic that someone found in the trash and was like "lets not change the dialogue in this at all". Chilling Adventures of Sabrina is a supernatural teen drama that focuses heavily on the supernatural and doesn't really care much about the teen drama. I thought the performances were generally pretty good, Shipka actually comes across very strongly, especially in the early episodes, to the point of over-acting. She plays her character just a touch too loud, and too aware that she's the spotlight of every scene. I think it evens out over the ten episodes though. The adult witches are all veteran actors and actresses though and really elevate the material.<br/><br/>The set designs are amazing, and so is, I think, the editing. I was really impressed by the feel of this show, it was slick without being obvious about it, scenes had energy, even if the accompanying storylines didn't. All the intangibles worked well for this show and made it feel enjoyable to watch. Very cinematic, very nicely shot.<br/><br/>The episodes themselves often didn't feel boring right away, but you'd get halfway in and something just started feeling boring or bloodless about them. I didn't really care most of the time that deeply, I wanted to keep watching, but there was an element of mild boredom, with episodes running together because so many events were unimportant. The dialogue was okay, the story, when you think about it in summation, sounds fine, but something about it all just felt off, slow, meandering, and not at all emotionally engaging.<br/><br/>There is the issue of how "woke" the show is. It's a poorly kept secret that Hollywood writers usually do an absolutely terrible job writing characters and plotlines that they've purposely shoe-horned in for virtue points. Which is strange, they put them in there, they wanted to write these characters and storylines! Unfortunately Sabrina's non-witch friends aren't given much personality or voice. They're boring. Their stories are boring, their lives aren't engaging for the audience. Her black friend is maybe a little sassy (surprise!) and then gets some lesser superpowers too. Partly, I suspect, because GRRL POWER, and partly just because she has no real life of her own and doesn't feature very prominently in Sabrina's either.<br/><br/>Her gender non-binary friend is about the same, she gets a ghost sidekick, but is uninteresting and pointless. And more obviously used to create some oppression porn moments which ring false and are kind of embarrassing for the show. She gets beat up by football players, and I'm sure all manner of abuses have been heaped on teenagers by other teenagers over the course of human history in individual cases, but as an American watching a show also set in America, boy that's just wishful thinking by a far-leftist. Whatever time this show wants to pretend to be set in, it's never been appropriate for a teenage boy to beat up a teenage girl, AT ALL. The "white patriarchy" as this show would call adult males react rather poorly to that kind of behavior and always have. If you were a 6'1" football player who gave a beating to a tiny little girl because she isn't sure what gender she is, other male students would step in the give you a lesson at just about every high school in the 1950s, and that's before the middle aged white men got their hands on you. But, of course, the bullies for the gender non-binary girl have to be the most oppressive Americana-esque thing the writer can fantasize of, so it's white, male football players. And not the far more realistic bunches and bunches of other girls. Because then where would your girl power be?<br/><br/>I actually made sure to double-check online what this character's issue was supposed to be, they do so poor of a job outlining it on the show, because in reality she's just presented as a slightly tomboyish girl who is very small and very slight. I hate to break it to anybody, but in mid-century America nobody in high school would give a **** that you declared yourself a gender non-binary person and then beat you up. People wouldn't even notice, and if you told them they would just look at you funny and move on with their life. Unless they were a mean girl out to pick on you. That's the reality though, which isn't always what our social agit-prop prefers to show. Though what's the point of trying to make a point if you're making it about a fantasy world?<br/><br/>Yet the show's writers insisted on shoe-horning this stuff in because it's popular with coastal liberals living in their bubbles. It wouldn't bother me save that it's so forced and fake, and that the writers themselves treat these characters and their stories like a chore; neither girl is interesting or worthwhile, no one put any time into giving them a personality or an inner life. And of course their "woke" plots are covered in passing because they really just don't care.<br/><br/>And in that same vein Harvey's father is a bit of a one note, stereotypically evil man. It's like the showrunner wanted to take out their anger about Trump all on this singular character. He's evil without reason, and treated by the show as if he's not abnormally psychopathic, because of course they're forwarding that this is just the normal middle aged white man. It's really a bit desperate, to be honest. And again isn't attached to reality.<br/><br/>In the end I think the show is beautiful, too much CGI blurring notwithstanding, and the people responsible for the set design and the editing have a lot to be proud of, their work is superlative. But also it's unengaging and the writing is very average. It's not a surprise that it's from the makers of Riverdale, the plots come across like they were made by very experienced soap opera writers, but it never rises above that melodramatic feeling. And the darker turns later in the season just don't stick the landing tonally, something which was a problem for Riverdale and say Friday Night Lights, another teen drama. When the show comes back I probably won't bother watching the second season, there's better television out there, not to mention seasons two and three of Buffy the Vampire Slayer which remain far superior versions of the exact same thing. Some things are just not needed, there's too much going on. The 3 girls in the school are just over the top and pointless. I feel it's trying too hard. Zelda is just a bit meh I don't get her character at the moment. It would have been nice to have Sabrina and Harvey's relationship grow rather than be at its peak at the beginning. That Scottish bird from green wing I don't know what she's doing either, one minute she helps her then the next she doesn't?! I still need to finish it. It's just so busy but at the same time slow if that make sense. I really liked Riverdale and expected something similar as the show is made by the same people but it does not even remotely compare to Riverdale. Even Riverdale seemed scarier and more mystical. These series are very childish, the characters and story line are not convincing at all.
The show had such a great potential but failed to impress. Struggling to watch due to the nausea inducing cinematography. Filming concentrates on the center of the screen and the background is blurred. This cause and awful headache inducing nausea and it looks like I am not the only one. In the day of HD and 4K this is pretty much unacceptable. Borring and doesn't leave anything Good for your Life. Felt terrible about eat Hong it. A complete waste of time To the people who are saying "Well its based off the graphic novel." Then that was a stupid idea by Netflix, because 95% of the people who are coming to watch this haven't read the graphic novel, we've watched the original TV show and we're going to compare it to that.
I honestly didn't mind the darker tone, I expected it and was excited for it, but NONE of the characters have any similarities to their original versions. Harvey didn't have to be played for comedy, but was it too much to ask for him to accept Sabrina as herself because he loves her despite being a witch? So Salem is now a demon? ...okay but why did you have to make him COMPLETELY mute? There's a nonbinary character and a black panther as Sabrina's friends and she's starting a feminist club because the nonbinary one was bullied and the principal was a dick? Kinda shoving your message down our throats at this point.
Why didn't you just have Libby come back as queen B**ch of the school and make their lives a living hell? The anti patriarchy angle makes no sense whatsoever when your main character is looking forward to making herself the servant of the devil.
The original show had its "men are dumb and women are better" plot points, but they were done with some subtlety and tact that made it entertaining to watch because on top of that, Sabrina had to deal with her inability to use magic.
This Sabrina has the personality of a piece of wood as well as the emotional range of one.She doesn't act like a teenager at all and I don't see how anyone can identify with her or any of the other characters. I keep seeing this show get praised for its checking off the list of representation, but I find it insulting. Wouldn't you rather be represented by a character you can ACTUALLY identify with than one that's just stuck on the screen to appease you? I'm not a warlock stuck in the body of a cat for attempting to take over the world, but I adored Salem in the original show. I'm not a teenage witch struggling to balance her life in highschool with having to learn her powers, but I identified with Sabrina with trying to juggle my priorities to friends, family and schoolwork as well as a job at 16.
I'm hoping that soon people will look deeper than the color of someones skin and whatever they identify as so we can get some quality shows with better writing. Otherwise we're just going to keep getting the bland souless shows like this one with a name slapped on it to get people to turn it on. 1) They've gone and built the set around 50's and they destroy it with one iPhone, one pair of headphones and one laptop. It's ridiculous!<br/><br/>2) I like the dark theme but it was kind of empty. They could have gone with a "Dark Shadows" approach and insert some vibrant colors. Just like they did with her red coat.<br/><br/>3) There's a lacklustre absence of visual or audio effects for when magic was used<br/><br/>4) They pushed too much towards the thriller genre and it was a few times uncomfortable.<br/><br/>5) The magic school grounds were very much unexplored. Plus the building it was based on was very unimaginative.<br/><br/>6) I loved the African cousin Ambrose but I'd love him even more if they gave us some background as to how he is related to a family as white as milk.<br/><br/>The only thing that's saving this show is the good acting from most of the cast. Wow. I grew up with the original Sabrina, and enjoyed every second of it. I also read up on the occult and Satanism. And I even support empowerment of women. However, this show wants to be a mouthpiece for young girls and strong women, and all on the expense of men and all of society in general. Representation is great, but forcing your wishes and morals on people is hard to watch. Especially when it's this obvious and blatant.<br/><br/>First episode has a genderless person being harassed for being a boy/girl -no one realky knows - and Sabrina, instead of using her magic to help, goes around school blamung everyone and wants to start a emancipation club. This isn't even bad. However, 16-yo kids talking in grown up language as if they'd attended or even finished college sounds really forced. Everyone's smart and into evil things, but regular people are dumb and the Devil. Oh yeah, and Harvey Kinkle is all of a sudden a cuckholded boy who indulges Sabrina's every fantasy as well as a football player. Way to emasculate him.<br/><br/>I was hoping this show'd be a mix between brilliant comedy and a pinch of the occult. Alas, it's more of a wishful feminist idea on how to blame the patriarchy for all their problems and never say women have been complacent all this time. Also, Sabrina looks strangely like an adolescent boy with makeup and blonde hair. Like someone who went through gender transition and tries hard to be what they imagine to be a girl. Hoped for sly feminist ideas, got hardcore PC assault. No thnx.<br/><br/>The only positive is the overall tone and production value of the show. Looks and feels amazing when the extreme feminists aren't talking. That deserves 5/10. The political agenda used in this show resembles a huge mace that hits you few times an episode in head.<br/><br/>I know I can't expect much from garbage fodder Netflix relases, but damn, they sure overdid themselves with this one. Nothing worth mention except actress look like Emma Watson. If you're an atheist then you just may enjoy this series while having thoughts of Christians such as myself, being completely turned off by this show.<br/><br/>Now don't get it twisted. I believe in Jesus Christ, heaven and hell. That doesn't mean I am opposed to violence in motion pictures. After all, there is real violence in our world. I love the show Supernatural even though I dislike some of the shows portrayal of God and his angels. And after 3 failed attempts over a 2-year period, I finally got into Game of Thrones and now rate it as being in my top 10 of all time even though I'm not a fan of the extreme violently brutal killing scenes that fill the series.<br/><br/>Having said all that, late last night, I somehow made it up to episode 6 of Sabrina. Why I turned it off, never to watch again, wasn't even about the witches, black magic and casting spells. No, what got me to wake up and shut it down was the fact that the entire show, in each of the 5 √Ç¬Ω episodes I watched, speak of satan just as a show like Touched by an Angel or some other religious themed series would talk about God. They give thanks to satan around every corner. They go on and on about their satanic bible, their dark church, etc., just about every 5 to 10 minutes. Really, it was like watching a show or film about a very strict catholic family, trying to force the young teen daughter to honor her family's wishes for her to be a good catholic in complete worship to God. Only in Sabrina, it's all about literally worshipping satan, giving your soul to him and living your life for his will.<br/><br/>In one of the episodes, they talk about the garden of eden and how God is the deceiver and that Eve eating from the tree is a good thing which opened her eyes to the lies of God and to the righteousness of satan and his desire to give everyone so-called freedom and power.<br/><br/>Again, if you have any belief in Christ, this show is not for you. It's not just entertainment. It is seriously built on a foundation of satan worshipping, that which can been seen and heard in every other scene.<br/><br/>The acting is good, as is the dialogue and cinematography. The problem, as mentioned above, leads up to an overwhelming feeling that this horror show (this isn't for small kids) is truly glorifying satan worshipping like nothing I have ever watched and hopefully like nothing I will ever watch again. Ok so Salem does not speak like he use to... I know it's silly but I think that's what this show needed. There no commic relef, their trying to make teenage and self caused dramas dramatic and serious. I can't get behind a main character that is just fixing their own problems. If she had an enemy to fight consistently over time I would be more behind the show. But this just seems like something I watched in primary school. Girl has problem, girl resolves, girl learns a lesson. And that cycle repeats ever episode. The ending also forces a second season with one scene which was unnecessary. The actual final scene it self was a classic end scene where you can take or leave another season there our no left over questions. The scene I'm referring to was just put in so they can make another season. This had potential, but as usual fails miserably because of identity politics. Social Justice galore... I can't keep watching this crap. As some have pointed out the over political tones for the feminism and trans movements which you can over look for some time. But then we also have so many plot holes through out that just make the series feel stupid and shows the writers didn't plan it out in the long run. I understand why this has so many good reviews. People (including me) really love this genre, and they'll watch it even when it's poorly done. After all, horror is in, supernatural is ultra cool, and Sabrina's eyebrows are on fleek.
But there's no substance to this series. It's like the writers decided to take every horror cliche, mash it all up with every politically correct cliche and then serve it with a blood moon on top.
The warmed-over plot-lines in this series might still be palatable if there were some great actors giving it their all. But the simple truth is that Kiernan Shipka just can't act. Her dialog delivery and timing is painful to watch. She has the same expression for every single emotion....those eyebrows cocked at the same for what? Worry? Fear? Disappointment? Joy? Happiness? Horror? It's almost impossible to tell. Her speech inflection is just downright disconcerting. I never knew whether she was complimenting someone or telling them to go to you know where. There is never any difference in her tone. Physically, her face is like a mask: mouth never moves...just tongue and teeth, creating a deadpan look so lacking in expression and so distracting that after a while, I found I couldn't care less about whether she signed the bloody book or not.
Her supporting cast does their best, but there is zero chemistry between Shipka and, well, anyone else in the show. That's glaring in particular with Harvey, the mortal boyfriend. One ends up just really not caring what happens to that romance.
Go ahead, Sabrina! Sign the book! The Dark Lord has GOT to be a step up from Harvey Milquetoast. Really, the best actor in the show is Sabrina's familiar Salem the cat. And he doesn't have any speaking lines.
This show tries to bite off way more than it can chew and ends up choking on it. Riverdale, it is not. For a series based on the more recent comicbook and most def NOT the old tv spin-off from Bewitched, there isn't even any true comic relief built in. It takes itself far too seriously and would be so much better if it would lighten up.... and also recast the lead.
Love the supernatural/horror genre? Do yourself a favor and binge Haunting of Hill House instead. It is just another lame attempt to push far left hate group propaganda onto the teens and tweens. Fun show, stylish and slick except for the inaccuracies of technological note such as cellular phones, etc. If you go by the cars, fashions and the like, it appears to be the 1960's. I would have given a much better rating if not for that. I watched a couple episodes until it became clear that this '15' year old girl was being overly sexualized with near-nude scenes and lots of sexual innuendo. Yes, the actress is over 18 (and looks to be nearing 30), but she plays the role of a 15 year old. The sexualization has very little to do with the storyline and, so, is unnecessary. I can only imagine how many creepy old guys will watch this simply because she is '15'.
Well, this is one creepy old guy who will stick to fantasizing about adults, thank you. I was really excited to see what the Sabrina reboot was going to be like as I had never heard of it before turning on Netflix today. I loved the old show back in the day (especially Salem) but this one feels more like a platform for writers to vent about exaggerated political issues. This so called remake is a terrible movie. It is nothing close to the a regional beloved TV show and shouldn't even be called a remake. Producers a just ruining good shows. Will not watch. Like many shows made in this era this show is overly political. People watch shows to escape the toxic political climate, not to be reminded of it.<br/><br/>20 minutes in and they're creating a club to combat "toxic masculinity".<br/><br/>This show won't age well.<br/><br/>Tried my hardest to like it but this is just too much. I love occult shows and movies. I love supernatural stories.<br/><br/>However, this has got too many political nuances and references to be true escapism. It also blatantly talks about worshipping Satan and serving Satan. Regardless of my religious beliefs I feel wholly uncomfortable inviting bad juju like that into my home.<br/><br/>I'd rather step away from this one. I was happy to watch new Sabrina with littel bit serious magic. Cast choice is not good they look old and they dont look like high school student at all. New Harvey looks like drug addict and almost 30 years old (i know he is 22 but he looks very old with those greasy hair) Sabrina's skin is not good they made so much job to close her face. Also her eyebrows take your all attantion. Most importantly they used " Lens operation effect " too much.Every seen backround disappear, very very flu. You dont even see the trees in the forest. Looks like green mud. I couldnt watch because i felt like drunk and just closed. Tecnically they made huge mistake i couldnt even watch all the episodes it gave me nausia. Also please use young actors or make it in the university or something. Please NO , Last thing i want is another feminst " woman have to rule the world "sentence out of a woman her mouth . Watching first episode and already hearing this this made me cringe . This serie is gonna be on my never watch again list I really liked the story, the filmmaking and the executing of the series so far, but what really put me off was the lead actress, the whole series I felt like she is imposting Emma Watson in Harry Potter, I didn't feel that she showed herself as a lead actress, I am not saying she is a bad actress, I would like to see her in future roles and I hope that she would free herself from any kind of pressure. Does every show now a days have to stand for something. Can a show just come out and be a good show. The show has alot of potential with it being darker then the original, but every episode that I actually watched was I'm a feminist this I'm a feminist this. Can the show just be about witches and stuff of that nature. I have no problems with message fiction. George Orwell's 1984 is the finest piece of fiction that unapologetically pushes a moral the writer wanted to tell. And I would go as far as saying that message storytelling is the hardest plot a writer can ever attempt. Great care is needed when constructing the message to be carried by a story. In Orwell's novel, he was careful with how he expressed his message and he inter-weaved it naturally to the narrative of the book. Its message is so ingrained to the plot of 1984 that you couldn't remove the anti-authoritarian themes from it and expect a comprehensible story. Furthermore, Orwell couldn't add approval of a competing form of authoritarianism to his plot without being insincere and hypocritical with the message he is trying to express.<br/><br/>The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina is what happens when a writer with less skill develops characters and plots long before he/she develops a message to go with them. It would appear that modern writers are affected by this problem more so than writers of the past, especially television and film writers. I speculate that this is as a result of new writers coming straight out of colleges and their Eng Lit professors gave them this appalling advice: If they have a message then it should be expressed directly from the mouths and thoughts of their characters. Weaving your message and themes into the plot with even the slightest measure of skill is too "pretentious" for the modern writer or the reader\consumer to digest. Who knows? Whatever the case may be for the writers of this show, it's hard to ignore that the message presented here is clumsy and episodic when it is expressed.<br/><br/>So I shall do my best to point out why it's awkward and disjointed by retelling and criticizing the relevant threads throughout this season:<br/><br/>Susie (an androgynous trans friend of the titular character) tells Sabrina that he had his shirt pulled up by four boys of the football team. The boys did this to verify his gender. Sabrina is naturally upset and goes to the principal on his behalf to file a complaint, but the principal patronizingly brushes it off and questions the truth of it. He even suggests to her that Sabrina's friend should enroll in another school as Greendale High "isn't the right fit for him." Sounds very plausible, right? In my own high school days if a group of boys sexually assaulted a girl, even if that girl was a trans boy, the principal wouldn't have brushed off the accusation or the behavior of the boys without further investigation. Nor would he have suggested that the girl was over-reacting.<br/><br/>This scenario stretches my suspension of disbelief considerably and that is an astounding achievement in a world filled with witches, goblins, ghosts, and demons. I've no point of reference to draw from for the supernatural elements of the plot, so I can "believe" in all that within the rules given to me by the plot. The real stuff is where it beggars belief. Outside of extraordinary circumstances, golden boys or not, the principal would've lost his job (as he should) if he pulled this kind of crap.<br/><br/>So after the claims are dismissed by the principal, and with the aid of her boyfriend Harvey, and her two friends, Susie and Roz, (another friend of Sabrina's) Sabrina decides to create a school group called "Women's Intersectional Creative Cultural Association" or WICCA. The aforementioned cartoon-character-for-a-principal objects to this group's formation for some silly reason, other than to act out as an obstacle in our hero's path at this point in the story. This club is "A club for young women to meet and bolster each other", in Sabrina's own words.<br/><br/>Oh, what do you know? An inexperienced writer expressing their morals directly from the mouths of his characters instead of weaving skillfully them into the plot. My headache still persists from the bludgeoning I received here.<br/><br/>While that real-world drama involving her friends is taking place, Sabrina also faces another dilemma concerning her secret life. It's approaching the date of her sixteenth birthday and she needs to make a choice before then: A future with her friends in the real world or a future as a witch. Her two adoptive aunts have her set on making the latter choice and she has not expressed to either aunt the conflict she feels when she facing this fork in the road. To add to the drama, she hasn't told her boyfriend or her friends that she will be whisked away to a "private school" if she should choose a life as a witch.<br/><br/>Unfortunately and predictably, this is where it trips over the awkward message it was pushing earlier.<br/><br/>At the eleventh hour, she decides to tell her boyfriend Harvey that she will be leaving for a private school. A half-lie. As you would expect he's a bit upset with her and presses for more information. She relents and tells him what she is. This revelation causes further drama and he's freaked out about it. When he tries to leave her for a bit of a think, she catches up to him and casts a memory spell on him to make him forget and returns him to blissful ignorance.<br/><br/>Now, if it wasn't for the message it was pushing I would've reacted to this twist as the natural start of Sabrina's character arc: She casts a spell for her own selfish desires, without considering the consequences of it. As her arc progresses, she is more reckless and selfish in her spell casting, and by the end, the consequences come back to bite her on the ass. This forces her to come out of her arc as a changed woman, both externally and internally; for better or worse. In fact, it is her arc throughout the season or close to it. However, the previous clumsy and superfluous "girl power" message outside of this start to her arc irritated me.<br/><br/>A thought crossed my mind after she did this to Harvey: If men drugging women for their own selfish and sexual desires are (rightfully) condemned by Feminists, then how could it be okay for a woman to do the same thing to a man? Especially a Feminist woman? It's more contemptible due to the hypocrisy.<br/><br/>As mentioned, this thought wouldn't have been on my mind, but the writer was so careless and hypocritical with the message he/she was attempting to tell the viewer that I couldn't remove it from my thoughts. It's also very episodic storytelling (the kind Aristotle hated, not the television kind) as I shall explain.<br/><br/>The club is mentioned later, but never becomes anything more than a throwaway from a previous story. The principal is still a real-life cartoon character in future episodes, who should have remained a simple background character. Susie has a few more irritating run-ins with the boys, but these encounters have no impact on the grander plot. There is a spell Sabrina and a few other witches cast on these boys in the third episode, but even that is unnecessary because Sabrina is given plenty more opportunities throughout the season to f**k things up with her irresponsible spell use.<br/><br/>With some careful editing, you could remove the message stuff and these threads, and the rest of this season's plot wouldn't suffer for it. It's not even relevant to Susie's arc throughout the remainder of the season. He would still be the same one dimensional (and insultingly token) character if the ham-fisted message and threads related to him were removed in their entirety.<br/><br/>Still, it's not all bad news. Despite the episodic and clumsy storytelling here and there, I enjoyed this first season. If you look beyond the awkward attempts at sending a message in the early episodes and the odd hint in a later episode, you'll find an enjoyably trashy bit of supernatural soap opera television.<br/><br/>I just wish it wasn't so hard for me to look beyond the bad here when the bad could've been avoided. Went into this series with no expectations and was hoping to be surprisingly impressed... it's yet to happen. The young characters have very typical PC millennial views that are shoved at you at every opportunity which after a while become very annoying and not particularly relevant to anything, they feel like they're put it to tick a "we've covered mordern issues box". The story doesn't flow naturally and everything is overly explained by the characters making everything seem panto esc (he's behind you!) meaning all gore and scare scenes fall flat, I mean I'm a horror whimp and I didn't bring my pillow even close to my face once. This series could have been clever, dark and a Morden twist on characters we all know and love, yet it resides to a on in the back ground/putting it on when there's nothing else to watch type show. When I decided to watch The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, I had no expectations at all. Being a fan of witch history and demonology, I was happy to see it had a part in the series. Then, disappointment came along.<br/><br/>While the political agenda is a turn off, I decided to ignore it and keep on watching. I was thrilled with the parts about Sabrina's witch half (or at least I was in the beginning), but I felt bored as soon as her human friends showed up.<br/><br/>The only "mortal" worth watching was Harvey and I did enjoy the cute teen romance. Sadly, the whole season took a big focus on the other mortals, even granting some of them "powers", which took away what made witches so special.<br/><br/>The blurry scenes were unnecessary and annoying. The dark themes were barely touched. Overall, disappointing. Firstly, If you're going to watch this because you liked the TV show in the 90's/early 00's then chances are you will not like this.<br/><br/>The Sabrina in this series is a snooty, stuck-up cow that likes to contradict almost all of the things she says and does. Somehow she knows the answer to every question/problem and even when shes faced with horrific situations she is never scared for more than 2 seconds before she tries to devalue the person/thing she is scared off by telling them that their religion and/or beliefs are wrong and invalid.
In the words of my girlfriend Sabrina is the biggest Mary Sue in the world.<br/><br/>You are meant to feel sorry for her friends, Suzie and Roz but you cannot because everything they do is done in an almost militant way but its almost like we're being forced to feel sorry for them even though they are in the wrong.
Getting bullied? Tackle the bully and try and knock the hell out of them.<br/><br/>Harvey, the boyfriend, is completely irreverent and brings nothing to the story.<br/><br/>The cinematography in the first two episodes is questionable with around 1/3 of both episodes filmed with a horrible blur effect.
I have read reviews and articles online saying how scary this is and I have even seen links to videos labeled "Tips from the cast to cope with how scary 'Sabrina' is". Utter tripe.
The Adventures of Sabrina is not scary but it is unnerving in the sense that this feels like its a docudrama about a Satanic cult. Satan is mentioned in every other scene and is either being worshiped or having someone possessed or sacrificed. F.Y.I I am not religious nor do I believe in these sort of things. My girlfriend is religious and it made her feel extremely uncomfortable to the point she wouldn't even be in the room when it was on.<br/><br/>All in all I wouldn't recommend you watch this and that you spend your time doing something more entertaining like staring at a wall in a dimly lit room.<br/><br/>P.s. If you are expecting a show about a witch to have more than 1 inconsequential spell per episode you should find a different show. I've enjoyed both seasons, but the second really got cooking about half way through. Very much looking forward to the next two seasons. I understand that a couple years ago they created a comic book version which was darker. However ENOUGH HOLLYWOOD with taking already existing TITLES & the characters names and instead of adding on to already great stories, you make something completely different!!! Stop piggy backing off the success of already existing shows! Enough with the dark stuff too. No wonder those lil girls in the states thought the devil was cool. its sick! I know theres always been satan stuff, and I love love witch craft. but what I've learned its theres a lot of good magic out there.<br/><br/>2 things that were positive was that yes they addressed transgenders & women empowerment. Personally I already thought Sabrina was this powerful female in the original show in the 90s!<br/><br/>I liked how they 1st addressed the transgenders. However I do not agree with violence fixing the problem. That was a teacher she did not agree with and although he was wrong. This show was saying its ok to fight against Authority. Riverdale already has teens completely going against authority and doing stuff no respectful parent would allow their kids to do. She could have handled it by goign to the school board or something like that. Teacher do listen to kids now. There are still some bad apples, however they are getting better. I got the whole boys will be boys when i was teased and went to a female teacher in the 90s. I get it! however Violence is not the solution!!<br/><br/>Now to break it down... Bad acting.. hated the setting. I love Vancouver but i knew every single spot they were at because its used right now in every show out there!!! Worse casting! I kept wanting to punch the main actress, sorry but you were annoying. I almost stopped watching half way but i suffered though the rest still hoping it would get better.<br/><br/>For the casting only thing they got right besides Sabrina being blonde... was that her aunts. 1 evil skinny(which was never evil only strict in the original) & 1 chubby nice one.. REALLY their weight was your concern.<br/><br/>I would 1000000% more rather they did a reboot of the original! they could have still included todays topics(trans/gays etc). Even if they had it where this was focused around Sabrina's daughter and dealing with some evil dark stuff.. BUT WITH THE ORIGINAL CAST!!<br/><br/>I mean how could you not make Salem talk!! And yes he was a sarcastic rude cat which made it funny! I would much rather binge the original right now because i bet i'd catch a bunch of adult jokes I never got back then. I heard 1 rumor its because the girl they cast was allergic to cats. I am sorry but I know tons of ppl who are and they can still be near my cats, even pet them. They just have to wash their hands. Some ppl have even stayed with me 3 days and lived.<br/><br/>Someone said this was chilling and clever.. What was chilling about it.. or clever... reminded me of so many other shows. 1 nothing was chilling about it, it was so basic. But it felt like they were trying to rip off supernatural.. Which is yes also filmed in Vancouver and filmed at every location This show went too!!! But they acting and story lines are 100000 x better in supernatural. It also felt like they were ripping all that failed spin off from Pretty little liars. Ravenswood? Teens & supernatural. It also had twilight vibes which was again FILMED AT THE SAME LOCATIONS.... btw i lived in Vancouver 6 years.. its not that gloomy and grey all the time. But all these shows try and give it that feel. Personally didnt buy it.<br/><br/>Oh last thing.. did they relaly have to repeat each others name 500 every time they talked. I noticed this alot when Harvey and Sabrina were talking. in a 1 min she mentioned his name usually 3-5 times. NO ONE DOES THAT!!! Let me start by saying I'm a Classical Liberal. You might ask "why are you making this review about politics", and the answer is: "Because that's exactly what this show does". I'm essentially forced to talk about this show through a political lens, because this show went out of its way to constantly, repeatedly, and unashamedly force the writers' dangerous, hypocritical political ideologies down our throats.<br/><br/>It does this to such an uninhibited degree, that the entire first episode is about Sabrina creating an all female club to support other women - because Sabrina's lesbian (or transgender male) friend was bullied and sexually assaulted by "white males". How convenient that the writers wrote the bullies as "white cis-gender males" and then used that creation to stereotype against "white males"; perpetuating the idea that "white males are entitled, violent, sexist, racist bullies". Because, you know, it's okay to generalize an entire population based on their sex/gender and skin color, as long as they're white people with XY chromosomes; even if it contradicts your other beliefs... but I digress.<br/><br/>Just think about this for a second. A dark, adult show, about magic. A show that should be right up my ally, that sounds absolutely badass and enchanting - and the entire first episode is a diatribe on LGBTQ rights, oppressed women, identity politics, and the white male patriarchy. They couldn't even hold off until the third episode; maybe hook a few of us on first, before they went full-on, all-encompassing "identity politics are easy, everyone believes in them right? You should too, and let's talk about it for an entire episode as we recruit you into our ideology or otherwise chastise you for disagreeing/being a white man". Give me a break. Bad first impression, and whoever green-lighted this, as well as the writers, should be fired. Pushing Neo-Marxist ideology is no different than pushing supremacist ideology. This isn't how you empower women, it's how you empower bad writers with small minds.<br/><br/>Even worse, are the reviews spewing the same narrow-minded, half-baked ideology that this show does (I guess they hit their target audience?): "White men are down-voting this because they can't handle it, because they're part of the oppressive patriarchy". Not only does this reinforce why someone might find this show unacceptable (since it's proof that this show is perpetuating dangerous stereotypes, and that it's viewers are inhabiting and bolstering them), but it's also proof that those who believe in identity politics can't manage to question or understand why half of us don't want to watch a fantasy magic show about SJW's. They think EVERYTHING is supposed to be about social justice and their worldview, and they can't see why we don't all want to watch shows about it. Imagine if every show was forced religious, conservative fundamentalism into as many scenes, lines, and contexts as they possibly could? How appetizing would anyone (especially you, SJWs) find that? Yet these writers, viewers, and reviewers can't draw that parallel? Utterly insane.<br/><br/>So to my point about being a Classical Liberal. Like many who share my values, I've come to realize that identity politics are incredibly dangerous. My values lie in treating others as individuals, regardless of their skin color or gender (it's not some radical idea). Identity politics represents the exact opposite of that. The fact that Hollywood, the media, and every Disney movie already force-feeds these ideologies to our communities is frightening enough. It's something that genuinely scares me. But Disney, for example, does it in a subtle enough way that it doesn't ruin any of their movies. In fact, I continue to find almost all of their movies absolutely wonderful, and don't mind choking down a few nods regarding social-constructionism and social-justice. I understand that they have the good intentions, and they understand that plot comes first. And that's the difference. What's happening in Sabrina is egregious and painful for any non-ideologue (regardless of your political affiliation).<br/><br/>Allow me to give you some summarized quotes and scenarios from the first episode of this show (very, very, very minor and ambiguous spoilers):<br/><br/><ul><li>White straight men are bullies, including men in "positions of power" (like the principle), and they actively go out of their way to push down, hold down, humiliate, and assault women and LGBTQs. White male principles don't take sexual assault seriously, and need to be viciously attacked and absent in order for a "club for women" to be established.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Sabrina creates an intersectional, female only club, and premises it on the fact that "the more women who join, the harder it will be for them (the men) to silence us". That pretty much sums up this show; nobody has ever told these writers that identity politics are dangerous and wrong, and so now a mainstream Netflix release, that should have been awesome, has been completely ruined - because social-constructionist feminists have created a "club so big" that nobody can silence them. And now they're writing awful scripts and destroying potentially awesome, high-budget shows since they can't be silenced. The irony isn't just tangible, it's suffocating.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>There's a scene about the apple of knowledge. Men call it the "apple of evil" and women call it "the apple of knowledge". The implication being, that men don't want women to have knowledge, because if women are knowledgeable, then they can't be oppressed and repressed by men; so to the men it's evil. But to the women, it means "breaking from male repression" so its knowledge.</li></ul><br/><br/>At a certain point you have to ask yourself: Are these genuine social issues? Is race and gender responsible for bad behavior (or just for white men; such a slippery slope)? And if true - to what extent? Or, perhaps, media like this, that constantly reaffirms such ideas, insists that they are real and omnipresent (both in the real world, and in a fantasy setting), creates fictional worlds absolutely riddled with such ideas, and then sells them to their audience - is painting this picture? Also, since when do privileged white women speak for the disenfranchised? It's a trope I'm seeing in real life as well, and it's absolutely painful seeing rich, pretty, protected, educated, white women play victim and speak as the captains of social justice. I'm so glad this rich, beautiful, powerful female celebrity, playing a smart, beautiful, powerful female witch, decided to surround herself with token minorities to push a social narrative.<br/><br/>Now, I know none of you have made it this far in my review, and I'm sorry. But for the love of god, I just wanted to watch a dark fantasy magic show, with a strong female lead. I'm incredibly disappointed in Netflix, and I genuinely hope that this show doesn't receive a second season. I'd much rather watch something like The OA which was written by an incredibly strong woman (Brit Marling), with a main character who is the complete characterization of female strength (as played by Brit Marling). An exceptional example of art that actually empowers women, rather than just "talking about it". It touches on many of the same issues, but cuts much deeper, without once shoving radical ideology down your throat.<br/><br/>Beyond that. I'll share a few non-political concerns. Namely: Every time "something magic is going on" the edges of the screen are blurred. Strange style choice, and it becomes distracting after a while. Also the actor who plays Sabrina: She is far too egotistical, and everything she says just comes off way too confident and rigid. Most of the supporting characters are one-dimensional and poorly written.<br/><br/>If you want to watch a dark Netflix original series, watch 'The Haunting of Hill House'. It's become the best (my favorite) series that I have ever seen, in my entire life... except for the last two episodes. Your mileage may vary. The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina is a much darker, not for children, version of Sabrina the Teen Aged Witch. It is filled with a variety of brilliant casting and awesome scenery, but falls short on being worth while.<br/><br/>The opening scene speaks of Sabrina is half witch and half mortal. However, this is a serious flaw in the story line. There is no such thing as a half witch/half mortal. Witches aren't a different species. They are humans who practice magic. They don't have different DNA. Witches are mortal also.<br/><br/>I watched the first fifteen minutes of the show and thought that it might have some potential. However they, the writers, really are in need of some ADD medication.<br/><br/>I found the script piecemeal in style. It was broken up and lacked in flow and continuity. It seemed like they were telling multiple stories at the same time.<br/><br/>Sabrina is supposed to be the main character but instead it seems to be about the evil forces and Sabrina is a secondary character.<br/><br/>The 1950's eerie music and sounds also mix up the story making it seem childish but the amount of bloodshed is more along the lines of Evil Dead.<br/><br/>There are some very serious fallacies in the episodes which I won't spoil for the viewer. The fallacies conflict on episode from another because the writers can't keep their story straight.<br/><br/>I found the entire show to be confusing and with missed opportunities. They really messed up. The show is too predictable. It is poorly written. I liked the casting though and the cinematography is good. Overall I found it boring with glimmers of tasty morsels.<br/><br/>(edit)
Just finished the 3rd season and I was disappointed. I kept watching because I thought that the writers would resolve the serious plot flaws.<br/><br/>I have tried writing stories. I'm OK with short stories which aren't complex, so I get how these mistakes happen. However, there are usually more than one writer on a show of this magnitude. You would think that a team of writers would not only discover these mistakes but they would correct them. Like to see supernatural but this was so horrible and grosse, just saw two episodes and don't want to see more ,it was so brash, I have watched werewolves and vampires and Witches serials, but this is bad . Plenty of potential but a bit boring. I find the 10/10 scores a bit much. This is one of the most boring shows.
It should never have been made as a remake.
1* poor acting
2*boring storyline
3*hardly any witchcraft
4* to dark.
If your have nothing to watch, it's just about worth the watch. But if your a fan of Sabrina the teenage witch. Don't bother with this. It's rubbish Sorry to the cast and crew for this negative review, but I call them as I see them. This was one of the most painful shows ever!<br/><br/>Casting was very off for a myriad of reasons!
1.) Why is everyone British? Don't Canadians or Americans count as horror actors any more?<br/><br/>2.) Sabrina has ZERO emotion and is more like one of those sullen and pathetic characters that we all loathe and never love. The character isn't dark and mysterious in a fun and spooky way -- she is like watching Debbie Downer on magic ...<br/><br/>3.) Can't the production company afford lighting and a cinemaphotographer? Remember Producers and Directors, TV is a visual medium and it is not meant to be listened to like a radio. Most of the shots were just black and barely a light shining through on the screen.<br/><br/>4.) Wardrobe! UGH What is up with the Little Red Riding Hood coat and bag? Really? That coat must really stink to high heaven after all those days of filming and wearing.<br/><br/>
5.) Hair - really? The wigs/styles of the actresses are dreadful -- if you wanted to make this a laughable comedy, you should have written a different script - but as it stands, it is a long-drawn out and pathetic attempt at mystery and drama with a complete fail. So why have circus clown hair styles.<br/><br/>6.) Texting instead of talking??? Why, because the actors can't deliver a quality line and writers/producers/directors have no confidence in the actors they cast to get a point across??? And remember, blind people listening to the show can't read the vapid text messages the characters are sharing .. What a LOSER move on the end of the writers. Shame on you!<br/><br/>
7.) Too many clich√É¬© and stereotype lines, moments and stolen story lines from tons of other shows that were being used. What happened to clever and original writing? It is not on this series.<br/><br/>
All I can say is, that if you watch this series, is that it takes forever to get one point across it is so dragged out -- like 15 minutes to get one statement out. Long and draw out is not being a clever writing tool, but leaves viewers want to tune out. Get to the point and stop the slow process of saying nothing in such a long period of time<br/><br/>One of my favorite characters gutted into a boring daytime soap opera style of badly acted drama .. This is a version geared toward the dark side that is mainstream America as we know it!! Gone is the comic version of how Sabrina is supposed to be!! Gone is the fun loving adaptation of the original tv show!! Replacing what Sabrina is supposed to be is a smirking, cocky, dark & pretty much evil version!! WHY? Why do things have to be dark & evil anymore? Why can't they be fun loving like they are meant to be!! The original comic & show are meant to take people away from the dark, depressing world we all live in this day & age!! Also, why add in the Sabrina has to make a choice between the two worlds? She is a part of the Archie's comics & there was no problem with her being in both places!! Enough Netflix!! Stop ruining almost every show you touch!!! Lastly, the people that have given this show good ratings & reviews are of two kind!! The paid to give it good reviews & the others are ones you best not trust because if this makes them smile, just imagine what's going through there head!! People are not like they once were where we could watch horror and other dark inspired things for entertainment!! The majority of the young generation are impressionable with what they watch & will try to copy what they see!! As a fan of both the comics and the original light hearted comedy, I was thrilled to see a bit of a blend-in of both being brought to life. In a way, still am, after having finished the show. I remain hopeful that it can eventually get much better, if the effort is put into it.<br/><br/>The reviews stating the lack of focus of the character's morals, as I have found, are entirely accurate. Now you could chalk talks about transgenderism and teenage girls being "Girl power, f* yeah!" to simply being teenage girls in this day and age.
You could; but it's clear the show doesn't take it that way.<br/><br/>"But what if I want Satan to give me ALL of the powers and NONE of the responsibility so I can do whatever I want?!" is Sabrina's most awkwardly incoherent statement in the show. A statement that basically makes her somehow miss the fact that probably making a pact with the lord of hell to willy-nilly use the natural forces without any rules -may not be a great thing on a large scale-, considering she by this point is seemingly aware of her skills (and by extension any other witch's) involves such fun things as mind control, long range body mutilation of others, effortless curses that kill you slowly and painfully, and the list goes on.
Yet nevermind the fact that the otherwise clever and cultured Sabrina royally skips over all of this to justify that "she doesn't wanna", again we could chalk this to her being a teenage girl and so yadda yadda.
How does the hundred years old witch bully squad answer to her on the subject? "Well the devil IS a man, it terrifies him that we could have both power AND freedom."<br/><br/>This is finally when the "oh, okay then." sinks in for me with the overall double-handedness of the show. You could chalk all of the moronic, unfair, single-sided behavior Sabrina goes through as part of her immatureness - the fact that she literally makes a group of bullies sexually assault each other by luring them to a cave offering them sex and instead attempting to black-mail them by taking pictures of them and saying she will post them all over the school, the fact that she ignores her aunts and cousin effectively being cannibals and eating any unwanted corpse that is brought to their mortuary shop, the fact that her aunts kill each other to relieve stress because they happen to have a revival ground, the fact that her 200+ years old cousin is in house arrest because he TRIED TO BLOW UP THE VATICAN!, hell, the fact that her whole witch society is built around murdering, backstabbing and sacrificing one another in the name of the lord of hell because "he isn't that bad, really.", not to mention witches turning out to be capable of literal child murder OF THEIR OWN as part of their initiations without giving the slightest of second thoughts about it.
All of that Sabrina has at most a mild annoyance towards, if even that at all. She does a thing that sometimes solves it, sometimes doesn't even acknowledge it, and then the matter is promptly discarded from her brain.<br/><br/>Now Sabrina's principal bans "controversial" books and her black oppressed friend is sad that she doesn't get to do what she wants in school? ? BAM, Sabrina goes RAGE MODE! She finds out his most traumatic fear of spiders and swarms him with a vision of being eaten alive by them. Yeah.
This doesn't stem just from this however! This is also due to the local school bullies for some reason taking to really be into harassing her transgender or otherwise really masculine looking female friend. You might think, they shove her around or insult her and nobody does anything about it, standard american show.
Nope, no sir. They strip her of her shirt and beat her up after, seemingly!
A matter that flies past absolutely everyone; teachers, parents, principal, vice-principal. Even the girl's own father seemingly never boards the subject of her school situation. There is absolutely no indication of this sort of things being tolerated around the town in any fashion, yet nobody has any cut on the subject in any level, not even passingly mentioned on screen by anyone else.
Because well, that would not let Sabrina be justified in her actions, now would it?<br/><br/>So the show goes on and these ridiculous, obnoxious inconsistencies continue to play over and over and over. Making the amazing actors behind Sabrina's aunts and the otherwise rather clever writting of some of her antics be rather moot in light of her blatant, violent hypocrisy and the director's clear intent in letting you know it's okay to inflict massive physical and psychological harm on any white male that doesn't know any better regarding his choices so long as she has no personal care for them, but the moment it's anyone else, Sabrina's gonna be right back on the Satan hotline to give you a nice, warm share of self-righteous social justice. Thank Satan she is there to stop the patriarchy! Where do I start. Firstly you would have to have a severely messed up and damaged person who thinks the occult is fine, with all its dark powers, but a book being banned is terrible. However the occult is presented in such a way that the only problem with satanists is selling your soul to a man, shudders. Also they're witches who barely do any witchcraft.<br/><br/>The episodes themselves are a hot mess of themes that jump around with all the grace of a flapping Homer Simpson. From patriarchy to possession no small subject is too big and no big subject is too small.<br/><br/>Make no mistake as well this is aimed squarely at teens. Especially ones who spend all day tweeting about the latest social injustice and why James Bond isn't a woman, even though you don't really know who James Bond is.<br/><br/>Then onto the cast. I'll split this:<br/><br/>Sabrina - very Mary Sue. Solves a puzzle in five minutes that had been unsolved for decades, really? In general though she is ok, but there's nothing of the witch world about her, except her ability to do everything without trying.<br/><br/>She just seems like a high school kid, who doesn't really like Satan so will form a committee to tell him so.<br/><br/>You want to see a conflict not just in terms of choice but in terms of morality and personality. There's none. She'll gladly perform all sorts of spells on men, but feel guilt that her friends book has been banned.<br/><br/>High school - a tick all boxes group of bland characters, that make the occult seem appealing to even the most devout Christian.<br/><br/>Diversity in itself is fine, but if the most diverse thing about the character is their race or gender then there's a problem.<br/><br/>Witch world - love the aunts, they really contrast each other well and Michelle Gomez is amazing, but everyone else is pretty dull. The main villain is less scary than Oj Simpson. They're salty satanists, but never come across as the type of people who would sell their soul to the devil. You see truly evil bit characters sometimes, who's impact is dulled by the fluffy main characters. Hellwarts school for witches anyone.<br/><br/>Salem - he's just stuck on as a cheap attempt to get original viewers. CGI him if she's allergic. I mean an actual cat isn't going to talk is it?<br/><br/>Overall it's like a quilt that many people have made that has no correlation to each of the other parts.<br/><br/>Finally it's the best advertisement for Christianity ever. I mean who'd go to hell if it was this boring? I still got my sisters Sabrina the Teenage Witch DvDs lying around so I thought to myself: Give the new one a try. A darker tone, a bit less family friendly is going to spice things up.<br/><br/>Man, I was so wrong. Sabrina is one-dimensional, she is special, I get that but she receives no real backstory. The same goes for almost all characters, bad guys are bad, good guys are good.<br/><br/>Right after ten minutes into the show the already chilled down viewer is greeted with the first 'misogyny', 'patriarchy' and masculinity used as an insult. The schools director does not believe women and overall it does sound like a flashcard for a inter-sectional feminism class. Teen issues are non-existent, except when they can be politicized. You really want to have a strong female character that does not look like a Mary Sue? Go take notes from Buffy. Very demonic, satanic etc
Very dark
Not my cup of tea
The need to chill with the satanic stuff Good show but Sabrina is laughable. A Sixteen year old who thinks she can out smart an ancient Diety?
The worst part is that the Sabrina character is naive and stupid but ofcourse because she is a feminist, she thinks she is the smartest in the whole world!!!!
She is THE hypocrite but the show doesn't address this.
Good show but the character is obtuse and naive. Keep politics out of entertainment. It's annoying, hypocritical and ruins an otherwise very well produced show. I'm trying would be a great show and overall I really enjoy it. But there is way too much teen drama. The Sabrina actress is absolutely replaceable and doesn't bring any positive to the show. Why did u do it netflix ? why ? why did u take our fav show frm childhood & ruined it beyond recovery. Riverdale itself is a mediocre show & d same director for sabrina. I don know where to start d show is nothin about magic , spells , good visuals or for dat matter a storyline.The visuals are cheap as if its shot in a freaking tent !. The actings skills of most of the actors including sabrina sometimes not dat fascinating. It could have been a beautiful show instead one having cheap background scenes , overacting, 0 storyline & poor poor direction. Even if its a new adaptation & not a remake it could have been so mch more about the witches & spells & magic rather than js a girl trying to prove her point & claim her freedom.How is that witchery ? Not sure what they are trying to show. Bad bad bad show man One of the things I like about teen dramas is that they are great at allowing the exposition of current modern affairs through the eyes of people coming of age and thinking about this issues really seriously. For this to work the presentation has to be subtle and thoughtful - after all if you can deliver a great line that makes the protagonist see something in a new light then chances are a lot of the audience will as well. What doesn't work is when you have a single message that you constantly just scream over and over. That just makes people retreat into their trench. The delivery backfires.<br/><br/>And this is what we see with this series. It opens up some really interesting questions but the antagonists are so unrealistic and one dimensional that it no longer becomes thought provoking. And I'm not talking about the witches here - the most unrealistic characters are the mortals. If you have not heard of intersectionalism then you should know that it is the idea that there is a power hierarchy of oppressor and victim, and the more minority boxes you can tick off then the more of a victim you are. This then combines with the idea that any form of hate / discrimination is only bad if you are doing it to someone more of a victim that you are. I present this as it seems like this is the main idea behind the writing of the show. And this becomes a problem because instead of presenting the ideas of "we are all equal, but look what this person has to go through compared to you", it presents the idea that anyone with more 'power' on the intersectionlist pyramid is a valid target of attack. This backfires because rather than trying to use empathy to bring people together, it uses hate to drive people apart.<br/><br/>And there is just no escaping it in this show. If it were a reference here and there then it would be absolutely fine - all shows have some political perspective (if you think it doesn't then that's probably because it has the same one you do). But the problem is that it becomes jarring because the writing is so bad it contradicts itself.<br/><br/>The most obvious example is when Susie is being bullied by some football jocks. Without any evidence Sabrina decides to take matter into her own hands and exact revenge on these boys. A witch hunt, although Sabrina says she does not care for the term, is exactly what she decides to go on. Guilty until proven innocent and it is all completely acceptable. A few episodes later Sabrina is accused of breaking a promise. Again no evidence is provided, but as Witch Law is guilty until proven innocent she could be in trouble. She protests at the unfairness of a situation which she herself was recently a perpetrator of. But no lesson is given as to her behaviour, it is simply presented as her being the victim.<br/><br/>And that's the main message of the show - all men are bad (but the black ones are not quite as bad as the others). Harvey's dad, for example, wants him to give up on any future he might have (at age 16) to start working down the mine with him, as if male parents never want to work hard to give their children a better future than they have had themselves. Indeed it is curious that all 4 friends are from dysfunctional families none of which have a mother. And when a stag is killed on a hunting trip and Sabrina asks "who would do such a thing?" the obvious reply is "men would".<br/><br/>And it makes you lose empathy not increase it. If the Headmaster is unwilling to allow books with tough controversial topics to be allowed in the school (as if he has total control over these things), then it is a perfectly reasonable thing to torture him so that he takes a day off of work so that a club can be formed that he may not approve of.<br/><br/>If the writing were better they could have presented these things in a much stronger light that would not have people turning away but actually thinking about the situation. See the great comedy show Nanette by Hannah Gadsby as a way to present a situation that evokes thought and empathy as an example of how these issues can be further brought to light.<br/><br/>Oh, and the schoolkids all look about 30. Otherwise the acting is good (especially the 5 main adults), and some of the plot points are interesting. I like how they took one episode off to present a perfectly in-keeping with the narrative one off thriller episode. And other than Sabrina all the characters are quite consistent (even if it makes them a bit bland).<br/><br/>Worth a try to see if the politics won't put you off. I've made it to the end despite it being jarring in places. It's entertaining enough to make it worth the effort, but you may get to the end and wonder if your time was better used to something else. Wasted potential that better writers would have fixed. The culture wars have hit IMDB hard.<br/><br/>I wrote a review complaining about the show being more political than entertaining and they took it down.<br/><br/>So, I'm writing another one, and saying the same thing. When I sit down to watch a show about a teenage witch, I want to watch a show about a teenage witch, I don't want to sit down and be attacked for my race, gender, and sexuality.<br/><br/>I find that offensive and it's something don't I care to watch. No one likes to be told that they are evil just because of who they are.<br/><br/>And, IMDB admins, since you will no doubt read this, it's offensive that you'd take a review down because of partisan politics, when the show itself is about partisan politics. So one episode in and I'm not feeling it. Might revisit when the other shows I watching are on hiatus Why does every show have to spend 80% of the runtime preaching to me and pushing some political message. Where's the actual entertainment???The last thing i wanted when watching Sabrina was feminism and political issues. The whole point of watching entertainment shows is NOT hearing about political issues. If i want to hear about politics and feminism i can just watch one of the news channels. i really wanted to like that show and i was hoping it would be good.
The same goes for Charmed 2018 and many shows these days One day maybe Netflix and Hollywoof might make a movie or mini series that just entertains you instead of lecturing you and preaching far left saw politics into your life STOP the stupid musical. It detracts from the storyline and important development. Season 1 was amazing and had a wonderful witchy, New England feel to it. Now it feels like a show I never watched: Glee! Just stop. The writers are already disappointing with the boring tropes, lazy writing, "woke" messages, and Theo. Nobody cares about her arc. By the way, Hecate is a pagan, ancient GREEK deity, just like Pan and Circe. Making them bad guys while the coven prays to Hecate and Aphrodite made no sense! The lack of continuity is baffling. Also, the Green Man is a symbol of life and rebirth. Yet the writers made it out to be evil. The writers created a mess in Season 3. Basically Sabrina is a magic feminist at a poorly lit Hogwarts. Childish arrogant naive character Sabrina, a cry babe needing attention and care whilst she ain't admit This is my first review and deservingly so. Its cheeky, daramatic, pleasantly gory, and it has perfect moments of needed comedy. NETFLIX did a great job with this one. The trailer and title sequence all teased to being aware of the source material that this new series is based upon. And yet I went into the first episode confused as to why they kept most of the characters, changed the plot, changed the characters personalities and even failed to capture the tone of the comic book series.<br/><br/>The series' cast not only managed to be subpar but the script also managed to kill any performance and interactions between characters. Nevermind the convoluted plot line.<br/><br/>I still wonder why they felt the need to take a perfectly good story line and rewrite it to this snooze fest. Great marketing though. If you've ever considered making a show that addresses every social justice issue (legit or contrived) on the mind of every white twenty-something born to white guilt suffering, gender shamed, virtue signal practicing upper middle class parents. Then move on, that show has already been made..."Chilling Adventures of Sabrina".<br/><br/>Too bad, overall the story is dark and compelling. The acting is dialed in for the dark environment. But with all the SJ issues shoehorned in, it is for me like adding coconut to carrot cake. My favorite cake ruined by the food I hate the most. Regardless of how much I enjoy the culmination of all the other ingredients added together, they just can't overcome the overwhelming flavor of coconut. This show had all the potential to be really good, but the writers couldn't overcome their self righteous piety long enough to leave their politics out. Shame... That's it. I could not stand to keep watching this show. Just twenty minutes into the first episode, and the series already is trying to sold us this feminist propaganda without a good reason for it. I had no time to care about the characters, and it's like almost everyone in this show's world is an a**hole in one way or another.<br/><br/>I really was in love with the idea of a more darker version of Sabrina to watch this Halloween... But this was just a political agenda presented in the form of a Netflix series. Avoid it like the plague if you hate to be preached by the media. Stupidest writing ever.
Just one example: The court calls themselves "dishonorable" Seriously? What 12 year old wrote this?
The protagonist THE most annoying person EVER. First off there's too much going on. And always there's a back story coming along with the main story to support what she is doing. Makes all of the witches and everyone seem absolutely corny and simple-minded. Makes a devil look like an idiot. And even though there in modern times they still act like how they were centuries before. If you're going to have beings that are so powerful and everything else then show them as that not as people who can barely use their mind to out-think anything else and say praise Satan every 2 minutes. The main actress is a good lead she's the only one in this whole series that seems to be fit for the part. I don't blame the actors or actresses for this though it seems definitely to be the writers After recently reading the comics of the same title, I was extremely excited for this series. I found it a refreshing spin on the original 90's version, which was cute but I was never that in to it. But, honestly you really can't call this a remake. My biggest issues are with Sabrina's annoying damn friends. This ridiculous obsession with Harvey and the hypocrisy that is her "i don't want to join the club but i want the benefits" mindset. Like it exhausting watching her put her friends and family in danger constantly and then turn around and say she's doing it all so that she can maintain her freedom. Overall i still like the show and some of the main characters, but it's a bit tiresome watching Sabrina's silly character run all over the place. The number of times we see an 18 year old (supposedly 15 year old) Kiernan Shipka naked and dripping water in just the first episode alone is nasty.<br/><br/>The first episode in a nutshell :<br/><br/><ul><li>Witches are satanists. All those witch trials were right!</li><li>Witches are cannibals. Because, y'know, the Dark Lord likes that.</li><li>Bathing in blood is groovy and great for the skin!</li><li>Torturing someone for personal gain is the bestest thing EVER!</li><li>Salem is a scary demon who turns into a purring kitten for reasons.</li><li>Patriarchy! Lots and lots of heavy handed patriarchy!</li></ul><br/><br/>They TRY to bring in how 'woke' they are with things like a non-binary character, but ugh. It's not even enough to begun to balance.<br/><br/>It's creepy-horror, rather than thriller-horror, and it's pretty terrible. The story telling is so slow. Like the old school zombies this show has rigor mortise has set in. I was excited about this show but was bored and fell asleep during the first episode. The heavy political stuff is random and doesn't add to the story. The good:
So this show has a lot of promise, a lot of potential and it squandered it away.
I do not know who was in charge of casting in this, but they seriously failed at their job.<br/><br/>The feeling is pretty good to begin with, dark and iffy, and then it turns into half-way princess bride, half-way chainsaw texas massacre, which is... weird.. Not sure who falls into this category.<br/><br/>Zelda and Ambrose are the best thing about this show, esspecially Ambrose, he's the only really likable character, it falls down from there.<br/><br/>
The bad:
This show could of stayed away from politics, whenever shows like this push in 2018 politics you know from the start where the show is going to go. We've seen it before, we know how the directors think and we can basically just follow the step in the great: "liberal director book" from there. There's nothing exciting and genius about it, we've seen it. How can we not? Every newspaper, every CW teen show (or CW show in general) we've seen it on MTV, on disney esspecially the newest star wars movies. And yeah, I wish this show took a game of thrones approach to strong women, and less of a "wahmen are powerful, cuz we are wahmen!" the men vs women is a huge focus in this show, and it saps away from the magic, and becomes downright ridiculous.<br/><br/>The ugly:
I don't know if she's a brilliant actor, or that awful of an actor, but Sabrina is the worst part of the show. It's not her fault the script is the way it is, but she's really an extremely annoying character.<br/><br/>In one episode she gets tasked to open up a demon prison of some sort, and we find out that the headmaster has spent 20 years trying to open it, and a classmate of hers has tried for three years, he has also read extensively from her fathers journals. Sabrina solves it in one day using the journals finding out her mothers the key, which by the way everyone else seems to know more about than her, and yeah... (This is how the show set it up.. seriously..)<br/><br/>She seems to just ease through everything and with the necessities of making this a "horror / exciting show" scenes, we can quickly figure out she's too powerful/lucky to be in any real danger.<br/><br/>The show deserves a 3/10, I get that it has a higher rating, but that's because most professional reviewers rate on the checklist they have:<br/><br/>Diversity
Powerful matriarchy propaganda
SJW PC Politics
Everything else.<br/><br/>One thing I will say, the diversity cast is the least annoying in the entire show, for a show about Sabrina, it would do so much better, without Sabrina. I came into this knowing it wasn't going to be a light hearted remake, the way it's filmed has me hating it from the get go. The focus aspect is dizzying, anything that isn't centre looks completely out of focus and just gives a headache. The story seems ok, yet the acting isn't great, but I'm finding it hard to focus due to the lack of focus on the picture. I used to get home from school once upon a time in the 90's and enjoy Sabrina the teenage witch.
Sadly this reboot is just utter SJW gutter trash.
The show rams gender & identity politics so hard, fast & furious down your throat from the get go you're just stunned & can't get into it. Shame as the basic plot doesn't seem terrible at all. The SJW agenda being forced upon the viewers just completely destroys this.
C'mon Netflix, the average viewer does not care about your political ideology... they just want good well written entertainment. Imagine if Sam and Dean from supernatural, instead of fighting against monsters and ghosts, were fighting for Political Correctness, against patriarchy so on and so forth.
Well, that's Sabrina for you. Satanical Witches who kill people for fun are the heroes and the people who don't adhere to PC are the villains. Yeah, murder and hail satan are better than patriarchy. That's the message.
This is just not the place for these discussions. A dark fantasy should be filled with monsters, ghosts, folklore, curses and magic, not political correctness discussions.
This killed all the fun.
Let's see if the demographics netflix is trying to appease with this will be enough to keep this currently overated series alive but I doubt it. Camera has you checking your vision often along with some story and acting issues. Not a great show. Ambrose is the best thing about this show. This show has about 5% of the source material in mind. The characters, plot, the agenda shoving...It's nothing like the comic. It's a moronic, heavy political handed attempt to use the comic's popularity (and actual story telling) to push a teeny-boper show in place of the source material. I guessed it when they played sweet sixteen in the trailer, but I gave it a shot due to enjoying the comics. This show had great potential, but it forgot that there was source material. Instead the producers, writers, etc just dropped a bunch of SWJ messages in a hat, pulled some out, and wrote scripts around them. Was really looking forward to this comic adaptation. The first episode really got me interested. Then it turned into sjw propaganda. On episode 3 the girls are mad because some books aren't allowed in a PUBLIC SCHOOL library, and the headmaster says "Some books may be too much for impressionable youths. Like Clockwork Orange, or Lolita" and the girls are super mad about it and the patriarchy's heavy hand on tiny weak women. YOU'RE 15-YEAR-OLDS. How would you, reader, like your 13 year old reading 50 shades of grey in school? I'm ALL IN for equality and diversity, but once in a while, I'd just like to unplugged from the daily crap and jsut watch a stupid show without thinking of anything else. Pisses me off that I'd been waiting for weeks to watch this.
Also, neither whoever had the idea, nor whoever applied it, know how to work the blur effect. It's all over the place. I'm 2 episodes into it and am not enjoying it so far. The original series was indescribably superior in every way. In fact, this new series has absolutely no connection or similarity to the original one except the character names. It's as if it's piggybacking on the original one just to get people to watch it. Furthermore, the show seems more preoccupied with political correctness and making social statements that it is in producing a good and entertaining story. And the title says it all
Feminist intersectional misandrist racist satanist melodrama I'm a lover of dark, psychological thrillers or horror tv shows but this was just bad. It was not dark, not eerily creepy, no dimension. Salem doesn't even talk. The acting is poor, some of the actors are just so terrible or maybe it's just poor scripts. Nothing connects to one another, it just failed to grab my attention. I found myself focusing on other things. They could've done much better with this. The only thing I can compliment on is the setting of the show, the colours, their sets etc. I learned to tolerate politics injected in massive quantities into modern TV, as long as the writing is good. Having watched 1.5 episodes of this show, it's become blatantly obvious that the writing is really bad.<br/><br/>Nevermind the differences in source material, just the plain quality of this show makes its cheesy old "Sabrina" predecessor look like a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Everything is flat. The main actress is cast well, but she's given bad lines and her character is flat and uninteresting. Other actors don't even fare that well. They have bad lines and they're overacting, again, like subpar cartoon villains, firing off blatant expository dialogue.<br/><br/>They're not believable in the slightest. None of them are. I don't believe that character X lived in isolation for decades, or that character Y is wise enough to warrant their standing in that world.<br/><br/>They're all just actors in make-up. That is when you know - the show failed. I don't care if it's a remake or not. The series as a stand-alone is just plain bad. It comes down to being so political correct, and black friend, and gay friend and a boyfriend who's artistic.. like wtf. They make every bit of effort not to hurt anyone's feelings and Sabrina not only goes out of her way, but literally does everything no logically thinking girl would. Netflix took a good idea and incorporated a political agenda. I tried to give it a chance but the story line is garbage and the camera focus is terrible. The mass advert was how this is going to be dark and not kid friendly. Really?!! Blurry camera, doesn't make a series dark. A dark filter for all the places and gloomy ambiance doesn't make the genre dark. This is still kids stuff in my opinion. If kids aren't allowed to watch this, then they are just being coddled by overprotective parents.
Kiernan Shipka plays Sabrina who is the most annoying person I have seen in a series in recent times. During the watch I turned it off multiple times just to vent off the frustration that she was causing. I like the premise, the characters and their portrayal, except for Sabrina. May be I'm just too old to watch vexing teens going through puberty, but all the other characters in her school are fine. They are stereotypical but tolerable. I was able to sit through all the feministic vibe about her, but her struggle to choose between being a witch and a mortal is just not convincing. I wasn't able to empathize with her character. When a teenager is asked to choose between having superpowers or being the school's women rights group president, you choose superpowers. There, Sabrina fails once again for me. I like the portrayal of all the other characters, her aunts, the cousin, the high priest, her friends, even the dark lord, except for Kiernan Shipka's Sabrina. Kiernan Shipka should go back to school, this time an acting school. This is hard to watch. Boring. The story is predictable and been done many, many times. SAD It's kinda cool and kinda lame. First three episodes I had to fight but now I kinda like it, but it is still not clear what the mission should be and it takes forever... Whoever write the show don't have much common sense.
Sabrina doesn't know some holidays of witches and she disagrees with her aunts on many issues. It seems Sabrina just moved in yesterday instead of being raised by her family. Basically, Sabrina and her family do not share enough extent of trust, so she has to outsource help which is offered by Mary Wardwell, aka Lilith, quite often, which renders Sabrina in a vulnerable state.<br/><br/>Speaking of Mary Wardwell, she presented herself as a conservative woman with timid personality in the beginning of the first episode. Later on, she had a drastic change of her personality and no one got curious and wondered why. Then, she introduced herself as a witch excommunicated by her coven, and instantly the aunts buying her story without further confirmation is another example of convenient plot.<br/><br/>The show flops at the moment they decide to kill Tommy who's Harvey's caring and loving brother. Sabrina went through all the trouble trying to revive Tommy but she's scolded by her witch aunts. If you're rooting for Sabrina, you would feel frustrated for Sabrina and her family are unreasonable but if you're rooting against Sabrina, you would feel our leading character is a rebellious and selfish brat. This storyline doesn't please anyone and actually has very little impact on the whole story.<br/><br/>On top of that, the weird sisters who were the murderers of innocent miners went totally unpunished. I know many things are not necessarily black and white, but there must be a line somewhere; otherwise, it only shows lives of witches are more precious than humans and witches can do whatever they want without consequences. History already taught us the results of inequality among different races, do we really need a show to preach this idea?<br/><br/>After reading other reviews here, I'm aware many viewers are offended by the show's blatantly political statements. Good writers don't have to do that to tell their audience what's right and wrong; they demonstrate it by exquisite storytelling which the show apparently lacks. I wanted to give it a shot because in here I saw a 8.1 rating and that pushed me to watch. I didn't mind the feminist BS (nowadays we just have to put up with it everywhere), but what utterly bothered me is the stiffness of the whole thing. The overly worked and cliche images (houses, cars, fog, costumes, etc) ... and apart from that, the most action we've got is a stupid court argument... quite a pathetic one to be honest. And there hasn't been that much of magic to be honest. There were some cute images (dancing in the halloween party) but that's it.<br/><br/>I got to the 3rd but not sure if I'll continue. This show is over the top. In the show Sabrina compares being satanic to being Jewish. The acting is horrible and the characters unlikable. Like many other Netflix shows, it pushes a liberal agenda to the sacrifice of the show. This show should not be watched by anyone. Adults will find the show stupid, and kids will be told that being a satanist is cool. I am so disappointed with the casting of Sabrina I find her weak and unappealing I realise the original was supposed to be ditsy but this one is just vacuous. I do like that the content is more sinister, and some of the characters are established but overall just boring rubbish Why, why do they need to have characters, smoke?! I get it the smoking industry, needs to advertise, but this kind of show for younger audiences, need not have smoking! It disgusts to see it and keeps me from enjoying the show! If parents do not want their kids to start such a disgusting habit and have to be addicted to such a drug. They should not allow them to watch this show. WHEN WILL FULM MAKERS LEARN, THEIR IS NO NEED FOR THIS CRAP, TO MAKE A GOOD STORY TOLD! But, of course, you want the disgusting industries MONEY!<br/><br/>Again, this would have been more enjoyable, without character smoking! DISGUSTING! This review is coming from a person who has never read any Archies comics and never watched an episode of Riverdale. So watching "chilling adventures of Sabrina" was an introduction to a whole new character universe. And also because of that is this review is not written by any fanboy and is totally impartial.
The premise of the series was good and had really great plot. But it seems creators tried to include their own agendas into this. One thing a live action comic book series should do is to being what it is. Whole story felt like forced. Sabrina actions seemed like forced. At first se seem like a smart girl but in the middle of the series, she does some pretty stupid things that any smart person would avoid!!! Watching that felt so annoyed. She never had any good (I mean really good) reason for doing things what she did. I would advise other viewers to think before start watching this. This series could've been so much fun instead the makers wanted this to be about patriarchy? White male blah blah. Many of the character has no reason for what they are doing most of the time. I was cringing the whole time!! Surprised at the awful message of this show. Delivery is so cheery but sick, dark and wish I hadn't seen it. This show is a let down. It's full of leftist feminist agenda. But that's besides the point.<br/><br/>There was asteral projection, a dumb prank on jocks, and a guys memory getting erased. This is better than the charmed reboot but that's not saying much.<br/><br/>I still can't figure out what the overall plot is. The satanist angle is a annoying as well as the blurry camera every other shot. Like I get they probably didn't want to go the potter route but they could've done better than this. I'm guessing they took the bottom tier writers from the CW and struck a deal.<br/><br/>I gave it 3 stars for being more tolerable than the Charmed reboot. I thought we had moved beyond this bizarre idea.<br/><br/>This feels like a huge sticking point to what, in every other respect could be an awesome series. All witchea are evil. All the men are misogynist other than the boyfriend. Phrases like "topple the white patriachy". Magic is all evil.<br/><br/>Rediculous. The concept was great but it was just so political and biased I couldnt relate to any of the characters.<br/><br/>Truly dissapointed. I wanted to like this, and tried to like this (got through almost the whole thing, just kept hoping for it to get good). But they use the main character in a way that makes her just seem stupid and reckless to the point in which she starts resembling a lemming in my mind when watching her so that the show can get the ball rolling. Everyone else seems pretty much mentally present, but the main character just does almost everything a sane person wouldn't do. By the end of the series I was almost angry that Sabrina hadn't died yet for her actions at the point I stopped watching (not that teen angst can't be attributed to some of her actions, but no one is that ridiculous and survives for so long). My childhood consisted of Sabrina, Charmed and Buffy the Vampire slayer. I love the genre, and therefore I was so excited to see this come out. But oh my. What a disappointment this is. So full of cliches it made me cringe. The acting is also pretty mediocre. Missed opportunity... The smartest person in the room is the 15 year old. The men are pretty much dumb, evil, or gay. She must remain mortal so she can get her club going. Tired old story lines with gore and near nudity thrown in to get the kiddies watching. No thanks. Omg I want just to write that this series is so dark filmed that can't see shirt!! All the curtains on and still can't see in an oled TV duh
Also what is all about the nonsense with Satan and bad witches but they are actually good but they might not or they are or not or......... ENDLESS LOL
AND CHEAP CHEAP EFECTS I rarely write reviews but I felt the need to. As I said this is not a remake, Its a new adaptation of the Chilling Adventures of Sabrina comic that's been out for the past few years. So sorry anyone reading this if you think that this show is going to be the same as the light hearted sitcom you are going to be disappointed cuz this is NOT your parents Sabrina the Teenage Witch nor is it a kids show it's a dark story with a teenage lead, and unlike the sitcom Sabrina knows that she's a witch from the start which is also another thing from the comic. Also I've seen a few negative reviews here say that Salem was replaced by some random person her cousin, but just so you know Ambrose is in the comic so he's not out of nowhere and Salem is in it he just doesn't talk. As for the negative reviews from people throwing out the words "Agenda" and "Propaganda" simply because It has the young characters making a women's rights club, has non white characters and a transgendered teen? God forbid they make a show about a teenage girl with powers have at least some feminism and diversity in it, but I guess some people just want to feel threatened by that so don't listen to them. I guess they never watched Buffy the Vampire Slayer which had all of that. I will admit that it might seem disconcerting to see all the satanist witches stuff at first, but if you watch the second episode you will realize that this supposed "real free will" religion is an illusion, there are even more rules, restrictions and hypocrisy than any other one. Anyway the only other thing I was disappointed with was they did take out the Salem can talk thing from the comic cuz I found him amusing but but other than that The whole season was great, the cinematography is excellent and all the actors do a great job. Come on Hollywood. Stop pushing the super liberal agenda of "white man bad" and all things feminism and LGBTQ. It is gettong old. I want to be entertained, not lectured to. Great show if you can get passed the obvious At the beginning I was amazed by show, loved the touch of horror and crime, loved the conflict between aunties/sisters Zelda and Hilda. But, few last episodes were boring mainly because of main character Sabrina. Why she can't be smart, wicked, good and bad in same time. They had to ruin her with '' choose help from stranger, over your own family?! " seriously?! Waiting for season 2 to see if they will change the way how they will proceed with Sabrina character. The rest of the characters are amazingly good written. Characters were predictable as the show follows the politically correct fad to include every minority group. Sabrina has a gay cousin, a trans friend, a black friend, and the show continuously pushes a political agenda. I was excited to watch a new take on Sabrina the witch, but ended up watching an exhausting blurry montage of unlovable characters, boring character (no) development, and too much satanic references. I'm truly disappointed. What a waste of potential! Such a stupid show with stupid storylines and dumb, horny actors Why, why would they make the heroine the most annoying, unlikeable character ever?<br/><br/>Season 1 was somewhat enjoyable, Season 2 less so, but wow, season 3... watching it felt like eating a very large, very cheap piece of steak. You don't like it, but you keep eating it in the hopes it'll get better. And you've already started, so may as well push forward. When it's over you regret everything.<br/><br/>First off, the sets look like they cost $20, and that wouldn't have even mattered had the writing not been so, SO bad. The low budget sets were the least problematic issue (even though they go to freaking Hell of all places... come on? You referenced Bosch, where is the inspiration??)<br/><br/>Ah yes, the writing was truly terrible. Among many atrocious moments, there was a scene at the end where the writers were literally like, "Oh, there needs to be a conflict here to drive the plot forward. So let's have Sabrina do the most stupid, nonsensical thing she could possibly do. There, now she's in trouble. Problem solved!" You can't just do that. It's just the laziest form of writing possible.<br/><br/>Second, there was WAY too much exposition. I guess that can't be helped if you're basically inventing all the rules to a crazy made-up universe... but again, lazy writing. You can make anything work if there's believability. Take Harry Potter for instance - the world and the witchcraft is totally believable, even when there are CGI kids for crying out loud. Here it's all tell and no show, nonexistent and inconsistent rules.<br/><br/>All this was made worse due to the poor acting all around. When Aunt Hilda is the best character in the entire season, there's a problem. Oh, and what's up with the random musical numbers? Please stop. It's not cute, it's cringe.<br/><br/>Just because it's a show about witches, it needs to feel like there are stakes. Here there are none, even when the stakes were a matter life and death. I think I'll pass on season 4. This is could have been a great series, however Kieran Shipka's character "Sabrina" spoils it all. If you cannot stand a Mary Sue at all then I would not recommend this series. Sabrina is a very frustrating character in this series, her actions are very stupid makes the audience want to put their hands on their heads. Also the Harvey and Sabrina drama is very frivolous to the story. There are many small issues with the series but I'm going to leave it behind. The series is a not well made feminist series as it makes the misogynists in the series very predictable and one dimensional.However, the rest in this is very good, the aesthetic refreshing and memorable and undoubtedly Madam Satan played by Michelle Gomez is the best treat in the series. I like the overall premise of the show. The SJW element is so worn out though. Nothing wrong for expressing views on womens's, LGBTQ right etc. but it was way overdone... The whole basketball scene where the girl who wasn't not good at all was given talent by Sabrina to show up the boys actually gives the opposite meaning... They should have had a girl with actually talent who needed no help to show the boys what's up...I will continue to watch to see how it all unfolds but not something I would put at the top of the list. Awfully written, predictable and contrite.
It's like some one really drunk watched Buffy and Sabrina, and then woke up the next day and tried to explain it. Netflix has become a campaign to promote toxic feminism and this series is one of the dozens that's been released recently.It's clear that their shows are for a segment of people and they've been pedantic about it.<br/><br/>Each element of the show was top notch except for the writing.Keeping the characteristics of the show pristine could've saved this show.<br/><br/>Can't remember the last time i watched a netflix show and enjoyed it thoroughly,I guess that's my cue to unsubscribe from the channel. I liked the first two seasons. They were kind of quirky and fun. Something is definitely wrong with this season. Sabrina is stupid and irresponsible, an absolute idiot. There are different plots going in every direction. None of the characters seem interested or able to focus on anything except how much they can pant over their boy/girlfriends. Someone has really ruined this show. The more episodes I watch, the worse it gets. I really can't stand Sabrina right now. The first episode didn't even finish and there is already a female character identifying as non-binary and Sabrina and friends have gotten together a group of "girls" (I put that in quotes because they don't all consider themselves girls, even though they're all female), to topple the White male patriarchy.<br/><br/>I kid you not.<br/><br/>All of this, meanwhile, is done as if it's the most natural thing in the world.<br/><br/>This is not the "Sabrina" that I grew up watching and loved. This is what would happen if you dropped acid and browsed Tumblr while watching reruns of Sabrina the Teenage Witch.<br/><br/>It's a shame, I adore Michelle Gomez. But, this is just too chilling to watch - and not in the fun, Aliens anthology kind of way, but in the skin-crawling, deeply concerned for humanity kind of way... A vehicle to promote satanism and feminism (which are almost the same thing).<br/><br/>Too bad as a good remake would have been welcome. Couldn't make it past 30 minutes, in that time they made it about the patriarchy, wypipo, girls that look like guys, oppressive school mates, and I think something about magic was briefly mentioned. You can't pick all of the social topics to get mad at.
Script was bad too, Sabrina is too fake just like the other characters, way too forced Another netflix show to fall asleep to. I thought this might be alright but it is poorly written and moves along at the speed of a snail. Great comprehensive seasonal arc but the dialogue was very contrived, a shared weakness with Riverdale in my opinion. The politics are a little too intense but easier to ignore over time, something that can't be said for Sabrina's two mortal friends who I found completely repulsive. Kiernan Shipka definitely carries the cast by making Sabrina one of the only multi-dimensional characters in the show. Very interesting take on Sabrina the teenage Witch and much better than the original series I must say but there are some things that I find rather annoying with the series.<br/><br/>For one, the writing and plot is very cliche at some points and not great and the main character can be annoying as well (Think Salem, Buffy, Charmed, AHS: Coven). And the setting in time is not really needed. This should have just taken place in 2018 so it could have been crossed over with Riverdale because the writing is so similar and the lingo and clothes seem too modern. Harvey even mentions The Goonies which came out in 1985. Also I am all for diversity in characters but in 1962 realistically Ros wouldn't be acknowledged let alone be able to raise a protest. Maybe in the 70s but the 60s is a bit of a stretch.<br/><br/>The three evil bitches are also annoying showing up in almost every episode where they're not really needed.<br/><br/>And wtf is Aunt Hilda fat? Not that it's anything wrong with it but I am used to seeing her thin. It took a while to get used to.<br/><br/>If you're looking for something fun and light and not taken too seriously then this show is it. Although the plot is a bit dark it's not really that scary.<br/><br/>Overall its great to watch if you like supernatural shows but it's not anything new. So it gets 6 stars from me. Watching this made me realize how much I appreciated the old teenage Sabrina who loved having fun with magic and has teenage stuff to deal with rather than Having Satan trying to court you. It's not even interesting to watch once the baptism stuffs over. Acting is average. Nobody acts like a real person, I guess they were going for that. It's trying too hard to create agendas about feminism and bullying which is fine, for spreading a good message but a storyline has to flow naturally, which in this case it doesn't. Netflix's take on Sabrina the Teenage Witch is dark-so dark that you can't actually see most scenes. And it's aimed in a dangerous direction. This show glorify violence toward white males and justify it by saying that society oppress women, people of colour, people who don't accept the body in which they are born etc... it is an act of mediatic terrorism. How else could you define it? No, the western society is not misogynistic, on the contrary it is far too tolerant otherwise shows such as these won't even exist. If feminists desire so much to fight for women issues then they should aim their hatred at places where women are actually oppressed like India or Iran. Most male students do not sexually assault female students, if that happens the police is out to stop them and women are not denied jobs or rights based on their sex.<br/><br/>Yes, my culture, and all the wonderful things it has to offer to the world, is under threat. Because angry feminists are trying to emasculate white men and always make them appear as scum. I'm tired of seeing myself and my kin portrayed always as villains. This is not equality, this is hatred. Sadly there is nothing compelling about Sabrina's mortal world, and no enjoyment to be found in the witch world either, which is just relentlessly dark and dismal. There's nothing there which gives a reason to why she wants to be part of either. Her mortal friends are a tickbox list of millenial cliches with absolutely nothing interesting about any of them, while everyone in the witch world are either outright evil or tortured in some way by what they are. Neither is appealing, which is at the heart of why this show just doesn't ever hit the mark.<br/><br/>It wants to add a feminist spin to the idea of witches being given powers in exchange for loss of freedom, through their pact with the devil, with Sabrina standing up as a feminist and demanding both power and freedom - great idea! - but does it in such a badly thought through way, it just doesn't ever land. Worse, it comes across as obnoxious through her actions. Sabrina uses her witch powers to torment bullying 'jocks' (forcing them to sexually assault each other, yikes) and an uptight principal, but has no problem with her own family desecrating corpses, eating bits of them, or casually murdering each other for kicks.<br/><br/>The base problem with the show is that there is absolutely nothing new or fresh in it. All of the storylines are borrowed early Buffy the Vampire Slayer stuff (witches taking on a teacher's form, possessed principals, sleep demons) without any characters to root for to make it enjoyable.<br/><br/>But I will say that it's not a lost cause at least. If the show could just add some fun to Sabrina's life, some stakes in relation to her friends, get rid of that awful blurry filter that creeps in way too much, and stop recycling plotlines from far better shows, it has the potential to be a lot better. Unfortunately, I only made it to Episode 5 and just got so bored, I had to switch off. Kiernan Shipka, Lucy Davis and Michelle Gomez. What could go wrong! A lot apparently. Most of which can be blamed on the writing. Their acting is outstanding as usual although can't say the same for Sabrina's friends. Five minutes in to the show and the social commentary comes flying fast. Horribly too. In a world where the main character is a Satanic witch it just seems out of place and forced. The show also seems to have trouble realizing who the main audience is. The scares and tense moments feels like an adult horror movie but when Sabrina is hanging with her annoying friends it feels like a teen drama. In conclusion the show is a big mess but I'm sure Kiernan Shipka well no have trouble finding work in the future. Her acting is the only good thing to come from this mess of a show. I saw the trailers for this series; I thought it looked interesting, so I decided to give it a shot. Man, did I regret it; thirty minutes in, and I'm already getting brainwashed about how white men are evil pigs. We only have less than a handful of male protagonists in this show, but they are all pushovers. None of them say a single word when women are spousing their disgusting biases against their gender. Instead, like proper betas they just awkwardly remain silent, and pretend like they aren't even being attacked. Even though all of this is irritating, it wouldn't have completely turned me off from the show if this abominable premise wasn't the main idea of it. Every single mortal subplot that I watched is about evil male principals, evil boy teenagers, or evil male fathers, and the main witch plot is all about the evil male dictator named Satan (they make sure to bash your brains in with the male part).<br/><br/>This has terrible writing. I cringed at the emotional scenes because the characters are such blank slates, and carry no weight at all. The show is painfully predictable; I could guess how the situation would conclude with like 100% accuracy. There are weird plot-points that go nowhere at all, and the main actor doesn't help ease the pain at all. She probably felt so noble and proud about how woke she was that she forgot how to act. Another issue was how the exposition was so weirdly placed and executed: I don't understand how a girl can actually grow up with witches that brag about eating humans, and not be completely brainwashed to obey Satan by now, much less, know about what she needs to do to become a full blown witch.<br/><br/>The only positive for me in here is the atmosphere, and unless you watch shows for far left propaganda, and atmosphere, this will more than likely not appeal to you. 'Oh, Harvey, you priviledged white idiot. This is what equality looks like to our coddled generation - and to the film companies that are desperate to engage and identify with us'.<br/><br/>.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. It's OK. The acting isn't the high quality of other Netflix originals.<br/><br/>The disappointment comes in the form of constant man-bashing.<br/><br/>From the jocks who are portrayed as misogynistic, intolerant morons who only think with their genitals to the male character of the devil expecting a female character to kiss his feet<br/><br/>Predictably the only males that are painted in a good way are those that are subservient to female characters.<br/><br/>In all it lead to a show that basically boiled to a message of men are bad and women or good. A feminist's wet dream.<br/><br/>It's a shame Netflix couldn't become a bastion of true equality rather than trotting out feminism dressed up as equality. If you're interested in the story and lore of this show but don't like to be preached at or literally told what's going through words of the characters, go read the book. The book is fun, scary, and actually good. Everything this show is not. I don't know why the butchered the book so terribly in this show but I'm going to go on and forget this show even exists. I suggest you do the same. This is not a reboot of the beloved 1996 series!
Remember everything you loved about the original series? You will not find any of that in this horrible exploitation piece.<br/><br/>This is, however, a cheaply made Canadian drama and retitle it into something more palatable for American Audiences. Fans of the original series will be particularly annoyed and insulted.<br/><br/>I can only assume they had no one doing continuity on this series. Sabrina's Aunts are played by English Actress Lucy Davis as Hilda and Australian Actress Miranda Otto as Zelda. I don't know which is more annoying Davis using a distinctly British accent, or Otto using the "Australian pretending to be American" accent. Neither of them speak with the same accent as Sabrina, or the other characters.<br/><br/>The pilot make a lot of hollow posturing about "Women's rights" and "empowering girls". They toss out phrase slike "White Patriarchy " and the like.... and yet the driving premise of the pilot episode is whether or not Sabrina will "submit to the Dark Lord". The lesson here is that lip service will be given to women, but when it really matters they have to give themselves to a powerful Male.<br/><br/>There is a lot of political posturing here. There is as lot, a disturbing amount of references to Dark arts, and serving Satan and the like. This is a children' series which is not even remotely suitable for children.<br/><br/>Ross Lynch plays Sabrina's boyfriend Harvey. Ross Lynch who has been a Disney Star for years. The producers have emasculated him. Dyed his hair a shoe polish brown, and given him the most unflattering haircut. And, any trace of Lynch's natural charisma has been carefully emasculated. Dark doesn't mean you have to put real problems like bullying girl in a boys body in a show, just because the show will be known to all. If you are adapting a comic you should know the side characters too. Not equal to the haunting of Hill house. Could be much better. I was sad to see this show trying to make youth witchcraft look cool and socially acceptable. It's very sad how far we've deviated from moral Christian values that we would even allow a show like this to air. No wonder our youth is so confused and troubled now a days. I was pretty stoked for this show. It seemed cozy and entertaining to watch around the halloween holiday.
I made some quesadillas and watched the first episode. It didn't take long before I was disappointed ointed.
First off, the intro sounded like something from Nickelodeon. Not fitting at all.
Next up, instead of just having an interesting and somewhat original story to make you want to follow and get sympathy with the characters, they show down SJW politics down our throats. It would have been fine if they just mentioned injustice at the school and fought that. But when they used words like "male white patriarchy" and calling someone racist without even explaining or showing that character even being or doing anything remotley racist, it just gets annoying and agenda pushing. Extremly poorly attempt to place metoo, BLM or womens march politics into a 60's show. Or is it a 60's show?? One character all of a sudden sits with a laptop in his knee... One of many continutity errors I noticed. And what's up with the wierd lense. It almost made me nauseous after a while when they make everything blurry.<br/><br/>Im not on Netflix to watch Agenda pushing. Then I could just put on CNN or visit buzzfeed or something. Im done! Thank god The Haunting Of Hill House was amazing at least. That made this halloween weekend good anyway Its a mess,its like they dident know what direction they should go.they went for dark,fantasy,horror and ended up with #metoo girlpower,men stupid. I love the darkness very much and the aesthetics are beauitful, and even though i do like that they are dealing with liberal ideas it just seems they are badly going about it. It's too forced! I love LQBTQIA+ characters getting air time but the way they have written it all out seems strange. Like it doesn't fit correctly.
It needs to be more natural and fluid.<br/><br/>I'm also confused about the direction they want Sabrina (the show as a whole) to go in.
Also by the whole satan thing.<br/><br/>I'm only on episode 3 and I'm really having to push through. I have to say Sabrina is a very dark. Kissing Satan aka Dark one ass. It's over rated. I feel like I'm watching a cult tv show. I have agree with others politics could stayed out of the show. I'm all for support groups. But the movement rights was a little over the top. I as currently I'm in episode 6. With dream witch. The show is growing on me. But will watch it to the end. The show has this horrible blur effect over random scenes that doesn't mean anything, it's just thrown on top of random scenes with no rhyme or reason. Several scenes are jarring or headache inducing, it feels like a blurry shaky cam "reenactment" on those dodgey murder investigation shows.<br/><br/>I also find the story all over the place. Sabrina's aunts are protagonists but they're cannibalistic satanist witches actively working for the forces of evil who celebrate when a child is brutally murdered. Sabrina is supposed to be this force for positive progress in the narrative but she uses her powers to steal the memory from her boyfriend in order to make sure he doesn't make his own decision to leave her when he's clearly not cool with her lifestyle. That's played off as an okay thing to do.<br/><br/>A lot of the stuff in the show only really seems to be there to be edgey and quirky. I watched this show because I liked Riverdale but at least Riverdale, as ridiculous as it is, has focus and character flaws are shown as just that... flaws. I don't like to write reviews normally but I couldn't bear at the thought of other people suffer the same as I did for 10 hours! A person can only take some amount of torture and when there are 10 hours of truckload of torture in a so called series; my TV was fortunate I didn't break it. This is worse than Riverdale! And I thought (before watching this) nothing would be worst than Riverdale. Awful plot, awful cast (what is with that lead girl? Didn't they find anyone except for that creepy emma watson looking girl? She was absolutely horrible the worst of the cast so to say) awful dialogues, I mean everything is awful about this. This should have been shelved even before it was ever thought of. DONOT WATCH OR YOUR 10 HOURS OF LIFE WILL BE LOST IN VAIN! A HORRIBLE HORRIBLE AWFUL SERIES!!!<br/><br/>0/10 Absolutely ruined.... not sure what they were thinking or indeed who they think they are to just change the type of show it is like that. Luckily viewers can watch 1&2 as a stand alone production. Changed my rating from 10 to 5 after watching season 3. And the only reason it's even as high as 5 is because the first season was fantastic. The second was ok. But season 3..what have they done and why!? The entire season was nothing but chaos, death and more of Sabrina being incredibly stupid and making more poor choices than she did in season 1. And did they really have to add all these corny musical numbers?! Just why?? This show went from being dark to some really corny high school show that became difficult to watch! I really hope if there's a season 4, it'll redeem itself and be written more like season 1. Shame on the director and writers for doing this! I like it, the mix between dark themes and campy teenage life is great. The second season is by far superior to the first season, but both are enjoyable. I don't get all the moaning about the show, so much salt for what. I love the twist on religious iconography and references to real world books and grimoires. Overall it is a fun show to watch, especially aunt Hilda, she is hilarious. I have watched the first episode and will not be watching the rest. The inaccuracies about Witchcraft is just the same sort of nonsense seen in all other misinformed movies and TV shows about the topic. It even crosses the line into being highly offensive. I can see past the political agenda of feminism and leftist beliefs; but cannot get past the poor portrayal of the Craft. (Even going so far as to make fun of "Wicca" in using as a name of a club.) On top of that, it is not well-written nor well-acted. Rating it a "1 star" is being generous. I came in to this understanding that this was not supposed to be like the Sabrina sitcom, but I was still excited. How could a dark take on Sabrina go wrong? And we get the fabulous Michelle Gomez? I was all in.
Unfortunately it went downhill and it went downhill fast. 1: The constant camera blur is really annoying.
2: The story is overall boring and all over the place.
3: The politics are unnecessary and her clich√É¬© millennial friends are nauseating.
4: They ruined Salem.
Honestly it belongs in the CW's trash heap of a lineup Yet another failure form Netflix. It's not only boring but it's also packed with feminist propaganda. I guess this what NPC swarms need now days. Somehow I managed to waste 30 minutes on this and that was it for me. This review and rating is based on season 3 . I loved first 2 seasons , it was a pure 10 for me with all dark humor , different approach and l no soap opera melodrama.<br/><br/>I actually started all my talks about Sabrina to people with something like "it is fresh how there is no melodrama , especially after deaths , and other gruesome stuff , it is like another friday for characters and no crying"<br/><br/>Then Season 3 happened and melodrama went ballistic , constantly felt like I am watching Santa Barbara or Supernatural (I loved Supernatural until season ~7-8).<br/><br/>And the musical numbers OH MY GOD THE MUSICAL NUMBERS. I hate them , this show is now glee , when one witch started singing in the woods i thought bambi and squirrels will come and sing along like in some Disney cartoon.<br/><br/>
This show is not for me anymore and I am sad (actually on season release we had a binge group and watched entire season with friends and pizza , we were all very disappointed ). Loved Part 1 & 2, but Part 3 was disappointing to say the least. I wanted all the dark humour or just any humour at all to show up. Did all the writers die and get replaced by Hollywood conformed robots. And for the love of 'Satan' I wish everyone would stop shoving musical numbers into every series! it's off putting and just plain garbage, You can hear the studio had a lot work to do. Also keep the series separate, no one wants see Riverdale. Season 1 was great.
Season 2 was brilliant.
Season 3 is a weak and woke forced diversity extravaganza! Weak on plot, poor antagonists, the best characters given very little to do, musical numbers and reduced to a teen romp. At first the shows interesting visuals and cinematography drew me in, however, the writing is so atrocious it is barely able to call itself anything less than the first draft of the script. It's like they asked a teenage girl what she thinks the original show was about, and went from there. Any creativity is masked by a self-centered protagonist, that lacks any forward thinking whatsoever. Sabrina is by far the most unlikeable main character I have ever seen in a show. She makes the dumbest decisions, which I would be okay with, if it weren't for the fact that there doesn't appear to be any consequences. It's like the show has no clear direction of what it wants to be or where it wants to go. It's almost as if each scene was shot by a different director with a different vision of where the episode was going to go. TERRIBLE. STAY AWAY. Even if you're curious. Teenagers got issues. check. But seriously, writers, is no one at the helm with so much as a modicum of cleverness? Why, dear God, why did you allow the entire freaking season to be hijacked by a young woman with gender identity disorder??? And then THE STEREOTYPICAL JOCKS! Seriously? So now everyone who plays sports is a homophobe? You people are ridiculous! The girl , girl with female genitalia and xx chromosomes couldn't dribble, couldn't shoot, couldn't play to save her life. BUT she just had to be on a boy's basketball team, nonetheless???? What is wrong with you people? I might suggest therapy for all of you projecting your own fears and insecurities onto the rest of us. Why would you choose to lose half your audience with this complete and utter drivel? Move along, nothing to see here. Some things just shouldn't be messed with. If it's worth doing, it's worth doing right. There's nothing magical about this show. The relationships are forced and the story is filled with left wing talking points. We get it Netflix, you hate white men and everything they stand for. I'm sure this show will get renewed, and here's hoping that the writers decide to get off their lazy asses and bring us something a little more original. Ok I enjoy this type of genre but the political slant turned me off immediately. Bullying is wrong in all circumstances. But glorifying hate groups like the Black Panthers? I'll pass. Do not waste your time. Some people believe in the spiritual world. Others dont. But those who like to study and learn about the culture (dark and white side) can see there are a few things on this show that are real. Its a good and interesting show my fear is that teens will try things they see here thinking is all flowers and butterflies like they show it on here. In general, is a good show interesting too they show to much about the dark lord or black magic (i mean thats the show about really). I just wish they show a little bit more about white and good magic. Advice: dont try anything at home. I really enjoyed the original sabrina the teenage witch so I was very excited to see this more darker version of it. Not so Much anymore after seeing the first 4 episodes. Let Me list a few of the things wrong with this show:
-Too much Political Agenda, I want to be entertained by a show, If I wanted to hear bias agenda I can listen to the BBC.
-Not enough Magic, The Original although completely different had more relations to magic whereas this version is more about tennage drama which I find mind-numbing.
-Evil or not? Sabrina in this version can at sometimes be kind and friendly yet she and the spellman family suggests evilness and Devil Worshipping..I'm just confused by it all.
-It needs more Salem!! He played such a big role in the Original yet is not really featured in this reboot.<br/><br/>Really they should of called this show a completely different name as I don't see what connection it has to the Original except the Characters names. I love this show. I love the characters, the gothic themes, the humour, clever dialogue, the sexual innuendo, mystical spell casting etc etc.<br/><br/>But this one was just all over the place. I agree with a previous reviewer that I feel bad for the actors. I think they all do a great job, and gave their performances every effort with a frightening storyline/script. The musical element at the end of Season 2 was fine...because I'm a big opera fan.<br/><br/>But with the subsequent musical scenes... especially with cheerleading - watch 'Bring it on' before attempting something unrealistic and cringe-paged (I also doubt that 'new cheer girls' would get centre stage, I know it's Sabrina, Queen of Hell, but the rest of the school doesn't know that.) I had to warn my partner in advance that there would be some painful singing coming up. If you're going the musical route - do it properly so that it's entertaining to anyone i.e. so the 'non-musical' folk are not silently gagging.<br/><br/>The season's 'drama' was too much. It completely desensitised me when I should have been awed and nervous. When you go too hard too fast, you lose effect i.e. When you keep up with the 'end of the world' 'everyone dies forever' 'the devil isn't all that scary', you lose impact and power over your audience. I was justifiably terrified of 'The Dark Lord' in season 1, this dwindled toward the end of season 2, and was absolutely non-existent in season 3. The new contender for Hell's throne was starting to seem like a plot line worth pursuing from a romance perspective but he just went to dust without any climax or worthy scene. (I predicted he found a better gig midway so the writers just wrapped his character up)<br/><br/>Even Sabrina, the teenager, is completely self-determining and just knowing she can do what she wants, how she wants, just takes away from any realism since there are no rules for her. She does not listen to her Aunties, she angrily chastised them in season 1 (when they had good reason to lie) and made them promise 'no more secret's and all she does Is lie to them and let them find out in the worst ways. And even when it turns to crap, she doesn't apologise or have any awareness of what she is playing with - it's always a defensive 'well, I did it because I had a good reason...' not a remorseful 'ok, I thought it was a good idea but I can see you were right and I had no idea and should never have done it'. Whether on Earth, or in Hell, she just does what she wants and to Hell with the consequences, she'll just cry about it later and try to make it right in her righteous way, forgetting she is the cause of it all.<br/><br/>The academy of unseen arts - wonderful title. But I thought it was a long standing academy, like a smaller Hogwarts, and from the end of season 2 we are left with an average of 10 students. I was underwhelmed by this. The same goes for Hell - you can't tell me after a zillion years you only have a party of 12 hovering around to grumble about a lack of king. And all the other witches summoned in the land equates to... 4 or 5? I know extra faces are expensive, but I'm sure there was enough budget for a few more extras or scenes to make the season look like more than a stage-play amongst extended relatives. The only setting which really nails this is Baxter high, and I was actually surprised enough to comment that there appear to be students in the corridors and it actually looks like a high school. Unfortunately, most of the action happens off School grounds.<br/><br/>Prudence was always a dignified and sharp-witted character. Now she irrationally flips on Ambrose for things beyond his control (and who ironically has more reason to flip on her when she was happy to have him executed knowing he was innocent and 'honourable').<br/><br/>Please, for the love of Satan/Sabrina/Callahan/greenman, revert to the structured ways of season 1, and the same equation every other successful series utilises that guarantees longevity (like CSI, Supernatural, etc etc) - let the characters deal with one problem/theme/issue at a time, per episode (e.g. the episode - Dreams in a witchouse was one of my favourites). The lead's issues can simmer away in the background. It keeps us entertained and keeps us interested. It keeps us coming back for the next dilemma to be solved or disaster to be averted. Save the real disasters for the season finales and deal with them properly.<br/><br/>The 'go two separate ways sabrina' logic makes no sense - they are both still SABRINA. So unless they are planning to switch now and then, it wouldn't work. And where/how/what the hell did the second Sabrina come from the get the jump on Callahan ? I may not have paid enough attention because I'd lost interest.<br/><br/>There is of course so much more to say but I will end my lengthy criticism there. I am only this critical because I love this series and I am terrified that season 3 has destroyed chances for a continuation. I really enjoyed season 1, then came season 2. It remained enjoyable but we could see the premises of what becomes constant in season3-> bad writing. The scenario is all over the place, the characters are introduced in love and hate each other is less than 30min and back again. Tasks are presented as hard and almost impossible and yet solutions are found in the minute and the task resolved without too much difficulties etc etc.<br/><br/>In the end... avoid season 3 and forget about season 4 won't even try it I really enjoyed season 1 and 2 and the beginning of season 3 but the more it went on the weirder it got and not in a good way! It was so all over the place I couldn't keep up and it started to be very confusing. I'm not sure what happened or how season 1 and 2 could be so good with season 3 almost seeming like a different show? Pretty disappointing Its a really good show and I will continue to watch it if it gets renewed but I hate the constant singing. They're good enough singers but it's so irrelevant even when they try to make it relevant and I just dont understand why the writers feel the need to keep forcing it in. It's a show about satanic witches, it makes no sense.
Overall, great show just that one thing makes it cringe at times. I was very skeptical at first, as I'm sure most were... but watching it (despite the overly done "hail satan" of the whole thing) Kiernan does an absolutely amazing job with the character. Truly it is art come to life which is hard to come by, so here's hoping that Netflix keeps this one going for some time In among the panto-level campness and eye-roll inducing tweeny romance, there were some decent horror moments and outstandingly creepy production design in season 1 so I gave it the benefit of the doubt.<br/><br/>Season 2 caused me to bail a few episodes in. It was getting even sillier and the diversty box ticking suppporting cast stories were even more hamfistedly written and crowbarred into the main narrative. Should make it clear that I am exactly the type of liberal those characters should appeal to, but the writing around them is just so bad that they feel like an excessively obvious attempt to trumpet the shows progressive cred to the detriment of the series. Part one was watchable and enjoyable. Part 2... whyyyyyy? The writing was lazy, the plot was thin, and didn't actually go anywhere in terms of forwarding the narrative until the final three episodes.<br/><br/>If you're a massive fan of the Melissa Joan Hart series, you're probably not going to like this at all. I don't even know what to say... this was too much all over the place.. they had so much to work with but fell flat on it all. Update: Part 2 of the first season gets off to an awful start. The initial episode is so obnoxious and ham-handed in the social justice department that it's borderline unwatchable. The episode reminded me of a high school film project because the writing on gender identity is stilted beyond belief. -2 on the score.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if the writers on this series stopped to think which message they wanted to convey about Sabrina. Is she kind? Seems to be. Yet she shows no shock at all when the topic of murdering someone is raised. Sabrina is all gung-ho about girl power and standing up for other people, but she is part of a Satanist cult of witches. How can we take her character seriously when she seems to ignore all the dark business going on within her own family? And hello, Satan? Football players are the scum of the Earth, but Satan is nothing to worry about in this show. Bizarre.<br/><br/>PS: the oily blur camera effects are really annoying. Beautiful production and set. The ambiance feels a bit like The Craft and I absolutely love Michelle Gomez. She is such a fantastic and creative actor. HOWEVER... The new Sabrina is a very bad representation of witches. This feels like outdated Christian fiction to me and not giving representation to actual witches or Wicca, Voodoo, or Santeria practitioners (etc) is very damaging. There ARE Christian witches and probably Satanic witches as well, but they are few and far between. I know this show is fiction, but it is bringing back a terrible stereotype. It is not healthy. Why not have a show about Satanists if you want to do that? Its just weird to keep confusing Christianity with modern day witchcraft . There are tons of marginalized philosophies and religions to delve into, instead of calling them all "Salem" witches. I'd suggest waiting a few weeks before watching a newly released Netflix movie or series that's been rated unnaturally high, i.e. Rotten Tomatoes 100%. The reviews often spike the first day, then slowly decrease over time, when eventually you'll start seeing the reviews settle to be more accurate. Granted I haven't finished the very last episode, but if that last episode is fantastical, I didn't find it worth my time. First episode contains a bit of blatant leftist propaganda, but that is more of an annoyance than a problem. Male characters are boring, shallow stereotypes. Female characters are morally rudderless, though a few have room to grow. Looks like a setup for silly people doing silly things and not getting called on it because destiny, or patriarchy, or whatever.<br/><br/>Skip. I am obviously not the target audience. I'm having trouble conceiving who is... Do intersectional feminists like Satan-worship and cannibalism, now? If so, did they always, because that would actually explain a lot. (Just poking fun. I know you guys, like most people, are only evil by accident.)<br/><br/>If you can tolerate teenage drama and 90s lingo, go watch Buffy instead. It's the first time I'm writing a review but I just don't want people to waste time on this boring, satan worshipping series. Casting is bad, acting is bad, blurry camera is annoying. And it's literally too dark. Picture is extremely dark and hard on the eyes. And Salem who doesn't talk???
There's also too much propaganda. They decided to mix everything in one show - black power, feminists, transgenders etc. Why always try to suit the minority?
I wouldn't show this to anyone under 18 as the show has some disturbing satanic scenes.
If you like dark stuff it's better to watch the Haunting of hill house. Don't waste your time on this one I thought she will fight the satan in the end but it seems they will benefit from this as much as possible and make several seasons . Ok what an old guy would be doing watching a show focused on teenagers ?<br/><br/>Nothing I was just watching this to have something to listen before sleep.<br/><br/>All of the sudden the typical steriotypes arises and the Political propaganda either !!<br/><br/>And that was the reason that scaried me !! It is a show supposed to be watched by teenagers !!<br/><br/>It is Gramscianism at it s most !!<br/><br/>It is a pity because it has everything to be a very good terror show for teens. The premise of this show is simple: anyone who is not a white male is oppressed by society so they must turn on witchcraft and sell themselves to the Devil to defeat the evil white pathriarchy. It doesn't make any sense? Of course it doesn't. Neither does it make any sense that someone that it's clearly a human male goes around saying "I don't belong to any sex". Of course you do. Gender is a biological fact, wheter you like it or not. This show perpetuate the extreme left-wing idea that white males are ruthless evil dictators that force women and "minorities" to leave in fear and they must use violence to destroy their oppression and be cheered as heroes for that. It's a cultural suicide. What's even worse is looking at all these praising reviews. Kids of my generations are really brainwashed. Incredible show. Casting, acting, script, cinematography are all fantastic.<br/><br/>The problem is, as soon as you try to be inclusive these days all the snowflakes come out of the woodwork to call it "leftist".<br/><br/>Compassion and tolerance and understanding... These are not political ideas they're emotions. Stop making it about politics and admit you're intolerant of people who aren't like you (that's called prejudice by the way).<br/><br/>I love this show for many reasons, but the most important reason is it's inclusiveness. There is no "normal". We're all different and that's what makes this world so awesome.<br/><br/>10 out of 10 for sure. While there are definitely valid complaints about all the SJW and political agenda, those things were mostly heavy-handed early on the first 2 or 3 episodes. Soon afterwards, the writers really dialed down those annoyances and dove into juicy storytelling and some interesting characterizations. In particular the witch/warlock plots are the most fascinating. The high school stuff is rather meh, although the friends finally got more watchable as the season progressed. A big complaint I have about the series is the main character Sabrina herself. I find her too loud, OP, and obnoxious. The actress' voice is like nails on a chalkboard at times. When I saw the promo and the part "I AM SABRINA SPELLMAN AND I WILL..." came up, I cringed hard and the show hadn't even started yet.<br/><br/>And there's too much Harry Potter going on with her where she's the "chosen one". Why is a half-witch, someone not even fully powered, the chosen one? Shouldn't the other full witches have more power than her? I get Sabrina is the star, but there never feel like there are any stakes or obstacles with her. Everyone is so centered on her and circle her to the point that I'm like "why this person"? She repeatedly does dumb stuff ignoring her family's warnings and makes situations even worse than they need to be. Also, the writers really overdo it on Sabrina's appeal. She's very dour and overbearing to the point where I don't get why so many people flock to her other than she's the star. And I barely buy her as a 16-year old. She could pass for freaking 13 or 14! So it's jarring when I see 2 guys like Harvey and Nick this attracted to her.<br/><br/>There ARE some really strong characters in Miss Wardwell, Zelda, Hilda, Ambrose, Prudence, and Blackwood, but they are all on the witch side of things. The human teen subplots need a ton of work, especially since the show seems hellbent on including the friends more and more into the witch subplots, either unknowingly or not. Roz has potential, but gender-challenged Susie character is kind of just there and the teen romance with Harvey is rather boring. Could have been a cool urban/horror fantasy series, but it was made choke full with far left and liberal ideology and lies without providing a different point of view. I had high hopes for this show, but sorely disappointed about 20 minutes. Political rhetoric runs rank where it doesn't even fit in the story. The acting is sub par. The "good girl" that is totally okay with Satan but wants girl power makes no sense. The blurry ring camera effects are annoying, etc. Good idea, poor execution and plot. Oh my, one of the worst things I have ever seen. It was like I was bewitch, but not in a good way. I can't believe what I was watching, it was like a blur. No literally it was blurry the whole time. I couldn't tell if it was for adults or kid I don't think it could tell if it was for adults or for kids. How do you use all the same name and not expect people to compare it to the fun loving TV show Sabrina the Teen Aged Witch. It was like if you put One Tree Hill on the set of Pans Labyrinth. The cheesy lines, the drama and the weird aunts. It was also weirdly political, anyone that says it wasn't is under a spell. Not even 30 minutes in and we are already railing against the patriarchy and crying about mistreatment of transgenders. I just can't wait to see what more feminist left wing talking points the show crams down my throat before the end of episode 1. Why can't tv and movies just be for entertainment anymore? Why does everything have to turn into a virtue signaling moral preachfest?<br/><br/>I honestly should have learned my lesson, because I initially unsubbed from Netflix because I got bored of every show just being a thinly veiled mouth piece for the far left that was 80% ramming their "message" down people's throats and only about 20% show. Well I resubbed to see this show and it's just the same old stuff. Sigh. A show along these lines has the potential to be good if anyone cared to just focus on making an interesting story. This series has a bland, boring and very predictive plot. All the characters are one dimensional without any form of backstory and the acting is all over the place. The best part (for all the wrong reasons is its wokeness)<br/><br/>I don't know about anyone else, but whenever I see this kind of woke agenda forced into my movies or series I just laugh them off. That's because it adds absolutely nothing to the series and benefits no one excepts the holier than though writers who want just feel good about themselves. The bullies, racists, misogynists etc. etc. will not magically change their behavior because some woke fictional series is preaching to them. We the normal audience (who I suspect most are decent men) will be the ones who have to put up with a bad series that has sacrificed plot, character development and acting for a forced woke agenda, when we just want an entertaining series.<br/><br/>My advice please stay away from this bad series. You do not get the escapism from the real world that you want in this series. That's because all essentials that make up a good series has been put aside for a force woke agenda littered throughout the entire series. I tried my best to finish the series (the first season, at least) and I made it the majority of the way. But it just hurt too much to keep going.<br/><br/>The main story of Sabrina, concerning Sabrina herself and the world of witchery is very interesting (it's why I read the comic that this was based on so long ago). Sabrina's friends though? I hated their side plots, all of them (except for some of Harvey's, his were okay). Both Rosalind and Susie's stories are horribly forced and are constantly shoved in your face for the sake of being PC and 'inclusive', and I say this as a gay woman. These side plots just aren't written well at all, and it gets my nerves, not to mention the less than stellar acting (to that, I am sure that these kids can act, they're good...sometimes. I think it can partially be blamed by the script), which makes it harder for me to get through. I know some people that can watch shows that are cheesy (which, Sabrina's storyline is quite cheesy, but I was able to bear it because the writing in that section of the show isn't as forced), or 'guilty pleasure' shows. I suppose I don't have that much of a tolerance for them. But, in my opinion, these side plots aren't handled well, are forced, and are badly written. They made me dislike watching the show so much. I read the comics, I loved the comics. The comics are dark and gritty and deep. I haven't read anything since the 80's that really gripped me the way those comics did. So naturally I was extremely excited when I saw this up for grabs on Netflix. Unfortunately Sabrina decided it wanted to be propaganda instead of story. I'm not right wing, or a "Trump supporter". But this show skipped right over what it was supposed to be to push a political narrative. That can work for somethings but not this. They should have used the comics for their script. They should have kept out of the politics this time because it ruins the ambience of the show and pollutes the narrative. If I wanted to tune into the 6 o'clock news that's what I would have done. The only thing scary about this is the Orwellian levels of disregard it shows for art. It gets on my nerves when people project ehir political opinions on me. Season 1 and 2 were fantastic, season 3 makes me feel like I'm watching a cringe worthy American High-school drama, disappointment! The show is at it's core amazing in every way.<br/><br/>From the cast, the acting, the scenery , the feeling. It's s treat.<br/><br/>
The Vocal minority that has bombed the reviews with 1/10s , are mostly people that don't enjoy the Human sidekicks of sabrina (which is an acceptable argument although it doesn't bother me)<br/><br/>or people who are deeply offended by the choice of the show to support trans people, as well as for the (sometimes obnoxious) "Men bad, women good and victims" direction that this shows follows.<br/><br/>Obviously I don't agree with it, obviously I cringe when there is too much of it, but for me it doesn't ruin the show.<br/><br/>Now giving it 1/10 for that is "fine" (no it's not by you are mad so whatever) but getting triggered by that and then say things like @@@@bad acting , no story, sh((t ugly actors, that just makes you look pathetic. This show started out okay but quickly turned to garbage. There is no sense of real danger or even a sense of a good plot line. Everything done is very questionable and the writing is lazy to the point that they just named everything unholy or something normal but with an 'un'. I downloaded episodes to watch at work while it was dead so I can have something to do and this made me want to watch paint dry. I love the horror take on original Sabrina show. Plenty of dark humor to enjoy also. Great plots. However I stopped at episode 8 as I couldn't stand the main character Sabrina. She grew incredibly annoying the further you got into the series. A complete ignorant and stupid brat. The actress who plays her was also mediocre. She had the same expression the entire series. Unable to portray complicated feelings of the character. Made me wanna whack her in the heads every time I saw her face and send her back to her school talent show. Her acting career should have stopped there. Sophomore slumps are a funny thing, aren't they? As a reviewer, they're equal parts disheartening, disorienting, and frustrating. Especially when you enjoyed the first season. "We were rooting for you! We were all rooting for you!" the tiny Tyra Banks in your head screams as you watch something take all its worst aspects and double down on them. Unfortunately, that's exactly what The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina has done in Part 2.
Netlfix's witchy tale from Riverdale creator Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, helmer of the entirety of TV's Archie Comics universe, gained a lot of positive attention in its first season, mainly thanks to its subversive darkness and schmear of camp. It walked certain sensitive storylines fairly well, and truly, who can say no to Lucy Davis, Miranda Otto, and Michelle Gomez delivering, well, anything? But what felt mostly good in Season 1 becomes far less so in its second half, with hamfisted plotting and eye-roll-inducing dialogue-to say nothing of how it all just plain drags. There are many reasons why this might be, despite a clear attempt on everyone's part to do their best.<br/><br/>The episodes pick up right where we left off at the end of Part 1 (ignoring that nothingburger Christmas special), with Sabrina (Kiernan Shipka) trying to take down the Dark Lord/Lucifer/The Devil/Satan/whatever you want to call him, from inside the Church of Night. It - surprise, surprise - does not go particularly well. Her power and popularity are increasing, as is the subsequent ire she's drawing from Father Blackwood (Richard Coyle), soon-to-be husband to her Aunt Zelda (Otto), and the Weird Sisters. Also, her mortal friends have really complicated, mostly negative, feelings towards her.
All the while, Mrs. Wardell/Lilith (Gomez) cautiously continues do His bidding, with predictably increasing skepticism as the story wears on. Oh yes and sometimes Ambrose (Chance Perdomo) and Aunt Hilda (Davis) are there, too. What results is a Messiah Prophecy narrative, played out in a battle against the subjugation of the women in the coven. The show continues to subvert, yes, but what was once playing at a 12 has now been cranked up to a 57. It's downright American Horror Story-esque, and that is not a compliment. Everything in the Church of Night is an upending of a Christian tradition, like "the Anti-Pope," plus a lot of shirtless men, a hallmark of all Archie Comics TV dudes.
If you're like me and loved Season 1 of Riverdale but did not like Season 2, you may end up feeling the same way about the second half of Sabrina, as many of their core issues are the same. The difference between being campy and corny (the former being a delight), is one that the show fails to discern. Sabrina manages to both be and do too much, even as its main star consistently gives us not enough. The whole series plays as if everyone involved is absolutely exhausted and out of ideas or energy to give to a ludicrous and in-needing-of-constant-energy show. The first five episodes are a painful, ultimately pointless slog.<br/><br/>The final three episodes certainly kick things into high gear, and the story actually becomes a bit more engaging and interesting to get into. But the uphill battle it takes to get there is simply not worth the pay-off, no matter how wild the storytelling gets. The show is beautiful to look at, Otto, Davis, and Gomez (who is so criminally ill-utilized in this set of episodes I'd like to make a citizen's arrest of Aguirre-Sacasa myself) are always going to be captivating, fun, and engaging to watch, no matter the writer. None of that, however, makes up for the fact that virtually nothing feels emotionally satisfying or earned, to a cringe-inducing degree. Does this show really know what it is trying, or wants, to be?
This is particularly evident in the handling of Lachlan Watson's transitioning Susie - now Theo - Putnam, one of Sabrina's mortal friends. To be clear: the non-binary Watson is a capable and charming actor, and I look forward to seeing what they do in the future, but Theo's story isn't given the space or respect it deserves, resulting in something that feels brushed-over at best and offensive and exploitative at its worst. And it's not because Theo is given some sort of tragic storyline (nobody needs that): it's because Theo just doesn't feel like a character the writers care about; he feels like a prop. The same is true of Roz (Jaz Sinclair) and her blindness and Cunning, but at least she has a bit more agency and an arc - probably because she's now dating Harvey, which invites more comment than I care to even get started on.
Sabrina's second installment is a frustratingly bizarre turn, falling into seemingly every potential (but avoidable) trap it set for itself in Part 1. It is an overwrought and tortured follow-up to a mostly enjoyable first season. It's as if the writers sat down, decided on the ending, wrote their final three episodes first, and then puzzled together some semblance of a beginning and hoped that all would be forgiven. Sure, there is a hint of promise in how the series plainly spells out its plans for a Part 3, but they're going to have to work really, really hard to make it seem worth it.<br/><br/>Bottom line? Chilling Adventures of Sabrina Part 2 is a true disappointment. Doubling down on bad choices, weird plotting, and cringeworthy dialogue and circumstances, not even the series' true heroes - Michelle Gomez, Miranda Otto, and Lucy Davis - can save it from itself. Sabrina's tired storytelling and Riverdale-esque Hot Teen tropes fall incredibly flat in an attempt to tell a Witchy Girl Power Story that would have felt more at home in 1996. Just... please go watch The Magicians instead. Its not scary, its not interesting and comes out pretty bland. The acting is not particularly great. Sabrina herself seems confused at times just like the show. Overall, its a show thats just not gripping enough especially after netflix delivered a tremendous 'Haunting of Hill House' This is the third show of mine I have dropped cause the writers or who ever in charged thought it would be brilliant to add a glee theme musical to their show. E.G. Riverdalw, Big Mouth. They ruined Sabrina with this high school musical wanna be third season. The dark goth show no longer exists and for that reason Im out. But instead the writers, who I assume are college liberals with degrees in gender studies, chose to be preachy about their left wing ideology to the extent that it detracted from the actual plot and diminished the enjoyment for anyone who is not a fellow college liberal...propaganda poisoned this show. Will no longer watch. Even if they removed the politics, Sabrina is a Mary Sue, interesting characters are never developed, interesting storylines are never explored (probably to give room for political ones), and many plots just disappear without explanation. Great potential wasted by arrogant writers. A genuine talent like Shipka should have been given a far better script and basis for a series. This is neither one thing not another - not funny or scary. The political messages are there - we have women's rights, black power, transgenderism, and feminism. Oh, dear! Was this at the instruction of Netflix? Was it insisted, and imposed upon the writers? It's tiresome in the extreme. It only helped detract from the storyline - but there isn't one, really. I shan't be watching this dross anymore, Netflix, not because of its absurd and puerile social justice promotions, but because it is poor entertainment and doesn't warrant me spending my time putting up with it. The continuity is laughable - almost on a par with 'Friends', and they saw fit to give the attractive Ms Shipka an awful lot of make-up, when she is so naturally fresh-faced. Overall then, just plain poor stuff. There are tv shows that encourage deep thought; there are shows that, if nothing else, entertain viewers; and then there is The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, which does neither. Overt propaganda even to the inattentive watcher. I promise you, the only spell Sabrina is casting is the one that will make you choose another series. I mean, I've seen worst but I prefer (or did) Riverdale. Nothing really happens and it's not well made to be honest. So no season 2 for me thank you very much. We get enough politics through social media, I want to watch something and enjoy it. I wish there was a little bit more comedy, like a horror mixed comedy, maybe? This just isn't what I really expected. We need to have a series that is just based off of the original 90s Sabrina the Teenage which, that would be awesome. Oh, and, Salem the cat doesn't even talk and he was like 80% the whole show in the 90s!! Plus he was like the only evil-comedic thing that would have been great to have in this series to make it a little lighter. Comon people lets make things that are good to watch. If you're into lame teen dramas this one is for you!. Just another cry wah, wah, wah I don't know what to do to with my choices because I have a teenage boyfriend crisis-story line. If the villains in the series has any sort of a brain capacity, there wouldn't be a show to make and would save people a lot of time vs. wasting on a complete cringe fest I started the first episode, and it felt okay. Blurry motions are a pain, but that's something I can live with. Acting is overall not too bad. I was ready to get cozy in bed and watch the full season this weekend. Sabrina's group of friends is .. diverse, but I felt it wasn't pushed. Boy was I wrong ! After the 20 minutes mark, here comes talks about White Supremacy, patriarchy, feminism and all of that. You have a white transgender being bullied by obvious bullies, but suddenly it turns out it's because of the White Patriarchy. You have one talking about "daughters of Black Panthers", as if the Black Panthers were a nice band of black boy scouts or something. I mean.. Come on ! Can we, for once, stop with all of this ? Politics are important, and should be discussed. Just not in TV shows, this has to stop. It doesn't feel as forced as in Charmed, but it's definitely there. I want my normal shows without an agenda being pushed down my throat every single second I was excited for this show. But after watching it, I've realized it's complete social justice propaganda. Come on, are you trying to preach to us that "white patriarchy is bad" (and basically any current issue that mad liberals yap about today) but being a witch for Satan is okay....just because you're a woman? Please.<br/><br/>They should have focused on trying to make the show entertaining rather than trying to spread social justice B.S. Because truly, even without the social justice elements, this show would still be terrible. The acting is wooden, and you just don't care for any of the characters, and want them to die quickly so the show would be done with, and you get on with your life. The plot is very thin and predictable. You couldn't care less where the story goes or how it ends.<br/><br/>I really wish I hadn't watched this. If you haven't, I suggest you don't. Go re-watch the great Netflix originals like Daredevil S1-3 or Narcos. I was so looking forward to this. I love darker stuff and the show seemed to have plenty of it. Now, someone forgot to tell the writers that you can make a strong female lead without constant stream of man hating. Obviously this show does not care about what men in any way. It wasnt 30 min in and the man bashing was in full swing. This show would have been amazing without actively trying to alienate half of its potential audience. Bad writing at its very best. The old kids series was better and at the very least watchable. As a practicing pagan/witch I was first taken aback when I started watching this series, but I gave it a chance with the understanding that this show truly stand on its own. It is not meant to be historically accurate to witchcraft. Honestly it takes jabs at all faiths. The series producers have said that this is a purely fictional representation of witches and/or their rituals. Yes there is common symbology and elements, but that helps create a believable world. Just think of this as a parallel world and pay attention to the social injustices that are more prevalent in our world. Such as the demeaning treatment and subgagation of women. I actually read some other pagans opinions on the series and they pointed out how this makes fun of Catholics more than anything. So before you completely dismiss the series, consider giving bit a chance and realize it is a work of fiction. How is it if based in the 1960s Harvey has a cell phone? Oops blooper? I miss the lightness and fun like Salem the cat.
The old Sabrina never mentioned the dark lord or satan. This is too dark for me. To bad. What is it with these remakes that lose the lightheartedness of their originals in favor of preachy feminist messaging?<br/><br/>I love shows with strong female leads (or supporting characters, for that matter), but if done correctly, these characters can stand on their own feet without having to be "justified" through explicit feminist sermonizing. This approach of spelling it all out just in case the viewing audience is too stupid to get it from context is rather insulting, and offensively lacking in subtlety.<br/><br/>So, why not save what is essentially a good script by cutting out the heavy-handed lecturing? If that were done, the show would be well worth watching for simple entertainment value, but on its current trajectory it is headed for the closest dung-heap. This show does a lot of things right, with great cinematography and very crisp visuals full of popping colors and dark hues. But oh man, the continuity errors and extreme reliance on bad CG. Computer generated blood already looks bad compared to practical. But when you have horrible continuity errors where big puddles and splatters of blood are disappearing, re-appearing, and completely changing shape between shots, it looks terrible. There's so many continuity errors that I have no idea how they could have possibly gotten by. All of the practical effects look fantastic, so I don't know why they chose to do this cartoonish looking CG instead, that scarecrow monster looked like it came straight out of Luigis Mansion. I was curious about this remake, so I decided to watch the first two episodes. I honestly did not like it one bit, but I will finish the season. And I do not intend to watch next season. The dark theme is well done, but I do not appreciate it much (I prefer a thousand times Penny Dreadful) especially putting The Lord of darkness and cannibalistic witches in a series for adolescents. Cinematography is good, but the excess of Blur in the images leaves something to be desired. Some CGI were well done others not so much. The script is not one of the worst, but his writing full of political propaganda draw focus on the plot. About the characters, well Sabrina is acceptable at times, in others it seems silly and too idealistic for my liking. Since when a young girl changes the world, we have several books and films where they are the saviors of the motherland. Do not overdo their attributes by turning Sabrina into a Mary Sue as Rey and others. The secondary characters sound false, pretentious, mere caricatures that like to be oppressed and oppressive victims of society. For God's sake stop putting this on every show. This trend is getting unbearable ... and look I'm a Brazilian Afro. A little diversity is not bad, but when it is used in the wrong way forcing the barred and imposing. It stops being entertainment and happens to be political agenda. The only thing I loved about this show was the opening and the family of Sabrina, both the aunts and the cousin conquered me. The rest I want to forget. Unlike the other low reviewers, I didn't find the agenda-pushing nature of the show grating- storytelling media has always had some moral, some agenda.
What I didn't like was the misery, the satanic elements (surely we've moved away from witches as agents of Satan by now?), the depressing, dark sets, the heavily stylised and not very good cinematography- a lot of literally dark shots where it's hard to make out details, a weird tilt shift which is almost like vaseline smeared around the edges of the lens- everything except the very centre is blurry and it's very jarring and immersion-breaking.<br/><br/>Performances and direction were decent enough, dialogue wasn't terrible despite the writing being shaky, but the concept- which I guess is based on a particular recent comic series- is just not for me, and as mentioned, the dreary sets, blurry or dark shots- I can't see myself sticking with this. Also, I was pretty horrified to see fully nude shots of a 15 year old character. I only watched the pilot, but the glorification/glamourising and general promotion of satan worship- the literal evil devil satan, and the 'path of darkness'- made me extremely uncomfortable, and I watched the show Lucifer avidly!<br/><br/>I guess the best you can say about this show is that it's gone some way to change the title/clarify its direction so people aren't misled into thinking this is a remake of the fun, but very dated, teen sitcom. Still- I definitely preferred when teen entertainment was a fun distraction from the realities of life, and not a gritty mirror of misery! I'm really surprised by the negative feedback on this show. I was skeptical at first to watch it, since I grew up watching the Sabrina sitcom. However, halfway through the first episode I was hooked! I think everything about this show from the script to the cast is flawless. I was so excited for season 2 and it did not disappoint at all! Very excited to see the upcoming seasons and I really hope Netflix does not cancel this show anytime soon. The idea was nice but I just found Sabrina to be less of a powerful woman and more of a snobby brat. I appreciate them trying to create a more powerful woman role, but the actress that played Sabrina did it poorly and just made everything annoying. If it weren't for the other characters I probably wouldn't have continued watching. It was bearable to watch when nothing else sounded good/bored. Every movie/TV series has a plot that you have to believe real just in order to go with the story, where most fail is to follow that plot properly. Most TV series I've seen fall flat on their faces within minutes and that ruins the whole point of watching TV for relaxation. You would see characters say things or do actions that make no sense whatsoever no matter how twisted the plot is.<br/><br/>Thankfully, "Chilling Adventures of Sabrina" makes an excellent job of following its plot and that basically is enough for me to rate it higher than any average show. However there are certain other problems that I find worrisome, not for this series in particular but for media in general. Tiny spoilers that don't reveal anything story wise follow.<br/><br/>These past few years, almost every single movie/TV series I've seen has shown me gay/lesbian characters, characters trying to win me over by saying "You think that because I'm black?", characters trying to tell me its okay and that I can be whoever I want and be with whoever I want. Guys, I get that stuff, the first few times I understood that as reference to popular movements going on at the time, but now it really feels like such characters are forced to include rather than using whats needed. Is our society in general so much infused with a sense of teaching people about #BlackLivesMatter that we have to include them in every single show? Is LGBT community or heck, even vegitarians so common that we have to have characters in every movie literally show people that they belong to certain community or prefer certain diet? I'm not really against that, but going out of your plot just to show them doesn't do your movie any justice.<br/><br/>Why don't we have people saying in movies "I can eat anything" or "I am a straight person". Because that is pointless. I watch TV to relax, not to drag myself back into social mess. Why would a witch have to deal with a friend who is vegetarian? She shouldn't care about that. Please stop forcing things into media. Let media incorporate them naturally. At this point such tactics only make it worse for the people enjoying the movie. I've only seen a handful where a vegetarian or LGBT person has been portrayed without looking like it was forced in, sadly this is my only gripe with this show. I was really interested in this show. I liked the original sitcom and I knew they were going in a darker less kid friendly direction with this installment which is perfect for this time of year. I watched the pilot to see what would be in store for me. I'm sorry to say that while the story and atmosphere are engaging, Netflix has once again decided to inject social commentary into another of their shows. Not 30 minutes into episode one we have a black character mentioning how she tried to get a Black Panther club started at their high school and that the "white patriarchy" needed to be taken down. This is met with cheers from our protagonist Sabrina who *ahem* happens to be white. Christ. Is it too much to ask to just have an entertaining show with interesting characters that don't spout left wing talking points, or any political talking points for that matter. That of course is rhetorical because I already know the answer. I guess this is why older shows and movies are better because we could just be entertained without being preached to. It's just soooooo boring. Honestly, the inciting incidents are poor, the actors come across like they believe the script is terrible (which it is).<br/><br/>Obviously Netflix wanted to try and stretch the Archie Comics success of Riverdale out. And the whole evil patriarchy sub-plot - give me a break. I think this series actually made me really angry. God this was fun to watch! Solid cast, engaging plot and compelling visuals. This "remake" is certainly nothing like the light sitcom, its dark and its absolutely unforgiving.<br/><br/>To those that are reading reviews deciding whether to go ahead and watch this series. It should be noted that a large number of the negative views are based on the overly political nature of the first two episodes in the show. I won't deny the political side of the narrative is prevalent in both these episodes but beyond that it retains its head exactly where it should be - in the fantasy of this witching world. Those reviewers who have come to suggest this is a propaganda machine would care to watch the third episode and beyond before making their criticism.<br/><br/>If you enjoy the concept of witches, find it refreshing to see a satanic cult cast in a nonchalant non taboo light and would like to see a main character who is genuinely complex and not just a "good witch", then I recommend you would give at least the first 3 episodes ago.<br/><br/>This was so easy to watch and a perfect treat for Halloween. Excited to see what is in store for the series! Loved season 1 and 2, but season 3 doesn't have any of the same creepy atmosphere. I hate the fact they've turned this into a musical.....i'm out Couldn't make it through the first episode as about half of the scenes had some pretty extreme blurring on them. Too uncomfortable to watch and when I felt my eyes were getting strained I just gave up. Flicked through the next few episodes and found they were the same. Way over the top on the blurring effects in about half of the scenes such that I cannot comfortably watch it.<br/><br/>Don't think I am missing out though anyway. Seems like they've just tried to turn Sabrina into yet another Twilight-esque, pseudo-dark show for teens.<br/><br/>I was bored from the outset and disliked all the characters immediately. Starting it off with her already knowing that she was a witch seems like a mistake to me and not a great sign that they have confidence in the show going forward. In the original series it was fun watching as she learnt about her new found powers, likewise with the character development in something like Buffy but that takes time and a confidence that the audience aren't going to give up before you get to that point. Skipping all that and just jumping right into it is kind of dull. Oh and they replaced the best character, Salem, with just some random guy. Sure Salem was very much a comic relief sidekick sort of character but he also had a dark backstory which they easily could have still used. Last night I saw half of the first season of the new "Sabrina" and, frankly, I do not like it. I did not read the comic book, so I do not know the extent to which the original material is respected, but if you were expecting a remake of the '90s series, you'll be disappointed, because this has nothing to do with it except for a few names. The '90s series was a sitcom, a typical high school comedy with a witch in the main role and a talking cat, whose remarks were by far the best thing on the show. "Chilling Adventures of Sabrina" is a dark fantasy-drama that deals with racism, feminism, religion and coming-of-age topics in, in my opinion, an insipid way. Personally, I prefer dealing with these topics through sarcasm and quality humor, but I have nothing against serious approach either. The trouble is that the new "Sabrina" is not witty. It pretends to a serious approach to these topics, but packed into pretty frivolous fantasy series, which simply doesn't work. The series is not serious enough to experience it as a drama, it's not dark or scary enough for horror, and it's not enough over-the-top to fall under so-bad-it's good type of show. As I watched the first five episodes, all the time I had a d√©j√†-vu feeling, and too often I recognized situations, cadres, details, and even entire scenes from various movies and series. The question arises whether the authors are so unimaginative that they had to copy what is already seen, or their intention was to make the series a homage to the classics they value. Whatever it is, I think they overdid it. Further, I did not like the fact that witches are shown as Satanists and cannibals. I have always looked upon witches as beings in harmony with nature, who have a free choice of whether to use magic for good or for evil, whereas here they are shown as a cult that gets its powers directly from the Devil in exchange for an unconditional surrender to satanism. But most of all I was disappointed by the cat, Salem. His character being terribly neglected is explained by the fact that the main actress is allergic to cats, but there's no excuse for him not being able to speak. On the technical side, the series is well done, and the only thing I resent is a really irritating blurring of the background, the purpose of which I really do not understand.<br/><br/>By both the story and production, "Chilling Adventures of Sabrina" reminds me of the over-the-top tongue-in-cheek series "Scream Queens" and "Ash vs Evil Dead", but it's not nearly as good. Try to imagine any of these two shows trying to be serious and you'll understand why I do not like the new "Sabrina".<br/><br/>6,5/10 This is one of the worst shows I've ever seen
How to ruin perfectly cool show and make it full of political propaganda-that is this tv show
It is not about magic, it is full of PC Agenda stupidity, and there is no story
So, if you wanna see how to ruin tv show and make it bad, watch this and laugh
Is it so hard to make cool tv show without AGENDA down our throats...We don't want to be brainwashed, just to have fun Love that show!!
I can't wait for part 4!
We need more!!
Please make part 5 and 6! That prince of hell tried so hard to talk that way,.. it was cringe... I had chills lol I do like this series, the world building is excellent, the writing is excellent and the acting is magnificent.<br/><br/>That said, for a good part of the third season I fervently wanted to reach through the screen and murder Sabrina.<br/><br/>Her character shares a trait that annoys me with The Flash also, the character's fervent need to fix everything personally and in Sabrina's case sometimes things which aren't broken - just not to her liking.<br/><br/>It was particularly bad in series 3 of Sabrina but that is the only thing I have to say against this show. I'm very much looking forward to series 4.<br/><br/>Oh and special mention forTati Gabrielle as Prudence, she and her character are truly magnificent and have probably had the best character development arc in the series. I liked season 1 and 2 and they had so much potential to be different from other teen shows. Now with season 3... It has turned into Riverdale. Weird music numbers, cheer and just lazy writing. It is so sad to see a show like this dig its own grave It's literally the worst season sabrina is the queen of hell and besides that she is the most powerful witch among all of them and she doesn't use her powers when king herodes attacks her and besides many other events that happened in this season you should work harder if you're gonna make a new season... I love Sabrina and was so excited for this show. The first two seasons I loved although it could get a little too political at times. I was looking forward to season 3 and it retroactively ruined the first two seasons. Seasons I watched probably over 10 times if I'm honest. The 5+ musical numbers and the utter disrespect for Tricky by RunDMC not only once, but twice, made me cringe so hard. The writing was terrible and the show somehow morphed into Riverdale pt. 2. Why? Why would Netflix do this to us? In season 1 & 2 the spellman witches are strong and in season 3 they're suddenly basically powerless? Hilda is being "cursed" and she ignores it? Also she Kills her fiance and isn't sad or anything? Calliban is just annoying as hell, quite literally. Harvey decides to attack the pagans, although they turned his girlfriend to stone? Ross ignores that she Sees Horns on that dude in the Carnival?
Did all the characters lose their minds?
I hope this will change. This season was disappointing regarding the story. Takes itself too seriously for how fun it wants to be. Drags on with too much drama and not enough stakes. I'm tired of the one dimensional adults and the backstabbing nature of almost every youth. It bores over time. I liked the first season. Oked, the second and by the third I found I simply didn't care anymore. Why did they have to kill all the nice dark chills this show had in part 3? How did they even suppose it'll be a good thing to kill what the show was and was loved by us the audience for and turn it into some cheesy teen pop musical instead? I see no logic in ruining something that was just right and had a fan base and turn it into something very different by adding these repulsive scenes that were almost never in the previous two parts and totally changing the feel of the show. I'm disappointed, I loved the previous parts, but now since part 3's 2nd episode I am not even sure if I want to continue watching it, too much cringe. It seems like this cheesy teen singing stuff just killed it for me. Thanks a lot for ruining yet another good series that had great potential. Part 1 was really good. Part 2 was ok. Two episodes into Part 2 and I'm out. What started out with fun characters has gone to taking itself far too seriously. It's not a music video, it's not a rap song, it's vaguely teenage witch fiction. Something happened with the writers that has removed all semblance of structure and what was ok acting is so over the top it's unwatchable. A sad indicator was the opening sequence with the actors speaking as themselves and how really awful they were. Unlikeable and arrogant. Too bad I thought that this show was going to be the next Buffy of a different generation in terms of Sabrina being the chosen one, playing out the role of a powerful young woman. However, everything in this show is far simple and feels lackluster that there really is no comparison between the two shows. Any real themes or plot devices used in Sabrina cannot even be taken seriously because everything feels cringe-inducing and tacky. I wanted to like this show, but I just can't. Three seasons is too long for me to still feel unconvinced. Last year was WAY better. This year it is a musical in every episode. Went from an slightly edgy show last year to a high school sing along this year. Yet another conundrum for the people of Greendale. All because of Sabrina, so it portrays.
Watching this season, was somewhat of a luckluster effort by me in response to a luckluster effort by the writers. The shows inability to hold the audience in a suspensory state, was vividly on show. Season 1 did a decent job season 2 tried to follow suit. However in season 3, I'd like to think the writes gave up.
Predictable storyline plot overshadowed good performance from those involved, although there were different storylines going on, which was very much appreciated.
Note to writers: killing off less than impressionable characters will not affect the feelings of the audince in anyway.
Overall Sabrina season 3 was less than a fun watch from its previous seasons, less capitivating, less resistance from the enemy leading to less action, wasted dialogue with no direct links to the plot of the story, which for an 8 episode season was definitely not a good idea.<br/><br/>Sub Score:-
Storylines - 6/10
Action - 2/10
Dialogue 4/10 (some funny jokes to ease the non existent tension)<br/><br/>Score 5/10<br/><br/>Here's to hoping for much more exuberating Season 4. Ok there is a teenage witch living with 2 aunts because her parents died but that's where the similarities end.
The lighthearted comedy that made being a witch OK even to Jesus freaks is nowhere to be found.
There is evil at every turn and the devil plays a major part of the story. This makes the show unwatchable to even more open minded religious folks.
Being a witch is exactly what the inquisition made it out to be & they even tie in the Salem witch trials in the show.
I gave the first season my best effort but if there is a season 2 I will be giving it a pass and I use terms like Jesus freaks so I'm obviously not a born again or regular church goer and this was still just too evil for me. Disappointed with the second season.
The story was appalling and very predictable. I liked this series, although I didn't adore it. I think that what makes the show interesting is the character of Michelle Gomez. She has personality, charisma, mystery, weakness, strength, ability to love, learn ... She is undoubtedly the best character and actress of the first two seasons. Besides her, Miranda Otto was also quite nice, followed by Lucy Davis.
The lead actress, Sabrina, didn't shine so much, possibly because the script is less spirited and creative in the part that surrounds it. I enjoyed the first season, it was dark and a different slant on the comics and original show, but season 2 has been very off.
The fascism/Nazism has been very grating and has made episodes 5 and 6 distasteful. I understand the need to have an antagonist, but this is over the top. Why not just put Hitler in the show.
It's sad that Kiernan Shipka has an allergy to cats. She is a good actor, but this causes a character to the stories to be cut out.
I may finish the second season, not sure yet. It's not upto the mark... Like 1st season.. Cinematography is very dark.... Also very slow.. I was fairly obsessed with the comics and hated the cheery, light 90s "Clarissa" version. I'm absolutely obsessed with this new remake. The acting is excellent the dark undertones and character developments are darkly witty. A few extra characters like harvey and rosiland are somewhat boring but the aunts and Sabrina's cousin make up for it. Having knowledge of the comics prior helps my fangirling but I couldn't recommend a better, current witch based show. Patiently awaiting Season 2 which looks even better. Their little lame band and terrible musical numbers were atrocious. Please don't make this show nauseating and annoying like Riverdale üòàüôè
I hope next season is better, 1 & 2 were fantastic. I am so disappointed with the 3rd Season. It actually makes me angry. I've been looking forward to this season for the longest time, and what they gave us is an absolute mess. The creators of the show are back pedaling on character development, and making overall stupid mistakes. It's honestly like the creators of the show forgot about all of the story progression, and built up in Season 1 and 2. I stopped actually watching this season after episode 5, and just decided to skip through it because, it was becoming messy, and unwatchable. For the sake of season 4 I hope it gets better, because I feel like they're really losing me in this season.<br/><br/>Oh, and if by chance the creator of this series is reading this. STOP TRYING TO DO A CROSSOVER. Just make the show it's own thing. I don't want this show to end up the same as Riverdale. A show that had an amazing first season, then devolved into a flaming pile of trash. I love this series alot. It has the perfect casting insanely funny and just overall the best show I've watched this year. But it's so dark even with my brightness all the way up I made it to the begining of the second season but honestly could've easily left it at any point before that.
I want to like it, I really do, but finding it hard to actually care about/like Sabrina. Sorry to say but Shipka is not a good actress, and a poor choice for the lead role. She plays every scene with the little variation in her expression which leaves the viewer feeling indifferent in scenes where they should be feeling quite emotional.
I kinda like how theyve made it darker but at the same time they haven't matured the plot at all, which is a problem.
I also feel unsure about who the real antagonist is?
The series isn't the worst thing in the world and still watchable but certainly wont be a favourite. I liked the old Sabrina series and also heard people calling this series the new Buffy which i loved so had really high hopes and feel let down. It cant contend with Buffy and lost the likability of the original Sabrina. When the show focuses on its characters and the wonderful supernatural world it's built, it's quite enjoyable. There's a lot of interesting lore around witchcraft. Sabrina's identity struggle is well done, particularly in the first season.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the show often gets distracted with a very blunt attempt to shove a radical social narrative down its viewers throats. Male characters are frequently stereotyped as boorish, sex craved, and stupid. Gender identity is treated without nuance or balance.<br/><br/>The political narrative is not nearly as sophisticated as the core of what the show seems like it should be about, and serves only as distraction. What started in season 1 as an original tv cocept as a hard edge Archie spinoff turned ou in season 2 to be a male dogfight for sabrina.the writing was horrible. The devil coming to earth the second most supreme being in the universe falling for a two bit plan to stop him by a bunch of witches in a small town no one heard about come on writers give your head a shake. if this series keeps going like this it iis headed to the road of obilvion. Now Sabrina and and her team are attacking hell really....tihis series progressed from someting edgy to a teeny sitcom with sabrinas love interests, Forget season 2. If you have to watch it watch the 1st 3 episodes and skip to the last. The rest is filler. I was so excited when I found out ages ago that Netflix was bringing out a new version of the classic show Sabrina: The Teenage Witch. I loved this show as a kid. It had everything I loved growing up; magic, fun comedy, a talking cat, cute boys. What wasn't there to love about it? I thought Melissa Hart played the character of Sabrina perfectly. So yes, when I heard there was going to be a modern version made, I was really enthusiastic. The trailers were promising. I loved the Halloweenesque vibe, I immediately loved the reference to old horror classics. At first glance it looked like it was keeping to the comedy bubbly factor, Sabrina dancing using her powers. Of course I saw the dark twists of the trailer and the hints to Salem witch history. It did take a dark turn in the trailer with scenes of occult and "Devil" worship, but still it looked good. I especially loved the use of English born actors. Michelle Gomez is a fantastic actress and stunning! I wasn't a huge fan of Lucy Davis but as the character of Hilda, I thought she fit it well.<br/><br/>Once I started the show though, as much as I loved many aspects of it. I was sadly disappointed. I'm sorry but I can only be brutally honest. As much as I loved the scenes, the aesthetics, the clothes, the characters. There were many points which made me say "wtf". I noticed there were parts which seemed to skip time (time hop). Some scenes portrayed a 1950's-1960's, horror Grease movie. The cars were 1950's style, the clothing choices sometimes had a 70's vibe. But then in the next scene, there was the use of laptops, and mobile phones, modern TV's. Some scenes appeared very rushed. One story-arc that comes to mind is the very quick romance between Ambrose and the other Warlock. One scene they are talking, hinting that he once dated another Warlock. In the next scene he magics himself into his bedroom and they go at it like rabbits, no context or anything.<br/><br/>The more I watched the less magic there was, it was mostly devil worship and occult practice. The best way I can describe my feelings of the show towards the end was a teen-flick version of the show Salem, with less gore. I got the impression too that the side storyline's between the non-witch-characters was that they were tying to force political opinions. It was very pro-women. Women rallying against hypocrisy. These issues were pushed at you at any given opportunity during almost all school scenes, it even introduces a character who is dealing with gender-fluidity. I will always support people in whatever choices they make and whatever their beliefs are. But I got the impression this show, for the most part, was trying to shove as many modern issues into the show as possible, to say they've at least covered it keep the reviewers happy.<br/><br/>I now take a deep breath as I come to the next point that sticks out, call me a boring old hag if you want. The sex. Sabrina and her friends are supposed to be 15, as Sabrina is turning 16 when she would become baptized as a full witch. I know that in our modern time, sex is more knowledgeable in our young community. But I do think the show should have toned it down, just a little. Some scenes had me shocked. I reference the teen orgy scene in the mines. For someone who is "Harvey" this and "Harvey" that, she had no problem shoving her tongue down the lads throat in that scene. There are times, tastefully, you see her naked, which I think at 15/16 is a bit much. And there was one scene in that the jock boys (you never see it), but they lift the shirt of the gender-fluid character "to try and see if she had breasts". Yes, this would have been awful, but what gets me is that nothing was done about it by the school, so it becomes part of the storyline of Sabrina getting revenge on them, rather than going to the police to press charges. But oh, when the girl stands up for herself and lashes out, she is the one who is punished and suspended. I mean come on.<br/><br/>The show has/could have so much potential. I loved many points to it. Historical references, references to old horror. The B Horror style, the Halloweentown aesthetics. Heck, even the CGI I thought was on point. The acting was superb, the character choices were great. I will defiantly watch Season 2. I've not completely forsaken the show. I just wish it addressed some of these points I've talked about. Season 1 of "Chilling Adventures of Sabrina" is ok. I liked the new take, a lot darker and it felt more current to nowadays audience. I just wish it would have been a lot darker, it just touches the surface, because, to be honest, the feeling of "danger", isn't really there, as Sabrina always finds a way to help herself.
And episode 10 didn't really impress it, it felt like "as it was supposed to happen" and the town really bought in the "tornado", so everyone goes into one building. It felt rushed.<br/><br/>Other things:
<ul><li>the baddies become sort of good and the magic school (beside the statue that you will see a lot) doesn't feel magic</li><li>It just is another school, as Sabrina goes to both and we never touch on the grades, because who cares about that, right?</li><li>It also had moments when it felt too cramped, too many B-side plots, which I didn't care that much, as they were poorly done (or just done and, then, back to Sabrina) - there is no impact of watching them, overall, might as well be excluded.</li><li>Also, one of the other things was her friends finding out she is a witch. One would expect this would take a toll on them and us, as a viewer, but it doesn't, as when Sabrina confesses, she continues with what she has done for Harvey, starts crying, her friends hug her and accept it - jesus, is that the world nowadays? We just accept things, are we giving up on our emotions and reasoning?</li><li>the 2-3 episodes focused on the relationship between Sabrina and Harvey. What she does to "help him" is totally off the charts, like no one, in the right mind, would even consider it. Maybe this follows the comics? If so...why would anyone do that? And, then, after being rejected again (the first time was in episode 1, but she put a spell on him), she just cries and sort-of moves on.</li><li>when Harvey remembers and hears that Sabrina put a spell on him, he just needs time - he does not get scared or even consider telling his friends or family, he just needs time (because 16th century kids have seen it all and he is not impressed - i am ironic)</li></ul><br/><br/>Season 2.....
Note: I didn't think about this show as feminist, until I read some reviews (this after watching season 1, a few days ago) and, although some points were valid, the show still didn't go off rails, or it wasn't that obvious to me. Even though we do have most of the characters as females, but that didn't bother me, in Season 1.
Now, with this in mind, season 2 gets weirder, as the feminist and gender becomes a lot more important, like forget about Sabrina. Ohh...I mean 'Brina (that's why her shirt has a B on it, in the series title, and not S).
I only watched the first 2 episodes, because it got boring:
<ul><li>as this show is for teens, now you will see, sometimes, boys pecks (and everyone goes to gym - maybe Harvey goes there, also, later?)</li><li>in Episode 1, we kick it up a notch with Sabrina wanting to be the Top Boy in the Magic School. Why? Because gender should not be an issue. Do we touch on what a Top Boy would do, in this episode? No, we do not, that is not important. What is important is that girls should be allowed to apply for it.</li><li>One of Sabrina's friends (all are girls, in the regular school) wants to play basketball, but only boys do that - do you see a pattern here? - so she talks to the Principle (which now is Lilith - because why not?) and the principle talks to the coach and she can join the trail.</li><li>in just happens that Sabrina attends, in the shadow, these trials and 100% helps her friend to score (and she scores all the time). Everyone cheers for this friend and she is in. That's all it took, one game. I am not American, but is that who trials really work?</li><li>this friend no longer identifies as a girl, bus as a boy, he now wants to be called Theo (and everyone is on board with it) - again, there is a pattern, as when the show demands, there will be no conflict, we just move on, we are stupid viewers</li><li>Sabrina is attacked by superior demons, as there are forces that don't want her to ascend. She manages to escape from all of them using the power of the main character. Everything is at hand, there is no real danger.</li><li>instead of picking one of 2 contestants, as they go against the High Priest, another one is chosen, some who we know, Sabrina's cousin. And that is it. Everyone accepts it and moves on. The whole equality point, who cares? We got everyone safe, so it doesn't matter who gets picked, in the end. Jesussssss!!!!!!!!</li><li>girls are really h"rny, especially one of Sabrina's friends. When talking to Harvey, in a restaurant (just the 2 of them) - nothing suspicious, they became close by the power of screen writing - she touches his hand (because that's who normal people connect, only romantically; touching on the shoulder is too barbaric, am i right?) and she gets a vision (side note: in season 1, the visions were very relevant to her new powers and she gets scary visions or paranormal ones) that she will kiss Harvey (and now a good show turns into a teen horny drama).</li><li>this friend that was supposed to go blind because of a disease that runs into the family (one of the fears from Season 1) never really happens and we forget about it in Season 2 - because, you know, we need her to keep on seeing, so she can get to kiss Harvey</li><li>Harvey invites this girl to try to do a scene together, the Romeo and Juliet where they kiss - is it weird? No, not at all, as she is really into him since she got that vision</li><li>Sabrina no longer needs to go to the human school, thanks to a talk with the Principle (and we accept it, as well as Sabrina's aunties)</li><li>the B,C, D plots intensify, already, from episode 1 of Season 2 - this show should be called "Teen drama - it has witches in it"</li></ul><br/><br/>This is what we needed, a 16th Century, with a character we loved when we were young, but now focused on gender identification, genders and feminist power.<br/><br/>I am out of this show. The show started well. It distinguished wicca from satan-worshipping witches, it introduced the mysterie of the death of Sabrina's parents, her conflict of selling her free will, the lying tendencies of the coven, the conflict between the coven and family, issues of faith...<br/><br/>The first sign of decline was the inconsistencies in Ambrose's storyline. It was obvious That Guy went to him only to kill that familiar. But then shown up at the randevu. And there seemed someone written him as a mortal. Then he disappeared. As he should have had long ago. Then somehow he was in true love with Ambrose?
Well, whatever, at least I loved Perdomo's acting.<br/><br/>Another sign was the gradual decline of screentime of the mortal-school.<br/><br/>But then at the end of the show just killed the show. Sabrina is now only a tool in the hands of Satan, and I could care less who'll be Queen of Whatever. Additionaly Sabrina became StarWarsRey, so the only possible way to lure me back would be to suddenly make her The Villain of the series, entirely carved out, and the body fully controlled 100% of the time by Satan. Because Sabrina herself is a bumbling, inexperienced greenear, not very good at plotting. OMG this season is completly a huge mess !! Like as if it's a real nightmare, all the time I was like : bro what ? what is going on ? lol So confusing and you feel like you are watching a very cheap play with cheap costumes !! I don't know if the director and the writers of the first 2 seasons are the same in this season because there is absolutely a huge difference between them in all aspects !!
Disappointing !! The first season was good. It had a thrilling atmosphere, some decent mixture of horror and teen drama. Season 2 was a downgrade but it still delivered fine performance and vibes of the 1st season. Unfortunately, Season 3 is a disaster! The plot does not make any sense, characters are kind of blank, musical numbers along with forced diversity agenda turned this show into low-quality teen romp. It's just a mess. Saw the trailers and it looked great, 15 minutes into it and I changed my mind, its nothing but non stop ramming femenism and pc culture down your throat, such a shame as the acting and potential was great The feminism side plot aspect is really cringe worthy. Otherwise, great show. First of all, the biggest difference from the previous productions of the series is that the script is based entirely on Archie comics. I can say that Chilling Adventures of Sabrina has recently become a candidate for being one of the best series that has centered on supernatural powers. In the new adaptation story, unlike the innocent spells Sabrina made to those who were annoyed at high school, we are watching the struggle of a young girl to make herself do as she wishes. The powerful feminist references in the series highlight both the character of Sabrina and the series.<br/><br/>The series that makes references to discrimination in society through the human and non-human equation, does not neglect to touch the discourse of racism in recent times. Why can't I be both a witch and a human being? In Sabrina's rebellious attitude is a good reference to the problem of not being a place where many immigrants live today. Sabrina's decision to decide which world to belong to is a good example. The fact that Sabrina is forced to choose a side brings a separate criticism to the multi-cultural understanding of society in which the extreme right-wing parties, which are at the center of today's socio-cultural debates, and which are rising thoroughly in the world. You can easily understand why Kiernan Shipka, who we know from Mad Men, is the first choice of the producers. A 16-year-old naive, excited, in love with a young girl as well as a well-grounded portrait of a courageous young girl who never dies from fighting for the things she believes in is drawing her very well. Shipka is best when Sabrina's mortal side is in play, when she's getting silly or excited with her friends, or bucking the satanic system. She never falls below the performances of Hilda (Lucy Davis) and Zelda (Miranda Otto) aunts.<br/><br/>Chilling Adventures of Sabrina is much more than the story of an adolescent witch with its horror and tension. This series offers its viewers a very different look with Sabrina with wit and ready-to-answer dialogues, fearless intrigues in her mystical and dark atmosphere, and feminist references. 7/10 First 2 seasons were pure 10 but with all the melodrama in season 3 and god awefull musical numbers in every episode this show is not for me anymore. As the headline says, season one was watchable and even enjoyable at moments. Season two, however, is forcing EXTREME feminists and transgender agendas down the viewers throat. It's to the point where those who aren't down with a chick pretending to be a boy in the locker room get their legs broken with magic. For real? Plus Sabrina's feminist views went from "equal rights" in the first season to down right obnoxious in the second.
The political crap was so bad that this is my first review ever, and I watched The Last Jedi. I have never been quite so violently disgusted and disappointing with the quality of writing in a show.
There is nothing more saddening than seeing something that could have been made into a great remake of an amazing comic and a childhood favourite turned into some cheap, badly thought-out sword of virtue signaling brownie points.<br/><br/>There is no excuse to how absolutely basic this show is. Not only is the plot the most offensively ridiculous caricature of "all women are victims, all males are literally Hitler unless they agree to this", characters go out of their way to destroy their own development, change opinions, characterizations, roles - everything at random. There is effectively no purpose to 95% of the cast as of season 2, other than being a minority token that stands in the background acquiring good self-esteem karma for the writers.
And I am perfectly fine with minority representation. Hell, I am part of several minorities! But these characters do absolutely nothing; their plots are irrelevant, their personalities are horrible, their behavior is insulting to the minorities they aim to represent to say the least, and not a single good moral can be harvested from any of the interactions in the show.<br/><br/>The summarization of the entire season 2 can be boiled down to "Somehow, everyone in the main cast is a worst person than Satan." - you know, the guy that wants to run the place as a tyrant and make us all burn for eternity? Yeah, somehow he doesn't kill, cheat and screw over anywhere near as many people as the main cast does. This is literal; he. doesn't.<br/><br/>This show is actively offensive towards women, teaching them to play victim, cheat, whine and screw over others and never actually rely on their own skill; there is no good moral about being smart, clever, or even powerful like everyone else and that gender should not matter.
None of that. The show wants to tell you you deserve to win if you are a woman, and your worth as a person is irrelevant because anything you do is excused under the light of glorious feminist wonder.
It's outright embarassing. This is an amazing show! Unfortunately, the overwhelming, proactive transgender/politically correct language used makes it unwatchable :/ Maybe focus on the witches and not on the little girl who wants male anatomy. Maybe check her into a mental hospital until she can figure out her problems so we can enjoy the real story. I want to see demons and spells and fighting...not a mentally disturbed child and her friends who support her destructive behavior.<br/><br/>Really wish I could finish the show, but it's just too much. I really want to rate this show higher.
But I can't.<br/><br/>The first season was excellent! And then they rushed out the second season really quickly. The quality wasn't as good, still not bad- until the last episode.
... why the felt the need to add in musical numbers is beyond me.
The needless musical episodes killed Riverdale for me. Now they are doing the same thing to Chilling Adventures of Sabrina.<br/><br/>Please stop. I was waiting for it to be released but got seriously disappointed. So many things put together that really cannot be combined I watched the first season right when it came out and absolutely loved it! I was worried it was going to be too much of a teeny bopper show but I loved how dark it got! It got even darker in season/part 2!! Some parts were even a tad scary but I absolutely loved it. I binged part two in 4 days and I'm so sad I'm out of episodes. Kiernan Shipka is so cute and spunky. I love how they push the envelope. I can't wait for part 3!!! (Season 3) This isn't the cheesy feel-good comedy that was "Sabrina: The Teenage Witch" - but I was OK with that. I enjoyed the other, but I'd rather something different than a copy, and if nothing else, this show successfully conveyed a different mood.<br/><br/>This show tried hard to deliver something different - a spooky, moody interpretation. It feels like it's set in the 60s, but it's hard to tell (and from what I watched, deliberately vague), but waffles on about white patriarchy and misogyny.<br/><br/>I'm not kidding. The show is full on over-the-top "woke", and not remotely subtle about it. And that's just the first episode.<br/><br/>Complete trash. I was going to give it one star, but I figured it deserved an extra for trying to be not just a reboot. Alas, it's rubbish. Don't be discouraged by the comments you read here by ppl who are against social awareness in television! This is exactly what Hollywood needs!! I loved every episode and can't wait for more! And btw, for those of you who criticize Hollywood... try watching just Canadian cinema, or Indian cinema, or any other cinema for that matter, instead. Sure they've all made a few great products, but come off it! Such childish comments. The extreme reaction this show is getting, including the negative, is a good thing. You've made many ppl happy and entertained and ticked off a few others.. and don't you dare let that bother you. Lastly, try and imagine To Kill A Mockingbird without its 'politics'... it's a ridiculous criticism by ppl who need to be made uncomfortable. Original sabrina was fun, bright, funny... and this is dark, occult, satanic, boring... why are they promoting satanism???why!!? Make series with angels and good stuff not dark and all that satanic s*** I seriously didn't think it would be this great! I'm proud of what they made like for real! Is it better than Riverdale? YES IT IS! I mean I still watch Riverdale but if U don't like Riverdale and are confused wether to watch this or not DO IT! It's totally worth the time and energy cause believe me it's amazing!! Probably one of the best shows this year! Sadly and interesting story about girl finding her own path is littered with "bad toxic males" in school. This tv show reminds me of the Clinton campaign. Beta males, SJW everybody and the literally bash and hate Christianity and the church in just about every single episode. There is a transgender supporting actress and more ethnic actors than white ones. What really shocks me the most is the constant devil worship where they exhaust the devil constantly. These political undertones really hurt this show I find. If only they took the Hollywood extreme left politics out of this show then it could have been closer to a Buffy 2.0 tv series. Unfortunately, that is not the case though.
The story is adult oriented with series issues and for the most part is just ok. The men are bumbling idiots except for the boyfriend beta male who does what he is told by Sabrina and worships the ground she walks on like a good beta male. I give this show a generous 6/10, but it could have been a 7.5 without all the politics and heretical devil worship. This is not a show for teens as the teens in this show act and talk like college grads and deals with some very adult themes. Why is this show getting such bad reviews?<br/><br/>I'm a 22 year old who thoroughly enjoys this teen drama. I just finished the second season and I can't wait for the next.<br/><br/>The Melissa Joan Hart fanbase needs to understand this Sabrina is completely different from that Sabrina.<br/><br/>If you are uncomfortable with the mention of Satan, worshipping him, hell, etc (basically if you're extremely catholic) please don't watch this show. Don't come on here and bash it because you hate how they are talking of the devil. Come on now.<br/><br/>This show is a fun adventure to follow when you have nothing else to watch on a Saturday night. Cozy up on the couch and enjoy. It's not the best show I've ever seen, but it's a rollercoaster of fun. I found myself in love with all of the characters- the "bad" and the "good" and in some way, rooting for all of them at the same time.<br/><br/>The show isn't going to make you think, it's not going to win any awards- but it's fun. It truly is. It's a different kind of dark- yes, it involves Satan. But it's not the type of dark that's going to leave you speechless and disturbed.<br/><br/>If you're torn between watching it or not because of the bad reviews, just do it. Go in not expecting the new next best show of the decade. This ain't it. But it's an enjoyable experience with lots of fun and lots of drama that I really love to keep up with. Part 2 is a lot darker and better the first series Nonsense useless stupid waste of time.<br/><br/>It's amazing to think a group of people approved and funded this crap..<br/><br/>A direct insult of our intelligence..<br/><br/>What happened to good tv√∞≈∏Àú‚Äò Seriously, just no. The mere fact that they replaced the talking cat Salem with a random black cousin is already extremely cringeworthy and screams 'OH NO WE NEED TO MAKE THIS SHOW DIVERSE' to me. Sure, Salem is still there, but his original role is now replaced by a human, which is a big nono to me. Salem was the one role they shouldn't have touched/changed at ALL, yet here they go and it ruined the entire show for me. Adding diversity is fine, but don't replace the talking cat, ffs.<br/><br/>Anyway, besides that horrible mistake, their new takes on Hilda and Zelda are just terrible. Why make Zelda a pretentious snobby woman? She used to be wise and kind. And the writers somehow find it necessary to give Hilda a pea for a brain instead of making her the fun wild aunt she used to be.<br/><br/>Sabrina and Harvey are actually the only ones they didn't mess up, but unfortunately the plot has changed so much from the original that it's not enough to reignite that old spark. Why did they take away the aspect where becoming a witch was a total surprise to Sabrina? That was one of the best parts. Now she's suddenly already completely prepared for her life as a witch and even already has all the knowledge she needs. It's boring. It's bad. All aspects they changed from the old show are only for the worse. Just leave the classics alone if you can't live up to them, please. Kiernan Shipka is amazing and believable. This series introduces thought-provoking ideas. Definitely original. Worth having a look-see. Random things kept happening. Such a bad direction. Do not watch and save your time. Men kissing men, lesbians, bad hair dye jobs, bad haircuts, minority heroes and evil white men.<br/><br/>The show has no connection to the fabled TV series; it only steals the names. I was hoping for more, but the in your face political correctness really turned us off. Instead of being what the show potentially had promise for, it strove more for political statements than entertainment. It was a squandered opportunity.<br/><br/>Some episodes were just to kill time, with no purpose or enhancement to the plot at all, as if the writers had a contract to deliver a certain number of episodes but ran out of ideas so created boring filler to stretch things out. The writers who wrote the characters of the friends and their C story need to all be fired.<br/><br/>Come on... Her two friends are literally a black girl with an afro, driven by a cause to stop the school banning books. We are in 2019. And Sabrina's second friend is a queer boy/girl thing, and Sabrina's cousin is black and gay. It's like the writers were trying so hard to be modern, gay friendly, friendly to black people, and very cliche and boring.<br/><br/>The friends focus on the school banning books,,,, and then cliche jocks fighting the non binary girl/boy, and then the girls creating a 'feminist club'.<br/><br/>This is not the 70s, do something new and original.<br/><br/>Everything with the magic was great, but seriously fire the writers of the friends and their forgettable lives. Every episode of the second season seems to be more and more politically driven. The only thing mystifying about this show is how the writers thought they were doing a good job. The first two seasons are great. Great writing, great theming, great plots, music and mood is excellent. Even the acting is really good. Then at the very last episode of season 2 you can just feel what's coming, it's like everyone is thinking, wow, our show is really popular now and we can just do whatever we want next season. The first episode of season 3 is total cornball. The music is stupid. The acting is cheesy/corny. The writing is awful. It's like the show went directly from Netflix to Nickelodeon. I don't know if all the producers and writers walked away or what happened but the show just sucks now. We literally had to step away from a show that we blissfully binge watched for two seasons and that saddens me. Just bad stuff. The main character is overly into herself and her acting has only gotten worse as the seasons go by. Please do us all a favor and stop at season 3. I watch a rather large varity of genre or tv series and movies. (Feel like I should know whats out there since my son is in the business! Gotta be able to converse!)
I thought this series was pretty mature for the young adult audience I supposed it was for. ( I've seen 2 seasons so far)The vocabulary and behaviors of the kids are mature..... not too much mushy crushy love stuff, and not too much idiotic behavior of high school age kids. There was content I hadn't heard or seen on other witch craft shows as well. I thought it was pretty good! I'm ready for season 3, I think. The last scene in season 2 when Sabrina says she wants to go to hell to get her boyfriend made me cringe.....I hope it doesn't get stupid! Listen, it's a Sabrina the Teenage Witch adaptation...they did a great job! It's a fun ride...yes, there is quite a bit of left political leanings, but so what? It's fun and far more grown up and darker! The acting, for the most part, is good and Sabrina is believable...stop looking for academy awards! Just sit back and enjoy the ride! It's not meant to have some deep meaning, it's fun! I was hoping for a gritty and dark show alike the comics.
Instead, we got a cringy show that feels like the whole plot was written to push an agenda.
Most characters are depicted in a black and white manner, with Sabrina really being the only character with actual ethical conundrums (guess why? she's half witch and half mortal!). For such a strong and independent character, the story is not really about sabrina taking morally dubious decisions, it's only about her reacting to increasingly unrealistic misogynistic threats.
For a show that depicts satanism as a religion of free will, it seems like all women before sabrina were too stupid or too lazy to realize they were being controlled? Really?<br/><br/>
The visual setting of the show is good though even if some effects (glamour for example - camera displacement to allow actor replacement...) could have been introduced in a show with this budget.
Overall,I watched it because I like the supernatural setting, but the plot is becoming increasingly stupid. I only made it through the show because the atmosphere, sets, music, etc were awesomely spooky and simply made for a great, fun, spooky Halloween vibe. But the story seemed like a lot and nothing all happened at the same time. Season 2 and 3 are as trashy as they come. Sabrina's character becomes more mean instead of becoming dark (I guess it was intended to make the character dark).
And the characters are very self absorbed except the mortal kids... because sabrina needs helpless people around her to become a hero (I guess). I should have known better than to go near teenie drama's. That said I rather liked the original Sabrina back in the 90's. It had just enough going for it as a lighthearted comedy to be accessible to a broad viewership.<br/><br/>Not so with the new make over. This series is squarely focused on teens but that said looking back even as a teen, I'd have found this puerile and annoying.<br/><br/>The main character Sabrina is an irritating poster child for political correctness. Her fad laden, pseudo feminist musing's are validated by blatantly misogynistic characterizations, easy fodder for Sabrina's weedy, feminist outrage.<br/><br/>Worse still this attitude permeates the whole series. The idea of telling a story about a young witch or even making a decent comedy is crushed beneath 16 going on 36 cynical Sabrina's, tiresome crusades. Even when that's not the case, her chronic overdose of self absorbed prattle, does little to lighten the mood.<br/><br/>Its not helped either by aunt characters who offer up more of the same. Delighted at the idea of using the blood of a young murdered man for Sabrina's ritual initiation into witch hood........"ugh".<br/><br/>In my view one to avoid. 2/10. Liked the first part of the season but not understanding why now. Im finding it not chilling in anyway and all a bit Twee and boring. Am i wrong? For some reason it seems a lot of reviews are from people comparing it to Sabrina the teenage witch. This is following the comic series showing the darker side of Sabrina and what she is dealing with. It's not supposed to be a revamped sitcom so if that's what you are expecting, this show might not be for you. I have enjoyed the show so far and it has me wanting to start the next episode immediately at the end of the previous. This was a well written TV show that has great Potential season 1 was more about other people rather than Sabrina. But in season 2 everything got more up beat and more focused on Sabrina and more satanic rituals. When the gates of hell open Satin Morning star and all heaven breaks loose. I tried to get into this series as I generally like the "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" type fantasy stuff. After watching, Serena has nothing for Buffy. Watched the whole series and unfortunately disliked more than I liked. Not to say it was all bad cause the acting was generally good, or lets just say it could have been a lot worse. Got a little tired of the cliche Satan stuff, started to get a little irritating as it was overdone, glorifying pretty much kind of a stupid looking goat making strange noises. And of course, wait for it, I was waiting for the gay warlocks to show up and sure as heck they're in there. I called it before the series even started, Hollywood right on cue. What was up with Zelda and the cigarette on that stupid ring clip on virtually every scene she was in? What was hilarious is she didn't take one hit on it ever, not one. I mean Hollywood, was that cigarette really necessary? Made it look like it got put in just for the tobacco money, no doubt about it. Serena in this was actually a pretty stupid teenager. Way too naive and never seemed to see anything coming. I got tired of her "dumbness". Satan was also pretty stupid. All the stuff being done behind his back and he saw none of it. Pretty lame Satan. Season 1, cooked and done. Will wait another year and then decide if I want to watch anymore of this. Netflix must have liked it, they renewed it for two more seasons before the first one was even done. I found the first season quite engrossing, as the 'nice' witches of Greendale set up the plot and initial characterizations, getting a new story off the ground - a shaky business. Then I saw this show had the potential to be another Buffy the Vampire Slayer (we can all hope!!!), but it's success would depend on how dark and original the plot content turned out to be, and whether the characters' would grow in complexity.<br/><br/>Sabrina Season Two did not disappoint- despite my high hopes which would otherwise have led to disappointment. Sabrina is funny, terrifying, Provocative, and utterly enthralling. The writing, plot turns, and character development are all impeccable.<br/><br/>Ten stars! May the next season (somehow?) exceed all my expectations again! Sabrina is magical. Story is loose and lame, with too much political rubbish and sexism against the females in an era where women are equal to men and shouldn't be a premise of a series anyway. Also very hypocritical when Sabrina is chosen by the lord they serve and supposed to help fulfil his will they're all like "oh no we can't allow that" I quit watching because of all this rubbish. AVOID I found the second season as good or better than the 1st. The plot this season was really good. I binged watched it in a day. The cast was great and the acting was really good. I enjoyed it very much The demonology and devil worship is cool and informative, but damn, at what price. Sure they intended to express the naivity of young teenager but it is so over the top it is painful to watch. Very unlikeable protagonist. Bad bad writing. So sorry for this review, I am an Spanish fan of the 2 first seasons, but... This season is a mess, super boring, super bad plot... Good images, costumes and good decorations. That's all.
I don't know, it is just like watching a teenage show.
Hope season 4 improves this bad feelings. This show had so much potential and failed at every opportunity. It's hard to care about almost every character. Sabrina is flat out annoying. Most of the acting and writing is poor, making it hard to connect to characters. Nearly every action feels like it comes out of convenience for the poorly strung together plot. So many plot holes. It just isn't very good. I really want to like this show. There's a lot to enjoy, but I can't get passed Kiernan's acting. It feels too forced and like she is just playing a character. An annoying one at that.
Don't like tearing another woman down, but I wish they had chosen someone else. Ok, the start of season 2 was pretty good. Really enjoyed the church of night and her dark side, but as soon as her normal life came in to play the quality dropped immenesly.
And lets not even talk about the ending (which was absolute garbage btw) and its horrible writing.
Sorry to say this but I was extremely dissapointed with season 2. It had so much potential. 'Chilling Adventures of Sabrina' (CAoS) follows sixteen year old Sabrina Spellman through her inner struggles over being half-witch, half-mortal and the difficulties of attempting to straddle both the magical and mortal worlds whilst simultaneously not truly belonging to either.<br/><br/>Although there are superficial similarities between CAoS and the original show 'Sabrina the Teenage Witch', CAoS is it's own distinctive series and fans that are a fan of 'Sabrina the Teenage Witch' should try not to compare the two since they're vastly different perspectives on the same universe. I haven't read the comic books personally, but I would imagine this is more closely aligned with the comic books than 'Sabrina the Teenage Witch' which had a lot of the darker elements removed and a more comedic spin to appeal to a younger audience.<br/><br/>When I saw the popularity of CAoS and the hype surrounding it, I was really excited to give it a go. Unfortunately, I can't understand the appeal of the show and stopped watching after 6 episodes. Everything about the series is mediocre - the plot (which is practically non-existent), the characterisation of the characters, the mythology/magic, the acting, the relationships between the characters, the cringey attempts at being 'hipster' with the constant references to 'feminism'. The setting is about the only thing I like about it, although even that suffers from horrendous lighting choices in a lot of scenes. Although there are some fantastic cast members that I know and enjoyed in other projects (Kiernan Shipka from Showtime's Flowers in the Attic, Ross Lynch from Austin and Ally, Lucy Davis from Shaun of the Dead, Michelle Gomez from Doctor Who, Miranda Otto from Lord of the Rings etc.), the performances from all of the cast members feel average and rather stiff.<br/><br/>The main issue with CAoS is that there is NO plot at all. I got to episode 6 of the series and I still couldn't even begin to attempt to describe WHAT it was I was watching or what it was leading to. Everything just sort of happens with no purpose or meaning. The only real story-line is Sabrina's quest to find her own identity, but she's such an infuriating character that it's hard to root for her or to even care. Sabrina is the cliche of a strong, independent young woman which has become the trend in television in more recent years, but it is all based on stereotypes of what 'feminism' is. She's argumentative, out-spoken, defiant and all around, the kind of girl that does something specifically because she's been told not to to make a point that she's her own person. Kiernan Shipka is a talented young actress, but it's a shame she's been lumbered playing such a poorly written character who is so detestable.<br/><br/>People that are fans of the comic books may have more enjoyment to find with the series, but for me, it failed to tick any boxes. It was boring and I'd even go as far as to say, I disliked it (which I don't say about many shows). As a horror series, it falls to have any real impact. It has dark elements, but it's not suspenseful or scary in the slightest. It feels more like a horror spoof than a genuine supernatural horror. There is nothing appealing and I think the only reason it gets such high ratings is because people (millenials, in particular) were excited to see a series based on a show from their childhood. Unfortunately, it fails to accomplish anything of any significance and anyone that is a fan of Sabrina would be better sticking with the teen show or the comic books. Honestly I don't get it why so many people dislike this series. I think its very entertaining and I like how the way effects are made because it does not seem that professional but in some way it makes it outstanding and funny. I really love the characters and story line and the way Sabrina changes to dark Sabrina! Some people may argue about her acting, but I don't think its that bad. Of course 11 from Stranger Things is an awesome actress but "Chilling Adventures", as the title is already saying, is more about making the story not too horrifying and yet funny. Cant wait for the next season release! People awarding this series very low scores need to get over themselves.
Is the acting reasonable or very good? Yes, the acting is very good. Characters are convincing in their roles.
How is the script/writing? Is it okay or clever? It is very good and cleverly written.
The genre is chilling and bordering on horror and definitely supernatural because it is about witches and black religion.
That is where some viewers have been challenged. I knew it would upset some people who were unable to come to terms with all the digs at Christianity. It is non fiction and written from the viewpoint of the black satanic culture. But not everyone is evil. There are degrees of evil where mortals are neither good nor bad. And sometimes the witches do good deeds and care about the mortals.
It is not my favourite genre but I can appreciate when something is well done and this series is polished and,clever. Also, there are a few laughs along the way.
You cannot award a one or a two or a three to a show that ticks the basic boxes of being well acted and has a decent storyline. Seriously, you can make a series that has a dark tone without being ACTUALLY dark. Most of the scenes were so poorly lit that I could make out what was going on. Too bad, because I was genuinely interested in the witch world. Season 1 was great, nd then it just went downhill. s2 is still watchable but worse, and by s3 we're getting a regurgitated riverdale. unfortunate that the series went downhill so fast, but i don't regret watching nd ill still recommend s1 :) First and second seasons were good but musical, are you serious? This show is a gem! This is one of the shows where character development seems real, and authentic all throughout the course of seasons.<br/><br/>You don't find anything wrong here, it's purely perfect. There are a few loopholes, and a few drawbacks, but with such good acting, writing and execution, that is one compromise you would willingly make!<br/><br/>The storyline is very good for the first season, with some loose ends, that complete themselves in the next ones.<br/><br/>It felt to me like the first season was a foundation for the next seasons. Everything that is portrayed in the first one, id organically taken forward and there's a consistent flow throughout the episodes.<br/><br/>There are some parts where I think it could have done better, as in, there are scenes which could have been full of energy, full of drama, but it's not used properly.<br/><br/>The VFX and background scores are very good. The plot is good, it's taken forward in a way that you will understand everything properly and won't have to go around to research things again and again.<br/><br/>But some parts of the plot are executed very poorly and they should have been way more better.<br/><br/>But all in all, this is a treat to watch. You'll enjoy the world it is set in and will want to be a part of it This is one of Netflix's best shows of the last few years. It's dark but not too dark, and the settings are visually stunning. The lead actress is amazing and carries the show, but the supporting cast and story writing is also strong throughout, so it's a very complete effort. I'd highly recommend this to almost anyone and hopefully they keep it going a few more years. After watching season 1 and 2 I thought it was a great show, interesting plot and original story but season 3 it's just a mess, some scenes are so cringe and so bad written it hurts! What crap this show has turned into! And now it's a musical if they can quit crying about breakups. I'd hate to see them after a divorce.The push for teen sex is deplorable. High school pregnancy is a real problem, this show promotes teen sex. They are "16" and being a virgin is a real "problem". Poor writing! If you can't keep my attention unless someone is having sex, then you're a terrible writer and should learn about character and plot develop. What a disgrace.
Other than that, the show has really one down and you keep hoping you're at the last episode. Done with this teen crap and will not allow this trash in my home. The first two seasons were enjoyable and entertaining.
The old Sabrina from a new angle, darker and focused on the magic rather than on teenage life. The story developed well and showed a lot of potencial.
During the third season, however, they created a situation so difficult to resolve, that they ended up fixing it in a ridiculous way.
Even though the final was not as I expexted, it's a good serie ti watch with a bowl of popcorn. Good scenario, good acting, decent script, poor final. The series started good. It was dark and edgy (as I like my witchy stories to be). It kept my interest going in spite of the occasional lack of common sense of the characters. Then suddenly, out of nowhere, it turned into a musical? I mean, sure, the occasional comical breaks in between dark/heavy scenes were entertaining. But why on earth has it been turned into a musical? It has become a laughable (and not the nice kind of laughter) show. Well... even in a Sabrina World, Season 3 doesnt make sense. So many questions remain open. The feeling is that they did whatever they needed to get nice turnarounds on seasons 3, regardless of being logical. Seasons 1 and 2 were nice, though. What is up with the singing??? For God sakes stop!!!! Are they really channeling into Sabrina The Teenage Witch??? I like this show but that was cheesy. Please stop the corny hail Lilith full of disgrace prayer. That was horrible too! I cracked up when Nick told Sabrina being trapped in satan as he was being beaten felt like an eternity. They all worship Satan so much eternity with him should feel good I presume. But isnt that the point? Satan is mean and horrible not good. Its certainly not Heaven, the way they blast Heaven like it's such a bad thing. Love the cast but the plot is just a total mess.... cartoonish at best except with real people playing all the characters... none of it makes sense or close to being convincing.... It's truly disappointing... This show started off OK, then it tied itself into humourless knots and by season 3 it has become simply unwatchable badly written dribble I feel sorry for Miranda Otto and Lucy Davis.
Season 3 is embarrasing. The plot got from
fresh and fun in season 1 to completely senseles in Season 3... they even have musical numbers. I only give it 5 stars because I liked it at first. First season is about magic, witches and choices that half witch needs to make & I liked it. Second season was drooped by me, because it's about teenagers hormones and it's not watchable. I have watched all the episodes and not sure what to make of this show. First, in what is the timeline for this show? In the first season it we assume it to be the 60s and then all of a sudden Harvey has an iPhone.
But the biggest problem with this show is that it's all over the place. They need to find a central plot and go with it. There is no character development, everything resolves around Sabrina. She's the key to everything, she can stop everything, cure everyone. Stop it! In order for a show to be great, you need to focus your attention on ALL the other characters not just the central character.
They introduce certain characters and you hope they serve some sort of purpose but then it was just a waste of time. The build-up meant nothing. For example, you have Lilith who is to be wedded with Adam. Adam is killed by the Devil and Lilith creates a scarecrow Adam with her rib to kill Sabrina. Then all of a sudden in one swoop, scarecrow Adam is dead.
Also, they're messing with the Devil, this guy is supposed to be pretty powerful. But they toy around him like he's nothing. Give me props to the Devil for being the Devil.
All in all, if there is to be a season 3, it needs works. If it continues the way it does, I won't be watching it. Wouldn't have been too bad if they didn't try to shove politics down your throat the whole time. The show was cool and entertaining at first and then the politics and the fact that they're all being promoted to teenagers is a little much I gave this new series a 10/10. I am only on the third episode. This is a clear example of choosing a spectacular cast. Each actor brings something new and refreshing to their roles. Also, the effects and CGI is stunning and ravishing. Each episode leads you deeper into the life of Sabrina Spellman and Greendale as a whole. I'm very hopeful that the rest of the series will live up to the first two episodes. Well done Netflix, cast, and crew. This show could have been good, really good. But when the lead role is portrayed by such an unlikeable unconvincing actress it's hard to stay interested. Definitely mot the right casting choice. I enjoyed every single moment watching this show, Kiernan Shipka is an incredible actress and has a bright future! So, I enjoyed season one. Watched it with my wife, we were presently surprised how good the season was. The whole joke with season one was, campy, and self-awareness with the writing. It felt more of a adult Disney channel show/movie. So, you y'know. Me being me, I was really excited to watched the next season with my wife... oh boi, was I wrong.<br/><br/>Season 2 is poopy. Game of Thrones, True Detective and Mindhunter are just a few of my tastes. Big fan of cinematography, good writing and great acting. This series fills the void left by other memorable shows. Surprisingly fun and very dark. A show I look forward to seeing more of! Not sure why this has 7.8 rating. This was so awful. The acting of the main character was so strained and seemed terribly fake. The fake expressions and overacting was unwatchable. I could have tolerated all the men suck women should be bosses of everything, but I just couldn't tolerate the acting or lack thereof. I had to scroll through the reviews to make sure I wasn't crazy to absolutely abhor this series. Gladly found that many people agree with me. But seriously, who thinks this is 7.8 worthy? Most annoying part of this show (leave alone bad acting, soapy plot etc.) is the complete absence of any silence. The protagonists are talking and explaining their actions and plans all the time, literally there is not a single moment of silence and if no one speaks for a few seconds, the space is filled with way to dramatic music.
After making The Blackcoat's Daughter, Shipka should know how to do creepy stuff. And how can you manage to film 2 seasons of a horror show without showing any eerie landscapes? The character is about a privilege millennial.<br/><br/>‚≠ê<br/><br/>That is it. But I watched the whole damn thing. So take from that what you will. I guess you can't stop watching because it's too bad? This show has such a good potential, it was really good because of the unique plot and theme of "witches" worshipping the devil. These types of story are quite rare especially when the main character is on the dark side as a "witch". They presented the dark side quite acurately with the way how people worship the devil and all other activities. As for the story, it kept me on the edge with major plot twists and character developments.<br/><br/>Some people think this is a "bad" series because of the camera blurring filter. They use it to create effect for scenes where tension builds up. There is also some akward dialouges and situations which makes you cringe as an audience.<br/><br/>Despite these two problems , the series is overall an amazing one with like able characters as everyone is special in certain ways. The modern day issues are forced down your throat the entire show. Acting is very flat and boring throughout. I don't mind a darker version than the 90's fun and campy Sabrina, but this version is just garbage. The series as a concept is interesting, but having a edgy not understanding bone headed main character was the worst idea possible. Sabrina is anticlimactic uninteresting and dull to the point of boredom. Her inability to understand basic consents of the world she lives in and the way she bone headedly approaches everything is of putting. But the other cast and the story are very nice. If you can wistand sabrina you will most probably like the show. This is not the Sabrina you remember. This is a story of Satan and witches. Its so not politically correct and thats the beauty of it. I have read a lot of reviews of people taking the TV show all so serious. I just enjoy it. I dont take it to heart but want to see where it goes I like season more than the previous seasons the only thing I don't like in season 3 is the musical other than that everything is perfect teh storyline and so much more happened in that season never got bored like the others.
Season 2 was the most boring season of them all Very good like you sabrina
de best movis series
very nice Why was sabrina being soooo annoying all the time? I like the show but Sabrina makes such horrible choices that it ruins the show. Like the spooky version but they write Sabrina character so much dumber than the original one. dumb and ignorant The start was alright. It was what it was, an angsty teen drama about a witch and her struggle between her satanic obligations and her mortal desires ('I just want to have all the power and none of the responsibilities'). Which is acceptable for a naive witch in training who's 15/16 and is on the cusp of adulthood. However, as the show drags (yes, drags!) on you'll grow more and more frustrated with her childish behaviour and complete disregard for the consequences that come not only for herself but every single loved one and acquaintance in the entire show. It's ridiculous, really. The show should be called the 'Foolish Adventures of Sabrina'. Cut to season three and you find yourself near screaming at the platinum dummy 'what are you thinking?'!
Don't get me started on the 'aesthetic' of the damned show. I'm pretty sure they were going for 'zero budget Highschool production' because that's definitely what it looks like. Anything gold used in the show looked like metallic spray painted plastic and was completely unnecessary and everything else looked like the students had to burrow their parents money to buy Halloween store novelties. The make-up was terrible and did a huge disservice to especially Kiernan Shipka and Lucy Davis who are both beautiful women but I have to believe that Lucy was done so dirty because it was part of her character design (there's no other explanation for the 80s housewife disco wannabe orange face and blue eye shadow - honestly, it could've been done so much better even if that was the look they were going for).
I don't really have much to say for the writing other than it was sub-par with a side of cringe. The way these teens dealt with their life problems just seemed so unbelievable, they dragged for too many episodes and then the solution was discovered and resolved in about ten minutes and was usually Sabrina using her witchy powers to fix it and then create a new problem for the next fifty episodes.
In conclusion, season 1: Binge worthy, season 2: losing me, season 3: I'm only watching it to know how it ends and now that I know it wasn't worth it, season 4: they're making another one? I mildly enjoyed season 1 and 2 but season 3 was just boring, had horrible musical sequences and made no sense. I lost interest after a few episodes and stopped watching it. I tried hard to like it.
Satanic? Not really. Full of wanna be Satan phrases. Indeed.
Characters weak. Story... What Story.
It seems like a bad C horror version of the original The chilling adventures of Sabrina is a good series with many faults.<br/><br/>The most missed out oppurtunity is salem. He started ok-ish in season one with some badasserry, but in season two we see him 1 minute through the whole season. Why even have him in the show when he does not do anything else than hiss? He could be doing cool stuff in shadowform if you dont think he fits the "horror tone".<br/><br/>Otherwise did it seem like season 2 was rushed through. The ending was not satisfying at all. I hope you get the act together in season 3, because this went from an 8 show to 5-6 real Quick. Sabrina is an out of control teenage half witch who seems to get the better of, seemingly, powerful witches with little effort. Her character is uninteresting and predictable. The story line suffers because of her limited motivation and limited acting. The production value is an asset. The supporting actors are what saves this series and the writers would do well to spread the plotlines to them because Sabrina and her obession with her whining boyfriend Harvey and her need to make things all roses and sunshine is getting tiresome. Very good !! Exciting opening for the next season... cant wait for season 4 !!! And please we need season 5 & 6 too üò≠üôèüèº Nice style. Great sets. Decent acting.
Plays the woke card verry VERRY hard.
LGBTQAI community represented fully.
All -isms are adressed & bested.
Serie will surely find its audience in this time and age.
But could have done it all a little less hamfisted. First of all I watched the 1st season and I loved it 8/10.....Yes there we're hidden political propaganda yet went over my head.In the second season it's like the political correctness propaganda is forced upon you.This is a supernatural series not a series in regards to gender equality,Transgender issues and women always being the victims of toxic masculinity.So I got about half way into the second season AND stopped watching it.The Show needs to keep on the supernatural storyline as was once watchable.
PS. BLUR background effects in the series SUCK!!!! Season 1 kicked off a really interesting world of witchcraft. The battle between the main character and her fight against fate was very compelling. Season 2 continued this but lost a little steam due to some repetitive storytelling but was still quite engaging. Season 3 is a complete joke. Almost seemed like they got new writers. It's full of Hollywood's political correctness and some truly ridiculous events. Also, if you are easily offended by offhand talk of the devil and devil worshipping then this series is not for you. However, season 3 is really not for anyone unless you are a Hollywood PC drone. I saw first two episodes and I'm ameized. Truly the best new tv series on Netflix. Perfect release date choice. Love Sabrina and other characters they are really well written. I Like that this series has a dark take on the story.
I can tell everyone who hasn't decided if it's worth to watch. It is definitely worth it!!! I was expecting it to be amazing , but it still surprised me! Love it What a shame that the creators decide to focus on being politically correct than actually building a story.. if you can ignore the 30 mins of tripe around the unlikable and unrelatable supporting characters like "Theo" for the 15 odd minutes of actual story per episode then go ahead and watch. Much like alot of Netflix's original programming it sucks you in and then starts forcing it's political correctness down the viewers throats.<br/><br/>Season one was enjoyable
Season two was atrocious. Why did it have to turn an anti-white male show? Every white male character in this serie in the 2nd season is either dumb, a puppet or evil. Why suggest themes like gore, debauchery and canibalism if you dont use them? Why did it had to be about feminism and gender change when magic is wide enough as a theme. Greatly dissapointed about this and when i wrote a comment about it to Netflix they said; if you dont like dont watch, we arent political and wont interfere in the creation of the authors. I asked have you watched it before putting the netflix brand to it? If yes you are political. I cancelled my subscription. Ever since buffy the vampire slayer and true blood ended, i have been waiting for a show like this, that will be fun to watch, it is NOTHING like the Sabrina comedy that used to be on TV (thankfully), they twisted it around and made it brilliant, dark yet funny and enjoyable.
I loved the whole dark twist that was given to the show and my favorite character was aunt Zelda who was brilliantly acted by Miranda Otto.
Also the style of the characters, the wardrobe and red lipstic all made me want to dress like that and be so stylish :)
i watched it twice (both seasons) and fully recommend it to anyone who loves shows about withches, magic and supernatural things. My favorite of all was the christmas special The story itself is great. Unfortunately, they distract you with silly SJW story lines that don't add to the story at all. For instance, there is an episode that would lead you to believe they are pushing a pro-feminism idea, only to turn around and say that a female character is now a trans male. I'm all for doing what feels right for you as long as you don't force your beliefs on others, but that episode could have been perfectly fine without that final twist. It almost seems self-defeating to what they were going for in that episode.<br/><br/>SJW politics aside, the story is actually pretty good. It is a rather dark adaptation of the sitcom from the 90s, but in a good way. The acting may not be the best at times, but the story line keeps me interested enough to want to find out what happens next. Looking forward to a third season. Season one was a bit preachy - as to be expected by liberal Hollywood - but season two has gone into full blown propaganda mode. This puts Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will to shame for sheer propaganda but nowhere near as artfully done.<br/><br/>They demonstrate so clearly the true racism and bigotry of the liberal in America. That those things and form of intolerance are completely verbotten unless directed at the white male, in which case it's not only fine apparently, but actively encouraged. This is perfect demonstration of the Orwellian nightmare that is the PC/SJW liberal groupthink. At virtually every turn there isn't a moment when they're not pushing the extreme left agenda and railing against white men as all categorically evil and insane - even the angels of Heaven are painted as white, almost exclusively male, evil and mad. It's both breathtaking and completely appalling in its scope. Shame on Netflix for funding this extremist left-wing hatred. I'll be cancelling my subscription if they keep this up. A great balance of teen angst and horror, the chilling adventures of Sabrina, is a must watch on Netflix for anyone looking for a good laugh and a good scare. Combining all the great characters from the original with the new dark story it creates the perfect balance between the old and the new. I loved the 90s version of the show but this reboot is just terrible.<br/><br/>Here are a few issues:<br/><br/>1. They keep pushing feminism and "girl power". They say women should rule the world. "The future is female" I am a moderate woman and I am tired of hearing about it. The future is for everyone on planet Earth.<br/><br/>2. Besides point number 1, the show is way too political. They are pushing every new and trendy PC, intersectional topic out on the market today. They are pushing these topics just to push them. They don't even have a large part to do with the story. I have no problem with any type of person but when you add these issues just to virtue signal it is so cringeworthy and annoying. This is a show either for the 90s fans or current teenagers. Teenagers are too young and impressionable to be taught politics but Netflix and the 90s fans already deal with politics enough in the real world.<br/><br/>3. They say an awful lot of things that have to do with worshiping Satan. I tried to ignore this but it makes me uncomfortable and after a while I had to stop watching. I don't remember Satan worship in the 90s version and I think it is unnecessary here. What's up with the anti girl conversation, feminism, gender identity politics in this show? Someone needs to learn to write. We live in a time when many TV series are influenced by political correctness. This show is unfortunately one of them.<br/><br/>Among the positive aspects, is that the show has good photography and better direction. The music is well placed and the atmosphere feels right.<br/><br/>On the other hand the script is terrible. Most of the sequence is due to forced drama. In addition the forced misogyny ends up tiring the viewer causing the protagonist to become a Mary Sue that only fulfills her feminist agenda.
It is not bad to dedicate a chapter to address issues about political correctness, however the whole series resorts to this mistake.<br/><br/>Finally I want to clarify that I think that the first season, despite their mistakes, ended up being balanced and well achieved. However, the second season lacks sense and logical sequence, especially in the last episodes.<br/><br/>For me it's a 5/10. I am at episode three, but honestly, this is an awful series. Based on its score here I thought it's going to be another great Netflix show, but it's not, not even slightly. The acting, the story line, how it was written and directed. It's just terrible. Especially the acting part. Sometimes it's even ridiculous. I am going to suffer it trough but not happily. I gave it 2 because of the cat. What has Netflix become. This show (like all their recent releases) is just awful. Trying to push a sjw agenda is bad enough but Sabrina is just so unlikeable. She's supposed to be a"good" witch but everything she does is for her own gain. Then there is the special effects that look like a child designed the demons. I just can't put into words how bad this is. It's like they took Harry Potter, Buffy, The Addams Family, Hammer Horror, Mario Bava, Riverdale, Heathers , Dark Shadows, Veronica Mars and yes, HAXAN and put it all into one tv show and weren't afraid to go DARK AS HELL with it. Not what I was I was expecting and I couldn't be happier about it. There are genuine thrills and chills scattered throughout the drama, as well as some stand out comic moments (especially from the Aunties).
So much thought and production value went into this series. Special shout out to the costuming and set dressing, as they really help define the characters and setting to a beautiful degree. And the cinematography & lighting is occasionally downright genius.
The cast is top notch and straddle the right line between melodrama and camp and humor, while still retaining a solid core character work to be built upon. I particularly love that they got crazy talented, sophisticated, gorgeous middle aged women to play the vampiest, most seductive characters on the show. Michelle Gomez and Miranda Otto are KILLING IT and you can probably expect about a billion drag performances based on them in the upcoming year (which is the highest form of flattery in my opinion.
Yes, the message(s) of the show are very progressive and maybe occasionally a little heavy handed, but also there is subtlety (I mean, who are the white hats in the show? Everyone has a bit of nuance to them). Sabrina is no one note goody-goody. And the message of the patriarchy fearing women with both freedom AND power? I couldn't think of a better time for this series to debut. Enjoyed it, people take things too damn seriously though Yes, bible thumpers. This was so well paced, such a rich character development over the whole first season... I ended up caring deeply about these characters - both Satan worshipping witch coven members and mortals. That's saying something, considering I'm older than most of the actors in this show... then again, no stick up my arse and no bible stuck to my face.<br/><br/>The supposed politics in this show are non-existent. There are a few mentions of the issues between a couple of female characters and the jerks in their lives, two of whom happen to be male.... these mentions are lightly used & sprinkled throughout about THREE of the first 10 episodes - plus they are used in a personal way, pertaining to the characters personal situations. This isn't a soapbox BASH you in the face political agenda, and the main focus of this show is the character and plot development. HAIL SATAN, witches. ;) Mostly propaganda for satanism, gender confusing and (dark) magic. All nature has been here destroyed. Not good... I would not advise any (especially young) people to watch this. We REALLY wanted to like this. But this show is wayyyyyy too feminist/man-hating. Apparently it's okay for females or "transgenders" to lie, cheat, & steal but heaven forbid (or I guess it's hell forbid) a male do... well... anything. In this universe, all men are in the wrong & ignorant. NO THANKS.<br/><br/>Also, the makeup artists need to be fired! Everyone's makeup just looks wrong, especially Aunt Hilda (her face is mustard colored, matches perfectly with her mustard sweater). Seriously. REALLY BAD. If you hadn't noticed it yet (are you blind??), you'll notice it now.<br/><br/>It's all very disappointing. We enjoy darker stuff & had been really excited about it. Big fail, Netflix. I'm really surprised that people didn't like season 3, especially because i loved it even more than the other seasons. There were plot twists and unexpected things going on, unlike most of the shows where you can predict everything from the first episode. What really feds me up is that people tend to compare teenage shows with shows with adults in them, so if you don't like teenage shows just don't watch them. Sabrina is a teenager in this show and she behaves like a teenager, she's not supposed to be acting and thinking like an adult.<br/><br/>Beside the musical parts, I loved everything else. I totally recommend this show to people who like teenage shows with a bit of sci-fi snd mystery. Can't wait for season 4! Though the characters are based on Archie Comics and the previous Sabrina TV show we all know and love, this show's plotline is refreshingly original. You don't ever see what's coming, and this new Sabrina is a badass warrior. I have no idea idea why there are so many people writing bad reviews, unless it's just for the sake of complaining.<br/><br/>Sabrina is an excellent series. I finished the two seasons and I really loved it. Season 2 sucks, quite boring, ofcourse season 1 was boring as well but it has it's moments I would easily give this show a 9 if I could actually see all of the episodes. There are just too many scenes that are damn near pitch black. This seems to be a new trend in many shows and it needs to stop. I really liked this show, until they decided to cram an obvious female character being allowed to change in the men's locker room down my throat. I don't understand the bad reviews. This is based on a comic not on the 90's show, it's not a dark version of it, but it's own thing.
I love the main actress, and most of the cast is pretty good. The story is funny and dark, and Sabrina is the typical knows little of her powers and her story orphan character, that the more she finds out the more she learns of her importance and her powers.
The dialogues and themes are pretty witty and relevant, and I've been enthralled and seen all episodes so far and can't wait for the new season. I started watching this show when I was bored and my colleague suggested it to me as a decent show.
I love the idea of having a mix between the 50/60's, but some modern ideas thrown into the mix. Clearly a town that did not move along in time.<br/><br/>I noticed the references to the other netflix show Riverdale and could appreciate this.
Though around episode 4 you start noticed they put a lot of pressure on the whole " women are strong and man are all bullies " there is only one 'good' man in the whole story and that is Harvey. Something's happen and he never less and less 'good'. Beside that you suddenly have a girl wanting to join the males baseball team?? She is 1 meter 40. This is just stupid, but of course her friend the witch swing buy and enchants her. She makes Susie, my apologies Theo now after the game a god/goddess in baseball.<br/><br/>In the hope she gets selected for the team? I think? The next game she well suck again though...and probably gets more backlash, then what she would have gotten if she would have failed from the start.<br/><br/>I disapprove of this show promoting transgender stuff, cause people with these issues have serieou problems and they are so light-hearted about this in the show.<br/><br/>Well beside this. The show is entertainable. They made a wrong choice for having Shipka as the lead character portraying sabrina Only reason I'm writing this is in response to everyone who is up in arms about how this show is 'shoving pc culture down their throats'<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and read them all then give this show 10 stars to counteract there BS reviews Granted, I'm not that far into Season 2, but I'm just bored. This makes me SAD because I felt Season 1 was my guilty pleasure. It was just addicting, and I ended up lauding its praises and watching it a couple of times. I thought it was surprising and cute the way they took Christianisms and reversed them, i.e. "Praise Satan." I kind of like the whole witch sentimentality, and I felt a new world was being created. I love new worlds.<br/><br/>But Season 2 is kind of a disappointment. I liked all the adult characters for sure as well as the Weird Sisters and Nic Scratch and the cousin in Season 1, but they just aren't being used well in Season 2. They are kind of pushed to the background and made less dimensional, as if the writers decided old people and bad people are boring. I feel like I can tell the actors are annoyed with their character non-development. Nic Scratch is too much the nice, doting guy (blah) and Madame Satan/Lilith (whom I had a major crush on in Season 1) is written now to be a bit petty. Also, I agree that the PC elements that some are referring to are not really done well. Susie/Theo as a character is just a bit too immature for me. (But I get that young transpeople might need a good story of a truly young person discovering the self). I don't think the character of Sabrina has even in Season 1 been my favorite manifestation, but they have made her even brattier and more juvenile in this season. Ros is still a bit cool and beautiful, but she doesn't really have her own story anymore now that she's smitten. Harvey is just Harvey. I don't expect much from him. He should stay in the background. We need some nuance and sophistication. But maybe this is because I'm an adult and the writers decided they made a mistake and needed it to be solely a teen show. It's like Season 2 is trying to backtrack. But people liked it because it wasn't just for teens. I mean, if you want to make the show touch on LGBT issues, give it to the adults. We all want Lilith and Zelda to get together. Show more of The Weird Sisters. Make Sabrina a lesbian. It's like the show went high on political issues but also high on hetero-couplings. Season 2 is regretful, confused, and misdirected. So far. But I don't know if I can watch more to see if it picks up. Shame on you, bad writers. What about MY needs? I've seen both season and the Christmas special thing. And normally shows like this aren't my style but Sabrina is worth the watch. Don't listen to the snobs on here that wanted it to be something different. It is a very dark drama/thriller that really comes to life in season 2. Where as season one had a more episodic feel with a behind the scenes over arching story in season 2 the main story was founded in episode 1 and kept all the way through. There are twists and thrills. No scares really but it's good entertainment. Passable acting bordering on good acting. Passable writing with some cringy jokes here and there and your general "why would you do that??" Moment is gonna pop up as with 99% of these types of shows.<br/><br/>Reading the reviews on this I tend to think about other Netflix shows with similar style that were indeed terrible (cough, hemlock grove, cough) and think why am I seeing similar statements? I almost feel like people didnt watch the show at all.<br/><br/>Bottom line, don't expect action and scares. Don't expect high octane. Expect drama, some decent dark humor, some thrills and suspense and above all some pretty freaking dark themology. It's worth it if that's your type of thing. I have no idea what happened with this show, starting with episode 11 of season 1. Its a show of epic proportions suddenly. It got SO much better in season 2, its dark, thrilling, completely CRAZY and absolutely hilarious at the same time. I love this so much. I haven't gotten far into this show, but it's really hard to watch because it's so dark! Every seen is practically pitch black, and even with all the lights off I can't see what's going on Don't sit your kids down in front of this and expect this to follow on be alike the tv series, nasty shock haha ! Based on the graphic novel this dark adaptation is brilliant - delivers all and more - can't wait to further get stuck into it! I wanted to like it but thanks to all of the PC bullcrap and agendas, the show sucked so bad and will not make it another season for that reason alone Saw the first 5 episodes and I can say it is good, very good in fact. I found it Beter then original Sabrina of course it is a lot different then the old one. But In my opinion horror fist it lot beter to Sabrina then only comedy. So can't wait for seeing the rest and for season 2 Omg this show is sooo bad! The main actress is so terrible and the default gay black guy because equality??.. sexualizing supposed teenagers yet the theme is men are bad. I'm a woman and this is a big yikes!! Really glad they renamed this at least because it's a mockery of the original series. They remade Charmed, and Nancy Drew and ruined those too. Pls Hollywood stop!! I'm a lover of dark TV shows, and movies particularly anything with a Burtonesque vibe. From the promo I thought this might fit, I liked the atmosphere of the show, and the premise.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the writing is terrible, thinly veiled misandry to the point that it's actually offensive. Seriously, whoever wrote this has a real chip on their shoulder. The older cast members are actually quite good, but the whole cast of younger actors are at best universally annoying and cringey.<br/><br/>The title character herself is one of the most unlikable leads I've ever seen. It's like someone found a way to distill pure smugnorance into the format of a "faux-woke" t.v. show. Preachy, annoying, dull. I skimmed up to episode 4 and couldn't take it anymore. I can't remember exactly when I realized that I knew what was going to happen before it did in these episodes but that's when it's time to let go and move on. I tried to fast forward, stopping at points that looked interesting (they weren't) but I never made to the last episode. Very disappointing. Mediocre at best. Dialogues are cringy. The writers obviously inspired by different religions and mythology, mashed everything together in a blender, and threw the resulting pulp on to a plate. It would have been fine if the show didn't take itself too seriously, but unfortunately it does. I am not sure what is the target audience of the show, but quite a few scenes in every episode are mature only in my opinion. I won't get into details (just to avoid spoilers) but parents should be aware that there is blood, violence, soft core explicit scenes, partial nudity and similar activities. The cinematography is OK, if you ignore those intetional blurry shots, at first I thought my TV was faulty, but thankfully it was just the "artistic" touch of the director. Atrocious. The art and make-up department on the other hand did a high quality job, well done! The acting is hideous, apart from the 2 actors that portray the aunts, everyone else is just like a wooden plank floating in the ocean, no direction, no purpose and completely useless. I'm all about this show! I would love to see Netflix release its third season on Friday the 13th this coming December. They should do it as a "Nightmare Before Christmas" theme. I would be living for that! 7.7 is completely underrated for this show.<br/><br/>It feels like a triple A, high budget show, with an amazing attention to detail from the outfits , the carefully crafted environments like Sabrina's House or the School of Dark arts, to the church, the woods.<br/><br/>
Everything looks believable , eyecandy and again, feels like a triple A experience.<br/><br/>The cast is so masterfully chosen , and they all do an amazing job.
Look at me with a straight face and tell me you don't love Ambrose, Hilda or Sabrina herself. I bet you can't !<br/><br/>The fact that even the bad guys of the show create a feeling of "It won't be the same without him", proves that you have a stellar cast in your hand.<br/><br/>-----------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Let's talk about the arguments of the very vocal minority in here. The show at a score of 7.7 , and the Reviews of this show has an average of probably 3/10.<br/><br/><ul><li>Bad acting</li></ul>If you say that the acting is bad unironically you shouldn't be watching Movies or Series period. Or just stick to Marvel stuff.<br/><br/><ul><li>Human Side-kicks are under performing and they don't add anything to the story</li></ul>I sort of agree with that point, the idea is great, the execution not so much. Personally it doesn't bother me though<br/><br/>-No story. Nothing is happening
If you also unironically say that, you shouldn't be watching TV shows.<br/><br/>People (including myself) love shows like the Supernatural , for a reason.
Not because we are waiting to see "Who will sit on the Iron throne" , but because we love watching the characters in different stories, settings, adventures. It doesn't have to have an extremely elaborate story for it to work.<br/><br/>But even if you don't agree with that, the argument that there is no story is bad by itself since actually there is a story. I can't even sum it up because anything I say about the story is Spoilers, so again, if you unironically say "there is no Story", you shouldn't be watching TV series, for the two previously stated reasons. Watched original Sabrina as a kid and now I suspected it will be similar. But, this show outrun my expectations! It is simply great. I was always the big fan of True Blood, horror style and dark story but with the just dosed taste of horror and creepy stuff, not too much, not to spoil the show. This is my new favorite tv show! I am so delighted because in the begging I was little scared that Sabrina would be like too good and then it will overtake the show, but I watched till the end of season 2 and every episode is so good without any remarks The best witch show on TV. Not too fluffy, teenagery...there are real dilemmas. It's not for kids though. It gets dark and there is some sexual content. So good! First time ever reviewing something on here. I'm a huge fan of the comics that inspired this show. I'm a huge fan of Riverdale. And I'm a huge fan of progressive ideas that challenge outdated social norms and push for equality in every possible sense. But christ, the first episode of s2 is UGLY. Apparently all men are scum, end of story... Really?<br/><br/>It's ok to be angry at social and sexual injustices. In fact, it's good to be angry cuz that rage can be channeled into change. These issues need to be addressed, no question. But dismissing an entire group of people (and it's not like we're talking about white supremacists here) is the complete antithesis to the very agenda this show trying to push, which I ASSUME is equality and acceptance.<br/><br/>There's tons of other cool stuff going on CAOS, and I really want to love it, but as a dude, I don't even know if it wants me to. Total misfire. Came to Netflix to be entertained..left with an overdose of "down with the patriarchy" narrative All the hype and plus Netflix banner made me watch this boring and mindless tv series .Why in the hell I watch this .Please I request don't waste your time. First season was a blast. The acting was rough at times, but that cast is too great to care! Season two is 10x better. Lots of plot holes and predictable most times, but all the actors' character development and progression in acting quickly made this one of my top favorite shows. Can't wait to watch it again! As a story in general the showbis great. But the inaccuracies are not only degrading and disrespectful towards witches of the world, but even smaller things like Yule being the night for spirits is annoying. There is so much research that needs to be done and fixed, but it will never happen. Witches have never had anything to do with the Christian God or their fallen angel Lucifer. It is simply arrogant to lay such claims. That like refering that Christians honor Krampusbfor the Winter holidays. Please do more research and fix the wild accusations and inaccuracies. Or simply stop referring to them as a Witches. Overall it's a very good show. Watched every episode in one sitting.
2 things bothered me however in the show that gets kind of old with today's tv show.
1) Why do you need to bring up politics in everything. This was mainly addressed in the first episode, but throughout the rest they don't really address as much as they did in the first.
2)Salem doesn't talk in cat form! This really bothered me since in the original show he does and his character was always my favorite.<br/><br/>Other than those two things the show was pretty good. Another thing about the show is that, other than the names in the show, nothing was similar to the original. Not sure if this is what they wanted to accomplish since this is a "darker" version of Sabrina the Teenage Witch.<br/><br/>Overall though I'd recommend watching this. I'd give it a 10 if it weren't for those minor issues. I'm old enough to remember the 1980's tv show which I loved and hurried home from school to watch. This is so much darker and definitely not for children. I never read the comics so cannot say if this interpretation differs from them. I understand the claims about there being an "agenda". It has a number of non white characters and a gay male character and so on. So what? The world has moved onand who cares if some closed minded bigots are upset about inclusion?This is a very enjoyable, darkly comic guilt pleasure for those like me are old enough to be doing more productive things than binge watching Netflix.
The acting is very competent. Esp the actors playing Aunt Hilda and Ambrose. I was surprised at the 1950's style aesthetic, but it adds to the quirkiness. Can't wait for season 2 I've already become invested in the show and its characters. This is yet another shining example of Hollywood ruining everything. Let me be clear you dumb Hollywood scumbags. You are nobody's. You are there to entertain us. Tell good stories and provide an entertaining escape into fantasy. I don't want your BS political and immoral views preached at me. You've destroyed a fantastic horror story, made it blatantly nonsensical, completely deviated from the story altogether in many cases to push your personal BS, political and immoral disgusting views. The most satanic journey you would see in the tv show, beautiful dark photography and Sabrina is still charming as the 90 's one. Great for a rainy day! A little corky, dark with a good storyline different from any other versions of Sabrina I've seen. A continuous story episode to episode gives this show a natrural flow. Love it!!! Dark!! Wishing for more more more more episodes and seasons!! Love this new show because now we can all handle dark shows and not complain about it. I love the diversity of cast and all the new LGBT characters. It is time for a change. This show definitely tells how it is and some folks too stubborn for change. My satan be with you hhaha Very entertaining, totally immersive. Would be a travesty if it doenst get renewed for a second season. Don't go in head first expecting a a Sabrina, The Teenage Witch - that's a sitcom. This is a horror/drama - and a premier one at that. Convincing performances from literally every actor in the show; I have no negative critique. One of the worst shows on tv with a truly irritating lead character. What the hell happened to the 2nd season? Really? Winning by cheating? I am a fan of pc culture but this is just too much, not watchable at all, and it has lost all the dark from the 1st season, it feels like a kids cartoon now..... meh There are tons of reviews from Sabrina the Teenage Witch fans who can't get it into their head this is NOT a remake or a continuation of that show. These shows are based on two entirely different source material and are only related through the characters themselves appearing in both. The story, the setting, the plot, and THE AUDIENCE are completely different!<br/><br/>With that aside, if you take this show as it is - a NEW show it is excellent. The production value and acting are great, the plot is good and the series keeps you wanting more. Enough said from a decent to great Netflix original right? Give this show a chance and watch a couple episodes and you'll find yourself wanting more as long as you aren't a biased millennial who wants to poorly review this show because it doesn't bring back your nostalgia.<br/><br/>Girl Meets World is a perfect example of a terrible reboot that is surviving because of nostalgia and fans from Boy Meets World. Disney brought the show back, added a feminine twist and brought back the original cast. They wanted to remake the series and have it survive off the popularity of the TGIF sensation back in the 90s. That is NOT what Netflix is attempting here. This is a fresh take on a NEW comic in the "Sabrina universe" and you'll either like it because it's horror or you'll hate it because its horror...but get over yourself "Teenage Witch" fanbase and reserve your comments and reviews for this show only and not by comparing it to a "lighter family show with a talking cat". I watched part 1 and i watched 1,2 episode in part 2 and i don't watch the continuation of the series.Part 1 not bad teenage serie. I really like it! It's a little dark but I don't mind. Looking forward to part 4! The story line is not that superior.... It doesn't meet the fantasy context!? Also characters act like they are forced to act. Much overrated Netflix series Decided to watch this since I watched the original. Such a disappointment. Sabrina is self-centered spoiled brat. Her character irked me so much I couldn't finish the series. She always has to be the certain of attention and have things her way down to her being disrespectful to her aunts who raised her since birth. She does whatever she wants to do and thinks she knows more than anyone else. I can't believe they reduced Salem's role to just a house cat that doesn't talk. I really like this series but it is let down by some terrible acting. I listen (rather than watch) scenes with Sabrina in them to avoid her melodramatic facial expressions. Someone needs to pay for a really good acting coach to fix the problem. Overall I like the story lines, season 3 had a bit too much going on but I would still like to see a season 4. This is nothing like the old Sabrina - this is so much better! I love it more by each episode. It is very horror-like at times and it has some comedy in it as well. Give it a chance! I highly recomend it! I very happily watched it, but it seems schizophrenic. Doing evil to do good. Hmm. And sometimes we are supposed to agree and appreciate it. Hmmm. And somehow, the equating of witches and Satanists seems so very puritan. I have a degree in literary analysis and I MUST say that the guy who wrote this has some serious issues. It was painful watching this! No fun at all, awful, shallow, tortured writing! Tries far too hard to be cool and stereotypes galore! The styling is great but other than that.....BLAH!!!! This show has potential. The problem is, it's trying to push some ideologies in a very hamfisted way. I'm not against stories addressing issues or having ideologies. A good story should have a message. But in this show they are not integrated to the story. They are more like an afterthought.
And besides no one wants a lesson on morality from satanic witches with cannibalistic rituals. Season 1 was really good there was a solid story and and the acting top to bottom was really good. It had some political and social issues but they were not overly polarized and more of a secondhand plot in the story.
Then starting within ten minutes of season 2 the political and social issues become then main focus of the story. Every straight male character except two are stereotypical misogynistic and or racist jerks. It becomes straight men vs women, transgenders and gays as the main focus of every single episode. A show that had heart and felt real is just ruined by the typical Netflix writers insistence on forcing transgender and anti straight white male politics.
I left it at seven since I gave season one a 9 but season 2 gets a 5 but if next season follows this one I probably will not watch it all. Season 3... Wtf?
The show doesn't know what it wants to be: teen horror? It's not really satanic, not really wiccan, somewhat highschool musical, somewhat adult entertainment. Whatever they were going for, they missed. I grew up reading the original Sabrina. But this is so much better! I hope they make many more chilling seasons! Was enjoying this even though for teenagers, due to the fun and plenty of adult actors to entertain as well. But part 3 dragged me out of it. The show has now turned into an utter soap opera, with kissing and sexual tension scenes every few seconds, as if that's what I should care about most in a fantasy witchcraft show. I never liked soap operas, even when dressed up as adventure fantasy. I'm sure this will improve it for the reality tv, soap opera loving audiences America has honed, though.<br/><br/>Five out of five for this third act loss of identity. It has ups and downs, some episodes are quite boring while some others really enthralling.
Makeup and special effects are really poor IDK what happened... season 1 was spectacular. Season 2 was good. Season 3 though?! I almost wish I never watched it. The stories and plots were just... a mess. I only watched all the episodes because I was so invested in this show. I guess, just like Riverdale, it loses its cool after the 1st season - yikes!! I had to go back down to 4/10 stars after a stupid musical number or two. That poor actress (Kiernan) deserves better than this s**t writing for what she's putting out there. I thought the first season set up for some pretty good stuff to come but the second season is just stupid and the non-human characters are extremely cheesy. Listening to them speak takes me back to Skeletor from the age-Man animated series, which was great when I was a 9 year-old...
Kieran is still great as Sabrina but she's the ONLY thing that doesn't suck in season 2. If it weren't for season 1, I'd give this 4/10, but I'll go with 5 for now. This will have some spoliers ahead so been warned<br/><br/><br/><br/>
I've got to say when seeing the first season I was loving it, a darker grittier verson of the beloved Sabrina, when season 2 came around it seemed to have kept track .... right up intill the end when Sabrina proclaims that they are going to hell to get her new bf back which i get but doesn't really fit in with what she promised the "new leader" of hell. which is one of the problems with this show, deals with the devil or the leader of hell are always broken, its almost like the writers were saying people should have power with no gain for those who give that power to that indervidual.<br/><br/>Which gets even worse in s3 where Sabrina sends souls to the wrong places , demming them not worthy of punishment, even though they made a deal with the devil.<br/><br/>In all this show does live up to its name, the only problem is that these chilling adventures are no more chilling then the orgianl. I have loved the series through season 1-2, of course there were some flaws before but it was very enjoyable before and very much the vibe I was looking for. Witchy, dark but witty and a little bit teenagy at the same time. Great for someone who liked shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, The Vampire Diaries and the Original Sabrina TV show (of course very different and more dark but I believe enjoyable for that crowd). Anyway, this season just was not able to hold up to what the two seasons before were like.
I see that most reviews bring up the musical aspect and I completely agree. The show did not need this!!! It felt unnatural, cringy and betrayed what I believed the show was before. Though, I did not love this season there were a lot of interesting and fun parts but the ending was very unsatisfying and uncharacteristic of Sabrina.<br/><br/>BIG SPOILER
A major issue/plot point in the final episode is Sabrina needing to go back in time and fulfill the promise she made to another Sabrina that had come from the future. Sabrina was meant to take the future Sabrina's place in order to not change anything in cycle of time but of course she doesn't do that and instead does something utterly stupid. See, I understand if this was Season 1 or early Season 2 Sabrina, who kept thinking she could find loopholes in magic and get everything she wanted without a price. Which was annoying in the earlier seasons too but a part of her growth, and in the late Season 2 and Early Season 3 it seemed that she had learned her lesson and grew as a character. But the ending of Season 3 completely erased that and made me question the integrity of the writing for the character.
Overall, there were soo many things that could have been done better and I feel should have been thought through, like bringing back Dr.Ce felt like a cop out and we as the audience lost as opportunity to see Hilda grow more from her grief and her shame making a better arc for her character development. But NO we have to make A HAPPY ENDING for everyone cuz thats what we want. Not like we were happy with a season ending with the main character's lover being stuck in hell...no definitely not.<br/><br/>Anyway, there could be a chance that the next season (if there is one) has a sufficient way to fill this concern...like maybe some of Lucifer's residue got into Sabrina's blood stream but I don't know if I would be satisfied by that. Who knows. For me its a better take than the original & what a cast..from shanka as sabrina to the dude from true romance being her principal, The woman in acid house her teacher, Jeffery dahmer is her boyfriend an aunty from the office a priest from pusher etc etc..dialogue/storyline is a bit wicker a bit rosemary and a little charmed with a nice Sabrina darker then ever twist, the cgi and jump scares at a top shelf level, so all in all a very good series and well worth a watch..A Very solid 9/10 Sabrina's terrible acting coupled with the shows terrible script is an excuse of a show. Season 3 is as bad as it can get.
Nick complains about the torture of hell - like where did he think he was going? Heaven?
This whole Satan and witch mixing story board is so off in so many ways and terribly written and produced. SABRINA IS THE WORST!!!!!! She thinks everything she believes is the truth. And everyone must believe what she believes. She wants to join the witches because she likes the power but doesnt believe a thing they believe in. LEAVE THE WITCHES ALONE they're happy without you and your dumb ideas! Shes sooooo whiney and preachy this show is extremely difficult to watch. Season 1 was good. It started out a little dark and scary which I loved then became high school musical. Season 3 was so painful to watch and was very cringe and annoying. Also Salem the cat is pretty much non existent. Ghost in Game of Thrones season 8 has more screen time then Salem does in all 3 seasons of Sabrina combined. I'm still hopeful for the show but not sure if it can be saved. I really enjoyed the first 2 seasons but 3 has started really badly and the writing so far seems very weak üôÅ...hoping it gets better üò≥üôÑ I don't know where to begin with part 3. Part 1 was good and enjoyable while part 2 was darker and more serious (but still good). Part 3 is a total crap show and the story line makes zero sense. It's all over the place and I nothing makes sense the entire time of part 3. I honestly was hoping at the end of the show she would just wake up from a dream sequence and be like ohhh what a nightmare. The show's portrayal of hell is laughable and looks like some crap you would see at a high school play. Lilith is weak considering she's suppose to be the first witch and she just lets 16 year old Sabrina up and take her thrown. The trails Sabrina has to do are beyond stupid. They haven't been solved for thousands of years but Sabina just goes and finds them in 1 day. I wanted to punch her anytime she mentioned Nick. She finally got the balls to stand up to him in one episode but then reverts back to being stupid. Apparently there is only one coven in the entire world. When they call for help, like 4 other witches show up. Don't even get me started on the whole time warping monster in the egg. This whole season is a mess. It's like they gave the script to some middle schoolers and were like here, give us a story. The pagans had zero explanation. I mean Circe and Medusa were part of that group and they had no background or explanation of how they are still alive. Pan the great nature god gets killed off by a simple stab of a sword. There's also random musicals through the show that are clearly just stupid and pointless. This season has made me lose hope in this show. Great show, fun to watch. And the cast is great. The story is great....only thing I greatly dislike, the constantly have the characters do stupid crap. I don't know how many times I get frustrated because sabrina does something stupid and your going WHY?? why would you do that. And this 3rd season whats with all the singing. Its stupid. But we still watch cause its a good watch. While I binged watched the series and really enjoyed it, it's far from being perfect. I guess I just fell in love with the dark tone and dark humor of it. To be fair I wasn't expecting the series to be this dark. Cannibalism, orgies, murder..this was unexpected, but I enjoyed it a lot.<br/><br/>What I did not enjoy is the way the feminist message is handled. It's too obvious and "in your face". The way they bring the subject, made me feel like the series thinks its audience is stupid. For exemple, the series constantly feels the need to tell you how misogynistic something is by having the character say it over and over again. WE KNOW! We get it. Look at the movie Zootopia to see how it's done right.<br/><br/>There is also a couple of unintentionally bad messages in this. One good example is a part of Theo's storyline. All of a sudden Theo (who's transgender) wants to play on the male basketball team. Now, never prior to this have we seen Theo show any interest for the sport. This makes Theo looks like he just wants to play the rebel. The message would have been so much stronger if Theo actually had a passion for basketball from the start. Then, the coach bring a pretty good point, regardless of his gender, Theo is small, frail and is not good at the sport. Now you'd think that they would show Theo work hard and train to prove the coach wrong, but no. Sabrina just use magic to make Theo good. So maybe Theo could be mad at Sabrina for doing that, discovering he didn't earn his victory. But Theo is actually happy about it. What a good message! If you are bad at something, no need for hard work, just cheat to achieve your goal. This is just one example, but there is a couple more things like this in the series that made me cringe a little bit.<br/><br/>Overall I didn't hate it, but it could have been so much better, if some subject would have been handled better. I don't think it deserves the many one stars rating it have, but I don't think it deserves the 10 stars either. (I haven't yet finished this series; I'm only a few episodes into it. And... this is a bit of a rant. Sorry.)<br/><br/>I found this show on Netflix and, being into the whole witchy theme, thought it'd be something interesting to watch over the summer. It started as, and has remained, a good show, until...<br/><br/>'Praise Satan.'<br/><br/>Really? The entire thing's so clearly written without any research at all into the subject of witchcraft and the witch trials; it's almost as if it's trying to make you think that the people killed at Salem deserved to die.<br/><br/>In reality, covens of witches, including those still running today, do not and never have worshipped Satan. This is an Abrahamic idea, and one not acknowledged by witches around the world.<br/><br/>I've read some other reviews to find that the show includes exaggerated accounts of human sacrifice and cannibalism, which were both, again, false information spread by early Christians to scare people away from the culture.<br/><br/>If this type of thing was put out regarding more popular religions, the backlash would be unimaginable.<br/><br/>So, this could have been really good. I don't mean any offence, though I've probably missed someone off, I just think the writers should've had a little more regard for sensitive subjects. I can say, they sometimes got a good performance but certain scenes some of the performance a look cringey, but its a little bit okay. The most problems in this drama is they got a very lack of CGI budget. Almost all two parts have a little scenes where you barely seen they using SFX effect. If they could do it like charmed series, this could be fantastic, but they diminished my hope. Its nearly looklike my favourite Sabrina, but not too close. I hope for the next part they could do more justice on using special effect, boring without it, this is witch drama. Okay, I literally just started watching this. It started out... Eh. Then as it goes on it just got silly, like really silly, and dumb. Honestly the source material was campy and fun, with laughs and fun moments. Salem is awesome in the original, in this though Salem is basically a prop. Which is ironic, the whole 'hipster aspect' of the show is kind of a huge buzz kill. I can forgive bad writing, bad characters, even horrible plot points and padded writing. The bludgeon of political inconsistency and "real world" issues, is just a little overbearing. Through watching I've read a few other reviews from other outlets and some of them say this show is the second coming of Buffy, which is so far from the truth you need a map to find it again. It's lack of knowledge in how the 'secret religion' works is very abundant. It's 'pranks' are that of a Tumblr bloggers fantasy, it's over all message is muddy and bland at best.<br/><br/>To finish this off, Zelda was a fun character in the original, in this she's annoying, Hilda was plain awesome, in this she's timid and bleh. Sabrina was curious and a loose cannon, Sabrina in this is about as expected as you get.<br/><br/>Over all 3/10. Chilling Adventures of Sabrina is one of those compositions where it is better to lower your brain activity to minimum and not to ask questions. What year is it? How does black magic work? Why do witches establish contract with Dark Lord? Why witches are afraid of the Dark Lord? Why do world-threatening events involve only ten people and one small town? The answers are blowing in the wind, so hard to catch. But even you *do* catch them and are close at fixing logical holes left by the writers, another wrecking ball will destroy all your hard work. The wrecking ball is the plot, the plot which is nothing but a stamp on a stamp irrationality mixed up with tolerance absurdity and empty threats intrigues. The only trait distinguishing Sabrina's script from some cheap children cartoon's is the presence of story arcs (though who does not have story arcs in adventure fiction nowadays?).<br/><br/>Aside from meta plot there are two other positives that kept me watching somehow. One is the visual style: beautiful dark-toned picture, decorations reminiscent of the XIX century folklore tales. The other is, curiously enough, actors. Given such a horrendous script, most of the cast did a splendid job with it, Spellman family especially. Concerning controversial Kiernan Shipka, well, I liked her portrayal of Harry Potter-like impudent upstart "chosen student" but these exact qualities are what makes her extremely annoying for many others.<br/><br/>Also I should warn you that silliness of the Chilling Adventures of Sabrina is swelling with time: part 1 was OK, part 2 is not even funny anymore and the premise of second season... Ha, maybe I will even watch it to see how far will they go. Good luck. Tons of plotholes, bad acting, and poor decisions on budget allocation. So I was excited for the new season until they forgot the plot and made the show about lessons on gender equality and man hating. This is a feminist wet dream and a pathetic show now. Shoving their beliefs and liberal bull down everyone's throat and no longer care about the plot. Pure trash. Cancel it already! Leave it to Netflix to turn a great 90s show into a steaming pile of horse feces. This show is realistic they don't hold anything back. It's refreshing to finally see a show that's not afraid of anyone protesting about religion, politics, animal welfare ,or sexual content. I am totally impressed with the writing. You are sucked into the story and you literally feel like you were living it through the eyes of Sabrina. The actors and actresses are amazing. Way to go !!!!!!! I wish that more shows were made just like this fantasy is fantasy and please keep up the good work don't ever hold back you guys are all true artists and it shows in every single episode of this show !!!!!!!!!!!!! Utterly amazing amazing amazing amazing. Thank you for being such a great artist all who are involved in the making producing and writing of the show. I was a bit leery when this project was announced. But, they've captured a much darker and gory atmosphere (than that of Riverdale, Sabrina's sister show) that resonates pretty well with the graphic novel of the same name. If you're looking for something similar to Melissa Joan Hart's version; look elsewhere. This will not be your show. Definitely not like the original tv show, which is good. I am enjoying how dark and ominous everything is and the cinematography is lovely. I emphatically recommend giving this a watch, the entire season. I absolutely loved this season along with every other season. Me and my boyfriend literally binged this whole season and the whole time were at the edge of our seats. Never once were bored. Not sure that everyone with the negative reviews understood the plot. ... and enjoy a dark, fairytale-like series, with a nostalgy punch from the original comic. I couldn 't help myself binging every single season, as the plot climaxes keeping you on the end of your seat. So just ignore them and give Chilling Adventures of Sabrina a try. Its such a mess in 3th season that i culd not finish it...so so bad Yeah, Its a cheap wb show with mature themes. That fact doesn't make it mature. Overdramatic and not captivating at all. If you are over 18 and enjoy this show, more power to you. You can have it all to yourself. I really couldn't believe all the negative reviews. I don't take tv that serious. And maybe that's why I enjoyed it. It's very different than the original, so if you're completely attached to that one- you may be disappointed. I am eager to see what seasons 3&4 bring. Worth a watch! For a show that was greatly anticipated yes some parts it does drag but then you get the parts with all the magic and the creatures. Watching the original Sabrina had me skeptical but this version is just as good I used to love the TV show when I was a kid and even though I knew this was going to be geared more towards a female audience with a feminist vibe I wanted to give it a shot. I like the idea of it being a darker version and it's at times a really good show but it always slams the breaks on with its Liberal views. Yes I get women can be powerful, yes I get there's nothing wrong with being gay, yes I know there are transgender people who should have the same rights as everybody else so stop banging it home every chance you get. I tried to watch this show but it was just so evil. I'm fine watching witches/ wizards stuff where the protagonists support good. But in this show, everyone is satanic. I found it very disturbing, especially since it was in a teen show. All that to say, I didn't want to continue watching it and I didn't Holy Mistress of Satin..Season Three has turned to crap. So far writing is horrid and they have freaken made it into a stupid musical. What idiots. Started off at 9 stars, but...:
S1E7 brought it down to 8 stars for Sabrina being stupid (you'll see why)
S1E8-E9 brought it down to 7 stars for Sabrina being a spoiled princess (and girls say boys are stupid...)
S2E8 brought it up to 8 stars for psycho Sabrina snapping some necks, and Theo killing the doubles
S3E1-E3 brought it up to 10 stars with the intro of hell, and some higher power, the old gods of terror or something, very interesting. Don't listen to the negative reviews. They obviously don't have a fun bone in their body. I can't wait for Season 3 and 4! Catholic curious & initially concerned<br/><br/>I was curious to see what this show was about so I started watching it from series 1. Being a Catholic, I did have an unnerving feeling about this series seeing as there is a large aspect of it that appears opposed to monotheistic religion & the Catholic faith in particular.<br/><br/>
Glimmers of hope<br/><br/>However, there were things that I thought might be glimmers of hope regarding putting a kind of 'holy' twist to the series. For example, it is indicated that Sabrina's character was baptised as a child at the insistence of her mother. Also, it is clear that Sabrina is confused about the dark side of her inherited 'faith'. Furthermore, in the second series, it does appear that the adherents of the 'church' of night are confused as to whether they need to revise their religious beliefs so as to not follow the dark lord, after they banish the dark lord to Hell in an attacking way. It is clear that the adherents are actually afraid of the figure they worship which seems extremely strange & confused. In the first series, there is even a hint that Sabrina's father might have had dealings with the Catholic church in the Vatican.<br/><br/>
Hope thwarted<br/><br/>However, the second series seems to unravel to become something even darker than the first. There is confusion over the nature of angels where they are portrayed as being evil (by definition angels have to be good). Additionally, I found it extremely worrying watching Sabrina possessed by an evil spirit forcing the angels to recite a prayer to Satan. There was no kind of condemnation of such an act in the narrative. The hint that Sabrina's father might have had dealings with the Vatican evaporates in the second series when it is revealed that he actually had dealings with an underground Satanic 'church' residing at the Vatican. The notion that young Christians & young Satanists could have a party together, knowing each other's beliefs, seems absolutely ludicrous and I really don't get how Rosalind can think it could work.<br/><br/>
Comedy?<br/><br/>I also don't get how the creators of this show can call it a comedy. Many of the dark things aren't funny one bit. The constant use of terms such unholy this & unholy that isn't funny at all, doesn't make sense at all, & gets irritating after a while.<br/><br/>
Could have worked<br/><br/>As a journey in religious faith, this series could have worked. However, the series itself suffers from confusion from it both putting forward the idea of there existing an objective good & objective evil, whilst at the same time, the Satanic faith that many of the characters profess, seemingly putting forward the notion that there is no objective evil & no objective good.<br/><br/>
Acting<br/><br/>The acting was fine apart from Kiernan Shipka's acting which I thought could have done with improvement. I saw her acting in Mad Men which seemed fine there but perhaps that was because she was a child actor back then.<br/><br/>
Final words<br/><br/>I would say that the creators of this series were extremely brave & creative. I've never seen anything like this before, and they have burrowed new artistic terrain with this show however, the show itself isn't good enough in my opinion. **Spoilers ahead**<br/><br/>Was this good? It was good, but it wasn't great. I loved Sabrina The Teenage Witch growing up, and I expected this to be a spin off from that. Totally was not! This is very satanic as everything is dark and worshiping Satan.
Sabrina breaks up with Harvey and ends up with some guy named Nick?!? The entire time I kept hoping her and Harvey would get back together. I'm almost through with the second series and it doesn't look that way. Dumb!
The other "figures" (Satan and anothers) look as fake as fake can get. It was literally painful watching how horrible they looked.
If you're looking for something like the Sabrina that Melissa Joan Hart played, this is so far from that!
Not bad, but not great. Forced myself to watch the first series and finally started the second. The feminism is repeated constantly. I'm all for equality but it's just taken too far and too often. Clearly the writers can't find any new topics to explore. Best thing netflix can do is cancel the show. It's a really great show. Dark, funny and beautiful. If you are into occult and dark aesthetics like me you will enjoy it for sure. You will find many familiar names in it. From Lovecraft to Dorian Gray, from John Dee to Malleus Maleficarum and many more.<br/><br/>I truly like that the show doesn't take itself too seriously and I suggest you to do the same and you 'll have a great time watching it. You will find some historical references about witches and occultism but don't forget it's based on a comic book and the purpose is to have a good time watching it like the good time you would have reading the comic book.<br/><br/>I think almost everyone of the cast is a great choice. I was surprised because most of the times when I start watching a show it takes a little time to get used to the characters. But not on this show! I felt like I already knew them from ep.1.<br/><br/>For some people who say that the show talks about "politics", I want to remind them that acceptance of the others is not "politics". And to them who talk about the feminist moments of the show I want to say "Really?". It's a show about witches, join the dots people!<br/><br/>Overall, I think it's a perfect show if you are into dark aesthetics like I said so watch it! Kudos to Netflix, you landed a smash hit :) The acting is excellent by the great international star cast, which is studded with familiar faces and also new talent, and direction, production, cinematography, and effects are flawless. Be warned, yes, it does poke at religion of any confession. The serious atmosphere presented makes for wonderful tongue in cheek humour in little dialogue morsels you need to watch out for. It has complex brains, which is so badly absent from many other network productions. Here is finally a series one can watch at any age without being annoyed and insulted with eternal "diet" brain farts. Aside from having enough gratuitous violence, gore, and sex to keep it interesting, all that "juice" is actually in good balance with story content and tastefully executed. Like a gourmet dinner, the spices are well balanced here. Lovely! This is apparently a reboot of a 90s teeny-bopper show, which I can dimly remember as yet another waste of my evening time, but the resemblance is fortunately by title only. This new series does not cater to the"ha-ha" sit-com crowd. Instead it has grown up. Be prepared to take some dives into scenarios resembling real life, dealing with psychology, society, and politics. There is a lot of dark humour beyond reach for those only used to watching light fare. Couldn't think of anything to improve :) They need to make every episode lead up to the season finale, add some momentum to the show. First season was good, I mean second was too, but it wasn't pretty boring until the last episode. Seemed like every episode had nothing to do with each other. In spite of all the sad muppets and review bombers that appear to be leaving some totally incredulous comments here. The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina is extremely popular and much well-liked show.
And it is obvious from the very get-go that it is not like it's very predictable bubblegum wrapped, clich√É¬© riddled, whimsical predessor.<br/><br/>There is much too like about this new version.
And Netflix have yet another major hit show on their list. But just to repeat that some of the people leaving negative reviews here, really are laughable, and extremely petty at that.<br/><br/>Sabrina is not aimed at kindergarten children ok.
And this new version isn't afraid to just be much more darker and grittier. It's also been well-filmed and it's got plenty of jump-scares.
It's also just so visually arresting.<br/><br/>Netflix have produced a show which is both extremely on trend and that appeals to a far wider fresher audience. If you're hoping for Sabrina the Teenage Witch save yourself the disappointment, the only thing this series has in common with the original show are names. The writing is awful, characters not only go from undecidedly "Hail Satan" in one scene to "Lucifer is evil we need to stop him" 5 minutes later, but are also unbelievably moronic. Some characters are so pointless they're given filler lines that contribute nothing to the scene because the writers couldn't think of a better way for them to not stand there and say nothing. Beyond that, there's a menagerie of virtue signaling and liberal pandering, teenage gay sex orgies, and exaggerated weird gothic costume and makeup design.<br/><br/>Oh, yeah, and Salem is just a normal cat that doesn't talk. Just very gripping, involving TV. I put it on thinking it was just gonna be My Kind Of Thing but near enough my entire family ended up watching it as well.<br/><br/>I'm sure the reviews section will be plagued with men complaining about it because it's full of women yadda yadda yadda, contrived reasoning, general whining, you know the score but it's seriously involving TV and I'm absolutely along for the ride! As a critic wrote, "I like to be able to see what I'm watching." Massive fan of Sabrina love the dark twist on this yes agree parts are abit boring big plot holes but this series has so much potential, needs better actors mainly and more big characters and Salem needs to be in it more he is essential to Sabrina but I quite enjoyed it. Ok so I just started watching this show and I really like what I'm seeing Sabrina herself is quite spunky and very beautiful the show hasnt got scary yet but its moving very fast and I love it so far anyway Stop crying for the music and dance. If you are talking about the fact that they sing for the spell casting then you are wrong about hating the show. Chanting means when witches are telling Magick words by singing. This happens in real life(both pagans and Satanists). About the cheerleading? What? Because they sing again? For having fun? Part 3 is literally fantastic, I finished part 3 in 2 days and *gasp*. Waiting for part 4. Also, the special effects are SPECTACULAR. Wasn't sure what to expect going into this like was it gonna funny like the original & I am SO GLAD it's not. This series is brilliant and the writing and acting will have your jaw hit the floor. They go there. & When I say there I mean the one Lord all witches and warlocks worship and it's dark. so if you're sensitive to that this probably isn't gonna be your cup of tea. Its no Hill House, but still spooky good I'm not going to lie, the blurry effects made me kind of dizzy but overall I really liked it. I loved the LGBTQ+ representation. It feels good to have a show with characters you can relate to on a personal level. Everyone talking about how heavy it is on "politics" and "propaganda" obviously has a problem with freedom of speech. This show is it's own show. It's not made specifically for you. If you want a show specifically for you, write it yourself. The show has no leg to stand on. Witches do not believe in Satan, we do not serve a "Dark Lord" We have a code and they did say it on the show "And it harm none do what ye will." The Problem is from the beginning I don't see Sabrina following that code nor any of the other witches on the show. Frankly I find the show offencive to my religion. It's like an amazing mashup of Riverdale Stranger Things and Wynonna Earp then taken and remixed by the worlds best writers To preface, I'm not a Witch nor a Satanist, just an Atheist who studies religions/beliefs as a hobby.<br/><br/>I really did enjoy this version of the Sabrina story, I like the atmosphere, the characters, and the story was largely well done. However the way it represented both Witchcraft and Satanism is woefully inaccurate and outdated perception of both of the beliefs. I would go as far as say that it crossed the line a few times and came across as offensive to those who believe in those religions.<br/><br/>Witchcraft has nothing to do with Satanism for a start, Satan is the invention of the Christian religion. Witches largely do not follow Christian believes preferring deities from older traditions like the celts, greek, egyptians etc. Witches do not believe in pure evil or good but rather see everything in shades of grey. Furthermore contemporary Witchcraft (and most forms of older Witchcraft traditions) do not partake in sacrifices or demons or any evil practices of any sort. In fact I would say it's a very loving, caring, peaceful belief system that strongly advocates not harming anyone, doing all they can to help the environment and their communities, and who highly value taking personal responsibility for ones actions (as in thoughtful about what they do). Witchcraft was wrongly demonized by Christians for hundreds of years and that's where almost all negative stereotypes of Witches comes from.<br/><br/>Satanism again has nothing to do with Witchcraft and originates in Christianity. Satanists can be divided in two main groups, one Theistic, the other Atheist. Atheists often become part of the Satanic believe system as an opposition to religion and in the US you will often see the use of Satanism to protest other religions overstepping their boundaries and trying to merge religion with the government.<br/><br/>Theistic Satanists are the people who truly follow the teachings of the Satanic bible and it's leaders. You could almost describe it as Christianity but in reverse. There's a lot of diversity within Satanism and it's quite a complex subject. I'd suggest reading into it for those interested. Generally speaking however, most Satanists do not partake in animal/human sacrifice or other offensive rituals but rather simple believe in freedom of expression, sexuality etc. you can Google their tenents and you might be surprised to find out what they actually stand for. and how they are not at all the evil group Christians would like to portray them as.<br/><br/>Overall I liked most everything else about this series and I would've given it a 9 but I had to take off the 2 stars because the misrepresentation of both Witchcraft and Satanism is irresponsible and offensive. I am looking forward to another Season but I hope the religious elements will be more thoroughly researched and better represented. This version of Sabrina is amazing! It's dark but not too dark for teens, it's got way better effects, cinematography, acting, and well everything. Don't get me wrong the old Sabrina was cool, I just lost interest in it after 13. This series I would have loved just like Buffy and Supernatural. It's got grit! Great idea, but poor execution. The show is definitely lacking budget with these poor cgi. Also, the show is getting really disgusting with all its mainstream ugly feminism, especially a susie-boy girl, just awful. Sabrina on this show is nothing like the original TV series but I without a doubt think it's brilliant! The cat doesn't talk but it's like Sabrina can hear the cats mind and is very different but I absolutely love it and hope for the next season to come!! Thank you for this show!! :) This fantastical adventure is a home run! Deliciously designed. It's the Sabrina tale fans have waited decades for. Comedic horror with very fun and interesting plot twists...as well as having characters that are not typical of this genre. Certainly a show that keeps you on your toes. Scary, but not TOO gory.
Perfect timing for Halloween! This show is so amazing. First of all, the dark, yet cozy atmosphere is so fun and nostalgic. Secondly, great characters and acting. I honestly feel that Sabrina is a protagonist that is so well rounded, not perfect, yet perfect. All the supporting characters are also so interesting. Thirdly, great plot. Honestly, can't wait for the second season. If you like dark, magical, taboo shows, watch this. The cast did an amazing job bringing this character to live there was no dull moment. If you want to watch an entertaining show, this provides that. I hate reading reviews where pretentious people pick things apart. Just shutup already no one cares. You'll enjoy the short time you watch these episodes, better than a lot else out there. This show is by all means not perfect, no new show is. CAOS is messy in certain areas. The editing could be better; from scene to scene. And they could slow down on the blur effect. It did get annoying. And lessen the political messages - not everything needs to be political. And the writing and acting is a tad stilted. But like I said, every new show is messy at first.<br/><br/>This could be something cool if they do it well. I really don't get why there's some hate on this show, it's absolutely brilliant! Great acting, characters and chemistry, amazing storylines, wonderful sets, and some darkness added in to keep you on your toes. I couldn't stop watching them once I started, I had to keep on going.<br/><br/>Just sit back, watch and enjoy. . . More like this please ! Love it, perfectly cast and smashing atmospherics. So many haters have to be so picky, instead of just delighting in the escapism. It's comicbook, enjoy! Good and even better than Riverdale.Waiting for a crossover and waiting for the actress who plays Sabrina Emmy's nomination. I can't stop watching this show, and I didn't even think it would be good. If you liked Riverdale you'll LOVE this! I don't write reviews unless I've watched the whole series, or at least 1 season. This is not the show for you if you don't like dark, uncomfortable things. The witches belong to the Church of Night, which is Satanic in nature, but it doesn't mean the show is glorifying Satanism. In fact, it's the opposite; it's showing how whatever religion it is, it comes with rules and problems and very questionable things.<br/><br/>Sabrina is apparently one of the few or only half-mortals in the witching world, so she brings a unique perspective. She empathizes with both sides, and it drives her actions. She's not a genius, and she's only sixteen, so of course she makes stupid decisions and screws up, and thinks things will always go in her favour. It doesn't, and the show highlights that her decisions has its consequences, and as we follow the show we realize these decisions are leading her down a dark path.<br/><br/>I didn't really get any vibe of there being a political agenda either. Sure, Sabrina goes on this feminist rant at one point, but is it propaganda? Nah, it's just a modern teenager getting angry that her friend is getting bullied. There is very little talk of these things in later episodes (it becomes focused on the story). Whoever says this show is wrought with propaganda only watched the first couple of episodes. There's very little of this moving forward.<br/><br/>There's too little back story to fully understand where the story is heading, but I think it's a good first season. It established the characters and the rules/ information about witches. I hope it gets a Season 2 so we can see what happens next. Like Archie comics turned to Riverdale, Sabrina the Teenage Witch changes to Chilling Adventure of Sabrina. A really good watch. At the end of the episide, you are wondering what's going to happen next. 100% recommended. I've only ever watched this show because my wife watches it but omg is this show garbage from day 1, I don't think I've ever watched a show where I despised the main character so much sabrina is just so unlikeable she's so arrogant and annoying in every way.<br/><br/>If I could give one piece if advice I'd say skip the show and read the comic I freaking love this show. Please never cancel it lol Despite some questionable decisions and the wild plot, after 3 seasons this show never fails to deliver in the visual department. The intricate costume and character design, especially in season 3, really adds to the immersion in the story. Above all, the set design is astonishing; all the attention to detail and unique structures really pays off!!! The efforts really shine through in the latest season in terms of the set of hell throughout the season and plant overgrowth later on.
Even if you aren't a fan of the storyline, you should still stay for the beautiful sets, costumes, and cinematography :) I just finished season 2 and I was surprised by the ending in a good way. But throughout the show I couldn't stop losing interest and toying on phone or by doing other things. This says a lot to me when something just can't hold my interest. Good try, but a miss for me in a lot of ways. I think it's great show. First season is great. The seconds season toward the end had me on the edge of my seat. Some of the Dialogue is corny. But the story telling is great love the actress. Love it! Great style, very teen-drama-y and even though I cannot stand this genre I make exception for this series. Kitschy, unique, fun and a bit sexy. This show was an entertaining watch and absolutely perfect for spooky season. The show doesn't need to be like its predecessor to be good. It's provided us with a great story and cast to bring the characters to life. And stop being mad about Salem. For the tone of this show, a talking cat would've thrown the whole thing off. Clearly the best thing since sliced bread.
A must view. I did not expect orgies, throat cutting, and cannibalism. Did not expect such a dark take on witchcraft. This is not your 90's Nickelodeon sitcom. I am not familiar with the comic book source material (which apparently takes place in the 60s) but its modernization was probably a mistake. The social justice subplots feel completely shoehorned into the script as if they were added in the final rewrite. Feeling completely underdeveloped and tacked on, they operate at a caricature level, add nothing to the plot, and go nowhere. The tone and themes are all over the place. Much of the mortal/witchcraft tug-of-war conflicts are so one-sided that the season-long choice Sabrina is tasked to make ultimately suffers in terms of drama. A lot of the rules of the world are also unclear, making the consequences unclear, weakening the drama. But aside from all that, 90% of the show worked well enough that I watched all 10 episodes. Congratulations to the producers. Rebooting an iconic series was a risky job, but the producers did an excellent job. The atmosphere created by the director is good, the script is good, the music is extraordinary and finally the acting is incredibly good. Cast selection made extremely well.Kiernan Shipka may be born to play this role. I love what they did with the series! Can't stop watching Wonderful actors and acting! The story was written out really well, can't wait for the next season!! Good good good this shiw is amazing, seriously stop comparing woth the 90 old stupid sitcom. I think this is very good. Actually better than the old sabrina. Cant wait until the next seasin Out of nowhere she decides to be a cheerleader, suddenly there's musicals and the amount of plot holes in the writing is embarrassing.<br/><br/>Season 2 was good but it's will lead you up to dissapointment. I can't believe the writers did the show like this, what a shame. I loved the first season, and liked the second. BUT, after watching the third season, I can say I'm not a fan. They ruined a lot of the characters, and it reeked of 'riverdale writing' which I'm sure, if anyone has watched any of riverdale past the first season, they know what I mean. The story was set in the first season, and it was great. It continued to be pretty great in the second season and the ending of the second season made me really excited for the third. However, it has taken me this long to watch it because I watched the first episode and couldn't bring myself to watch anymore until now. In short, loved the first two seasons but by the third, the show is ruined, at least for me. This chilling and much darker take on that quirky, light-hearted tv show of the past gets better and better with every season. Granted, the first season had its slow moments and there were times where you just had to push forward in order for it to truly get good HOWEVER the show redeems itself as it goes on. Especially with exactly how much darker and unnerving the 3rd season grew to become. The acting is at times sub-par though when it counts, the cast fits very well in the roles they have been given. The writing keeps you engaged while guessing, the plot is filled with moments of light hearted fun in between the bouts of mystery and tension, and overall this adaptation brings a refreshing, modernized, and troubled twist to a classic story. I highly recommend it especially if you're a fan of Supernatural, Charmed, Buffy, Constantine, or the supernatural in general. I enjoyed the first season of Sabrina it was the type of series that I like spooky with just a touch of humor. A little different from the original TV show. That being said the second season is following suit but I am having a terrible time with it. I can not watch it on my TV as no matter what I do it is so dark it is not watchable. I have to watch it on my computer so whoever filmed this I get that they were trying to emphasise the dark but I felt it could have been done without darkening the screen so much. It is rather sad, but the Emperor has no clothes! When are the TV-watching public going to wake up and realise that just because something looks good, and is populated by good actors, doesn't make it good. This is another of those TV series that while it looks (and sometimes sounds) polished, it is actually almost story-less. Walk around being dour and spouting sarcasm, whack in some bloody blood-fests and violence, and viola! We have a TV series! Well, yes, you might have a TV series, but no matter how you dress it up, you still can't hide the complete lack of story-telling ability. Remember Buffy? Remember Firefly? Remember Stranger Things and GOT? Stop thinking your pale imitations with literally no ability to weave a story makes for good TV. You rely too much on the dunderheads of society to keep you afloat. Why not aim high and hire actual storytellers to write your TV shows? Atmosphere 10/10
Acting 10/10
Love it √∞≈∏‚Äô¬£. Hilarious and entertaining. This show is quite enjoyable if you suspense all your disbelief and give into the spectacular of it all. I can definitely see why this show rubs some people the wrong way or is too ridiculous to watch. But if you just ignore all the silliness and just give into the "Hail Satan" premise it's really is well crafted. Everyone's acting is believable despise some of the materials they were handed. I thought there would be a church Jesus groups that would be protesting this show due to the contents. It went deeper and darker than i would imagine but I liked that they went there and basically didn't give a damn, some of it was silly and questionable but it ties together well in season 2. One thing I'm more upset about is the down play of Salem..he's just a prop at this point. One word Netflix.
If you have seen The Umbrella Academy yoy must have love the twists and turns of the show.Season 2 of this show has the same vibe.<br/><br/>Season 1 was all character building.Season 2 had a good storyline,the cgi was better and the acting was very good.They did everything different this season,i love all of the changes from her bad a*s but cute haircut to her abilities.<br/><br/>I also love the way they character development on the characters.Such the unlike able Prudence actually was pretty cool this season.How they gave Suzie or should insay Theo proper development.Harvey is still a sweetheart.Lets not forget about Nick.When i saw him and Sabrina (spoiler) in the trailer i taught that was it.This is gonna be terrible but he was like one of the best character this season.<br/><br/>In a nutshell,be patient with season 1.Season 2 is one of the best seasons of any tv show i have ever seen.Hoping on season will come early next year. When I started watching Sabrina, I found myself being drawn in much further than the simple frightening fun you'd expect it to be. The 'spooky' execution is nearly flawless. It's tongue in cheek but hides it, cunningly adding layer after layer, revealing a surprising depth of character development, given you watch enough episodes and give it the breathing room it deserves.<br/><br/>Sabrina herself is an obvious high point, but she is surrounded by an excellent cast that seems to enjoy their roles immensely, putting a sort of permanent smile on my face. I found myself rooting for all of them, even when they were at odds with one another. Or should I say, especially? The more diabolical the schemes, the greater the fun I was having.<br/><br/>The show is somewhere between a darker, more sarcastic version of The Addams Family and a lighter, cooler version of Lovecraft's work, plus a tinge of Shakespearean directing, with one eyebrow raised. The art direction is fantastic, the individual episodes extremely varied (keeping you on your toes) and the dance between good and bad is at times just delightful.<br/><br/>The only niggle I have is with the Dark Lord himself. This is the most underdeveloped character, lacking clear motivation and remaining one-dimensional, which is the opposite of what the devil should be in a eerie tale. This does bring the overall story down somewhat. Thank God his counterpart Lilith steals the show in his place.<br/><br/>If you feel like having spooky fun, it'll deliver and more. Awesome dark twist to a once bad classic. One of netflix's Jewels It still has its flaws but the story's continuation is so much better than riverdales and the direction and the screenplay is pretty good ,I think Netflix even made the brightness higher because I can see the whole show now hahaha...I actually watched it once before but I was bored and would probably give it a 4 then but now I give it a 7.Also it's supernatural so when you exaggerate things it doesn't look as strange as how it looks on riverdale.That was pretty much a comparison because they're by the same creator but this one is so much better. I never liked terror series or movies but I married 7 years ago to a gentle girl who happens to love terror ....in my research to make her happy I happened to get hooked to the appeal of this gender and so .... here I am , writing my first review to express my gratitude for the quality entretainment that this new version of sabrina turned out to be! my congrats to the team that executed a reboot sort of beyond any expectations... that√Ç¬¥s my humble opinion from brazil .... Miguel Mendes This show was great up until the last 2 episodes of season 1 part 1, where Sabrina decides to up and sign the book of the beast, thus making her no longer human and dumps her friends to become a witch. The whole series shows a girl who wants to stay human, and not sign the book that would enslave her, but find her own inner magic, and strength, but that all ends when she is manipulated by the person who is so obviously manipulating her, and signs the book to "save her friend's and the town" when she was already looking for another, non-magical way. She takes the easy way out and gains power, as well as enslavement to The Dark Lord. When you raise a character on a pedastool saying that they are both virtuous and brave, and willing to sacrifice, but then rip that tablecloth from under the table, you're bound to break some dishes. Season 1 is amazing, binged it in 1 day. Season 2 is 9/10. But Season 3 is mess, I didn't even know what was going on. The acting is pretty good tho. I still hope Sabrina's parents are some how alive and they come back. Every day I work on the covid unit and every night I have been coming home and watching this and I have to say- it has really been wonderful to laugh so hard and be so entertained while going through so much stress!
This is a delightful show- pure entertainment, funny and fast paced.
The acting from the leads is really great. There are some great legendary actors in this show- that have been in the business for decades and they are the biggest treat to watch... Miranda Otto ??? Omg! She is just the star of the show - she is PERFECT here. Also the actress who plays her sister is wonderful too. I think they make the show soo much fun to watch.
All in all- don't believe any complaints from people. I think they took it too seriously to begin with. This show is a comedy. It is very loosely based on paganism in any form, and should not be taken seriously ever.
If you want some very good fun and distracting entertainment - this is it.
I can't thank this show enough. Seriously saved me from multiple panic attacks.
It's wonderful. The difference between season 1 to season 3 is so great, they can't even be considered as the same show at this point. It turned from a unique creepy fantasy to a cheap highschool musical. How could this happen?? I like it. It's pg 13 you can watch it with kids. Good characters and good story line. Wiccans don't believe in the existence of Satan, let along worship it. This is a show about Satanists. Always entertaining, with a great story. My favorite The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina' cowardliness absolutely infuriates me. Costume and set designs are amazing - there are a lot of impressive monster suits, dark and gloomy dungeons and everything else you'd expect from a horror story about witches and demons - and if I am to be honest there is some really good acting every now and then, but no amount of visual spectacle can carry a show on its own, not without a minimally good narrative to accompany it, and that is this show's greatest weakness, that it's too afraid to accept the nature of its own themes.<br/><br/>Consider the following, visual example: one of the characters, Prudence, is soon to be offered in a ceremony of ritualistic cannibalism halfway through season 1. She's stoked to do it, because it's a great honor, and because she gets to enjoy all kinds of pleasures before her death, so at one point Sabrina stumbles upon her, almost naked, with a bunch of other witches and warlocks. It's supposed to be an orgy, like the over-indulgent, lustful society they belong to would favor, but the show's such a coward that everybody's in their underwear! That are even some boys still wearing T-shirts! These quasi-immortal, demon-loving monsters are too young to be having actual sex! Nooo, can't have THAT in our teenage drama! This kind of schizophrenic writing is all over the show. It wants to be a grim-dark tale of magic and death, but at the same time it wants everyone to be good and innocent, or at the most a little misguided or confused, and that just shuts me off.<br/><br/>Nowhere is said schizophrenia more apparent than with the main character. Sabrina is half-witch, half-mortal, and the crux of the story centers around her trying to balance both of those aspects, except this show (along with the comic book source) is trying to be more dark and edgy, so the witch aspect features literal Satan-worshiping, demons and cannibalism. The idea is great, don't get me wrong, but the show stumbles a lot trying to deal with it. Sabrina grew up with her full-fledged witch aunts, and had enough of an education to know her way around all kinds of magics, but at the same time she's completely ignorant of the witch traditions surrounding her, so every old custom and cultural practice has to be introduced in shameless exposition fests, and she only ever questions or gets interested in topics relevant to the current episode's plot, just like poor Salem is only ever used to advance certain plot elements and the completely forgotten again.<br/><br/>The wooden information dumps aren't the biggest issue here, it's Sabrina's naivety: whenever she stumbles upon some new concept or event relating to witch culture, something she's miraculously never heard of before, said new information is assured to offend her bizarrely puritanical sensibilities. Thus, she immediately forms an opinion about this practice she has just learned about, vehemently objects to it for the entire episode, and eventually emerge victorious against everybody else.<br/><br/>It's unbearable! She grew up with actual, sororicidal cannibals, yet is this virginal little doll who just wants everybody to hold hands and saunter towards the sunset, and somehow the show expects us to root for her in all her conflicts, ignoring the fact that she's a massive hypocrite! Yes, give her all the powers of a witch, all the freedom and dalliances of a mortal, the ignorance of an audience stand-in and the infallibility of a saint, that's not going to make the story seem boring or stale at all! Give her an Acheron configuration that several characters spent YEARS without solving and she'll open it overnight. Kill her, and she'll only come back with actual super powers and go around resurrecting people. What's even the point of it all.<br/><br/>P.S.: DON'T even get me started on how easily they defeated Satan at the end of season 2, because that was so anticlimactic and pathetic that I'd need an entirely separate review to cover it. Don't know what the hell or heaven they have done to season 3 you can barely go through a single episode without some stupid singing scene! And the way they studio record the track then impose it onto the scene makes it even worse like a dubbed film! The episodes are slightly too long almost all are like nearly an hour long so during episodes your like is this episode ever going to end. Would have be Better to have and extra episode in my opinion. Still an OK season though! BUMMER. The first two seasons of Sabrina were cute and watchable. Fun and all that. But suddenly, S3 is just AWFUL. First, for some reason, they're singing and performing in every episode. They're not so uber-talented that this is a divine pleasure, sports fans.<br/><br/>Secondly, OMG, Sabrina?! WTH happened to your character? She's faced with all these crises, over and over, in S3, some earth-shatteringly important (no pun!), and every 5 seconds, she's complaining to someone "but what about NICK?!" NICK, NICK, NICK...it's as though she hasn't a brain in her head. Sure, she's a 17-y.o. or whatever, but even a 16-17y.o. can see that some things are more important than her Boyfriend.<br/><br/>It's really irritating this year. I wish that they hadn't ruined it. Oh, and of course, I nearly forgot--the ubiquitous WOKE stuff. Of course, the whole Suzie-Theo plotline--some gender-neutral, non-binary stuff which we all get shoved down our throats, AGAIN. And again and again and again. I can't wait to see Disney eat Netflix's lunch. Go ahead and keep lecturing me, Netflix. I'm sure that my subscription fees won't matter to you. Where to begin. I really liked this show until this recent tragedy of a season was released. First of the singing. Are you guys kidding with this. It's absolutely irritating. Second, the acting was so forced at times that it's painful. ZERO chemistry between Sabrina and Nick! Last, episode 8 is just a ridiculous joke. The entire episode is ludicrous and cheap looking! Fake ferns and rubber masks everywhere! It's starting to look like Buffy!!! Please fix this tragic error in judgment. This show not only goes a long way to give real witches bad names but most of the main characters are all literal satanists who make journeys into hell. I find this to be ignorant of real satanism, ignorant of real withcraft, and certainly ignorant of the original sabrina. Also the actress that plays sabrina is ugly and needs to dye her damn eyebrows. Overall, while there may be some interesting moments in this overdone Dante's inferno of a play, it is executed poorly, mislabeled, has pirated the name of a beloved childrens show, and is so grossly ignorant of its own context and content that it is insulting to the viewers intelligence (assuming they have any) Season 2 is better than 1. It is a little teenish but has good acting. I like the aunts but the religous stuff and devil guy is a bit weird. It can get a bit over the top. Subrina is great. The first season is so slow and boring. It didn't pick up until the last two episodes. Also, I'm not sure if it was kiernan shipka's terrible acting or the terrible writing of the character that made some of this show difficult to binge. Sabrina got annoying very quickly as a self-righteous, can-do, know-it-all teenager. After seeing the final episode in season one I have to say it left me wanting more.. I wish it was longer. Netflix has done a excellent job in creating a series that appeals to a wide variety of people and you can tell that it's going to be a hit. Their casting of Kiernan Shipka was spot on.<br/><br/>From the very first episode she embodies a Sabrina that is reminiscent of the teen comedy from years ago, the comic, and a darker more mature reimaging. You know her, instantly, and she plays the part to perfection... I'd even go so far as suggesting she was born for the role as she's a natural fit. However, this is not a comedy, it's not lighthearted, and to be fair.. it's not a reboot. So be warned going in. The acting is excellent and it makes you wonder how the established networks can keep missing the mark on so many fronts when Netflix and HBO just keep nailing it all down in intelligent ways.<br/><br/>The other characters take more time to develop but they are likeable and you do find yourself caring about them more by the end of the season rather than early on as their own storylines evolve. The chemistry is there, and I think it will help drive this show into becoming a cult classic.<br/><br/>The minor issue I have with this show (like others) is the progressive propaganda peppering the show early on. It's a little irritating.. but not like the CW's redo of say.. charmed where they went 100% in that direction. This is more of a mixed message that rips it all apart while building it up in a setting that is constantly at war with itself. It's hard to nail down but it's there and in your face early on. So, again be warned.<br/><br/>In the end? It's a series that is hard not to like. Can't wait for season 2. Loving every detail of this twisted version of Sabrina. The girl power is amazing and I would recommend this show to everyone. Great twist on an old show with a Riverdale like darkness and more creepy than most witch themed shows. I thought that only Riverdale was the only show I have love watching ,but man, I was so wrong! This show is amazing. Nobody could have played Sabrina better than Kiernan Shipka. She owns the show and her character. All the actors and their performances are amazing ! Would highly recommend it to watch and waiting for Season 2. Users will always emulate the mob mentality concerning any title, and in recent years the less savvy users have massed together to ridicule any sort of liberal Hollywood tale. This is a story about a satanic witch coven in the 1960's.. If you were expecting a story that relates to conservative, pro-male doctrine you are barking up the wrong tree LMAO.. Satanism has always been down with the system (albeit still run by women abusing WEIRDOS..) Also, if you're looking for a perfect rendition of the original series, please stop. Don't review, it's ignorant. This show is based off an archie comic, not the 90's show (still a fav of mine).<br/><br/>The show is amazing, I'm still on episode 3 but the narrative is exactly what I anticipated. It's dark, magical, and I love "Hail Satan" stuff. I'm into the occult, I'm a woman, it's always been a closed system. Men rule the occult, so this tickles any modern day witch's fantasy. Male reviewers are talking about episode 1 & 2 like the whole plot is about man hating lesbians, when the reality is a small subplot is about a girlfriend of Sabrina, who wears pants to school and is picked on by lettermen wearing buttheads In the 60's, girls were finally given the option to wear pants in public, it's relevant for the time period thriller. Get over it.<br/><br/>Mob mentality was big for that decade, and it still is today apparently. Anyways, the story is honest, and I don't find it offensive that the coven Sabrina's family belongs to are servants of Satan, it may not be wholesome, but it's good entertainment. Witches and magic has been historically recorded as a "female" sort of thing, although a true student of the occult knows otherwise...
I look forward to finishing the season and I hope Sabrina gets her wishes. Best show ever.....it's worth time guys...was waiting for this to be out for ages and nw it's here and it's prettyyyyy cool Netflix best, I'm I love with the show but I see that people say it's a 1 or still at bottom . To make know this SHOW IS A REBOOT/REMAKE ITS BASED ON THE ARCHIE COMIC CHILLING Adventures OF SABRINA READ IT AND STOP HATING ON THE SHOW. The people who are offended by this show make me laugh. If you feel personally attacked by all the "white patriarchy" talk, you're part of society's problem. Just got done binge-watching the available first half of the series. I was conflicted on whether or not I would watch the reboot of Sabrina since they were turning it into a darker version. When I found out that Melissa Joan Hart gave the show her blessing, I felt a little better. I decided to give it a shot. First of all, the show is not POLITICAL, as one reviewer said. I didn't see anything political about it. I love the much darker version of this show. If you are looking for a funny sitcom reboot, this is not the show. I Can't say much without giving any spoilers away but I will say its a great series, and if you like dark movies and tv shows, you will love this. Not sure why all the hate. Maybe some reviewers thought this was a reboot of the sitcom and were disappointed. One of the best new shows to hit Netflix recently. If you remember the kids series from the 90's, this isn't that! But a much more comic driven and adult version that does not disappoint! I binged till done, season two is too far away! So far, I've only gotten through 4 episodes, but this show is fantastic. As for people saying there's some kind of political agenda...I have no clue what they're talking about. Unless, a girl not wanting to be beat on by guys twice her size is considered having an agenda these days. This is just a TV series, it's meant for entertainment. Wow! This is dark! This Sabrina is like the Sarah Connor of the witching world! She's not going to sit back and get bullied into doing something she doesn't want to do!
I found this powerful and thought provoking. This is a whole new ballgame! The script, acting, production is absolutely flawless! This is a show that's so well thought out that it comes across so magically to the viewers! I actually cannot believe how good this is! This is the first time that I am going to write a review. So, let's start with the cast. I actually believe that they really did a great job in choosing the cast, I mean, I can never think of anyone who can portray the roles those actresses and actors portrayed rather than themselves. By the way, can I just say that Chance Perdomo is so hot? Yeah, he is so hot. Hahaha. In short, for the casting, it's perfect. Next, soundtrack, it's also perfect for me, the songs that were used in this series are really reallt great and dark. Hahaha. The storyline? To be honest, I never read a single comic book about Sabrina. But yeah, I really waited for this TV Series to come out, because I really really love dark things, like witchcrafts and such. My favorite scenes were when Sabrina resurrected Tommy, when they are doing the rituals, I had chills watching it, especially when she killed Agatha, my god, I cried tears of joy. Hahaha. Last one is her transformation. From being be a half-badass half-mortal half-witch to a completely badass witch with her look. I really am hoping that this is tge start of the Weird Sisters and Sabrina's friendship. But the questions I have in mind that I'm pretty will be answered on the next season is that, what wil happen now, that she already signed the Book of Beast? I mean, will she be able to meet her mortal friends and bond with them? What's gonna happen to the twin sister that Aunt Zelda took home? Will the whole coven find it out? And lastly, will there be round 2 for Sabrina and Harvey's relationship? Cause their break-up is really really painful, well, at least for me. Hahaha. That's it. Hihihi. I'm a massive fan of the 90's Sabrina, but this reboot/horror remake is just brilliantly good! Well worth the watch! I'm waiting for season 2.... This is everything i ever wanted in a show. The vibes are very authentic and that shows producers have went the extra mile to make sure it looks like the 60's. Characters are well written and acting is top-notch. I saw great potential in Kiernan since Mad Men. Story goes smoothly and there are a lot of references from real witches and events that have occurred around them which i love. Another great thing is the scenery. There is something to look at at every corner and keeps you wondering what you'll see next. I love the dark side as well which makes it more interesting. I wouldn't have loved it if it was sugar coated. I watched all 10 episodes in one day! I hope they don't spoil it in other seasons like they did to Supernatural. Like most of the Netflix Originals, CAOS is also based on feminism and LGBTQ community. Main Characters are female,it encouraged Women Empowerment,so I'm not surprised to hear that it's popular in teenage girls. Netflix has converted Comic book series into the next level. Sabrina,Aunt Z & Lilith are portrayed very confidently, although no one can miss delicious cooking and jokes of Aunt Hilda. I completed Part 3 as well but the mystery about death of Edward and Diana Spellman is still not cleared. However it'll be exciting or horrifying to see new deeds of Father Blackwood.... I hope there will be even a third season,
Let me get clear why:<br/><br/>First of all its imo one of the best horror/fantasy series of all time.
Besides that Kiernan Shipkan (Sabrina) Fits her role perfectly and she is pretty.
The Plot in the first season seems to be a little to one direction but in the end and in season 2 they fixed it and because of these plottwists im loving it. This series is good. Although, the way that they slove their problems kinda stupid sometime. I have watched the two seasons in two weeks. It is such a good horror serie with drama, action and long episodes. Very original and can't wait for season 3!! It's a very strong, compelling show with realistic stuff in it. Everything about this show is awesome! I can't wait for Season 3 to be aired on Netflix. Know what you are getting into. It's cheesy, it's somewhat amatuer, it's about witches.
It's like Sabrina told in a style of Hercules or Xena. Then add in creepiness of The Haunting of Hill House.
Definitely gets into the world of witches, and that world is dark. They are satanic. But it's lighthearted about it in a way that Sabrina would be. It's a fun show to watch.
Some episodes are slow but it's a show, not a movie. The storyline progresses but not too fast. When things do get intense, you feel it even more. You can relate to the characters.
Don't forget. This is still Sabrina the teenage witch. It's fun, but not boring.
Personally I can't wait to see the new season! It's a really interesting, clever take on the whole "teenage witch" thing.
It's not the 90s sitcom. Salem doesn't talk and the gender and sexuality of some characters is more fluid than in most shows. These see appear to be the core criticisms on IMDb. Don't watch it if any of those things bother you. Reason I'm saying 10 is to counter act the snowflake right .... Getting offended by gender identification...... Imbd scoring is being thrown out by a bunch of snowflakes who get offended anytime a show tries to empower people to live the life they wants..... Get over it and Get on with your life.<br/><br/>THE SHOW: Season 1 starts off ok, bit all over the shop and very cheesy. To the point I had to convince my wife to stick with it. But to be fair toward the end it does get very good. Solid story and plenty of meat left on the bones.<br/><br/>I'm up to ep 2 S2 and wow..... What a start. If they continue like this they could have themselves a top 20 series. Did you spect to see some dark witchery, good acting, faithful characters, and logical plot? Sorry, but no, read the comic, because with this serie you will only find bad acting, propaganda lines and plot (leftist), rushed subplots, and not a bit of dark witchery. I love it! It's so entertaining. It's a teen show in every way, but in the best way possible. The main character really sells the show and I find the writing to be incredibly creative. I see some people absolutely not getting the show and it's definitely not a show for everyone. For me it ticks every single box for what I want in a teen drama. The special and practical effects are quite satisfying and seem to be of a high quality. Netflix has really drawn me to this show and I can't wait for season 3. Just finished Season 2. This entire series came from the Archie comics, but it really has a life and feel of it's own. It's odd this is TV-14. Even with the limited amount of cussing, it still feels more adult.<br/><br/>This series is well done and well acted. It does have the feeling of "High School Teenagers" at time, but when most of the show is based around Satanism, which just seems to be the norm, it has an air of uncomfortably about it. This series has been very dark from the beginning and maybe that's why they don't seem to need much cussing to make if feel like real life. Throughout the series they give you tricks with the English language. All the witches use the inverse meaning to Heaven and Hell or God and Satan which you know sounds off every time they say "In Hell's Name" instead of "In Heaven's Name" and so on.<br/><br/>They are definitely not pulling any punches on the extreme side of religion and seem to have a pretty firm grasp on how to play there story-lines through. Season or Part, whichever you prefer, 2 followed suit with the unknown prophecy that the "Anti-Christ", through not termed that way, would be Sabrina who started the Apocalypse and indeed they even had Lucifer walking around in human form before opening the gates of hell. Again, you get the "Chill" the writers wanted when they added that word to the title. I would say the only part that made me stop for a second and question how believable it was, was after it was over. "Could a 16 year old truly best The Devil?" Well, she is his daughter after all so, it felt pretty believable. It was definitely more believable than Arnold Schwarzenegger running through the streets of New York defeating The Devil with a shotgun.<br/><br/>This series has become one of my favorites to watch. Netflix sticks it out to binge a season, this is full of supernatural story-lines and finally, it comes off darker than you would find in any other Teenage High School Supernatural Drama. Not much "campy" to it. Can't what for Season/Part 3! A devilishly delightful quirky show on Netflix. Ill give it a nine, as this show never gets mundAne or cumbersome. What is it with witches and cannibalism anyway? Why do they insist on eating their own? Don't get any ideas, as this spin off from the Riverdale (Archie) comic series, is a delish delight to entice. What a fright, don't let those goblins bite! Sabrina is now into her second season with a slew of fanboys and fangirls you know. Enjoy, and feedback? Murf Really had a good time watching this. Be aware this is based on the Chilling Adventures of Sabrina the comic book series not the TV series Sabrina the Teenage witch. I can not wait for season two. All our favorite characters are back in this horror occult adaptation of one of our favorite growing franchises. They are all a little darker, and smarter than you may remember from the TV show.
It's very eerie show that at times is a little gory. It's got a Buffy or Charmed feel, but much more brutal and bloody.
It centers around Sabrina who is in those coming of age teenage angst years so be ready for a little bit of teen drama. Sabrina is an intelligent, driven, righteous, stubborn, at times naive in her quest for social justice, and a typical know it all teen. She is making mistakes and learning like any teen or young adult. Sometimes she has to learn the hard way. Overall she is strong character who sticks up for her friends and her beliefs. I really enjoyed the casting choice for Sabrina.
I wanted a little more from Salem. There could be a little more comedic relief to pay homage to the TV show, but for a suspenseful, horror, drama, thriller it's about what I would expect.
What a wonderful unexpected surprise of an Easter egg for me to find. I really enjoy this show. Not only does this show relate to present attributes, but helps young teens. I was on edge at first but as I carried on it was brilliant. Sabrina is a positive role model and does all she can to help the ones she loves. Please give this show a chance, I'm glad I did. I grew up as a big fan of sit-com "Sabrina the Teenage Witch". So i was waiting for a while this newseries and it definetly didn't dissapoint me. Kiernan Shipka was great as new Sabrina and atmosphere was really chilling. It was great to watch. Sabrina really has magic. I loved the old sitcom adaptation of the comics, and Salem was my favorite character. But I love this new adaptation of the more recent version of Sabrina comics. Yes, it is possible to love both!<br/><br/>To those who are decrying the "agenda", sorry for you, sensitive much? Blind, definitely. These concepts are indeed real and still exist and I applaud any medium that takes them head-on.<br/><br/>The only reason I'm not giving this a 10/10 is the portrayal of witches as satanic. Huh, I know several, trust me witch does not equal satanist. Why perpetuate this old stereotype?<br/><br/>The acting and visuals are excellent, the storyline and dialogue is entertaining, and I'm really enjoying watching this show. The show paces itself so well... the characters are revealed to you throughout this first season so that by the last episode you CARE about them. This is something very hard to do now. The plot is thick and rich with SO much material and plotlines to explore and, being that I only watched the first season and there are already so many parts of the show that have yet to be explored... I will not get bored. I really enjoyd this, bring the next season! So, i loved the original Sabrina but this show is so much better! The only thing I really want to point out, because I really never wrote a review, is that this is not, nor was it ever meant to be a remake of Sabrina The Teenage Witch. I don't know why a lot of people here in the reviews think it, because if so, they never actually researched before watching the show.<br/><br/>Archie Comics published Sabrina The Teenage Witch Comics, but later published a new Comic Book Series, called The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, on which this show is based. And I loved the adaptation. In fact, this Netflix production is the first TV adaptation ever of the Comics, and is in no way related to the Sabrina The Teenage Witch series, except for the Characters. Probably, no definitely one of the best shows I have ever watch, I recommend it. It definitely could effend some people depending on if you take things seriously or not. It's such an amazing series. Can't wait till season two!!!! I rather enjoyed this show and appreciated the adaptation of the comic series by the same name.
Just a word of advice if your easily offended by everything don't watch.
But really? most of the negative comments are about " lefties political propaganda".
Snow flakes don't have anything better to do with their time than to be offended and complain about everything? pretty much every tv show, books and all media show blacks, whites, gays, straight, trans, men and woman and everything else in between what's the problem ? Does everything have to be an "agenda" or "propaganda"?
Get with the times and get your heads out of your asses enjoy something for once without getting offended and crying about everything all the time.
If something doesn't go along with your views then don't watch it and move on or better yet stop seeing everything as an attack on you. People seem to be throwing a lot of hate towards the show because of it having a "political agenda". but beyond the first 1 or 2 episodes, these minor elements people mention are no longer even present in the story and were never truly the focus. The show has a dark humor, great supporting characters and a great protagonist in Sabrina. It sits somewhere in between being like Riverdale and Buffy the Vampire slayer. I have finally watched episode 10 and I think this programme is amazing. Love every minute of it. It shows all the good and bad points of being Sabrina. Cannot wait for the rest of the episodes OK now I know there's mixed reviews but as a nice lady from the state's told me forget about the tv series as it's based on the books/comics but I'm 3 episodes in and yes quite enjoying it I am bias anyway and was very sceptical when I saw that another actress was playing Sabrina but oh boy I wasn't disappointed she has really done her proud and the Harvey really compliments his character to this is absolutely brilliant really worth watching I am half way through the first series and already can't wait for the next please hopefully lots more series to come I am in my 50's so not a youngster but I am as excited as a child so I shall be waiting with bated breath for the next series to start if I could give a 100 or even a 1000 stars I would of love to all the brilliant cast Well, first of all this isn't some masterpiece, so i won't rate it 10/10 just cuz it's good, or i am enjoying it. This show is great, i was waiting for it right from the very first moment i saw it's trailer, it got me excited, and i think it's a perfect watch for halloween, it has all the witch, magic and spooky stuff (not scary, it's not horror obviously)
It had a great start, and i think I'm gonna enjoy it till the end, cuz i starting watching it out of interest and not out of recommendation,
I watched riverdale after so much hype and recommendation all around, but i was highly disappointed. Its good show any how you put it. Its a show. That u watch because its good acting narration and fun to watch. If u are too serious about plot drama morals and stuff then it's not for u.
Its a fantasy. Graphic novel stuff. Who cares if story is going off track at times and some things doesn't binds up in the end. Its not Sherlock stuff any way.
I agree to the point they went into Satan stuff quite much and connected everywhere and feels messy some times but its fine for a show like this. So just buckle up and watch.
Cast did a good job. I wish luck for their next season. After i read a bit of the reviews i wonder if we have been seen the same show. This is not the sitcom Sabrina, nor i see political agenda anywhere.
Is a do-over of the Sabrina sitcom in a much darker view, and for me in a much more interesting one too.
Kierman Shipka is a great actress. Watching her in mad men was a surprise. And i start watching this so i can see how much she had growth as an actress . It is a very enjoyable show and i can wait to see new episodes, specials or whatever they release I honestly don't care if it's not the same as the old Sabrina as I use to watch, because this is so bloody good.
I love the darkness, and spells etc.
I don't want to watch a silly Sabrina in highschool acting weird. Lol
But this is great. Must match! Sooo good! Very happy Sabrina was brought back with a twist. The show plunges you into a split world of magic/unmagic and just when you think it's all happy Harry Potter land, you find out your fun "powers" and everlasting youth come from Satan, your aunts enjoy human flesh and your Catholic baptism has power to protect you. It's slick, unexpected, and hilarious. It is darker than other magical shows. Satanism is dark! I'm only a few episodes in, but so far there is no "light" magic. Sabrina's family are expected to sign over their souls. I'm a little surprised to hear Christians have a problem with that aspect of the story - isn't the devil supposed to be an enemy?<br/><br/>But the story isn't preachy, doom and gloom! A lot of family dynamics are happening in its clever writing. I especially appreciated the nightmare episode - what could have been just a filler was used to explore the aunt's relationship with each other: love, inter-dependence, guilt, rage - everything women shove under the rug spilling out just to swept up again with full knowledge that little is really going to change in their sisterhood.<br/><br/>I've seen a lot of complaints about the show's "politics" - have you ever spoken to a teenage girl? They CARE about things! And these characters care! From Sabrina's friends drive to have some affect on their world to the scary "sisters" girl gang social climbing efforts to serve the Dark Lord,all the women are passionate. I have foggy memories of reading my parent's old copies of "Archie" comics and Sabrina always used her powers to get back at bullies and unfair teachers so in that sense the writers are staying true to the origins!<br/><br/>Kiernan Shipka, is a knock-out! I thought she was a passable kid actress in Mad Men and I'm so pleased she's developing her own career! I enjoyed a few episodes of Riverdale, but it was all a bit too many storylines and what felt like adult voyeurism into teenage life. I'm hoping for fewer underwear scenes and more drama, but we'll see out it wraps up! Visually stunning. Great acting, interesting storyline. This is not Sabrina the Teenage Witch. Based on a dark graphic novel. Very entertaining! Don't look for fact in Satanism or Wicca, just be entertained.
There is no political agenda here, it's called moral plot. Worth watching to form your own opinion!<br/><br/>Great binge watch for this season! Not for young children, obviously. I wasn't fully prepared for the severity of this show, I knew it was supposed to be dark, but within 10 minutes of the opening credits there's a woman laying in a pool of her own blood. Ghost children, hanging corpses, ritualistic sacrifice, cannibalism, murder, and even Satan! What makes it fun is that the satan worshipping aspect of the show is played off like any other religion would be in any other show..except with ritualistic cannibalism.
The characters are all fun, unique, and are well developed.. each dealing with their own struggles and hardships and pain. Sabrina herself is complex and struggles with some of the traditions of her existence.
At times, the stories do resonate political: feminism, protest, sexual identity, and racism are a few of the issues that weave in and out of the story, but each have their specific roles in the furthering of the story itself and the development of the characters. But, I do imagine they will tingle the nerves of some with brittle constitutions.
There is a strange focus effect in many scenes, where backgrounds are intentionally fuzzy and out of focus.. I imagine it's intended to force the focus of the viewer, but it can be a bit distracting at times.
Overall, I absolutely loved it.. and "I'll just watch one episode" turned into a 10 hr binge of the entire series and wishing there was more! One of the best horror series on netflix!
I love the new story of sabrina, loved to watch the old one I personally haven't watched Riverdale or the original show and I've seen a lot of people talking about this show and comparing it to the old sitcom, this is not a remake or reboot it's an original idea based on a novel and I did only watch the first two episodes but so far this looks like a promising show, I like the idea and even though the acting isn't the best it's still a good story and it got me at least interest in in what's next. With a stronger central mystery steeped in witchy world building, Chilling Adventures remains a deliciously dark.
Chilling Adventures Of Sabrina is a visual feast. Mastered in 4k resolution with support for HDR. It is shot in a 6k resolution.
Kiernan Shipka is a real talent . Her acting is sublime as Sabrina . While big events overwhelm most of the series, there's still dazzling performances to be seen from almost all of the cast. The series has gained complexity and some interesting ramifications to see moving forward. I totally enjoyed the darker vibe of Season 2 excellent.<br/><br/>In short, Chilling Adventures of Sabrina Season 3 hones in on what makes the show so much fun and amplifies it to it's most ridiculous but oh-so-entertaining levels yet. I've been in a lowkey state of "WTF" ever since I started watching this show, confounded by the morality of the characters and the specifics of the mythology. Season 3 kicks the "WTF" levels into highkey, leaning into its dark, delirious extravagances with the confidence of a shimmy and a bold red lip. It's sillier than ever, sassier than ever, more ambitious than ever, and a bit less messy than usual, and by absolutely throwing the kitchen sink at the wall in season 3, seems to make decisions the same way its lead character does; by simply asking, "why not?" You do you, Sabrina. You keep getting weirder and darker, because I absolutely can't wait to see what kind of creepy-camp clusterfork unfolds in Season 4 I was desperatley bored today, bingewatched 1 serie and 3 movies. This one i turned off after 20 minutes. I could predict all the bad reviews written here. One clich√© after another, i guess it will appeal to teenagers but for adults who love tv shows this is just bring and predictable. I have to say, I absolutely love this well krafted drama inundated with satire regarding the "dark arts" Take a dive into satanic witchcraft and you won't be able to stop. I'm already dying for season two! The casting is perfect. I love the dimension of these characters. This series delves into deeper issues creating complex characters along the way. It's a lot darker than the original Sabrina series so it's probably not suitable for your 9 year old to watch. No talking kitty for comic relief. I found this to be well written and very entertaining. I also think it's very relatable with lots of parallels that young people have issues with today all in all very enjoyable. This show is a much darker take on Sabrina the teenage witch. I really liked this show. The set design and costumes were really on point. I love the references to satan and witches throughout the show. The visuals were really well done. Season 3 was a bit messy with too much going on a one time, which made the quality go down. Hopefully they will fix this in season 4. Honestly loved this adaption of Sabrina.. the cast are amazing (With the exception of the actresses who play Dorcas and Agatha). The latest series (3) was stressful to watch lol but I still enjoyed it all and can't wait for season 4 (and more to hopefully follow. Occult fiction and interests in the occult seem to have a resurgence every generation. In the 1970's we had all the psychedelic stuff and demonic possession stuff, in the 1990's it was films like The Craft and TV shows like the Melissa Joan Hart Sabrina and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and I suppose The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina is the millennial answer to this trend. Stylistically, it's decent enough (although some of it will no doubt quickly become dated). The actors for the most part genuinely try, and even manage to pull off some excellent performances here and there. The soundtrack is nothing special, but it's okay.<br/><br/>Plot-wise, this show is a total mess, and doesn't seem to know what it wants to be. It's campy but in a blatantly unfunny way that takes itself far too seriously. Its portrayal of the occult seems to be trying to shoehorn in every trope it can to the point of being at best annoyingly nerdy, and at worst offensive (they lump in Wicca with witchcraft and paganism and it's all umbrellaed in as "Satanism" - I mean, yeah yeah, fictional stories can take liberties, but they didn't even try here. Its portrayal of the occult in connection with contemporary politics is also nothing new. It's more-so a late 2010's fad that was seen in YA fiction books like The Babysitter's Coven, The Lost Coast, Necromancy Cottage and These Witches Don't Burn, which had their fair share of forced diversity and feminism, as well.<br/><br/>The show's biggest flaw for me was that everything had to be political, but in a way that's neither surprising nor developed. It's not the 1980's anymore, this stuff is old news, and the constant feminism stuff and attempts to try and fit politics into the story was just far too obviously desperate. The character diversity was nice, but it too felt desperate and forced rather than natural. I think we've all learned from Steven Universe and Degrassi TNG that forced diversity can actually be pretty offensive. It's a big slap in the face that says, "no, we couldn't just naturally write a character who happens to represent you! We had to make the character entirely defined by their race or gender or sexuality!"<br/><br/>All in all, now that this show has hit a 3rd season and has now decided it's also going to be a musical (trying to compete with American Horror Story, maybe?), I've lost any hope that it might improve. If anything, it actually gets worse as it goes. The 1990's Sabrina was cheesy but at least it was fun and understood what it wanted to be. Hokey, slice-of-life comedy/fantasy. The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina is all over the place. Occult horror? religious/political commentary? Tumblr-esque friendship drama? Fantasy? Musical? Wow, next thing you know they'll animate the 4th season as a cartoon just to shake things up even further! Maybe they'll rub climate change in our faces or make a few heavy-handed anti-capitalism cracks while they're at it, since clearly they can't turn off the social justice button. I am the son of a pastor grew up Christian majority of my life. This show is what I was raised to be against, yet I enjoyed every episode of this show from a fiction to a non fiction stand point I can relate to these characters in so many levels. I recommend to put all ideas aside and open your mind when watching this show. It is truly amazing and can't wait for season 4 I think Sabrina got the full on witch upgrade she deserves. Whilst the original tv series was enjoyable and is for teenagers and teenagers at heart, this current show is for grown ups and focuses more on supernatural. I love it! LOVE season 1 & 2.
Season 3 had a good story to it. But the (badly sung and written) musical numbers were just cringey. Although, I didn't hate the lullaby.
It felt like they were trying too hard to shove Riverdale into it. Plus the character crossovers... I started watching this show cause the trailers looked really cool. At first, I thought I would get a show in the lines of Netflixes "other" satanic show, the great "Lucifer", but Sabrina has turned out to be something quite different. "The Chilling Adventures Of Sabrina" is decidedly darker and much less comical than the afore mentioned "Lucifer", something that had me scratching my head throughout most of season one. Is this a black comedy? Is this a full out horror fest? While the show has its fair share of dark humor, I would refrain myself from saying it is a "comedy".
Sabrina plays like a darker, more sinister version of "Harry Potter", bearing many similiarities with the Hogwarts wizard.
The first season was a bit hard to get through as I was struggling to find out if this was actually a comedy. Some of the actors seem they are about to burst out laughing or throw in a punchline in many scenes, only to find out they were dead serious about the subject matter! Perhaps it's the association with the Archie Comics universe that made me expect a comedy (I have yet to see "Riverdale"). Young actress Kiernan Shipka is great as the beautiful Sabrina and it was great to see "Lord Of The Rings" Miranda Otto as Zelda, Sabrina's uptight aunt.<br/><br/>The show gets darker and gorier in season two, but it also gets better and better. If there's a show that could challenge "Stranger Things" Netflix's supremacy is this one. Like "Lucifer", I'm baffled why this show isn't more popular but I must admit that the constant use of phrases like "Hail Satan" and all things demonic or unholy might put some viewers off (not me, mind you! I found all that satanic stuff extremely hilarious).<br/><br/>I hope that season 3 catapults this show into a greater the popularity it richly deserves! One certainly does not expect great storylines and deep character building from such a show, and neither the corny setting nor the utter lack of subtlety should come as a surprise. I was fully aware that I was going to watch the lukewarm highschool-drama of Sabrina, mixed with the chilling-ish harry-pottering of Sabrina.<br/><br/>So imagine my surprise when I found myself cowering in front of the TV, closing my eyes in terror and begging for it to stop. Whoever had dibs on the casting couch when it came to the male roles in this made sure that almost any scene with a Y chromosome present would turn this innocent teenie-drama into a show about a dark dystopian future where talent is outlawed and only certified underwear models are allowed to star in movies or tv shows. Listening to them butchering their lines, watching them turning every spark of atmosphere or suspense to ash, eying for the camera with one eye and squinting for the director with the other...<br/><br/>This could be everything it sets out to be, and you have performances like Sabrina's aunts that are a perfect antidotes to the male cast, but there are long streaks in every episode that are really hard to watch. In a good way. And then a lot of pins and needles with all the twists and turns. This is insane. And everything I love in a good series. Great romance and characters grow in their own way.<br/><br/>In this series, we see Sabrina Spellman in a more modern setting. The series sets it tone it to a thrilling but intense pace and you will find yourself rooting for Sabrina.<br/><br/>You will cry and scream. You will be angry. I felt all of this. Don't look at all the negative reviews but focus more on the special sides of the the series. The moments, the magic,and everything in it.<br/><br/>So is it worth watching? Heck yes. The series proves to be a true classic and never strays away from trying to get its point. Watch a few episodes at a time and get lost into the moment. I've come to the conclusion that this series has gotten so many negative reviews because it offends certain Christians who don't like the satanic aspect of it. Reviewers also didn't like Sabrina and her friends being feminists and that it includes a non-binary character.<br/><br/>So to new viewers who are reading all the negative reviews.....just ignore them and form your own opinion.<br/><br/>I think the series is well done and the actors top notch. I can't wait for season three. Suprisingly dull, the entire show is "should I be a Satan worshiper or not..The End" all the ingredients of a new age show with no story at all. Gay cousin, genderless friend, murder and devil worship with no plot or story to even make me click on episode 2..just dark,dull and sad With the screen 60% pitch black, 60% of the time, the "you can only see half the face" school of film is ascendant. This is atmospheric?? You can sense much beauty in the background but no one could afford a lightbulb. Corners ,walls, even mouths, necks, all undeserving of illumination. Every bit as good as those recent films done in the pleasing light of an arc welder... I liked all the actors. I hated all the constant references to the dark lord, satan, the high priest, being shoved at us every 5 minutes. Should have a rating for MA, and NOT let impressionable kids watch it! I liked the Sabrina/Harvey relationship! (That Ross Lynch is a real cutie! üòâ). I wished they would have kept them together.... instead they put him with her best friend, (isn't NOT dating your best friend's ex boyfriend a cardinal rule every girl knows?!?). And I think Ross Lynch is a good actor but they made his character come across as almost a little dumb. Maybe they should of had a terrific 3 way love triangle between Sabrina, Harvey and Nick. That would have been more interesting than them splitting up and him going for her best friend in like zero to 60 seconds! And equally boring is how fast Sabrina 'falls' for warlock Nick, after professing her never ending love for Harvey every chance she got. And the whole transgender thing? I get it, I'm not opposed to it, but it really didn't fit in with this show and the plot/storyline. And it was another thing that was really pushed at us every chance they got, much like the satanism. I know it's a 'dark' version of Sabrina, the teenage witch, but this was way too dark. Especially if you want 13 yr olds to watch it. Satan, Satan, and more Satan!!! That's what this show seems to be all about! They should have called it "The chiling adventures of Satan". I thought all the actors were incredible..... they did their best with what they were given. Salem the cat should have had a bigger presence, and although enjoyable and sometimes funny, why this new cousin, Ambrose??? They don't even explain where he came from. And making him gay? What purpose did that serve to the show? I'm not against gay characters, but it just didn't seem to fit into this story. There was no need for a gay or transgender character in this tv show. And it detracted from the story of this show. Not every Tv show or movie needs to have gay characters in it. Are the writers just trying to be politically correct? My review probably seems all over the place, well I guess that's because that's how I felt this show was. All. Over. The. Place. Confusing. And hey, did I mention there was too much of a heavy emphasis on Satan and Satanic rituals?!? üôÑ<br/><br/>Not a bad show. But it could have been so much better. I binge watched both seasons in one weekend. I suggest you don't do that. If you're gonna watch it, watch it more slowly. Or else you're left with your brain scrambling, and your mouth rambling on and on. Which is what I think I just did. Sorry for that. But hey! I'm actually looking forward to season 3! Maybe it won't be such a desperate attempt to fit in social and political matters, and maybe it will stick to the original storyline of Sabrina the teenage witch. ü§ûüèªüòâüòú Love where the show is going. Lots of eye opening and twists. Sabrina is a character that knows what she wants and goes for it. Love it This season is incredibly awesome! The amount of witchcraft and magic in this season is so much more than expected. The whole witchcraft thing really appeals to me, so this portrayal of Sabrina is so much better than the Melissa Joan Hart version... I highly recommend this show!üòä Really good show. The characters did a great job especially Ms wardwell In my opinion üòÇ
There some things I didn't like about the show like those high school scenes ahh and the last episode wasn't really necessary they could've just stick with 10 episodes it would be much better. This series is really lovely. The characters are portrayed very endearingly, even if they're playing gruesome parts, but the actresses and actors are giving their all.
The production value could be a little higher, imo.
But this series sucks you in and after ten episodes spits you out, leaving you wanting more. Best serie for long time üòç It was so good that I watched it 2 times in a row. Great acting.... not the same as the TV show at all... Great so far, hope it keeps the momentum.
The cinematography and direction it's so pleasing to watch. Couldn't help but notice that more than a few of the one star reviews are the first (and only) review for that account. I'd probably have given it a 7 or 8, but I put 10 just to counter the robo-reviews. Is it a perfect show? No. Is it for everyone? Not at all. I like it and I'm looking forward to a second season. The writing is fun and I find the cast to be pretty charming. Definitely a good binge. It gets better and better each part the only thing that ruins it is the musical numbers there are only like 2-3 but its not annoying enough to give this season less than a 8 definitely should watch this its great This series is just awesome! Dark, fun and has all the elements for a good series. I had to write a review after seeing some of the other negative reviews. The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina is a great show, It's dark and it's funny and it has a certain charm about it. There are feminist undertones and a politically correct cast but is that so improper in a show about witches? In this universe witches are the most powerful except for the unholy father. For the love of Satan watch this show and find out if Sabrina signs the Book of the Beast. Can't wait for season 2. And not afraid of showing power levels!
It was a gigantic rollercoaster of emotions but in my opinion the first 3 episodes portray the remainder very bad, From the forced "Cousin, Cousin" as a reminder that Ambrose is Sabrina his cousin! to the biologically confused characther Susie, And feminism/racial matters are the first thing that the series introduces too us making it seem that this is another (((Netflix Original))) but it sets itself right almost immidiately after those moments happen!<br/><br/>From "Bad-Ass" Susie physically assaulting a group of guys mocking a feminist poster only to get her face smacked down to the ground after 1 second felt incredibly gut wrenching akward but ironically funny considering it was feminism making Susie assault (equal in body and mind ) the guy in the first place<br/><br/>Directing Feminism throughout Satan was actually a very clever view of portraying it this way, It was hilarious when Aunt Zelda gave herself kudo's for feminism since it is essentially a Witch Coven!<br/><br/>Very good show if you know Biblical theology aswell, I like how false the Satanist/Witches are portrayed but from a different point of view, I like that Sabrina questions Satan and his ways alot since Sabrina sees through (((Them)))<br/><br/>I wonder sincerely what target audience this was made for, It had a mature yet kiddy like vibe i noticed Stanger Things lacked (That show was hot garbage throughout) and at certain points even had me tears rolling over my eyes (and this was before episode 8 so imagine)
It has 0% to do with the old series and i was afraid they were going too "snowflake" it up for the modern crowd but damn this show has suprised me. Well the first episode almost lost me because it was soooo boring... But in the middle of the second episode the feeling came to me, this could end up being something really good... and it sure did...
Don't listen to all the haters... If you loved the old Sabrina and think this will be the same, then stay away, because it's so far away from the old show as it can be.
BUT if you like things to be a bit twisted, dark and still believe the good guys will win in the end then give it a chance... for my part I can't wait to see what happens next... Its definitely the dark side of Sabrina the Teenage Witch. I was very skeptical at first but I loved it! Well watched all the 10 episodes and....I JUST LOVE IT!!
Kiernan Shipka as Sabrina is Worth for show. and i just love her acting as i have watched her Flowers in the Attic, 2015 movie One & Two. So can't wait for second season.
And i'm sad as netflix has ordered the series for just 2 seasons only. i expected it to go around it for 4 or 5 seasons.
Well LETS see, whats in future for this series. I don't know why you crying about season 3?? This season is the best season. The plot, new characters and costumes are f.cking amazing. I wanted more power scenes but it's ok. It was nice I red some of the other reviews and I must say I disagree. Firstly, stop comparing the original series with the reboot. This version of Sabrina's story is much darker and more suitable for our time. The creators are really focusing on the looks of the series, and I think that's an important detail. Secondly, the actors are good and you also see some character development. The narration is original, you just got to give the series a chance if you really want to enjoy it! I found both seasons of the show very entertaining, I like the balance between her being a "normal" high school girl while also being a witch. Though everything in the show is very predictable, I still very much enjoyed it. Show is visually great, scenography and costumography are well thought out and beautiful, but plot is lacking, at least in the first season, things seem to get better in season 2.
In the begging characters don't have much character in them and as I said, plot is not really compelling but after a while things star to get moving. It definitely has potential. They go a little heavy on satanic symbols and theme but you can pass over that.
Overall, if you like fantasy and have nothing else to do give it a shot, it doesn't have a lot of episodes so if you don't love it you won't lose a lot of time. So overall I like the show, i binge watch it in usually a day or two depending on time. I just wish part 2 didn't go so cliche. It became another show thinking it's ok to throw gender identity and homosexuality in our faces, because saying it's NOT ok to be that way is wrong, but it's ok to throw it in the audience's face and force people to accept it. If they didn't go along with every other show on the planet about these 'issues', then I would rate this much higher. The story line, characters, plot, it's all really fun and entertaining and besides my disagreements about some aspects I am looking forward to the 2nd season. The acting is done well and I like the costumes. As the characters evolve and darkness consumes. The concept and characters keep you wanting more as you watch each episode.<br/><br/>For the negative reviews don't pay any attention to them. They probably have not seen the show to appreciate its storyline. Possibly don't grasp the entertaining factor as well.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed Salem the show then you'll like Sabrina! As the title gives out the series will chase you down and blow your mind! Right now i m very tired from a sabrina marathon but i ll try my best to open your eyes...it is the best teenage magic series that combines everything..magic teenagers a little bit of drama some young love and a lot of old hotties.. go zelda.. The chilling adventures of Sabrina is such a beautiful juicy show. The storyline is really good.
Before the CAOS their was just the adventures of Sabrina but that show was different it is nothing compared to this show.
The chilling adventures of Sabrina is wild, wicked, amazing, lots drama, romance and adventures!! It would be really nice if there were to do a crossover with riverdale and CAOS in this upcoming season or in the future. Really good show. Don't understand the low reviews on this series, it's a very well done show that is entertaining and fun. The casting is well done, the atmosphere of the show is both fun and unsettling. Can't wait for more! I need to break down all the things about this show that made it incredibly hard to make it through season 1:
<ul><li>Sabrina is SO smug. She spends zero time studying (and 100% of her time obsessing over Harvey), doesn't listen to any other experienced witches, always finds loopholes to everything, and seemingly knows everything. She also walks into witches choir group and the instructor names her the best singer there almost immediately. She's had no weaknesses and she acts accordingly.</li><li>The whole cult/religion basically behaves as Catholics but with Satan instead of God and unholy instead of holy. They have baptisms (why?), godparents (why?), And my personal favorite... confession (why?). It's like their writers were too lazy to actually research the Temple of Satan or even come up with a fake religion. Completely shallow.</li><li>It's impossible to figure out characters' values. One second, Sabrina's Aunt hates mortals, looks down on them, and encourages Sabrina to distance herself from them. Then the next second, she's super sympathetic toward them and even opts to save them instead of be with her coven. I can't figure out what changed her mind. The girls that pick on Sabrina repeatedly help her and even become her friends group even after they make fun of her for a botched Resurrection. Again...why?</li><li>There are seemingly only 10 people in this whole town. Having a funeral? Sabrina's best friend is the singer. The random kid that Ambrose hooks up with is suddenly the high priest's confidant. And of course Sabrina's two best friends have supernatural abilities.</li><li>Everyone on the show is 16, but they're all acting like adults on a soap opera. Sabrina and Harvey are unconditionally in love and supporting each other through horrible traumatic events. Some kid pledges his love and allegiance to Sabrina the second she walks into witches school. This is NOT what being 16 is like.</li></ul><br/><br/>The only good thing about this show is Aunt Hilda. The end. Why in last 3 seson they are singing its stupid...
And why Salem is not talking... I had high hopes for this series. I was so so disappointed. Towards the end it started turning extremely juvenile and reminiscent of a Disney show catering to pre teens.
I had to skip past the parts of Sabrina crying/pleading with Nick basically not to break up with her.
Girl! You. Are. Queen. Of. Hell. Whhhyyy would you be crying over this whiney and unappreciative kid.
This is NOT the badass Morning Star from last season.<br/><br/>Also, WHAT was up with that whack music video extra? I thought I turned on Descendants by accident. The majority of bad of days I read on here were men complaining about the series being too "feminist" and saying that the #metoo movement is ruining TV. Let's be absolutely clear, they are saying this about most TV series these days. These small men can't handle a TV series about strong women. So, instead they decided to come and give bad reviews to these series because they feel inept. I honestly expected more bad reviews from extremely religious people not a bunch of whiney boys that can't handle a strong woman. I understand that some may not enjoy the series because it is very teen focused and plays heavily on fantasy. If you prefer political dramas, then this series may not be for you, and that is ok.<br/><br/>I will say, in my personal opinion that this dark coming of age tale is amazing and so much fun to watch around Halloween. The acting is wonderful and the writing takes you into a different world full of magical adventures circling around the occult, horror and witchcraft. Sabrina is a badass teen that fights the forces of evil all while managing teenage life. What is more entertaining?!<br/><br/>If anything, watch for yourself and don't pay attention to the negative reviews. The IMDb rating overall is at a 7.7 and holds an 85% rating on rotten tomatoes. I liked it initially but as the story proceeded it was kind of boring and was predictable If this show had carried on in the same spirit as the first, I would have enjoyed it but, unfortunately it hasn't and therefore has lost me as a previously avid viewer of the first series. Real shame. I personally loved this show. After watching and growing up around the origanl show its was nice to see a version from the darker side... Without light there is no dark... Its a fresh modern take on the story and one that at 32 have enjoyed. I am not gonna write the good stuff cause that would take a while
But the bad stuff for me is the show trying to show political correctness while making a show about satanic witches , nope...
The whole thing with Theo is weird, all of a sudden she/he says <<<"okay my name is Theo now, i am a boy and i wamt to go play for Boys team of basketball" , i mean, with all due respect , that is not how iz goes, and then im the locker room Boys make fun od her/him cause she is litterary a girl ! And then. 5 minutes later all is good, and her best friends already used to it and now she is Theo... Nothing wrong on the subject, but poorly written, that and many other things should have taken much more time ! I think it's a great series.
With lots of excitement in it.
And the performance is great.
I can't wait for season 3. This is extremely different than the tv show sitcom Sabrina the teenage witch. This show is extremely dark. This show is not for for anybody 17 or under. I watch it and like it but I am an adult in my early 40s. I don't know and don't care whether this is supposed to be a remake or reboot of Sabrina the teenage witch or not. Obviously it has something in common with a teenage girl named Sabrina and she is a witch being raised by her aunts. I would not let children 17 or under watch this. As a reader of the old comics (I never watched the earlier TV show, which just seemed silly), I'm enjoying it. Kiernan Shipka is great, she manages to be very sweet and tormented at the same time. I like how the mores and sensibilities are very tuned to the present day, yet the time period of show seems a bit murky - there's no mention (at least yet) of any current events or technology (they still use big phones, no cell phones, and drive old cars) - but are up to the moment modern in their reactions to situations. I actually think it's quite restrained in terms of nudity and over the top satanic carrying on - two thing I was a bit worried about in light of the bizarre whack job world of Riverdale. Great cast and storyline - enjoying this much more than I though I would! The casting is mostly perfect. The artistic decisions in the direction of photography are very interesting and likeable. The topics discussed along the story are relevant to today's world, which unfortunately a lot of other people seem disgusted about - people really dislike being a human in the world I guess. Finally, the characters are always acting realisticly and asking the right quesions. I just love this new show; The really funny thing is,...every time they mention the "Dark Lord", I simply can't stop thinking "trump". ha ha. It is a jolly spoof of how christianity and, of course, satanism takes itself Way too literally. Maybe we should make this show required viewing for the fundamentists in my family especially. We all need to lighten up a bit on the worship of books and religion in the world today you see. A higher power should have a higher purpose, and as Jesus said: follow not the pharisees but your heart and soul you're gifted with at birth. Murf The best..omg i just froze m self in-front each ep. waiting to know what will happen, best acting and best story line everything just perfect...many thanks for the hard work...waiting for season 2 really waiting ^_^. I don't believe I'm saying this but Riverdale is better, In every episode of Riverdale there is a certain excitement u r feeling but there is no such thing in this.
Sabrina is beautiful, Hilda is funny, Zelda is complicated but had a good heart.
Everyone had done a pretty good acting but u r bored sometimes as it's slow, overall it's good.
Kieran is loveüòçüòç
I only rated it 8 bcoz of kieranüòó Yes, it's a teen drama, but if I recall correctly it is Sabrina the teenage witch, fro the Archie comics-so that should not be too much of a shocker for most people who read them as a kid.<br/><br/>What I enjoy about it-in many ways it celebrated classic horror with a modern lens. From the opening title sequence to the mood, world building and atmosphere Geendale embodies. I also like they don't give what year this show suppose to be in, which adds a bit more flavor to the show. Give it a try, and hope you can find the fun and celebrate Holloween with it.... Dark show that can be great if the camera would just focus. It's not cool it just hurts my eyes. I wasnt sure about this before I started watching it, but the first 5 minutes got me hooked! It is as dark as my humor and I love witches, covens, magic, and satan. This is purely amazing and I suggest everyone give it a chance. I love the idea of having familiars like Salem (especially in goblin form). The church of night is so different and I love it. Sabrina is quirky, cute, rebellious, and smart. Kiernan Shipka is a great Sabrina and Ross Lynch is a great Harvey Kinkle. The whole cast is great and it keeps you on edge. Theres always a twist and never gets boring! Fantastic storytelling: writing, acting, production - all of it. A great spooky show for the autumn season! Its a very good show and i look forward to the next season, but real witches do not worship satan they worship the cycle of life. in Wicca there are multiple gods and goddesses who help with different situations in life... herbolagy is important and being light not dark, and if a witch does bad to others it comes back to them. witches worship the seasons and use those seasons for replenishment and rebirth. there is a whole other side to witches that should be shown in the next season. as they show them here as something to be feared here. but that is hollywood. At first it seemed dull and faminist kinda , but as show progress it's awasome and be the time you finish episode 10, you will be smiling at heavens, this is really good. Watched with burning curiosity, incapable to stop!
I remember a tv show from 90s about a young witch, her aunts and a cat. It was not interesting for me that time, the show was quite girlish.
This one has nothing in common with the spirit of old series.
Dark atmosphere. From the first moments you have the feeling of something bad, evil but tempting upcoming. The only guess is how far there will be the line of blood, murders and so on.. Fortunately it is not that far as you might expect after all these game of thrones.
First season is well balanced with drama, mysteries and answers. The plot is solid, and I could not spot any serious holes in logics. I also loved the cast and acting. You will be beyond bewildered by this series!! If you're a crazed 90's Sabrina & Buffy fan like me, you will love this show!<br/><br/>I live in Europe and am not quite in tune with any release dates in the States- but I was somewhat intrigued to get a notification on my phone for the newest releases on Netflix. As soon as I saw 'The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina', I immediately thought back to the campy TV series 'Sabrina, The Teenage Witch' I know from the 90s...<br/><br/>I watched the trailer and was a bit turned off. I'd originally thought it was a movie - but my curiosity led me to delve a bit deeper and discover that this series is based off of a comic that was based on the "original" original...if that makes sense...only with a very realistic and rather sadistic background.<br/><br/>I'll just cut the crap and say HOT DAMN!!! I am very impressed by the storyline, the cinematography AND the script of the show!! I grew up watching Buffy and the like, so I'm not at all offended by any sort of violence and drudgery that occurs. Might I add, I'm only on the 4th episode. And I'm already hooked. If you have certain expectations of what Sabrina is "supposed" to be like, you'll be disappointed. This storyline follows a different tune. And it's well worth watching.<br/><br/>I've been feening....literally *feening* for a show like this lately, and it has certainly delivered so far. I'm looking forward to completely finishing the series *tonight* , just to see what happens. I'm also hoping that this won't be one of those series that leaves you hanging, then makes you wait until certain critics give it the green light to continue with another season... but it's almost always that way with good shows.<br/><br/>Happy watching!!! Obviously, I loved the hell out of this show. As a huge Riverdale fan and a fan of the RAS comic, I went in expecting to love it, but it was so much better than I could've hoped. Tonally, it was perfection. Nobody commits to tone like Roberto. And I think tone is one main reason certain people don't "get" Riverdale. It's meant to be over the top, campy, soapy with a pulpy noir tone. That's why I love it, among MANY other reasons. And that's why I love CAOS. The tone is absolutely perfect and the writers commit to it and never veer away. LOVE IT!!! Great acting, delicious storylines. I could go on and on. (Everyone needs an Aunt Hilda!) And Ambrose is my newest spirit animal...(Jughead is still my main spirit animal)<br/><br/>
As for the PC stuff, I honestly don't like a ton of political or social issues bombarding me in my tv shows. I know what my opinions are and I don't need a tv show to tell me what to think, but in this show (and Riverdale) it just doesn't bother me. As long as the story and acting is really good, I'm good.<br/><br/>I also enjoyed that it was a satirical look, in my opinion, at organized religion. Chuckled at that a lot.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you enjoy the tone and feel of Riverdale and like your tv deliciously dark and juicy, you'll most likely love this. Need more seasons!!! Story and darkness at its best!!! Why oh why did they turn this into a musical??? Season three is ruined It took only one episode to put me in binge mode, It is a little bit darker than what I've hoped for but it turned out to be so fun. I hope it doesn't lose it's magic in the coming seasons. How can this series have a 7.8 rating, when no one has scored it higher than 6?<br/><br/>It took too long for me to really start enjoying this, but once I did, I did. Once engaged, I felt like I was watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer again for the first time. And that's in no way a criticism.<br/><br/>Kiernen Shipka started as discount Hermione, but grew on me, because I started to think she really is that earnest and she's equally good in The Silence, whoever played Lord Blackwood is a committed scenery chewer and what can I say about Michelle Gomez and Dawn from The Office, that doesn't sound like i'm trying to get their numbers? I am BTW, üòÇ<br/><br/>They're slightly more subtle in the monster of the week, foregoing it for challenge or obstacle of the week. Some of the lore, admittedly respun, is just credible enough with its use of authentic sounding names and phases - Phsycopomps, Lilleth etc. had me reaching for Google to check veracity/interpretation.<br/><br/>It borrows copiously from Hogwarts, Stephen King and many others, but I think it does it with love, so not offended, why would I be? Stranger Things repackaged both Stevens/Stephens - King and Spielberg and I bought the collectors edition of that, metaphorically.<br/><br/>If you have a bit of time - pursue..! Season 1 doesn't really get going until halfway through. Season 2 is far more immediately enjoyable. CAOS is just like a vivid dream, perhaps the one Mrs. Wardwell saw, all the while lying "dead". And like every dream, it is flawed to the core.<br/><br/>Though the promising Part One seemed to be flawlessly executed but somewhere down the line in Part Two things starts dwindling a bit. I was utterly confused about the overall themes and tones of the show. Some episodes were outright dark and Savage, but there were also equally "dumb" and redundant episodes in the mix. The differences in the tone were sometimes annoying.<br/><br/>I had no problem with the characters in Part One, but again coming to Part Two, characters were a bit incoherent. Harvey is now just a one dimensional "mortal" fool, instead of the charming and brave boyfriend in Part One. Likewise, Sabrina's friends were confused whether to shower with acceptance or held her in contempt. They kept on switching their frivolous minds, sometimes illogically.<br/><br/>But having said all of this, this show is definitely worth my time. This is funny (even charming in Part One) and entertaining. A must watch even with its flaws. I'm a man & this show is pure genius! IMBD has been taken over by troll who create account after account becuz they have nothing better to do!!! This show is so dark & beautiful & smart & weird! There is a reason it's ratings are so high & that all the men & woman I know love this show! All the losers on here can make as many bad reviews as they want but they won't effect the success of the show! The first season is soooooo good but now S2 after all the world building is out of the way! They get to just have a total blast & it shows! But this is no riverdale I mean they eat humans it's much darker! This is in my top 3 favorite shows of all time & that's saying something becuz I watch EVERYTHING & I consider my taste level to be pretty high! But I'm not a hater either! I can't imagine how hard it is to create something like this! & something this visually beautiful should never get a 1! These are the same men complaining about a woman Jeti and woman ghostbusters & woman doctor who! And a woman super hero! Shut up you realize u wouldn't have been born without a woman! I'm not saying this show is for everyone but give it 4 episodes that's my motto if u don't like it after that don't waste ur time! But appreciate all the work and detail put into the sets and the writing & the cloths! Just everything! This show is a campy masterpiece & it grabbed me in the first 10 minutes! I wasn't expecting Emmy winning drama and I think it's fun and I love the way they all dress, so kudos to the costume department!!
It's very timeless yet vintage at the same time.
I think the acting is decent and over the top when it's called for..the aunts keep me laughing for sure!
This isn't a serious show so people should not take it so seriously. Watch with an open mind and enjoy the shenanigans... Lovely show with magic, suspense, laughter, intrigue, twists and much more! A binge-worthy show! I was super excited when I first seen the trailer for this soon to be released new adaption of the comic.
Much like the original; It's dark and brooding, suspenseful and best of all - witchy! I don't understand the hate it has recieved but don't let that deter you from giving it a watch and deciding yourself! This show incorporated not only elements of light-horror (not so much as to frighten everyone away) but also portrays a great deal of authentic humor and really really 'badass' moments, that is missing from mainstream shows today. I can understand the political discussions may upset some people, but for me, it really does contribute to her character, story line and the events that would unfold.
This is all I can say without any spoilers :) This is a great series to watch, probobly more for girls but i loves itüòç hope there is coming more of Sabrinaüòç Literally cannot believe how bad this show is. Why the high ratings? Definitely one of those times where the ratings have been fraudulently bumped up by someone in a position of power. Anyone who's actually watched the show knows how genuinely bad, and universally hated this show actually is. A massive joke. Save yourself some time and heartache and don't even bother. Just finished watching the first season, and I have to say, I enjoyed my time watching it! The story is great, the characters are engaging, and it lives up to it's full potential! Though I don't really care for the satanic aspect of it, Chilling Adventures of Sabrina is still fun to watch! So I absolutely love this show, as someone who practices Wicca/witchcraft this show has plenty of fun hints towards it and alludes many things related or used in it - not only are they cute and make me smile but they also are accurate! Not everyone may understand or even get all of the hints because they are made to only be recognized by a certain group of people (those that practice witchcraft or Wicca) sooo, the show may not be for everyone - but it's fantastic.<br/><br/><ul><li>1 star because of one or two of the actors/actresses (it takes you out of the show)</li></ul> After the second episode I knew it was a great show because I didn't want to waste it by binge watching it but I just had to continue watching. I spread it over 3 days. Can't wait for season 2. I had great expectations for this series by watching the trailer and mind blowing posters and yeah, I watch Riverdale. It didn't quite meet my expectations but it was good. All the cast did a great job with Kiernan Shipka and Miranda Otto leading them. They were excellent in their roles. The beginning episodes were very good and then when we reach midway, it started to pull back a little bit. We may get a little bored in the mid episodes. But the ending episodes were also very good. Especially the last one. They setted up a very good mood for the next season. We may find some similarities for this story with that of Harry Potter's. Like the dark magic, special schools, orphaned protagonist, good friends, bad friends etc etc. So the story is interesting and give it a try. If this was better than most series, which it was, surely the highly critical reviews are bent out of shape for personal biases. But you likely guessed much.<br/><br/>
Season 2 gives the misogynists even more triggers, which is wonderful. You have to hit a caveman over the head quite hard to get a point though, or knock them out to shut them up.<br/><br/>So far, episode 4 of season 2 is my favorite. What a waste of time! Every episode gets worse. You can't compare this to the Sabrina of our childhood. A shallow tv-show. A disgrace... A wicked little gem of a (limited?) series with superior performances by Miranda Otto, Lucy Davis, and Richard Coyle. Plus a bonus Winter Solstice episode that explains where Christmas really comes from.<br/><br/>Smart, edgy, and cool from start to finish. For Those who are complaining on here grow up! This is American Horror Story for teens/young adults. If you watch Anime, this is close to FullMetal Alchemist. Just have an open mind and enjoy I love the darker take on this show. I loved Sabrina the Teenage Witch growing up but in my opinion while these two are completely different they are still amazing all on their own. This show may not be for everyone, but it is refreshing to see a different take and a much darker version. Okay this show is really good, the imagery is really awesome, & the storyline is cool too. but the one problem i have w it is the acting, oh my god. ross lynch is probably the worst actor i have ever seen & he just completely ruins every scene he's in. I love that it is darker than the 90's sitcom. Netflix is amazing and the second season is only a month away and I can't wait. Also to the haters it's based off comics and Netflix named it chilling adventures of Sabrina for a reason. I don't know why everyone loves this series, simply saying it's "darker than the original". This is inappropriate. Sabrina is a child friendly franchise for all ages. This is all about worshipping the devil. Since when does a fun, light hearted teenage comedy and drama series turn into a teenage girl worshipping the devil, with rituals, swearing and gore? This is just an excuse to glorify the devil. It is also aimed at 14 year olds. WHAT?! This should be 18! Other countries like Norway and Russia have better age ratings for this series. Not only is this satanic Illuminati, but Hilda and Zelda are played by an Australian and a Scot. Why?? They're from the USA. Get Americans or Canadians to play them.<br/><br/>I would reccomend that if you want to watch Sabrina, watch any of the proper child friendly versions from the past. Awesome show, kept me at the edge of my seat, I cannot wait for season 2. It is bewildering how white men seem to be so bothered with a new series that has social awarenes in its plot, calling it "political", whereas this has nothing to do with politics at all! Women's rights to be safe and not assualted, discriminated against, people of colour or godamn witches (see what they did here) is not about politics, people.
That puts aside, as a 90s kid it is a bit difficult to forget the original cult show Sabrina, but this is refreshing, chilly and has nice filmography. Looking forward to see more of it. This show is fantastic. Not sure what's up with negative reviews but it's brilliant! Must watch! amazing show The best part about this show is that it upsets born-again Christians and Dumptards! Amusing, humorous, a little suspense, and well researched, (mythologically). A little bit shocked that some people rated this show anything less then 9 stars. Everything about it is amazing, the setting, actors and plot. Well worth the watch!! I an From Thailand .I followed a lot from NetFlix. I like it very much. I am very well pleased with this show, and this coming from someone that was a huge fan of the original sit com! I think they did an amazing job on this show! The actors are amazing, everyone was very well cast, and the story line is very well written. Cant wait for season 2! I never write reviews, but as I was reading through the reviews I saw someone complaining about fake reviews by IMDB. It actually encouraged me to sign up in give you my honest opinion.
I was initially not sure what I thought as I was watching what I thought would be a traditional reboot of "Sabrina the Teenage Witch." It was not was I was expecting and I was disappointed initially (I loved the original show!) but as I continued to watch, it really won me over.
It's definitely not for everyone, but it really reminded me of a strange mix of Buffy the vampire slayer, meets Beetlejuice, meets Harry Potter. Definitely worth a watch! Season 1
RATING: 8.545. HEADLINE: I LOVE MICHELLE GOMEZ AND KIERNAN SHIPKA (Review date: June 3, 2019)<br/><br/>The really good story aside, Michelle Gomez's Ms. Wardwell and Kiernan Shipka's Sabrina Spellman make the first season of "Chilling Adventures of Sabrina" outstanding!<br/><br/>Season 2
RATING: 8.556 HEADLINE: BAD 5, GREAT 4. (Review date: June 3, 2019)<br/><br/>Season 2's first five episodes were a chore to watch, with Ms. Wardwell and Theo's stories being the only highlights, but "Chilling Adventures of Sabrina" were saved by the amazing, near-perfect last 4 episodes. This show is filled with intense drama that is only hard to understand if you don't accept their focus around dark arts. Everything in this show is about the dark side such as hell and dark magic. It's only dull if you don't pay 110% attention to it. Everything in the show said is important, so don't loose focus and you won't be confused or even for a second think it's not "balanced out". I think this is a GREAT thriller, IF you are open to opportunity. All I can say is it knocks riverdale out of the park! Of course there are discrepancies between real witches, and film witches. (Real witches send no harm...) But the story line is imaginative and has a lot of potential for future seasons. I didn't want to see Sabrina becoming a full witch yet. But who knows, maybe part of her power will be taken away and will make it more challenging for her to fight her enemies. I would love to see a crossover. Can't wait to see more. This show is for tik tok users and kpop fans. This review was too short so I'm adding more useless line to fill out the word quota. As a 69 yo. male I have to admit to the 2 guilty pleasures I have One is Riverdale and Adventures of Sabrina. What drew me to these series are the way they are shot. The mood and lighting are very addicting to me. Scripts are very good for the Universe they are written for, I love Kiernan Shipka from her time on Mad Men she is a great young actress she is made for this role. Innocent yet a bit devious. All the Characters combine for wonderful story lines. Aunt Zelda the Leader of the Spellman Family Lucy Davis as the Comic Relief Aunt Hilda, great looking young actors just like Riverdale it's a great formula. Is it goofy yes is it a bit disturbing with Satan worship for sure. I an not comfortable with that like I said Guilty Pleasure. I love Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa shooting style colors like Pop's Chocolate Shop on Riverdale. So maybe just great eye candy with some fun story. They must work these young actors into the ground. Looks like hard work making these series. Thank you. As someone born in the 90's it is good to see Sabrina revisited after the 1996 series. It is completely different in all aspects, but fits in well with the current Riverdale series and is also more inline with the comics. Overall it is a great watch. I viewed all episodes in a day. Great cast, storylines best appreciated when you suspend disbelief. S3 was an enjoyable series. There is definitely much more scope for upcoming series. I hope it gets renewed. Season 1&2 were so beautiful. Season 3 was not as much as good as the previous seasons but it was okay. I hope we see more Caliban and Nicholas in season 4. The story is good. The effects are fun. Zelda, Hilda, and Lillith are fabulous. But the teen drama, coupled with Sabrina's flat character and unapologetic savior complex, sucks the life out of the third season in particular. Very dark themes here and it gets very real. I liked it alot. Wasn't expecting anything at all when i started watching but was surprised about how they handled the characters and their dynamics. There is some good acting. Father Blackwood is gooood! I really wanted to like it, but it dwells too much on the devil. I understand that it is supposed to be dark, but it is too dark for me. It sucks because I really like the cast. This is a great show and a much needed adaptation of Sabrina. I liked it , it's a bit like early buffy the vampire slayer . Not too serious a bit of spooky fun not for everyone and if you don't like this sort of thing don't watch it . At last a show that deserves to be mentioned alongside BtVS Please ignore all those haters. This show checks all the boxes for me. I could not get enough. The characters are likeable, yet each have their flaws. The clothing choices and music is superb. The plot is zany, yet works. I love how you don't know what you're going to get with each episode. And definitely ignore the feminist/fascist comments because they obviously haven't watched much of either season. It's a fight of good against evil, but the lines may blur, so it keeps you on your toes. Love it. Love it. Love it! Keep it up. From what I've seen on here a lot of people didn't enjoy the first season fro reasons mainly to do politics and for comparing it to the old sitcom; which I find silly when the shows are completely considering this one is a horror show which makes more sense since from what I know the comics where also of the horror genre. The first season I still enjoyed it didn't blow me away but it was still enjoyable but the second season was AMAZING. It starts off at fairly nice pace but the last 5 episodes is were it really picks up and it picks up good, these 5 episodes alone are worth the wait and are 10x better then the episodes previously seen. When I watched it all 5 of them felt like a season finale that I kept loosing track of what episode it was and.how many I had left, it just kept coming back for more. Don't let these negative reviews from other users put you off all of them are before the second season premiered, I promise you the second season is worth it and I'm most looking forward to the next one 2nd season is worst.1st season is not bad but 2nd is worst. i dont recommend to watch it The best episode of part I its episode 10 when she takes the dark batism to save the town of Greendale. From part 2, Episode 6-7 were the best. ( Sabrina's familly get atacked by witch-hunters and they atack also the academy of unseen arts, and when Sabrina died i though, that's the end' but her resurection was amazing! Really enjoyed the first season, great storyline and characters. Especially Michelle Gomez.<br/><br/>Season 2 was all over the place. Storylines worth an entire series introduced and thrown away in one episode. Plot lines from previous series seem to have been forgotten about and a suspect character just written out. Seriously, one of my favorite serious ive ever watched. Can't wait for season 3. This show could've been great, I like how the main character is a witch that is supposed to serve the Dark Lord aka Satan. And they could've made an amazing story out of this, but instead they are trying to shove PC crap down our throat almost every episode. It starts out with some feministic club against the patriarchy. At this point I was like: "Is this really nessecary? Does this add any value to the story?", but I just decided to not care too much about it, but than a couple episodes later another one of these 'issues' arrives when one of the main characters friends decides she wants to read a classic book but the school prohobits this book. So now they want to change that. I haven't watched past this point yet, but I can only assume this is what the show is going to keep trying to push forward as it despirately tries to be 'woke'. After reading a couple of the negative reviews here and not being particularly convinced, I decided to try out Sabrina! So glad I did, the show is amazingly well produced. The music, especially in the first season, is top quality, the acting is great and the show creates a really good mix between magic and normal life. The magic itself is very interesting, and if you love lots of Satanic and horror movie references you won't be disappointed. Also a shout-out to the wardrobe which was very well done, especially for Ambrose and the other witches.<br/><br/>Sabrina herself is a really talented and well rounded lead and the supporting cast are all amazing. I can't name anyone whose part I thought was weak. The character development for Sabrina and the others was definitely welcomed, and I appreciated how dark the show actually was.<br/><br/>Give it a try, you won't be disappointed. My daughter and I have watched it from the beginning and now just finished Season 2. We are in love with this show, of course their are some script issues, but not every show or movie is perfect. Just enjoy it for what it is and stop looking for any script issues. We can't wait for season 3. I'm just about to start the second season. I really enjoyed the first one. It's silly yet dark humor and it has a great story. I think the devil worship is what pushes bible thumper fans away as well as people who are dying to pick at anything they can find to complain about. Especially the review about the terms hanged and hung. Lol Lame wannabe critics will bash anything and everything unless it's something they specifically enjoyed as a personal preference. Just another reason why these reviews are not needed and are getting old I really applaud the attempts to push through males stereotypes and privilege. The qualm I have of this is Sabrina is narcissistic and a bully. Yes woman need to speak loud, keep the door open with their foot, yell sometimes, but Sabrina just comes across as a spoilt brat. Think its more of how she acts her part, than her actual part. The show it not Amazing but it also not bad..... The acting is Good, the story interesting(it has some SJW things in it that are a bit annoying) but it a nice show to watch.... The horror it "soft" but enjoyable..... The special effects are fine ( B+).... I like the overall atmosphere created by the weird furniture, architecture and music...... When I seen the trailer for Sabrina, I thought, here we go again, theyre going to ruin another comic I grew up with ESPECIALLY after watching season 1 of Riverdale I was like meh... season 2 I could hardly make myself watch as I played games on my phone. I kept thinking as I seen Sabrina advertised that it was going to be too dark and stupid. One night near Halloween I was feeling the spirit and I am SO glad that I did! What a great story! I loved every minute that each episode wove through each character! I highly recommend. Now where is Part 2?! I'm not one to write reviews and this is my first time but I want people to know this show is great. The dialogue was great, the story and the acting! Kiernan is the perfect Sabrina we could imagine. I can't wait for season 2. This is my favorite version of Sabrina. My husband and I love it!!! Watched the whole serie and i must say i loved it very much, it has a lot of PC in it but still a very good scary show Reminds me of Buffy/Angel but better. Each episode makes you want to discover more of Sabrina's path... Saw first 3 episodes and i was hooked instantly, this is not a kids show, its dark and i love it. Characters are really good and likeable and a good story every episode.<br/><br/>I saw some remarks about feminism and politics but the lead persons are women and it would be strange if there was no strong women with woman ideas in it.
Try to just watch and enjoy it and don't get triggered by whatever strange political or women ideas you have in your country. Love this and can't wait to watch more! The show doesn't try to replace sabrina the teenage witch and has a completely different view. I have loved this two seasons. Many will disagree with me, but i think they have gone really far taking into account it comes from a simple horror comic.
The ambientation is incredible, the acting is consistent. The music is great.
I think the thing that upsets a lot of people, is that they want something funny, full of action or really scary, but i love how do they manage to balance all without becoming a full terror show. Because it is not. It really is about values, and learning how to navigate those blurry grey lines we live daily.
The way they present all this good/bad, vengance/forgiveness is awesome but is not for everybody.
In aspects to get better, they could develope more some characters One of my fave shows ever! Great story, Sabrina and Harvey are wonderful! I want season 2 and 3 already! It took me 2 weeks to watch 10 episodes of Ozark, but only 3 days to watch 10 episodes of Sabrina season 1.
I love Ozark, but this is easy on the eye, fun and enjoyable.
You don't have to think about every plot turn and twist, and, unlike other reboots, it isn't a political statement (in season 1)
Highly entertaining and brilliant.
Amended after watching the 2nd season,
Has become very SJW, and after giving a 10 after the 1st season, it has gone extremely downhill.
Catering for the minority not the majority.
How very Hollywood!! So I'm a 60 year old male and this isn't the genre you would expect me to watch. I started watching the pilot as a time filler, not expecting to even see the entire episode. Loved it.<br/><br/>The character of Sabrina is played in a very attractive way. She is full of questions without being naive. She isn't afraid to do the right thing or make the hard choice, even if there isn't credit for her to do so. She wins people over by assuming the best of them. In short, she is who we would like to be, and manages to do it without being sappy. The setting isn't real, but the character of Sabrina is refreshing, so I enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Wade into episode #1. If you like the atmosphere, you will find the entire season to be equally fun. Overly dramatic in all the best ways.
Perfect for Halloween.
Wonderful actors and characters. The lobby of lgbt is ruining everything this days, it could be a good show but they must be political correctness The lead actress, and all the others also in fact, are great. Not for fundamentalists, but a great ride for those appreciating humor, yes even the dissing of rude boys, good writing and adept filmography. Has nothing in common with the sitcom... It's an outstanding great show I really enjoyed watching it hopefully there will be more seasons then just 2 First I am not a teenager, I love the style of filming the series, I love the blurry camera shots and the actors are perfect for this kind of series.<br/><br/>Solid cast engaging plot and compelling visuals.<br/><br/>for those who are reading reviews deciding whether to watch this series, it should be noted that the majority of negative reviews are based on the overly political nature of the first two episodes in the show. That is stupid!<br/><br/>Those reviewers who have come to suggest this is a propaganda machine would care to watch the third episode and beyond before making their criticism.<br/><br/>However, this show definitely worth watching if you enjoy the concept of witches . This new take on the classic series is not for children that's for sure, it's dark, its dramatic and its suspenseful, and after watching the first episode, im hooked and I wanna see what happens next to Sabrina! With that being said one thing annoys me about the show... The camera effects, half the first episode they add the haze effect to the outside of the screen, like a dream sequence or old memory, the problem is they do this most of the time and its irritating. Other than their decision to use this camera effect way to much, this new take on Sabrina is well worth the watch! I binged all 10 episodes in one sitting! This show has something for everyone and it's a perfect blend of everything! You won't be disappointed. 11/10 would recommend! I've gained a big appreciation for Archie comics and I'm definitely gonna give Riverdale a try after I finish this show. The actress does a marvelous job playing Sabrina Spellman. She's also super gorgeous and as I am still in high school, I definitely found my celebrity crush. Right from the start Chilling Adventures of Sabrina sucks you in. Kiernan is awesome as Sabrina and the supporting cast is fantastic. The writing is sharp and fresh and the sfx are solid. I am excited to watch this unfold part by part. If part one is any indication this show will do real well. This show is supposed to be for teens?! It is nothing but a crash course in the dark side of Satanic religion. Dialogue such as "Do as thy will", "Hail, Satan" and "Your Dishonors" isn't some lightweight look at a witch's life. This is brainwashing and programming. Satanic worshipers flip all of the light side and do/say the opposite. Baphomet himself comes to life and even a massive statue at the school she is sent to are part of this audience indoctrination. Don't let your children watch this. I couldn't believe how unfiltered this show is. What is next - the sacrificing? For a long time I was denying in seeing this show.... but I gave it a try and it's AMAZING!!!!!! Made me laugh for all of the first 5 episodes I've watched... Wait, it's NOT a comedy? I started watching this and fell in love with the series! I love the new spin on Sabrina the Witch series! The attention to detail is perfect!! The love, hate and consequences of all the actions of the caracters. I rewatched it already qnd still LOVE it!! Never been a fan of this type of shows but I must stay that even if the first season can have a slow pace at times, it's perfectly normal... Sabrina is learning and understanding what it means to be both a witch and a mortal.<br/><br/>As she evolves the show also becomes better. At the end of the first season and on the second she is a much mature character and the show is much better. Her relationship with the members of the underworld and the mortals is so fun to watch. Her family is also incredible! Frustrating at times but really lovely at others.<br/><br/>This show is full of emotions and twists!<br/><br/>Enjoyed all of it but the show starts slowly and it ends on a big crescendo!!
Very thrilled for the next season. Kiernan is becoming a fine actress. Lots of potencial for both the show and her I would say the rating of 7.7 is about right. I enjoy magic and there's plenty of it. The female star is a strong actress. I like that she is an independent thinker and stands up for friends. The aunts and magical "adults" are excellent. The mortal boy is really boring so far. The gender themes are forced. But it's a fun show. Not addictive but entertaining. This is a superb re-imagining of the classic character, based on a recent comic book by the same name, which itself was partially inspired by a short-lived series by a similar comic title in the 1970's. This series embraces the horror aspects, which were traditionally ignored by the Archie comics. The stories here are fun, with lots of great visuals and tons of Easter eggs for anyone who is interested in the occult. WOW.Many of these reviews are back from when season 1 had dropped on Netflix.I do admit,season 1 was a drag especially on the storylines but at least it was decent.Ill give season 1 a 6/10.But DAMN,when I was halfway through season 2 I couldn't believe what I was watching.Season 2 is a clear 10/10 for me.Here are the reasons why:<br/><br/>1.The blurry side cinematography was taken down a notch.(Trust me y'all weren't the only ones getting headaches from that)
2.The plot took an amazing and enticing turn especially from chapter 17
3.The script work heavily developed from season 1
4.The characters started to be likable(Acting kinda more like teenagers,unlike their neighbors(riverdale).
5.There we're many burning questions from season 1 which had the most brilliant answers any TV show plot could ask for.
6.The acting was improved on a higher level.
7.The finale was amazing and delivered an excellent but not too strong cliffhanger.<br/><br/>Season 2 raised this show's standards a thousand times over and I can't wait for Part 3.
If you are able to handle slow character development and a not so strong plot you can go ahead and start season 1.But if you've gotten bored over the first season,my advice is,DO NOT GIVE UP JUST YET.It gets a thousand times better.
Average rating:8.8/10 That's the real question to the people reviewing this show a 1 or 2. Spoiler alert, it's not the comic, it's adapted from said media. If you want excessive gore, nudity and guts go read the comic, if you want something that's accessible, easy to watch and engaging watch this show. If you cannot get over the fact it doesn't have Sabrina and company nude or it not being strict 100% to the source material, don't watch the show and spare us all the nitpicking and whining. I started watching this show with skepticism and took a break after episode 1 because I wasn't drawn in right away. I gave it another go and really enjoyed it. It's a bit over the top in terms of gore and occult imagery (think stereotypes), which I enjoy, and I like it more than the Riverdale-counterpart. I agree with other reviewers that it could tone down some of the aggressive storylines about challenging misogyny and homophobia - I am NOT against challenging those things within a show, they just don't do it super gracefully, it's a little on the nose, so much so that I wonder if they have any core staff who are LGBTQA+. It felt a bit like exploitation to draw in a wider audience. That being said, there's quite a bit diversity in the cast. I really enjoy the actress who plays Sabrina.<br/><br/>Get passed the first episode in both seasons, and you'll be alright! I liked it ..but some episodes are a little bit boring in season 1 ..BUT season 2 was SOO GOOD My spoiler free review for The Bloody Asylum that can be found at WordPress, Mr Geeky blog:<br/><br/>Like many outside of the U.S. I was only ever aware of Sabrina The Teenage Witch through the TV series that ran from 1996 to 2003. I had no idea she actually started life in Archie's Comics as what was initially planned as a one shot strip that was created by George Gladir and Dan DeCarlo. Her first appearance was in Archie's Madhouse issue #22 in October 1962, She then went on to appear in all 106 issues of Archie's TV Laugh Out from 1969 to 1986 and then her own comic book series from 1971 to 1983. Whereas the original TV series was based on the earlier comic books the Netflix series is based on the 2014 and 2015 comic books written by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, who also developed the series and is an executive producer. The title of this revamped Sabrina says it all really, Chilling Adventures of Sabrina.<br/><br/>The series sits firmly within the horror genre. A coming of age story that is far more darker than the sitcom nature of Sabrina the Teenage Witch. The two series really could not be more different. A slow burn character driven horror series, in part inspired by films such as The Exorcist and Rosemary's Baby. Referencing them and others, for instance Suspiria, A Nightmare on Elm Street, The Fog, the Dr Phibes films, Macbeth, and The Crucible. There were also 150 Clive Barker paintings used in the series. So as you can see just from those references and the inclusion of the paintings there really is very strong horror elements within the series.<br/><br/>However, these horror elements are perfectly juxtaposed with the humor, and at times very dark humor. The horror aspects and themes the series deals with are at times far more adult than expected from what could be perceived as "just a teen show." Sabrina is a teenager so there are the expected teen elements, at times bringing to mind Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Happily it never feels as if it is trying to emulate Joss Whedon's series. Surprisingly the story arcs are never stretched out needlessly like some series fall into the trap of. Each episode is for the most part almost stand alone with many wrapping up some story elements by the episodes end. However, there is a continuing story arc throughout the entire season. Although a slightly weak point of the season was the Christmas special episode. While it was as good as the rest of the season and worked really well on its own merits it was slightly disappointing that it did not follow through with some aspects of the season finale. Hopefully this will be addressed with Season 2.<br/><br/>Kiernan Shipka as Sabrina was a superb choice, bringing just what is needed to every facet of the character. She is brilliantly supported by Miranda Otto and Lucy Davis as Sabrina's aunts Zelda and Hilda, wonderfully playing off of one another, a perfect double act. Superbly depicting, with at times beautiful nuances, their relationship with each other, Sabrina, and Sabrina's cousin Ambrose. Lucy Davis' sublime ability of being able to go from serious to humor and vice versa in the same shot, or even sentence of dialogue, is perfectly utilized, with Miranda Otto superbly depicting a soft heart beneath the hard exterior. Michelle Gomez, who was used far better than she ever was in Doctor Who as Missy, and Richard Coyle are the standouts among the supporting cast.
Chance Perdomo as Ambrose, Jaz Sinclair and Lachlan Watson as Sabrina's best friends, Ross Lynch as her boyfriend, and Tati Gabrielle as the leader of a trio of witches perfectly round out the main cast. Every actor is absolutely faultless, with all of them delivering pitch perfect performances, making it feel as if they have played the characters far longer than just the one season.<br/><br/>Each of the aspects from the writing to the direction, to the beautiful Gothic influenced production design and superb cinematography add up to making Chilling Adventures of Sabrina feel modern yet also with a feel of the 1950s and 1960s. The series is creepy, scary, at times disturbing, contrasted with some fun aspects.<br/><br/>For those that have not been tempted to watch Chilling Adventures of Sabrina there is honestly without a doubt a lot to satisfy horror fans and those who are looking for an intelligent and thoughtful depiction of teenagers going into adulthood.<br/><br/>Season Two is without a doubt one of my most anticipated seasons of any series in 2019 A reboot I've been here for since the beginning, now I'm enchanted and here for the ride, keep the seasons coming!!! I've just finished watching the second season (after binge watching the whole thing in three days) I loved every aspect of this show from the actors who did phenomenally (always been a fan of Michelle Gomez) to the set designs and music.<br/><br/>I will admit some of the themes on the show feel a bit teachy (I.e the trans storyline and overarching feminism) but they are dealt with brilliantly and are not boring or dragged out and never overtly forced on the viewers.<br/><br/>This show left me wanting to sign my name in the book of the beast and join the church of night just to be in this universe that has been superbly crafted by the shows creators. Its dark, its fun, its cute and the perfect rendition of Sabrina the teenage witch. The first season was a little difficult to get into, I admit. Towards the end of season 1, I started getting really hooked. Season 2 was so intriguing. Loved the darkness, her hair, her attitude and her love life! Love the girl power vibe, as well I didn't think I'd like this iteration, but ended up loving it!! I like it! It has some weaknesses but, its amusing. Good path but they should more careful about details. Dramas are just WEAK! It just too easy for a school girl to manage them. If you wanna see this series just watch it for amusment and expect nothing more! In my opinion its more interesting for teenagers. I really enjoyed this show. The plot line was interesting and engaging and kept me captivated through the show. However much like Riverdale, the cliche people that it portrays make it hard to watch a bit. But I really liked the character arc of Susie's character. Anyway, overall a good show, but with its cringy elements, it isn't great When I first watched the trailer, I was intrigued by the beautiful cinematics and special effects. I thought I would be meeting with the teenage girl next door, sweet, charming, and bubbly, who is also a witch.<br/><br/>Instead, I was met with a half-mortal and half-witch teenager named Sabrina Spellman (born from a mortal mother, Diana and a High Priest father, Edward) who overestimated her freedom as a being in the world. Like all teenagers, she thought that she can and will have her own way of living her life. The good thing about her is that she has her own freewill and refused to be dragged down by ill faith which her coven/cult has been following and believed for centuries. Also, she has best of both worlds.<br/><br/>Little did she know that her fate has been drawn by the Dark Lord himself. Everything that she has to do or endured has been the masterplan and manipulation of the Devil himself in order for her to give her soul to him on her own freewill. That says a lot about how we, humans has been living in our own world, doesn't it? For all Sabrina knew was that she did the right thing. What about us? Did we all write our own fate or destiny or was it a masterplan and manipulation of a greater power?<br/><br/>This, I find beautiful with the show. It provoked me to think whether we have been living by faith and believe that fate/destiny will take us there like the witches in the coven, or that we have been living by freewill all this time writing our own fate and destiny like Sabrina did; not knowing whether there is a greater power (be it true or false, we believe it or not) that has been working everything out for us.<br/><br/>Yes, the show did touched on women's rights/politics. When Susie was attacked by the jocks; When a High Priest from another coven suddenly had a revelation that allowed him to defile the Queen of Feast before the Feast of Feasts; Also when man has more power in the coven and woman are supposed to obey and not question.<br/><br/>It's merely a reminder that equality is significant for living in harmony. All genders should live equally and not only one sex should have greater power but all should have equal great power.<br/><br/>It wasn't all political throughout the end of the season. We also see that Sabrina challenged the balance of the world when she prohibitedly resurrect Tommy from the dead; A strong reminder that we shouldn't tempered with things that has been forbidden for us to tempered with. But like how Sabrina was stubborn enough, we did anyways and now like Sabrina did, we have to suffer the consequences. It may not be as dramatic as bringing the dead to life but we did lie, we did steal and we did crimes that made us suffer from guilt. How are so different and unlike Sabrina? Do we hate Sabrina because she reminded us so much of ourselves, of who we are as a living soul? Stubborn, believed that we write our own fate, tempered with things that made us suffer the pain in the end?<br/><br/>I'm not going to touch upon the gore bits and the satanic beliefs of the show, it is what made the show dark and different from Sabrina the Teenage Witch. I'm certainly not going to touch on the scripts, the actors and the cinematics as well as the special effects. That is for you to judge yourself. As for me, I'm fine with all that, for now.<br/><br/>I see in some episodes that the minor characters are descendants of Greendale's original lineages. They have their own special characteristics that are yet to be developed and I hope I soon see it in the next season.<br/><br/>For now, season 1 may lack in a lot of parts but still good enough to get me engaged all the way to the end. I have no hate for this show just more hope that it will develop better. There always room for improvements and imperfections. Nothing is ever perfect, and that's what made life interesting. I absolutely loved this show (first season) I've already watched it twice so far. Can not wait for the second season to be released on Netflix. Although I wish there was more than 10 episodes per season. But overall a great show that Netflix put out. Haters are gonna hate, but they're missing out. Can't wait until season 2! Just got done binge watching this show. I gotta say this show is awesome. Every show you see it's good vs evil or one or the other. This one is satanic and has cannibalism in it sorta. I believe this show being so dark is what makes the show. Also most people wont like the show because it's so dark. But you cant make a remake of a show if it's the same stuff from the original it wont be any good or keep it interesting. I hope they keep this show going! if you're interested in watching it but it might be too dark. Just watch it all the way through so you at least understand the story. Bunch of fun. Love the take on the comic, and Ambrose is definitely one of my favorite characters. Love what they did with Sabrina and glad they made her a stronger character. The one thing that makes it great is that is nothing alike Melissas Joan Hart Show. The creepy story and the Bible relates makes Sabrina (2018) a powefull new serie, well played by all the actors. Kiernan Shipke is a delight. After watching the first episode, I can't imagine a different actress for the role of Sabrina. The show itself is well-written, and the cast all fit very well together. I am excited to have an entire season to watch, and am already psyched for season two! I love the new Sabrina, they did an excellent job except the political agendas. It would have been 10/10 if the show would leave politics out of it. The blurry camera scenes are annoying also but I can deal with that. I am looking forward to season 2 but hopefully it will not have political messages in it. This was a great tv show to watch . I fully enjoyed it.
Omg i cant wait for more episodes to come. The darker thing modern tv and film like to do normally bores me but this I liked. It still had a fun flair too it whilst being dark and promoting the kind of message Sabrina was always meant to send The show is breathtaking. It lack a proper focus i agree but in a nutshell it is a blast to watch. Maan what really intriguing is the relationship of the sabrina aunts eith her .the complex relationship between hilda and zelda is just ahh They left just enough of the traits from 90's Sabrena charactors to make them recognizable, while replacing all the fluffy light hearted humor with a compelling gritty story that makes you turn off your mobile phone so you're not interupted!
The charactors are complex and layered in a way the original 90's show could never have acheived. The writing and acting is full of feeling, drawing you into the story and making you care for the charactors. This is a show about the lives of the charactors, not silly specialy effects and talking stuffed cats. Its a must see. Don't go in thinking you liked the old show which was funny and family friendly. This show it dark and interesting great concept! I liked it. It was full of adventure and darkness. First season was slow but good. There was not much spells as I expected but there was some spooky adventures like going to the limbo to bring a soul back to his body which kept me watching. But season 2 is way more better and spooky. In this season, when Sabrina's power grew beyond ordinary witch's ability, she began to enjoy her extraordinary powers. The 2 season is all about Sabrina searching for answers for who she really is ?
It is a fantasy series. Enjoy the darkness and spookiness ! I read the reviews, i see the stars and i'm surprized how many reviews are not that positive.
Agreed that some of the critic points are valid, i did bother at the editing with the blur (watch it and you know), but after a while, if you keep watching the series, it grows on you and you don't notice it that much anymore.<br/><br/>At some points i see other points that critics mention, but when i dig deep into my life in 1996, i remember the old series. You know, the comedy/kids-teevee kind of series. The "aah, she's cute" series!
Let's be honest, Sabrina looks as if she jumped out of "happy days"<br/><br/>And then i started to look at this serie another way, like it is the old series with a hidden Dark DLC addon.<br/><br/>Some epsiodes feel childish, but isn't that the point to connect to the old Sabrina series, and then put that evil dark twist on to it?<br/><br/>I like the serie, first season was interesting, second season was quite revealing.
Kiernan Shipka gives a damn good Sabrina, she has the cute innocent face of a teenage witch, but has that invisible evil well hidden for the good parts.<br/><br/>"Chilling Adventures of Sabrina" is a old fashioned serie from the 80's lived in the 21st century. When I started watching this I was expecting another basic boring trend series with bad acting and zero plot. But what I got was an interesting take on a classic series that's not afraid to get gory and a little creepy in places. The plot is easy to follow but gripping at the same time. Could do with a little more Salem tho. The series starts off excellently in the first episode. Sabrina's sixteenth birthday, and also the day of her Dark Baptism, approaches. As half mortal and half witch, Sabrina must choose between becoming a full witch or staying human. One path offers her power, one path offers her freedom. Can she also have both, though?<br/><br/>It has great acting from a wonderful cast, most noticably Kiernan Shipka as Sabrina, and Michelle Gomez and Miranda Otto as her aunt and her teacher, respectively.
The series' attention to aesthetics and cinematography is amazing as well. Especially the set designs for scenes in Sabrina's house and the Academy are exquisite.
The writing, however, is just terrible. I might even go as far as saying it's almost objectively bad. There are dozens of plot holes, most side characters are about as one-sided as cardboard cutouts, and in most episodes of the first season the main storyline and themes are abandoned to make place for high school drama with bland bullies. It felt like they only picked up the story's pace again in the last two episodes.<br/><br/>The quality of the writing AND of the characters increases substantially in the second season, though. If you pay attention, you can also see Shipka's ablities as an actress grow throughout the two seasons.
In short, the series has a likeable protagonists, compelling villains, and an engaging storyline. Combine this with stellar acting and good cinematography, and you have a fine show despite its flaws. No, it's nothing like the Sabrina the teenage witch from back in our way but I liked this BETTER!! I would much rather have this dark version instead of the family/comedy version. I don't understand why there are so many bad reviews. Aunt Zelda, Hilda, Father Blackwood, the teacher and Sabrina's acting are all on point. Watch & Enjoy! Reading some reviews of this saying "Disney kids movies are scarier than this" Sunni what Disney films these people watch. I only few episodes in but really enjoying it and yeah it's not Horror movie scary but it's not tame and not for children! It's campy, fun and dark. Not sure why everyone is so offended by this show? Its just a cute teen show but with some gore and lots of dark lord groupies. I say give it a go and make your own decision here. I'm probably in the unpopular opinion, but I really love the show. It definitely has dark humor and the show itself is much darker than the original. I do not care for this Aunt Zelda at all, but all of the characters that were in the original show definitely capture the essence of the original cast and add their own spin to them.<br/><br/>Some of the plots and episodes can be a little cheesy, but that's fine. Overall, the dark tone mixed with the humor makes me happy. Some things were definitely ripped off from other shows/movies, but who doesn't do that anymore? I see some people saying Sabrina has Twilight ripoffs. I'd like to point out that those Twilight ripoffs were ripoffs from White Wolf's Vampire: The Masquerade, who in turn probably ripped their ideas off from someone else, etc. There is one demon who also looks exactly like the hagravens from Skyrim in this show.<br/><br/>One warning I will give to folks because this may bother some people: this show really does revolve heavily around the worship of Satan. While I couldn't care less in the slightest, I know there are people who most likely find stuff like that offensive. They really "praise the Dark Lord" heavily in this show.<br/><br/>My conclusion is if you're looking for a show similar to Charmed or the original Sabrina series, you won't find it here. If you're looking for something with huge dark undertones and dark humor, you will definitely find that with CAOS. If you do decide to watch it, do yourself a favor and watch at least the first three episodes. The show does start out very slowly, especially with episode one. It picks up afterwards. I am still watching it but I think I have enough to say It's very well done. The actress is gorgeous and she plays Sabrina very well. I haven't seen much of the sitcom but I think from what I have seen that this new adaptation from the comics is top notch and I want to read them now. I think it has given me more appreciation for Archie comics. Please keep this goinf This show is so fun and well-made. I honestly don't understand all the reviews saying it's political... it's just diverse... there's no agenda.
I can't wait for season two. All I can say is everyone should watch it and it's just amazing, binge watched the whole series and can't wait for more! Great story, lots of blood and uncensored moments that help fortify the "Chilling" part of the show. It is definitely NOT childish and definitely NOT cringe-worthy which I am sure a lot of people would have assumed.<br/><br/>The cast is really good and it definitely left me longing for season 2! I love the feminist Sabrina. I like the political statements the serie does, and I also enjoy the adventures she goes through! One of the freshest teenybopper series with the right amount of macabre and horror that it's not a turnoff or horrifically scary, it's a must watch in my opinion!!
Thanks to its cast of fun characters,strong sense of atmosphere and interesting plot. Sabrina rises above its uneven pace and numerous cliches. The part that is intruiging is sabrinas story and her journey into womanhood as a witch. I won't give spoilers but it is a fun ride so far and draws you in the more you watch it but... the parts with the friends having civil rights issues with society is ridiculous. I don't think the content manor is bad but just seems forced. Sabrina is dealing with some of the most evil things someone can imagine. And all the while she finds time to care about descrimination in highschool? So they create a club called "wicca" that seems to be a pc driven club that sabrina somehow has time to care about. Idk about you but i know i wouldn't be enjoying a club at this point in time. And the more they go back and forth between the witches it just makes you wish all her friends would die accept her boyfriend. Who i feel will eventually be a big part of her story. I think id care more about these characters if the first impression you got of them wasn't "feel sorry for me" and somehow sabrina who is confident,smart and pretty. Leads this group. It is laughable and i wish they would just forget about her friends. I think if you stick with the story it will eventually get better. Just don't focus to much on her school life as it don't really offer any essence to her being a witch. I do think the witch part of this show is a solid 8 and it seems to be getting better. The director is going to see a barage of hate comments for doing cliche hollywood liberal propaganda. Hopefully the show learns from it and does better character development. I absolutely loved this show. As a witch, I found it highly humorous and loved the general style of the whole thing. This Sabrina is amazing; innocently wicked, intelligent and powerful! Amazing show! Hurry up and give us season 2!!!! I love this show. It's much darker than the original. First things first this is a show based off the COMIC BOOK OF THE SAME name. This has VERY LITTLE to do with the original Archie comics from years past and NOTHING to do with the old sitcom from the 90s. This show would appeal more to fans of Buffy than those of the old Sabrina sitcom<br/><br/>One thing I'm confused by though; Why at times does it seem like it takes place in the 60s only to turn around and see people using cell phones and laptops??<br/><br/>Anyways, the show has decent writing and acting, nothing groundbreaking but certainly entertaining. It really pulls you into their world. The acting is outstanding I wasn't sure what to expect but I really love the adult tone of this teen story. The supporting actresses really shine and makeup for the lackluster actress who plays Sabrina. She's very monotone and expressionless. At least Melissa joan hart had some spunk. Prudence is the star and is mesmerizing on screen; as are the aunts and other witches. Great job. For the first free episodes I hated this show. The acting was bad, Sabrina felt whiny and whiteout much agency. The awful, extremely forced Patriarchy, social justice stuff didn't help at all too.
After episode 4, however, the show picked up and was definitely a lot more fun. It was even truly engaging and surprising at times. Some issues did persist, mostly a lack of focus but I'm excited for upcoming seasons. This is literally the best serial ever!!!!!!! It is scary and funny, I loved it.
Well, spoilers: it is too scary and satanic for children under 16 (in my opinion). It gets scarier later on. In one episode there were shown nightmares. Can be really disturbing. Some kisses and flirting, but not too much. I really didn't want to watch this, but I'm a big Michelle Gomez fan and I really Like Kernan Shipka from Madmen. After the first ep I was hooked! Love the Dark themes, love the characters and the diversity of the casting. I really enjoyed watching and will anxiously await the next season! If it wasn't for the √Ç¬´ woke √Ç¬ª madness and nail on the head symbolisms, the show would be really enjoyable. Unfortunately it is so filled with agendas and subliminal messages, it takes all the fun out of it. And make the heroine, and her actress's mimics, really irritating. Strangely enough, it also suffers from an extremely high level of fan pandering writing. And I sometimes feel like I'm watching some √Ç¬´ ship era √Ç¬ª trend show, where the characters keep repeating how they refuse to be your usual clich√É¬©. Only they are, just by desperately trying not to be. The horror/gore is silly. Making the show perfect for Halloween, but irrelevant in other times. Really it has a lot of resemblances with the original series. Only it takes itself too seriously, to be genuinely appreciated. Millennials in a nutshell... Oops. I love this show. It is darker and very different than the original version but I like it more than the original version. I binge watch the entire season when it came out. I eagerly await the third season. I am not a teenager:<br/><br/>Sabrina is the perfect representation of a child who thinks she knows it all. Teens can learn from her and young adults can see a part of themselves in her. This is better than Riverdale! I don't really know the "original" Sabrina show from 20 years ago soi can't tell anything about similarities or differences. but if you are looking for comedy then turn away. if there is humor at all its usually pretty dark stuff. of course this isn't a bad thing. the tone of the show fits perfectly with the story and i really enjoy watching it. there are only a couple of things i really don't like.
some decisions people make and some dialog is completely BS. like people given "funny" remarks in dangerous situations where thats the last thing you would be thinking about. it doesn't improve the show or situation, it just makes your eyes roll. luckily those situations are rare enough to not destroy the show.
i would give the show something like an 7.7 maybe for the first season. I like it. This new version of Sabrina releases more of the main characters background. It's shows a whole new version of Sabrina. It conveys what Sabrina challenges she faced and what she was forced to do and how she changed adding more details of her background and personality. The first season may sound a little nastalgic and confusing comparing it to the old one though this one takes on a whole chilling and intresting adventure. It's a whole new story. Giving more information about the church she went to, her parents, and her relationships. It's a great show series if your a fan of somthing that's a mix of scary, thriller, and fiction. I'd recommend to add it to your watch list √∞≈∏Àú‚Ä∞ and enjoy the series. The 90's sitcom was more or less for children and family fun. This "Sabrina" is for a more adult audience. Very dark, sometimes a little too broody with season one. A first season is always meant to lay a foundation for the series. Get the audience familiar with the characters and the underlying story. This show does that and does it pretty well. If you're patient and take the time to watch the first season to the end you see its a fantastic witchy tale. a kind of exquisite Dark game of cat and snake. The Dark Lord wants to claim his Queen in Sabrina but Miss Wardwell wants the position for herself. So she begins moving everyone in Sabrina's life around like pawns with the intention of bumping the half witch out of the way and becoming the Dark ones right hand.<br/><br/>Watching Sabrina come into her own as a mature young woman and witch is entertaining indeed. And Shipka plays the part to perfection. Her light set against Wardwells darkness is balanced out with the Aunts who are polar opposites of each other in every way. However they seem to walk the line between darkness and light. Giving the show a fair amount of comic relief.<br/><br/>Season 2, in my opinion, superior to season 1. Because the battle Sabrina seems really be fighting is between her nature and the darkness that's inside her.<br/><br/>it's like Charmed crossed over into a season of American Horror Story. Ya gotta love it. I loved the orginal from the 90's and even though this is a darker version I love this just as much. The show empowers women in many ways. As a feminist, I highly appreciate to see female actresses in the leading roles. Personally, I assume, this show is worth to watch even for 2 characters: Ms Wardwell and Zelda. Great to observe how they evolve and become very determined in their own paths. I liked it overall and want to conclude my review with one of my fav quotes.
Ms. Wardwell: "When will the world learn? Women should be in charge of everything." The show is good. For teenagers and adults also. But the main actress...this girl is ....oh well,let's just say i would've loved to see someone else in Sabrina's role. She is not attractive at all,she may be talented,but i just can't get over her surface image. But the series is truly ok,and even if i can't even look at Sabrina,i watch it cause the plot is good,the other characters are amazing and Miranda Otto is LOVELY!
And i've created an account because i wanted to express the fact that i wished someone else was taking the leading role. P This is a great show. From the Easter eggs referring to other horror movies and franchises, to the entire air of the show, the excellent cast, all add up to an excellent and fun show. Love it can't wait to watch season 2.
When i watch the last episode of the season i was wishing season 2 was up there to watch. If you haven't seen it, give it a chance and watch it. Especially if you're a fan of the older sabrina series. I love this! If people want it to be a remake it isn't! I can't wait for season 2! I don't know why some here is whining about the remake, if you wanted it to be the same then go and watch the old series. This Netflix version is like the upgrade story to actually include some horror stuff not for kids- and as an adult ( not a teen) I loved it, the characters, story and acting. Can't wait to see part 2 when it's all getting dark. Just watch it. Nothing like any Sabrina we have seen before. Adult and fascinating. I love this show, it does not skimp on the story line and the writers are very creative. Can't wait to see Sabrina get her boyfriend back. This is not a fake feeling series like most, the casting is great and the lead actress is so mature and fearless , I love her I watched the first episode with an open mind. Yes I grew up watching the sitcom but the thought of a remake of the programme to be more in line with the comics really appealed to me.
My opinion is that it's fantastic. It's dark and sometimes gory but every character is really strong. For me, Lucy Davis as Hilda absolutely kills it! She is amazing!
I'm not suggesting that the show is perfect, it isn't but it is well written and delivers.
I've binged watched the first series and am counting the days until the next!
Give it a chance, you may love it as much as I do! This show is a true sign of the times. It is Dark and sometimes scary. It is hard to be certain who the good guys and the bad guys are. The cast is a diverse mixture of folks that accurately reflect the society of today's America. The spooky, occult weirdness is delightful. This is not a show for little kids but anyone from mid-teens to adults will find plenty to be interested in. The production value is excellent and the richness of the visuals will immerse you in a magical world. Not being a massive fan of horror, I wasn't sure what to expect with this series, but I found myself hooked and watched all the episodes in a matter of 48 hours.<br/><br/>Other reviews emphasised the 'feminist' and 'political' agendas which they felt took over the show and made it more about that then the story line / characters. I admit that earlier episodes do have a element of that, but not to the extent that the complexity of the characters and their situations are overshadowed by it.<br/><br/>The duality of Sabrina, who has been brought up around witches but has had the opportunity to live a mortal(ish) life, is what I find the most fascinating.
She is a strong, opinionated woman, willing to challenge the ideals of those around her, yet is still a teenage and can be manipulated by those she trusts. She also has to face consequences for her actions, whatever the intention may have been to begin with.<br/><br/>This, I feel, makes Sabrina relatable ; who of us, as a teenager, didn't think we had all the answers? Who could be manipulated by friends and peer pressure? Who didn't think we were 'untouchable' and 'indestructible' but have had to face the consequences of our youthful choices?<br/><br/>Plus, who doesn't love Ambrose?<br/><br/>I can't wait for season 2! After watching the disappointing first episode of the rebooted Charmed, I thought this was going to be bad too. But I was pleasantly surprised and I immediately loved this new Chilling Adventures of Sabrina series! I loved every episode, all the storylines and the actors. The only thing I didn't like was that Salem doesn't have a bigger part in all the series (except that one against the scarecrow which was awesome!)
I'm really looking forward to season 2! Can't wait! So far I have found it to be a good take on a classic series. This new take is dark if this offends you do not watch. It does get a little political but not much that you can't get past. We live in a time that absolutely everything on TV has some form of political insight either you enjoy it for what it is and put the political Parts behind you or you just watch stuff that relates to your party. Although you may being denying yourself something that you really enjoy. So far the cast is good and acting is good, the show has my attention for now. Pilot slow to get going but picks up well, much darker than the show it's rebooted from and at times much more mature orientated. Writing this review after the 2nd episode I can say it's worth sticking with as it is eminently watchable. 1. The production is on point.
2. Acting is very decent
3.directing is great!
4. Writing is pretty decent
5. Characters fit right in<br/><br/>This gives you a modern day, dark twist on teen shows while paying homage to scary movies from the 80's and 90's. It has a "Jason" feel to it. I'm in love because they don't hold back on the darkness but the darkness isn't overwhelming. I will be savoring it and not binge it so that it can last longer. A story about witches should be dark. It's also very cool, not pretentious and that's a plus when doing something like this; it needs to be authentic. I recommend 100%. At the beginning, I also was confused if that programm was for kids or teenagers. You need time to catch the feeling and to start enjoying the characters. It's another version of Sabrina, more innocent but with so much passion. All the actors are amazing and the the director has great point of view, magical and mysterious. I really liked the show. The whole atmosphere and the direction were amazing I really liked the blurry effect in each scene. The Satan worshipping
was amusing, acting was pretty good but some actors do need improvement. Overall I loved it and I'm looking forward to seeing the next season! A must watch for horror fans! Surprisingly well made horror series, for sure not the kids show it once were. Loved it! Best halloween show! Can't wait for mire seassons! The entire cast is so compelling. Each one is so wonderful in her/his role - Bravo.
And the story is a sheer fun.
That's a heartwarming show I loved this episodic. So anxious for the next one! The show is worth watching in Netflix, as it stands up between the rest of the TV Shows Netflix produces each year.<br/><br/>The protagonist Shipka, is a very talented actress, considering her age,
as is Miranda Otto (Zelda).<br/><br/>Each episode is interesting in its own way, and not boring.<br/><br/>It combines two genres that of horror and that of comedy, brilliantly.
I wish Season 2 is released even faster, because I have become a fan of the show. A show with a story that leaves you questioning and wondering. I could hardly wait to get home and watch the next episode to see where it leads next. Definitely a series worth watching. I have to admit that my expectations were pretty low, however this series turned out to be so much fun, and spooky as hell! I found myself sad as I began the last episode because I wanted to keep watching the delightfully twisted characters. The plot is great, and so is the cast, and I am looking forward to Season 2! The show is great, and honestly kept me invested throughout, I found the development of the plot went at a good pace, the characters were all interesting and none of them seemed annoying. But the season felt small and honestly felt rushed like they had been forced to push the episodes down. There were some self contained stories that I felt did really well, but because of the small amount of episodes I feel like those episodes could of been better used to spread the story out further.<br/><br/>Also my big problem is with the high priest, and minor spoiler, but why is the high priest the head master, the lawyer, and the what I thought was the equivilant of the pope for their coven? It feels like they didnt want to write in more characters so just gave him every leadership role imaginable, there should of been seperate characters for the headmaster, a seperate character for the lawyer and kept him as a mysterious High Priest, perhaps the high priest could of acted in Satans place at the Court instead of being the lawyer himself.<br/><br/>PS Please godforbid let there not be a riverdale crossover We started watching it thinking it would be like the old Sabrina, but boy were we wrong! It was twisted and dark, but so so awesome. I really hope it stays on for more seasons!!! I don't understand why some people hate it.It's worth ten!!!!!! I love these actors very much.Especially Kiernan!!!She must be a superstar in the future. Yearning for something smart, yet on the dark side, Sabrina is just that. Reminiscent of Grimm, monsters and demons galore. Very smartly done, with odd twists and interconnecting storylines. I wasn't expecting it to be this good! It's like a darker Harry Potter. Michelle Gomez's performance is incredible, great acting all around, visually and atmospherically stunning, brilliant characters, and an epic season finale! This show is fire! Im surprise at the satan related comments.
not as good as season 0ne True Blood or Dexter.
I guess a mix of teenage to adult viewers demography .
Can Have been much darker.
recommended .
Also watch German version of Dark. Can't wait to watch more! So many ups and downs! Twists and turns you really don't know where the story is going to go! Very interesting. Not a huge fan of the Satanic worship but they are witches sooooo what do you expect lol I grew watching Sabrina the teenage witch so I was curious what they were going to do with it. They had a dark take on it, it reminded me of that show they released a couple years ago called the circle. It was entertaining as well as, not making it so easy as guess the end of show. The only thing I wish they would of done was make me feel more connected to the characters, I didn't really care for them. It's still a good show to binge watch in the fall...maybe even for Halloween. Firstly, how they managed to make Kiernan Shipka look frumpy and all, is beyond me, but they did. Her character was up there with the most annoying teen angst, selfish, Juliet take poison for her beloved Romeo, kiss like an octopus suction cup, character I have ever watched. Poor Shipka, to be cast this way. Hope they paid her enough<br/><br/>Yes, yes, it is political, preachy, progressive but in short doses here and there. People complaining about this need to remind themselves they are watching escapism and fantasy, not some Barak Obama speech on all that is good about the Left. It's not real people, GET A GRIP.<br/><br/>The other characters were pretty good actors in a fantasy show and did there job well, all very likeable. And they did not go overboard with CGI which was nice, they tried to tell a fairytale mostly free of Hulk, Captain America, Thor and Star Trek. And when they did use them, they fit the scene.<br/><br/>It all COMES TOGETHER in the last 2 episodes, in particular, the last episode when Sabrina finally does the right thing to save her friends and her town from an Apocalypse rider and some nasty hanging fruit witches from the past.<br/><br/>At the end, they leave you with a final scene that there is much more to anticipate from this series. And, they almost made poor Shipka look as pretty as she is in real life and not the frumpy teen that she was up until then.<br/><br/>Finally and to me, it was good escapism, fantasy and fairytale of sorts. I like it for what it is and hope they renew it for another season. As the title says and also really enjoyable to bingewatch. Waiting for the second season, because with this one i'm not feeling to say if it's a good/bad serie. I like the show, but I have to play with the settings on my TV way too much just to have a glimpse of what I'm watching.<br/><br/>I have a year old Samsung UHD TV, so it's not the tech. Wish they'd record more during the day, dusk, early morning hours, so I can see what's actually going on instead of guessing. After episode 4 this show finds it's feet. It was a little slow to get going but once it does then I was hooked. This is why I gave it an 8/10. I really want to see more now I have finished. I am no horror fan, but this has some major redeeming features in my view. I like the diverse supporting cast: non-binary kid (or trans... they don't explicitly say yet but I am guessing nb) and a bad-ass black girl who fights for her rights. The fantasy adventure aspect wad balanced well with the horror, which did not cross the line in either gore (just off camera) or despair. The script is reasonably well written if you don't mind when camp is played up on occasion. I will probably check out the next season when it is out. I really enjoyed this show I can't wait for season 2 I know it sounds kind of crazy to call Netflix's reboot of Sabrina The Teenage Witch "ground breaking". But given its adherence to the excellent source material (Afterlife With Archie/Chilling Adventures), and unflinching exploration of Satanism as a legitimate philosophy, that's exactly what it is. There is so much this show does right; the lead character is a strong female protagonist, but without the hangups of a tumultuous love life. Instead, her relationship is rock solid, and healthy. Throughout the course of the show she also seeks to uplift her fellow witches, even as they may attempt to tear her down.
The acting here is pretty much universally exceptional, and the technical aspects are fun as well. In particular, the lighting creates incredible mood and a surplus of cool looking shots, greatly augmenting whatever the low-ish (it is Netflix after all) production values of TV. Highly recommend to fans of Buffy, Riverdale, or the occult in general. I had high expectations coming into this because Kiernan Shipka was amazing in 'Mad Men.' What I didn't expect was the superb supporting cast, with Miranda Otto and Lucy Davis excelling as the salt and pepper aunts. Michelle Gomez almost steals the show with her deliciously evil, almost campy turn as teacher Mary Wardwell. The best thing is that the show doesn't take itself too seriously; the actors seem to be having fun. But it's Shipka who carries the series; her combination of strength and ingenuity is not an easy thing to pull off but Shipka delivers big time. You need to be a fan of her character for this show to work and Shipka pulls at your heartstrings, empowers you and makes the whole thing a fun and illuminating adventure. (As an aside, the Paramount theatre, shown at the beginning of the series, is actually a lap dance club in New Westminster BC.) From the creators of Riverdale with the same cool aesthetic, delivers the chills that a teenager series need!!!!! I always am skeptical about remake but this one I find quite good. It is not the TV show that we were used to from before. The show tends to be dark and there is not very much humor in it however it had kept me interested. I love dark stories anyway and this did not disappoint. Kiernan play a good Sabrina with a good mix of high school innocence and darkness. I watched the first 5 episodes on a plane and can't wait to watch the remaining on my return flight. I cannot stoping watching it! It takes 1 year to release the Season 2, which is sooooo bad. I cannot wait to wathc the Season 2. I never watched the original sitcom so I cannot compare. I was afraid this was going to turn out like riverdale and I was very pleasantly surprised! Obviously this is a teenager fantasy show so don't expect too much, however the characters were well made and (most) their actions made sense (UNLIKE RIVERDALE). A bit of cheese and a bit of spooky, but overall a fun watch. This is a pretty good TV show, great feel of a throwback TV horror story, fun to watch. However, this by all means deserves a TV MA rating. Many appropriate scenes in each episode. As a parent, only for 16 and up. Honestly, this show has immediately become a favorite of mine. People are putting too much stock into some parts and reading into stuff wayyyyyy too much.<br/><br/>This show has representation for nearly everyone without entirely shoving it down your throat. It's 2018 and people need to stop getting upset when shows are trying to be representative of all people.<br/><br/>The cast is AMAZING and I'm honestly thrilled with all the actors. I think it's made the show that much better. The storyline is fantastic and it's such a great twist on the very basics of the sitcom.<br/><br/>It's not the same as the sitcom, and people need to realize that this is dark, it's gritty, and it's like Supernatural meets Stranger Things and it's absolutelt amazing. Cannot wait for the next season. My first Review. I must say, that the first thing that came to my mind when i saw the title was, something like "Riverdale" and i'm not a huge Fan of such kind of Series. But then I still gave it a shoot, because i saw that this should be a Horror like series. And i need to say, IT WAS GODLIKE. I mean they could do it better, yes but still i was happy to watch it, and Sabrina is just awsome in her role. Of course it could be more "Horrorish" and so on but still it got me really right.<br/><br/>I would give it a 8,5 because it could be better. But hey i finished the first season in one day so :D I don't know why Netflix labelled this a drama, unless they meant melodrama! All of the characters are (ha!) like they're out of a comic book -- I'm not being funny here, the show does its best to try to _be_ serious, but all of the overacting and general silliness makes it feel much more like The Addams Family than Penny Dreadful.<br/><br/>The witches here appear to be Satanists, which if you're a stickler for occult detail is bound to displease. It's set in the 60s... except when it's not, and it's set in 2014(?) There's a gay witch (which is cool, don't get me wrong) and a feminism group at Sabrina's high school, but the parents and teachers are all 1960s caricatures (...?) But despite all of that weirdness, as a show (a horror/comedy anyway) it works.<br/><br/>But it's not a drama (or at least not a good one) and it's not scary. So do what thou wilt with it... Netflix: Ruing your childhood 1 character at a time √∞≈∏Àú‚Äö
If you liked the original Sabrina you'll love this one Honestly I don't think this show is super bad. Yes it is political, and let's be honest, the first episode is terrible. Once getting to the next few episodes, this show is great!!! Please give it a chance, because you won't regret it This show is one of the best Netflix has ever released! Right next to the haunting of hill house! Kinda good but I hated the actress who played Sabrina Overall, this show is basically what is promised. It's a darker take on Sabrina the Teenage Witch, and from what I understand is pretty true to the comics.<br/><br/>The production design is amazing. It pulls you right in, and feels like the perfect setting for this kind of story to take place.<br/><br/>I'm only 4 episodes in, and so far my biggest issue is one of the aunts, Zelda I believe. They've written her character to deliver exposition with every other line, and it's over the top and unbelievable. Very forced. The characters she's communicating what is happening and why to, in a very explicit manner, should be clear to those characters, considering their standing within this world.<br/><br/>Also, most of the male characters are pretty hollow, one dimensional, and stereotypical. There's strong feminist overtones throughout, some of which hinder the story more than they help it, but overall they make sense.<br/><br/>I've seen a lot of people complaining about the "blurry" dream-like effect that is used pretty often. I think this is actually done pretty well and makes sense from what I've seen.<br/><br/>Anyhow, I've found it to be an enjoyable watch thus far, despite its flaws, and am looking forward to seeing how the season plays out. I'm gonna be honest, I have some mixed feelings about "Chilling Adventures of Sabrina". On one hand, I loved the story and the vibe of the whole show. The perfect mixture of horror with some action and comedy really got me excited and craving more! On the other hand, the show has very weak writing, for the first few episodes at least. For the first half of the season, I just couldn't help, but notice that the conversations between the characters are very awkward and shallow and that not only worsened some of the acting, since it was clearly unnatural, it also affected the plot. The WICCA idea was very noble and I see what they were trying to do, but it was very forced and poorly executed, making it unnecessary (for now at least depends what the second season will bring). I couldn't fully immerse myself in the show since every once in a while the dialogue would distract me or the story seemed too bland. However, as the show progressed, it just kept getting better. I'm not sure if there were changes made in their team or the writers suddenly gained new writing skills, but it improved the show greatly! The story suddenly shifted, becoming much darker and more exciting. The dialogue improved and the cringe worthy conversations became a distant memory and, through elaborate story writing and meaningful conversations, the characters suddenly became actual people with whom you can relate, not just tools to convey a story. With each episode I just became more and more addicted, to the point where I was legitimately sad when I finished the show, and that's always a good sign! While the first few episodes may have been bumpy, the overall show was great with incredible story, characters and cinematography. This show had great potential to be something fresh and exciting and while only second half of the show met that expectation, I can't wait to see what Sabrina has stored for us in the future. This new iteration of an old comic book series is crafted with a dark morbidity that I adore. Don't come here if you're looking for the fun, campy, finger-pointing-heavy kitsch of the original series (which I loved, excluding the abysmal final season, anyway...).<br/><br/>This series gets everything right, from the awesome, diverse cast to the deft blend of horror and old-school styling/aesthetic.<br/><br/>My only real gripe is the way the series gets a bit hokey in the way it flips the morality script (e.g., "For the love of God" becomes "For the love of Satan," etc...). It's not bad, per se, but it feels a little silly sometimes for a show that's being as serious as this one tries to be.<br/><br/>Regardless, I am delighted at how well this series has turned out, and I look forward to more! Note: I've never seen the earlier versions of this show, or read any of the comics. It could be how I'm able to totally love this show, I don't know.
As a total newcomer to this story and characters, I find the show to be great fun. It's got a cool balance of very dark and very light, reminding me fondly of how it felt watching "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" back in the 90s. Hip, youthful, honest. It feels both modern and ancient, all at once. It deals with evil further than most shows ever do, yet somehow always keeps good morals, and good, heroic, and kindly actions of the brave teens. (Even mean Auntie Zelda grows on you and I think she's got a good heart inside, lol.). I love that there are 3 main characters who are strong single women in their 40s or 50s.... I'm just gonna say it, I love that they can be stunning and/or sexy WITHOUT any really obvious plastic surgery. I hope more and more films will show the world what it looks like to age well, FINALLY FOR WOMEN TOO! I like REAL faces.
I enjoy the cousin that lives there, Ambrose...usually quite funny. Most of the main actors are great!
I don't really care for the boyfriend, Harvey. He's so weak and uninteresting and shows little reason for Sabrina's deep love and devotion. I think the problem is sort of a reverse-sexist one...the women are strong and smart, while the men are stupid and weak. It seems like that is going backwards! ...come on writers of the world, can't a super hero's boyfriend be strong and smart too? (Lois Lane was!)Slowly tv/movieshave let female assistants show their strengths. Don't make men go backwards.
I like Susie's confusion about her sexuality, and I hope she keeps on learning that femininity has its strength too. She's interesting. I bet most people relate well to this character... sometimes you may feel more feminine, sometimes more masculine. I like that for the most part, sexuality in general isn't a big deal in this show. And when it is, its to show bullies and how to stop them!!.
One of my favorite characters is Ms. Wardswell. That actress is amazing! I just adore this crazy, awesome, wild looking woman. I know and love the actress from Doctor Who (Missy). She's perfect in this show. (They should try getting the actor that played The Master in Doctor Who too!!). She can steal a scene with just a facial expression. She's great!
I don't mind it because my faith is strong and I love sci-fi and horror stories, but I will say this show goes very dark sometimes with the evil, hailing satan, cannibalism, etc, but that's part of the point I guess. It is a horror show!
Overall I really enjoy this show. I hope in the future there can be some males who are strong too without cruelty. It wouldn't take anything away from the kickass women of the show to have a few men like that too. Harvey's brother almost was (very brave and strong and kind). No spoilers though!
I wouldn't recommend this show for kids or teens, it's very adult even though most of the characters aren't. The storytelling and acting was great. I would love to hear Salem speak next season... it is possible as we learned in the last seconds...<br/><br/>For those complaining about the feminism.. well it is a show about women in powerful positions, so I don't know what you were expecting.<br/><br/>My only complaints are the blurry edges in the camera perspective and that there are no lesbians.<br/><br/>Worth a watch! I like this show, its fun to watch.
I really like Sabrinas character and hope she and Nick will have a thing in season 2. I see many comments are disliking this show cuz of politic or transgender people and thats just funny, its a show, deal with it.
If u like horror/teen shows u will really like it. When I first heard about this new thrilling T.V show, I wasn't really to sure how it would be? I questioned it but as I started watching it day by day, I really got to enjoy it! If anybody likes a weird, thrilling, dark show, then this is it for you!! Brilliant cinematography, special fx and story telling. Did not expect it to be so spooky, twisted and gory. Truly one of the best TV shows out now. I think this show is pretty great with everything that I would want in a new horror show. A girl who's half witch and half human trying to navigate her way through both worlds. The idea of recall the comic strip atmosphere is a winner.
The tone is perfect: horrorific but not too much, raw, dramatic and sometimes funny.
Nice settings. Sabrina's house is beautiful, yet disturbing and rich of details.
Engaging characters as Sabrina's aunts, her two girl friends, Ambrose, Madam Satan and Prudence. They all have well build personalities, played by perfect actors.<br/><br/>And here's the bad not-so-little part: Sabrina herself.
I'm not a fan of Kiernan Shipka's work (or the director's). I think they didn't do a good job with her character. At all.
Sabrina is flat, serious and boooring. She should have been a little bit more witty and - why not - disturbing.
She can kill people and throw curses, she has to be a little bit crazier, don't you think? I would have LOVED a more ambiguous Sabrina.
They should have taken some humor from the Sabrina played by Melissa Joan Hart (just a little).
The only perfect thing about her is the way she looks. I have really enjoyed this show. It is entertaining, and well paced. Kiernan Shipka is wonderful, as always and the supporting cast is excellent as well. I was surprised to see so many bad reviews because I find it to be quite engaging, a perfect mix of drama, horror and comedy. Looking forward to season 2! Ok America, hear this out: the world is way bigger than you think and your modern day problems are children sized.<br/><br/>Yes, this is not a sequel to the original Sabrina series, it's a gory remake with a glimpse of what happens behind the goofy part of magic, which all you snowflakes seem to forget about. Fun times are good times, but behind that s**t happens, and you get to see it. The dark tones and grim reality, although it's toned down a lot, are a much more appropriate way to tackle the day to day life of a witch.<br/><br/>The show is fun and enjoyable to watch !<br/><br/>
Characters. The cast is great, but I do agree with some of the reviews calling out the PC part of the show, which is just inserted in for the sake of it, not that it has any kind of connection to the rest of the world they're trying to paint. but, unlike most of you, I don't feel annoyed or angry or whatever the hell you are feeling about it, since I'm not from USA and things like these are of no consequence. Who cares about trans people or female empowerment or sexual orientation ?
And I mean that in a good way, because those concepts are just part of life, unlike in the US where they seem to be all you can talk about.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The show is fun and enjoyable to watch !<br/><br/>Continuing the rant about the majority of comments:<br/><br/>I couldn't care less if gays or lesbians are getting it on with eachother, or some guy or girl decides he/she wants a sex change. It's none of my business to have an opinion about it and to enforce it on others. To each their own I say, everybody love everybody, we are facing planetary lack of resources and you're out there bickering about stupid issues.<br/><br/>And women can do almost everything a man can do, as men are able to do most of women can, get over it.<br/><br/>
What i really want to see and would push my star rating to 10/10 is Salem doing more badass things like taking out the scarecrow in the maze, that was awesome. The amount of detail into the occult information is amazing i was even wondering if the writers are members.. From eating babys , human sacrifice, etc.. im wondering if as the show progresses if sabrina starts becoming curious about the catholic church as she might need their help to defeat satan. but who ami but a writer not yet to this level of a show.. The orgies, and much of what was shown by my studies in the occult , seem very real after all it is a show. but hopefully it doesnt become a stale walking dead type situation. Theres alot they can do , but it would be interesting to see her become curious about the catholic church whic is steeped mystery and occult, as the church of satan....the writers seem to be doing great research and it is scary i mean if i was 15...LMAO...keep up the good work Cant wait for season 2, withces! and also cant wait for midwinter's tale!!!! I'm not massively impressed with Kiernan Shipka's preformance (though in fairness, I've only seen the pilot episode so far). She has a way of overacting emotional scenes that makes it difficult for me to watch without rolling my eyes, and the way she delivers her lines is, occasionally, hella unnatural. I'm also not entirely in love with this particular version of the character Sabrina Spellman. I think she comes across as a Mary Sue and it makes it difficult to really 'like' her. I'm far more invested in her cousin, Ambrose, to be honest.
I do think it's worth pointing out, however, that I watched "Sabrina the teenage with" as a kid, and it's difficult for me to not compare Shipka's Sabrina with the old Sabrina. I liked the old Sabrina. She was awkward and funny and she made mistakes and messed things up for herself and hilarity ensued.
Shipka's Sabrina - which I'm assuming is closer to the character from the the original comic (though I've never read it myself) - is far more mature, capable and confident, and while I certainly don't think it makes her a bad character (she makes an excellent role model for young women), I do think it takes away some of the awkward charm I've come to associate with the Sabrina from the 90s' sitcom. This show is NOT a particularly comedic show. It's full of youth-politics, often time preached in a way that is just... cringe-worthy. I mean, the intention behind it is good and all, but it's always a little bit embarrassing to watch teenagers pretend to be adults.
That said, I do think this series has plenty of potential and I find the overall cast rather pleasing. Definitely a show for teenagers rather than adults, I'd say, much like Riverdale. Worth a watch? Sure, if you have nothing better to do. It's a pretty fun show. (If you're above the age of 20, however, I'd say get ready to cringe. Things get a bit over the top at times.) I really enjoyed this version! I just remember the old show it was good too. This is a dark, grim series about Sabrina, a teenage witch. Not a family series, not humoristic, not a love story and certainly not a remake of the sitcom. For its genre it is currently pretty much one of the best fantasy / witch series out there. Easy to watch and not slow building. Salem, the cat, is still in there and has NOT been replaced by a black man as the other reviews say.<br/><br/>If you like Teen Wolf, Grimm, Supernatural, Riverdale, Lost Girl, Charmed, ... You will most likely be pleasantly surprised with this series. If you liked the original Sabrina and are looking for a comedy show, I advice you not to give this a shot as it is extremely different. I was very upset to see how they adapted Salem. After the third episode I realized I needed to let go of the sitcom and love this for what it was. Ok I must admit I wasn't a fan when I watched the first episode because I based my expectations on Sabrina the Teenage witch , WHICH YOU SHOULD NOT DO!<br/><br/>The producers picked and chose what parts they wanted from Sabrina the teenage witch such as characters names , Sabrina Spellman, Zelda , Hilda etc but there are huge differences in this show. Don't expect magic by the way because there's none of that in this. More spell casting rather than finger pointing.<br/><br/>I rated this a 7 because it's a hard to grasp show. The show is about satanic rituals and worshipping Satan - NOT TO FORGET I got a lot of Harry Potter vibes from this show. References to the Dark Lord made me think of Voldemort and the main actress looks a lot like Emma Watson. It's hard to get your head around the fact that they are worshipping the devil and that there are good devils and bad devils?! Sabrina is not the ditsy witch which you automatically expect based on the original Sabrina the teenage witch, she is a well educated character and you won't catch her fumbling in the ' magic spell book '.
I must admit , I felt a bit lost whilst I was watching this like is Sabrina a good devil worshipper ? Is she a bad worshipper ? Why does the devil want her so much? The whole empowering women, trans, racist , misogynistic issues in the first episode is all forgotten in the next couple of episode which I am thankful for because its a concept that just didn't fit in the show, it was as though producers were trying too hard to address worldly political affairs - YAWN.<br/><br/>On a more positive note - I despise horror things but I really enjoyed this. The decor , house , costumes , scenery are brilliant. I can't fault any of it and the use of graphics are fantastic. I don't get why Hilda is English. Also , because Salem doesn't talk AT ALL , Ambrose is there to compensate for that - I do like his character.<br/><br/>This is a good watch I am looking forward to season 2!! Let me start by saying It's refreshing to finally see a positive form of feminism cultural diversity and sexuality in a show for once.<br/><br/>If you feel they are pushing some kind off agenda I'd say try to look past that.
Although one might hope that in this day and age we might all be considered equal no matter the gender, sexuality or color of our skin.<br/><br/>This show has a lot of great things going on and it would be a shame to miss it.
The story is rich of thrill, drama, humor and all one could want from a show.<br/><br/>Spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>The only remark on the story i have in particulair, is the end sequence wherein sabrina walks beside the 3 witches conveying that she has chosen the darker side.<br/><br/>I hope they did this as a wind up for the next season. Hoping one might come.
Though I do feel its unnatural for the character that is portraied as sabrina.
But ofcourse this might all be part of the story that is ahead of us. which might tell us a fundamental change has been made by her signing the book. If this were the case and turn out to be irreversable it would be a shame.<br/><br/>I do hope the second season might involve sabrina finally taking her fate into her own hands. to somehow break free from the web of lies and manipulation that has been spun around her for the entire first season.<br/><br/>I also hope that the series gets more budget the second season to show us some more CGI magic or magic. As a show that is partly about magic i do feel just the slightest lack of magic and/ or magic related goings on.<br/><br/>For now i would like to end on the note saying. GO AND WATCH THIS SHOW.
And if you have already, I hope you enjoyed it as much as i do. The show is great. I love the show. I love how dark it is and how it's completely different from the original. I'm reading these other comments and the show never claimed to be a "remake." I think the writers made it known that it would be different. And obviously, from the cover art of the show, you can tell it's not going to be a witty comedy with a talking cat. So to the people who had a problem with the show not being funny, build a bridge and get over it.<br/><br/>The only problem I had was how Sabrina's life LITERALLY revolved around Harvey. Like sweet Jesus, we get that she loves him but COME ON! If you want to make a show where the women cast is strong then that's fine, but follow through. I just felt that everything she did throughout the season she was always worried what would Harvey think, or how can make my self lesser so Harvey can feel better about himself. I'm just so tired of seeing shows about a girl's life and when it comes to her boyfriend's life she has to bend over backward to make him feel better or stronger about himself. And Harvey's character was a little baby. I just felt like the entire season he was whining about something. When he kept calling himself "chicken s**t" he literally was. Now, I'm not saying to make him a douche bag, but can we make him a bit stronger next season.<br/><br/>AGAIN, love the show but Harvey is seriously a buzz kill. Plot and story is very interesting and colourful, acting was good. But the reasoning behind every action doesn't make sense. Too much political indeed for left-wing cause. Very good metaphor about religions as presented by the Church of Night and its traditions. I've been looking forward to watching this show and I'm not disappointed. I think the TV-14 rating is a little low, there's a lot of adult themes and pretty messed up stuff.. but as an adult that doesn't bother me.. younger me might have been a little traumatized.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed the acting, the visuals, the individual episode stories, and where they left it on the finale. So ready to see what's next for Sabrina! Don't be scared off by the negative reviews. The show is well written and well acted, it only loses a star because salem doesn't talk.<br/><br/>Now to address the negative reviews:<br/><br/>Many people seem to be put off by the diversity and the issues raised. I think this largely stems from the fact that until about 5 years ago, there weren't many minority characters on tv at all. So when a show has multiple ones now, it may be surprising. However, it isn't Hollywood trying to cram minorities into the show, it's just them representing the population like they should have been doing all along. Some reviewers on here make it seem like every good character is a minority being hunted by an evil conservative boogey man. This isn't the case:
<ul><li>there are two prominent black characters</li><li>there are two LGBTQ characters (one of whom is also one of the black characters)</li></ul>That's it. Hardly a "cornucopia of minorities" as one reviewer put it. A good rule of thumb I think is if a reviewer can only complain about the characters' orentation, ethnicity, gender etc., than the show itself is probably pretty good. I was very pleasantly surprised about this show. I haven't tried Riverdale because the mere thought of Archie repulses me but I think I will at least give it a shot now.
I love how dark this show is. And with episodes clocking in at around a real hour each, there's a lot of development every single episode. It's a relatively short season at 10 episodes but one must keep in mind that each episode flows directly from the last, and in run time it's more like 14 episodes on traditional TV. And amazingly, I found some scenes genuinely creepy, or just delightfully horrible.
Some downsides include Sabrina's rather flat and uninteresting friends - but I can totally get over that - and most importantly, Harvey both as a character and how he's portrayed. He has very few redeeming features and is constantly obsessed about not being a coward - it's almost like Marty in BTTF being unable to resist a challenge whenever someone calls him chicken. Except in that case it was supposed to be funny.
This Harvey has very little intellect, charm or personality. Maybe he's like that in the comics but seriously... Ross Lynch and Kiernan Shipka have no chemistry whatsoever, and nor do the characters themselves. There's literally no reason for them to be together, never mind 'love' each other so very much. There's never any moment where they truly connect as human beings. If you thought it might just be hormones, think again - that part is also evidently absent from the relationship, lol. It's just cringe worthy whenever they're in a scene together. At least that pervert witch guy seems clever.<br/><br/>Of course, the biggest mistake would be to compare this to the 90's sitcom (I personally hate sitcoms, and found the Sabrina one to be particularly uninteresting). I know nothing about the comics, but those two shows are nothing alike and I don't think they ever pretended to be.
Long story short, it's an easy 8 for me. I can't give a 9 because I've rated too many superior shows as 9, but that's about it. I like this series a lot. Finished it in two days. Love the allure, the overall vibe is menacing and freaky. But one thing ruins it all - Sabrina's ACCENT. For the love of satan, everyone in her family has a british/ old Hollywood accent and hers is just staight out Californian hard core. Like come on you're playing a freaking witch.. Every time I started to feel in the universe of the series, her accent just threw me out. Very sad for this lack of detail. This is totally different from the past sitcom i saw when i was young. The story is simply amazing, a mix between dark comedy and horror (horrormedy... hihi...)
I'll wait the next part. I barely remembered the older series of Sabrina the teenage witch. Thanks to this one, one remembered a lot, although there is not much connection between both of them. Names and places, but that's it. It also remembered me of Harry Potter. I mean, a "half blood" witch who encounters the dark lord, who is master of a dark cult? A school of magic? Forbidden books she uses to do forbidden things? A destiny she might have to fulfill? Anyways, I prefer Sabrina. Somehow innocent, cute, intelligent... surely due to the actress, who's gonna have a bright future. First I thought it was the story of a normal girl who got witch powers, but I learned I was wrong. Sabrina has always been a witch, with a witching family. Although she finds her love between the mortals.
What did surprise me is the easy way she does all the forbidden stuff. Someone died, so we resurrect that person, although is the most dark thing possible. She meets the dead without fearing to die and wields hell's flames as she would have done it all her life... it all happens too easy. Well, she's got help. Okay. That "hell" is what i dont like. Why so easily? Free will? Where? The end is the most horrible. She was just a playball for the devil... and may be even more used... All the fight for free will, for her friends and loved ones, was for nothing? I hope not.<br/><br/>I'm burning as in hell, awaiting a second season..... which may be less easy, less destiny, but more Sabrina and more free will. Well act, well script, well done! Looking forward to the 2nd season I just finished the first season and I got this feeling of wanting more of the same. So, I decided to read some reviews... And, yes, this 'remake' may be nothing like de 90's show, It may contain (a little bit too much) political stuff in the two firsts episodes, but it is, at the end, a captive, exciting and thrilling show. The actors did an amazing job and it's hard to not get touched by the characters and to don't be eager to know what will happen to them.
So, yeah, it may have some mistakes, but, for me, it was absolutely worth watching it! Brilliant!! I was cringing when i seen there was yet to be another re release of a vintage classic. Sick of re releases ruining my favourite alltimes. And on top i heard theres no funny talking Salem in this like the old one that i loved.. but this series does its own thing and it WORKS!! K8nd of reminds me of Buffy but this is of to a better fiercer start for first series. I binged watched this in 2 days in between work. And it has enough good storys in that keep you 9n edge entertained and not predictable. Can not wait for the next series!! But can you please have Sabrina stop saying the characters' names over and over while she is speaking with them? What's that about, Sabrina? Why do you end your sentences with their names, Sabrina? We can see who it is, Sabrina.<br/><br/>I know it's a small thing, unless there's a point to it, please stop. For the most part I enjoyed the first 10 episodes, but I found the show short on consequences, until later episodes. I think I would have enjoyed the show a lot better if the witches were not a reflection of Christianity (Satinists), but did their own thing. I think the show would be a lot more interesting if there were competing moral centers of the witching community. There seemed to be an near start of a plot with familiars, but that never went any where. On the whole, fun to watch, but not great. If you want to feel the cheap and hollow feeling of nostalgia this series is not for you. The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina is a wonderful show that mixes horror (the true kind) with drama. It doesn't rely on jump scares, and uses different lenses and effects to make the creepy masks/costumes/cgi scarier. It has what horror needs to be scary, atmosphere! The characters are unique and almost everyone have actual depth (a few exceptions, but for minor characters). Characters have their own desires, needs, motivation and all the stuff scripts should have. There is alot of themes going on, and besides the obvious ones there are lots of underlaying themes which are hinted at subtly (example when Sabrina talks about The Fly being about gender dysmorphia which kinda resembles her own situation). And it has some obscure references like Haxan (a swedish silent film about witches). The only real downside are some of the creative choices in the direction. It's shot beautifully with really good cinematography for the tone they obviously want, but some of the effects (like blurring the backgrounds or sides in some of the shots) don't work they way they're intended. I can see what they were going for, but it didn't work. But besides this minor point it really is a great show with fun unique characters, and heavy themes and philosophy that is questioned and looked closer at. Lastly there is some really fun and creative work done with the fact that witches worship the devil and satanism being their religion. This is not just something they introduce and just forget about, they really delve deep down into this subject, and the result is interesting. Check it out! Well not the sort of thing I normally watch, but was quite interesting and Michelle Gomez outdoes herself almost stealing the limelight from the main actress. Im secretly looking forward to the next series and I hope its as well acted, lighted and staged as the first. Excellent series that has lots more story to tell. Let us start with the bad
The show is not without is flaws, most noticeable ones are
1. Dropped plotlines and set ups that go nowhere. You will often be engrossed in the moment only to find the story incoherent or poorly set up/delivered, after you stop to think about it for a second. This show is a visual experience first and everything else second. JJ abrams mystery box is in full swing and all the crumb dumping seems to have eaten up screen time so they had to rush the last 2 episodes, even then they still went for sequel hooks and crumbs for season 2. While I did enjoy season 1 (mostly) I feel no burning need to see season 2.
2. The pacing and structure, more specifically I would say that its structured somewhat like a conventional tv show, each episode ends with a twist or a hook for the next episode and each "A plot" is contained within the episode so you end up with episode where the story drags on to fill the runtime and episode where major events/emotional climax happen off screen.
3. Just there syndrome. many story elements and even some of the characters end up being just there, contributing to nothing and just snatching away screen time from time to time. Salem is one such character, no time is given to his relationship with Sabrina, He is like a new phone she got and got bored with quickly. Generally at some points it feels like you are watching stylized and more expensive version of Ravenswood mixed with The Little Vampire<br/><br/>the mixed
1.Character behavior/emotional response. The show goes for absurdist path where everyone acts like they are in a comic book and not like "real" people. I don't mind this as long as the show does not ask me to be moved. In same cases there seems to be no rhyme or reason for why certain characters do certain things, some of it can be excused with preexisting history that the viewer is not aware but most of the time that is not the case.<br/><br/>2.The politics. Given the absurdist bend this show often takes, its really hard to tell when and if ever they are serious about any of their politics. I feel like this was intentional and is challenging to the viewer in multiple ways, since the ideas often come from antagonists or are there to show someone is being naive. It drops some words, book titles and mostly leaves it up to you to decide how you take the whole thing.<br/><br/>
and now for the good.
1. Acting. While the scripts don't call for much range I must say that actors for Zelda, Hilda ,Sabrina ,Father Blackwell,Ms.Wardwell and Prudence were a perfect fit for this incarnation of the show.
2. The humor. The show has a wonderful sense of humor and it's wonderful mostly because it does not expect you to laugh, it delivers the humor and moves on, leaving it up to you to decide if you found it funny or even if you noticed it at all. Not in your face like scream queens (That show is enjoyable in its own way).
3.Cinematography. There are often shows were you can just listen to without missing anything, this is not one of those shows. The visuals and camera movement are beautifully. Some choices maybe an acquired taste but they add to the overall experience A strong-willed teenage girl, half witch and half mortal, must choose between the world of magic and the ordinary in Chilling Adventures of Sabrina (2018 - ), the latest adaptation of the Archie Comics series Sabrina the Teenage Witch. Written and developed by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, the series embraces a much darker tone than previous incarnations. Its incredible style, intense visual effects and action, and talented cast keep its social justice subtext from becoming too annoying.<br/><br/>As Halloween and her sixteenth birthday approaches, Sabrina Spellman (Kiernan Shipka) is torn between loyalty to her high school friends, Rosalind "Roz" Walker (Jaz Sinclair) and Susie Putnam (Lachlan Watson), and her boyfriend Harvey Kinkle (Ross Lynch), and loyalty to her family and the Church of Night. Sabrina's aunts, Hilda (Lucy Davis) and Zelda (Miranda Otto), raised her after her parent's died in a plane crash, and desperately want her to continue the family tradition, undergo the Dark Baptism, and sign her name in the Devil's book.<br/><br/>Sabrina's misgivings grow as she battles her patriarchal high school principal, Mr. Hawthorne, and a trio of witches called the Weird Sisters, who believe a half-breed like Sabrina shouldn't be allowed to attend the Academy of the Unseen Arts. Father Faustus Blackwood (Richard Coyle), High Priest of the Church of Night and Dean of the Academy of the Unseen Arts, assures Sabrina their religion is about free will, but it seems the Dark Lord has other plans.<br/><br/>Chilling Adventures of Sabrina was filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, which seems like a fitting choice. It's almost always raining and dreary. The cinematography is great, with a chilling play of light and color, especially in interior scenes. My only gripe is that it's often filmed with a very shallow depth of field, making it look like someone smeared grease around the lens.<br/><br/>Of course, no show is complete these days without some kind of "woke" politics. Sabrina and her friends form a group cleverly titled WICCA (get it?): Women's Intersectional Culture and Creative Association, after she casts a spell on Principal Hawthorne, terrorizing him with spiders and making him absent from work so the assistant principal can approve the club. They do this to protect a transgender friend from jock bullies.<br/><br/>After enlisting the Weird Sisters' help to punish the jocks, their leader tells Sabrina the Dark Lord wants them to have freedom or power, but not both. "Why?" Sabrina asks. "Well, he is a man after all," she replies. Oh brother. Can my eyes roll any harder? These nods to the SJW crowd are about as subtle as Michelle Wolf at the White House Correspondents Dinner.<br/><br/>That Sabrina has a loving and devoted boyfriend seems like a quaint throwback, a relic of earlier Sabrina incarnations. The show itself is a weird amalgamation of ideas and time periods. Sabrina the comic book is set during the 1960s, and the Netflix series features card catalogs, transistor radios, and rotary phones, but its music and pop culture references are decidedly more contemporary. Witchcraft in the series is also part traditional lore and part revisionist Wicca. It certainly is unique and surprising.<br/><br/>Chilling Adventures of Sabrina was originally supposed to air on the CW, but went straight to Netflix instead, where it has won many accolades. It currently has a critic rating of 88 percent and audience approval rating of 82 percent on RottenTomatoes. The show's film-quality effects and cinematography set it far apart from its competitors, and it makes Sabrina The Teenage Witch (1996-2003) look like it was filmed in someone's garage. If Chilling Adventures of Sabrina is any indication, the future of supernatural television is dark indeed. Yes it has political messages (btw welcome to the 21st century of Hollywood) it goes overboard on the satanism and for some reason there is not a lamp on set. Very dark literally and figuratively (i dont get the problem with viewers being able to see what's happening). Otherwise it is deceptively intriguing Diametrically opposed to our 90s Sabrina I didn't find horror in this TV show, but i found great storytelling. So smooth, nice acting, and one great drama not to miss out. I would say its more of an adventure drama genre TV show far away from horror. Can't wait to see whats going to happen in season 2. Totally recommended A great show to binge watch but, if you're looking for an ounce of depth you won't find it here. The show starts out eerie and exciting but the ending doesn't last that long. Kiernan shipka is a highlight as she gives her best performance as sabrina. I love this show.... Very good story line....some adventurous....I think.... you all like it I was very impressed with this remake. The TV series was a cheesy, comedy of what witches living among mortals are suppose to be, this was much more realistic. The witches are dark, like they are supposed to be! I dislike the trend of making evil creatures to be good. Don't get me started on the new remake of Charmed, which I haven't even been able to finish the pilot episode because of how bad it is. This remake is extremely addicting, some of the sabrina/harvey scenes I could do without but I'm not very romantic. Great cast, entertaining story lines, and I can't wait for Season 2! There are so many things that make this show amazing I can't believe all the bad reviews. The show moves at a good pace with no real filler to slow it down. All the acting is very good. Each role is perfectly cast. All the lore is fascinating and blends perfectly with the tone and the setting of the show. It does get political but every tv show does this. It's a flaw but it a flaw that runs across all tv shows. To be fare, everything in entertainment gets political. I don't think it's fare to hate on this show when it gets political when every show does the same thing. One of the things that makes me love this show is how unpredictable it is. Almost every other tv show is so predictable it's not even fun to watch. This quality should always be admired and praised due to the fact it's so rare.<br/><br/>I just watched this show because I was bored. By the end of the first episode I was hooked. If you don't at least give this show a chance you're making a mistake. Very entertaining show, a lot of confusing though but I think I figure something out. What if Connor was Sabrina's brother and the high priest stole him and gave him to a human family so he could kill Sabrina's dad and take over? If you remember in episode 1 Sabrina dreams of two babies, then later her mother says they took her baby from her... I may be wrong but I put spoiler alert in case it turns out to be true. What I like most about the show is that it gets the balance of horror and humor perfectly right. It is really dark, even scary and gory at times, but it still has its funny moments, mostly concerning Hilda and Zelda. The way the show smoothly incorporates both aspects is very satisfying and makes for a great bizarre and (very) dark comedy.<br/><br/>What I like least is how heavy-handed it deals with diversity. It almost seems like they are working off a check list. I am all for a diverse cast of characters, but the way they handle it just appears forced and not organic at all. As a result, the show cares little about the specific issues of the diverse characters it portrays - they are just there to check a box. I'm pleased to say that I love this new series it has the perfect amount of darkness mixed with comedy and the characters seem extremely well crafted for so early on in the show can't wait for more. The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina -- set in the same universe as the gritty-but-pretty Netflix show Riverdale -- is an artsy take on pagan witches, and is based on the comics of the same name. It features sacrifice, necromancy, cannibalism, sexuality, feminism, hazing, and, well, Satan.<br/><br/>Let me start off by saying that most -- if not all -- of the characters in this show are grey. Not grey as in dull, no. Morally grey. While that's okay, because essentially people are neither all good or bad, it did leave me with a sense of . . .'what?'<br/><br/>My personal favorites are sweet Hilda, determined Sabrina, powerful Prudence, cool Ambrose, hella-shady Miss Wardwell (spoiler alert: who isn't exactly Miss Wardwell), and the seedy, disgusting Lord Blackwood.<br/><br/>Aesthetically, the show is beautiful. From Sabrina's rich red coat, to the chilly atmosphere of the location shots. Even the school is dingy and treated with a sickly blue-beige color scheme. Dr. Cerberus, the themed coffee shop, is a triumph. If it was a location in my own town, I'd go there every day.<br/><br/>The show follows a simple episodic pattern, with teen angst, and a 'will-she-won't-she sign the book' arc throughout.<br/><br/>My main problem with this show is the special effects, and the The Dark Lord -- or TDL. Now I love me some monsters, especially special effects monsters -- ahem, Fish God from TSOW --, this show lacked both inspiration and the ability to know when less is more. In the case of Salem's goblin reveal, that was done beautifully. Inky shadows, rich red, Sabrina's palpable fear at just exactly WHAT did she invite into her room. And then everything switches when the inky shadow creature changes its form. TDL, however, not so much. The design was clunky and laughable. And he appears almost every five minutes -- I'm exaggerating, but still. Don't even get me started on The Greendale 13 and their laughable zombie-witch effects.<br/><br/>(Also, the 'Cunning'? Really? Sigh.)<br/><br/>A question that irritated me throughout the show was this: why the hell would Satan be hanging out in a mine shaft in Greendale? It just doesn't make any sense. I get that the mines 'go all the way down to Hell'. But that doesn't explain why a malevolent, powerful being would hang out in a mine. To do what, give people jump scares?<br/><br/>Aside from my personal gripes about TDL, the show isn't a bad watch. The characters really drive it forward. Despite Sabrina's outward innocence, something dark lies within. And the closing frames of the season are breathtaking.<br/><br/>Overall score: 8/10<br/><br/>Give this a try on a cold, rainy day if you like morally grey characters doing morally grey things. Cute show :) love the characters and storyline. Has a magical theme. It's not Emmy worthy but people are treating it like it's the worst... I quite liked the dark, horror without the heavy gore... Good cast. The story line isn't horrible and not amazing, but I'm not giving it low stars since I'm actually watching the while season It's not a "perfect" show (there are some cheesier than necessary scenes and dialogue), but it has a good story line, great setting, music, visuals, and makes you wonder "what's next?" There are also genuinely scary parts (suspense, plot twists), along with cozy dark haunted house style scenes.<br/><br/>While I don't like the blurry lens effect (as if the peripheral of everything not in the exact center of the camera's view is overly blurred), it's not enough of a dealbreaker to stop my interest in the show. And the acting is pretty good (with the exception of the cousin constantly calling Sabrina "cousin"...that gets a little annoying).<br/><br/>Also, don't expect it to be a true to form prequel of Sabrina the Teenage Witch...that was VERY lighthearted version of Sabrina's story lol. This show actually is more like Riverdale on CW (which is related to Sabrina in terms of the Archie Comics stories). My daughter and I started watching this like a week after it came out on Netflix. She's 14 and doesn't like thrillers or anything scary AT ALL I however love watching scary stuff like The Walking Dead and Haunting of Hill House. But we watched 1 or 2 episodes of this new Sabrina every day and we were really quite sad when we realized we finished our last episode but I just saw that it's coming out on the 14th so we're SO happy ^_^ . I really liked it and my daughter kept saying she didn't but I always could tell she did and then one day she told me "No I don't really like it I just can't seem to stop watching it's just sort of like I don't know I guess I'd say addicting". And I'm like hahaha OK well sounds like you like it :D With a lot of dark instruments that have support in Satanism, a precious thing for witches. With a teen touch from Riverdale, this series is build with a good base of dialogues, acting, and cinematography! Some borring componnents with personages that are out of context, end unexploreds. She's a walking clusterfark and really dumb. It's like watching the witch version of Netflix's Lost in Space. Having Rosa throw in her blackness in when she's clearly mixed race was cringy. I don't mind Susie being non-binary, but making Ambrose bi-sexual out of the blue, kinda ticked me off. After Sabrina found out that Rosa had, power, why she just didn't tell her about her being a witch? I like the restt of the show, but season 2 needs to lock it down right. even though Wardwell/Gomez is pure evil, she really makes the show better.<br/><br/>Update: Okay About Rosa: Maybe it was a inside joke, because S2 they keep throwing around the term Top Boy Undeniably entertaining, this
adaptation stems from a great premise and contains a few intriguing twists along the way. However, the show does cater to a younger audience and that fact is reinstated numerous times throughout the season. It's well thought and the director certainly worked on his view of the original story, it's not sloppy, lazy, or lacking substance. There's magic, witches, dark forces, unexplained phenomena....and everything else carefully arranged to form a successful supernatural show. On the other hand, it wouldn't be fair to omit the unpleasant and lukewarm parts of it though: chilling adventures of Sabrina is also a show heavily burdened by unnecessary instances of pseudo-feminism and the illusion of encompassing inclusivity. Not to mention its slightly bizarre obsession with full blown satanic practices. I'm not a religious viewer, but after a while, the characters' every excessively repetitive "praise satan!" was a bit much for me too. Bear in mind that Chance Perdomo and Miranda Otto are carrying a good portion of this entire season, and making up for the rest of the less convincing part of the cast. It's a fun adaptation and revival of a lovely comic and cult 90's tv show classic, starring the iconic Melissa Joan Hart, who, in my opinion, portrayed her character wonderfully, with just right amounts of witty and meaningful, as opposed to Shipka, who, even though praised by many, probably younger viewers, unfortunately, failed to deliver her character Sabrina's full potential; hence the slight and subtle lack of substantial on screen - credibility. To add, for some reason, someone thought it was a good idea to use "Brina" as a constant annoyance and makeshift nickname Sabrina's friends use when referring to her. Well, it wasn't. In fact it was terrible, cringey, unnecessary and may not seem like much, but after a while, it's positively repulsing. And lastly, Salem is a fantastic addition. It is overall an amazing show and one of the better one's I've seen of late. I must point out the awesome atmosphere and consistent characters with solid arcs. They set up a lot of hints and cliffhangers so I honestly can't wait for the next season and where it takes us. The only thing that bothered me was that everything was made too easy for Sabrina. She got away with so many things and hadn't truly felt any consequences throughout the series. There are a lot of very negative reviews and I can understand where some of them are coming from, as I do agree this show does have a lot of flaws and mediocre writing, but all in all, I still very much enjoyed this show. I binged it in one evening, and personally, I think enjoying a show despite its extensive flaws just goes to show how good it is. First off, I really don't understand why people hate Sabrina's character or her actress. I find Sabrina to be a great character. She's super extra and idk that's just how a lot of teens are. One of the biggest hits about this show for me was the entire aesthetic. I love that it looks very vintage in both fashion and decor (Sabrina's house is beautiful with the dark colours and heavy furniture), yet still set in modern times. The soundtrack is also very clever by mixing throwbacks with modern alternative. Another great thing for me were Sabrina's aunts, Hilda and Zelda. I especially love Hilda. I really found that they portrayed accurately what sisters are like woth each other, but much more extreme (as all the witches seem to be extreme). I also really liked some of the character development like Prudence, who I started off hating but grew to be one of my favourite characters by the end of the show. However, some characterization was wayyyy off and I feel like that's mostly with Sabrina's friends. Harvey and Sabrina's relationship feels super awkward to watch; they don't act like teens. I liked Suzie at first as I thought she/they was/were adorable but as the show progressed, the more I found her creepy. I love the inclusion of a trans/nb character but the whole thing with her great aunt was just creepy imo. As for her other friend (cant remember her name rn), I actually did kinda like her and found she had a really cool potential with her psychic shtick or w/e. Also, I see a lot of people compare this to Buffy (which I adored until Angel left and the writing got shiftier), but I don't think the two shows are even comparable. The only things they have in common are having blonde supernatural teenage girls as leads. So overall, I would definitely recommend this show to anyone who wants to watch it. It's a great way to kill time and you won't regret it. I love that they took the storyline and put it in a whole new universe instead of trying to copy the original, wich I also loved. Great job! Cant wait to watch the next season! Okay I love this show! I wasn't sure if I could watch this, because I'm easily scared but I'm in love. The actors are great, the writing is good and the over all vibe of this show is amazing. I watched some parts with only sound, which I would recommand if you're not so brave and want to sleep at night. But over all great show! Can't wait for season 2! One point of critique; the way they filmed this show can be a little out of focus from time to time.
Have fun watching witches! Super show n i really love it.... Now its my favorite show ever..... Waiting for new season eagerly..... Tried to watch, but you really have to like watching a black screen with dialog. There is literally no lighting, which I assume is to save money. Was hoping to like but not worth the eye strain. I tried very hard to like this series but ultimately it simply doesn't work. The direction is okay and the performances are okay but perhaps it being a musical dulled my enthusiasm for it. I Can't believe, Boring
WTF, What a season. It's like Misical and Romantic movie.
Story√∞≈∏‚Äò≈Ω I avoided watching for a while because I associated the name with the pasty 90's show that was too wholesome for my taste, but I walked in on my roommate watching an episode of season 3 and it was great so I started from the beginning. It's a nice balance of edgy and wholesome, and is a pretty good representation of/metaphor for humanity and our duality. They've kept it fresh and interesting and the episodes are nice and long, making for a very cinematic experience. I'd love to see character arcs involving more of the cast in the coming seasons, especially Lucy Davis's impeccable and hilarious portrayal of Hilda Spellman.
It can be graphic and of course the subject matter may be offensive to some viewers, but only the ones who probably need to be offended. The show is engaging, exciting, fresh, and layered with innuendo and metaphor. My favorite kind. "Chilling Adventures of Sabrina" season 3 delivers another action packed season as teenage Sabrina tries to juggle being a high school student and Queen of Hell. Lot's of new characters are introduced this time around including: Caliban (the Prince Of Hell), newcomer Robin Goodfellow some pagans and a number of new witches (including Mambo Marie). I'm happy to see that Ambrose and Prudence get to play a bigger role this season. Michelle Gomez as Lillith/Madam Satan/Mary Wardwell continues to delight. And the aunties Zelda (Miranda Otto) and Hilda (Lucy Davis) round out this EXCELLENT cast. I continue to enjoy the humor of the show. When trying to explain why Lillith still looks like Ms Wardwell she says "a face like this is hard to beat". I also enjoyed the crossovers with Riverdale. One of the Southside Serpents visits the bookstore and is promptly eaten by Spider Hilda. Too funny! After my wife and I binged 2 seasons in 3 evenings we are very pleased. The series has a good storyline. There is so much going on in almost every episode that missing an episode will leave you guessing. That to me is the only downside because your energy drained fast after 4 or 5 episodes in a row.
The other day I said to my wife "what experiences have they got during recording" because all the satanic crosses, the hail Satan and much more should bring a reaction to say the least. But that is for another time.
so far we enjoined Sabrina a lot and I hope season 3 will keep this energetic flow. It's dark and very satanic and not the most pleasant series around. Most actors are sympathetic and even cute andtyr their best to play their roles but it's not a series made for kids. Some episodes feel like a drag Totally brain less teen show no story, less magic,no nudes... only trying to show some hot scene... unworthy for your brain...be safe..
DON'T DRINK AND DRIVE
DON'T WATCH SABRINA Stop it. Just stop this downward spiral into an irredeemable disaster.
Why are show producers so out of touch with their audience?
Plenty of shows have low ratings and high criticism for being pc woke messes but they astoundingly keep churning them out regardless. Now we have this once wonderfully dark adaptation of a show being violated by shoehorning in bippity-boppity musical sh*ite when it pleases. Enough already!!!! CAOS is a very addictive netflix show. I'm a fan of the original 1990's Sabrina the teenage witch so i was bound to love this version. Nothing in life is perfect, including this show.<br/><br/>But that being said, it hits all the right beats.<br/><br/>Visually stunning, I adore the setting, the small details, the gorgeous actors. A lot of effort went into the details. And it shows.<br/><br/>The are enough enjoyable characters and great acting to pull though those lacking in talent, which honestly, I can't really think of many that annoy me to any real degree.<br/><br/>The storyline is gripping and entertaining.<br/><br/>If you like gore, the occult, beautiful people dressed beautifully, then just watch it and have fun.<br/><br/>Reminds me a lot of the Buffy series. Super fun. This series really shines at making you interested in the characters and making you care about them. There are so many endearing characters that I found myself liking and honestly wishing I could know more about, from Sabrina herself to the demon lords of Hell. This is definitely a fun series, one I easily became a fan of. I was prepared to be quite upset when I learned that the main bad guys this season were Pagans and worse, that they were serving an Evil God known as the Greenman. You see, I AM a Pagan and I own and operate a shop called The Green Man in honor of the Deity. So I went into this season with a LOT of concerns and baggage. And, as expected, the caricatures that the show presented in NO way actually represented Pagans Or the Greenman. They were damn entertaining though. I enjoyed them thoroughly and Especially the Wicker Man reference. The points I am shaving off the review come not from the subject matter of his it was handled, But from the Excessive and badly handled musical numbers. All those who have invested in Sabrina and co.'s adventures for the last two years, will finally get an answer as in whether or not our beloved gang will succeed in rescuing Nick out of the depths of Hell. Part 2 was ten times darker than when we first started hanging out with the Spellman-family, and you better get ready for an even darker ride of biblical proportions, and hope everyone survives this part in Sabrina's story.<br/><br/>Part Three of Chilling Adventures of Sabrina kicks off exactly where we left. Sabrina (Kiernan Shipka) has defeated her father Lucifer (Luke Cook), yet the Dark Lord remains trapped within the human prison of her beloved boyfriend, Nicholas (Gavin Leatherwood). 'Brina and her loyal mortal friends Harvey (Ross Lynch), Ros (Jaz Sinclair) and Theo (Lachlan Watson) - aka "The Fright Club" - embark on an emotional mission to free Sabrina's love from eternal damnation, before he burns in Hell under Madam Satan's (Michelle Gomez) watchful eye. However, the Dark Lord's unseating has sent shockwaves through the realms - and, with no one on the throne, Sabrina must assume the title of "Queen" to defend it against a challenger, the handsome Prince of Hell, Caliban (Sam Corlett). Meanwhile, in Greendale, a mysterious carnival rolls into town, bringing with it a threat to the Spellmans and the coven: a tribe of pagans looking to resurrect an ancient evil...<br/><br/>If you thought Sabrina's journey in the last season was dark, when she wore a crown made out of thorns and condemned a group of Christian devil hunters to the deepest pits of Hell - you better close your eyes now, because it's about to get DARK! This third season is more of the same, yet more elevated, more developed and goes deeper than you ever thought was possible. Harvey and Rosalind's relationship grows at a steady and very steamy pace, while Theo finally gets noticed by a mysterious young man, who arrives at a most unusual moment, to conquer his heart. The romance in this season is passionate. When their virginity becomes an important part in whether they'll survive the Apocalypse or not, these tender relationships get put under a lot of pressure.<br/><br/>More magic, more myths and legends and a lot more creatures inspirit every episode. Kiernan Shipka (Mad Men) is a force to be reckoned with. Her on screen presence and chemistry with literally every other character is not just powerful, but godlike. This is an actress who developed her character on screen so gracefully, without ever letting down the energy that is clearly needed to convince an audience into believing she is Sabrina. A very important part of this season revolves around Prudence Night (Tati Gabrielle - The 100), who's even more badass than in the previous two parts, yet it feels like she's just there to "slice and dice" and bring an extra layer of emotion in what's already a rollercoaster of shocks and thrills.<br/><br/>A crossover between Riverdale and Greendale - which takes place in the same universe - seems imminent and fans of the other "dale" will definitely pick up on some references and even characters that visit the town. Chilling Adventures of Sabrina does confidently stand on its own and doesn't need to cross paths with anyone from the other town. It might not have as big of a fanbase as Riverdale, but it's clearly the superior and less melodramatic show of the two. We do get a bit more of a Riverdale-vibe, with Sabrina as a cheerleader, and "The Fright Club" performing famous pop-rock numbers - such as Wheatus' "Teenage Dirtbag", in their garage. It is however, the inventiveness and originality of the series' (developed by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa - who also created Riverdale) screenplay, that really knows how to keep a steady pace and never shows signs of slowing down.<br/><br/>Part Three of Chilling Adventures of Sabrina is an addictive hell-bent thrill ride from start to finish, you'll have to make sure you don't find yourself dreaming about pagans, banshees or voodoo priestesses. What's actually an eight hour long film, will have you laughing maniacally at how demonically delicious this season turns out to be. You'd be crazy not to sell your soul to the devil - that's how wicked it is! I love the idea and tone of the reboot. There are quite complex undertones and themes right across the board, with libertine lifestyles and how far free will should be exercised in two conflicting co existing societies. However. It is let down in my opinion by the performances of Harvey and Sabrina. Their dynamic is constantly flat, and individually they are not the greatest either. In addition, the second series wrapped up in a flawed set of dry set pieces which felt rushed and lacked any more of the serious undertones the first series and early second series showed. After the first series I could not wait for the second. Now I've lost interest. There are many better programs out there with investing in, BUT still probably worth watching for some excellent performances from the secondary characters... Especially the other three Spelllmans. 5/10 for me means it's not bad. Worth watching, with some stand out moments /performances. Everybody was weird out for the new adaptation of "Sabrina the Teenage Witch" because the tone was darker and dramatic than the previous show with the identical character that was pretty much goofy. But this new show stands alone because it is so much different than the other show and it's based on a different comic book.<br/><br/>This modern version of Sabrina is Dark. The witchcraft is totally related to Satanism. The devil is also a character on the show, and it's hot but I don't go to spoil something else about that.<br/><br/>The first part of the show is reasonably decent. The world of Sabrina is divided in two: The human and the witch world. When the show focuses on the witch world, is when it shines. The witchcraft in "Chilling adventures of Sabrina" is awesome. The plot is entertaining and full of magical and dark twists. Meanwhile, the world of humans is kind of boring with the clich√© problems that this kind of show will have and lots of commentary about sexism because you know, feminism. It practically feels like the mortal world is just there to have a problematic in Sabrina's world.<br/><br/>The second part is so much better, most of it. The beginning set us a different problematic for Sabrina, and the wicked plan of the villains of the show is revealed so we have some sense of direction. The mortal world gets more interesting at the point that they become useful for the end of the season. Sabrina gets more interesting as the leading character and their origins are surprising.<br/><br/>You should definitely give this show a shot. It's a pretty good show for teens about witchcraft. Sounds like a long and odd title, but that is the best way to describe how this show worked for me. I was so expecting and anticipating a reboot that stuck pretty close to home. Light hearted, more so towards that of comedy. But then what was delivered was dark, satanic, and full of demonic witchcraft.
At first I wasn't really on board. I was still clinging to the sinking lifeblood that was a sitcom. But then after watching a few episodes I got the feeling I was watching more of a TVMA Buffy The Vampire Slayer revival... and that's when it worked for me.
More then likely you were not 100% sold on this show from posters and teasers, heck, maybe even from a full episode. This is definitely the one that you have to try out and invest some time into. But once I, not the show, got into stride, I am now GREATLY enjoying it! I loved the original Sabrina the teenage witch with Melissa Joan heart and the original cast and most cast were better in appearance than this version and it was more lighthearted with humor and some name dropping here and there. On to this version it seemed like at every turn there were praising the dark lord and almost like it was mocking the Catholic Church and further making people who do practice witchcraft or similar religions look even more evil so if you want to keep the innocent and lighthearted opinion of Sabrina the teenage witch than you should not watch this or if your are religious I started this and still felt unsure about whether or not I liked it up until half way through season 1, but I found myself wanting to keep watching it. It's a bit cheesy, of course, but it's a show about a 16 year old witch in high school so how could that not have some cheese? It's a melodrama of a subject, and if you just relax and go with the flow it's quite enjoyable. Okay so firstly I'm not a fan of the first Sabrina, so I'm judging this for what it is. I'm a big fan of Buffy and love this genre, but it's not been done well in recent years ( with exception to The Originals). I'm not saying this is amazing, but it definitely has potential. It took me some time to get into the characters because of the over the top acting, but for some reason it works. Just like Buffy did, they were cheesy and awkard at first and the script was a bit MEH, but they warmed to their characters so much so that that they made those characters their own and we believed in them. I think that's what this show is starting to do. The acting isn't bad, the story lines are compelling and the characters are likable. I'm not sure what people are expecting, but it's definitely worth a watch. The story is really cool, Miranda Otto (if the name doesn't ring a bell, maybe the "I am no man!!!" line from lord of the rings does) is flawless as aunt Zelda, amazing actress, and so is Michelle Gomez portraying Mary Wardwell/Lilith. The only problem I have with the show is with the actress that portrays Sabrina, Kiernan Shipka. I really don't know why they picked her, she is overly dramatic, makes you feel like she is a spoiled brat, all her same age peers act waaaay better than she does, mostly everyone acts better than she does. Don't get me wrong, she is pretty and I like her face but acting like a bad girl really does not suit her in the second season and it makes you cringe at times and forget about the good writing and amazing actresses I mentioned above (forgot to mention that I really like Lucy Davis as Aunt Hilda, she is such a sweet British aunt, and Chance Perdomo as Ambrose with aunt Zelda they make up an amazing witching family, also not to forget Prudence, Nick, Roz and Theo who are just lovable). I think you should really give this show a shot, it's a cool story if you are into fantasy, witches and such (I have seen mostly all the movies with magic and witches that are out there, fantasy is my cocaine, and this show is surprisingly soothing and cute). Also I have seen a comment about it being tediously politically correct and I think you would have this feeling if you were a man that doesn't get gender equality or the fact that bringing it up more and more often makes people understand they cannot continue ignoring it and having business as usual. Business as usual is over, and yes we will be in your face. In Season 2, the Chilling Adventures gets darker and more focused on the storyline. The writers were not afraid to draw on numerous biblical parallels and references without fear of backlash by more orthodox viewers. The Christ-like story of Sabrina was both chilling and funny, making this Season a joy to watch. Are these reviews for the same show that I and all my friends, teenage daughter included, love? I don't get it! The show is amazing! First 2 or 3 episodes in s1 were sort of a drag, but when everything fell in place it got really interesting. It's dark like really dark, suspenseful, gory and entertaining. S2 is even more interesting than s1, where Sabrina finally got to know who the F she was, I was filled with joy at the amount of power she could wield. This is not your regular horror series. It is dark and filled with occultism but in a way that everyone can watch it without getting nightmares. I love it! 9/10 I totally recommend! Set in the town neighborhing Riverdale, the adventures of the Archieverse continues with the adventures of Sabrina Spellman a young teen who discovers her family heritage as a young witch, but one of a special destiny of great interest to sinister forces attempting to manipulate her and her talent for the otherworldy power mongering. She attempts to enjoy as much as a teen relationship she can have admis the backdrop of this situation. Seems to follow the same senario of modern witch discovers powers and tries to maintain a life while ruinating sinister plans. I am happy with the casting for this series, i feel like the cast are the foundation of this show and really sell it Sobre a segunda temporada...Empoderamento feminino puro. Da mocinha √† vil√£. ***SOME SPOILERS***<br/><br/>I loved the old TV sitcom, so I wanted to check this out. Now, this was with full knowledge that this is NOT a remake of the orginal TV show, but an adaptation of the darker comics, which I haven't ever read. I expected it to be dark, and did a little research to find out what to expect, and was put off by the idea of witches following Lucifer. Like, what is this, the 1600s?
But I still gave it a shot and ended up bringing the entire season, and looking forward to the 2nd (which I also binge watched).
The Satanism is something of an inverted picture of Catholicism, complete with their own version of the Pope. The sexism is strong, and I was ready to dislike wholeheartedly. And along comes this sweet girl, of dual parentage, trying to learn about her "other side", having grown up mostly with mortals. She tries her best to reconcile both sides and even tries to bring them closer together, in peace, while simultaneously combatting some very heavy handed sexism at the same time.
Now, obviously, shows tend to exaggerate stereotypes, and sometimes that's a good thing. It reminds us both how far we've come, and how far we have left to go.
Overall, I found the story and characters compelling, especially Sabrina's best friends, an African American girl whose family was cursed with blindness by witches back in the 1600s and a nonbinary young person struggling with her/his gender identity. There is an Adams Family Charm. The stories are definitely weird.<br/><br/>I'd say the best part is Sabrina. She's cute, serious, entertaining. Definitely carries the series. I love this series and I'm happy they put in twists and changed the original story line up. At first I was hesitant because it's significantly darker than what I usually watch but I ended up really getting into it. There's a lot of call for women to stand up and to take power. The church is very misogynistic and Greendale is stuck in the 60's. People may think that the misogyny shown is in the past but I can promise it's very relevant in modern day churches. There's a lot of subtle humor, which I love and Ambrose's eyes are hysterical. As others said, there is a feminist, free will agenda which some people may hate but it's awesome to see a strong, young woman who isn't afraid to stand up to powerful men. This is a spoiler and a critique all in one. To begin, this is a good show 7/10. It is a little darker than shows I like to watch, but still watchable - not gross or sleazy. I did find humor in the lengths they would go to say exactly the opposite of what a Christian would say. Oh, thank Hell.<br/><br/>I am going straight to the end of season two for my review and where things changed for me. To me the logic was lost. While they had words for many anti-Christian terms, antipope was lame, because antipope is a Christian term. To even claim they were the first religion then use antipope weakens their entire religion. They could have used a different term.<br/><br/>Next we have Witch Hunters. Not knowing what to call them, they named them Angels. Honestly, we have a 1000 names for evil people, Devil, Demonic, Satanic, Evil, Pure Evil, Witch, Warlock and so on, but the only name you can come up was Angel. They behaved more like anti-witches than angels. They cast spells and barely held their own against unprepared preteen witches, but were easily decimated by hellfire.<br/><br/>That brings me up to Sabrina, the teenage Witch. We knew from the beginning that her mother was mortal, but now we know that her father was the devil, she is a Nephilim. That sort of invalidates the entire series, because she had no witchy powers to come into at age 16. There two rules about how to become a werewolf. Either you are scratched or it is hereditary but not both. Same thing applies to witch folklore. Either you can learn to become one or it is hereditary. The coming out at 16 implies heredity. So, not a witch whatsoever. To invoke her demonic powers, she literally had to die. When she creates a golem and gave away her non-existent witch powers, she is still had her blood born demonic powers which cannot be bestowed by a spell. And finally, the demonic crown. She willingly gives up her demonic crown to Lilith, the first witch. Lilith then grants Sabrina the return of her powers. Wait...Sabrina, the half-demon, is more powerful than Lilith. How can a witch bestow powers? Let's just attribute that to Lilith undid Sabrina's spell. An enjoyable watch. Entertaining and fun with a little element of horror and some bits I'd never have associated with 'the teenage witch'!. Enjoyed every minute. Not ground breaking, but worth watching in my opinion It turn out be a pretty good show. The show has mix of Harry Potter and American Horror Story together. Kieran Shipka (Sally in Mad Men) is okay as Sabrina. Her Sabrina is more spunky than Melissa Joan Hart and the animated character. Some of the cast members are British. Miranda Otto as Aunt Zelda is channing Bette Davis, her version of Zelda's mean while Aunt Hilda is nice and mother figure to their niece. Salem is there too but doesn't speak (which is disappointing, but they say he be speaking in future seasons) and Sabrina's cousin, Ambrose kind of remind me of Salem himself. Michelle Gomez (Missy (the female master) in Doctor Who) play Sabrina's favorite teacher/nemesis who's using her and helping her at the same time because she had her own agenda. The biggest question will be: Will they ever be cross-over episode in Riverdale with Sabrina come the town? To tell you the truth Sabrina is way better than the now trash Riverdale. Chilling Adventures of Sabrina is a Netflix series of Horror / Supernatural genre.
He is originally from the United States, and speaks English.
This series has a total of 20 episodes shot in two parts (11 for part 1 , 9 for part 2).<br/><br/>---- * ---- * ----<br/><br/>Chilling Adventures of Sabrina imagine the origin of Sabrina the witch's apprentice adventures as a dark story focused on the transition to adulthood through horror, the occult sciences and of curse witchcraft.<br/><br/>Sabrina struggles to reconcile her dual nature (half witch, half moral) wile opposing the forces of evil that threaten her family and the world of morals. Season 1 of CAOS was good but not as good as I expected. So, I didn't have much expectations for Part 2. But Part 2 was much better than Season 1 in many aspects. Part 2 starts slowly and the first 4 episodes are boring and pretty much like Season 1. But the remaining episodes picks up pace and were so thrilling and had some twists. All the actor's performance was better than Season 1. Kiernan Shipka was just okay in Season 1 but here she did well. We can see how good she is in the episode which she plays a double role. The music was also better than Season 1 and it had a major role in maintaining the thrilling scenes. The cinematography is much the same. I wish the ending was better as it is just okay. Part 2 made me waiting for Part 3. This is a supernatural series which we can watch and enjoy. Despite the angled view on men as little more than blindly worship women or acting as villans
(with the sole exception beeing Ambrose).
The show still provides lots of excitements, twists, humor, magic and how people searching f√∂r their place in the world.<br/><br/>Some of the actors are simply amazing in their roles and the writing, despite beeing a bit corny and cringy from time to time still holds up really well. I read a lot of the reviews after reaching the second episode of this show, because I couldn't decide if I liked it or not. The comments here made really good points and I agreed with a lot of them. Wicca, paganism, witches...isn't about satan, hell and all those things. This show must have been written by either people who knew nothing about the subject, or they wanted to go total opposite of christianity (then they should have done a show about satanism I guess). Dunno. Anyways, all those satanic things are rather displeasing (for a show about witches at least).
I also agree about the badly placed political issues - why are they even in this show? It has nothing to do here, in my opinion...
And yes, Sabrina is a TERRIBLE little brat who is self righteous and totally selfish.
Nonetheless, I think the show isn't as bad as what people say. It is visually pleasing (dark and spooky), if you can get passed the blurriness; the story is rather interesting, the acting is good.
To summarize: I like the dark side of the show, but I dislike the inappropriate views of witches. Great series, worth wathing. horrible ending to season one. defeated the whole purpose she was fighting for in the first place. hope it gets better in season 2. This is good and interesting. The lead draws you in with her story. Her family is likable. Not believable but interesting. A new take on this whole topic. All prior witch movies are reruns. This is a breath of fresh air The first thing you need to know is: If you're going to compare it to the 90s sitcom, then don't watch it. You cannot go into this expecting it to be a 90s sitcom. Pretend it's an entirely different show-because it IS. That's why it has a new title. I never watched Sabrina as a kid, so I have an advantage coming into this, I think.<br/><br/>Okay, the other first thing is that the aesthetic of this show is Top Notch. Just really nails it down. You one of those people who wants it to be Halloween all year round, who likes things Spooky but not Scary? CAOS has got your back. It's definitely not cute and cuddly Halloween, and it's not Buffy-cheesy (or Buffy costuming... I will never forgive Buffy's werewolves); it does have a bit of an edge to it, and a significant amount of darkness. But it's not straight horror, it's just spooky enough to be suspenseful... and so, so gloriously atmospheric. Even the Christmas episode managed to be so perfectly in line with the show's ambience that I didn't feel the Christmas theme was being shoved down my throat. They melded Christmas/Solstice/Yule without even making a big deal of it. Beautiful.<br/><br/>And the other OTHER first thing is that SUSIE IS NON-BINARY SUSIE'S ACTOR IS NON-BINARY and I, a non-binary, am /ecstatic/. I was concerned about the trans character portrayal for a bit before I went to look it up and found all sorts of information about Lachlan Watson talking on their NB journey and how they've used it to influence Susie's and I'm so happy, so so so happy.<br/><br/>So, yeah, there are other things to be addressed. Is Sabrina annoyingly moralistic and preachy? Does she expect everything to go right for her because she's such a goody two-shoes? Well, yeah. That's true. It annoyed me at first, but I loved the characters around her (and the aesthe - I mean atmosphere) enough to stick with the show, and before I knew it, I was practically bingeing... and I do not binge often. Because, you see, the show pushes /back/. The writing isn't perfect, no, but it is developing; it is trying to say, Yes, Sabrina, cannibalism is bad, but you can't just charge into situations expecting them to shape around you just because you're the protagonist. She /does/ cause inconvenience for others, and they do call her on it.<br/><br/>And not only that, the writers are, I think, trying to make a good point or two using the over-the-top portrayal of Satan-worship - particularly regarding the roles of traditions in religion and life. When is it time to abandon tradition? When is it important to stand for what you believe in? What makes one person's beliefs more valid than the next? The show isn't trying to put Satan-worship on a pedestal above Christianity, but rather to say there are different systems of belief-and there are good and bad people everywhere, but what's more, there are plenty of people who are good /and/ bad. Look at Zelda's character growth from beginning to end of the first season. Look at Nick's compassion for his rival. Look at Prudence's self-centeredness, yet simultaneous willingness to team up with Sabrina - whom she hates - in order to protect a mortal trans kid at no benefit to herself (maybe some amusement but overall nothing tangible). All of these people believe in and praise Satan, and canonically cannot love as deeply as mortals, and yet they overcome this to protect others. Sabrina does inspire them to do so a lot of the time, sure, and maybe she's not as charismatic as she's supposed to be, but she is determined to /protect/, and in a world filled with so much danger and fear and cruelty, that's a character trait worth remarking upon!<br/><br/>Yes, we need more Salem, no arguments there. I personally think Ms. Wardwell is a little overwrought, though I know many like her. Ambrose is precious and I will fight anyone who says otherwise. Susie! Is! Non-binary! In mainstream! Media!<br/><br/>/The aesthetic is so perfect did you see their HOUSE/<br/><br/>Okay, Harvey is really obnoxiously dull, it's true. But we can forgive him since at least he supports Sabrina wholeheartedly (excepting *spoilers*) and is clearly so in awe of his luck.<br/><br/>Yeah, this show makes itself a platform - but in some ways, artists have to use the platforms they have or change isn't going to happen. The important thing is that the Chilling Adventures of Sabrina isn't /about/ the politics. It's about the aesth - uh, it's about the characters, and it's about protecting people who need protecting, whether that's your crotchety old aunt or a dead child you've never met or the future students of a magical school. I do hope the future seasons push a little harder, and also highlight the magic more, but as long as there's a black cat and an elaborate funeral home and a sarcastic bi cousin you can probably still count me in. This show, whilst technically being a remake is not even close to the original. I have to say I love the originalality of it. Some say they don't know what crowd they're trying to reach and I don't think they are trying to get to a specific crowd. Instead they want to do their own thing and make a fun horror comedy drama. If I had to compare it to anything I would say it's a more serious, better funded Ash vs the evil dead. I love the gore, I love aunt Hilda, and i love the show. Also, the antagonists like high priest don't seem like you're regular antagonist where their decisions are predictable just because they are "bad." They fall prey to their human emotions too which causes them to do things that would seem protagonist(y) or just real. Good show gimme more please. Became my Favorite. I'm inpatient give us more episodes . You've seen the original series and probably loved it, or your new to this.
It's not the old show but it is very good, if you can stick by the first couple of episodes it's a bit PC with those kind of issues that make you question whether you want to bother watching any more.
Well it's worth it, I really enjoyed this season and can't wait for the next.
I find the acting a bit weird and the filmography questionable at times but I can forgive that as it's an adaptation of the comics and I think while not perfect, it's still an enjoyable watch. Why i am watich this Series. But also you just keep going to watch it. Hate and love. I am in the middle of it. Ya, i agree with most of the reviews that first 4 episodes is great than 5. But, be patient to watch the 5&6 episodes and after those two you will definitely enjoy the great ending.
I don't know why writers made two or three episodes boring.
I give this 8.5/10 It took me a while to get into it but once it gets going, it's SO GOOD. It's just the right amount of spooky and sexy. Love it. Amazing reboot of Sabrina! Sexy, scary and sadistic! The best 3 S's! I loved the original TV show but this is actually a great "revamp". This is a remarkably good show. The episodes kept me on the edge and I binge watched the entire season in 3 days.
Casting is great with some top-notch performances from the two aunts and the woman who plays Devil. I did not expect much, going into this one. I was more than surprised with the quality of the show. You get a sense of similarities between this show and the Riverdale one. I do not like Riverdale at all, the bad guys come across like a bad musical theater act. Archie is so cringe! at being a bad guy, it almost hurts to watch that show. My expectations were very low with this one, because I knew that some of the same people were involved with the penning of Sabrina.<br/><br/>It works for Sabrina, in a quirky and dark sort of way, it really works for this show. I didn't enjoy the original Sabrina, because it was aimed at a young teenage audience.<br/><br/>Most often, I'd prefer the language to be appropriate for the TV-MA rating. The language here is clean however, not vulgar in the slightest. That would usually count against a show (in my book) but somehow it works here. It has some very good story telling. The acting is also good. And the series has some good intrigue.<br/><br/>As with most series, however, we can be a bit too quick in judging them. How they proceed with the next season will tell us a whole lot more. What needs to happen next - Would be for big characters to get killed off. Every good series needs that, without it, it all becomes too predictable for the mature audience. So ratings could change at a later date. But for now - Pleasantly surprised! So in general i love the series.But i didn't like the blurry motions as much.And the thing that rly bothers me was that everything is looking so vintage ... like the tv , phones , even the family photos are black and white and suddenly Harvey owns brand new Iphone ... like that mess with my head and every time his phone rings i get kicked out of the story and year line if that makes any sense.but i hope for a second season tbh <3 Love the remake a different take on the show. The darkness is what made it amazing Good solid fun, once you get through the first 2 episodes As an old geezer who enjoyed the olden Sabrina of the 90's I can't help loving this adorably evil:ish take on the old sitcom. Sure, it's stupid and terribly laughable at times - but in my opinion that's one of the shows strenghts. Everyone from writer to cast seam very much aware of how silly the premise is, which is oddly refreshing in a time of overly serious tv dramas.<br/><br/>I've read some comments from people claiming this show to be SJW-propaganda, but I disagree. Sure, women are empowered. But what's to stop them when they wield magic powers? And perhaps there's the odd political remark - but never to the point that it disagrees with me.<br/><br/>Overall a fun and easy-to-watch series. Can't wait for the next season to come. It's in general too dark filmed and it's almost impossible to recognize anything in many scenes The first episode was very heavy-handed, but after that the show got better and better. The witch world is far more interesting than the mortal world. Most scenes with Sabrina's friends are boring and not very well written, but the witch world is gory, spooky and sometimes quite hilarious. I was surprised that some scenes were pretty dark and violent, but the show is so over the top that it did not get too scary. Towards the end, it became a bit unclear when it comes to what message the writers want to send. A lot of things did not feel right - especially, when it comes to Sabrina's decisions and actions. But if you don't think about it too much and just enjoy this dark, twisted world, then the show is a lot of fun. This show has so mych potient to be become a classic like it's earlier counterpart. I want to start of by talking about the positives about this show, because there are many to point out that I don't think should be over looked.<br/><br/>In the first episode Sabrina states the town "always feels like Halloween" in the opening scene but, we could have done without her saying this because you do get feeling of the atmosphere the writers are trying to convey. The creative camera angles and the well chosen colour overlay is something to applaud. The sound track is also well thought out and does a good job to further immerse you in the the town of Greendale. Besides the overuse of the blurring effects the setting is over all fantastic.<br/><br/>Another positive note I wanted to point out is the main story line. It seems as though the story may overlap with Netflix's original Riverdale, but unlike Riverdale the show isn't shallow and so over the top the unrealism takes you out of the story. Sure, the plot is about magic and the supernatural but, the world of witches is just realistic enough that it doesn't make you want to roll your eyes. The teenagers aren't overly sexualized and the actors look like they are the ages they are suppose to be.<br/><br/>Lastly, the relationship between Salem and Sabrina is in my opinion the most interesting one. Sabrina is suppose to be a martyr, and fight for the litte guys, and I love that. While in some areas she seems to contradict her moral beliefs, I absolutely loved how instead of choosing her familiar, she wanted an equal partnership and asked for one instead of demanding it. It tied in seamlessly well with the story and her character. The introduction of their relationship sparks a lot of questions and I am very interested to see where it goes.<br/><br/>The main problem I had with this show is that it is quite obviously sexist towards men. The show only seems to celebrate men who offer no real challenges to the proteganist. The first clue when sabrina punishes her principle by traumatizing him with his own anxieties, when she traumtizes the jocks at her school and when she tells harvey she is a witch, he begins to challenge her feels towards him and her loyalty to her friends as he clearly is having trouble believing her (resonably so). She take his freedom to process this information away immediatly to avoid have to confront it. She quite frequently contradicts her own moral standing, and seems to lack the maturity to handle adult situations. And this is the person we are suppose to be rooting for!<br/><br/>Lots of movies and tv shows have been about political movements (the classic V for Vendeda and the more modern Dear White People) But the characters are too immature and contradicting making the message hard to believe. The characters need to be more developed and a little less hateful. Paired with the great cinematography, musical soundtrack and well picked actors this show had the potential to become another darker more mature cult classic.
