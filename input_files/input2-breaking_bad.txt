I cannot stress enough how good this show is. I've watched a lot of TV in my life and this show still remains the best show I've ever seen. Re-Watched it 7 times and counting. I guess I liked it. Dont you ever watch this show as it is so perfect u will never be able to watch another show When you finish the show you'll never be the same..I guarantee you If you are among the few who haven't seen it yet: believe the hype, it really is THAT good. Breaking Bad may not depict reality the way 'Generation Kill' or 'The Wire' did - but then it's not about that, either. From an artistic point of view - performances, writing, direction, camera, music - this show is every bit as good as the other two mentioned above, but unlike those, 'Breaking Bad' just wants to entertain and therefore enjoys a lot more creative freedom.<br/><br/>The show plays like the daydream fantasy of any underachieving, struggling middle class family man who's had to bury all his dreams (I mean: who wouldn't want to be a meth-kingpin for a little while?), before it turns into a nightmare. One could almost say that 'Heisenberg' is Walter White's 'Tyler Durden'(for those who don't get the reference: watch 'Fight Club' - you won't regret it).<br/><br/>For pure entertainment value, this is simply the best show I've ever seen. Every single one of the main characters has already reached the status of a screen icon - when does that ever happen?! Most fun I've ever had watching a TV-show and an instant classic. The best series I have seen in my whole life, even better than the wire. If there is any show deserves a 10/10, it's Breaking Bad, Simply the greatest. I wanna delete my brain and watch it again like I never knew it. I was waiting to see how GOT ended. It should be the greatest but they failed miserably in the finale season especially the last 3 (mainly the finale) episode.<br/><br/>Writers need to take notes and be more like breaking bad. They had they ending planned out from the begging. They didn't try and build a massive brand or following behind the show and extend their seasons to do so. They stuck with their plan and created the greatest show we may ever see.<br/><br/>Thank you for existing. The most perfect show ever created. There will no other show like this one. Drug wars, meth, the lot. I thought no thank you. I kept hearing how good it was and I kept saying: "No thank you" Last January I got sick, one of those illnesses you can't quite figure out. Maybe it was pre and post election depression, I don't know. But I stayed in bed for almost 10 days and then it happened. I saw the first episode and I was immediately and I mean immediately, hooked. I saw the entire series in 9 days. Voraciously. Now I had time to reflect. Why I wonder. When I think about it the first thing that comes to mind is not a thing it's Bryan Cranston. I know the concept was superb as was the writing but Bryan Cranston made it all real. His performance, the creation of Walter White will be studied in the Acting classes of the future. He is the one that pulls you forward - as well as backwards and sideways - then I realized that his creation acquired the power that it acquired, in great part thanks to the extraordinary cast of supporting players. I could write a page for each one of them but I'm just going to mention Aaron Paul. I ended up loving him. I developed a visceral need to see him find a way out. Well, what can I tell you. I know that one day, maybe when my kids are old enough, I shall see "Breaking Bad" again. I can't wait. Binge-watching addiction, awe, esteem mixed with sulfurous hot pepper are some of the feelings and definitions that are experienced and come to mind when thinking and talking about Breaking Bad.<br/><br/>The one and only series where in every episode my jaw dropped for one minute throughout it.<br/><br/>The one and only series where the unfolding of the story and the episodes were flawless.<br/><br/>The one and only series where Meth was a beautiful, attractive and pure hypnotizing blue substance.<br/><br/>The one and only series where the name of Heisenberg was a Brand, driving you mad and forever anchored itself in your mind.<br/><br/>The one and only series where you wished you had your memory erased, to watch it again and again till end of your life.<br/><br/>And the one and only series where standard and quality were redefined all over again.<br/><br/>It was a true and personal honor to know and watch this show.
Kudos and special congratulations to every one of the persons involved, especially and foremost to Bryan Cranston. You will be forever missed.<br/><br/>Heisenberg, YOU MADE HISTORY. The plot is interesting, but like other good TV series, the difference is the attention to detail. In BB everything is in the right place at the right time. It involves you like a great TV series and is as robust as one of the best movies. 10+ I probably haven't been hooked to a TV show like I am to Breaking Bad before. This beautiful piece of art is incredibly well written and directed, furthermore the actors are doing a tremendous job! I've read a few remarks about the pace of the show, saying it is too slow. I completely disagree, there are so many aspects which get their place in the series, every single one in its own way and it would be horrible if we'd see a too fast paced show containing ridiculous cliffhangers like we see them on the major networks. Because this way you can entirely fall in love with the show, the characters and every tiny detail of the story and the best part of it, it is unbelievably addictive and makes you starve for more week after week! <br/><br/>10/10 <br/><br/>Kudos to Mr. Gilligan, kudos to Mr. Cranston and kudos to everyone else who's making a contribution to this show! "Breaking Bad" is the best television show. Ever.<br/><br/>We start out with one main character, Walter White (played by Bryan Cranston), who is struggling to make ends meet working both as a high school chemistry teacher and part time at a car wash. Then he gets diagnosed with cancer. Then he breaks bad.<br/><br/>Teaming up with an unlikely sidekick, Jesse Pinkman (played by Aaron Paul), who is the immature "yo, bitch"-spouting, high-school-screw-up small-time drug dealer, Walt and Jesse both put their skills towards the drug world to try to make good by their families.<br/><br/>This show has been masterfully put together with layer upon layer of insight into some of the most interesting characters ever realized in the history of television. We have some very dark characters, and a lot of grey characters, and it all adds up to brilliant dialogue and plot lines.<br/><br/>The creator, writers, directors and actors have paid attention to every single detail, putting thought into every nuance in every character in every scene. Because of this attention to detail there is something for everyone in this show. Every thinking brain will immediately be attracted to the intelligence so evidently on display, that even if you're not a drug dealing chemist living in Albuquerque, you will find something in the characters that connects you to them and makes you hang on for dear life.<br/><br/>Get on your couch now and start watching "Breaking Bad" from the very beginning, and don't miss a single scene. So I just finished this show today (8/31/19). This was one of the greatest, if not the greatest show I've ever seen. A true thrill ride from start to finish, and there was never a dull moment. A masterpiece all the way through if there ever was one. A great experience to remember. Thank you. 10/10 BREAKING BAD:Season One explodes like a sucker punch to the gut, and is nothing short of mind-blowing. The pilot for this series is a definite "Must See", and stands with the greats of Action/Adventure Television and Cinema. This segment begins at such a giddy peak, that you think the only way forward would be to tell the tale as a long flashback. However, through a marvelous piece of editing and writing, the plot miraculously moves forward from that point. Bryon Cranston's idiosyncratic performance is a joy to behold. He embodies a man who is against a rock, and an even harder place, who has no other option but to throttle his higher aspirations and grimly carry on. His solace and validation in middle-class morality and virtuous conduct is long gone. I eagerly look forward to more of this ambitious, entertaining series. 10/10, hands down. Objectively and subjectively a great show. It's #1 on my personal list - over South Park, X-Files, Friends, and Cheers.<br/><br/>I can't really say anything that hasn't already been said about this masterpiece, so I'll just say that the characters, story, and overall premise and writing are completely masterfully produced.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad will be remembered as a timeless classic. I have to echo another reviewer on here and say that as of the past many years I have not watched television, save PBS, Discovery, or History channel. And the news, of course. There has been nothing except The Sopranos and Family Guy in the realm of series that warranted my attention. Almost everything out there is stupid drivel that insults the intelligence of educated human beings. <br/><br/>But Now !! Now we have Breaking Bad !!!<br/><br/>All I can say is: HOLY S**T !!! This is the best television series I've ever seen, and really goes into the realm of feature films as well, as far as being in my top ten. I cannot think of anything as of late that punched me in the face like this show did. I absolutely love it. If you have not seen it, do yourself a HUGE favor and rent the first season so you'll know what's going on, and you can see the transition of the characters. This show is beautifully written with plot twists coming in refreshing ways, and at just the right times. Some of what is shown I was surprised they put it on television,... and that's a great thing !! The acting is brilliant, and the themes are amazing, timeless and timely, and are presented to us in thought provoking ways that leave me pondering philosophical ideas long after the show is over. Yeah, this is a TV series !!! On AMC !! Hard to believe. This is one I'm raving about to everyone I know, and hope keeps going for a long, long time !!! Thanks to everyone involved with this genius show !!! Literally the best show I have ever seen. Far from idealism, Breaking bad shows how the human greediness and the willingness to control can easily flip the coin in our minds and can change our conception and perspectives. No matter how educated you are, no matter what is your social status, you can easily sink in a swamp of sin, what it needs is blurry and fuzzy principles and a strong trigger to justify the acts. The character Walter white was the most influencing characters in the movie. The one who is between the hammer of sickness and the anvil of family. the character evolution of Whalter White, Jesse Pinkman and Skyler White is drastic and amazing at the same time. The show thought us that your acts today decide how you will be tomorrow. Absolutely one of the most ground breaking bad ass shows on the screen, (pardon the pun). Definitely not for everyone but finally something that feels real.<br/><br/>I personally like the fact they pull no punches. I find myself pausing at the fact that I am so intrigued by this hard core street wise program, more than any of the other big name series. This one really hits home and gives a true behind the scenes look at what most would consider the bad guys. I'm not condoning the contents of the story, and I don't think the show is either, there is no glamor in what these boys are doing, but it's giving an insight to the darker side of many streets. <br/><br/>How the denial and desperation that can occur to the common working stand up citizen, the pillar of society that suddenly changes his moral standing in a society driven by the almighty dollar. This is pretty dam close to Fallen (Michel Douglas) but with up to date street smarts nd a lot more punch. <br/><br/>The characters don't over exaggerate their roles and the story line isn't filled with cleaver dialog or near to impossible feats of bravery or beating impossible odds. Just true to life screwed up events that could take place in the real world. I think they did their research on this one. Good work everyone. <br/><br/>I hope we get more than a second and third season out of this great crew (every one of them). From the writing and production sets to the acting, costumes, lighting, filming and originality. I've seen a few good series lost to the wrong decision makers, hope this one doesn't end up short (long live FireFly)<br/><br/>Chuckbytes Many years ago, a friend of mine told me to watch this new series called Breaking Bad. The way he raved about it I thought I'd give it a go just to shut him up. I really couldn't get in to it and, after the pilot episode, gave up and didn't watch it any more.
Fast forward to 2019.
Looking through Netflix I came across this series once again so thought I'd give it another go.
Now, I don't know if I've changed in these past years or I just didn't give it long enough first time round but, Wow! Over the last three weeks I have binge watched the entire series, averaging four episodes a day (unfortunately I have to work as well). What can I say about this series that hasn't already been said by other reviewers who are more grammatically articulate than I am. It easy to see why Breaking Bad won as many awards as it did. The writing is superb, not to mention the acting from its two main stars, Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul as Walt and Jesse. By the end of the last episode I felt my heart was broken. Like a break up in a relationship I would now have to get by without these two in my life. It's been an emotional rollercoaster of a ride but I enjoyed every minute of it. From Jesse's awkward moment having dinner with Walt and Sky, to Walt's maniacal laughter whilst under the floorboards of his house.
So to my friend I owe an apology. I should have listened to you and watched this great show a long time ago. I cannot believe that I disregarded this series for nearly 12 years. I assumed that it was yet another American Soap Opera. My son persuaded me to give it a watch. I am so glad that he did. I have been engrossed for the last six weeks watching the full 5 series. I cannot rate this highly enough. The characters, the storyline, the acting, in fact everything about this series was astonishing. Quite frankly I am lost for superlatives by which to describe this production. I will watch it over again in 10 years time when I will be nearly 80. By that time my memory will have begun to deteriorate and it will be like watching it afresh. I can't wait.... The age of Bryan Cranston has returned. Once universally lauded for his work in Malcolm In The Middle, there had yet to be a good vehicle for this man's particular talents. He has that rare gift of generating sympathy and manic-energy at the same time.<br/><br/>For those that would be content to label this show a Weeds knock-off, bear in mind that Breaking Bad is a new kind of monster. It touches on the very same themes, "living realistically as a middle class in the United States" which often makes us resort to extremes to survive. Like the mother and daughter team that robbed that bank. But the weed selling antics of Showtime's hit show is really nothing like "Bad." The Pilot was about as perfect a Pilot as I've ever seen, and much of it rests on Bryan Cranston's shoulders.<br/><br/>Cranston plays Cheimstry teacher Walter White. He has a loving wife, a child with Cerebal Palsy and another is on the way. He also happens to be dying from an inoperable lung cancer situation, which happened although he "never smoked." His finances in disarray, the once great student of science turns to crime to solve his problems.<br/><br/>He cooks Crystal Meth with a good for nothing ex-student. From the antics of the first episode, the show is leading towards a dark place, but a place of truth. This is a no nonsense black comedy.<br/><br/>For people that love Tarantino or the Coen's, this might be your cup of tea. Everybody has their own opinion of how many stars a show deserves, whether more stars or fewer it's seldom so many people agree. "Breaking Bad" is possibly the best TV drama ever made - there isn't a wrong step, bad episode or miscast character throughout the whole series run. <br/><br/>A willing suspension of disbelief is an absolute requirement to enjoy this drama. It is probably not plausible to believe that anyone like Walter White could succeed as a meth chemist for even one season without being killed or caught let alone the 62 episodes the series has. But the tight, virtually seamless story, and the sympathetic characters, who nearly all resonate with most viewers, make you willing to set aside any differences with plausibility (which, admittedly, the show takes huge liberties with). <br/><br/>Like most serials it is best not to watch the show out of order! More then any other series, huge changes in plot, story and character arc take place so fast you are likely to be completely lost if you skip episodes. And the show is the proverbial roller coaster, taking you to the low points and peaks right along with your favorite characters, you might not want to miss a minute in this original and daring TV drama once you start watching! Fantastic story and character development. Season 1 is a little slow but it pays off. Amazing acting by Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul, Anna Gunn, Giancarlo Esposito, Bob Odenkirk, Jonathan Banks, and others. I really recommend this show. Also stop hating on the fly episode, it has great meaning if you dig deep enough.<br/><br/>Also stop comparing BB to GOT. They are completely different shows and you cannot decide which one is better than the other. They are both fantastic shows. After the last and utterly disappointing season of Game of Thrones it's finally crystal clear that Breaking Bad is the greatest TV show ever made. Vince Gilligan and the fellow incredible writers of Breaking Bad please save Game of Thrones and team up with HBO to remake the utterly disappointing season 8. We can only dream that much though. Breaking Bad on the contrary with Game of Thrones ended on a very high note that complemented the quality of the previous seasons and even surpassed them. Breaking Bad is a monolithic milestone of television and cinematic art form in general and quite possibly the greatest character study and arc ever presented on the cinematic medium. Breaking Bad serves as an enchanting vignette of sin, the importance of family, power and its corrupting influence, envy and regret, evolution and decay, rise and fall and this seamlessly intertwined amalgamation of brilliant direction, impeccable writing, gorgeous and stylish cinematography, excellent soundtrack, incredible pacing, intricate plotting, captivating story, very extensive thematic depth, rich characterization and exquisite performances put on by its stellar cast, all contribute into making one of the greatest and pieces of cinema ever made with some of the finest characters ever written. With GoT out of the way Breaking Bad solidifies itself as the greatest TV show of all time with the Wire being a close second on my list. I have watched pretty much everything out there and still no show is as good as Breaking Bad. I've watched this series twice, going on three times and still as good as the first time (maybe even better). Give me a thumbs up if you agree nothing beats it. Not a series it's like a lesson of someone to the whole community , i found it not acting scene it feels like a hidden cameras was hanged in mr. White house After many friends recommending me the show i had finally started watching it.. I could not get out of it.. i did not come out of my room for 3 days and completed 5 seasons eventually.. i could not cope with the end of the show and i could not find anything that can top this show.It intensifies season by season.. IT'S ALL ABOUT REACTIONS.. Acting 5/5 Plot 6/5 Score 4/5 Overall feel 22/10 There are no words to describe how great this show is so stop reading this review and start watching it.. It's 2019, I always heard good things from the show: It being 5th on top tv shows of all time on IMDB and the general talk about how this show is one of those rare ones that just gets better and better with each season. I had seen it was on Netflix but I never watched it until now because it was 5 seasons long and it just felt like I was going to have to commit a lot of time.<br/><br/>In all my boredom I finally decided to start watching it with no intention on actually finishing it. I just wanted to see the first few episodes to waste time on the day and see how the show is. I watched the first three episodes of the first season and I was intrigued. I thought it was good, but not to the level I was being told it was. I eventually got to halfway through the second season and I stopped watching for about a week. I wanted to see this badass Mr White that everyone was talking about but I was dissatisfied with how far he was from that at the S2E5 mark. I grew impatient and decided to stop. This is completely my fault. Not the show's. I knew there had to be a story behind his transformation but I didn't have the commitment to see it. After a week I finally decided to watch S2E6 and after that I was immediately hooked. Less than 2 weeks later I had finished watching the entire show. I just couldn't stop.<br/><br/>For some reason I thought the show would end with Mr White being a badass, taking out all the bad guys and living happily ever after with his family. I had no idea it would turn into a tragedy story: a man desperate to earn money to provide for his family for when he dies of cancer, ends up losing his family as they hate the man he has become. This show becomes very dark in its final stages. Jesse and Walter become enemies in the final season. Hank and Andrea are mercilessly shot in the head. Walter's family and the entire country turn against him. I actually teared a little when Walter saw his baby daughter, Holly, for the last time in the final episode; not even a month had passed since S1E1 but I still cried, that's how good this show is.<br/><br/>This is a messy review and I dont care.<br/><br/>If you're in a similar position to what I was in: wanting to watch the show but not feeling committed to its 5 season duration - just go for it. You won't be disappointed. Since the last season of GoT was trash, GoT fans have come in waves to rate BB 1/10 out of pure bitterness. I am here to combat this, so here's a 10/10.<br/><br/>Also, Breaking Bad is a really great TV show. <ul><li>All Together - 99/100 (Favorite Episode: Felina)</li></ul><br/><br/>1 - Season Five - 100/100 (Favorite Episode: Felina)<br/><br/>2 - Season Four - 99/100 (Favorite Episode: Face Off)<br/><br/>3 - Season Three - 99/100 (Favorite Episode: Full Measure)<br/><br/>4 - Season One - 98/100 (Favorite Episode: Pilot)<br/><br/>5 - Season Two - 98/100 (Favorite Episode: Grilled)<br/><br/>_________________________________<br/><br/>⭐Screenplay: 100/100<br/><br/>⭐Acting Performance: 99/100<br/><br/>⭐Film Editing: 98/100<br/><br/>⭐Cinematography: 98/100<br/><br/>⭐Visual Effects: 93/100<br/><br/>⭐Sound Effects: 96/100<br/><br/>⭐Art Direction & Set Decoration: 96/100<br/><br/>⭐Original Scores: 95/100<br/><br/>⭐Makeup: 97/100<br/><br/>⭐Costume Design: 95/100<br/><br/>_________________________________<br/><br/>This serie is unique. This is somehow realistic and amazing also. I have watched so many "Based On A True Story" movies but none of them real amazing for me. (Just A Beautiful Mind was very good.)<br/><br/>I don't know how script writers think this serie. It is real complicated and amazing story. I did watch this serie twice. I tried to find nonsense parts. I just found two nonsense things in all five seasons. It is best crime, drama TV series possible. Amazing storyline, acting, cinematography. Definetly it is the best tv serie of all time. This is by far the greatest TV show ever.<br/><br/>I was expecting the typical path every show takes with the same old predictable directions they go in, but luckily I didn't read online and knew nothing of the spoilers. As a result, I was taken in and blown away.<br/><br/>The casting alone is brilliant. Every single character was casted perfectly, and I mean perfectly. That alone is genius and falls along the lines of Pulp Fiction with the way Travolta, Thurman, and Samuel L Jackson were casted, along with Harvey Keitel.<br/><br/>But then you get absorbed into this world you never thought you would meet, nor have you ever seen before. You keep waiting for it to become a typical show and for it to "jump the shark", but as the seasons progress, you just never witness or experience that at all.<br/><br/>Instead, the show actually takes you to a place that you never saw coming (if you didn't know spoilers), and it is actually a place of truth. This experience defies twenty or more years of cinema, including the movies.<br/><br/>No matter what anyone says, I don't care, this is possibly the greatest cinematic experience I have witnessed as a whole since the mid-90's. You cannot even compare it to other TV shows, really, because it is not a TV show as much as it is a 60 hour movie that never circles or tangents itself like every other "TV show".<br/><br/>The acting is incredible. Every single actor or actress nailed their role. The subtexts, themes, and profundity is all in there, but not everyone will find those things. A masterpiece?.....Is there a term for something beyond a masterpiece? If there was, then this is it.<br/><br/>20/10 I started watching Breaking Bad quite late (around the time of my first year in college, so we're talking 2012-2013, right before the final season aired) Everybody was praising the show to death, so eventually I gave in and decided to see for myself what all the fuss was about.<br/><br/>Wow. Just wow.<br/><br/>While the show has quite an unusual premise, it takes you along for the ride in every sense of the word. Bryan Cranston as Walter White has to be one of the best character portrayals I've ever seen. A major transition from Hal in Malcolm in the Middle. He succeeds in capturing every nuance of White, from overworked square to calculating crime lord.<br/><br/>Aaron Paul's performance as Jesse Pinkman is fantastic also, displaying the utter tragedy of a wannabe meth peddler who happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. His dynamic with Cranston's White is brilliant and their chemistry (pardon the pun) is tough to beat.<br/><br/>The cinematography throughout the show is beautiful. As a film graduate, I have the utmost respect for the production team for some of the shots and scenes they have captured over the duration of the show's airing. The editing as well should be heavily praised as well.<br/><br/>As I said, for an unlikely setup; an overworked high school chemistry teacher diagnosed with lung cancer teaming up with a former pupil to cook methamphetamine to finance his family after he dies, it draws you into the drama.<br/><br/>The supporting cast add so much to the story also. The likes of Gus Fring, Mike Ehrmantraut, Saul Goodman and Hank Schrader are instrumental to the development of the story and are excellently portrayed by the respective actors.<br/><br/>People give Skyler a hard time for always being on Walt's back but let's take it from her perspective: her husband has become involved in a business that could potentially bring about the deaths of everyone in her family? Seems like a reasonable excuse to oppose him.<br/><br/>In a sense, Walter Jr. is kinda the weak link. I mean, yeah fair enough, the actor and character has cerebral palsy, and RJ Mitte does a good job as the character, but he really doesn't go beyond eating breakfast in terms of character development, which is a shame. I would have loved to have seen a scene where he meets Jesse and confronts him. Ah well, too late now.<br/><br/>Aside from this, Breaking Bad remains a masterpiece of television. This show is like an amalgamation of the greatest crime movies ever made, without ever feeling or coming across like it's copying from them and separating itself as its own unique thing with a completely original premise. It's like the story of Walter White glides through an anthology of classic crime movies without any lines drawn between which and where they begin or end.<br/><br/>Whether you are a fan of Pulp Fiction, Scarface, The Usual Suspects, Departed, Goodfellas, American Beauty, Heat, even the Terminator and a touch of the Shining, or an ironic list of other famous films of different genres, you will find similar bits, pieces, semblances, as well as homages to them from time to time throughout. But don't expect any one of those films as a whole because this is a totally unique piece of art in itself.<br/><br/>The most entertaining aspect of the show for me was the Business part about it- the way the money is handled and the businesses are created, conducted, and operating are startlingly and impressively realistic in every way into every last detail. The drama, family, relationships, morality, crime genre, dark humor, and character development are all excellent or magnificent, but the realistic way the show handles the business aspect of the show was so impressive and really blew me away. The amount of detail that went into the story construction reveals that the creators did their homework, research, hired experts, and have had their own life experience with entrepreneurship and the business world.<br/><br/>
It is also important to the story because it is the main catalyst in the protagonists' profound motivations, which makes so much sense. This also branches off into money laundering and lots of big business meetings and dealings. The hierarchy of who is the boss, who is the helper, employee, partner, investor, associate, competitor, and new hire is perfectly arranged and realistic.<br/><br/>In addition, the protagonist must deal with the growing pains of the business world. Like many entrepreneurs, he succeeds and fails, starts over at times, restructures, learns the ropes, exploits advantages with his product in certain markets, and tries to reach a potential, or at least his goal.<br/><br/>The business aspect is more of an impersonal construct of the show, but it is the character development of not just the protagonist, but several main characters, that are incredibly conceived that is the best person part about the show. When you first meet many of the characters, they seem insignificant, or like they are going to be conventional side characters that only appear on the peripherals from time to time, but you can be surprised who these people really are or how significant they might be.<br/><br/>There are huge surprises, twists, turns, and mindblowing moments along the way, but don't expect them constantly. The show really takes its time in developing the characters, plot, and story- fleshing out its own world in the sunny Albuquerque suburbs and desert area- before it seldom pulls the trigger.<br/><br/>The first season and a half delve heavily into the protagonist's battle with cancer and the affect it has on him and his family, but they also introduce plenty of drama, suspense, action, and surprises. Dark humor is one of the predominant features of this part of the show. If you don't enjoy dark humor, you may find it slow at times, but if you stick with it, you will definitely be rewarded in the later seasons. If you do enjoy the humor, then this will probably become your favorite show.<br/><br/>From late season 2 to the end of season 3, the show begins to turn slightly darker and become far more dramatic. There is family drama, drug drama, and crime drama. Season 4 is stunning and will blow the viewer away with brilliant writing, plot development, plenty of surprises, and nonstop suspense. It is loaded with classic scenes and episodes.<br/><br/>Season 5 is my personal favorite, as there is unbelievably no fat at all in any episode, for the most part, and this is the final season where all loose ends and everything revealed in seasons 1-4 all come back into play and receive closure, which elevates the entire meaning of everything that came before it.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad is wickedly popular among fans, critics, and many top professionals in Hollywood, or the film industry in general. It has influenced, inspired, impacted so many writers, directors, actors, producers, and cinematographers. There are several popular shows and movies that have come out since it aired where you can pick up on direct borrowing and sort of imitating many things that Breaking Bad did on all different levels from story/plot, writing, character development, editing, and overall concept. Some people who have seen shows or films Breaking Bad influenced prior to watching it may not be as affected by some of its brilliance since they are working backward on the timeline.<br/><br/>The acting in it is truly amazing. It probably is the best acted TV series of all time without a doubt. Bryan Cranston delivers one of the best acting performances ever, but the supporting cast is almost just as good. Usually, there is a dropoff in tv shows in movies; you'll have one or two great performances, but the rest of the smaller supporting cast is basic and average, but in Breaking Bad, there are truly excellent performances and the roster runs deep. This is the kind of show or movie where even the smallest roles are memorable. There really isn't one bad actor in any part of the series, and that's part of what makes it so good.<br/><br/>Last, I'll mention the dialogue, quotes, and lines. I was not expecting this at all, but this show is loaded with famous lines and dialogue. It all ties back into the script writing, which is brilliant. So many scenes will blow you away with the witty, realistic dialogue and quotes. This is the hallmark of a classic work of film art. It just exceeds expectations for a TV series.<br/><br/>Once you are finished watching this masterpiece, watch it again because there is so much attention to detail that you can't pick up on in your first watch. There are all kinds of foreshadowing, symbolism, references, and little details that will make you appreciate it even more. This is not a show where one watch is enough. It gets better every time you watch it. Also, be sure to learn about the making of it, behind the scenes, the story of how it got made, all the Emmy awards and other awards it won, the records it set, what other prestigious names in Hollywood like Anthony Hopkins said about it, and all of the greatly written articles on it. It will really help you cope with it ending. But a warning: it is so addictive and good that you will probably find it difficult to let go, and every other show in the future will pale in comparison.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen Breaking Bad yet, do yourself a favor and experience this once in a lifetime classic. Avoid any spoilers, and it will be ten times as good like it was for me and first time viewers during its airing. Season 1 : 8.8/10
Season 2 : 8.8/10
Season 3 : 9.5/10
Season 4 : 9.8/10
Season 5 : 10/10 Breaking bad is the best show I have ever watched, with an amazing story, the GREATEST acting, especially Walt and Jesse. Many may stop watching this because of the first 5 episodes but PLEASE KEEP WATCHING. I felt the same but the "long" intro on Wlat's boring and horrible life is CRUCIAL in order to understand this psychological masterpiece.<br/><br/>ALL SEASONS RANKED:
Season 1: 9/10
Season 2: 10/10
Season 3: 8/10
Season 4: 9.5/10
Season 5: 10+/10 Since the invention of motion picture, this is the greatest thing ever made I have never fully enjoyed a series like breaking bad , it was so realistic and emotional . What a great job Vince! If I had to characterize Breaking Bad in comparison to other high-quality TV shows, I would call it "the show that never did anything wrong". BrBa has a flawless storyarc, which neatly connects the first episode of season 1 with the final episode of season 5. The ending of the series, which has often been the weak point of many other great shows, feels almost inevitable - as many great endings in literature also do.<br/><br/>There is so much to be praised about this show. What impressed me most was perhaps the attention to detail. This is also the show where no loose end was ever forgotten - and, if not tied up, it would usually come back to haunt Walter White or some other character. There is also a strong sense of fate or even karma in this show - at one point literally hitting the protagonist out of the blue sky (if you have seen the show, you understand the reference). Walter White's cancer in the end becomes a metaphor for his own malice, that is slowly metastasizing in his soul. In the end, the philosophical question is whether one becomes bad because of one's deeds (while continuously rationalizing them as necessary and inevitable) or whether one does bad things because it is already part of one's character. The title, "Breaking Bad", seems to point towards the latter, whereas the ending of the show rather points towards the former.<br/><br/>The show often uses metaphor and allusion - sometimes in a way that will only be noticed by the most attentive of observers. For example, the curious model of a car Walter drives has been known to be a "underachiever" with unrealized potential, much like his owner. Minor details like an unrepaired crack in a windshield or a rotting pizza on a roof are constant reminders of the sinister events that have seeped into the suburban lifestyle - and they are milestones of Walter's moral journey into darkness, until things are beyond repair. Keep in mind that this is the man who feels compelled to "fix things" like a random shaky table with a napkin, but who becomes so power-hungry that he eventually declares: "I'm not in the money business. I'm not in the drug business. I'm in the empire business."<br/><br/>The psychology of Walter White would lend itself to filling pages, but the same could be said for many other characters. I will never look at harmless hobbies like rock-collecting in the same way again - and the color purple has also gained some unpleasant connotations. I have also learned that a Roomba cannot fix a broken home and childhood.<br/><br/>Perhaps the last piece of praise: the whacky humor of the show. There were moments when I simply did not know whether I should laugh or cry (I will never be able to use an ATM without thinking of this show). BrBa also has it's very unique take on American consumer culture and middle class suburban lifestyle - there is a lot of brilliant social and political commentary in this show (which, by the way, has been further developed in "Better Call Saul").<br/><br/>Altogther, this show is a nearly perfect package and incredibly well-crafted. Do not miss out! No movies even come close to this challenging, mind and soul bending, character study of various mobsters converging in the most desperate times to an intricate climax where truth will be revealed that echoes into eternity.<br/><br/>Greatest piece of film art in three decades, hands down. You have to go back to Pulp Fiction in 1994 to find something this unique, original, yet competent enough to become a legit masterpiece.<br/><br/>All Hail the King. In 2030...
Son: What is Breaking Bad?
Me: Let me tell you the story of greatest tv show ever created... I don't think that there will be series in the level of breaking bad...It is mysterious, has incredible actors and epic story. it is recommended for everybody When I decided to start writing reviews for all of the TV shows that I have seen at least 1 season of, I started with my least favorites, and worked my way up. Now I'm finally here, at my top 3 favorite shows of all time, and I'm thinking to myself, why? Why would I want to write a review about such a popular show, that has probably had every thing imaginable written about it already? Well, I'm a completionist, and I'll see this through, but what I have to say about this series will most likely be what you've heard before. So, all that being said, I'll try to keep it short, and sweet.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad, simply put, is one of television's best programs. AMC lucked out when they first picked it up, because it's largely considered by many, to be one of the best TV shows of our time. Thanks to Breaking Bad, The Walking Dead, and Mad Men; AMC made the transition from American Movie Classics, to something more, as they advertise themselves as. These interpersonal, character driven dramas, are truly special, and are some of the best TV out there. Back to Breaking Bad, you've heard it all before. It excels in acting, writing, directing, character development, plot, etc.<br/><br/>This is my favorite series, right alongside AMC's other cultural phenomenon; The Walking Dead. The two have many similarities, namely in the character department. Both put the characters first, and that makes them all the better. Personally, when I'm watching a show, I find connection to the characters, and the subsequent development of them, to be the most important thing. Breaking Bad fills this criteria.<br/><br/>Overall, the highlight of Breaking Bad, to me at least, is it's great characters, and acting from its awesome cast. Bryan Cranston leads this show to greatness as Walter White. All of the seasons of this show are amazing, but season 5 is particularly phenomenal, and definitely one of the best single seasons of a show I've ever seen. Although I might be biased, this show is one of the 3 that I believe everyone should watch at least once in their lifetime, along with Lost and The Walking Dead. The powerful themes, incredible acting, thought provoking scenarios, and emotional moments make these programs valuable views. As a result, Breaking Bad will stand the test of time.<br/><br/>My Rating: 10/10 I just needed to say this: Best TV show in TV history until today and probably ever.
Thankful to have been alive to watch it as it aired.
Words will never make this show justice.
A masterpiece. To date, this is the only show that not only never falters in quality, but is consistently fantastic for all five seasons. It deserves all the praise it gets and more. It holds the title of my favorite show with an iron grip and won't let go any time soon. This series set in the years 2008-2009 is a must, I cannot recommend it enough. With an apparently not very appealing central plot (without spoiler), a 50-year-old high school chemistry teacher in Albuquerque diagnosed with stage-3 lung cancer who takes the decision to produce and sell drugs with a former student, the series grabs you in a witty plot full of suspense, black humor and violence during which the main character, Walter White played by Bryan Cranston, evolves while the spectator's feelings towards him do so as well.<br/><br/>Once you finish watching it, it does not leave you indifferent, at the same time some unanswered question make you think about, why not, a spin-off or a potential continuation of the series in the future. As the clueless, hapless and hopeless father of four on the celebrated series MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE, Bryan Cranston came into his own, as he did an amazing balancing act that juggled slapstick, pathos and insanity all at once, proving that not only did "father NOT know best", but more than likely never would.<br/><br/>Now he essays the role of another father in the new series BREAKING BAD, but it's a shocking, bracingly refreshing turn that takes his 'Three Stooges' repertoire of grunts, shrieks, barks and neurotic ticks and virtually throws them out the window. Some of those qualities are still there, but unlike MALCOLM, BREAKING is the blackest of black comedies. When I first heard about it, the reviews I read compared it heavily (and favorably) to the Coen Brothers' dark crime comedy FARGO. And the comparisons are aptly warranted.<br/><br/>This is one of those series where the less you know about it going in, the better, but just to set your mind reeling with the possibilities, here it is in a nutshell: Cranston plays high school chemistry teacher Walter White, who is constantly battling the lackadaisical attitudes of his disinterested students, the looming specter of financial disaster - by supplementing his paltry teacher's salary with a second job at a local car wash, and trying to cope with the impending arrival of a new baby, even as he and his wife raise their disabled teenage son, whom unlike many stereotypical portrayals of handicapped kids is no Pollyanna-like angel. <br/><br/>Then in the midst of all this, Walter makes a shocking discovery: he has inoperable lung cancer, and therefore only a few years left to live at best. Facing the very real possibility of leaving his family struggling not only with his death, but a financial situation that could only end in catastrophe, Walter suddenly has a revelation, thanks to an idea handed to him by his boorish brother-in-law, who works with the DEA - he decides to become a crystal meth dealer. <br/><br/>Okay, so while you're letting your brain take that all in, you also need to know that this is one of those defining roles where you just know that the lead actor will get Emmy recognition, whether he intended to or not. That is just how good Cranston is as Walter. In fact, he's every bit as good as Michael C. Hall's Dexter Morgan, James Gandolfini's Tony Soprano or Harold Perrineau's criminally under-appreciated Augustus Hill. And he's backed by an amazing supporting cast of mostly new or unfamiliar faces (with the exception of Dean Norris as the brother-in-law).<br/><br/>You can tell from the word 'go' that writer/producer/director Vince Gilligan (former head writer/exec producer on THE X FILES) has been champing at the bit for a while to let fly with a project like this. And if the first episode is any indication, AMC has another real winner on its hands. So MAD MEN will need to move over and make some room...since BREAKING BAD isn't the kind of series to "ask nicely."<br/><br/>Which brings up another important point: this is not a series for everyone, the way that FARGO and Showtime's kindred-spirit drug dramedy WEEDS are not mainstream, either. This is sharp, biting, satirical social commentary that draws blood when it sinks its teeth in, and you are guaranteed to wince even as you laugh out loud at Cranston's dead-on portrayal of a MAN on the edge of a nervous breakdown (well, more like over the edge.)<br/><br/>A caveat for would-be viewers, though, and a very ironic one at that: AMC has applied its ham-fisted method of editing its movies to this series as well, unfortunately, making the channel the LAST place you want to see it. The best thing to do is to check out the premiere episode whenever you can catch a rerun on AMC, then hustle on over to iTunes and download it so you can watch it again. Some very important scenes and some impressive establishing shots have been "edited for time and content" from the broadcast version, and this is material that IS essential to your experience viewing this show. There is a lot more to the characters and situations than you will be allowed to see on basic cable. So as you watch, keep that in mind.<br/><br/>And after you are done marveling at this magnificent character study sketched in desperation, you can wonder as I did, whether Bryan Cranston will bother preparing a speech for next year's Emmys. I sure hope he does...thanks to his work on BREAKING BAD, he'll need it. Breaking Bad is and will probably always be one of my absolute favorite shows. Can't really add anything that hasn't already been written by so many other Breaking Bad fans - the character developments, the fine details, the suspense and thrill - I rarely cry during series/movies but I've watched all the seasons four times now and the last episode will forever make me tear up and just feel so many emotions at once.
Everytime it's over I always feel so full and empty at the same time.<br/><br/>Then I wait 1-2 years and watch it all again. This show is truly a work of art. Every episode is excellent, so the quality of the series is very reliable. 10/10. Breaking Bad = Freaking Sad. This is the best series I have ever seen till now. Love the thrilling story, direction, cinematography, performances of all the characters. No series can replace Breaking Bad for me for the best series I ever watched. What a outstanding Show it is. How Good the can be after this. Not a single Sequence of the season is dull.
Most iconic Acting Performance from each Charecters
Walter White & Jesse PinkMan Oh my Ghod ! I really do not want to call Them with their original names even
Strong Story , Best Screenplay , Best Plot till now.Even Each episode has Cracking Dialogues. I mean if you have not watched BB
"You are in Danger & I am the Man who knocks the Door" Dedicated to Breaking Bad, the best show I've ever seen. Watching this show makes my life whole. Best show on tv. Every actor, the script and direction. Everything is perfect about this show. I would recommend everyone to watch this series. Its one of the best I've ever seen with best performance by almost every Celebrities I believe I've been waiting my entire life for this TV show. I'm not sure whether I haven't seen it because I was too young or maybe I just didin't like the whole drug deal, but since the moment I started watching, I fell in love with this masterpiece immediately. I watched all seasons two times already and am still not able to move since this art was just so thriving I couldn't get over it after two years. Why? There are so mamy reasons.<br/><br/>1. Stuning performances.
a) Acting.
The acting was not just great, it was something you don't see everyday. Since it was a story about one man's evolution, breaking bad, Bryan Cranston had to put so much effort for getting Walter White right, and if I haven't seen BrB I wouldn't believe that he is a great actor. His voice, his movements and facial expressions were exacly what made it even better. Aaron Paul's Jesse was something extraordinary. At first he seems to be just some stupid average drug addict, but at the time we understand he is so much more: Jesse's sympathetic, compassionate, good and honest friend who truly cares for Walt, even if Walt doesn't appreaciate that at all. To add to this, producers decision to pick comedians for their roles was truly geniuous - it turned out really well.
b) Relationship.
Walter and Skyler's relationship seems to be passive agressive. No matter what Walt does, although we know that his decisions and actions are not for the best, is just bad for Skyler, she keeps pushing him to his limits and in the end she's the one who's in pain, because she never truly understood her husband's desires and dreams. On the other hand I felt sorry for Skyler since she tried so hard to make money even when she was pregnant (she sold her own old stuff) and desperately wanted to make everyone at home feel better, but eventually she failed, because neither Walt nor Walt Junior didin't appreciate it. Thus, none of them is the villain, none of them is the victim. Both of them are just people who tried to understand each other, but horribly failed.
Walter and Jesse's relationship somehow reminds me of father-son relationship. In fact, there are few scenes where Walter calls Jesse his "son" which make us feel like we're here to witness something special between them. Jesse needs Walt as a father figure in his life, the one who helps him to make right decisions, who teaches him, etc, while Walt needs Jesse to boost his self-esteem, to maintain the idea of him as "the king". And that's where the dark part of their relationhips comes to light. We realize that perhaps Walt never really cared about Jesse as much as Jesse cared about Walt. Walt kept insulting Jesse and he suffered for all Walts crimes. Everything wrong that Walt did affected Jesse in the worst way possible. But it still seems to be that there were some kind of sparkle between them because in the last "Felina" episode Walt sacrifises his own life for Jesse's freedom, despite the fact it was his fault that Jesse had been imprisoned. To sum up, I could say they're relationship is more like God/father-Jesus/son relationship.
Jesse and Mike's relationship are the ones I loved the most. They are somewhat like Walt and Jesse's relationship except they weren't so toxic and when being with Mike Jesse didin't feel so sad and neglected. Mike truly cared for Jesse, he wanted he to be safe, alive and have a good life. And Jesse was just that true good character in the show - he showed compassion to everyone, even the ones who where seemingly not worth it. I believe that his care for Jesse made Walt kill Mike in the final season. Perhaps Walt thought that Mike had too much impact on Jesse.<br/><br/>2. Scenaristic.
a) Camera.
How the camera rolls is just something fantastic! Weird point of views, shocking shots, bird fly views and many others. Just remember that scene where Walt finds out that his money are gone forever and the way he laughs in that hole. This is the thing you don't see everyday and it has huge impact on viewers mind and mood. Camera often moves not the way we want to, in the positions that are uncomfortable to watch and makes us feel a little bit lost. But that's just it. Amazing. Magical. Inspiring. And realistic.
b) Colors.
The colors basically make the story. From Walts clothes to Mexican landscape and blue crystal clear meth - everything makes sense. Talking about Walt's clothes, the change should be noticed since it's quite obvious. In the first few episodes, seasons 1 and 2 Walts clothes were soft, calm and earth-coloured and throughout the rest of the series they kept turning darker and darker. Bright yelowish and orange landscape colours create true mood of hotness, steam and pressure which leads us while we're watching cooking and intense action scenes. Bright blue color of meth Walter and Jesse cook might symbolize sanctity and purity of this crystal ice.<br/><br/>3. Evolution.
a) A man's duty.
Breaking Bad starts it's story by introducing us to a man who's main duty and purpose of life is to provide for his family. And that's what Walter White does. He works as a chemistry teacher at a high school where his abilities and potencial are underrated. He puts a lot of effort just to pay bills, taxes and keep the house he has for now. His son is disabled and bullied, wife is seven months pregnant with an unplaned child. And, furthermore, Walter dicovers that he has lung cancer which means that after he dies his family will remain with no money source. While being in this deep dump hole Walter White has no other choice just to search for other ways to gain money for his loved ones before he dies. And that's when his chemistry knowledge comes hand to hand with making crystal meth. Though even if at first Walter says that he cooks meth for money, to make sure his family will remain safe and not poor when he is gone, in the end he admits that he did it not because of his family, but because he liked it and he was good at it. Despite the fact that Walt was good at chemistry and found his Ikigai only when he turned fifty, this story is about the type of men which is so rare nowadays - a provider. The one who feels responsible for his wife and children, the one who ignores his own desires in order to make his loved ones happy. It's a story about a man who tried to supress his wishes and dreams, but in the end failed epically. So, what this TV show teaches us? That we should always reach our dream, do what we're good at and what we love, otherwise our life won't be as fullfilled as it could be. But we must never forget why we are doing all of this - because of the ones that make us feel loved and cared. Still, Walt is a man, who's duty is different than purpose. He's one of the most difficult characters in TV show history.<br/><br/>b) From protagonist to antagonist.
Walter White's journey from good to bad, his personality evolution is one of the greatest illustrated development of all time. To say this program has great writing is an understatement. BB has the best writing I have ever had the pleasure of listing & reading (I always leave the captioning on). The acting is top notch by Cranston. It is also very good by Aaron Paul (Pinkman), Dean Norris (Hank), Betsy Brandt (Marie), RJ Mitte (Walt junior). Unfortunately, it feels like Anna Gunn (Skyler) is the weak link. It is hard to know if the Gilligan is trying to make a somewhat awkward and unlikable character, or if it is just not hitting the mark. I prefer to think that the writing is intentionally odd for Skyler for some reason, and that we will get to learn more in the episodes and seasons to come. The dialogue is absolutely brilliant for the most part â€“ it almost always rings true. The episodes are gripping (for the most part). The story is brutal and comedic at the same time. I have to opt for a 10/10 because there is not another program that comes close â€“ even Dexter which I've been enjoying for 5 seasons doesn't have the writing or acting to stand up to BB. Can't believe I didn't watch this for years until my partner played an episode of it (his third time then)<br/><br/>Never binged watch a series in my life but damn.. This is the only show I'll honestly give a perfect 10 for. I've watched the whole 5 episodes 3 times and still sit in awe at the end. I don't think a series can be any better. Bryan Cranston(Walt) put on a legendary performance. Aaron Paul( Pinkman)was amazing and Anna Gunn( Skylar) is such a character.I could write a whole 10 page review about how good the show is and won't still be enough. Special thanks to the whole crew who made this possible. From the first time i watched it, i've been thinking to watch it more. Really love this series, it's masterpiece from the cinematography, acting, character, also the moral lesson. After i watched it, i'm awake to make my own choices. Also, i've learned something from this series which is a person can change in any circumstances and we can't adjudicate without knowing the cause. If you are looking for a great storyline series then this series is the best series I have ever seen
People might tell you that the series have some boring episode or a complete season but believe me they are absolutely not boring it is just skillful execution of story which might be boring for some people
The story has been filled with all kinds of emotions
Action, thrill,emotional every part of it is just awesome just go simply and watch it!!!! I just rewatched this serie after 5 years. And i would never take the time to watch a serie twice, but this one just gets better and better. It left me speechless, and after the final episode i was staring into a void. How can humans create such masterpiece? A lot of people around me dropped out and didn't finish all seasons because, according to them, it got a bit lenghty and 'repetitive'.. God i'm glad i'm not one of them. The last season is the best drama i've ever seen on TV. When Hank finds out about Walt, it's the most emotional rollercoaster i've ever experienced on screen. Do yourself a favor and watch it, you will most likely be one of those guys like me, who are receptive to this show and will love it more than anything ever written!<br/><br/>All hail the king!
~W.W. Watched it like thrice and never getting bored of watching and onserving Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul and all the other co stars acting..
Simply this show is amazing. The writing, characters, and direction of this show is impeccable. I have yet to see any show that tops it. I consider it to be the best show ever made that even puts up a fight against the best movies ever made. I loved this movie, i hope you will make another season ! Story 10/10, acting 10/10, screenplay 10/10, direction 10/10, characters development 10/10, result:10. It s really difficult to express how good this is, it is so good that makes me dislike any other series, truly this changed my life. Wow! what a hell of a journey it was!
BReaking BAd is seriously something worth watching!
Keep patience on season 1, and 'when you're in, you're in'.<br/><br/>Fantastic characters, Screenplay, Plot, Direction..It was a masterpiece of these kind.<br/><br/>Best series I've ever watched!<br/><br/>
(& Don't miss 'Better call Saul', prequel of Breaking Bad.
Maybe It'd be interesting If you watch in this order: 'Better call Saul', then 'Breaking Bad' & atlast 'EL Camino'.) I love Breaking Bad, I watch this 3 times....................... I've seen all episodes... 3 times! I've started many TV-shows where I get bored already in the beginning or when I can feel that producer's lack of ideas and still trying to keep tv-show alive but NOT with Breaking Bad! I never get bored! GOT fans, are you crazy? You can not recognize that BB best tv show ever? Why you give low grades? Are you accusing BB that GOT final season an epic fail? Stop doing this! There are tons of reviews, it touched everyone in a different way according to their mind set.
It touched me with a vibrating push
I believe there has to be something more than just some entertaining entertainment, something that touches you deep down, improves your insight toward life to send your mind into a mission to your own depths to see for yourself that who you are in this world and where is your life escalating to.
Enjoy it, ten stars out of ten. What an emotional rollercoaster. Episode after episode there are moments that hit hard. The characters are so real that you forget they are fictional. The actors aren't acting the characters, they are the character. This is the best TV show ever made and hasn't been surpassed to this day. The Greatest TV Show of All Times.
Absolutely Best Character Ever " Walter White "
I rated this show 10/10
Long Live Breaking Bad Saw my headline? Yeah, that's all I can say. Watch it and enjoy the ride. I can watch the entire series again! From episode 1 of season 1 til the very end, it was such a pleasure :) There's a reason the show is so popular. I was sad when i finished it. From a teacher to the great Heisenberg..BITCH! See what I did there? You'll get it soon enough, just watch it :) I would watch breaking bad 100 times again and won't get bored it's simply a masterpiece ❤❤❤ If Game of thrones wouldn't have ended so incredibly bad it would have been a hard decision. So in the end, Breaking Bad is the best show I've ever seen by far.
Better than any movie aswell.
I just can't describe how well developed the characters and the storyline is.
I was never so addicted to a show and also never felt so much for the characters. It's just amazing to see Walt changing in this whole process.
I really really recommend! I would give 20 if I could. Breaking bad is the best tv series your ever gonna watch ,comedy drama ,action all you want in a show I highly recommend it .
Siriously go watch it before you die . A few weeks ago, if you had told me that BB is better than GOT, I would have probably laughed. Or even thought you are mad. It is funny how perspectives change with time. My long pending desire to watch the show came to an end a month ago. And just yesterday, I completed the entire series.<br/><br/>What a terrific acting performance from the cast. Be it Bryan Cranston or Aaron Paul, Anna Gunn, or Dean Norris. As I am not an expert on acting, I am not going to delve deeper into it.<br/><br/>My favorite part of the series is the storytelling part. Vince Gilligan is a master. he has proven it with this series. from the very beginning to the end of the series, there was not an instance of boredom. For a guy who gets easily bored like me, this was surprising. If you want to know how to write stories for a movie, this show is the academy of it. You can learn flashforward tricks, foreshadowing, and many more such things.<br/><br/>I wouldn't be surprised if 20 years from now, teenagers speak highly about this show. so addictive it is that I feel like I lost something when the show ended. I didn't feel this way even when my favorite show game of thrones ended. Now it is time for me to cope up with the BB hangover. Only one word can define this show "PERFECT". there isn't any other show that we can compare with BrBd. Just a MASTERPIECE. From the very first episode I fell in love with it and the ending is far better than GOT or any other highly rated shows. If you are here for review then you are disrespecting this masterpiece.this show only need love and admiration.
This show is most detailed show of all time.every scene,each frame,each word,each facial expression has its own story.
Each title of this show has also its own story. The nights I stayed up to watch this magnificent show, during the stress of my exams. Breaking Bad just keeps you hooked onto it and can't wait to find out what happens next. it is a slow start, but the build up is extremely worth it so have patience with the show. Bryan Cranston (Walter White), there couldn't have been a better Walter White than him. he has nailed his role to perfection and develops a lot throughout the show. Aaron Paul (Jesse Pinkman) is by far the undisputed best actor of this show, he may not seem as important as Walter, but he too nails his role. The likes of Bob Odenkirk (Saul Goodman), Giancarlo Esposito (Gustavo Fring), Jonathan Banks (Mike Ehrmantraut), Anna Gunn (Skyler White), Dean Jones (Hank Schrader) and RJ Mitte ( Walt Jr.) have also excelled in their position of expertise. THERE WILL NEVER BE A SHOW LIKE BREAKING BAD. EVER. What a show! After a long time of saying that i must start Breaking Bad, I finally finished today and am totally gutted that there's no more to watch!
The story is brilliant with enough twists and turns and "what the hell just happened!" moments to satisfy anyone. The characters are all superbly created and written, especially Walt, who even in his darkest moments I couldn't help but route for. The acting is truly amazing with the 'chemistry' (oh dear) between Cranston and Paul being a real highlight. Its a neo-Western where the bad guys are bad and the good guys are sometimes worse, but because its so well acted, you still love them all!
There is humour, sadness, violence, love and deceit all in perfectly measured doses, which all lead to the simple fact that this is one of the greatest tv shows ever made. Its a sacrilege to not have watched it, one that I've now put right and feel all the better for it. Just watch it! After GOT ends
and the way it ended makes this show the best ever
Vince Gilligan did a fantastic job of representing himself in his show
he created a masterpiece
the flow of the show from the beginning to the end was perfect<br/><br/>and i also wouldn't replace any of the actors in the show with anybody EVER<br/><br/>THANK YOU Man this show is too good. Bryan and Aaron did an incredible job and everything overall is just out of this world. Watch this and your life will instantly be better. Breaking bad is the best serie you can see ever ,It's actions , The drama , the family dramatic moments , how he transformed from a classic chemistry teacher to the best meth maker in the world My wife and I had heard all the hype and talk about Breaking Bad over the years but had never watched a single episode. We finally decided to watch a couple episodes to see if we liked it. 3 weeks later we had finished one of the best series we had ever seen. The writing was excellent as was the acting. We didnt want it to end. Walter White will go down as one of the great characters in the history of television. I just wish we had arrived to the party a little sooner. We didn't know what we were missing! The best series ever hands down. No series even comes close. What more can I say than ... why did this show have to stop ? By far the best show on Netflix. I just couldn't get enough of the show. If you're looking for something to watch then look no future. I have always been a just & fair guy in all my dealings.
I am a really soft spoken person who handles aggrevating situations with a massive smile on my face. London time 8:15am I just realized I haven't left a review for the only show truly worthy of being called a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Let me assure you I am a really hard to please guy so much so it took over 7 years for family & friends to convince me to finally give Breaking Bad a go. When I got to season 5 I turned it off & decided to make some phone calls. I called four friends & two relatives. I told them off big time! Yes thats exactly what happened I said 'whats wrong with you people you said BB was good'. Upon which 3 of them replied 'ye...ya....ye'es?! AND?!' Then they heard the near impossible excitement in my voice. All I said was you guys kept saying its good but you should have used wordings like: best ever, incredible, a masterpiece, life changing, one of a kind, 100/10* etc etc<br/><br/>This show is so good there should be another list here for shows like these. Problem is this will be the only show in that special list as nothing even remotely comes close. And nothing ever will. Start to finish its simply extraordinary. A masterpiece. A stunning work of art.<br/><br/>Everyone should watch it regardless of the genre preference. Trust me you'll be doing yourselves a favour<br/><br/>Perfection on every level. Its madness because I literally struggle to watch many other shows. They just seem to lack what BB had. Perfection<br/><br/>Its not just a tv show its an opportunity. An opportunity to witness the greatest show ever crafted. Absolutely a must see! There's really not much more that can be said. This is the greatest TV show ever made. The writing is pure perfection. The acting, especially by Brian Cranston and Aaron Paul couldn't have been better, but even the other main characters, like Hank, Saul Goodman, and Gus were just phenomenally cast.<br/><br/>What every TV show needs to learn from breaking bad is that you don't need to have over the top dialogue or super emotional acting to create drama. The drama should come from the situation. The audience will pick up how serious or not a situation is through its context. This is where Vince Gilligan's genius comes from. The best show that exists.. Outstanding writing, brilliant direction and a bundle of excellent performances. Bryan Cranston was gobsmaking throughout. Breaking Bad is one of the greatest tv shows ever created! I know people say that about a ton of shows but this is universally thought of as one of the best shows ever. It's at the top of just about every "greatest tv shows ever" list that's out there for a reason...because it is! Every season is terrific and is just as good as the others, which is almost impossible for a show to do but which BB definitely pulls off! I'm speechless after watching all the episodes...hope one day I will erase all breaking bad memory frm my memory and I'm rewaching this It's perfection. Every other show I'll watch, I'll compare with this subconsciously. I only started watching this because the reviews were so high. After the first couple of episodes I thought I'll give it another few weeks. By the end of the first season I was a fan. I've watched this entire story many times over. Never get bored watching it. Simply the best TV show ever made. Chemistry teacher desperate for money cancer paitent Breaks Bad was one of the awesomely wrote TV Series you can ever watch.
Best Writing
Best Acting
Best Cast
Best Direction From season 1 to season 5, Breaking Bad is just perfect all over... Season 4 and 5 are just outstanding! No TV series can ever match the perfection of this show.. mark my words! I cannot find words to tell you all how perfect this show is, but all I can say is that there will be none other that can beat this perfect TV show. Breaking Bad deserves all the hype it gets, Vince Gillian truly delivers to the viewers. You will laugh, cry, and your jaw will be dropped to the floor at how shocking it can get. I get how I'm posting this in 2017, but this show will go down in history for being one of the best shows ever. If you haven't seen it, you NEED to see it right now, I can guarantee you that when you finish the show you will NOT regret it. AND, the 3rd to last episode of the series is the only 10/10 to ever make IMDb, so that should explain itself. WATCH IT! Anyone who says GoT is better than BrBa are living in Delusion. Masterpiece!
The Cast was perfectly chosen.
Awesome Direction and a brilliant storyline
And the Best Ending<br/><br/>My Fav Season:5
My Fav Episode:S5EP14<br/><br/>The Way it turns from a humorous series to a very disturbing one is awesome One of the best series to be ever made for TV. This drama made with a calculated budget unlike game of thrones was never boring. Kudos for the great story by Vince Gilligan. By the time i finished the final episode i am spell bound. The camera work, music, editing and what not - everything worked for breaking bad. Walter played by Bryan Cranston will make you feel for him and at times will even turn you bad. He blurs the line between good and bad. The script is so solid that you can hardly find loopholes in any episode. All your feelings, emotions, attitude are brought to life by this guy. Watch the series to understand what it is to be alive. Don't miss this one. What I so love about "Breaking Bad" is that we know it leaves a legacy. It's not when we see sales skyrocket for a show. Not the Emmy awards. But when we watch a finale that does it the right way (sometimes, it works to do it the wrong way), and it leaves us speechless. It's not only that we are actually satisfied with this series finale, it leaves on that rare high note that other shows cannot seem to catch through their runs. They either stagger, or take a strange road. Only "The Sopranos" knew how to go down the ambiguous road, and it fit perfectly. "Breaking Bad" takes us from good to bad, and the journey is not a straight line. It zigs, it zags. It dings. it explodes. What we have here in the finale goes beyond the ambiguity and finds the spot in hell that each and every character deserves. All "Breaking Bad" has ever done is tick like a time-bomb, and all through "Felina" I could hear that ticking. It takes a second time to appreciate "Felina", and the whole series all-together, because its so dark and deep, the dig continues. Each season is a cakewalk compared to the next. It grows yet dies. "The Sopranos" gave us a playground of deep emotion and a ride into the subconscious. "Breaking Bad" gives us the results of the up and the down without cutting to black beforehand. It cuts right when it needs to, because this is an open and shut story. A story that weaves through all the predictable shows and gives us unbearable suspense, all due to the fact that it can be so unpredictable. It is beautiful, in the darkest of terms. How rarely does the puzzle piece fall into place so masterfully. What an awesome change of pace for Bryan Cranston, who is best known for playing the goofy dimwitted Homer Simpson like dad from Malcom In The Middle(2000-2006). But this character is not goofy or dimwitted. Walter White is your everyday man, who is a high school chemistry teacher, and has a loving wife and handicapped son. On the verge of his 50th birthday party. He begins having a mid life crisis, to make matters worse, he is diagnosed with terminal cancer. But not wanting to leave his family with nothing, in a quick way to make a lot of money. He teams up with a former student named Pinkmam(Aaron Paul) who is now a drug dealer, to make the drug called Crystal Meth. You don't like what Walter is doing, but at the same time you try to understand why he is doing it. I like watching the transformation he is going through, like Mr.Chips turning into Michael Douglas from Falling Down(1993). This series is quite enjoyable, it's a good dramatic series, with some humor moments. Cranstons performance in the show is memorable, and at times heartbreaken to watch. And he and Aaron Paul play off each other so well. I hope it will last a little while. No matter what genre you like.. Ones you start watching it its impossible to stop. Be ready for hangover of lifetime. . . Everything that's brilliant about it has already been said.<br/><br/>For people who previously couldn't decide between this and GoT, well now you know.<br/><br/>For GoT fans who dare rate this 1/10 out of spite and bitterness, SHAME ON YOU.
Did you know that the (incompetent) makers of GoT looked up to Breaking Bad and wanted to have a series finale that's as GOOD as it had?
Well they FAILED miserably.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad is superior.
Brilliant from BEGINNING to END.
And THAT is why it is the BEST. Cast, plot, acting, writing. 10, 10, 10, 10
Vince Gilligan you are a genius!
I watched it twice, the second time I was really able to really appreciate the dark humor. Season four is the best
just watch it please
it is my favorite tv show BREAKING BAD SERIAL IS THE BEST SERIAL FROM EVERY TIME. BRYAN CRANSTON AND AARON PAUL-GREATEST ACTORS IN TV SERIES EVER.BRUHH...THIS SERIAL IS THE BEST!!! I am a very judgemental person when it comes to TV shows and movies, often critiquing them for minor details. I never once did this with Breaking Bad. It has a couple issues but I can say hands down, without a doubt in my opinion, it the best show of all time. It will hook you from the very beginning and you won't be able to stop watching with all the twists and turns the story takes. 100% recommend this show to anyone who hasn't seen it. Awesome work. Clocked it twice now. On the first round though, I didn't enjoy the final Season because the black humor completely disappeared. However on second viewing this didn't bother me so much.<br/><br/>The harmony between concept, casing, acting, writing, directing, design, cinematography, editing, score and sound design are sublime. Great work. Thank you to the author and actors for this great masterpiece I watched breaking bad because my cousin said he couldn't decide what his favourite show was. I obsessed over each detail of the show watching the podcast and the explanation of each episode and making sure to know every detail. It's a puzzle that I thoroughly enjoyed witnessing.<br/><br/>P.S. Watch El Camino & Better Call Saul too. These is called perfection . After got this show is best . Got ruined the ending but this show is great. If anyone in earth had not watch it he had not watch anything . I'm truly spechless For me this series is like "slow and steady wins the race" -and steals the show. The man, Walter=Heisenberg left only ruins and death behind him , but in the end, he had no regret. he died with his baby blue. At the end of the show you will cry. If you haven't seen this yet it's absolute sacralidge that you haven't!... I was hesitant or kept putting it off til I didn't and couldn't stop watching it!... Great actors awesome storyline... Just watch it!...😊 I watched this twice and I want to re-watch it. Fantastic and incredible. One of the series that you have to watch before diying I bet you that no one show anyone watched can match the Awesomeness of this . As I've seen twice . I can say this is one of the best series I've ever seen . Bonding between teacher and student . (Walter white and Jesse Pinkman ) , love between husband and wife ( Hank and Marie ) etc.
This series gives you a hell of experience and surprises. We see all the thing like hiest , gunfight , mastermind and brilliancy . And about writing , the writer write brilliantly . There is not a single scene which is overwhelming . The conclusion is this is If you don't seen it then i highly recommending . Everyone's been telling me to get into Breaking Bad, and finally had time (lots) to see Series 1. If you've not seen BB before prepare yourself for something amazingly unexpected. It's very disturbing from the human angle that death is always just round the corner. But the plot neatly sidesteps this as a minor inconvenience to give us a wonderful characterization a middle-aged man, still with choices in life, when others would've dismissed him as a no-hoper. The story of Walter White, the man who was an innocent and simple person, became a kingpin of his own drug empire. This series is a masterpiece. It took me a while to get used to this kind of show, I remember watching seasons 1 and 2 and telling myself: "is this what this show is all about? Two guys cooking meth?". Once I arrived to season 3 and continued towards the end. I found this series to be a masterpiece created by the maker himself: Vince Gilligan. What I loved so much about the show was the transformation of Walter white to Eisenberg. Some say he became Eisenberg throughout the series but I believe he was always Eisenberg, it was just a matter of time before he reveals his true self. Let's think about it: once gus fring was dead, Walter was basically the new boss. He could have decided to let go of his gob and return to his normal life with his family but decided instead to keep with the work and continue being Eisenberg cause that who he really is. He is a ticking time bomb that waits to be exploded. Eisenberg was always in Walter and now he has taken full control and walt knows he likes being Eisenberg, he likes what he is doing. Bryan Cranston delivers his best performance ever, and a performance that makes him a Hollywood star. Aaron Paul is amazing, great emotional acting. The other actors were fantastic. Both Dean Norris and Giancarlo Esposito are legendary actors who have done amazing work with their characters. Season 5 was absolutely the best cause you get to see how everything collapses around the characters and how they are so vulnerable. So overall were talking about a fantastic series that over the years became a classic show that has many pop culture references and inspired so many with its creativity. And I'm sure it will be remembered for years to come, one day this show will be taught in cinema classes, it has much to offer: cinematography, production, art direction, set decoration and more... Breaking Bad is a masterpiece. No other show has intrigued me so much. Right from the first episode it keeps the viewers addicted to it. Every single character is believable and interesting. Instead of relying on over the top action and flashy visuals, Breaking Bad captures your attention through a fantastic narrative that leaves a deep impact on your mind. It's a must watch.<br/><br/>Also the ending of the show is so beautiful and satisfying. It ties up all loose ends and leaves nothing incomplete. But to see the complete character arc of Jesse Pinkman, I highly recommend watching El Camino after finishing the series. It was definitely a 10/10 and here is why. Because of how Walts character grew from just a chemistry teacher to a Drug Kingpin was the best part about the show and how all the characters fit in perfectly to their roles it was a perfect cast. Season 5 was the best season because of how it wrapped everything up and the ending was perfect Breaking Bad is a neo-western crime drama TV show created by Vince Gilligan. It follows Walter Hartwell White (Bryan Cranston), a chemistry teacher who is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer at the age of 50. Fearing for his family's financial future, he turns to making crystal meth with this former high school student, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) and their descent into the criminal underworld.<br/><br/>Let me tell you. This show is the greatest forms of art in History. It is the best Television show of all time. Breaking Bad is one of those rare creations where everything seems to work. Everything seems to be perfect. The writing, the plot, the acting, editing, direction, cinematography, visual effects and stunts. Of course, Breaking Bad has its cons as well. But they're so astronomically low that nobody ever notices. And its because of this perfection and attention to detail that keeps us hooked and is why we love this show.<br/><br/>The reason a show becomes popular is the audience. When an audience likes something, they want more. The biggest challenge for any TV show runner is to get the audience to come back for more. Vince Gilligan also had to keep the viewers hooked for more. The key to keep the audience come back for more is to create an epic pilot.<br/><br/>The Breaking Bad pilot aired in 2008 on the AMC network. A pilot for any TV show has to create the world, introduce the characters and develop a story. And nobody can do it better than Vince Gilligan. He's like the Christopher Nolan of TV. Vince Gilligan opened the pilot episode with the ending and ended it with the opening. This is kind of relatable to what Quentin Tarantino did in Pulp Fiction. This is what created a spark of interest in the audiences of 2008. They wanted to know what will happen to Walt in the second epiosde because the ending of the pilot had kept them hooked. And then this process just kept repeating itself. The audience's were hooked to the show just like the addicts to meth.<br/><br/>Another reason for the show's success is the character development. Never in the history of Television or even in movies for that fact, have characters changed. You see, Walter doesn't just cook meth and kill people for his family. He also does it for himself. Walter himself is addicted. Not to drugs, but to power. Walter is exceptionally good at what he does and this creates a spark of greed in him. A greed for Power. He realizes what has been missing from his life. Vince Gilligan himself has said : "Walter White when you meet him is someone who is not a criminal and should've been a Criminal. Jesse Pinkman when you meet him is someone who is a criminal and is someone who should've never been a Criminal."<br/><br/>As for Jesse, he slowly realizes that he is not someone made for the criminal world. When Walter can survive is the Criminal world without Jesse, Jesse can't survive without Walter. Because Jesse is innocent. And he cares for all things innocent, like children. And in the criminal underworld, innocent things get squished. And that is wht Jesse feels for them and feels like he can't see them that way. Compare Jesse from Season 1 to El Camino. You can clearly see that its not really the same person. And its the same case for Walter, Skyler, Hank, Marie, Mike, Gus and Saul.<br/><br/>These are just the very few things that make this show great. Everybody who has worked on this show is exceptionally talented. If you have not watched this show, go ahead and do that.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time.<br/><br/>Drake This by far the best TV series of all times and one that will surely never be surpassed. The acting, directing, photography and soundtrack are what should be shown at Film Schools as the ABSOLUTE perfection in their respective categories. The casting team deserves a statue and a holiday in their name. Vince Gilligan shall go down in history as the man who created and scripted the most interesting, unique, true and no BS story EVER. The man is a LEGEND. Breaking Bad is MILES ahead of the second. It is simply the BEST. MUST WATCH! What can i say about Breaking Bad? Pure perfection. Just like Heisenberg's meth. Breaking Bad is unmatchable. Vince Gilligan and the writers are geniuses.
All seasons are untouchable and gold. But my personal favourite would be Season 5.<br/><br/>Characters can't get any better. The acting is magnificent. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul are the perfect duo. Finished BrBa about 2 months ago and i miss it.<br/><br/>The greatest TV Show of all time. For me it's the greatest thing to come out of the film industry. The most dramatic serie i had ever seen. Acting or directing all was awesome for me. I really enjoyed it This series couldn't have been any better. Strong cast, personalities you like then loathe, it has it all. Plus lots of meth! I have seen Breaking Bad 5 times and each time something happens I must have missed.<br/><br/>It's a must watch again before you watch the Breaking Bad movie, El Camino. I compare other series by considering Breaking Bad as benchmarking. If they get close to it, they're good (so far, none was that incredible). At the start you don't know what this series is about but little by little, episode by episode you get more and more involved in the story, feeling sympathy for Walter White, loving the bad guy and hating the good guys, rooting for Walter before you realize you're rooting for the bad guys to win, you see the transformation from this kind, loving and family man to this ruthless, egotistical and manipulative person, who ends up betraying the same people who were the reason he got involved in the drug business in the first place, the introduction of characters like Mike, Lydia, Gustavo Fring were game changers, not many series deserve 10/10 but this one is the closest one. One hell of a show. Excellent ending! Great writing, fantastic performances. Thrilling. I watched this series two times and also the El Camino movie. If the first episodes will make you fall asleep, just give it a chance. In the end, you'll get super addicted to Breaking Bad. A good story with very good actors! Well this is the most detailed show and rewatch is always rewardable.Performances well,Bryan Cranston as Walter White is the best performance on tv ever.personal favourite season is season 5.Just in love with walter's character and the finale was the best finale ever created. It's probably the best series ever directed, written meticulously and executed perfectly. Well you would like to take up flaw in directors work since it is so wisely directed.
A phenomenal work if you really want to watch some real real fantastic stuff. The best part of this series is casting and equal importance given to the each character kind of justice to each and every actor ( I think every one who have watched breaking Bad cannot deny on this) every character has their own unique importance and they might feel proud of being one very essential part of this series. No one is left alone. Breaking Bad a unique name selected breaking a man. Thinking to watch it again. Once you start you can't stop. You can never go wrong with this show! Its so toucing and the way the parts have acted its like they are part our our lives .. its brillant .. cant have a gr8 seriss than this one. Its tremandous The best thing to do is to watch it. You won't regret it. The best tv series I have ever watched. Could watch it over and over again! No series has matched up to this!!! If any TV show has to be given 10/10, it has to be Breaking Bad! Just perfect! Brilliant direction, superb acting and amazing storyline.. Of all the shows I have watched this is the best. Great action and storytelling through out and after all of this to not be disappointed by the ending is a massive bonus nowadays. Best series ever, no doubt. Better than Got and mad men and anything This show grips you till it's very end. One of the only show which keeps getting better with every season.
Every individual growth is showed beautifully. Great Writing, And great performance. The best that I have ever watched in my entire life. Words cannot describe the series. Watch it and won't regret it that's my promise. GREATEST
OF
ALL
TIME......
YOU COULDNT IMAGINE ANY BETTER
MUST WATCH The Best TV show in the last 20 years, every character, plot twist and setting is perfect. Perfectly executed and a timeless classic I guess by watching breaking bad I'm that much more different person. Storyline, directions and actors together made this series uncountable with others ... Where to start....perhaps this is the only tv show which has a repeat value and every time you repeat it grows on you. This has become a benchmark of all tv shows so far. 7 years have gone by after 'Felina' the final episode of season 5, and as on date there is not a single series which has been made which has been loved so much by so many people all over the world. Well GOT came close but they spoiled it all in their last season....<br/><br/>There is however a word of caution, if you plan to watch BB, because once you finish watching, you are not going to like any other series....its so damn perfectly loaded with entertainment value....<br/><br/>And same is the case with Better Call Saul which starts timid but as you start watching season after seasons and reach season 5, you will realise how it is taking you towards BB universe....both the series in Breaking Bad universe are best ever made tv series.....<br/><br/>
To me Rating tv series like Breaking Bad on a 5 point scale or 10 point scale, is not possible or shall I say, perhaps we dont have a scale to rate series like Breaking Bad....it is much more beyond our film/tv rating system.... We see many series now which starts off well then dies in following season, but with Breaking Bad, it just gets better with following season. Bryan Cranston and Aaraon Paul were just brilliant in this.<br/><br/>Thrilling story line, keeping you glued till season 5 without loosing momentum is really commendable. Very well done, Breaking Bad. Slow and steady wins the race. It best fits to this series. Slowly building up the story, only to outburst into the best finishing ever in a TV series. This is the best show that has ever existed nothing can compare to this. Perfect story, perfect cinematography, perfect acting, perfect ending. Once you will finish it you will never be able to find something as good as this. Neither Game of thrones can not compare to it ( and I am a huge fun of Game of thrones too). I guess I'm the latest fan of this series watched 4 season's so far. Amazing casting, screen play and direction. I guess this has been a guiding scale for most of the web Series. Opening and closing of each character was so well defined like old movies nothing was left middle way and I can notice a gradual improvement in quality of the camera skills. I just finished the show, i feel like i miss it already, i mean I've been so obsessed with Mr. White, and Jessi 💔 i can see them in my dream.
And now i finshed the show and m shocked so shocked like i miss someone who i really love, i can't help it i feel so bad. A series much recommended to watch. Found s bit slow at start (personal opinion), but took a lot of my interest till the end. Worth watching! Out of all the shows that came out from 2008 till now this is the best of them all. I was about a decade late to the party when I finally got around to watching this. Daaaamn this show may be the best out there. The wife drove me nuts but you'll have that. The character development and build up of the storyline is amazing and heartbreaking. This is an awesome show and I love every single person involved in it. Worth the time investment Couldn't ask anything better from this...totally in love with this series and I watched at least 3 times. Really good storyline and engaging.. Loved almost every character.. Except skylar.. I just wanted her dead.. Lol. Best show always keeping you at the edge of your seat never gets boring and it gets better and better every season. The benchmark of every TV show I watch. Other shows are either Breaking Bad level or not. WALTER WHITE: "Name one thing in this world that is not negotiable."
ME: Rating Breaking Bad 10/10. Damn I love this series. One of the best show ever watched I mean I got nothing to say. This show is just perfect. It's the best show I've ever watched. What an ending. 10/10 fantastic tv show would highly recommend to watch I have no word to describe the whole series. No one can match up with Breaking Bad. Breaking Bad is the best series I've ever seen. I've watched series like Prison Break, TWD, Sons of Anarchy, Vikings and Suits, but Breaking Bad is definetly the best out of all of them!
The directors of BB was a GENIOUS!
The actors was just unbelievable great!
From the start of the show and till the end, it was all MAGNIFICENT! Both Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul were at their top acting class! They both got Golden Globes and BB did too, which was WELL DESERVED!
Thanks to the producers and the actors for an amazing journey❤ It is really good. All the characters are interesting. Watch it. This show is incredibly written and riveting for five seasons. Every single character is unique and compelling, every storyline is captivating and advances the characters. It delivers an incredible overarching lesson on morality and human nature without ever APPROACHING preachiness or deviating at all from what is true to the shows core. Without question, the greatest show I have ever seen and a true masterpiece. Addictive. Each cast member at his/her best. Creative in every way including the Score and the soundtrack. This series is a work of Art, like Heisenberg's Meth. Hands down best drama tv series ever. If you disagree, you are wrong. Stiry and character arcs are perfect. "BREAKING BAD" is an experience, not a show. You live this series, you don't watch it. I can't say any of the characters' names without an awe-filled "ahh" before them. "Ahh... Walt..." "Ahh... Gus..." and so on. "BREAKING BAD" is transcendent. Best TV series ever watched, Im pretty sure nothing I'll watch from now on Will be as good. PS: I watched this recently again and completed all 5 seasons in 3 days. I guess I need to go get a job I watched Breaking Bad last month for the first time. For years I had heard that it's a great show but somehow I could not bring myself to watch it. So I decided to give it a chance when I saw it on Netflix. And I'm so glad that I did it. Great acting, flawless scenario and implementation of it. I can't imagine how refreshing this was when it first started to air years ago. As many people say here; watch it asap, thank later. This might be the best show I ever seen or maybe it already is. The only disadvantage you may have is that you won't be satisfied with any other TV show. Ever!!! :) But you're already been warned. Breaking Bad is one those TV programmes that is hyped up immensely and yet lives up to all the hype. From the genius of Vince Gilligan to the sublime performances from Bryan Cranston (in particular) and co., this show just manages to get everything right. You will not regret watching it. Around two years ago Walt and Jesse entered into my life and nothin's been same since. That's all I can say. I never wanted to compare GOT and BB But GOT fked up in last season but Breaking Bad was super until the end and that was the most osm part of this series.
I loved Breaking Bad and Walter white Breaking Bad is one of the greatest tv shows ever created! I know a lot of people say that about a ton of shows but this is universally thought of as one of the best ever. It's at the top of just about every "greatest tv shows ever" list that's out there for a reason...because it is! Every season just gets better and better! Oh Vince Gilligan! What have you done?<br/><br/>Why make such a perfect show that after watching this no other show feels the same anymore. How can this be so perfect ?<br/><br/>Instead of starting another TV show I simply keep watching it all over again. Someone help me. Something like 'Breaking Bad' comes only a few times in a lifetime. It fills you up and when it's done you'll be hungry for more despite it having a perfect ending.<br/><br/>If you watch this show and not feel some type of powerful emotion during it, you might as well jump into a coffin now, because you are dead. Nobody can say that game of thrones is better
Just look at season 8
What a joke
Breaking bad WON and will be the most loved show ever First season took off a little slow. It settled up premise, characters, the mood of the show, its world, if you will. It has some great moments though, like body disposal scene from the second episode which made me choke on my own laughing tears. <br/><br/>Second season blew me away. Completely. Right from the very beginning. Second episode Grilled along with sixth episode Peekaboo,being so damn hilarious, bizarre and gripping, I'm sure, will fill find their places in the TV's Hall of Fame, trust me. <br/><br/>What third season will bring, has yet to be determined.<br/><br/>The show has quality to surprise. At first I was a bit skeptical toward it: A school teacher turns to be a drug dealer? Yea' I've heard something similar is already on TV, and I wasn't excited. So if creator of the show appeared to be someone else than Vince Gilligan (who made earlier in his career significant contribution to development of another great show "The X-Files") and if the show was on channel different than AMC or HBO, I even doubt I'd give it a chance. By the way, the pilot was shot with intention to be sold directly to HBO, that's why it later was edited for nudity and explicit language by AMC, which still is a cable channel, but apparently trying to remain more "family friendly."<br/><br/>"Breaking Bad" could be ridiculously funny and hellishly creepy, it contains some rough images and topics, not to mention that it's filmed astoundingly, unbelievably beautiful. Juxtaposition of plots, characters, places, even colors and sounds provides unique installments which had me on the edge of my seat, shaking with laughters and shivering with excitement and aesthetic delight.<br/><br/>Show's overdramatization brings us to the part which I praise the most: Style. It's kind of style that first puts before our eyes some quite clichÃ©d soap-like picture: Common middle-America family consisting of middle-aged Chemistry high school teacher, his pregnant wife, and their cerebral-palsy-inflicted teenaged son. Then chain of circumstances invokes some highly absurd and eerie, often impossibly funny, unbearably scary and hopelessly sad situations. It's the kind of style you may find in 50's noir films, in pictures of French nouvelle vague, in characters of movies by Quentin Tarantino, the Cohen brothers and Robert Rodriguez. <br/><br/>In spite of the vortex of intense and dangerous situations the show manages to carry throughout all its episodes some unexplainable vibe of incredible, Buddhism-like calmness. As if we were told some sort of ancient myth or fable. Of course it has a lot to do with sophisticated work of cinematographers and subtle inputs of art designers. Although I usually prefer dark, foggy, shadowy â€“ could be said depressing â€“ cinematographic atmosphere ("Twin Peaks," "the X-Files," Millennium," "the Sopranos"), I found myself amazed by crystal clear images of "Breaking Bad." Insignificant and empty on the surface, yet filled with dimness and despair; New Mexican sun that doesn't burn you, it gives chills and almost numbs you in the end.<br/><br/>I'm not going to say anything about lead actor Bryan Cranston. His character doesn't speak that much either, it's all written on his face. Aaron Paul's character, on the other hand, has some mouth on him, but don't let him disencourage yourself, yo biach. Their intentions are good, in different ways. But you know the road to hell is paved with what, aren't you?<br/><br/>All of the above combines in highly unorthodox, exceedingly entertaining and fairly thought-provoking top-notch TV-show third season of which premiÃ¨red March 21st on AMC or wherever you may or willing to get it. the BEST TV DRAMA SERIES of ALL TIME Breaking Bad After so many lugubrious turns, "Breaking Bad" came to an end on Sunday on an almost uplifting note.<br/><br/>Running since 2008..5 Glorious SEASONS & 62 clinching EPISODES & rating of 9.5/10 on IMDb & 99/100 on Metacritic it ended with the MOST SATISFYING FinalE ever..Watched by 10.3 million viewers.<br/><br/>A simple story of a chemistry teacher making blue meth for providing his family with his former student teaches us every important meaning of LIFE.With very REAL/GREAT/EXTRAORDINARY performance by Bryan Cranston & created by Vince Gilligan this TV Series blowned my MIND..totally.<br/><br/>I have watched so many Great English TV Series like The Walking Dead, Modern Family, The Big Bang Theory, Supernatural, Firefly & Sherlock also but this was PURE GENIUS.All Hail The King HEISENBERG!!! If you watch this show you will not be entertained by any other show on this earth ðŸ˜† Rewatched it many times, now I've lost the count and I never get tired of watching it.
Definitely the best series I've ever seen, in my opinion. Great characters,great plot, great storytelling, even great soundtracks. Everything is beautifully connected.

I love it! PERFECT<br/><br/>Season 1: 8

Season 5: 10
perfection at its finest. so smart. so amazing. best show ever. also season 4 is a 10 but for some dumb reason RT doesn't have a page for season 4 smh worst website ever (first half - 3 viewings, second half - 2 viewings) The greatest peice of television ever created and I think that says alot about this show. 'Breaking Bad' is one of the most popular rated shows on IMDb, is one of those rarities where every season has either been very positively received or near-universally acclaimed critically and where all of my friends have said nothing but great things about.<br/><br/>Very few shows in recent memory had me so hooked from the very start that before the week was over the whole show had been watched, especially when for a lot of shows now airing watching one episode all the way through can be an endeavour. 'Breaking Bad' had that effect on me, and its reputation as one of the best, consistently brilliant and most addictive shows in many years (maybe even ever) is more than deserved in my eyes. Its weakest season is perhaps the first season, understandable as any show's first season is the one where things are still settling.<br/><br/>Actually everything is established remarkably from the very start, but once the writing and characterisation becomes even meatier the show reaches even higher levels.<br/><br/>Visually, 'Breaking Bad' is one of those shows that is both stylish and beautiful, with photography and editing that are cinematic quality and put a lot of films today to shame, where there are a lot of visually beautiful ones but also some painfully amateurish looking ones. The music always has the appropriate mood, never too intrusive, never too muted.<br/><br/>The writing for 'Breaking Bad' is a fine example to all shows of how to have a lot of style but also to have a lot of substance. The dialogue throughout is thought-provoking and tense, while also have a darkly wicked sense of humour and heart-tugging pathos. The stories are texturally rich, intimate, tense and layered, with the pace of them consistently deliberate but taut. The direction couldn't be better.<br/><br/>Can't say anything bad about the acting. Bryan Cranston is phenomenal as one of the most fascinating anti-heroes, or even of any kind of character, in either film or television. Aaron Paul has never been better and Anna Gunn is affecting. The characters are compelling in their realism.<br/><br/>Overall, describing it as brilliant doesn't do 'Breaking Bad' justice. 10/10 Bethany Cox Breaking Bad is the greatest show of all time but please, just don't let your toxic brain ruined this platform. How pathetic all of you to praised this show and rated Game of Thrones 1 just because you didn't have the finale you want before. I never watched any series like this . Each character is a epic . The one awesome thing you have understand is that it's like real life story runs in mind of alll time , no unrealistic , illogical ploy . Oh god , sometime episodes stunningly superb. Breaking Bad is absolutely one of the greatest tv shows ever created! I know people say that about a lot of different shows but this really is universally thought of as one of the best shows ever. It's at the top of just about every "greatest show ever" list there is for a reason... because it is! All you have to do is read through the reviews/ratings and see how loved this show really is! Every season is terrific and just as good as the others, which is almost impossible for a show to do but which Breaking Bad definitely pulls off! If you haven't seen it yet then go watch it, if you have seen it then go watch it again! Best TV show ever. Simples<br/><br/>And better call saul is different and nearly as good. In the beginning I would like to say thanks to the terrible crew of this great work, beautiful idea, good actors, director and writer all were distinguished, this great sad and happy work was really great, actor Brian Cranston with the character Walter White and Heisenberg great schizophrenia and professional reincarnation of the two characters worthy of praise and also the actor Aaron Paul with the personality of Jesse Pinkman, the compassionate addict and the way he kept up with life, who did not watch this series. I tell him what are you waiting for, an integrated series in all respects, all the staff. I congratulate them on this beautiful work. Thank you .. This is the best show ever! If you watch this show it will change you! White is such a turd.<br/><br/>And i never saw before how outrageously immoral this show is on its s*xing up of the disgusting thing that meth is, the misery. One day we will have evolved enough to just say no to this sort of hypocritical junk like we re starting to say no to the glorification of colonial racist subjugation in symbols and entertainment. Its just a matter of time. Im giving it 10/10 for the opportunity it offers to force us to THINK. BEST, only one word for the show.

... This is my first ever review in IMDB. It is such a great show and I forced myself to write this review. Never miss to watch this show. Get yourself a treat. Thanks Vince Gillian for giving us this old gold tv show I love you and I love all the casts in this series good luck in the next time you making a new gold story Walter H. White is a chemistry genius, but works as a chemistry teacher in an Albequerque, New Mexico high school. His life drastically changes when he's diagnosed with stage III terminal lung cancer, and given a short amount of time left to live: a mere matter of months. To ensure his handicapped son and his pregnant wife have a financial future, Walt uses his chemistry background to create and sell the world's finest crystal methamphetamine. To sell his signature "blue meth," he teams up with Jesse Pinkman, a former student of his. The meth makes them very rich very quickly, but it attracts the attention of his DEA brother in law Hank. As Walt and Jesse's status in the drug world escalates, Walt becomes a dangerous criminal and Jesse becomes a hot-headed salesman. Hank is always hot on his tail, and it forces Walt to come up with new ways to cover his tracks. Hands down the best show of all time. It's just flawless. Bryan cranston gives a mind blowing performance.<br/><br/>(Do not Watch This show) The best series in the world .. good actors good events Exceptional show, you will fall in love with each and every character. MUST WATCH GO FOR IT. The best that I have watched. Am said because there is no second season and Walter death. The best series i watch ever ossssm i really want to watch it again
i cryer in some episodes
tge the cast is very good In the process of protecting family.
A human can turn to animal.
Its only in the "Breaking Bad" where you will find the truly mesmerizing writing of a characters.
You will love mr.white at the same time you will hate him in the process but in his shoes everyone would have done the same.
You gonna cry with Jesse pinkman, you will cry for him, and you will love his loyalty you will gonna love him. Looking at the second pass, I found that there are so many details, and many links are also somewhat ironic because they echo the later plot. White and pink, I still seem to like it now. No matter from which point of view, the "Poison Master" is worthy of the divine drama. Cancer has locked the final countdown to his life, but he has lived out of it. To some extent, it was cancer that brought him back to life. After "I am awake", it was an empire that the audience and himself never imagined.Break the law and break the old framework to do crazy things that a dull person would not do. However, these things are just to continue the middle class life of the family after death. The rules, obligations and responsibilities are still deep in the bone marrow. How can we be a person who lives for ourselves, or how can we live? Never watch a show like this .. if you watch this you'll get a feel if 10 9plus rated movie .. you'll be in hangover Atleast of one month .. I assure guarantee..<br/><br/>All the characters remains in your memory forever<br/><br/>Breaking bad number 1 One of the best shows - I have been binge watching I just finished watching Breaking bad a while ago and it was seriously "The Best Television Show Ever!". I was hooked Season 1 Episode 1 all the way to Season 5 Episode 16 and I'm still a loss for words. Everyone Must See This! Everything about BB is almost perfect.The plot,the actors,the direction,music you name it.Oh and the attention to detail is on a whole another level.The way each and every scene is shot, the camerawork, it's a treat.I was rather skeptical about the way they would end it but they did a pretty good job there too not leaving almost anything unattended.My favourite character, which would surprise a lot of people is Saul Goodman which is played by Bob Odenkirk.I wish I could see him till the last minute of the last episode but anyway they made another show based completely on that character which I'm gonna see next.But most importantly this show has the potential to almost change your outlook towards life.It leaves a deep impact on your brain it's unbelievable.Almost every major character in the show leaves a vibe on you.I mean to say that if now I see Bryan Cranston in another movie or show I won't see Bryan Cranston, it's only Walter White that I will see.Likewise for all the others.So yeah if you haven't seen the best tv show of all time go treat yourself. Vince Gilligan is a genius. The story telling is just awesome. The direction is just perfect with Bryan's contribution to it. No matter how many movies or series I watch, nothing can replace Breaking Bad. The background story, the character arcs; hats off. 👏 That's how you tell a story and end as well. I hear people saying that it's a slow story. I don't know how can they think this way. I think the story telling of Vince is a gift from God. The way he focuses on every detail is an art. I mean, how can you love or hate a character if you don't pay attention to details. How can you think it's slow and boring! Better call Saul is another must watch show for breaking bad lovers. Another masterpiece. ❤ This first season are very slow but intersting at every season there will be thrillng at the end it will say''Die with memories'' not ''with dreams'' Sometimes the word i used in subject are less is in using. This is what we says the content has. Content, actor,acting, direction, plot everything is perfect, awesome , best Breaking bad is the best TV show ever created. EVER. However, this show wouldn't have achieved the same praise and acclaim that it has if it wasn't for 2 words: Bryan Cranston. The acting brought by him is a masterclass in emotion, facial expressions, range, and much more.
Everyone in this cast gave it their all and that is shown throughout the 5 seasons. Not one single performance from the main or the secondary characters is badly done.
The writing on this show is also second to none. The way that it methodically and carefully plots the story is impeccable. The camerawork is beautiful. The performances are world class. The writing is top notch. It doesn't get any better than Breaking Bad Madness Overloaded... Fallen in Love with Meth Characters..... Truly Breaking bad (2013)

Crime/Substance/Violence/Nudity<br/><br/>Who wouldn't love a perfect series to roll their mood to a whole new genre during this quarantine? Lucky for you this is the right one!....Breaking bad is a crime TV series that was created by Vince Gilligan. This one was an instant hit and won multiple awards in its time. It still is one of the best TV series till date and isn't at top of imbd for no reason all those little detail the series focuses on makes it more interesting to watch. The main cast such as Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul and Anna Gunn have excellently played their characters. Diagnosed with cancer, a high school chemistry teacher teams up with a high school drop out and starts cooking and selling methamphetamine to provide for his family. This led to them facing a lot of obstacle in their path but still with their hardwork and everything they go through all these!! When it end you wish to watch more secseon due to Emotionally related with it .. it's greaaat If you have the ability to prove that you are a genius and make your favorite people have a wonderful life, but the law says that your ability is against the law and you are not allowed to use it, then one day when you are dying of cancer, you will not use your genius? Best movie best cast everything is absolutely perfect It was quite boring from the start. I began enjoying it from the second season. It was really improved from season two. Great movie. The Greatest show ever filmed by camera!! it'll makes u laugh, cry, angry,love.etc.
no other justified Walter white role like Bryan cranston did.. i wish that show must go on and on and on. Nothing is better than this best show seen in my life . Grater than anything. Once you start you won't be able to stop bindge watching day after day so be sure to first free up your schedule for sometime..Enjoy the meth ride ;) The actual name of our bisexual pro-taginist is jim pickens but they had to change it cause they were being sued by Kevin O'Reily also known as CallMeKevin online
the 2,370,000 subscribers Exceptional writing. Storylines were great. Characters were badass. Best show ever!<br/><br/>Exceptional is an understatement. Just watch Better Call Saul and you will understand the details and the thought process that the creators and writers go into. Masterpiece show if you have patience than you'll surely like it . The real master ming mr white! I rushed home every day from work just to watch breaking bad. No matter how many times I re-watch the series, the novelty doesn't wear off. Watching this show is a once in a lifetime experience. What more needs to be said? A must watch for everyone. Just watched the complete show in 2020 maybe i am idiot to watch it too late now i am completely running out of tears watching the end walterwhite aka bryan cranston you are a gem man thriller aaron paul you too exceptional plot masterpiece my fav series of all time truely no level can match him plzz watch it The best series i have ever seen ... every episode of seasons is awesome not negotiable... Best TV Series ever, not even close. The cinematography, the character development and musical score are really top-notch! Breaking Bad is the best show I have ever watched in my life! The storyline, the characters and the climax, everything was on another level and truly epic! This is the first show I've watched without any interruptions and what a show! Madness! I'm a fan! At first, I didn't want to watch it and all. Then, I got persuaded to watch it. After a couple of episodes, I started to like it. It had comedies, songs, some actions, cool scenes, etc.
Definitely worth the watch! I sometimes feel like I should have watched Better Call Saul first since the timeline is different and all. Then again, it doesn't matter because both Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul are good and funny!
Check them out! The whole experience is worth watching , also watch BETTER CALL SAUL & EL CAMINO Amazing show, I think the world will never do similar series ever. Thanks best crew Just one word speechless to sum it up...I can definitely say it is the BEST SERIES EVER MADE...just watch it and believe me you will have the same thought after you are done with the last episode...execution and climax...and everything in between is simply unmatchable....wow...amazing series...come on every creative people out there ...if you want to define content. Then Breaking bad is the answer for that At times this show made me so nervous I wanted to be swollen by my couch but I could never turn off the tv. It's so good! Series starts off a bit slowly , But if you watch it with patience you will feel the real essence of BREAKING BAD . The first 3 seasons are not that good but the 4 and most importantly the fifth season are the greatest in television history I belong to that group which left the series on Season 2 and came back to watch it. I binged watched this in a week as I couldn't take mind off the series. The writing and Bryan Cranston as Walter White/Heisenberg are beyond words. I have never seen a series like this which gets better with each season. Whatever you expect never happens which is the best thing about this show. This makes the characters natural and don't seem to follow a script. If you haven't watched this please please do. From the first scene to the last not ever it bores you or makes you yawn or make u loom elsewhere.... One of the very few shows that relies on the story for its success rather then nudity... This is definitely once in. Lifetime show and you should not miss a chance to watch it. The best movie I ever seen, and I have seen everything There is nothing that makes me feel better than re-watching these series. It's a master class. An outstanding writing and cinematography. Brilliant characters. Unstoppable story moving over and over.<br/><br/>You will get crazy after it's end because your life will never be the same. You will never experience this type of tv show anymore. The best drama series of All Time. Honestly, this should be at overall 10 and doesn't deserve 9.4 at all.
If you have not watch this yet, its a lost. Please do watch it. Netflix still has this in their app. Say best tv series name
breaking bad
you are godammn right. Such amazing screenplay and acting. Flawless in every aspect Most TV series exist in a state of enforced stasis, minor changes to the status quo and a character death here and there keep might keep things fresh but ultimately as a viewer you might watch them on an episode to episode basis without thinking too far ahead. There are however a select few series which have set out trying to tell a complete unified story in which every event has a bearing on the overall picture of the tale, and everything from episode one to the finale might feel planned. I'd include Game of thrones, Mr Robot, The Americans etc. in this category. This means that you get this sense of falling further and further down the rabbit hole as you watch each episode. For creators, this is the hardest thing to pull off, it must take incredible discipline and patience. To this day I'd argue that there's only one TV series that has achieved this huge novelistic structure without losing momentum or going astray at some point in its long run. I am of course talking about Breaking Bad. From the first episode Breaking Bad knows what it's about and from there on it unfolds like a great big pulpy novel. Each season doesn't end in a finale which wraps things up only for the story to have to find a new beginning in it's next outing, but instead ends with just an episode (Invariably an incredible one) that raises the stakes for the next season and subtlety moves the story into the next act in a way that feels natural. There's a beginning, a middle and an end. And the protagonist's arc is clearly sign posted all the way through to the story's astounding, devastating final act.<br/><br/>When you reach the end of Breaking Bad you feel as though you've completed a long journey in the best way possible. Few series (or even movies for that matter) can match it for being just so stuffed with artistic craft. Everything is just tip top from the writing to the acting. Even while the visuals may not be able to match some of the bigger budget blockbuster series like game of thrones or Westworld for shear spectacle, they are instead meticulous in their creativity in a way those other series don't quite match. We're treated to beautiful wide angle shots of an omnipresent New Mexico desert, but also with close ups of little details most showrunners would simply ignore. Attention to these details is perhaps the thing which makes breaking bad so compelling. I personally always loved the look of the show for its grainy, high contrast, natural lighting style of cinematography. It's notably shot on film in a world increasingly turning to the clear look of digital. This all (alongside directing which is always imaginative) helps to bring out a wild western pulpy quality reminiscent of the work of Leone or Tarantino.<br/><br/>There a few series I hold closer to my heart than all the rest (The Leftovers, The Sopranos, Twin Peaks, Mad Men etc.), but still, 7 years after I finished Breaking Bad, it remains my ultimate TV experience and the only series I've seen that never put so much as a foot wrong over its 5 season run. I recommend giving it the most cinematic viewing you can. Find a big screen with a good sound system and settle in for a rare top to bottom TV masterpiece. This review could go on for ever and ever. Not only would I not change a single second of Breaking Bad, but, I can say without question that I will never, ever watch anything that comes close to it. Perfection, legend, words that are way over used. But yet these words mean nothing when describing Breaking Bad! Simply the best there ever was and ever will be. Story = 10/10<br/><br/>Characters = 10/10<br/><br/>Cinematography = 10/10<br/><br/>Editing = 10/10<br/><br/>Soundtracks = 10/10<br/><br/>Everything just felt like a good dream. Story and screenplay is good. All lead actors did they job. If I really have to be picky then Anna Gunn could have done little better. Bryan & Aaron needs to be called out for making their character believable. One of the best, most complete shows that only gets better as it goes on. Nothing better. Watched approx 6 times. Will watch again. After completing this u will realise tht u just lived a life. This show gets even better on second viewing. Prove me wrong. If you watch this you will never enjoy other series again. Its the best ever I liked the show, though I rushed it.. Still it rockzz Every single character shines through out the five seasons ! Loved every bit of especially the last 3 seasons were so intense !! Simply could be the best thing I've ever seen. Even I could imagine that existed, I wouldn't imagine that much. I don't know how I was mature when this was released and I didn't watch it. Thanks a lot Breaking Bad. Not joking!! Best show i have ever watched!!! Binged all 5 seasons and the movie El Camino in two weeks!!! After you watch this show, you won't be able to watch any other show without being disappointed. No other show compares! This show a life changing show to me, i am more like movie watcher, but it changed my vision towards tv shows. One of the best learning happens in my filmmaking career. This is the most thought out show I have ever watched. Every single character is 100% necessary; every character has so much depth and so many layers of personality. They left it at 5 seasons for a good reason, to give it's viewers short and sweet QUALITY entertainment. Breaking bad is the best TV show ever. The writing is very good unlike other TV shows that recently ended I can not describe how i felt sad when it ends. Vince Gilligan is a genius. I've never seen such talented actors like Aaron Paul & Bryan Cranston. Suggest you see. The best TV show of all time, starting from the first season and how WW has changed his character to be a monster, what a masterpiece TV show.
The best of all time The greatest show ever created. Perfection in every detail. It's an experience of great cinematographic art and character development. The intensity and drama will ensnare you. Yet the black comedy will make you laugh. This show is all it could be and will stand in history as one of the most amazing TV-series ever made.<br/><br/>And the cast... Never forget the cast. Every actor and actress fills their parts with great success! With the great Bryan Cranston in the role of his life.<br/><br/>The show was perfect, all bad things must come to an end. And what an end.<br/><br/>I bow humbly I was purely amazed by how good this can be, who needs meth when watching Breaking Bad is so addictive, it is absolutely perfect from the first to last episode. I'm in my fifties and have watched enough television programs and movies that nearly every fictional story I see is repetitively and transparently predictable. I know how it's going to turn out before the halfway point, because Hollywood just keeps regurgitating the same story lines and scripts ad nauseam. But when I watch Breaking Bad, I find virtually ZERO predictability. I am completely locked-in through every episode because the plot always manages to deviate from the expected. And yet it does so, for the most part, without seriously challenging rational beliefs. I think this show is an absolute masterpiece, and the kind of gem that is too rarely encountered in the garbage-filled thousand-channel morass that is television today. Breaking Bad should be considered the absolute benchmark for serial dramatic programming. Well, I have seen about 50 series in my life. proly 10-15 out of them are just garbage, about 20 are good, and the others are very good(like true detective,sherlock). Only ONE is on another level, like others are on earth and it is in the sky with clouds. Of course its BrBa. Only series that is closer is The Sopranos(in fact, only thing I don't like is that it's too stretched). This one is like father or grandfather of BrBa. But there is only one KING. This is it. This is the peak of television, nay, this is the peak of the entire film industry. Never will there be anything like Breaking Bad on the screen ever again. It is to this day, and always will be, the best Tv-series of all time.<br/><br/>I could go into detail about all the things that are good with this show, but I fear then this review would be endless. But the most astonishing thing about Breaking Bad is its attention to detail. The creators, writers, and directors are pure geniuses, how they can even come up with all these impregnated details and foreshadowings is beyond me. As astonishing is the acting, from Giancarlo Esposito and Byran Cranston to Aaron Paul and Anna Gunn, every single performance is spot on, and Cranston's is out of this world - more than deservedly winning him 4 Emmy's and a Golden Globe.<br/><br/>To spot flaws in this series, one would need an electron microscope. I'm not even sure then if you could find any. It is like the Mona Lisa of Tv - infact, the Louvre should replace her with a painting of Walter White. Flawless, absolutely flawless, I cannot put into words how good this show is.<br/><br/>Everyone who hasn't seen this, must see it before they die.
Everyone who has seen it - watch it again. No, it's not Game of Thrones, it's not the Walking Dead, it's not Sopranos, not the West Wing. Truthfully, I think Band of Brothers is probably no.1 but Breaking Bad ties BoB for first place. <br/><br/>The story, the pacing, the script, the direction, the acting, the plot, the setting; everything is flawless. <br/><br/>By this time, you're already sick of people spoiling you about it and all that's left to do is just watch it. Just watch it. <br/><br/>P.S. My favourite season is the fourth season. I'm going to keep this short and concise.. Breaking Bad is the epitome of perfection, a radiant show with just about no flaws. Bryan Cranston's portrayal and development of Walter White is phenomenal; Aaron Paul's performance - impeccable. Some of the other stars of the show aren't as amazing as these two, but they manage to sync into their roles throughout the seasons. The chemistry of the actors in the series is beyond realism, and so this series earns a definite 10 star vote. <br/><br/>The only thing I am afraid of, is that no other series will ever quite keep me on the edge of my seat as Breaking Bad. I will be highly disappointed when this show ends. That is all. The whole series has been a pleasure to race through. One of the most impressive aspects of this series are the character development and story. Jesse pinkman starts off as a junkie and continues to be one for a while, but later on he genuinely becomes a thinker and turns his life around.<br/><br/>The superior was of the last episodes are hard to beat, and no other series has done it. Certainly the overjoyed GoT fiasco. Every person on earth should watch this TV show. If life didn't teach you a lesson, this TV show will. It's so beautiful and so amazing I just can't put it into words, I feel like I can rewatch it thousand times and not get bored of it. Everything is just awesome! Without any Bigbudget making how this come top on rating because the script was outstanding...i was thinking how GOT ends as pathetic and brba ending was the exact opposite...the best show ever..if you are watched it no other series will stand with this.. Gustavo Fring is an example of a disciplined man focused only on his goals. When the greatnesses becomes series you will find breaking bad the best series ever the best characters , best director , best representation , best story and best end . Best!! So much real content and no exaggeration in events...love it! Prison Break and GOT is a joke compared to this one. It had everything: Insane acting, Great story, Killing, brutal scenes, you name it. It was so addicting I couldnt stop watch it! I almost never ate or slept! I re-watched it once and it was just as good as the first time! actually I could re-watch it 10 times more if I had the time. 2008 what a great year! Simply put in three words: Apex, unprecedented & unparalleled. The only one sharing the throne with Bbad in this genre is The Sopranos. I could go on forever and give you plenty of reasons why but there is no time to waist on talk here. Just watch it and tell me I'm wrong, it won't change the reality of the situation. This show is in my top 5 best series of all time. Enjoy! (Or not... ;) If you asked me prior to April 2019 to pit the two most critically acclaimed TV series against each other - as fair or unfair as it is based on the fact that they are two completely different shows, but if you boiled it down to the basics I would've told you that Game of Thrones was ever-so-slightly better than Breaking Bad...the former has some complexities and "holy *four letter word*" moments that are just unmatched by anything I've ever watched. And I may be one of the few that did not mind the last season of GoT and it's resolution, but also agree with the masses in the decline in quality and nuance (what both shows are notorious for) of GoT's last season, couple with a fair amount of wasted potential and forgone character development in the last season. I think we all are guilty of coming up with our own intermediate/extended scenes in our minds to satisfy or complement what we saw on the actual TV screen.<br/><br/>Thus, now that both shows are done the real winner is very apparent: Breaking Bad emerges victorious from the battle.<br/><br/>From start to finish, BB is as close to perfection as any piece of media can get. Everyone knows the story, but I will never forget how absolutely intense, stunning, and at times anxiety-inducing the experience of watching this show was (I binged it very shortly after the finale since everyone was absolutely freaking out about how good it was). It balances every character and everything good about the crime/drama genre coupled with an amazingly unique premise that almost demands tension at any given moment.<br/><br/>Acting...directing...cinematography...editing... and above all, writing...all literally 100% on point, all the time. Including the resolution/finale. No wishing for something different or character arc ambiguity. It was sensical, shocking, and satisfactory to the highest degree.<br/><br/>Both GoT and BB have raised the bar for TV that was already elevated by shows like The Sopranos and The Wire. Some current ones are close (check out Barry for some awesome and unique black comedy, and clearly takes some cues from BB) but will be hard pressed to find something as magical as Breaking Bad - the closest we will get is its counterpart show Better Call Saul, which is also damn near perfect (come or with Season 5 already, dammit!)<br/><br/>Go Team Gilligan - I am waiting for your next project! After rewatching this series with a friend, the first season comes across as very dull with a low budget. It's slow and meandering and my friend had a hard time maintaining interest. The second season gets better and by season 3 and 4 it's become bingeable with us watching several shows back to back.
The ending could have been written a few different ways and it has a nice finish as shown.
El Camino is the follow up movie and mostly just extends the show with attempts to wrap a few things up. Best webseries with twists and Turns only in season 4 few episodes become boring due to its length some of the episodes can be excluded otherwise a perfect series. .I can't explain what exactly feels after finishing last episode Everything about this show is just so perfect! You get hooked to the show right from the first episode and it keeps you on the edge of your seat till the finale.
All the characters are well written and impeccably portrayed by the actors! Direction and cinematography is top notch. All in all this a kind of show which will stay with you for a long time. A very worthy contender for the greatest TV show of all time. Has there ever been a story so unique, so compelling and so well-developed? Not only do we have breathtaking drama, there is also a touch of dark humour that gives the show an extra dimension. Breaking Bad is completely devoid of cheesiness and predictability but never falls prey to pretentious artsiness.<br/><br/>And then there is the acting. Bryan Cranston's performance is staggering and the character development of Walter White is possibly unmatched in television history. Aaron Paul, Dean Norris and Giancarlo Esposito are also just ridiculously good.<br/><br/>I truly feel sorry for every other televison show as they are pretty much all left in the dust by this masterpiece. Not gonna say a lot, but this series ends right at the golden spot. Sometimes shows have one or two too many seasons. Not this one. This show will make you say, "oh just one more!" and then soon enough it's been 5 hours. An amazing series through and through. All I have to say WOW,I gonna watch this TV serous for the second time,
Science,Family,Love,Money,Thug Life all in one Best screenplay by Vince Gilligan,Great writing and moved performance by all the cast and crew This is simply the greatest show. I rewatched it all 3 times allready, it's incredible. I heard a lot about Breaking Bad series and I didn't think it was so amazing until after I saw it, then Wow, I got attached to the characters of the series from Mr. White and Jesse to the smallest and least visible character, all the characters attracted, Walter's journey from an ordinary miserable teacher to reach The great Heisenberg is incredible, all the characters are perfect, I do not think that I will see a work with this perfection at all, the perfect end in which this series succeeded, that ended at the top and without extension and unnecessary prolongation, and ended up at the top.<br/><br/>'To W.W. My star, my perfect silence. ' W.W.<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>Hasan Alsari - Bahrain Rewatched it after it ended a few years back. I remembered the plot, I remembered that I enjoyed it. But I forgot the subtle nuances and it made it more enjoyable the second time around. Best watched during this lockdown. The ending of Niubi proves that the play is an insurmountable drama. When Mr White finally admitted, "everything is for himself." It has exposed the hypocrisy of the family thought that the United States has always advocated, and slapped those hypocritical mainstream dramas loudly. Human nature is selfish. Best ever Tv series/show Globe..... One of the best tv series i have ever watched.
Easily top of my list.
The most engrossing show you will probably ever watch. Bryan Cranston (Walter White) and Aaron Paul (Jesse Pinkman) are incredible together. Giancarlo Esposito (Gus Fring) character and performance is so incredibly powerful and cold every time he comes on screen your on edge. Breaking Bad is one of the great TV shows of our generation. It offers a compelling concept mixed with incredible characters that are layered beyond comprehension. With excellent music, cinematography and atmosphere, this show cements itself as being worth its praise. The best series in history, with a sequence of events, with the art of dialogues and realism It is a masterpiece, each character is also meticulous.
TV series a man wants to watch in his life. Really the best show I am sorry for not having more seasons I have watched a number of series. Breaking bad is above them all. Bryan Cranston performance in the serie was the best in his career. Hat off. Breaking bad is a Great TV show 10/10. One of the best TV. Niether one tv show wont get even close to this one.
Thank you for this masterpiece!! Watching it 3rd time The best I have ever watch... if you are a tv show watcher you have to watch this Masterpiece before you Die.. No Words.. W.W & Jesse ❤❤❤ The best ever tv series i had ever seen in my life. The plot, the acting, the sound mixing, the cast everything is damn perfect.
Every action has an equal an opposite reaction i had seen. The life of a high school chemistry teacher tells us a lot of thing that a man can do everything, he became a teacher, he became a drug mafia, he became a family man.
The acting of Bryan Cranston and Aron Paul is awesome. The series has 5 seasons plotting with his all life how time can change humans life. How problems came in your life and change everything. This show is fantastic. Nothing superficial or supernatural, just a good story. I loved The Wire on HBO and GOT and West Wing was solid, but none of them are as good as BB. Still a great show after many years. This is the best show that has ever been written. It's beautifully shot, beautifully acted and fantastically put together. Only watch this show if you are ready to get sucked in. This show is one of the best cinematographic shows ever made. The visuals are on another level. The content and story writing keeps you guessing and EVERY DETAIL MATTERS. You could rewatch this show over and over and you would see so many hints that are dropped throughout the TV series. Amazing! I am still waiting for the same perfections of all including emotions darama acting direction storyline character building...can somebody have potential to beat this masterpeace not even GOT which spoil it's last season big time....so my is wait still on.... Episode after episode, season after season, Breaking Bad continues to improve, one of the most common problems in tv shows is that it loses its essence and quality with the passage of time, GoT, Sons of Anarchy, The Walking Dead and Other shows have suffered from this problem, you can rest assured that Breaking Bad at no time becomes boring or incoherent, and this is partly thanks to the excellent script work that the series has, each episode written with total mastery, at the height of the greatest dramas in cinema and the tragedies of Shekespeare, no episode in this series will leave you indifferent, each of them maintains its own essence and does not become repetitive, the story seems to get more and more intricate and at some point the moment needs rest equivalent cumulative stress, but BrBa is so addicting that you won't be able to stop.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad is loaded with a drama of colossal proportions, an overwhelmingly intense story, filled with very outlandish supporting characters, as if they were written by the Coen Brothers or by Quentin Tarantino himself.<br/><br/>Walter White's story is made up of a rise, a fall and a transformation, really the whole series is about the transformation and change that people can experience, chemistry is like a metaphor for this, everything evolves, everything changes, shape part of a cycle that Walter explains in the pilot episode, Walter is the character that undergoes the most drastic change, Walter's change is one of the most incredible character developments written in a script, at the end of the series Walter is unrecognizable, that sweet and loving man we knew no longer exists, cancer has eaten Walter, metaphorically cancer is evil, Walter's change to an amoral man feels authentic, since the journey feels real, the situations that have endured Walter are overwhelming and have pushed him to the limit, to bring out the darkest of the character.<br/><br/>The rest of the characters have an equally deep and intelligent story, Jesse suffers collateral damage from the actions of his partner and throughout the story, everything seems to go from bad to worse for him, and his damage is understandable, heartbreaking and empathic.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad is an achievement for Tv if someone asks me what is the best movie in history, probably my answer would be 'The Godfather' if they ask me what is the best tv serie in history, probably my answer would be 'Breaking Bad 'and has that well-earned position, BrBa is a chaotic story that intertwines lives of an entire city and becomes a microcosm of chaos, a story in which everyone involved is injured in one way or another, Walter ends up being the representation of the ambition and despicable greed, although at first he shows us as a hero, by the end of the series, we can question his supposed heroism, he ends up being the villain of the story, a perversely evil and unscrupulous villain, one of the best studies As a character in history, he could even serve in film, psychology and even philosophy classes.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad is one of the most cinematographic tv series, each of the episodes are at the level of cinematographic productions in most of the visual artistic aspects, it has a beautiful cinematographic one that reminds us of western movies, in desert landscapes and claustrophobic settings, beautiful sunsets, poetic images and a highly intelligent visual narrative. No words to describe about epic series
That's why we love like this series
It goes slowly but audience will get
Addicted to this and never stops watching... Half an hour ago I finished this wonderful tv show but even now I miss it. I can only say I wish I had seen it earlier. That's all I've got to say!<br/><br/>However this review requires a certain number of words.<br/><br/>We are lucky to have been born into this world that contains Breaking Bad. Bryan Cranston God of Acting!!! played Walter White character to perfection....character development is awesome.....Aaron Paul piece of Art.....supporting characters well done.....Vince Gilligan Numero Uno....Best series of all time....no one can match the perfection of Breaking Bad.....lots of love & respect to the team I was getting a super burrito and this was on in the background on TV . I had no idea what they were saying but I could tell the show was good. Got home and put it on in English and I could not stop watching it. I'm at a loss for words to describe this show...so I'll just say...Best TV show we might ever see An emotional rollercoaster making you rethink about everything important in life. Just finished watching the series for the 4th time, and its still just as good. Complete perfection. This is by far the best TV show you could ever watch, you might think it's all about drugs (meth) but it ain't! Its so so much more, I put this off since it was released, already watched it 3 times over in the space of 2 months, Bryan Cranston & Aaron Paul are two of the most incredible, under-rated actors to ever grace the acting podium. If you hate or dislike breaking bad, you aren't concentrating enough on the plot or the dialogue. 11 out of 10 from me! I'm adding this review after watching all 5 seasons. This is the best thing that has ever been made to watch. This is one of those shows that you're gonna remember for the rest of your life after you finish it. This might even change your taste in movies/tv shows completely and you might not like any other movie for a long time (atleast till the memory of this show starts to fade). First three seasons are just build ups, the real thrill is in 4th and 5th season. But even the first season won't leave your attention for one second. The better thing of breaking bad are th character. Hank's storyline is amazing and interesting and Gustavo fring is the greatest villain. I like Vince Gilligan's knowledge of chemistry
and perfectioness about human nature according to situation.
10 out of 10 for vince gillligan knowledge
10 out of 10 for bryan Cranston for perfect acting reacting and dialogues This is pretty well known as one of the best shows of all time. I agree. There's not much more I have to say, it's a great show. I fell in love with the show and i felt sad when it was over , this is one of the fewer shows that you can't find any plot hole , it was done perfectly, developing of the character walter white from season 1 until season 5 is just brilliant!! You feel that this a true story not acting !! One of the most interesting things about this show is that it makes you change your ideology and your values and you find your self have sympathy for a criminal and even support all the decisions he is making! ON the contrary you hate his wife skyler just because she doesn't support him ! But the truth is she is the one who is right ! He is a criminal and yet we viewers find ourselves encouraging criminal's actions !! One of the best ever ! After wanting to watch this series through , after so much accolades it has been given, and starting a few episodes quite a few times but having to cease for various reasons, finally was in position to be able to. Sorry I waited but dang was it worth it to finally get through it! Everything that's been written, reviewed, praised... all 100 % accurate!!! I was SO blown away by in particular the last season which even had me talking to the TV which I have only done in one other TV series, which was " The Shield" , which I consider to be the best "Cop" show ever! As been said, absolutely everything about this show from creation, writing, acting , directing, filming etc. etc. just off the charts and I will be revisiting it hopefully many more times in my remaining lifetime! It is certainly deserving of all the attention, awards and praise it has received-
" Yo bi*ches"😁 Season 1 is a masterpiece of storytelling and art. Yet from there, the show only gets more beautiful in its art and more dense with flawless writing. It has some of the greatest cinematography, editing, performances, writing, direction and set design. It is meticulous. Bryan Cranston gives the greatest performance ever on television. Likewise, Vince Gilligan provides the greatest storytelling ever on television, from his incomparable story structure, marvellous shot composition and movement, exemplary editing, thrilling dialogue and character studies, and an overall genius awareness of mine-en-scene and groundbreaking narrative. It is on the level of filmmaking as some of the greats in cinema. It is far beyond any other tv show, in every sense, and is about as perfect a television series as we're likely to ever see. Call me mad, I had seen breaking Bad 5 times<br/><br/>Yes 5 times, and I think this's a unique art even made in the history Yeah, easily the best tv show ever. Acting, writing etc. It's all perfect. Even if you are not an avid Television Show fan. For instance, let's say that you don't like investing dozens of hours into a television show series, which almost all always jump the shark, Breaking Bad will be the exception to your valid viewpoint and a must-watch that you unlikely will regret the investment into it. Or if you do like prestige series like the Sopranos, The Wire, Mad Men, then you will also definitely like Breaking Bad.<br/><br/>This show will blow your mind. You can forget about every trope of every show you ever watched in the sense that you think you know what will happen next, or what the show is really about, or its style and tone. It is unlike anything ever made before. The only really thing that stands out that can be compared to it the most is like Pulp Fiction, or maybe a comparison to the Godfather in terms of its legacy on its medium- Television vs Movies. But it's just so unique that even those comparisons probably don't explain what it actually is.<br/><br/>The good news, too, is that it is highly addictive and a fast-paced story, with the exception of a few slower character building episodes once in a while, but if you are a fan of art, you will actually enjoy those episodes also, as they build the tension up for what's to come. In other words, you don't have to worry about getting caught up into a boring slog or quagmire of a viewing experience. This is especially the case for the later seasons, where every single episode is a "page turner".<br/><br/>The best way to watch Breaking Bad is to binge watch it, meaning to string along anywhere from 6-12 episodes at a time per sitting (possibly more). It doesn't come off as an actual TV series, but more like a 46-hour long-form movie (there are 62 episodes, but they roughly add up to 46 hours), and you'll especially understand this statement when you reach the final seasons, where all of your time investment will be rewarded from the previous seasons.<br/><br/>So find a window of time you can space out in your life, anywhere from 4 to 10 days, and just jump right into it and experience it in the best way.<br/><br/>Season 1: 8.5/10
Season 2: 8.9/10
Season 3: 8.9/10
Season 4: 9.8/10
Season 5: 11/10<br/><br/>Show Total: 99.1% Pure (Just kidding- 10/10) The best show ever. Like you really have to watch it I give this a 10 because in my opinion this is the best... it's hard to have a show from start to finish execute on all levels. The music, acting, cinematography, SYMBOLISM, and intensity is so infectious that I would recommend it to anyone. At times this show genuinely scared me..... it scared me because I honestly thought this might be how it is in the meth drug dealing world. Granite this is a tv show but damn....it made me feel that way and I can't help it. Vince Gilligan you are a true artist and I will give you a standing ovation for this series. Thank you so much. Why I am writing the 1532th review for Breaking Bad? Everything that had to be said about this show has already been said. Well, simple because, no matter how much time passes, how many times I rewatch it, I simple cannot stop been blow away by this story, a story about transformation.<br/><br/>Vince Gilligan said that he was going to take Mr.Chips and turn it into Scarface, however, I don't think even him could have realize how magnificent this journey about transformation would be. How many epic, shocking and heartbreaking moment it would have. How many compelling character we would watch interact.<br/><br/>Walter White has simple the greatest character arc of all time, there is no question about it, I can't find a more compelling story than watching a man slowly go from your simple every day school teacher to the greatest villain in tv history.<br/><br/>The transformation is not only present in Walter White but in also the first characters we see in this show that all go through a journey of change, from Jesse to Skyler to Hank and Mary. And of course, we also have some characters that never change but that with their actions, they contributed to the transformation of Walter White, Gus Fring and Mike been two of the best antagonist ever.<br/><br/>The acting is flawless, the direction is brilliant, the story... could be the greatest story ever told. Season 1: 7/10
Season 2: 8/10
Season 3: 8/10
Season 4: 9/10
Season 5: 9/10 I haven't seen any tv show like this. It's absolutely perfect and it has the greatest ending in the history of television. I literally cried for 20 minutes after the finale. I have no words to describe how spectacular this is. Each episode surpasses the previous one and you're always surprised by everything that happens. He never loses his rhythm and has an unparalleled levelI have no words to describe how spectacular this is. Each episode surpasses the previous one and you're always surprised by everything that happens. He never loses his rhythm and has an unparalleled level. Best tv entertainment ever
Nice build up
Best story
Acting is top notch One of the greatest tv series in the history , once in a life time must watch , don't miss it ðŸ’¯ , you will love it ðŸ‘Œ Best show of all time. I apparently need to write a longer review for this to count but the title of the review summed it up. Honestly the best series I have ever watched. 10 star would be less for Bryan Cranston. Probably the best show ever made.
This show have some magical powers which made me to see this show for second time maybe even more. Its not a show! Its a feeling Greatest series of all time no series can match its level. ðŸ’¯
100/10 "Breaking Bad". What an unbelievable show.<br/><br/>Great writing. Great filmmaking. Great acting.<br/><br/>This was so well done all around. I would give it a 10/10 but it's not fully there for me to be a full 10/10........<br/><br/>you know what no. I have no downsides on the top of my mind. So, I'm going to change it to a 10/10.<br/><br/>Thank you for making such a gem. The show is so good that I want to go back in time and rewatch it again. The characters were so neatly developed along the show. One of the very shows which gets better with time. Kudos to the writers and directors for making this masterpiece. Literally the only show that only gets better and better with every season, and when you think it couldn't get any better than this....BAM it gets freaking better than before. Opening scenes of each episode really are something.
Truth is I would run out of superlatives talking about this masterpiece.
The acting the story the ending, everything about this show is perfect.<br/><br/>One of the best that's for sure. I have no words to describe the satisfaction i felt by the conclusion of this show. I've never lived for myself. I mean, choice. This life is pushed forward, there has never been a real choice. Then came cancer, and I had to choose how to deal with it. The doctors debated whether to live another year or two, as if that were the only thing that mattered. But what if I just live, if I can't work and I can't eat and I can't have sex? I don't want to be in a bed like a vegetable, and that's the last you remember of me." If there is any show deserves a 10/10, it's Breaking Bad, Simply the greatest We want new season series. Like Narcos. I Watched more than 50 series season. And Breakin Bad is 1st place Just go watch it already. It's probably one of the best TV shows I have ever watched. I suddenly realized that the original real inspirational drama should be to teach us these hard pressed people how to have fun in the desperation of life. Breakingbad did it. This should be my favorite drama after sixfeeunder. AMC is the guarantee of another boutique product after HBO. Bryan Cranston pushed the whole play to an unprecedented peak with his exquisite acting skills close to film making. Whata writing, casting everything is perfect each one of the cast deserve a great moments. i think the television history cannot come in to this way everything in this series perfect I loved it oh god... Each & Every Characters are best at it's role!
Walter White, Jesse Pinkman, Gustavo Fring, Saul Godman, Hank, Mike everyone are mindblowing. Not a single episode is unnecessary.
This series was building a devastating and unbelievably big construct of lies and unfortunate situations - simply amazing.
Acting 10/10, suspense 10/10, story 10/10.<br/><br/>Not only in its own genre at the very top.
I'll never forget this ride. Heisenberg never stops to cooking...
One of the greatest series to watch even 10+ years later.This must be in list for every movie lover. The legacy of breaking bad is gonna stay for a long long time. Thnks Vince Gilligan for this masterpiece. It just can't get any better. Neither was, is and nor will be a better TV series ever be created. I'm just speechless. There are no words to describe what the actors and writers have achieved. I just finished watching the show and I am unable to come back to my senses. The story just gets you so engrossed, you can't not think about it. It's a must watch. A large thanks to Vince Gilligan, Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul and all the other actors.
THANK YOU !!! I used to be one of those people that got easily pleased by everything in media, enjoyed it, and ignored writing flaws. Then I watched this show, observed the writing and direction and realized that THIS is what high quality writing looks like. Ever since, I've been a harsh critic of TV and Film. Unless it has Breaking Bad quality writing, I'll criticize it to bits. Which is why I barely watch modern television anymore. I'm stuck in the good old days of TV. I thought that GOT was on par with Breaking Bad's level of writing in it's first 3-4ish seasons. But that writing quality been going down a drain since S5. This show has made it clear. THIS is the staple of what all modern TV shows and movies should strive to be. Cohesive, immerseful, thoughtful and entertaining.<br/><br/>Hats off to you Vince Gilligan. Hats off to you and the BRILLIANT cast!<br/><br/>Best show I've ever watched. I'm on marathon #10 or something I have just watched this for the second time and found it just as addictive as first time round. Phenomenal from start to finish with a great cast and storyline that will blow your mind! You won't see another series like this in a very very long time. Nothing else in the drama history can compare with this one. Not even Game of Thrones. Just a DAMN. 👌🏽 Breaking Bad is the greatest tv show of all time, with not a bad episode, performance, plot line or anything. This is a perfect show! Bryan Cranston gives the best performance I've seen an actor give and Aaron Paul gives the second best! The series finale is the best finale the show could've had, the entire show goes in ways you don't expect but are so glad happen! Breaking Bad is perfect!! After watching this series for the 5th time, I would still concider this the greatest TV-show ever created. I can't say how incredible it is. I didn't know that I'm addicted to BrBa until it ended and then, nothing was good enough to watch. Absolutely brilliant show, tense and nail biting and with some of the best characters ever in a drama. Up there with Deadwood as the best thing ever to grace the small screen. I really felt this show has made me a better person , normally you don't get so emotional and connected to a TV show but this was something else especially the final 3 episodes.This show will always stay with me in my heart and I regret watching it now,should have been done much earlier
I don't think anything else can top this show,Vince Gilligan is an absolute genius and thank you for taking me on a roller coaster of a ride of feelings that I can't explain
Truly the best The greatest tv show in the world perfect in every way the story the acting is incredible I am going to miss it Probably the only show I've ever watched start to finish 3 times.. probably the best t.v series to ever air period!
I'd rate 11/10 if I could! Everything is well acted from the begining to the end, good job , and thanks for bringing Breaking Bad. Man how could someone think like what Vince Gilligan has done. His mastermind has payed off. And the cast who made it possible deserves a huge respect. The whole team deserves a golden statue in Albuquerque. Best tv series I have ever watched in my life. There will never be a tv series that can break BREAKING BAD. Walter White's tragedy is one of the better told tragedies since Oedipus.<br/><br/>Walter White will go down in history as one of the most complex characters in TV.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad is a perfect 10/10 because it is a story well told. The build up is amazing, the CHARACTERS have meaning, they all do something and they all have their development. The story is engaging from the go and the ending is just as unexpected as it is obvious.<br/><br/>Six years later no movie, and no TV series has ever come close to what Breaking Bad has accomplished. Probably no one will ever surpasses it.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad is the definition of drama.<br/><br/>It is the king of drama, a tragedy that would make the Greeks proud. The best thing in the series is the actors and the story and every thing its amazing show Hands down one of the best TV show that has been written and produced so well !
It gets better with every season and every episode !! Got season 8 reminded me of my love for this show, best show there ever was and will be Breaking Bad is definitely in the top 5 of my all time best TV series . I have just finished watching it for a second time and enjoyed it just as much or more than my first viewing. Can't understand the bad reviews that this show is getting but "To each his own " This has to be quite simply the finest tv show of all time. A story that is expertly crafted, with so many unseen twists and turns. The most incredible production values and attention to detail. And the performance of Bryan Cranston? Simply the best acting performance of all time bar none. The arc of the story and the characters is utterly mesmerising. I loved every minute of this show and feel bereft that there is no more. Sensational Vince Gilligan, you are magnificent. Beautifully written and directed. A school teacher diagnosed with cancer takes up meth cooking to provide his family, only to fall into a rabbit hole - gradually lacking justifiable actions. Walter White starts off promising with his partner-in-crime Jesse Pinkman, only for his Chemistry skills to develop enough traction, which eventuates into a full-blown drug empire - all right under his brother-in-law's nose! This idea for a series only pops into the minds of geniuses, and that is exactly what Vince Gilligan is. First 2 seasons will be little slow..but after that..just awesome..great acting by all..Worth watching and must watch series.. Yes that's right, Breaking Bad is the best tv show in the history of tv shows. Breaking Bad is one of the few things on IMDb that I have rated a perfect 10/10 and here's why... Walter White's transformation from a low self esteem, overqualified chemistry high school teacher to the polar opposite of that spectrum as Heisenberg (no spoilers) is honestly extraordinary and fascinating to watch. Bryan Cranston's performance as Walter White/Heisenberg is the best performance ever put to screen and his costars (Aaron Paul, Anna Gunn and etc) are also exceptional and consistent and could not be played by anyone else. What I love about Breaking Bad so much is the subtleties in the writing and acting, the metaphors are so well done and the characters are rich with complex and interesting arcs. The whole show feels very consistent, with each scene having significant purpose to the plot and with each spoken line well thought out and meaningful. One of the best things about Breaking Bad is that you can put your faith in the creators, that you can trust that they know where to take the story and how to end characters' journeys, because they do deliver superbly on every case. The directing doesn't usually stand out (bar some of the best episodes/scenes) however the writing and dialogue between the characters absolutely makes up for this, it can be extremely sad then darkly comical but then incredibly shocking, all whilst retaining cohesiveness. It has great music which enhances the montages and shocking scenes to make them more memorable and iconic. Some of the story is not always memorable however this simply increases the rewatchability of it. The biggest complaint I hear about Breaking Bad is that the first few seasons are relatively slow and uneventful compared to the rest. But my argument is this: it's 'slow' because it needs to be, there isn't as much action because Walter White is still in the early stages of his transformation (and it also makes the few action scenes even more shocking and surprising by the time they do happen). This is not to say that the show's beginning is bad by any means it merely contains more character development and relationship building aspects that become important later in the show. However it does get better and more fast paced and action packed as the seasons progress. I don't see this as a flaw, in fact I see this as a necessity for such a deep character study. We need to see how his life was before it became what it did so that it can be hard hitting and intriguing when the change does happen. This transformation needs to happen slowly and subtly for it to be effective, so that you can't look back at a single point where Walter White became Hesienberg, you can only see how every episode he becomes more malicious and manipulative. It's great how every episode builds up to a climax, every season builds up to a climax, and the show as a whole is one big cresecendo towards the last few nauseatingly shocking (in my experience anyway) and immensely satisfying final episodes. Every episode delivers, in my opinion there is not one single 'bad' episode. To conclude, Breaking Bad made me laugh, it made me cry, made my stomach churn, it made me want to scream at my television, it made me literally nauseated with tension. It's subtle, nuanced, full of metaphors and hidden meanings with plot hints. The acting, story and writing is complex, intricate and some of the best the industry has to offer (kudos to Bryan Cranston, one of the greatest actors of our generation). I have rewatched this show many times over the years, and I will continue to do so. Breaking Bad is the only TV show I have ever seen that truly deserves a 10/10 rating. I cannot even find the smallest flaw that doesn't come down to just personal preference of the viewer. If I had to give one negative about this Breaking Bad, it's that it's quite draining and depressing once you have finished the last season, which doesn't detract from the quality of the show at all. I strongly recommend that you watch this, and know that I'll be jealous that you get to experience for the first time the rollercoaster ride that is Breaking Bad This show is written so well. For years I didn't want to watch the show because I thought it was all about drugs but it ended up being my favorite tv show of all time. I've been in this world for 35 years and without a doubt this is the best series Iv'e ever seen. This show is a great demonstration of what drugs, greed and money will do to ones life. The cast is absolutely perfect!! They were suppose to kill off Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) at the end of season one. I wonder what the show would have been like without him. So thankful they didn't. BB is perfectly written and very addicting. this one is the best<br/><br/>i watch already 10+ shows but this is something different <br/><br/>that story between Jesse and Walter is amazing also TV show with amazing cameras like POV etc. and one of the best soundtrack in TV show too<br/><br/>Walter character development is just on the other level from chemistry teacher to King of the Kings :) <br/><br/>the fifth season is the best seasons of every TV shows<br/><br/>sometimes i was bored at the breakfast but then is totally worth it :) <br/><br/>11/10 MASTERPIECE<br/><br/>(my first review because i wanted to have one) I very rarely write reviews on here as I never feel the need, but I have to say something about Breaking Bad, having just watched the entire 5 seasons. Well, there is no more to be said that hasn't already been said about this show. The only thing that I find disappointing about Breaking Bad is that it hasn't achieved a 10/10 rating on IMDb. I would be very interested to meet the people who can give this show anything less than a 10 rating. I mean, how good can a TV show be? I watched the entire series over a two week period, sometimes not getting to bed until 3am, and not through choice... i really need my sleep. Breaking Bad was my world for those few weeks. This show could be unsurpassable. With all the TV I have watched in my lifetime, this one show is my favorite of all time. It has everything: great acting, great writing, it's exciting and intelligent. There is not a single wasted moment, not a single predictable lazy/clichéd storyline in the entire show.<br/><br/>When I first started watching, I must admit I was turned off. The show seemed dark, depressing and bleak. I mean come on... some boring middle-aged white dude working two jobs, putting up with his bitchy wife, a special-needs son, AND cancer? But as the plot goes on, it's soon becomes quite inspiring. What it all comes down to is that this is a story about an emasculated, downtrodden man who finds his mojo. The cancer is his wake-up call; Facing death in the face, he finally begins to embrace life. Watching the transformation is a joy to behold.<br/><br/>Now, I am sure many would protest how I have characterized the show here. It is typical for Walt's character development to be described as as a downward spiral into evil, selfishness, and narcissism. And he does indeed have moments, particularly in the last seasons, where he seems to have hit the moral rock bottom. But I think when you go out and live life to fullest, you have to accept that sometimes you are going to make mistakes, sometimes you'll have to be the bad guy.<br/><br/>In any case, you don't have to like Walt's character to like the show. In this show there are no heroes, definitely some villains, but no heroes. In many stories there is often a trade-off between action and character development; either you have a slow plodding show with great 3-dimensional characters, or an action-packed explosion-fest with little character development or nuance in the direction. But this show has it all; Every single episode has such tight cinematography, excellent dialogue and characterizations, every episode makes you hungry to see the next one and see what happens next. The way the plot unfolds with its ups and downs, exciting moments and slow moments, is PERFECT.<br/><br/>I'm not going to go through every character, they all did a great job, but I have to single out Aaron Paul, who plays Jesse. I think he stands out as the greatest acting performance of the show. His youthful, bright-eyed character is the heart and soul of the show, and he could not have done acted it better.<br/><br/>So anyway, if you haven't seen this show yet, I envy you, because you get to see it for the first time and I can't again. I supposed someone might not like the show if they are particularly squeamish about drugs or violence, but even if you are you might like the show anyway. "Breaking Bad" is the darkest show on TV, and possibly the best. The main character, Walt White, is a high school chemistry teacher with cancer, a pregnant wife, a disabled son, and no savings. Hoping to leave a nest egg when he dies, he teams up with a young lowlife and begins cooking crystal meth. Walt and his accomplice are in way over their heads, and get into one harrowing scrape after another, from stranding themselves in the desert to being kidnapped by a psycho drug lord. <br/><br/>Deep ironies abound. Walt's double life entangles him in so many lies he can't keep track of them all. This damages his relationship with his family (who were the reason he started cooking meth in the first place). Unforeseen complications keep sabotaging Walt's drug operation and eating into the money he makes. As he puts it, everything is "one step forward, two steps back." <br/><br/>"Breaking Bad" approaches its characters with a penetrating sense of human frailty and zero sentimentality. Though Walt's a sympathetic character, he does many unsympathetic things. His wife, loyal and moral almost to a fault, nurses a secret crush on a former boss. Walt's young accomplice has an inconvenient streak of decency, but not enough to overcome his own essential weakness and stupidity.<br/><br/>The hypocrisy and "quiet desperation" of middle-class suburban life have been worked to death in books, movies, and TV. "Breaking Bad" gives these themes new life with clear-eyed, pitiless characterizations, brilliant acting, gripping plot twists, imaginative visual style, and grim black humor. The nearest analogy I can think of is to Flaubert's "Madame Bovary." "Breaking Bad" is a masterpiece. By Far the Best Show on TV Ever! The show captures you from the very first scene of the very first episode. Week after week I sat on the edge of my seat as Breaking Bad would unfold in HD and the beauty of New Mexico combined with the masterful writing and cinematography left me breathless. I laughed, I cried, I got mad, I got sad, I was stunned but through it all I totally enjoyed every episode. The show is so solid in every aspect it's a treat to watch and enjoy. From the Pilot of Breaking Bad in 2008 Season 1 to "Felina" the sixteenth episode of the fifth season of Breaking Bad and the sixty-second episode of the series altogether. It is the final episode of the series. It's been a bittersweet ride. I love this show and now that it's over I'm burning my TV. The Characters are spot on, story, actors, directing, writing, everything about this show is phenomenally perfect. It's absolutely unpredictable. you simply don't know and won't know what happens next until it actually happens thats how intense and mind-blowing this show is. Before i started watching this show i never really knew Bryan Cranston, i mean i've seen him couple of times here and there but nothing like this. Honestly calling him a Great actor is somewhat of an understatement, the guy is simply Exceptional.<br/><br/>From the antics of the first episode, the show is leading towards a dark place, but a place of truth. if you haven't watched "BREAKING BAD" I suggest you start, because not even "Game of Thrones" (which i value and Rank as 2nd in my all time favourite list) is no where near Breaking Bad.<br/><br/>Kudos to Mr Gilligan and everyone involved in creating this masterpiece!! The sign of a good actor is the ability to be completely believable in the part they are playing.<br/><br/>Brian Cranston played the manic Hal in 'Malcolm in the Middle' a role that was likable but not outstanding by any means.<br/><br/>'Breaking Bad' is a revelation, it's like watching a butterfly emerge from a chrysalis, Brian Cranston is just brilliant as Walter White, he plays an over qualified chemistry teacher who discovers that he has cancer. This discovery completely changes his perspective on life, the realisation that his mediocre life could soon be over and he has little to show for it triggers a change in life that simply leads from one amazing drama to another.<br/><br/>Crystal meth is not something that should be taken on lightly in any drama, happily this is not the case here, and the program tackles these issues admirably. It shows the ups and downs of dealing, the unsavoury characters who Walter meats along his journey. What makes this show different is that it doesn't glamorise drugs; it does show what a human being is capable of put into various circumstances.<br/><br/>'Breaking Bad' is a very dark comedy; some of the light relief is give by Cranston and more especially from his co-star Aaron Paul who plays the small time drug dealer who Walter taught at school. Their relationship starts out as one of mutual benefit and over the first season blossoms to one of two people who know each other's secrets and then kinship.<br/><br/>This program as I said is a dark comedy, but don't let that fool you in any way, it is also very hard hitting, there are scenes of extreme violence which are not for those of a squeamish disposition. Then there are the complications of family life and all the realities of a cancer sufferer.<br/><br/>This program is unique in a world of knock off's and remakes; this is definitely NOT chewing gum for the brain and requires the viewer to pay attention.<br/><br/>Having watched the first season I was spellbound and couldn't wait to watch each episode to see where this drama would take us, I am happy to report having watched the first three episodes of the second season that this is no flash in the pan, the second season is starting out as good as the first season and long may it continue. The main contender for the best show of all time. It was at the top of my list for years, but was recently unseated by another show I'll leave unnamed in this review. <br/><br/>BB is a priceless piece of modern American art. A rare experience that gives life new meaning. Must see for everyone. "Binge-watching" a TV series just never occurred to me, ever. I am a busy person, raising my family, working, etc. Who has time to watch that much TV!?? Well, after a few years of certain family members suggesting I tune in to Breaking Bad, my spouse and I decided to do just that. <br/><br/>Thus began several weeks of watching this show every waking moment we weren't working or caring for the youngins', preparing meals, running errands, etc. We sat down to watch one show, and FORCED ourselves to turn off the television at 2am. We could not get enough. We would usher the kids to bed early, when possible, then run to get the computer and settle in to watch "an episode or two" on a week night (which turned out to be 4 episodes minimum!); more on the weekends. <br/><br/>In short, you think you are minding your business in your own home, watching a television show...then WWHHHAAAMMM!!!!!!! something you totally did not expect just happens on screen. This was the case with nearly EVERY episode of EVERY season of Breaking Bad. We watched all of the seasons in less than a month. <br/><br/>I cannot imagine a better written, directed, acted, or cast series....I would not watch any for about 18 months after binge-watching Breaking Bad. I figured "what is the point? what else could POSSIBLY live up!?" THAT'S how fine this series was. It is graphic, dark, suspenseful, sinister, funny at times...simply amazing in every way. I felt almost like a drug addict watching this show...so addicted to it I was, and trying to hide my obsession with it. Alas, I have moved on and am "over it" now, but if you haven't seen it, treat yourself!!!!!!! I was teased into watching Breaking Bad over the last few years but never took it up, but after recently joining Netflix picked this series.<br/><br/>What a journey! I've watched the whole series in just over 2 weeks and must say it's been a roller coaster. <br/><br/>A truly remarkable piece of work and the last episode has been emotional. I'd only heard of Aaron Paul on Top Gear a while back in which Jeremy congratulated him on his acting, and I applaud both him and Bryan Cranston (who I watched in 'Why Him') are both spectacular - not too sure what can fill this void now!<br/><br/>All the actors in this brilliant piece of art should be congratulated (loved his sons performance throughout (Roy Frank "RJ" Mitte))<br/><br/>A truly amazing roller-coaster and would recommend spending the time to watch (don't let the first 2 or three episodes put you off) I have never seen a show where the main character (Bryan Creston) changes so much from episode one to the final one. The changes at first are very subtil, starting with a character that lack self-confidence, has no back bone and such a puppy-pleasing persona...to end with a complete transformation. But again, it is so subtil and I love watching Bryan Creston getting in the "skin" of Walter White. This is acting at it's best!!! THIS MAY CONTAINS SPOILER Some of you may have not seen this show, but there is a reason why it earned so many awards and high level reviews. This is NOT a show about drug and how to make it (although it seems that way), but to me, it's a show on "how far are you willing to go to protect your family"...and then, "how far are you willing to go to lose your family". The cast is just awesome, with Jessie, Mike and Saul as bona fide supporting actor. I watched the whole seasons all over again few months ago and was just amazed by it as the first time around. This only leave me wanting more!!! RIP WW! Bryan Cranston really came into his own on the set of Malcolm in the Middle. He got all the nervous twitches, the neurotic spasms, and all the growls of a middle class dad making his way through four boys. Now, however, in this show; Breaking Bad, he throws that all away for subtly. I mean, what else do you do after you've found out that... well. Bryan Cranston is spot on as a middle class guy(yet again) who desperately wants to help his son, wife, and unborn child out financially. So, he devises a plan that only a man in his situation can, and being a chemistry teacher needs no introduction into the how.<br/><br/>Very well acted show, very well picked cast, and was I the only one surprised at the method of 'removal' for the rival drug dealers? Seriously that came out of left field. But, hey, it works, and makes sense.<br/><br/>All in all, recommended show. Bryan Cranston really brings this cast together with his sense of hopelessness. I've never seen anything like this before. These so far two seasons about a man, a father, a husband, a chemical-teacher who gets cancer and start to try out as a drug dealer is a step-by-step-analysis of which consequences this decision can have on your life, family and friends. It's a emotionally roller-coaster ride without big gun shoot-outs or explosions though it shows that many mean things are getting to control your life.<br/><br/>This show doesn't fill every clichéd that is connected to a drug dealer story so it can reach it's sure audience. No! It tries to figure out (and of course it never can be reality, but it's trying to get as close as it can) how to deal with these chliches when they're suddenly entering and ruling your ordinary, normal, average life.<br/><br/>You cannot call this a movie, though you'd like to, because it's the only thing that you can relate to that ever reached such quality. And this is why I don't want to devalue Breaking Bad just to a TV- Series that can be seen randomly on TV. Again: No! It's 15 Hours of high quality. It's 15 Hours of the best thing made out of picture and sound ever made. It's 15 Hours of Art. Art in Directing. Art in Cinematography and especially Art in Writing and Acting.<br/><br/>I love it! This show is one of the bright spots of this train wreck of a 2008 television season. Bryan Cranston has to be IMHO one of the best acting talents out there. Just compare and contrast his portrayal of the clueless father on "Malcolm in the Middle". On "Breaking Bad" his character light years different. That's not to say that his roll of Hal on "MITM" was inferior to the character of Walter White here. However he shows his "range" here VS. there. There is going to be the inevitable comparisons to "Weeds" and unfair or not there are parallels. Both center on basically good people forced to make due in order to survive or keep their families solvent--bottom line give "Breaking Bad" a chance I'm betting you will be pleasantly surprised. My only problem with this show is the incessant bleeping of the "colorful language". Either don't include it or don't bleep it, it gets very annoying after two or three bleeps. OK, we all know the synopsis: gifted but henpecked high school chemistry teacher gets lung cancer and decides to cook world class meth, hijinks ensue. But it's much more than that.<br/><br/>The show is written VERY realistically. Because Walt starts out as such a real human being, in every scene, in every episode, right to the end, the viewer finds him or herself asking, "What would I do in the same situation?" No other show has managed to do that.<br/><br/>And as the show goes on, one's answers diverge more and more because we're less in Walt's position with every episode. How would a normal person go about making and selling drugs without getting caught? What would we do when our competition came to kill us? Those may be pretty simple. But what would we do when our loved ones found out, and keeping it quiet meant harming them, for whom, we tell ourselves, we have taken all this risk in the first place?<br/><br/>They say there are only seven basic plots, and America's clear favorite is "overcoming the monster," but this is not that kind of story. It's a "tragedy" much like the greatest story ever told: The Iliad, and it has elements of a dark comedy in it. Walt is Achilleus. Gus is Hektor. The DEA and APD are the gods, not knowing who to help and where to strike, and not entirely good guys in any case. The intelligent viewer will go from rooting for Walt to hating him just slightly less than his enemies. The less intelligent viewer will go from loving Walt to merely hating his shrewish but sensible wife. But all will enjoy the show. Buckle up for the ride of your life. This show is absolutely outstanding! It's quickly become one of my all time favorites, I only remember Bryan Cranston from Malcolm in the middle and am fairly shocked by how different he is. He goes from being a completely convincing suburbanite teacher to a completely believable villain without betraying the character. At times he looks completely menacing which is probably what makes the show work because his character really isn't that way. <br/><br/>It's actually a rush at times watching the show because he's so good at sucking you into the world. There's no point in reading reviews for this show, just start watching it, you won't be able to stop. Binge watching, amazing, Vince Gilligan created a amazing show. Hats off to each team member of Breaking Bad. This is the greatest TV show I've ever seen in my life time.... If you watch this, you can't watch other shows because this is the best... This is once in a lifetime thing... God, I loved this. Everyone said it was great. I expected a lot and got even more. This series has perfect amount of everything: drama, humor, action, intelligence, darkness, building of characters... And all that with great acting, directing and scenography. Hands down, the best series I have watched till date. 10/10 I'm just 15 years old and I watched the best Tv Series of all time.
I don't know what happened to me but right after the last episodes I rreally fainted unconscious.<br/><br/>This Tv show changed me completely. Wonderful but Skyler & Ted relationship story is not good direction when Sky has a new born baby , its not tolerable . That is only negative point of this story , all over it is excellent . . The character progression in this series is one of the best i've ever seen.There are some boring episodes in middle seasons but that ending makeup for all of it. Who ever wrote this deserves the goddamn presidency. Arguably best tv series everr.... All time favorite TV series of mine in world. "I am the Danger". I am speechless after watching last episode of this TV series. I have never found myself unable to fault a show, everything about it was stellar, the start in comparison to the rest I suppose was a (little) slow but even then, it needed the buildup, the character development, the anticipation for what was to come. You already know he's going to cook meth, of-course he is, so I enjoyed that the start took it's time to establish the kind of man he was and how out of place he was about to be.<br/><br/>I waited over 11 years to watch this show, not entirely by choice but because I too, fell victim to Hype fear and maybeee lacked someone to share the experience with (almost as hard as finding someone who hasn't seen game of thrones).<br/><br/>This show is an experience, it is a glimpse into a realistic, logical world where a man is driven over an edge. There is no suspending ones disbelief, there is really no exaggeration, it feels as raw and real as life. The conversation flows like Eminem in his prime time and is as complex as a 1,000,000 piece puzzle. Characters have the depth of the ocean and the acting paints a gorgeous picture, one where every single stroke on the canvas is thoroughly thought about.<br/><br/>If you're yet to watch this show, try to find someone to watch it with! Being able to talk about it has been wonderful and most people by now seem to have forgotten the plot points I wish to discuss. But if you fail in your endeavour watch it anyway, It's the biggest entertainment based favour I have done for myself! Pretty much as the title says, best of all time.
I had watched exactly 63 TV shows. Many of them I had finished and a few were boring I was unable to finish, however I finished Breaking Bad 3 times , with literally the same amount of excitement each time. Thank you so much Vince, Bryan, Aaron, Anna, Betsy, RJ, Dean, Bob, Jonathan and most importantly the one who portrayed my favorite villain of all time Giancarlo. This show will forever be in my heart. The perfect TV show doesn't exist. Vince Gilligan: "Hold my coffee."<br/><br/>At first I was sceptical about Breaking Bad , because people were so extremely hyped about it. It can't be that good, right? Boy, was I wrong. One of my main concerns was Bryan Cranston. Or as I knew him at the time: Hal from Malcom in the Middle. A TV show I grew up with. I quickly forget his past due to his amazing acting and now know him as Walter White and Heisenberg.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad did many things perfect in it's 5 seasons. Every single actor managed to play their part and nobody slipped up. And the quality never dipped in 5 seasons. I don't know how they did it, but Breaking Bad managed to stay great from beginning to end. And more importantly they went out with a bang. They could've easily dragged the show on for 3 or 4 more seasons and earned way more money, but instead they chose to end Breaking Bad on a high note.<br/><br/>I can recommend this TV show to every single person. Avoid spoilers at all costs if you haven't seen the show and enjoy the ride! This series was amazing. I don't know anyone who has watched it and didn't like it, or didn't argue that it was the best series ever made. The writing is not rushed at all, the acting is perfect, but the camera work is probably one of the strongest points.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad follows the formula of "show, don't tell". In this case, a technique that allows the viewer to experience what is happening through action and acting itself instead of plain exposition. The acting is so good and because of how good it is, you, the viewer, are able to perceive exactly how the characters feel. Every last one of the actors and actresses are excellent in their job to act. Because of the good acting, Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul are some of my favourite actors, and I've noticed that their acting is just as good in other productions, if not better than ever.<br/><br/>If you didn't know already, the plot is about a Chemistry professor who decides to use his expertise by producing the world's purest crystal meth in order to insure his family's financial status after his death, using a former student of his who deals drugs.<br/><br/>This show begins with very mildly humorous, to dark, dramatic, fairly action-y, and just downright epic the more it goes on. The seasons are not rushed, the directing is top notch. I've even read from people that the fact that it ended made them pretty much depressed. Normally I wouldn't believe that, but then, I did experience it for myself because the show is THAT good. The OST is great. Each episode even has it's own brief OST in the credits after the first season.<br/><br/>I have heard that some don't like it, usually because of the whole hype and "WOW BREAKING BAD IS SO GREAT" fans bothering them with it. I understand that, but if you watched the show and tried to ignore them, you'd like it.<br/><br/>If there's one word to describe this show and the main character, that word is Badass. Don't skip the opportunity to watch it. BB and GOT thaught me its not important how u start a Tv series but how well you actually end it. Vince galligan made it sure BB stays the best. BB started slow/boring with its 1st 2 season bt the pace after it was mind blowing and the way it ended was awww-some.
Whereas coming to GOT 1st 4 season were 11/10 bt once D&D took over they ruined it. The end was not supposed to meant this way. I am here after the GOTs last seasons 4th episode heart broken after giving these many year to GOT and the end u get its literally disappointing. Had a doubt between BB and GOT which is best so after GOTs season 8, BB for sure remains the best of best series in this world :) I watched all of Breaking Bad twice. Why? Because this show is so addicting, it never gets old. It's a drama, but it isn't afraid to add on some comedy on there. Like when Walter smokes Jesse's weed, that was just hilarious! And the 'meme' of how Walt Jr. loves breakfast, hilarious.<br/><br/>But, one of my main reasons I love this show so much, is how Jesse and Walter's relationship grew, and had it's ups and downs. Walter grew into caring about him.Protecting Jesse, when he didn't need to. He could've easily ditched him when Jesse was in trouble but he never left, he was like family, you never leave family. Even when in the fifth season, when Jesse tried to torch his house, Walter didn't want him dead. Like he said, 'He isn't just some Rabid Dog.' He truly believed that Jesse could come to his senses. <br/><br/>Another thing, is the tracks they picked was catchy, and made a lot of scenes, so bad ass! (ex. stay out of my territory scene) It was spot on, and the POV's was amazing.<br/><br/>Another thing I absolutely loved about this show. The ending. At the ending, it tied up (well, most of them) loose ends, and it had some moments of revenge, like how Walt killed Jack in mid-sentence like how he did with Hank. Perfect ending, for a perfect show. At the end of season 4 my heart was pounding. Watching Breaking Bad is probably the most physically animated I have ever been whilst watching a TV series (hands over my eyes, laughing, gasping and actually talking at the TV). I have watched many excellent TV programmes, but engaged with this one unlike any other.<br/><br/>With characters that felt so real I thought about them long after credits. It is perfectly paced, beautifully shot, scripted and totally unpredictable.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad is not something I would recommend to everyone, but then this is not a show for the masses. The events unfold with unease, shock and excitement, with intricate and fascinating characters, including dead-behind-the-eyes Gus, and hilarious sham lawyer Saul.<br/><br/>If you are interested in morality, the ambiguity of relationships, have a dark sense of humour, and love a detailed TV series such as The Sopranos and The Wire, I don't need to tell you anymore: Go and watch it. Right now. Generally, I only watch Sci-Fi, Horror and such-- but every once in a while I'm drawn to regular TV if it isn't run-of-the-mill Canned-Ha-Ha-Ha comedy or standardized Network Primetime Drama with the usual A-Z cast of Beautiful People pretending to mimic Real Life interspersed with Fun Commercials as the rest of us would Like it to be.<br/><br/>The storyline is simple: Ordinary Middle-class Teacher in an Ordinary Burb with ordinary Financial problems with an Ordinary Sucky Life finds out he has Cancer. Which makes every ordinary thing suck even worse. So he turned his Ordinary chemistry skills to Illegality so he can make some money--quick. And we get to watch the whole set of terrible, unfolding, yet still very ORDINARY set of events. And you just KNOW, it's not going down a very good road at all, but like a car with no brakes heading down a long mountain road, you have no choice but to clutch the wheel and hang on for dear life.<br/><br/>I've heard and read of this show described as black comedy. I wouldn't put it quite like that. Black Humor is the best phrase I can come up with-- but the humor is a brilliant side-effect of the story. It's somewhere in the middle-- as in between Black and Grey. . .like Charcoal: the type that comes off on your fingers.<br/><br/>I don't laugh or even chuckle; I wince. I cringe. I say: "Oh my god! No, No!" If this is comedy-- it's the comedy that Hurts and cuts. It's the laughter that comes out of an adult mouth that doesn't have a smile on it: and oh yes, he's laughing as only an Adult can.<br/><br/>The people in this show hold me because it isn't the parade of Beautiful People and Perfect Families that Hollywood and the Networks keeps trying to brainwash us with. Painfully ordinary. The houses, the school, the people, the motives, the lighting, the camera-work. And I am watching Working Man Walter White grasp for something lasting to keep hold of. . .and I am ROOTING for him!<br/><br/>This show is Different. It's Drama about Quiet Desperation with an edge of Black Humor that will touch a lot of Uncomfortable places that we are not used to seeing on our friendly Network Screens. Yet when you see it, you are shocked that the creators have DARED to film it and make it look so. . .plausible and painful. Bravo!! What can be said about this spectacular saga that hasn't been said before? One of the very few series that competes with the best films in history for cinematic storytelling. Like a great novel slowly unfolding, it's funny, heartbreaking, incredibly tense, deeply disturbing. <br/><br/>A nebbishy high-school science teacher finds he has lung cancer, so becomes a meth dealer to make money for his family before his death. Often visually stunning, with a breathtaking performance by Brian Cranston in the lead, and great work from all the supporting roles, this portrait of a man's decent into hell couldn't be much better, and it just grows darker and more disturbing each year. <br/><br/>In a way, thematically it recalls "The Godfather I and II" in how that epic charts Michael's journey from innocence to darkness, along with the moral murkiness of the American drive for money and success - how we lose ourselves, so that succeeding and having ever more becomes an end in itself for which we will pay any price, rather than a route to happiness, trapping us in a game we can never win.<br/><br/>Kudos too, to creator Vince Gilligan to have the courage to end the show at just the right time rather than string it out past where the story would bear. It may take a few episodes to get into, but you owe it to yourself to try. This is powerful, important and utterly enthralling stuff. The best show ever indeed.......................................... Flawless script, flawless acting, flawless directing, literally everything was so perfect. It will forever remain in history as the greatest show ever. The arc of this character--series creator Vince Gilligan's invention of Walter White as a sick soul--is, it's clear now. One of the great narratives in Television history. Breaking Bad was a radical type of television, and also a very strange kind of must-watch: a show that you dread and crave at the same time. A show that managed year after year to accomplish that rare blend of Hollywood darling and fan favorite All the characters are written in a complex, deep and fascinating way. Series creator Vince Gilligan is a pure uncut genius and it shows behind and In front of the camera. Season 5 stands to up the ante more than any one prior, with fantastic twists, incredibly tense moments, more great standout music to fit the scenes properly, and acting that can't be beat. I came out of season 4 saying that there was no way to top the amazing conclusion to one of the greatest television seasons ever, but they have seemed to manage just that. Without giving too much away, relationships are tested, characters die, new bonds form, and more meth is cooked. I think it should be a crime to not watch this show, maybe equal to cooking meth with the intent to distribute. <br/><br/>This series is an absolute masterpiece. It is a work of art! If We had a chance to send a capsule of earths most important items to another planet, this series would have to be included! Not only did this show break bad but it broke the type of medium of television beyond the pit of mediocrity it usually resides in. It may be awhile for which a show of this caliber comes along, maybe once in a life time. This is a series that I will always cherish, and not just for the obvious reasons like the superb acting and the high stakes narrative -- but also for the fact that it gave me hope for the future of television, and the media's potential overall, to serve as a platform for talented writers and actors who actually have something inspired to say about the world we live in. Walter white is perhaps tvs best anti hero that you will feel dirty even rooting for till the very end, and what a perfect ending it is! This show has so much material that it gave birth to the brilliant prequel Better Call Saul. if you haven't had the privilege of seeing televisions arguably best of all time, congrats because you're about to embark on a journey like no other! You will wind up making 99% pure crystal blue meth and demand everyone call you Heisenberg. But seriously, you now have 5 seasons to binge watch on Netflix. I envy you! Other people have written much about the characters in the show so it doesn't require me to add to that.<br/><br/>However Breaking Bad has some of the cleverest writing I have ever encountered in the making of a television show. The twist and turns of the story over so many seasons are outstanding.<br/><br/>To any budding script writers this is a almost perfect example of how to write a script. The writers and producers of Breaking Bad cooked something new up. They turned on the stove, put on a big pot and mixed in an array of ingredients. They simmered some spices and flavors while frying up some chicken.<br/><br/>The end result was some forty six hours of pure entertainment. But this wasn't your ordinary show. Nothing conventional you would expect took place from years of conditioning from other shows. It never took the easy way out just to wrap up a story line. Breaking Bad took you into the dark corners and recesses of the human psyche, all while ensuring it also drummed up plenty of laughs to let you know not to take it so seriously. <br/><br/>What was it going for? Was this just some mindless action? Some intelligent thriller? An entertaining dark comedy? A drama? At times it was all of these things, but what Breaking Bad actually is is a morality tale. While producing entertaining storytelling styles competently throughout the series, it ultimately is a cautionary tale about the disintegration of the human soul. It explores why an intelligent person can turn to the dark side and realistically details exactly how that can occur. <br/><br/>Such plotting and centralized character studying and development goes far beyond Chemistry. It moves into quantum physics, philosophy, and metaphysics. Brilliantly, as Breaking Bad carves out its own universe in a detailed degree that the criminal world of Albuquerque, New Mexico becomes a character of its own, it begs the question of what world, or universe, the main character Walter White has decided to embark down, or live in. In the theory of parallel or multiple universes (multiverse), this decision for the antihero to choose to alter his course into a different world sets the stage for the disintegration of his soul. Every step he takes and decision he makes in his chosen universe contrasts the old universe he could have chosen to live in. Metaphorically, on an elementary level, one can say that he chose to live in hell. As the saying goes, "The road to hell is paved with good intentions". <br/><br/>Thus, while Breaking Bad is window-dressed with crystal meth, it is actually an exploratory journey of the human soul, and how each decision one makes can not only hurt themselves but also impact everyone around them. Breaking Bad has no fear in applying this cosmic-karmic revelation. Through subtleties and non-subtleties, each action triggers an equal or opposite "reaction"; nothing the Law of Thermodynamics would n't tell you anyway, but to see it occur and applied in real life moralistic ways can have a more profound effect on understanding how it relays real life to the world of physics. <br/><br/>If not definitively taking sides on any particular school of philosophy or politics (another very fine quality of Breaking Bad is its obvious ambiguity throughout, allowing each viewer to identify with it in their own way, or perhaps keeping them open minded to possible alternatives), it certainly puts many of them up to the test. In this random, pointless world where so much is up to a matter of chance versus one's "free will", there is a nihilistic sense to Walter's life, but then again through "free will", it is clear that Walter's decisions set in motion (Inertia) events that would have been preventable and were not random but instead actual effects of his cause. Similarly, small moments about the legality of drugs and how the law changes in time create political fodder that even goes into Libertarianism. The point is that Breaking Bad has much to say under the meticulous, carefully intertwined and intricate epic crime drama saga. <br/><br/>These layers upon layers combined with its artistic, superficial attention to detail consume the viewer to create an experience seldom matched. Like the meth its protagonist cooked up, the creators of Breaking Bad cooked up something so unique, detailed and interesting that it became an addiction, and the greatest television drama of all time. AMC's "Breaking Bad" is a crime show focused more on the characters than on the crime. Crystal Meth smuggling and dealing isn't the focus, its how certain men and women evolve over the course of drastic changes placed upon their lives. Bryan Cranston delivers a powerhouse performance for all five seasons as Walter White, a chemistry teacher who ends up becoming a powerful drug lord with the help of his ex-student Jessie. What's brilliant about this show is how we get a strong look at the modern American family who end up having to deal with the male leader's decisions. Every episode manages to leave you engaged from both the twists and turns that are produced from the engrossing stories, but also from the state that the producers and writers ground us in beautifully. They manage to have audiences experience how people change over the course of many years, while simultaneously entertaining he hell out of us with extreme plot twists and phenomenal performances that rip through us like a roller coaster. Watching this show for long periods of time is one of the most enjoyable entertainment experiences of my life, and it will be for you too. As a convicted cinephile, as someone who loves the 7th art and and treats cinema as a part time job I would never expect to be doing my first IMDb review on a series. Then again, for me, this levels up to Tarantino's Pulp Fiction or even Francis Ford Coppola's Godfather.<br/><br/>This is an astonishing series, by far the best drama ever created by the industry. The pace is absolutely breathtaking, the plot thickens episode after episode and the characters' magnetism is simply extraordinary, as if each of them was "handcrafted" to please those who love cinema. Bryan Cranston was apparently not the first choice for the paper but he fits like a glove in the different stages of Walter White. Aaron Paul had to have been a Jesse Pinkman in another life seeing the way he gets inside his own character. Anna Gunn, as Skyler, makes you change your feelings towards her character, from love to hate, numerous times during the series. RJ Mitte turns an ordinary "it's just the kid" character into a monumental performance during his 5 seasons as Walter Jr. Also a quick word for Giancarlo "Gus Fring" Esposito, bow down ladies and gentlemen for he is, in absence of proper words, splendid.<br/><br/>Do not, in any case, leave this series unseen, you will be missing the most pure (I dare to say beautiful) drama / crime ever. A huge "Thank You" to Vince Gilligan for bringing us this amazing methamphetamine rush. I usually do not watch TV, and I happened to catch the first episode of Breaking Bad while flipping channels. After watching the first episode I was completely hooked. For me, there are only a few TV shows which can do that. I was lucky to catch the first episode from the beginning. For the ones who missed, the first season DVD is out now. Go buy it.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad is a dark psychological drama (although actually it doesn't really fit into any genre easily..) with some great moments of equally dark humour. Right now, I think it is different from anything else on TV. The story line is certainly nothing that has ever been done before. It is all original.<br/><br/>The cast are all exceptional and the casting is spot on. Bryan Cranston is absolutely brilliant portraying average middle class dad, Walt. He plays it so numb, then breaks bad with such force. Excellent performance from an excellent actor. Similarly, as Walt's former student Jesse, Aaron Paul shows what a great actor he is. This also goes for Dean Norris who I last saw him in Starship Troopers, long time ago. He does an outstanding job as Hank.<br/><br/>Overall it is definitely great television... and is incredibly addicting. Vince gilligan is genius bryan cranston is a monster who is thinking about this comidian actor is gonna be the greatest actor in TV history Thanks to everyone worked in this show you made a great show in history (Flash Review)<br/><br/>And not for the obvious reasons. This show is so fantastic because of Scene Structure! Most every scene is like a brief vignette with a clear start, middle and end. To break it down further; the start addresses the tension point, the middle acts out how the characters portray their perspectives on the point and the end resolves the point. Thus, after each scene the story progressively builds on itself nicely with no wasted fodder. The Shield and Barry Lyndon first come to mind with those effective screenplay structures. Layer on top of that structure, stellar acting, compelling scenarios with highly memorable moments, clever plot twists, honest tension with rather believable characters, you get a masterpiece. Go read the plot from many other places. I wanted to touch on a lesser yet import topic here. Breaking Bad is a magnificent,outstanding and completely original television series that is filled with fantastic character development,action and an endless amount of highly intense and un-forgetful scenes .The series starts off fairly promising,and then as it continues it just gets better,over the course of five years,it never a goes downhill,and there isn't a single bad episode in the whole series.I think people were skeptical when the series first came around about the the dad from Malcolm in the Middle starring in a drama,but Bryan Cranston delivers an exhilarating performance in this,Walter White is nothing like Hal and thus proves that Cranston's range is amazing and he truly is a great actor,the change in Walter over the course of these five seasons proves that.But Cranston shouldn't have all the credit,no actor in this show comes across as unprofessional,but the outstanding actors have to be Anna Gunn,Aaron Paul,Dean Norris,RJ Mitte,Betsy Brandt,Bob Odenkirk,Jonathan Banks,Giancarlo Esposito,Charles Baker,Matt Jones,Jesse Plemons and Krysten Ritter are all some of the series best characters and incredible actors and they all deserve so much credit for making this's series so great,and of course,Vince Gilligan,for his incredible writing and directing skills,this show would be nothing without him.My favourite characters of the entire series are without a doubt Jesse and Mike,their personality are something that really appeals to me,and their development over the course of the series is very pleasing,I loved Walter as well,but I never felt like I could relate to him,not that I would want to.All in all,Breaking Bad is a fantastic series,it never disappoints and I would recommend it to everyone.<br/><br/>Walter White (Bryan Cranston),a highly intelligent high school professor,joins the crystal meth business using his amazing skills in science to create a high quality and addictive product,after he learns he has lung cancer and wants to make enough money for his family to use when he's gone. There are no superlatives left in the English language that have not been showered on this series, it has won almost every award it possibly can and deservedly so.<br/><br/>Bored of the usual drab I started watching Breaking Bad almost from the beginning after reading a favourable review of the pilot. A few episodes later I was telling people this was the best drama I have ever seen. Don't you mean of late I kept getting asked. Erm no, THE BEST EVER!! Ah come on, ER, Sopranos, The Wire etc etc.<br/><br/>2 Years later everybody was on the same page.<br/><br/>With the series drawing to a close I watched the whole series again from the beginning. The astonishing thing is that not only is it as good as I remembered but each and every episode is a classic. Believe me, you cannot sit down and say this is the stand-out episode of the show. At least a dozen of them would get onto any list of the best episode ever.<br/><br/>If you have never watched it, you're an idiot and put it on your bucket list. If you have, watch it again, second time around it's even better because you know what this innocent, mild-mannered teacher is about to become a few seasons down the line!!! This review is simply an opinion of how I perceive Breaking Bad. Others may not have the same thoughts, but someone out there must agree. I am a reviewer that is normally not interested in television shows in comparison to movies. This is how I feel about Breaking Bad. <br/><br/>Breaking Bad is widely considered the greatest show on television. This would be a sufficient ranking if said before the latest seasons (4,5). This is not to say that the first 3 seasons were below par, but rather that adding season 4,5 to the mix puts the show on another level. Never have I suffered this much waiting between episode showings. Every episode has me on the edge of my seat, and leaves me wanting more and more. Knowing that the 5th season will be its last practically leaves me in tears. I know I am not the only one who feels this way, but I felt the need to write my first review ever about the show that got me interested in television again, and will forever be my personal favorite. After hearing about the god-like quality of Breaking Bad for months I decided I would watch it after I received all five seasons as a gift.<br/><br/>Seeing all the hype everywhere and seeing it being given the title of "GREATEST TV SHOW OF ALL TIME" over and over again I was eager to begin.<br/><br/>Season one is quite a disappointment. Simply put, it does not live up to the hype. One IMDb reviewer put it best by describing the entire first season of Breaking Bad as a pilot season, as opposed to the single typical pilot episode. This view I felt was incredibly accurate. The entire first season doesn't seem to have any real sense of direction, nothing much happens, and I was left feeling that the show was still a baby that hadn't learned how to walk or talk yet. After seven episodes, a show should be clearly defined - this was not. I told people how I felt and they cried "Oh no it gets better I promise you! Keep watching!" And I did...<br/><br/>Season two gets better - the plot being more entertaining than the first season - yet I still wasn't loving the show like I felt I should. It just felt so sluggish. Episodes were crammed with dull breakfast scenes and the oh-so-awful scenes with Walter Junior (Flynn?) in them. Again, reporting back to my friends, I was told "Don't stop! You're just getting to the good bit!" So I kept watching...<br/><br/>Seasons three and four were, on the whole, better than the first two seasons. But, I felt the show was making some incredibly silly mistakes. The two Mexican twin brothers? REALLY?! Talk about the most stereotypical antagonists ever. I seriously cringed when I saw them. Gus was far superior in every element and did this show some justice.<br/><br/>The fifth season is when I began really loving the show. And simply put: that is unacceptable. For a show to only become truly phenomenal in its final season does not warrant the title of "GREATEST TV SHOW EVER". I honestly did find the final season to be captivating, and I finally was eager to watch the next episode after finishing one. But this all came far too late. Countless hours of feeling mediocrely satisfied and nothing more undermined the capacity of this show to be the greatest TV show of all time. But then again - I do firmly believe no show can ever earn that title. "Greatest TV show of ITS time" is perhaps a more appropriate crown, but it most certainly does not sit upon the head of Breaking Bad.<br/><br/>A note on the characters: <br/><br/>Skyler was fantastic. The transformation she goes through from the first season to the final one is remarkable and she absolutely aided the show in its quality.<br/><br/>I did not love Jesse. He was entertaining, sure, but I couldn't appreciate him or love him like some did. His stupid choices made it impossible for me to grow to like him.<br/><br/>Hank was an expertly written character. I much preferred the interactions between Hank and Walt to that of Jesse and Walt.<br/><br/>I had mixed emotions concerning Walter. I didn't particularly like his character, but - just like Skyler - the transformation Walt undergoes is simply incredible. Comparing him from the first season to the final season he is a totally different person: a changed man.<br/><br/>TL;DR - This show is great; excellent, even. But it was not, is not, and never will be the "GREATEST TV SHOW OF ALL TIME". The reason for this is that the show does not actually become great until seasons three and four, and it is only truly enthralling by the final season. One cannot surely hope to christen something with such a title that one has to sit through hours of mediocrity before the greatness finally comes. My friends said it best: "Oh but you can't stop yet! You're just getting to the good bit!". That is entirely the issue: it should ALL be good, and it is not. I shouldn't need to watch two seasons before I finally start enjoying it.<br/><br/>Also, the hype and people who christen this show the greatest of all time really do ruin it for people who come into the show expecting perfection, upon which it fails to deliver. The hype ruins this show without a doubt and prevents it from ever being anything more than great. <br/><br/>It is absolutely worth watching, but please do not expect it to live up to the hype - it does not. It is the most OVERRATED show of ITS time, not the greatest.<br/><br/>*UPDATE* I failed to address one important aspect in my review of Breaking Bad: the acting. The acting is stellar, particularly by Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul, Dean Norris and Anna Gunn. They all did a terrific job, all of the time. If this review concerned acting alone, I'd give it a 10/10.<br/><br/>*UPDATE 2* Upon watching the entire series again, I cannot deny that season 5 is absolutely brilliant. I truly loved it. Also, I can confirm that Walter Junior is the single most hateable character in television history.<br/><br/>A new criticism: the show occasionally ventures too far from realism. In season 3, what on earth was with that intro scene where the two twin brothers crawled along the dirt road to a house with candles inside and a sketch of Heisenberg? It was never addressed or explained at all.<br/><br/>With the finale episode: I have watched the coffee scene several times and at no point does Walter have the opportunity to give Lydia the Ricin poison. Also, he is shot in the side - by whom? Certainly not his machine gun as the bullets all fired well above his level. These are just a couple of plot holes I spotted upon viewing the second time around. Breaking bad is one of it's kind. Perfect story ,perfect way to show the story. Perfect acting ,perfect directing. Great ending. I can watch this series again and again and it will stay the best. I recommend people to stop wasting their time and watch the most perfect series of all time in my opinion. Thanks Vince for this amazing show and i hope every creator to learn from breaking bad. Also, Bryan was absolutely stunning and he was perfect for the role ,Anna gunn deserved the Emmy And all the casting crew was great.Also,the choosing of characters is brilliant. PEOPLE !!! Don't miss this show, it's the best. It's 10/10 perfection. 10/10 FORSURE! Usually there isn't much you can say about a TV show. Usually it sucks or it's great. But with Breaking Bad, there isn't much you can't say. It's absolutely 100% brilliance. For viewers out there who have never seen an episode of Breaking Bad, be prepared to sit at the edge of your seat throughout the entire 5 seasons. Forsure, there are a lot of TV shows out there, and some too alike. But when watching Breaking Bad, it's a whole new experience. It's almost like it's not even TV its just a really long movie or a real life experience; re told..with a lot more excitement. There is no proper classification for it's genre. Nor is it a drama or a comedy or even a thriller. It's just Breaking Bad. The creators and directors completely broke bad, and changed our entire way of watching TV. <br/><br/>Every person on this earth should have the opportunity to watch Breaking Bad. I am a regular IMDb fan and user, and daily check the ratings of my favorite shows. Breaking Bad being my favorite show, I am always glad to see that it maintains such a good average of 9.4/10. That is phenomenal! Even more glad am I too see that it had spiked to 9.5/10, which is even better! It deserves that...and more! Right now, Breaking Bad is tied with Planet Earth, both at 9.5/10. I hope to see one day, Breaking Bad reach the score of 9.6. It deserves it 100%. <br/><br/>I watch a lot of TV, not because I'm lazy, but because it's so intriguing and I love reviewing and rating the shows. With that said:<br/><br/>Without a doubt, Breaking Bad is the best show ever created.<br/><br/>Thanks to all the producers and directors and especially Vince Gilligan for creating Breaking Bad. Walter White and his fanatic undertaking of the meth industry, will forever be in our hearts!!<br/><br/>10/10 Any day of the week!<br/><br/>HEISENBERG FOR THE WIN! The very best program on TV. This is the first time I have ever felt it necessary to write a review for anything on IMDb. I think that it's safe to say that I was ecstatic with the first episode of the new season after the end of the writer's strike. I hadn't given my hopes up until I saw the second season and some continuity despite the strike, my hopes wouldn't have been given up in vain.<br/><br/>The key to making watchable entertainment is with good writing but the key to making GREAT entertainment is to design characters the audience can relate to no matter how morally ambiguous his actions. Breaking Bad not only does this in dramatic and broad sweeping fashion but with the quality and attention to detail normally reserved for doctoral dissertations. This is certainly Mr. Gilligan's opus.<br/><br/>In Walter White (Bryan Cranston) we find an educated and reserved hero forced into a roller coaster of self-discovery in which the very core tenants of our western traditions in life, morality and human rights are not only touched upon but exhumed, aerated and critically deconstructed. Why, when, how, and for how long? What are the limits of our humanity? For what would we be so compelled as to take the life of a stranger? In Walter White we see exemplified, the most timid of soul we would think least likely to violate the rules of society that bind us.<br/><br/>On top of this delving into the deepest of the shell that is man, we add great acting, striking reality and masterful writing. I love a concrete story without loose ends, this show pays off.<br/><br/>This show, for me, is truly compelling in that I'm compelled to watch every new episode, a first. Vince Gilligan shows how big a piece of "The X-Files" and "The Lone Gunmen" was his with "Breaking Bad" - quite a large chunk, as it turns out. He has a rare gift for getting the best performances from his players, and in "Breaking Bad" he and Bryan Cranston chop some serious wood.<br/><br/>I've been following the series for four weeks now, and my wife and I just watched the most recent installment of the series ("Grey Matter") together - the first time she's seen the series at all. And her reaction was not entirely unexpected.<br/><br/>It's like chocolate - some folks like their chocolate light, some of us like it bitter-dark. I happen to be one of those serotonin junkies who like chocolate dark enough that there are special numbers to measure how dark it is.<br/><br/>And "Breaking Bad" is Special Dark Comedy. I don't think it's writing a spoiler to repeat what the network discloses in their own television commercials, so I'll explain what I mean by that. Bryan Cranston, better known before this series as the hopeless bungler of a dad in "Malcolm in the Middle," totally convinces as a high-school chemistry teacher (in a job way below his intellectual gifts - he's a serious, research-quality chemist) who must cope with a second job at a car wash under a bastard of a boss who treats him like a serf, a controlling wife, a son who he loves desperately who has a middling-severe case of cerebral palsy... and lung cancer that has already spread throughout his body, thus a very short life span.<br/><br/>As you might expect, this is a man with a lot of anger, and given his situation you can't blame him. He also has a bastard HMO who won't pay for the therapy that might save his life (I mean, gee, that would actually "maintain health," and you can't expect that of a "health maintenance organization," at least in my own experience of dealing with cancer and an HMO at the same time).<br/><br/>Another cross this man must bear is a gruff, well-meaning bear of a brother-in-law who is a DEA agent, and takes the protagonist on a "ride along" as he directs the take down of a meth lab. Our terribly ill chemist sees the lab, knows the chemistry involved (if bikers and gang bangers can make it, how difficult could the synthesis be for a REAL chemist?)... and he sees the sort of money it would take to buy a house in a decent neighborhood for cash lying around and learns that this is nothing exceptional in the world of play-for-pay amateur amphetamine cookery.<br/><br/>At this point the protagonist decides not to accept his fate meekly, not to let his wife and son exist in poverty after he dies slowly and expensively... and takes the step which Milton and Shakespeare and Goethe all have THEIR protagonists make - away from acceptance, toward stepping out of his assigned role as humble victim. And thereby hangs a great tale.<br/><br/>To do them credit, the series creator Gilligan and his associates decide not to sugarcoat the choices and consequences involved in the protagonist's decision to step out of the path leading to the poorhouse for his family. Nor do they confer sainthood or omniscience on the central character of the story. He screws up by the numbers, not least by who he decides to choose as his partner in his new career as methamphetamine cook (a choice which lends a number of seriocomic twists to the story).<br/><br/>The series is, by turns, absurd, tragic, touching, howlingly funny, bitterly sad... it fulfills Robert Heinlein's definition of art - "inflicting pity and terror on its audience." More you cannot ask. Watch it if you like your comedy very, very dark. I loved the show, i watched it like 6 times already. So good. Don't you think twice if you haven't watched, start now. Amazing show, great acting, awesome plot. I gave 9 points because i didnt like the last season as much as the other ones. Also i dont understand why everyone hates skyler, i actually liked her, she was trying to do the best for her family. Everything about this show is perfect. The cast, the acting, the plot, EVERYTHING!
I'm still not recovered from Season 5. It was an absolute masterpiece.<br/><br/>Thank you, Walter White and Jesse Pinkman for being the best duo in the history of TV.<br/><br/>You'll never watch a show that will be the same as this masterpiece. Never. One of the best seeres ever and walter wiht is the best character in any series How in the heck did I never consider watching this when it was first out? But, better late than never because I got to watch it with my now and forever love and we are obsessed! We finished it a few days ago and him and I have been having crazy BB dreams lol. We then watched El Camino and that was very well-made also. I am now re-starting season one, I just can't get enough and I just can't let it go. This show was phenomenal and very well written. There are not enough words on how to describe the series. Maybe, fantastically, jaw-dropping, insane! I will say this, there's never been a character's death that has affected me so much like Hanks. Maybe Mufasa from Lion King. I cried as if it were my dad who passed. This is absolutely the best tv series.After watching this i actually couldnt watch any tv series. I have rewatched it 6 times....and it is the greatest series in the history of tv . All the hype of breaking bad is true, and if you watch it you will know. You cant think of anything else and most importantly "you will never be the same". "This is the greatest show ever made" - said 5 minutes into every time a breaking bad spontaneously appears in front of me, without fail. When you will watch the series you will come to know why its "World's No 1 Series". Just a masterpiece. You better watch it. Amazing perfect i dont know what more to say
avery season is very good This show is best show of all time. don't miss it otherwise you would regret after. 10 out of 10. Simply put, this is the greatest show I have ever seen. If you haven't started it yet and are still unsure, believe the hype. OK, so a show about an underachieving, middle-class family man deciding to sell Meth with a drop out student of his doesn't sound like the formula for the best TV show in history, but you'd be surprised what a little psychotic alter-ego can do to a man who secretly wants to be king (albeit a meth-king).<br/><br/>The performances, writing, directing, camera work etc are all sublime. It all culminates in creating a world of characters with so much depth, so much attention gone into them that so many of them will surely go down as iconic. What separates this show above all else for me is how all 5 seasons really do feel like one long episode. There are no continuity errors, everything is meticulously planned, even the smallest throw away line or action will come back to haunt someone later on.<br/><br/>Some episodes are slow and some episodes feel like you're watching a bomb go off in slow motion, but the payoffs in this show are like nothing else in TV history. I could binge watch my way through this show again tomorrow...you know what, I just might! One of the best series of all the time. We don't have a lot of series with the same quality in every episode, in breaking bad, every episode we will watch somethig that important for the story. We won't see a serie same like this one. The middle-aged male teacher, who is poor and down-to-earth, with his genius and courage to see the dead as the end, has made an exciting career of poison teacher under the surface of a quiet life! Full of tension plot, natural and appropriate interpretation, full score work. This series has got it all. From the incredible story build up to the unbelievably amazing character development , it has managed to capture the hearts of every single viewer. You definitely will not feel the same after watching it because of the extremely strong attachment you'll feel with the main characters. The show has one of the best and just strongest transformations of a main character ever made by a T.V series. With many great shows like GOT failing to end the show on a good note , Breaking Bad has managed to have a decent ending that gave its audience closure. This show just ranks on top in every single aspect there is. I have watched many other shows in my life including The Sopranos, The Wire, Game of Thrones, etc. but no other show is done as masterfully as this. This is a perfect tv show. I can not find one single flaw with the story telling or the acting in this show. The thing I love most about this show is that the writers understand that you do not need to have every episode be an intense, insane, ten out of ten masterpiece. The slow build of character throughout the first few seasons with huge moments sprinkled in with the episodes make for one of the greatest endings of a show ever. The last season of this show is incredible. And this is coming from someone who adored Gus Fring and was livid when the show killed him at the end of Season 4. The show outdid itself time and time again. Absolute perfection. Like all TV shows took a while to get going the first 2 seasons are mainly back story telling and character building but series 3 and onwards are where it really excels, you'll be shocked, you'll cry and you'll laugh at some truly mind blowing episodes that makes it one of the best shows ever to appear on our screens Top top series. And I don't usually watch TV... Acting 10/10. Cast 10/10. Writing 10/10. A brilliant show from start to finish. It's intelligent and character driven, displaying beautiful arcs in ways that often leave viewers feeling emotionally conflicted. It makes decisions that you convince yourself it won't make, ties together loose ends appropriately, and understands the importance of remaining true to characters. It would like be a full 10/10 if I didn't find Walt so unbearable. Amazingly beautiful where each character has been portrayed so well. Best TV show i've watched in my life. I recommend this show to everybody. So it took me years (yes I know, I know), but I have now completed at 62 episodes of this awesome show. I know that I am the last person on the planet to watch this, but if for some reason, you haven't seen it, or if you are bored, nothing on TV. Get this onto a TV set near you.
So back to the start and a quick walk through of the concept. So in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Walter White (played by Bryan Cranston), a normal standard high school chemistry teacher, has just celebrated his 50th Birthday. Generally this is a joyous and happy time, but mixed in with this, Walt, gets the awful news that he has terminal Cancer days after. His wife Skyler (played by Anna Gunn) is also pregnant with their second child, their first child is Walter White Jr. (played by RJ Mitte) who is a handicapped teenager. This news rocks the family. Walt is lives a normal (boring) life compare to Brother-In-Law Hank Schrader (played by Dean Norris), who is a D.E.A. agent and married to Skyler's sister Marie Schrader (played by Betsy Brandt). Hank invites Walt to come on a sting with him. The sting is a Crystal Meth Lab, while sitting in the car watching the D.E.A. do their jobs, Walt spots someone coming out of the next door neighbours window. This is local Crystal Meth dealer Jesse Pickmann (played by Aaron Paul), a former student of Walt's.
Walt keeps this information from Hank and chooses to go to Jesse's house to discuss the possibilities of using his "skills" as a "chemist" to go into business with Jesse to make money for his family, for after his death, as they are not very well off. The story then continues. You will see ups, downs, further downs, even further downs, a few ups, a lot more downs and a few ups. You will see exactly what i mean. You will hate characters, then love them, the be happy for them, then sorry for them. That is a whole host of characters, not just 1 or 2.<br/><br/>Excellent Cast, Story-line, Script, Director, so on and so forth
Have i told you yet that you should watch this! sure i have somewhere! if you have watched then watch again! it is seriously that good. It has an average of 9.5 on IMDb, which is an amazingly high score. I think that is too low! I have given this a 10! I watched it for 5 times, 3 times on german and 2 times in englisch! The Worlds best serie The headline is personal, so here's nothing left for you to read about as a review but thank you for reaching the last word This show is breathtaking.<br/><br/>The writing, the character development, the cinematography, the music, the acting. It's so perfect it feels like they released the show took feedback off the fans and then went back in time to release a perfected version! You literally couldn't make it better.<br/><br/>The way it escalates and continues to get better is so impressive and the ending my lawd if you haven't watched it 3 times you need to watch it 3 times and then another 3 times Absolute masterpiece... Hands down the best tv series ever!!! Amazingly perfect.. Loved it.. Acting and script nailed.. The whole thing is absolutely stunning! got stuck in the story so much, the characters get so own that They become emotions for a long time. running out of words to praise i guess. Loved it! Since we (South Africa) are in lockdown due to coronavirus pandemic, i watched this series for the 3rd time and enjoyed it even more, sitting thru the entire 5 seasons in one go...shed a tear listening to ''Baby Blue'' by Badfinger at the very end, one of my favourite songs and very appropriate. Best show I've ever watched, nothing comes close. The writing in this show is really what makes it stand out. The character development is the best I've seen Story revolves around a character named walter white, a teacher in a university, who lost his financial prowess because of the schemes developed by his partners, although he was the key figure in that research, and later on, is diagnosed with cancer, he then wants to leave his family a good sum of money for their future and takes on this trip with him partner and ex student of the college he used to teach named Jessie.<br/><br/>A very good watch, it explains us the way of human thinking and the results attached to them, had high expectations that definitely didn't go to waste, a worthy watch! This is one of those shows that is so much like the subject matter, in that it is as addictive as meth. Do NOT start watching if you have anything important to do soon because you will be compelled to binge it and there are many seasons. Breaking Bad is the Best TV show ever!
Vince Gilligan is a genius. Thank you man.
And the actors are amazing, specially
Brian Cranston.
Thank you all! A great series, especially the first, fourth and fifth parts .. There is some boredom in it, but it is worthy that one is following it carefully. Great show
Every season better than the last.
Finale is perfect Breaking the old framework, the law and committing crimes to do crazy things that a dull person can't do. However, these things are just to continue the middle-class life of the family after death. The responsibility of rules and obligations is still deep in the marrow. How can we be a person who lives for ourselves, or how can we live? Just wanted to say that I'm very lucky that in my teen hood my eyes got blessed with this epic show. I've seen this show about five years ago and ever since I've been watching it in repeat every year.
You can't get enough of it. It's the most perfect show ever made and trust me I've seen alot of shows. no one is even close to this one. Please do yourself a favor and watch this if you haven't already. I love this show to the core of my heart.
Watched it within 6 days..addicted.
Since game of thrones this is the best show ever made in the history of television. I usually don't watch TV series and everyone I know says I missing out onit. One of my friends told me to start by watching breaking bad and I thought I'd give it ago. I was abit late because this series ended in 2013. So I binge watch the whole 5 seasons in 1 week and I'm so glad I did. All I can say is "PERFECTION"
You cannot get a better script or storyline better than this. Advice watch it if you haven't already. Now I can't wait to watch Saul on call and El Camino. 'Breaking Bad' is The Greatest Show In The History, period.
Brilliant storytelling, stellar cast, well tied plot and amazing charactes building.
Engaging drama that would let you forget the world outside. Yes, it is the best. Period. My first series turns out to be my best series ever.... amazing screenplay, worth watching👌🏻 Watching Walt evolve throughout the series is pretty phenomenal. Same with Jesse. I absolutely love the character development throughout this series.<br/><br/>The contrast amongst the characters between season 1 and 6 is black and white. The show shows in great detail how bad and selfish decisions in life can impact the lives of everyone around you. The storytelling is amazing though because in the beginning the audience can really empathize with Walt, yet by the end as he evolves the audiences perception evolves as well.<br/><br/>The actors, especially Bryan Cranston, deserves all the awards received throughout the runtime of this show.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad is a 10/10 with great rewatch ability I learnt to appreciate BB series even more after I finished watching the first season of GoT. I couldn't push myself to continue to the 2nd season. BB made all other TV shows all so disrespectful to audience.<br/><br/>BB ... You will be missed ... But the legend continues with Better Call Saul Breaking Bad is an all-round, excellent show. From start to finish, it keeps you interested and doesn't disappoint. Perfectly wrapped up at the end! You read it right. This show just blew me away. I wasn't even a huge TV show fan. I would peek in from time to time on popular shows for some good entertainment, but none of them hooked me. It was just something I would do when I was bored.<br/><br/>Then came Breaking Bad. I got lucky. One night, about six years ago or so, maybe seven, I was watching a classic movie on AMC- I think it was Goodfellas or Gladiator- one of the ones they always show. The credits went to black and I was expecting another movie in the lineup. Instead, I saw a unique shot in the desert and a Winnebago barreling through with some khaki pants flying through the air, as it revealed a guy in a gasmask driving it in his underwear with another guy passed out.<br/><br/>At first I thought it was another 90s Hollywood movie, maybe something in Vegas like Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas or something quirky like that, but then I realized it wasn't. I had no idea what it was- I had never seen this "movie" before. But I couldn't stop watching. Soon, there was a commercial and I realized it was a TV show.<br/><br/>And let me tell you...what came next was literally the best and most well spent TV/movie viewing hours that I had in the better part of two decades. What went onto occur blew my mind at every turn. The genius and brilliance in the subtleties and acting that came forth was unbelievable.<br/><br/>I barely left my room for three days as AMC was running a marathon on what is now widely believed to be the greatest show of all-time, but I had no idea about that then. All I knew is that I couldn't stop watching and felt like I was addicted to it....Just so intriguing, beautiful, real, amazing, and shocking.<br/><br/>Then came late season 4 and season 5, and I was speechless. It's not that seasons 1-3 weren't great, but when late 4 and 5 arrived, I practically jumped out of my couch and lost it. I was not expecting anything like that, but it was hands down some of the greatest filmmaking I had ever seen going back to the 70s. Honestly, words just cannot describe it. All I can say is this is the greatest show of all time. Enjoy. I used to think Game of thrones was the greatest show ever made ...but then I watched BREAKING BAD . That's it . The journey of walter white turning into heisenberg is really amazing.. it's the best show in the history of television tbh If you want to experience a true work of cinematic genius that only comes around once every 10 years, then indulge in the great Breaking Bad. You will never be the same or see the world (especially the world of cinema and filmmaking) the same ever again. No other television show even comes close, and neither do movies. Late to witness it, and u regret it.Well i quit gym for this whole week to complete it, among going to office and all I only got few hourse which i spent on it. Quite addictive. Character of Walter White will be remembey whole life.It affects you personally.It is entertaining , exciting and interesting every episode that you wanna spend your whole day on it. Performances and some dialogues are top notch. Screenplay is brilliant. Don't miss this at all. Gosh my uncle suggested me to watch breaking bad and this is my 4th drama series i have watched, and i fell in love watching it! i suggested it to my friend who too loved it! the pacing, the writing, the acting everything is on point! just love it! This is literally my favorite show of all time. Very bold and daring about the topics it talks about. The show is so truth to the topics and the characters they represent. A great revolving show with a simple idea but capable of hooking anyone to their seat irrespective of the genre you love. Moreover, very educative and informing. For the first time ever I'm writing a review, just because the impact of this show. I don't like watching episodes weekly at all, I just wait until a blu ray becomes available. Not this time ! Had to see it right away every week. Watched many very good shows like Sopranos, True Blood, Dexter but this show is on top ! The perfect match between a superb storyline, stunning camera-work and soundtrack and most of all very, very impressive actors. Never watch TV shows a second time, but this show makes the exception. Really looking forward to buy the blu rays of all 4 seasons. I hope there will be a 5th season !! I'm very critical in spending time behind the TV. But Breaking Bad was every season high quality time. I envy people who are going to watch the show for the first time...you lucky guys ! I first watched this show when it aired, based on a friends recommendation. I heard the premise, and was VERY interested. A middle aged highschool chemistry teacher dying of cancer starts making and selling crystal meth to support his family before he dies. He finds a kinship, and partner of sorts, with a former student/slacker of his, Jesse Pinkman. The first season was cut short, coming in at only 7 episodes, but the second season has the full 12. Give this show a chance, its very addictive. Walter White is a character you want to root for, but sometimes find yourself asking how you can. The pacing of the story is brilliant, as is the creepy foreshadowing of the finale all throughout the 2nd season. This isn't a typical show, with typical character... we empathize and sympathize with Walter White, and hope that in the end there is a reason for all his madness. He starts out as nothing more than a nerdy, over-qualified chemistry teacher, but by the end of the first season, he has definitely grown accustomed to his alter ego "Heisenberg", the meth kingpin of New Mexico. Obviously Walter gets himself in over his head, and thats what keeps us so interested... Season 3 starts in a couple weeks, and anyone who caught the 2nd season finale this past summer, is obviously dying to see where it goes from here! Breaking Bad has two significant problems: first, it makes everything else on TV look pale or silly in comparison; second, it's only on TV once a week (and only for a few months a year).<br/><br/>Simply put, Breaking Bad is the best serialized drama in the history of television. There is nothing to fault. The acting, the characterizations, the plots, everything is absolutely top-notch. And each week ends with a cliff-hanger that makes you wish it were next week already so you can see the next episode. I didn't know a show could be so effective for so long. Season 1 is incredible; season 2 is at least as good; and season 3 is the best season of any show ever made. Now that season 3 is over, life will not be quite right until season 4 begins. The good news: there WILL be a season 4. The bad news: it won't begin until July 2011.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this series, buy or rent the discs and watch it in order. But don't go too fast or you'll run out of episodes before season 4 starts. This series is inevitably the greatest Television entertainment that cable has to offer. The plot line is so creative you don't know what the next episode will be about. With Bryan Cranston's amazing acting ability and character, this show is incomparable and can never be recreated due to the amazing work of Vince Gilligan and his team. The dramatic affect left at the end of each episode makes you crave with wonder. The episodes show so much strength and power that the next plot line would never be thought of by the most extreme "televisionaholic" and/or critic. Each episode has a certain meaning and leaves you guessing what will happen on next week's episode. There has been rumor of the series opening a third season in March of 2010, I advise you to watch the other two seasons before starting to watch the new season because, you will be very lost. But with the time brought into watching the seasons you will be absolutely satisfied and there will not be one doubt in your mind that what you had watched was a waste of time. This is an absolute epic show! Watch it! You will be glad! In general, the acting by all in Breaking Bad is fantastic. However, the quality and range of acting by Aaron Paul is truly amazing. Bryan Cranston is getting a lot of attention, which is expected from a veteran actor with his experience. However, it's Aaron Paul's outstanding performance that demonstrates the remarkable capacity, among a new generation of actors, to reveal a world of extreme complexities and harsh realities that we find in today's America.<br/><br/>Aaron Paul's ability to bring to life these contemporary elements is the test of any great actor, at any age. Indeed, Breaking Bad brings a valuable contribution to the realm of quality Television Theater, and Aaron Paul's work here is among the finest to come forward in a long while. Bravo, Mr. Paul!<br/><br/>UPDATE: Great news! Aaron Paul has just won his first Emmy for Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Series, at the Annual Primetime Emmy Awards 2010! Congratulations Mr. Paul! ~ e 10/10 TV-Series, it's absolutely great. The acting is AWESOME! Especially by Aaron Paul and Bryan Cranston. The other actors do a good job too, but the duo is the main deal here and the most important characters of course. <br/><br/>First when i tried this show out back in spring of 2014, i could not get into it. I tried watching it but i got bored and stuff, because i kind of have A.D.D . But now i just gave it a shot not long ago, and WOAH! It's a GREAT TV Show! Straight up there in my book with the other awesome ones. I have to give it a 10/10 rating because it is just PERFECTION.<br/><br/>Thrilling TV Series, with 5 seasons full of goodies. I've heard, and I mostly agree that, season by season, the show just keeps on getting better until.... it's OVER. 10/10? 9/10?<br/><br/>Before people start bashing me with dislikes I gotta say, I watched the entire series this summer because a friend of mine recommended me as the single best TV show to date, as well I read reviews on several website recommending Breaking Bad as a must watch. By the end of the show I still don't get how or when this show got such insane amount of hype that made most people praise it as the Overlord of TV. I am not in any way saying Breaking Bad is bad, far from it, Bryan and Aaron are great actors, and the tragic plot is believable enough for me to stick with it to the end, but calling a show which only benefits from when Bryan and Aaron are around can't be called a Masterpiece. Breaking Bad isn't a masterpiece, its side characters and villain are way far from original, Walter "home time" is the pure definition of bore, as an incredible slow pace, some episodes fell meaningless to the overall point of the story, the women on this show are a disgrace as characters, one is worse than the next, etc. TL:DR - For some reason this show is highly overrated, described as one of the best shows around, but its that is just now true, at all. At best is good TV, a good drama, with a good anti-hero, a show that most of the times can figure out itself, if it should be a comedy or drama. Just don't be on the hypewagon, Breaking Bad isn't really that worth. You had better watch this moive.you will feel very funny I've seen many many movies and series and this one.. this one tops them all.<br/><br/>The acting is so heart crushingly good, the cast is amazing and born for their roles. Every character has meaning,symbolism, a story in their own right. The characters are a match made in.. hell. It's literally a perfect cast with the best acting I've seen in my life. I felt every emotion under the sun because of the performances.<br/><br/>The story is literal gold. It has so much foreshadowing, and symbolism that Its just beautiful in a sick kinda way. They will be talking about this for a century, this should be a example in film schools for how to write a story. It's so gripping, interesting and sad mixed with a million other things that make it so enticing to watch.<br/><br/>I just can't even put into words how good this series is. It's the best I've ever seen and probably will ever see. Story,acting,characters,symbolism,emotion,charisma,foreshadowing,cinematography.. its all 10/10. I highly encourage you to look at videos people make at dissecting this artwork of a series. Theres so much hidden stuff you dont even realize and its awesome.<br/><br/>Well what are you waiting for? This is the best show out there, hands down. Go ahead and watch it because all the hype you've heard about this is true. BEST SHOW EVER MADE ON TELEVISION!!! I HATED TO SEE SERIES END!!! I've rewatched every season 7 x and never seem to be able to stop watching it! I wish the show would come back! I miss Jessie!!! U ROCK!!! The creators knew when to call it quits. Doesn't drag on too long (Dexter). The ending is as close to perfect as a show gets. The plot and the characters are warm, but the inner drama is great, and the black comedy between crime and horror is full of spice. Jesse's psychological transformation is a little rougher than Walter's, whose personality literally opens up like a flower. Best TV series I have ever seen.
Thanks Breaking Bad team.. No other series is as perfect as BB,it deserve its greatness Beyond the slow screenplay the series is bomb yo... Potrays a common chemistry teacher turning out into a dark villain.. Breaking y Dkddjdjd

Sleepless nights
That's all folks. Absolutely worth watching - I've seen the entire series 3 times and it just gets better. Amazing story arc and character development. Wish I could give it 11 stars. The type of thing you'd watch and immediately think why did I finish it? Erase my memory because I wanna watch it all over again. I don't usually acknowledge television shows for their efforts but I have to say that Breaking Bad is an exception.
I genuinely do not think that there will ever be a show that can beat this show's standards, let alone having THE best ending to any show ever made.<br/><br/>Cheers to Breaking Bad, no wonder they got a million nominees and awards The show is as addictive as the blue meth Walter cooks, and yes, 99.6% pure This is hands down the best show ever made in Television history. Each and every character, situations are simply amazing. Finest piece of craftsmanship by the creators. Binge watched it twice till date.<br/><br/>From recording a panic message to ' I am the one who knocks'... The rise and fall of Hiesenberg! All bad things must come to an end The single greatest television show ever created. There is no argument and this is no opinion. It's a fact. There is nothing I can say about the excellence of this show that hasn't already been said. Good day sir. A great show especially season 4 & 5...started it after watching GOT and it did not disappoint me... The best TV series ever created. Period. I have watched every episode 5 or 6 times and always discover something new with each viewing. This show is the gold standard against which everything else can be measured. In addition to perfect casting, directing, plot, and dialog, we have those magnificent POV camera shots and perfect music. It's been over a decade now, and I still can't believe how good this is. Overwhelming, breathtaking, groundbreaking, inventive, stunning, jaw dropping. Perfection. Look, let's not beat around the bush here. This show is epic in its writing, characters, plot, cinematography, start AND finish. It takes you into a world we haven't quite ever seen before, a world where the sad and unaccomplished Walter White turns into a genius mad-man. You can see the character evolve into a selfish, power-hungry villain who you just love to hate. Vince Gilligan did an amazing job not following the lead of most tv shows out there right now. He knew how to build a story without making you feel like you are underwhelmed (or overwhelmed for that matter). And when he knew it was time for this show to end (although I felt a hole in my heart for days after the finale), he didn't care about the money or the fans or the critics, he just ended it the exact moment it was supposed to end. I have never been this invested in a tv show and I watch a lot of tv shows. Epic is the only one word you can give this show and everything about it. And NOT watching it is not an answer. If I have to pick one single best TV Series that would definitely be BREAKING BAD. Every single episode is masterpiece. Even the episode with the fly which many people cannot really understand and I don't blame them. This is one high quality story made in genius way. I recommend it to anyone who like deep, meaningful, emotional stories with many moral cases in them. BREAKING BAD is definitely story I would write a book about, like commentary. The topics in it are contemporary and eternal at the same time. Don't wait, watch it. The beat show of all time and the best ending of all time Breaking Bad is my favorite and great series ...
I advise you to see this ...
Adrenaline is needed for you ... :D If you haven't seen this masterpiece I am jealous because that means you get to see this with out fully knowing how incredible it is. Prepare to be staying up late since you will want to see the next episode. Best character development, writing and acting ever! Go watch it now, thank me later It has been said Breaking Bad is the perfect example on how to write a perfect script. That couldn't be more true. I dont know what to say but its the best tv show i have ever watched and I'd recommend u to watch it What a show breaking bad is. every season is a masterpiece and is amazing. the acting, directing, character development, plot everything is simply amazing. walter white is possibly the best tv character of all time. Not too much I can say about breaking bad except it is the best show I have ever seen. Acting - perfect, characters - realistic and ones you really care about, story - always interesting, never cliche and always moving forward, music - outstanding, cinematography - breathtaking, overall concept - one of a kind. Breaking bad is a show that everyone should see. Yeah... a masterpiece! If you never seen Breaking Bad... please, make yourself a favor, maratone this! Of course one would have to be living under a rock these past few years to not have heard about Breaking Bad. Many suggested I see it, but the idea to me was absurd to watch a mild mannered science teacher descend into the world of drug dealing, while having his soul wither away. Well, we can all be wrong, and this was a call I missed. What on earth about the above premise could make for good and entertaining television? Everything. The acting, the directing, the writing, and every damn thing associated with this phenomenal show. My husband and I watched this on a "binge", the first show we ever did this with. Aside from having to get up for work the next day, we would debate at four am....."well, one more"? It draws you in, it hooks you, it makes you care. For the "good" guys, and the "bad" guys. Which, by the way, the lines between get very blurry. I'm waiting a year or so to watch in entirety again. I'm sure there is much I missed. And I'm not the only one I know who says they could not "shake" it when the show was over. I actually got a sense of depression! "No Walter tonight". "No Jesse tonight"! Whatever will I do!! In all my years of TV watching, I've never felt that. I even would occasionally relate to a character. Upon exiting my car one morning, someone almost came up on me quickly and cold have hit me. I had to BITE my tongue not to have the words " Yo! Bitch......." fly out of my mouth. To finish, Breaking Bad was the most unlikely program I would every imagine I would consider to be hands down the best television show I have ever had the pleasure to watch. And I'm confident I'll enjoy as much, if not more, the second time around. One last note. Some reviews referenced the brilliant soundtrack --which it was. Being a 1960's music aficionado, I almost jumped at the screen when an exquisitely placed "Crystal Blue Persuasion" just came out of nowhere. But...that's perfection. Where do I even begin... first of all, Breaking Bad is the best show that will ever be made. I have seen many TV shows in my life, but none are better than this masterpiece. Bryan Cranston gives the best, most realistic acting performance I have ever seen on screen. Not just Cranston, but all the actors in this show are great. Aaron Paul, as Jesse, is phenomenal. Dean Norris as Hank is also a phenomenal character in the show. The plot is also so perfect. High School Chemistry teacher dying of cancer, resorts to cooking methamphetamine to provide money for his family when he's gone. There is not a single flaw in this entire show... the acting is great, the casting is great, the plot is great, the episodes are extremely entertaining, and it will hook you right from the start. I give Breaking Bad a 10, but it deserves a 20. I have watched this whole show twice now, and already want to watch it again. If you haven't experienced Breaking Bad, make it a priority!!! If Breaking Bad was the first TV series to ever exist, something incredible certainly would have made history. If it were to be the last show to ever run, that would make it a perfectly historical culmination. However, as it arrived eight years into the 21st Century, it ranks as a game changer for television eternally.<br/><br/>None of the films and any other TV show I've seen in my lifetime have impressed me as much as this. It's impossible to describe this series in one word but it deserves to be described with every single positive one ever created on this planet.<br/><br/>It's pretty staggering how much creator Vince Gillian and his crew beat the odds to tell a story about a man who rises to crime by cooking drugs after his cancer diagnosis. The way Walter White changes from a family guy to a money-obsessed drug lord is incredible. Okay, its subject matter obviously isn't for the faint of heart but whether you're into that or not, you'll be hooked to this thing like what that disgusting drug does to people.<br/><br/>It's not just a crime show, its more than just that. In fact there's so much to obsess over: the character development and dialogue are professionally thought-out and never cheat, the cinematography is experimental, the direction is strong and the locations are beautifully staged. The writing is by far the selling point of the series. The team of ten writers (including Gilligan) know how to keep the story moving from one moment to the next with unstoppable energy while absorbing unique ideas that never feel or become stale and derivative. They also understand how to capture the horrific transformation of a normal human turning evil unhurriedly. Kudos to the directors for translating them onto screen, which is just as impressive due to the fact that their work is so seamless that the audience can become completely unaware of it. Notable directors Rian Johnson (Star Wars: Episode VIII) and David Slade (The Twilight Saga: Eclipse) helm a few episodes which adds as a bonus to the series' success.<br/><br/>The storytelling is of the highest order. It's clear Gillian isn't a by-the-numbers storyteller, he cares about characterisation and slow introduction for the colourful and dark world he's created. From the first episode to the very last, nearly every frame roots for the beauty of character-driven narrative as well as artistic cinematography that vaguely shows the beautiful locations in the background. We care for these characters, we follow them, we relate to them in some way. To be truthful, they feel realistic throughout the entire series. If only films adapted this element better.<br/><br/>Bryan Cranston is mind-blowing as Walter White. Anchored by the writing, he sets the character up perfectly as he gets sucked into the criminal underworld. His attitude towards everyday life slowly begins to change throughout the series, and it's played beautifully. Aaron Paul is awesome as Jesse Pinkman, portraying an uneven post-student drug addict in all the best ways. He's funny, argumentative but you also oddly enough care for him in many parts of the show. <br/><br/>Dean Norris is top-notch as DEA brother-in-law Hank. He plays a little with comedic attitude throughout the first couple of seasons but that slowly fades away as the story gets darker. Anna Gunn and RJ Mitte are spectacular at wife Skyler and son Walter, Jr. They have the characteristics to support a normal family before all hell breaks loose. <br/><br/>If they're any flaws, there is perhaps only one. While the cinematography is stylistic, the first half of the series is viewed from a hand-held perspective, making the experience sometimes slightly frustrating but luckily later on it turns to the camera placement that I can handle. Without giving anything away, the finale is anything but average which is a low for the show. It doesn't have the same richness that the pilot had, but hey, you can't have everything.<br/><br/>A TV series can go on for years or maybe decades, but what this did so damn well was that it finished exactly when it needed to. In an age where shows are dragged until completely decreased quality, this is a triumph. Gilligan chose wisely.<br/><br/>Crime does not pay but Breaking Bad certainly pays the price, thanks to the indescribable and unthinkable effort of the entire production anchored by a true discovery in television: Vince Gilligan. I doubt we'll see anything like this again. Visiting IMDb forever now, but for the first time felt need to register and write something. So proud to brag around how I watched pilot episode on it's premier night, not having a clue what is it about beforehand, got hooked up on it and watched almost every episode on it's premier night including the last one. Comparison to any other contemporary TV series ( of any genre) seems simply unfair, that how much better BB is. 'Sopranos' comes close to it, except it was just new approach to old good mafia stories. BB was (uh, 'was'!) original piece on so many levels, surprising in it's story line, characters build up, shooting, cinematography and you name the rest. And you can tell it was a labor of great love, from it's creator, writers, actors and others. The best judge of all, time, will give it it's stamp one day, but for now it stands tall, head and shoulders above anything I have seen in last10-15 years. It wasn't perfect all the way, but never stumbled either,amazing for 62 episodes long show. No idea when or who is going to make something this impactful, but I am not getting my hopes high The best TV show I have seen. I'm one of the people that didn't even know about it until it had nearly ended, and I managed to watch all 5 seasons in just over a month. I had to wait a while for the last few episodes, as they hadn't been broadcast, and the wait was unbearable.<br/><br/>What at first seems like an odd plot, and certainly not one you could stretch over 5 seasons, instantly becomes an utterly fantastic TV show. It is brilliantly acted, particularly by the two main actors, Cranston and Paul. The story lines are so engrossing you won't be able to stop watching - your nights will just be a blur of constant episodes.<br/><br/>It's also one of those brilliant shows that doesn't fluctuate or get worse with the introduction of new seasons. In my opinion, the last season was the best, and the fourth the second. Fantastic characters, fantastic villains, fantastic plots. So many moments are almost too tense to watch.<br/><br/>I would recommend this show to anybody, I've told several of my friends to watch it and not a single one has not said they loved it.<br/><br/>All in all, absolutely brilliant. This is a hard show to review. The first few seasons were incredible but I feel that they dragged it out too long. As the weeks go by I found myself thinking "really, there are 5 seasons of this". I am truly diverse in my tastes and don't get offended very easily at all. I love gore, gritty, sci-fi, fantasy, comedy, romance, animation. You get the picture I really do not discriminate and instead judge on it's merits. But I found that Breaking Bad exhausted me. Five seasons of disgusting, corruption, ferralness, deplorable human behaviour took it's toll on my level of appreciation for this show. If it had been shorter I would have enjoyed it more. I know it was revolutionary and truly realistic but in the end I despised it for being great and the fact that I had to see it through to the end.<br/><br/>I know people will think I am mad for writing this but does a show that is fantastic but sucks the soul and heart out of you make for as good TV as everyone believes; or was everyone else too caught up in the hype to admit their true feelings about Breaking Bad. Hopefully there will be better series in the future, but not up till now. The GARBAGE that is Game of Thrones season 8 and the way that season ruined the entire series made me appreciate BB all anew. The best series hitherto, easily. Yes it is best tv show in the end you have a one to break and you Some years after writing for "The X Files", Vince Gilligan created a show. I only saw scattered episodes of "Breaking Bad" during its run, but I finally got around to binge-watching the first season. Bryan Cranston puts on one of the most chilling performances in TV history as a terminally ill teacher who turns to manufacturing crystallized methamphetamine to support his family. Basically, the show is about moral ambiguity and how actions have consequences. Indeed, each episode adds a new complication.<br/><br/>When I first read about the show during its run, I saw a picture of Bryan Cranston with a beard, glasses, and a shaved head. Having known him as the dad on "Malcolm in the Middle", he looked unrecognizable in that photo. But he's proved himself to be a truly versatile actor in the past few years, with roles in "Contagion", "Argo", "Godzilla", and "All the Way" (as Lyndon Johnson).<br/><br/>In the meantime, this show will offer some of the most unusual chemistry lessons. Outstanding show. It deserved every award that it won.<br/><br/>I wonder if Vince Gilligan has ever gotten comments about "Gilligan's Island". BREAKING BAD is a seriocomic study of a middle-aged man, a high school chemist teacher, on the brink of losing it over a financially poor marriage and the fact that he's leading a double life that his wife knows nothing about. As the harried man, BRYAN CRANSTON delivers a solid performance, full of realistic touches--laced with bitter humor and honesty--his superb work holding the whole episode together.<br/><br/>Seems the need for cash sets up the idea for him to consider partnership with an ex-student who deals in drug sales. After viewing a newscast showing stacks of easy money from a drug bust, Cranston gets the idea to ask his brother-in-law, a DEA agent, if he can accompany him on one of the busts. While there, he spots an ex-student escaping from the scene and hooks up with him later to propose a partnership wherein he'll make the drugs and the student will sell them.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, a visit to the doctor because of a dry cough reveals that he has lung cancer, something he doesn't want to tell his wife because she's expecting a baby. Desperate for "easy money", he gets heavily involved with the ex-student (another brilliant performance by AARON PAUL), and together they find themselves caught up in drastic circumstances with two bodies to get rid of as soon as their drug activities go awry. The sequence where Cranston lets the phosphine gas (while mixing ingredients) do the job of ridding himself of the two men in the van, is a model of suspense.<br/><br/>There's a payoff in virtually every scene, full of unexpected twists that seem credible and always true to the characters. The suspense is almost non-stop, the action scenes are briskly handled, the humor is diabolic, and the dialog is always sharp as a knife. In an amusing breakfast scene, with the wife buying things on the cheap and making substitutions, the son remarks: "This bacon tastes like band-aids." It's as dark as a black comedy can get, but played so earnestly by BRYAN CRANSTON and the cast that the viewer is immediately hooked into the story which begins with a bang. The cinematography the dialogue the location, acting the Pace of the story... everything is 110/100...just submerged in the story here Nothing recreates first time experiencing Br Ba.
An unique masterpiece..hats off Vince and team. I started this show with really no interest. But wow right after just one episode, I was hooked. The show has some of the best writing I've seen and performances! And it results in the best show ever! 10/10 This is the Best Show i have ever come across since DeathNote, the character development and the ups and downs of each character is soooo amazingly done and the story although feels slow at first , did all the justice as it escalated through the seasons. The way Walter slowly turns into Heisenberg and does things without a sign of regret and repent really shows the changes he incurred.
Also The Acting of every character in the Story is just sooo much natural and moving , i might not have seen such level of acting on any show ever , especially Anna Gun(Skyler) , Bryan Cranston (Walter) and Aaron Paul( Jesse) .
Anybody who hasn't watched it, should definitely experience this masterpiece . After all these years.. still afresh in memory and simply the best TV show ever! Honestly, when I heard of this show I didn't think I'd like it. I thought it would be a show that glorified drug use, but it was quite the opposite. It showed the dark side of addiction to drugs, money, power. Such a great show. I'm talking about the best TV show ever. It's a legendary masterpiece. We can't Compare it with any another TV show. I wish I could forget it and watch it again. All directors and authors should learn How's the drama? from it. Finally That is my favorite TV show ever. This is the best show of all times.It is absolutely a masterpiece, every season is getting better and the cast is perfectly chosen.Great work Vince Gilligan. Even its spinoff "Better Call Saul" is not as good. What separates Breaking Bad from other "good" tv series is the awesome storytelling. There are a lot of good shows on American TV, but none of them really gets it done as perfectly as BB.<br/><br/>Game of thrones is overrated garbage in comparison. A masterpiece of visual storytelling, utilizing metaphors, allusions, poetry, and symbolism to enhance the story and its trajectory in a way that is nothing short of masterful.<br/><br/>"To WW, My Star, My Perfect Silence". "WW, I figure you know who you think that is: Woodrow Wilson, Willy Wonka, Walter White?"<br/><br/>"When I heard the learn'd astronomer,<br/><br/>When the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me,<br/><br/>When I was shown the charts and diagrams, to add, divide, and measure them,<br/><br/>When I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with much applause in the lecture-room,<br/><br/>How soon unaccountable I became tired and sick,<br/><br/>Till rising and gliding out I wander'd off by myself,<br/><br/>In the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time,<br/><br/>Look'd up in perfect silence at the stars." The best in all aspects. If you are about to suggest me a series, i would say if possible just delete breaking bad from my brain, so that i can have a fresh start. after brba no series giving me satisfaction. Perfect one. Thanks Vince & team. One word PERFECTION!!!!!!!
MIND-BLOWING ONE A CLASSIC MASTERPIECE.
THE BEST SHOW NO ONE CAN COMPARE THIS MASTERPIECE TO ANY OF THE SHOWS OUT THERE. From beginning to the end. The detail and story telling is just perfect. The S3E10 'Fly ' episode is one of my favourite. Must watch. I'm sure no matter how many other tv shows you watch, you can never compare or get the satisfaction that breaking bad gives. It simply a master piece. You gonna tell to your kids, grandkids about this show. One word, Perfection. Kudos to the creators for this mind-shattering peice. I have watched so many movies and originals but this invoked me to pen down review I believe this is a toxic and very thriller masterpeice that shall keep you engaged for 48 to 49 minutes in each episode that you will be eager to hit the next episode. Breaking Bad created by Vince Gilligan, which I lately finished watching, revolves around a chemistry teacher Mr. Walter White, who actually is fighting a battle with a deadly diseases Lung Cancer, decides to cook meth (a kind of drug) in order to repay his medical debts. Things go fine until he partners up Jesse Pinkman a meth-head. This crime drama portrays the canny picture of selfishness, lust of power, revenge and self-redempation.<br/><br/>Give a try because I rate it 10/10 for writing, story, directing and importantly acting. Breaking bad is the best show ever to be made. It's so interesting and unpredictable. Make you eager to know what's gonna happen next. Perfect acting and story. Everything's perfect Storytelling the pacing the acting evrything is awesome I've watched a LOT of TV. Breaking Bad is the very best I've ever seen from start to finish. It grabs you in episode #1 and it never lets go. So many great characters, but Jesse & Walt are flawless. A perfect odd couple whose journey explores their characters in a depth I've never seen from another show. They were brilliant throughout. Breaking Bad.
Is the story of Walt White, a high school chemistry teacher working in a second job (car wash) to try to support his family. He takes a banal life, lives with his pregnant wife and his teenage son, who has cerebral palsy and have locomotive difficulties. Desperately hard up for money and constantly put down by those around him, Walt reaches the breaking point when he's diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer. He connects with former student Jesse Pinkman to start making and selling methamphetamines in order to raise money for his struggling family.<br/><br/>In my opinion, Breaking Bad is the best series that exists in the film industry. The series has a writing and production by Vince Gilligan, who created a story that portrays several problems that we live in society and makes us wonder how far the madness of a desperate man goes.
The show also has an amazing actors, since Bryan Cranston, who plays the main character Walter White, representing very well all his moments of despair and insanity that the character has, that holds us every minute of the show and Aaron Paul who plays Jesse Pinkman as a supporting actor, a character who had a difficult and unlucky life manipulated by everyone around him, but with a pure and naive heart living a roller coaster of emotions through out the show very well performed by the actor. The character development is simply incredible, which makes us have a special connection with each of them and the story of the whole series is very well accomplished and does not take us out of the series at any time.
I have repeated the show several times, all the episodes are good and I have never regretted watching it. Thanks to Vince Gilligan, AMC and everyone who participated in the realization of the series for the excellent work they have achieved. 10 STARS The PERFECT series. That is all that needs to be said. This show is a mix bag because i can understand the people who are leaving negative comments like "slow paced OR boring" but trust me this show knows it as well, it may look boring and dull at first but its the part where u are introduced to characters, little backstory. Its essential to the story, once you do get hooked onto it, you end up wanting more and MORE like drugs. This is so well written and perfectly executed that its almost crazy.<br/><br/>This series has inspired so many spin off's / movies, i mean its a decade old and still one of the best on my list. I have nothing to say. This is the best TV show that I have ever seen. When I first started this show I was worried it would be overrated and there was no way it could live up to the praise it has received. I was wrong. From the very first episode until the very last this show had me completely enthralled. Never a dull moment or a pointless scene. 10/10 without a doubt. Just unimaginable, almost perfect. The acting, directing, script and everything. It was really amazing. Character development was so amazing. Aside its achievements in acting,writing and editing, the real factor that makes Breaking Bad the cult, unforgettable sensation is the character development that every character forgoes throughout this legendary show one step at a time. Eventhough there are some events that are considered to be monotone in the series,The show never stops rewarding the viewer in its modern Surf tone. I have never done reviews but I just have to do one for this show. This is by far the best show i've seen and im sure this will be the best show i will ever watch. Im sure every other show u will watch after BB will be boring and not good for you. I wish i could destroy my memories and watch this show again. From the story to the every little detail is made just perfect. If you are changing your mind to watch or not watch this show...dude just watch because it is an art and you wont regret it i believe it. Masterpiece, takes a bit time to relate and fully appreciate Perfect, that's the right word to define this show, all of it is just... Perfect, the characters, the script, all the plots are mindblowing, just make yourself a favor and watch this, because it's so perfect that it's almost a sin not to watch it. The best TV series I've watched (not counting mini-series, that goes to Band of Brothers). The writers really did amazing work in this. You won't find many overused plotlines here. Being able to do that is an achievement, especially since the story is as absorbing as it is.<br/><br/>Not only story-wise, technically the series is also masterful. "Show, don't tell" is done so good in this series that I have to remember it's not easy to pull off, both on thinking of the way to do it and how to execute it well so the audience get it. This gives room for the actors to give amazing performances also. Instead of just hearing "Jane's dad is sad", you see it yourself. They do it so well you actually don't need to hear it anymore since it's so obvious now.<br/><br/>The road to hell is paved with good intentions. I know no other story that makes me remember that better than the story of Walter White. This is the best series in the history ever, I loved it from the beginning to the end.. From first episode to last episode its brilliant , brilliant and brilliant. only drawback of this show is that, it has ended, i hope it never ends. Everything is perfect in this show. Very engaging story.Loved it. Great cinematography, realistic scenes with well-thought out details, continuity, and accurate, accurate substance. Nothing will ever beat this show's place in my heart. This was a very well written show that keeps the viewer enthralled and guessing what will come next. The writers ability to make the characters identifiable to the viewer was uncanny. The acting and the characters were outstanding and the finale was brilliant. The last season had some of the best episodes ever for any tv series.
This show is as addictive as the drugs the show is about. I strongly recommend you watch this show as it's the best out there without a doubt.
10/10
Amazing Watching a series with lots of expectations
And it is full filled my expectations perfect storyline screenplay and acting If you are not watched this TV series yet you are lucky person cos u have great oportunities to take all pleasure from entire TV series I was stuck with GOT, then the ending disappointed me. Then I was recently watching The 100s and I really likes it till the after the second season when Clark and Abby appeared to painfully annoying and then it kept drowning.
OMG why I kept ignoring this? Thanks to my friend who made me watching the first episode, then you know, I believe you know what happened, I literally stuck with it with all of my likeliness. This is the best series I ever saw, and I dare to say it is the best series ever created, The characters by Bryan and Aaron are so perfect and the story, writing acting everything is perfect. You will love it and I know you already love it. This show is just perfect, Vince Gillian offers a fresh, brilliant, entertaining show, the guy is a genius.The show has plot twists that don't disappoint, they are so perfect that you will never forget those plot twists. The cast of the series is perfect, Bryan Cranston as Walter White is just wow, and Aaron Paul is brilliant.You will not regret watch this series. The character development fell mid-season. Walter White was never a good liar. They dragged this on for too long, but the tension made up for it. Their artistic license changed the quality of television for years to come. It's the little things, the mechanisms and techniques of simple day to day routines magnified, perfect angles and scene transitions, authentic depictions of culture, gangster or otherwise, which all add up to produce something extraordinary. Gilligan is our modern Hitchcock. Just one word, creativity without limits
Madness, enthusiasm, fun and passion So...I was a little late to this party, but not the type of late where you get there after it's over and the cops are arresting someone for indecent exspoiler! No, I went in fresh while season 3 was currently airing. Which meant I was able to avoid any major spoilers and caught up to a live season 4. And like EVERYONE else that has ever watched BB, I could not wait for the next episode. That is until the very last one, you know, that last episode where immediately following it you go into a state of panic that includeds depression, feelings of complete emptiness, a total loss of self worth and questions of how in the hell can you even go on??? Then, when you finally come to grips with the end of the world as you know it... a light goes off, and you do the one and only thing that makes any sense, the only thing that can even begin to help make you whole again, that one thing that can wake you from your television induced coma... and completley rewatch the entire series 5 more times! So if your wondering if this is a good show worthy of your time, if this is a show that can change your life, if this is a show that will prepare you for the afterlife and put you at ease knowing there is God spmewhere out there and he/she has a plan, then I'm here to say yes, you should watch this show! The main theme of the story is clear.
Excellent development of environment and characters that surround the hero, with emotional approach and identification.
There is a link of all the elements to a changing fact that helps the story to evolve. I saw a lot TV Shows. This is definitly one of the top three. Walter White is brilliant! I still searching to found something better than breaking bad but I feel tired because I don't find I never knew how much i loved the show until i finished it. Amazing. The best tv show ever. Fantastic story, good directing, great actors. Three re-watches later and it still provokes a lot of feelings. I still feel the tension as season 5 unfurls and my heart still breaks three or four times even though I know the story so well by now. To mix it up a little, "Best Lists" sometimes rank BrBa as #2 or #3 or #4 but nah, this is the benchmark. It's one of the best series I watched. It starts slowly but gets really interesting to watch and find out how it'll finish. A must watch. All actors are great. Best show of all time Wow! I just finished it. Awsome.! Outstanding acting.. Its "bad" episodes are most shows "great" episodes. I'll say that much. You'll either never laugh at Malcolm in the Middle again, or laugh that much harder. Made this account to give this show 10 rating. I have never seen anything like it before. But tv series I ever watched. Worth every second of my time spent watching it This is the best show of the decade no doubt! If you haven't seen it, it's a must! 10/10 This must be the greatest Tv show!hands down the most captivating show ever created!The hype is real.After completing this i feel like there's nothing else i can watch! Don't miss this! I never in a million years thought I'd be rooting for a drug dealer or "cook". I've never touched a drug in my life haha. Anyway, people kept bugging me about watching it and finally finished it. Always on the edge of my seat with Breaking Bad. I can't say enough about this. Just basically the nest series ever, you would never gonna watch anything better
Hardly suggesting Can't say it in words...
I can't...
All the 62 episodes...each single one...esp.s5...wow...Vince Holy Gilligan❤ I re-watch every episode and i am not bored this serie is perfect The show is beautifully written and the attention to every last detail was phenomenal. I absolutely cannot rave enough about the show. I've watched it 3 times through, even knowing the story arc it gets better every time. That really is amazing. It started of like a typical comedy and ended like the best series in history Truly I had to love the every plot and character of this series.
This is too much realistic and suspense in every episode.
Ahh. I finally saying that I love it.😍
Everybody should watch it. What more can I say but absolutely brilliant it has just about every emotion you can think of. The script is outstanding, the characters are believable. You empathize, sympathize, laugh, cry. Anyone who doesn't give this a Ten what more do you want. Greatest Show of All Time. Perfect all the way through. Great story that puts a strain on your moral compass, great acting, great execution, and a great ending to all of it, which so many shows fail at. 10/10 I swear to God, I have never in my whole life seen anything that perfect everything about the show is just mesmerising and breathtaking I've watched the show 5 times by now and still blown away by everything in it from the story to the acting everything is just freaking brilliant, the character of Walter white and his brilliant acting is literally just out of this world Very few shows seem to capture the ramifications of life's choices like Breaking Bad, at least few do it and keep it interesting. Breaking Bad isn't some gratuitous advertisement for drug use; to the contrary. Breaking Bad tells an intriguing story with fascinating characters--many likable, and a few very unlikable--unveiling the harsh reality of what greed can do.<br/><br/>I think the thing I liked about this show is how the characters develop. I don't know if I've ever been so transformed in my opinion about a character as I was with Hank (and I'll leave it at that to avoid spoilers).<br/><br/>The blend of humor and angst this show provides is almost as perfect as Walter White's recipe for meth. Anyone who might be interested in pursuing crime as a trade will probably change their mind by the end of this show.<br/><br/>The series has a very few dud episodes (like the one capturing the fly), and by the last season you truly won't be able to shut it off. I've seen stuff with great camera work, I've seen stuff with great acting, and I've seen stuff with great story, but this show combines all those things and much more to create a television experience unlike any other. I would recommend this to anyone. This series is the pinnacle of characterizations, the way it was written, made and performed is just matchless, flawless and it's far ahead from the perfection. You just need patience upto 2 seasons and the rest is an unforgettable journey. Don't miss. Just perfect, fantastic , must watch.
Disappionted when i watched the movie El Camino...missed Mr White. The most exceptional Television show of all time . Best 62 episodes of entertainment , emotions , thrill and character development television could offer ! This is the only show i've seen and its extraordinary. Everything you would want from a show really, multiplied by 100. I never took Drug, But its feel like crystal meth. When i finished watching, my feeling was like expression of Tuco, Badger, etc, when they take crystal meth with inhaling.
That Goddamn Feeling!!!!! Watched this whole series from start to finish within 2 weeks. Binge watched it most of the times.
Can't express how amazing this is. The acting, the action, everything is 100%. I have finally finsihed Breaking Bad and all I can say is wow, this is easily one of the greatest shows ever made and I loved the entire time that I watched it. The premise of the final season sees Walter & Jesse attempt to come up with a new way of building their empire to continue success. Bryan Cranston's performance as Walter White is easily one of the single greatest performances ever seen, he has so much depth to him and this season you really see the evolution of his character and how he has developed over this 5 season period and one that will be remembered for a very long time. Aaron Paul as Jesse is also amazing in his role, his character has had so much progress to him and so much character development. These two have brilliant chemistry in this show and really carry this show to one of the greatest of all time, the supporting cast is also great aswell. Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman is one of those great supporting characters, he has so much charisma and charm about him that dars you in and makes you want to like his character. Anna Gunn as Skyler White also does a really good job, her and Walter's relationship is really interesting to watch and you see how they have developed as a couple. Dean Norris as Hank in my opinion will go down as one of the greatest supporting characters in a show ever, seeing him finally try to work out what is going on is so engaging to watch and drives this season and some of the best moments of it. The story as mentioned is engaging to watch all the way through, the twists and turns that go in this season is great to watch, and I don't really want to talk about it as it is something you should experience yourself. The script is amazing the great mix of drama and humour really works and makes the characters feel really human and multi layered. The style is brutal and interesting to watch, seeing this man transition from where he was in the first episode to the last episode is amazing and something that needs to be seen. Overall this is an amazing final season for a brilliant show that will go down as one fo the greatest TV Shows of all time. The best series ever made! The script and the writing is outstanding! Bryan's and aaron's acting is out of this world. Vince Gilligan Thank you! The best show ever made. I dont think any show will come near to this level of quality work. I am confused now what to watch after finishing this. I wish i forget what i saw and again I will start watching this. Just perfect. Amazing performances by Walt, Jesse and Hank and others. The story is so addictive it's like a drug the more u watch the high u get but the series play with the user's emotion a lot...it will get u laughing at many points but sometimes it will make the user go in depression as depressing scene comes up...people can literally cry for this...the end is very much satisfying...just loved it...this story will remain in my memory as long as i live... The best show ever! Nothing can beat this!! S1-3 were the best, S4 was good but not great, s5 was perfect! Breaking bad was the second best show of all time, only behind game of thrones. However, the GOT final season was so bad that breaking bad is now on top. I'm rewatching it for the 4th time and honestly love it more and more each time. Never again will you see character development and brilliant writing like this show This was a masterpiece..I loved all the episodes and the ending was so good... the acting was perfect and all of you need to watch this show Best drama series ever made!!!hats off to all team behind breaking bad If you have not watched this , stop everything and go indulge . There isn't going be a better content than this ! This is not a show but an experience . Live it and you won't regret it . Do I really need to say more? Mature casting, effortlessly evolving characters and about the shrewdest writing you'll find on the small screen synthesise together to create a near-perfect formula. 99.1% pure. I continue watching Breaking Bad and the fourth season is easily the best one yet. The premise of the season sees Walter & Jesse trying to survive as they believe their boss Gus is trying to kill them. There isn't much more to be said about how amazing Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul are in this show as their respective characters but this season is the best work by both of them. Paul is really the main character this season and excells in adding layers to the character of Jesse Pinkman and Cranston nails the development of Walter and the change from the first episode of season 1 to the last episode of this season is absolutley huge. A huge shoutout has to go to Giancarlo Esposito who plays Gus, he is amazing in this show, he is one of the most deep and layered antagonists seen in any TV Show or film ever and is a truly memorable character. The characters of Saul, Mike and Skyler are also great this season and add to every scene that they are a part of. The story is excellent, to see how our protagonists have to deal with all these different scenarios is fascinating. I'm trying to be sparce of details so you can enjoy this great story for yourselves. The script is great, a real fantastic blend of humour and drama, the mix of likeability and intensity is there and easy to be seen which helps make complex characters. The style of the show is probably at it's most brutal this season and it highlights just how crazy the situation involving our characters has become. Overall Season 4 of Breaking Bad is a masterpiece in television and I can't wait to finish this excellent show. A gem that kept it's integrity through out it's 5 season run and ended at the top. Just watch it. The story, the cinematography, the score, directing... and last but not least the acting. Characters that changed the television. All hail the king. These series thus far have been very essential for me and people who loves a gripping and thrills series as this is one of the best TV series ever. If you love development with no continuity error, this is for you. If you like intense drama, this is for you. Everything that you would've expect from the series really delivers everything that you want. The last season of the series is the most satisfying one ever and gives closure to its main character. I have watched it twice and it stills gives me the feel to watch it again. I binged watched this series last year and never felt outdated. Brilliantly penned by Vince Gilligan. Jesse pinkman and hank are two characters I liked a lot. Hank was the true protagonist in this anti hero series. 10/10 recommend if you haven't watched it yet I would say the first season is not very catchy, it is a bit boring, but it is totally necessary for the development of the series. Each season increases the intensity and the desire to see more. I don't know anyone who has seen this series and was not amazed. Extraordinary performances by the entire cast. Best thing that ever happened to television 10/10 i watched it 5 time and i never get bored of it so amazing The best serie I've seen. It has good performances, a great script and everything a person look for in serie. I rate 10/10, I would say its an experience and must watch, I never saw anything like this before . GOT doesn't got much deserve ending but breaking bad truly well written master piece, eagerly waiting for El camino.. and am hearing master chef voice at the end of the trailer, very much looking forward The best series I've ever watched. The characters develop over the episodes and seasons and the plot gets deeper and more exciting. The character of Walter uncovers over the time both to himself and the audience. I cannot really find a weakness in the this show. Must watch ... Unforgettable memory watching 3rd time hope almighty washed my memory before watching it again. All new one to Netflix or anyone start from Breakfast with Bad , then break it anyhow if you don't curse me . Must watch .... If someone in academic will probably be good for confidence boost ...
Dear all viewers , watch once ... Then thanks me later Too good that I am wordless, so how about .....Yo! this show is 10 out of 10~ Bxtch! It was worth a shot and I feel grateful for what I watched was a masterpiece Today, it's exactly eight months since I finished watching Breaking Bad. At first, I actually thought of watching just the 1st season and continuing it in the summer but I ended up binging it in just 4 weeks when exams were going on. Such was it's fever. Firstly, BREAKING.BAD.IS.THE.BEST.SHOW.EVER. Nothing has ever been like it, and nothing will ever be. My love for BB cannot be described in words and I'm not exaggerating when I say that Breaking Bad is a part of me. Every character there is a part of my life. I'm a guy who easily gets influenced by fictional characters and Walter White aka Heisenberg, Jesse Pinkman, Saul and every character there has something you could take in your life. Breaking Bad's is one of the most iconic stories ever and there is not a better way to put it in screen than the way they did it. The script, character arc development, music, cinematography, screenplay, dialogues, art direction, and mainly the acting. Everything about this show is pure class. Some episodes are legit like adventure rides and I don't even know how people who were watching it when it aired waited a week and a year for every episode and season. I started watching it after I read someone comment, "Not watching BB is a sin." and now I'm telling you, even 'that' is an understatement. I don't think it's valued enough in our circle but I recommend everybody to watch it if you haven't yet. Don't quit because it's slow, you'll miss out.
.
Only if I could erase my memory, I would erase BB and re-watch it again without a second thought.
'Cause Breaking Bad > Anything on screen. Period. Every time I rewatch the entire Breaking Bad I find something new, it is like reading a fine book, I consider myself to be a super fan of Breaking Bad and incredible talent Vince Gilligan and the writers who helped make the show. The acting was superb and the locations were fantastic, like star trek next generation - this show is the icon, the universe Vince created is so special so kafkaesque so enigmatic that I just cannot stop watching.<br/><br/>I don't think I am nuts for enjoying a piece of art this way, do you stop listening to your favorite song? Do you only have sex once because it's always the same thing? I see it different every time and I love it.ðŸš¬ I promise you, every review you have read for this show and everything you've heard about it from friends or family is either an understatement or only partially captures the utter perfection that is Breaking Bad. There is simply no overstating the quality of this series in virtually every aspect.<br/><br/>This show has ruined television for me. Because of this show, I can no longer stand to watch the absolute garbage that passes for a television series these days, and after you watch Breaking Bad, neither will you. You will see what a TV show can actually achieve-- memorable, multi-faceted characters that feel like people you know in real life and thus are impossible not to sympathize with, a nuanced and utterly gripping story that doesn't treat you, the viewer, like a brain-dead idiot, acting performances that leave absolutely nothing to be desired, flawless pacing episode to episode (those who say the first few seasons are slow are only saying so in retrospect after having completed the series)...I could go on. For God's sake, the subplots in this show are better written and developed than literally 99% of TV shows these days.<br/><br/>How can I prove to you that it is this good? I have not watched an episode in at least 4 years. And here I sit at 1am, thinking about how good this show was and feeling compelled to create an IMDb account and write a review. I can safely say that no other show I've ever seen has caused me to do this.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and watch. this. show. This is what perfection looks like folks, I'm not a huge tv show fan, I think a lot of tv shows go overlong due to the appeal, money, and attention, breaking bad though, delivers 100% and more. The rewatch value is insane. The show pays off through every weak point you may feel pays off. Breaking Bad does more than break bad, it breaks the barrier that most tv shows can't seem to break through. It breaks through the cliches, trends and overlong played out seasons, ending in a actual ending. Instead of leaving so much questions behind it actually finishes. It is an amazing show period and the greatest tv show ever. It is one of the best show I've ever gone through. No fictions, no hypothetical things, it is just simply a masterpiece. In terms of story building, proper linkage of short stories, it is an utter brilliance.
A must watch series that has its own best or I say one of the best story writing in drama history.
Breaking bad actually has a standard very highly comparable to Game of Thrones. These two shows are just best in drama history. I didn't watch it when it aired. I watched it in 2019 and I cannot believe what I almost missed out on! Incredible, amazing show that keeps you on the edge of your seat. I wish I could erase my memory and watch it again for the first time. Hats off to the creators, the actors, and everyone involved in this project. Best series ever. Acting and Writing on another level than anything ever made Though it's lengthy all the way from Season 1 to Season 5, it's worth every second to watch. The characters and story line would hold each other so tightly throughout the season. You would not feel any missing piece or loose ends after finishing up all seasons.<br/><br/>I am glad to have watched it finally, but also sad that it would feel like garbage to watch most of other shows since I have already seen one of the best shows. :) "Say my name" Gives me chills every time. I have watched this series and certain episodes so many times, I can not count anymore. Love it! It is too good to be a TV series it is an emotion. An incredible performance by the talented cast mixed with a captivating story creates a world that is impossible to get away from! This is easily the best show IMO some of the best characters drama and comedy. People say it starts slow but I like the first 2 seasons personally. There can be no better series than this, for 7 more births! Worth watching N number of times! 😎 Every episode is awsome and every actors are not acting they are living! There is not even a close second. Best TV acting, script. Just get thru the slow first season and you will be hooked for life Masterpiece. Great. Amazing. 10/10 would recommend. We are talking about professional and stunning performance from wonderful actors the head of them is the legend bryan cranston. Simply the most exquisite piece of television that has existed since the 1215AD Breaking Bad is no question the best TV Series of all time. No other TV series can complete with its story, acting, dialogues and emotional context presented by Vince Gilligan. The 🐐 This man Bryan Cranston is an epic actor. Such simplicity, yet so brutal a rare combination. It's a lengthy story told in multiple seasons, yet it was so gripping that I had to binge watch and finish all seasons in just one month, don't know if that is fast enough :)<br/><br/>All the actors were outstanding including Aaron Paul who was the only Actor in this show who could compete with Bryan in terms of performance, however I think everyone did very well as per the characters given to them. This show proves how a well organised and well executed team work can make such simple narrative so very interesting. Such shows are a big source of learning for every viewers & entertainment professionals in many ways.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it yet, don't miss it. Watch it now. Breaking Bad is more than a television show, some may describe it as a unique and formidable work of art; and that is being vague. One of the most, scratch that, the most incredible and intriguing pieces of work you could ever wish to see on a screen. So much so, that it is mind blowing to think that one person could ever write such a masterpiece. Therefore, Vince Gilligan deserves the utmost respect and admiration for being such a wizard of his art and mastering his craft. The acting on the show is truly awe inspiring and include many fantastic performances. From RJ Mitte playing Walter White's cerebral palsy stricken son 'Walter Jr', to Giancarlo Esposito playing a unbeknown notorious drug kingpin, who in the public eye was a generous, successful businessman, 'Gustavo Fring', the acting is so marvellous it begs to ask the question, "Is it really acting?" To conclude, I would thoroughly recommend this 'television series' but would prefer to recommend 'Gilligan's work of art' to anyone that has never witnessed the greatest show on this planet.<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>AH 17/07/19 After watching the last season of GOT I think we can make it official - Breaking Bad is the GOAT. Superior writing and character development. Fantastic drama in every episode. Only wish it could have gone on longer. I thought GoT was the best show ever that it couldn't be replaced.Well,I was so so wrong.This show is and will be my all time favorite and I truly mean that cannot be replaced.I just finished it a minute ago and I can't calm down.The actors did an amazing job and every member of the crew.Would totally give it a 11/10 . A year ago i started watching it and I stopped because i thought 'Oh the episodes were too long'. Not long ago I saw this show in my watchlist and I was ready to give it a try.I don't regret any minute watching this show and not in a second was this show boring to me.The ending was bittersweet and I just can't get this show out of my mind.It is truly mindblowing and would definitely recommend to anyone. No other show has been and hardly will ever be as good as Breaking Bad, period. I'm from India it's just beginning of web series which strike a mark recently (Mirzapur & Sacred games) have left a mark in crime related series but this here is on a a whole another level The Screenplay is Addicting which you can watch again and again even after decades it will give the same feeling as now to upcoming genearation kids this reminds me of The good bad and the ugly's screenplay which although I'm a 90s kid I still watch it and the characters are Peice of art Walter white (Heisenberg alter ego) , Gistavo friend,Mike,Saul Goodman,Jesse Pinkman , Hank Schrader and so on they left their mark truly a masterpiece Glad That I know English and I'm able to catch up with all the best anime , web series and movies in the world I have to Day that plot in this film is breathtaking. Always when i ended to watch episode, i wanted see a new one. Best series ever! My favourite episode is the one with the fly! Everything about Breaking Bad is top notch. The actors they chose absolutely know how to play their roles, and some actors made characters purposely made to be hated great (looking at you skyler). The show has a perfect mix of drama, action and comedy, and includes one of the most funny TV characters of all time (Saul Goodman). I should stop writing this review, just watch the daln series already After four months of binge watching, I finally finished watching Breaking Bad, and it is defently as good as people say it is, if not better. Nearly everything about the show, from the outstanding performances from Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul, who hands down give some of the best performances on television, to the writing, cinematography, editing, music is just incredible. You can tell with nearly every single episode that so much care and love was put into nearly every aspect of this show, and I can't praise it enough for that.<br/><br/>Just how the show develops Walter relationship with Jesse and his family in this is perfectly done. I especially love how this show presents how the consequences to Walter or Jesses' actions not only effect them, but other people as well. Without getting into spoilers, there are certain moments in the final three episodes that are essentially what the whole series has been leading up too, and they are probably the most heartbreaking things I have ever seen in general. In fact, I even cried TWICE during least three episodes, which is something that I never do since I normally don't get emotional about media in general.<br/><br/>Seriously, watch this if you havn't already. It is one of the few TV shows that I can say got better with each season, and I honestly havn't stopped thinking about it since I finished the final episode yesterday. It is an amazing experience from beginning to end. The greatest tv series i have ever seen after Cosmos. It's perfect in every sense. The story was awesome. Waiting for the next Breaking Bad project. The best series. It is the script and the direction that makes it special Everything about this series is so perfect. Its intro, characters, themes, details, acting, plot, climax, soundtrack... Every detail has a meaning... Everybody should watch this masterpiece. Can't say anything; just i enjoyed every momoent. masterwork Hey, hey, have you heard of this show breaking bad??? It's pretty obscure and underground you might not have heard of it. I, however, am putting out the hot take that this show, breaking bad, is infact a masterpiece. Have you heard that before, I bet you haven't? I even think this little, tiny show(breaking bad) is in fact the best show ever, surprising I know? Awesome storyline and the whole cast crew! I would say don't waste your time to read the reviews just watch it!<br/><br/>Season 1 8.5/10
Season 2 8.8/10
Season 3 9.5/10
Season 4 10/10
Season 5 10/10 Watched it like 5 years after it aired. Excellent, except season 3,little bit slow and boring. Do it. Just go on Netflix and click play. Just do it. There's something special about this one. I was not super impressed from the beginning but season after season this show exceeded all my expectations. The end took a darker turn than expected for me and I loved it. The way the show started had me rooting for Walt but that all changed. You see how much these characters changed and adapted for Walt and I loved that about this show. Started with a pace, slowed a bit here and there and the last season showed the actual crux of what everyone was waiting for, a surprize, refreshing and left a mark on stone series. I was stunned many times how Walter plays the game. You are alone, all alone, you know you have chosen the wrong path, a path without a u-turn and in the span of time everyone either hates you or is your enemy. A protagonist had turned antogonist and you feel sorry and disappointed. Jesse is all messed up, somehow because of his crazy friend and once a teacher. However, the last season made me sorry, ironically, and i built a real sympathy for Walter. The way he tries to make things correct, almost for everyone and dies of what was known off. You know, sometimes, you know the hard part and the ending but still cant face it. I will no doubt give this series full 10 out of 10. This show is the best of all time what a fantastic show and actors One of the best series ever, love, lain, family and a very smart scientist All i can say I can't get this movie out of my head! This movie just too good 👍🏻 The first two seasons where show but building to a magnificent and satisfying conclusion. Every moment of the final season base you on the edge of your seat. Walters fall from mild mannered school techer to brutal drug lord is believeable and terrifying. Is the best show i ever watch... all the three times Breaking bad is an excellent TV show with an interesting plot. Selection of actors on top. I especially liked the character Waltet White. The last episode is just a masterpiece. Honestly the best show ever. The drama, the complexity, and how they put u inside the scene is extraordinary. 10/10 I have seen many series, at least 30, and none has been better than this. it's impressive how the characters change over the course of the seasons, especially Walter White, to the point where you no longer know who is good and who is not. Aaron Paul and Bryan Cranston are very good actors and I love the team they make together. This is most definitely the best tv show ever made, every season is absolutely amazing and there are no 'meh' or filler episodes (including 'Fly'), the second half of season 5 is (in my opinion) the best television I have ever watched and the episode 'Ozymandias' is the single best episode of TV ever!! Absolutely deserves a 10/10. The best show ever, amazing, captivating and extremely thrilling with unbelievable twist and turns while also realistic. Epic! Watched two times and enjoyed a lot. Tv show is keeping you watching till the last episode! Greatest series ever made
Amazing experience
Amazing performances by team I was late getting into this. I fly a lot around the world so had plenty of plane time to watch this. I knocked out the complete series in less than two weeks. It's unreal. literally unreal. The story itself was just genius when you think of how W.W came up with all the thoughts and ideas to deal in the industry. Kind of cringe writing reviews but this deserves the 10 stars It's the goat. The show is perfect! Great acting, character development, and story arcs! Must see Perfection, top photography and emotions from end to end. I remember the first time I watched it, the S2E2 kept me sweating on my couch for 20 minutes. In one word, best series i've ever seen. Must watch!!! Undoubtedly the best TV series ever. There haven't ever been anything better on TV. And those who mention GoT or Lost even in the same sentence, don't be ridiculous. Breaking Bad is so out of their league. Let me do my part
the series was great, lived every second of it No doubt totally worth watching. The first season is slow..but later u will enjoy the slowness. Breaking Bad is easily one of the greatest tv shows ever. The directing, the cast and the story are all perfect. Every episode is filled with full drama and action you never know what's gonna happen next. You get really attached to the show as it goes on and personally finished the show within weeks three times. And I have made a pact with myself to rewatch this show every three years from now on. #GOAT The best. Things are good and sad at the same time watching it. Thanks to writer of the shows
What an amazing show. Bryan and Aaron Paul nailed it.. Start to end not a single second bored. Must Watch!! This show is literally perfection.
The characters, the story, the cinematography, it keeps the viewer hooked from the first moment. This series is so freaking good, it has humor, drama, action, romantic. this series is a must watch From start to finish a masterpiece. Somehow gets better each season when you think the last couldn't have been any better This series was very good and the action Unexpected and the suspense in this was impressive i love it Walthskdbd

Nice ending
I love walter white Never saw tragedy goes in such way, I never thought that I will support WW. Walter white is a legend and i am so glad I see this show One of the best tv show I have seen walter white is a legend You don't need a big budget, more protagonists than you can count on your fingers and mind boggling visual effects to tell a good story, and no other show I've watched better embodies this truth than Breaking Bad. It relies solely on its characters, its story, and the deeply grounded reality it takes place in.
Nothing in this show is extravagant, or over-the-top, and it never relies on visual razzmatazz to attract audiences. Having said that, I have to give credit where credit is due, because this show has some of the best cinematography I've ever witnessed. Michael Slovis, Vince Gilligan, and all the directors attached to the show have labored to give us some truly jaw dropping shots, from the vast endless New Mexican deserts to time lapse shots of Albuquerque to POV shots of a fly.
Then there's the acting, which is simply phenomenonal. A couple of episodes in, you'll completely forget that these are actors pretending to be fictional characters. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul in particular deliver some groundbreaking performances.
The story is also amazing. The writers always find new and unexpected ways to both subvert our expectations and reward them. Some of the best episodes in the series are "One Minute," "Ozymandias," and, "Crazy Handful of Nothin'". Not to say the others are bad; far from it. The lowest rated BB episode "Fly" is considered by those who support it as a work of art. If that doesn't convince you, I don't know what will.
Ultimately, the reason this show is so popular is because it always strived to outdo itself, without ever trying to jump the shark. It kept on getting better and better, and before the possibility of becoming mediocre had even reared its ugly head the showrunners ended the show, at its very peak. It never outstayed its welcome, it never disappointed, and it never made a narrative misstep.
BB is the GOAT. Magnificent Best actor in all tv serious best ending ever on tv serious One of the many things which keeps us interested is great dialogue delivery . Be it Walter white or Pinkman or Saul or Hank etc. Best series ever......................brayn carenston was perfect What is to say? Phenomenal storytelling. Superb acting! Edge-of-your-seat narrative!
A must watch.
Never binging has been so enjoyable. I liked the ending and the thriller in each episode. It is totally unexpected Honestly one of the best shows I've ever watched. You don't have to be into drugs to watch it. Although the premise of the show is about the manufacturing of drugs, what really makes the story compelling is the characters. Top notch acting, combined with strong character development. If you want to watch a show in which every character on screen has something imteresting or exciting about them, than this is the show for you. If you want to watch a show in which the end of every episode makes you wonder: "How on earth will they get out of this dilemma?" Than this is the show for you. Breaking bad doesn't give you cheap, quick, flashy action scenes, instead it knows exactly how to create psychological tension and how to build up the anticipation, before it gives you an amazing, action- or drama-filled pay off.
Truly one of the greats. Breaking Bad is not a TV show, it's a once in a lifetime experience. It's a clever and gripping story, told from start to finish without a single mistake. The acting, the dialogues, the cinematography, the direction, the music, everything is constantly brilliant and never stops to amaze the viewer. Trust me, if you haven't already seen it, do it as soon as possible. Just watch the first couple episodes and you will be addicted. The sudden change of a common man. Walter White, placid high school teacher, was taken ill with an incurable disease. Turns out not to have anything to lose by becoming a drug dealer to ensure a bright future for his family.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad is without a doubt the most realistic, vivid, perfectly executed, psychedelic, brilliant, Mind Blowing, Stunning Comedy-Drama Series ever!!! It beats even Twin Peaks and I am a huge D.Lynch fan imagine that! Bryan Cranston is a hell of an actor, he deserves to be crowned in the Hollywood firmament and Vince Gilligan is a visionary genius. Masterpiece. I watched four seasons of this show and then lost interest completely.<br/><br/>It's not a terrible show but it is a wildly overrated show.<br/><br/>Before I started watching it people said the first season was just OK but it got much better after that. I think the opposite is true.<br/><br/>The first season was all about the meth side of things. That made it interesting. It quickly developed into a kind of dark, dramatic farce that I found most enjoyable.<br/><br/>Also, the characters were great. I really enjoyed the development of Walter and Jessie's relationship. It was strained but funny because of it.<br/><br/>From my point of view the show jumped the shark between the end of the first season and the start of the second. Only a small shark; maybe a barracuda; and it spent the rest of its run straining against the urge to execute a further, much bigger leap, like a superman punch over a great white.<br/><br/>1. It quickly regressed to the mean and became a soap opera. Soap operas are popular. That must be why it got MORE popular. The humour took a back seat and the melodrama grabbed the wheel.<br/><br/>2. The characters became unknowable. They felt and acted in whatever way was necessary to progress the story regardless of who they had been before. They made more and more out of character choices until they lost all definition. It began to appear that everyone in the show had some sort of borderline personality disorder.<br/><br/>3. It became increasingly reliant on hang time. This is when a very predictable chain of events is set in motion but takes an excruciatingly long time to resolve, by which time any resolution feels unsatisfactory. It's like you feel like you need to sneeze for weeks and then the feeling just fades away.<br/><br/>4. The lack of coherent character development seemed to lead to an inability to progress the story. The characters seem to start down one path; then backtrack; then try another; and they just never go anywhere. They keep having the same arguments and making the same mistakes and doing random inexplicable things.<br/><br/>5. Jessie. In the beginning it looks like Jessie is a smart kid that has gone off the rails. Bit of cliché but it still had merit as an opportunity to see what kind of person he might grow into as a result of the journey he and Walter had embarked on. What actually happens is that he turns into an idiot. People are affected by their relationships and their actions; that's how people develop/grow/change. Jessie did not grow. He devolved into a half wit. He had to because the Jessie from the first series, while not a Mensa member, was not stupid enough to end up where he did later on.<br/><br/>6. Coincidence driven. This is one of the main reasons why I can't understand all the talk of great writing on this show. Using coincidence to progress a story is a sign of very poor writing.<br/><br/>7. The end of season four felt like the end of the show to me. Walter had emerged victorious but in doing so he had become just like his mortal enemy. I thought that was quite a cool ending. Then another season happened but I just couldn't get interested.<br/><br/>Having said all that, I did watch four seasons and I did enjoy it a lot in patches. It retains some of the season one humour throughout, the acting is great, and there are a few great characters skirting around the central group of narcissistic personality disorder sufferers. Mike, Hank, and Sol are my favourites.<br/><br/>I think I'm just a little disappointed in the show. There were so many interesting directions to go in after the first season and really it didn't go anywhere. I think of I knew how to make meth and I decided to go into business today I'd expect to be a long way from where I started in five years time; a long, long way. After watching the first two seasons when they came out, i lost interest after the abysmal first half of season 3. Fast forward to 2014 and i watched the rest of it to the end. Don't get me wrong. it's a good series, but it's not IMHO worth all the "Best series EVER!"-hype. Plot holes and random events are my main gripe(Plane crash and Jesses gasoline spree are just two of them). Then there is that 3rd season, which is good in the last few episodes but the rest of the season kinda sucks(a whole episode about swatting a fly for example). Season 4 and 5 is very good indeed, lots of tension and good drama. The ending i could see miles away, albeit good but very predictable.<br/><br/>All in all: 8/10 My husband and I started watching the BB marathon three weeks ago. We just finished it today. They couldn't have picked a better cast for this show. Brian Cranston puts on a performance of a lifetime. And I couldn't picture anyone else playing the part. Every episode will leave you begging to watch the next one. The sad thing is its over and I'm still wishing there was another season. This is the first review I've ever felt compelled to write. The best thing is the series finale will leave nothing to the imagination. <br/><br/>For the foreseeable future my TV watching will be forever ruined due to the fact that I will compare every show I watch to BB.<br/><br/>RIP Breaking Bad.... and Hiesenberg <br/><br/>Hope we see Jessie and Saul VERY soon!!!<br/><br/>Good Luck to all the cast Thank You Gilligan for creating my mind the <br/><br/>"BEST SHOW EVER"<br/><br/>PS. Even Anthony Hopkins thinks it's the best acting he's EVER seen. And it only took him 2 weeks to watch 5 seasons.... Amazing. Fantastic. Wonderful. Dramatic. Intense. Terrific. Fabulous. Tremendous. I can't come up with enough adjectives to describe how great this show is. I didn't even know what it was about when I started watching it, which made it that much better. I started watching it on Netflix after the system hounded me endlessly to try it, and finished it on cable, since Netflix didn't have the last episodes.<br/><br/>What's so great about it? BB is about family. It's about craziness. It's about corruption. It's about the love of money. It's about the contradiction between our public vs private personas. It's about fear, love, hate, happiness, sadness, and indifference. It's about conflicts, children, and the monotony of suburban existence. It's about being human. Everyone can relate to something in the show. Even if somehow you can't, it hooks you from the very start. This is coming from a person who is very picky about TV. I have never seen a show as awesome as this one. I urge you to give it a try. I was had some accumulated downtime and decided to have a BB marathon after the rave reviews with the latest season. So I went through all 5 seasons within a week. Perhaps I had too high an expectation from the onset but boy did some episodes bomb out. Conversations were dragging, plots were thin, some were so drawn out that I had resorted to the 'forward' function just to get things going. Too much was revolving around the 'local' scene, perhaps they should have written more of the cartel factor. Anyway, it seems like a 'self fulling prophecy'. Everyone gives good reviews, comments about the show, so it has to be good. Perhaps there isn't anything spectacular out there so this has to be good. Not that Prison Break was my favorite but it will run circles around BB. Granted season 5 of BB was good, but 1-4... only marginally acceptable. I'm a long time reader of the reviews here but this disappointment on BB urged me to write this review. I, like many people, refused to watch "Breaking Bad" for the sole reason that I also erroneously believed it was a show about drug culture. What made it worse for me was that it was about what I believe to be worst of drug scourges in methamphetamines which proliferate within our underground to destroy so many lives. Having gone through own rebellious stages as a youth and experimenting with mind altering substances, I feel fortunate to have indulged in a time when artificial chemicals were not as prevalent as they are today.<br/><br/>I already had, through these early years, experienced enough of the subculture to recognize how the descriptive term of "seedy" is an understatement. It is a world rife with opportunistic exploitation and bereft of integrity in the pursuit of profit within a market so large, the challenge for players is no longer one of simple revenue generation but of market dominance often established through violent means. Few players can be considered to have evolved any appreciable measure of EQ.<br/><br/>I already had experienced enough of drug culture both in real life and in the sensationalized forms of fictional entertainment to believe I was no longer interested in being exposed to yet another example of either superficial glamorization or agenda bashing pedantry. I erroneously believed the premise of a high school teacher turning to the world of drugs due to economic conditions had already been done with "Weeds". (As much as I enjoyed some aspects of that show, it seemed to struggle between comedy and drama in a way which made it difficult for me to maintain faith as a viewer. I didn't want to find myself experiencing the same initial interest dwindling into an experience where I stopped caring about what was happening. Now that that show has completed its run, I may return to it in binge form - which might help me overcome the challenges it faced by being delivered on a weekly basis. I think some shows fail precisely because pacing is a challenge to maintain in storytelling when one must wait weeks or months to keep fresh the bond which exists between character and audience.) "Breaking Bad" didn't abate in either its popularity or in the zeal demonstrated by fans I encountered. Over the years of its run, it seemed as if fans were increasingly devoted toward gluing themselves to their seats as each episode was released. Eventually, I relented in the last year of its run and binged upon it with only a few months before its conclusion. I consider this perhaps one of the wisest television watching decisions I have ever made. I believe the experience of binge watching a show far transcends the experience of a weekly ceremonial because like a book, one can enjoy it from start to finish with fewer interruptions and far less lag between chapters. This freedom is what allows the mind to become absorbed by fiction in a way which transforms one's consciousness in ways unavailable to a weekly hour long ritual punctuated by distracting and often mind-numbing crass commercialism.<br/><br/>I believe the new format of releasing entire seasons at one go that some production companies have adopted is a thin entering wedge transforming television from being an "idiot box" to superficially satiate transient escapism needs and establish new heights on a bar of storytelling achievement. "Breaking Bad" is a show, which may have garnered a loyal following by being released on a weekly basis over years, but that is a testament to its exceptionally high degree of quality.<br/><br/>Watching it in binge fashion like I did was a transformative experience. As an audience member, one cannot help but to ponder the lessons learned from truly understanding how our choices shape both our reality and the person we become.<br/><br/>Walter White's initial decision to care for his family's future by turning toward drug production to mitigate the destabilizing effects of a career as a teacher shortened by the threat of death by the scourge of cancer was presented as a rational decision. This was a man who loved his family and whose sole desire to fulfill his economic responsibility as a father preparing their children with the requisites to create a successful future life for themselves, was an honourable goal. One empathized with his initial decision.<br/><br/>Throughout the course of this show's run, one perpetually finds oneself supporting his decisions even though many of the early ones resulted in consequences any conscientious human being would struggle with. The taking of a life for instance cannot be viewed as an acceptable outcome unless one's own life is threatened. For most people who encounter such a harsh reality, this is an anomalous experience. For those who traffic in the underground world of criminally generated profit, this is an unfortunately far from rare encounter. We may find this world abhorrent for this reason, but we accept the reality of its nature.<br/><br/>When we see a school teacher struggling to come to terms with this aspect of their choice, we support his actions on the basis of what has already been established as an honourable motivation. We rationalize the taking of a life as an unfortunate but necessary consequence.<br/><br/>What makes "Breaking Bad" unique however, is that we march headlong with Walter down the the slippery slope of diluted ethics to discover our empathy with the main character being transformed into revulsion. This is an experience which forces us to consider where, in the spectrum of acceptable standards of living, would we say "enough". At which point in our journey of devolving humanity do we stop and reclaim what we've allowed to erode within our spirit. No other show has ever so successfully challenged an audience on this deepest level of our own humanity.<br/><br/>"Breaking Bad" is a testament to storytelling which will survive as a beacon of quality for generations to come. It's hard for me to be super objective about this show. Over the course of 62 episodes, right from the start, for me, Vince Gilligan and his team of writers and directors crafted a piece of neo-noir-western American tragedy that almost never, if ever, lost its footing. In its story of the rise and fall of Walter White (or his fun alias Heisenberg) and how he becomes a Meth "Emperor" in Albuquerque during his run of lung cancer, we get all kinds of dramaturgy here. There's conflict, conflict, conflict going on in this show, always, from the familial (what do I tell my wife, Skylar, or not tell her, what doesn't she tell me, how far do the lies and deceit and horrors go?) to the more genre-leaning (how much criminals go in their crazy s***, which is established early on with the throw of the particular chemical and the "This... is not Meth" explosion) to the dark comedy that gives the Coens a run for their money (Better Call Saul!) - not to mention how it made Aaron Paul just as much as star as Bryan Cranston, both working actors along with Anna Gunn, Dean Norris, Betsy Brandt and Bob Odenkirk. It all... fits.<br/><br/>Often with a show it's easy to let things slip, even (or especially) on the great shows when it comes to character dynamics, repetition, things that can be hard to control over the space of such a long period of time. But everything is so carefully mapped out, season after season, for the unpredictable to keep happening and for the dramatic beats to gain tension and mystery. Just take how the writers set up, so patiently, over a season, the opening clues of objects and debris all outside of a house, and when you finally find out what all this is about - BAM right to the gut.<br/><br/>What one comes away with, outside of the tremendous performances (you might gripe that Cranston got too many Emmys, but... what didn't he deserve with every fiber of his acting bad-assery?) and the consequences that are built up for all the characters, including those we think are made of rock and steel (Mike Erhmantraut), is the world of moral terror. What is morality in this world? There isn't any. It's the Wild West, but crossed with something like, I dunno, American Beauty. What happens when you take a hardcore drug-gangster tale of suspense and warp it with dark comedy about what it means to be a man in society today, or what it means to have a family (and believe me, there are many moments that are downright haunting, harrowing to the soul that speak to this, especially as it builds and builds in its last eight episodes)? You get... this. Perfection.<br/><br/>I wish I could tell you there's problems with the show, but rarely can I find any. I'm sure if I dug deep enough some might be there, a cliché exploited for the drug-war scenarios or having a baby around for easy drama or theatrics. But so many times on this show you - or I should say I - get thrown curve balls that really have no other way of working out except how they do. When a moment like Walter White in his crawl space discovering a terrible revelation and going from agony to abhorrent laughter arrives, it's just one of those amazing moments of drama in any American medium. It might be throwing praise like gravy on a Thanksgiving platter, but I'm reminded of Nicholson's comment once on Kubrick: everyone acknowledges he's the man, and I still think that underrates him. I will not waste your time with a long a detailed review. You could spend the time better starting the inevitable Breaking Bad marathon you will undertake the second you finish episode 1. You cannot carry on in your life without watching this. I took me less than a week to watch all 5 seasons. I have never been so emotionally moved by a TV series. The actors took their roles to a whole new level. I was not familiar with them until this production. I will now relish the opportunity to see them in past and future roles. Every episode leaves you on a hair pulling cliff hanger dieing of desperation to watch the next. I cannot imagine the pain that people went through waiting week after week to watch this. I'n the end you are left with an award worthy final episode that will not only entertain you, it will move you and will leave you satisfied with no question unanswered. Your only option its to watch this masterpiece, it will complete you. This is my first review on IMDb and until now I didn't feel like writing one. That is until I saw Breaking Bad. <br/><br/>This is perhaps the best TV show in history. The things that happen in Breaking Bad are unpredictable and amazing. This show also keeps builds up very well and feels very natural and realistic. <br/><br/>I also have a strong connection to the characters in this show. I feel what they experience. This show really touches me and its sometimes very exiting to watch it. That you are on the edge of your seat and can't stop watching the show.<br/><br/>I don't know of any other TV series that matches the same quality as that of Breaking Bad. I think Breaking Bad has reached a quality level that no other TV series will match ever.<br/><br/>Thank you for reading my review. I really recommend the TV series to watch it. We are all wondering who we are. The true self. The very big "I" definition. So, as a youngster, I am obsessed with the question of finding my own self, which is the thing I constantly look for in every piece of art I ever have the fortune to look at. Songs, paintings, photographs, novels all full of characters trying to figure out who they are. Some of them failed and some of them succeeded, but very few of them, not to my recollection, ever hit me as hard in the feeling as Walter White and Jesse Pinkman did. Their journey, together and separately, totally rip the heart out of me.<br/><br/>Now you may ask: Walter and Jesse who? Dear Breaking Bad non-watchers, you MUST watch it, or else, you have missed the true best masterpiece ever created on TV. I'm not that TV bug who would search for all kinds of shows; by contrast I'm kinda picky. So before watching the show, whenever I heard Breaking Bad internet fanbase chanting "Breaking Bad Breaking Bad" I was like "Stop it now! No show can be that great!". "9.6/10 on IMDb huh? How could people be so obsessed with a fictional show? Maybe I should give it a try." Then I started off following the journey of Breaking Bad. Just so you know, the show is about Walter White, a school Chemistry teacher who was diagnosed with lung cancer and supposed to live for no longer than six months. Devastated by the fact that his family, including a housewife, a disabled son and a baby girl on the way, would not be able to live without money after his death, he found a way to partner up with his ex- student Jesse Pinkman to become meth dealers (meth or crystal meth is a kind of drug). And this is when all good (or bad, or even evil) things start to happen, then constitute 5 spectacular seasons of the whole series. During the whole series, you will follow the two main characters in their process of "breaking bad", or I would prefer, revealing who they are. You will find yourself excited inside a steamy meth lab as a true meth cook, then get nervous and anxious anytime the duo meth cooks are about to get caught. There will be times when you definitely enjoy the badass explosion scenes, the gun shooting fights, the "Yeah bitch!" moments of the show. But there will also be all those tough hours when you fill your eyes with tears. No, you will not cry out loud. There just the pain you feel very deep from the heart, and tears just unnoticedly stream down on your face. Those moments will just leave you days of emptiness and sorrows.<br/><br/>So be prepared. The drama is a hardcore type with topless strippers, drug use exposure and very violent crime scenes. There will be extremely sad moments (I'm not telling you when, to avoid spoilers. But those moments will stay a while in your heart for certain). It would be hard for you to choose to love, or to hate any character on the show, because Black/White just doesn't exist – all the main characters are morally ambiguous, leading you to a vague land of a gray mixed space of what is right and what is wrong.<br/><br/>Just watch it. And enjoy the pain There's no doubt in my mind, that Breaking Bad is one of the best TV shows ever! <br/><br/>Great storyline, well written and directed, the actors do a splendid work, great action/adventure/drama, everything is perfect, since the begin of the series until the end, and that's what makes this TV show so addictive.<br/><br/>Sad that's already ended, but I'm very pleased with the end of it, at least I had disclosure!<br/><br/>If you didn't saw it yet, is definitely a "must see".<br/><br/>I must say, I will miss this show! <br/><br/>10*Stars I first stumbled onto Breaking Bad back in 2008 when it was about to be released after hearing about the show on a commercial on a local TV-channel. The plot seemed interesting enough so i benched myself in front of the TV casually watching the first episode, and i'll admit it, after watching the first two episodes i was hooked.<br/><br/>The plot appeals to me since i greatly enjoy crime/drama, especially with suspense. However, what i never could have imagined (and probably not Vince Gilligan neither) was how big this show has gotten and what it has grown into. I followed it from start to finish and over the course of these five years the drama has increased tenfolds, amassed an enormous viewer base and it's now nominated for one of the best written TV-series ever, and i honestly agree.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad's style is subtle yet refined which leaves little hints allowing the viewer to guess what next, but guess what? Breaking Bad never ceases to surprises you despite your best efforts in trying to guess what's next. The drama is so intense all through the series you never seem to lose touch of interest and the show delivers it all with amazing suspense.<br/><br/>The overall acting is excellent and lead actor Bryan Cranston delivers an exceptional performance making the main character Walter White into an icon.<br/><br/>The only problem i see with these types of series is that the re-watch ability is low because the series build upon not knowing what's going to happen next.<br/><br/>Of course as all good things have to come to an end or as we would say in Breaking Bad's terms "all bad things have to come to an end" this show ended with one of the most epic endings in history of TV, if not perhaps even the most epic. I have a desire of wanting the series to continue but in reality i really don't want this to happen.<br/><br/>I don't know if i'm just bias because i tend to enjoy this type of suspending crime/drama series... or overrating it because i'm filled with emotions from recently having watched the finale, but this is the best show i have ever watched in the history of television, and with its perfected ending this is a series for the history books.<br/><br/>With great gratitude to Vince Gilligan, Bryan Cranston and everyone else involved for giving us this masterpiece i'll gladly give this a 10/10. Vince Gilligan's Breaking Bad is a drama about a man's decline into villainy, Mr. Chips becoming Scarface Every single episode is a unique, unpredictable and rich work of art. The suspenseful drama is morally challenging, masterfully well written and puts on screen the best performance by an actor I have ever seen. Every season is better and darker than the previous one, which only helps building the tension and hooking everyone's eyes on the screen until the very end. <br/><br/>Walter Hartwell White (Bryan Cranston) was an extremely overqualified high school chemistry teacher, he watched his friends and colleagues become millionaires and surpass him in every way imaginable, his wife Skyler (Anna Gunn) was seven months pregnant, his 15 year-old son Flynn (R.J. Mitte) has cerebral palsy and to pay his bills, he had to work a second job in a car-wash. Shortly after turning 50, he learnt he had inoperable lung cancer and less than two years left to live. To provide for his family's future, Walter calculated that he needed $737 000. After Hank, his DEA agent brother-in-law showed him how much money someone could make with a single meth operation ($700 000), he decided to partner up with Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), an ex-student of his who was also a small time drug user, dealer and manufacturer.<br/><br/>Under the nickname "Heisenberg", Walter made the purest crystal meth in the world while Pinkman was dealing it. Throughout the first four seasons and the first half of the fifth, we witnessed Walter's ascension to power. He started cooking in a RV truck with Jesse for a psychopath, then into an industrial super lab for a ridiculously well-mannered and professional businessman named Gus Fring. After killing Fring because of his threats against the White family, Heisenberg became the new head of the meth underworld.<br/><br/>While witnessing Walter White's ascension in the meth business, we also see his physical and moral decay. The nice man who started has a sympathetic but desperate family man now became a ruthless drug lord. But the loss of his humanity is so gradual and so well made I actually surprised myself rooting for him after he ordered the assassination of the nicest person in the series at the end of season three.<br/><br/>At first, Walter was doing his criminal activities for his family, but he soon became a millionaire and continued the business because he liked it and was good at it. He slowly became more and more evil, greedy and homicidal. Up to the first half of the final season (five), his business was doing great, he had $80 million dollar in cash hidden in a locker, his family was happy, his wife was helping him with the money laundering and he bought his son a new car. But when his DEA agent brother-in-law found out his secret, the end began. <br/><br/>The final season not only contains probably three of the five best episodes of all time, but also an inescapable feeling of impending doom. The castle the king had built started to crumble on his family and on himself. His empire is stolen from him, Hank and his partner are murdered before his eyes as the direct and unfortunate result of his actions. Everything he did to assure the best of his family is ruined It's heartbreaking. Because of that, Skyler and his son turn against him, they even set the police after him, leaving Walt no choice but to hide alone in the cold weather of New Hampshire for a couple of months. Riddled with cancer, and on the edge of his time, he changed his mind and decides not to die as a hermit in a cabin in the woods, but to go out with a bang. In a jaw-dropping finale, Walter gives an opportunity to his wife to clear her name, he reveals the location of Hank's body, and kills the neo-Nazis who took his life in cold-blood. He then rescues a completely broken Jesse from these psychopaths, and, shot, passes away in the lab with a smile on his face. His redemption is complete, he regained some of his humanity. He can rest in peace.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad was consistently great, while Ozymandias and Felina, stand on the line of artistic perfection, no episode is, shall I say, bad. Every single one of them has outstanding cinematography, amazing storytelling and actors who can bring anyone to tears. One of my favorite scene is when Hank, Walt and his son watch the video of the recently dead Gale's karaoke song. Hank and Flynn are laughing out loud but Walt was the one responsible for his death. He didn't say a word, we just saw his heart breaking through his eyes. This is Oscar level acting for more than 50 hours of episodes! <br/><br/>All in all, we are talking about a flawless and quintessential masterpiece of episodic cinema. I watch a lot of movies and series but I can't recall the last time I had to cover my mouth not to scream nor when a single scene made me become a better person. Breaking Bad can safely be proclaimed the greatest drama series of all time and I seriously doubt I will see something better for at least another decade.<br/><br/>As a tribute, I did a top 20 Breaking Bad episodes, feel free to check it out: http://www.imdb.com/list/g_OeLWANEv0/ This review doesn't contain any spoilers, because I wouldn't forgive myself if I ruined this show for anyone! <br/><br/>First of all I want to thank the cast, crew and Vince Gilligan for the best 47 hours of television of my whole life. I am flabbergasted about the fact that it really pulled me in from the beginning to the end and it will never let me go entirely. The characters are so well played and the script is so ingenious. I have no words for how great this show is. This was a perfect ending for a perfect show. This show really is about transformation, misery and happiness. It really, really got me, I am just too full of it now, but I felt like writing a review. So if you haven't watched this show and your looking for something good: this is more than a recommendation! For everyone who has watched breaking bad, I wish you all the best of luck on getting your life on track now that this show is over. Frankly, it will be very hard for me.<br/><br/>Thank you breaking bad! This show is by and far, THE most overrated show I have ever seen. The amount of promoting that is done by fans of the show is unbelievably. At first I chose not to watch, simply because I tend not to sway with popular opinions. Then I decided to give the show a chance given its acclaim...<br/><br/>I was severely disappointed after watching the first season and a little concerned as to why I didn't like (albeit feeling guilty). I then proceeded to watch season 2; I was again disappointed in waiting for the big AH-HAH! moment of greatness. By season 3 I was in physical pain and enraged at everything about this show. I hated the characters, the story line and total lack of orgasmic satisfaction that had been promised by fans. <br/><br/>Like a stubborn mule, I watched the entire series beginning to end; pilot to finale. While I'll choose not to discuss matters pertaining to writing or plot quality, I would like to touch on a few notions categorically:<br/><br/>1) To fans: No, no...this show is NOT as good as or even REMOTELY close to The Sopranos -- please stop dramatically making such drug-induced proclamations. <br/><br/>2) Every character is so damn hatable, it is actually amazing. I hated all-of-them. (yes including the Walter Jr.) I have never felt physical anger towards characters on any show before BB.<br/><br/>3) Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul have amazing chemistry together and I sincerely hope they work together sometime in the future. Despite my hate for their characters, the acting by these two was quite gripping. Beyond a doubt, Cranston especially has proved his abilities to act beyond comedy. He deserves recognition.<br/><br/>After having completely finished the series, I can't help but feel disappointed. I went in expecting a phenomenal show and ended up forcing my self through its entirety. However, I realized that much of this disappointment stems from the brutal constant over-hyping of the series. But I can't say I will ever re-watch the show seeing as how that would be point-less.<br/><br/>So my sincere advice to any potential subscriber to the Breaking Bad series is, stop; don't watch it. Come back in a few months when the hype has completely died and rid yourself of all expectations if only to give your self a fair chance of un-tainted judgement. <br/><br/>I do stand by my original judgement, this series does not belong amongst the likes of The Soprano's. To suggest that this show is better would be asinine. Now let's get one thing straight; this is a television program NOT for the faint at heart. If you like your viewing saccharine, with easy answers and everything wrapped up and snapped back to the beginning by the end of the episode, Breaking Bad is not for you. The premise alone should be enough to tell you that; a cancer-stricken father who is a chemistry teacher turns to illegal drug manufacture with a not-too-bright ex-student and struggles with his own mortality and morality along the way, doing his best to hide the new career choice from his pregnant wife, son with cerebal palsy, medic sister-in-law and law enforcer brother. Yes, this isn't light-weight material by any means.<br/><br/>I'm not a fan of these shows that rely on "inflated sense of tension" to pump up the viewer's adrenaline levels while covering for poor scripting; stuff like 24, Lost and Prison Break started out well-enough but quickly descended into this cheap shock tactic approach to keep the audience hooked. Once I saw through this I stopped watching them completely and have been seeking out quality American shows that are well-produced and equally well-written, and I am happy to say that Breaking Bad is one of these.<br/><br/>Bryan Cranston is perfectly cast as Walt, the man who has to make tough choices to provide for his family. He so perfectly becomes the character that it was not until later I realised he was previously cast as Hal in Malcolm In The Middle. His emotional range is staggering; with a few well-timed gestures or vocalisations he can convey several feelings at once, and when Walt is in pain it is completely believable. Walt is a man of few words, but chooses these words very carefully, so when he speaks everyone on-screen and in the audience are listening.<br/><br/>Cranston isn't just carrying passengers though; he's ably supported by Anna Gunn as his wife Skylar, who brings just the right amount of care and concern for her husband and baby as needed and RJ Mitte plays the son who has CP and gives a very accurate, non-condescending portrayal of the condition so different from the ham-handed "sympathy ploy" approach so overused by shows from the States. Dean Norris plays Walt's brother Hank, the all-American police officer who doesn't take any guff and flushes out drug dealers for a living, with his quirky kleptomaniac wife Marie (the lightest character in this show, amusingly) who is handled with panache by Betsy Brandt. Rounding out the main cast is Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman, every inch the nervy, paranoid and streetwise "cook" who becomes Walt's new partner and guide to the world of drug trafficking.<br/><br/>There's much to recommend. Tight, well-plotted scripts that make the unbelievable tangible and don't waste a line while doing so. Superb, inventive direction and settings that perfectly fit the mood of the show, an interesting mixture of steadicam, handicam, point-of-view and camcorder shots that appear to be captured by the cast themselves. Excellent choice of soundtrack; almost every episode ends with a classic song and the musical cues throughout really add to the atmosphere without becoming overpowering; witness the searing, high-pitched noises when we see through Walt's eyes as he is in pain or being given bad news for an example.<br/><br/>What is most remarkable is that the show never gives easy answers, never biases us towards the characters (we are given both sides of the debate and left to make our own choices, which respects the viewers intelligence) and always does things that you will not expect. There is not a single cliché to be found here, no way of knowing exactly how each person will react to the situations they are thrust into. These are complex, multi-faceted individuals with free will and their own motivations, who exist not as mere tools to advance the plot. The plot itself is always coherent and leaves very few loose ends. If you see an event or object framed, however subtlety, you can bet it will come back later on. Maybe not in the same episode, but as part of the story arc. And last but not least is the incredibly pitch black humour that crops up every now and then, so dark it almost feels uncomfortable to laugh.<br/><br/>If you liked the first season of Dexter but don't like the direction it has now, Breaking Bad is for you. Not since I saw Firefly (a very different kind of show) have I enjoyed a television program this much. If they can carry this program on for two or three more seasons and then end it without dragging past the logical closure point - and with Walt the way he is, this is crucial - it will be one of the greatest drama series of all time.<br/><br/>If you haven't tried it, start from the pilot episode, keep an open mind, and you just might find your new favourite show. I know I did. Breaking Bad is one of those experiences that you wish you could erase from your mind just to experience them again. The show is perfectly written, directed and acted making it the best show that has and ever will be produced on TV. It is genuinely life changing in that it effects you in ways that you wouldn't expect, the character development is such that we connect with every single story line and we root for a character that is the epitome of evil by the end of his journey. I don't know how the writers did that but I don't see it being done this well ever again. The Walter White we see at the start of the series is long gone by the end and replaced by the person who takes over. It is a genuinely masterful study of character development. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul are the glue that holds it all together supported by a cast that frankly puts all other television to shame. We knew Cranston was good but Aaron Paul was virtually unknown prior to this role and this says even more about the team involved with creating Breaking Bad that they introduced us to this immense talent. This is as good as it gets, and I'm okay with that. Breaking Bad is one of the best, most memorable and quirkiest shows to air in this day and age. Bryan Cranston plays Walter White, a stressed-out and tetchy school teacher and father of a cerebral-palsy-diagnosed son, who's struggling to keep his family's life secure. On top of that, his wife Skyler White is expecting a baby. His life gets all the more chaotic when he discovers that he has lung cancer, and he won't take sh!t from anyone anymore. Walter teams up with a former pupil of his, Jesse Pinkman, to cook crystal meth and secure his family's future. Walter breaks bad, and he never goes back.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad is the most amazing kind of television show being made; overarching stories and character subtexts that are IMPORTANT in the grand scheme of the series, characters and all. Breaking Bad is hilarious, shocking, and lovingly original take on drug-culture and the thugs living in and around it. The characters are amazing; not just Walter, but Hank Schrader and Saul Goodman are standout characters in themselves, one being a morally-complicated police officer and the other a sleazy but street-smart lawyer. And let's not even get started with Mike Ehrmantraut: the 'clean-up' man of the show who's got his eye on you... and 'Gus'.<br/><br/>Vince Gilligan has cooked the perfect substance: a show so pure and full of powerful beats that many television shows envy it for its genius arcs and subtle character motivations slowly paying off over the course of the show. I'd personally want to shake hands with him and thank him for giving the world such an entertaining and smart show littered with great characters.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad has broken so many barriers in the world of television that all the major networks hoping to emulate the success of this crystal meth gem; and they owe it to Vince Gilligan's black-comedy crime-drama magnum opus.<br/><br/>Watch this show. For television lovers you owe yourself this series, if you haven't seen it already! At first my oral English teacher recommended this TV series. The first several episodes of the first season seems boring and the plot goes slow, showing some very ordinary and simple scenes and actions, but when I continue watching I find myself unable to stop watching... I think the most successful thing of Breaking Bad is that it reveals the complex relationship among people(e.g. between the Walter couple and the Hank family) and the desire of humans. What Walter White wants is not to end his life like a loser(Maybe being a high school teacher is not a bad thing, but what about being laughed at by his students and have no money for cancer treatment? Whatever, he could be so rich if he did not quit that chemistry company.) In the end Walter White says he cooked crystal meth not for his family but for himself. He says he is good at it. I think this may be some kind of self fulfillment. He feels like a accomplished person, a real man. This is really a brilliant TV series I've ever seen. Breaking Bad: One of AMC's most successful shows, Breaking Bad is thematically a work of art. A crucial factor in its success is the fresh angle on an anti-hero who is the main character. As an audience, it is fascinating to watch the unearthing of Walter's true personality. The TV show is a modern Macbeth: we see a man overcome by power and lust for his true love; it is a modern Jekyll and Hyde. Jekyll is Walter and Hyde is Heisenberg, the one who knocks. What made this show so brilliant for me was the non-traditional approach to shaping the main character: we are so used to having characters that go from bad past to redemption to good (hero's journey plot line). And yet, this show is also a love story: the love of an idea, the thrill of feeling powerful, and feared. It is a story of adventure: a man hiding in the shadows of suburban life steps into the harsh sun light of the American Southwest Desert. Duality of man, in terms of evil and good, is brought into a distinct sublime spotlight, where "good" as society sees it is questioned. The theme of personal satisfaction is carefully strung out and analyzed as Skyler, Walter, and Jesse all confront their inner demons while battling outer ones. Breaking Bad is a television classic that cannot be paralleled. I was one of the person who thought this show was overrated while I wasn't yet completed with Breaking Bad. Trust me, patience is all you need till Season 3, Episode 4, after which slowly things will start to gain pace. The initial episodes are slow and thorough to give a clear picture and depth of the family/social situation Walt (the protagonist) goes through. The last episode is worth enough to watch the show completely. It is an awesome show which gives you mixed emotions/impression on the protagonist (Walt).<br/><br/>I say hold on and keep watching it. It is one of the epic stories you will see. I don't know where to begin but let me tell you one thing, I have avoided this series when it first came out and because of my false judgements I am regretful till this very moment. This show is the epitome of gold on TV and not to forget the elegant and far beyond marvellous works of Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul who very well deserved the awards that they have received a few years back. Let me sum up this whole review by saying NEVER JUDGE A SERIES BY EYE BECAUSE YOU WILL NEVER KNOW THE BEAUTY AND EXCELLENCE THAT LIES BEHIND. That is to say that I was unaware of something spectacular and if you haven't watched it yet YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TO DO!!!! I started watching BB in 2015, long after its finale after hearing about it and reading amazing reviews. Hooked from the pilot right till the very end, it was a breathtaking and memorable ride. The story of Walter White and his gradual turn to almost a complete madness of sorts was thrilling, emotional and scary at times. What started off as the story of a man with cancer trying to get enough money to support his family after his death by selling crystal meth(which in itself is a crazy plot), it turned out to be so much more. It is the single best TV show out there in my opinion and no episode can be called anything but excellent. With a perfect finale, this show has made a place in my heart, one that would be tough to fill. The characters are no-doubt engaging and help in making this show as brilliant as it is. Not one to miss out on. Breaking Bad is just one of those shows that is intelligently written with brilliant acting. Everything about it is top notch. Bryan Cranston who is well known to TV audiences for his role in Malcolm in the Middle is cast against type as anti-hero Walter White. Aaron Paul nails it perfectly as small time criminal Jesse Pinkman.<br/><br/>Walter White (Bryan Cranston) is an overqualified high school chemistry teacher who is struggling to make ends meet with his loving wife Skyler (Anna Gunn) and his son Walter Jr. (RJ Mitte) who has to live with cerebral palsy. When Walter is diagnosed with Stage 3A inoperable lung cancer, Walter must find a way to ensure his family is financially secure after he passes away. Walt embarks on a career of drugs and crime by forming an uneasy alliance with Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), one of Walter's former students turned small time criminal. Together with Walt's brilliant scientific knowledge and Jesse's street smarts they both start manufacturing and selling a unique "blue sky" methamphetamine which proves to be a success in the drug market. Walt must also keep this hidden not only from his family but his brother in law DEA Agent Hank Schrader (Dean Norris) and his wife Marie (Betsy Brandt) who is also Skyler's sister. Under the pseudonym "Heisenberg" Walter transforms from a moral, mild mannered citizen to a ruthless, intimidating criminal.<br/><br/>Bryan Cranston was a true deserved recipient of every accolade and award for his role as Walter White. He was fantastic and without a doubt this will be a very memorable moment for the rest of his career.<br/><br/>Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman was a breakout role for him. Previously known for bit parts in an assortment of movies, Breaking Bad certainly put Aaron Paul on the map. Here he shines alongside Bryan Cranston.<br/><br/>Creator Vince Gilligan who cut his teeth on The X Files has produced a brilliantly intelligent TV series that has never had one dull moment. There's plenty of dark humour, shock moments, mature themes that explore the ugly side of the drug lifestyle, and non-stop moments that will make you smile. The show still retains a lot of realism and believability and nothing is over exaggerated nor over the top in order to entertain and attract viewers. The cinematography was also brilliant and captures not only Walter White and Jesse Pinkman's interactions, but also the supporting characters that hold up the show. Breaking Bad was also well known for being (in)famous for putting Albuquerque, New Mexico well and truly on the map. Albuquerque is also well known for attracting a large number of loyal fans of Breaking Bad with fans spotting Walter's house and Jesse's house as well as certain spots where Breaking Bad was filmed.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad is definitely one of the finest shows of all time and well and truly deserved every single acclaim. Even though the show ran from 2008-2013, there are still many fans of the show that still sing its praises. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul will also be remembered for their best roles of their respective careers.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad is still a pleasure to revisit, and those that have not seen the series yet are missing out on top notch television at its finest.<br/><br/>A well deserved 10/10. Breaking Bad is nothing short of enthralling. The writing, cinematography, acting, and plotting are all mind-blowing. The show is head and shoulders above the vast majority of what plays on TV these days. It's unbelievable. <br/><br/>With that being said, this show is very dark, disturbing, and depressing, enough so to evoke intense anxiety and sadness in the viewer. This show is beyond suspenseful; it is riveting. At the same time, it is more heartbreaking than your average drama. There is a lot of tragedy in the show, yet enough humor to provide some occasional, much-needed comic relief. <br/><br/>I have to admit, there were times when I did not care for this show. In spite of some shocking, gratuitous violence, I really enjoyed the first three seasons; however, the fourth season delves deeper into themes of addiction, guilt, and PTSD, and the result is unpleasant to say the least. The fifth season takes it even further, depicting physical and psychological torture that is painful to sit through. <br/><br/>Even at its most disturbing, I must say it's actually hard to quit watching Breaking Bad because of how good it is. Breaking Bad is easily one of the greatest TV shows of all time, but I can only recommend it to viewers who have a high tolerance for graphic violence, abuse, and very dark subject matter. So disappointed with Breaking Bad, after so many people telling me it was brilliant, the ending being amazing. Well I couldn't disagree more, bored all the way through, apart from the odd 30 seconds at the end of a couple of episodes, then the next episode would start, and back to being boring.<br/><br/>I really wanted to like it, I just couldn't, nothing grabbed my attention, nothing about the show made me continue watching apart from the hope it would get better (based on friends & family telling me it would).<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it yet, I hope you enjoy it more than myself. It is fascinating to read all these reviews of Breaking Bad from people who wondered if it would manage to maintain the same level of quality throughout the 2nd and 3rd season.<br/><br/>Having talked with many other Breaking Bad fanatics about the subject, I have yet to find a "binge watcher" who saw the last episode of Season 3 (Full Measure) and did not immediately purchase and watch Season 4, Episode 1 (Box Cutter) no matter how much money they had, and no matter what time they had to be at work the next day.<br/><br/>The ending of the show (after five seasons) is absolutely perfect (with background music by Badfinger "Baby Blue).<br/><br/>The best episode of the show in my opinion is Season 3, Episode 7 (One Minute).<br/><br/>I don't think I have ever seen anything that hit me so hard, with the hard, jerking camera pan into the distance and the insistent car alarm during the ultra violent climax. Absolutely brilliant!<br/><br/>Not to detract from "Full Measure" which undoubtedly caused many people to have a very bad day at work the next day.<br/><br/>BTW, Jonathan Banks (Mike), given his brilliant acting in this series, is perhaps the most underrated actor in either TV or film at the moment.<br/><br/>And that is a real Philadelphia accent. I was born there! what makes this show popular and loved throughout is its simplicity and the absolute premise that it sets in the very first pilot itself,i.e a dying man wants to make his family financially secure even after he is dead. The character of Walter White cannot be hated,for he is sad,introvert,bully to his brother-in-law,under-employed for his qualifications and has been an under achiever all his life. This gets the viewers feel his emotions and urgency of his cause. After this premise has been set in the pilot,thus starts the joy ride of Walter White's struggle from a chemistry teacher to the most prolific Crystal meth cook and drug agent/smuggler till the end. Its the character development of Walter White over due course that accounts for the name of the show,which means over time he gets socially good-bad-worse,i.e. he can go leaps and bounds without any restrictions and hesitations to do that suits him the best. The makers have done a good job with not complicating the plot with lots of FBI agents,cars,chases,surveillance strategies,fancy dialogue and good looking tanned actors with accomplished body. Hence this made the show unique in the popular DRUGS-MAFIA genre and all the actors were brilliant for their respective characters.Also the pace of the show is just perfect for the characters in depth analysis and dilemma portrayal,which accordingly justifies the good and evil of every character in the show. I don't know what to say about this show.... there are not enough words in the English language to describe the amazing-ness of this television series! I didn't ever watch this show when it was on the air...because I didn't wanna buy into all the hype..... i was stuck on my usual shows like "Entourage"..."boardwalk empire"..."homeland"...etc.. and not taking anything away from those shows...i LOVE those series also....but something about Breaking Bad is just... different. This show hits a nerve.... it is entertainment from minute 1 to 60....the writers of the show are nothing short of genius! I'm currently not even finished season 4 yet..but I have been watching them all back to back since season 1....and it is literally the only thing i want to watch. Addiction to the show is an understatement. I'm telling you right now...if you have gone this long without seeing this show... do yourself a favor and buy season 1.... make sure u watch AT LEAST 3 episodes in a row.. (that's the usual number that I find it takes to get into a new show)...and I guarantee you...YOUR HOOKED! Like the meth in the show....the show is the addiction!<br/><br/>WATCCHHH ITTT!!!! Hype can kill some great things, and if you're yet to see AMC's Breaking Bad, this may happen. Breaking Bad has been held as the best thing to ever be put on television, but is it. My answer is it certainly is up there, action, acting and particularly characters. First the acting, Bryan Cranston's Walter White is comparable to Daniel Day-Lewis' Christy Brown, Heath Ledger's Joker, Tom Hanks' Forrest Gump as well as other acting greats. Facial expression is enough let alone the intense delivery of his lines. Newcomer Aaron Paul is superb as Jesse Pinkman, the junkie/independent meth cook, early on you may not be convinced that Paul can act, but give him a chance as well as the show can take a few episodes as this show is the character study of Walter White and how in different ways he went from top to bottom and bottom top at the same time, Dean Norris, Anna Gunn, Bob Odenkirk, Jesse Plemons and Giancarlo Esposito are particularly brilliant supporting characters (notably Esposito's haunting Gus Fring). The writing on this show is ON. Always ties in earlier episodes and even seasons, never neglects characters (Badger and Skinny Pete). The show's directing is certainly film standard with top directors like Rian Johnson coming in for an episode or two (Season 3's "Fly" was excellently shot and one of my favourite directing talents in TV). Each season has its particular qualities, Season 1's comedy, 2's sudden drama, 3's action, 4's intensity and 5's intensity/comedy/action/drama. Season 5 was the strongest season by far as each of the 16 episodes were television art. Character development and wondering whether you love or hate Walter White are the show's biggest strengths, on top of the exquisite writing, Breaking Bad is one of the greats Easily one of the best written shows in television history to date. I was engrossed in it from the start, through every single episode and it never lapsed in the drama or cheated its characters or the story. Stunning and gritty and wholly excellent. The devil is in the details, nothing wasted, everything meaningful down to the camera angles and foreshadowing.<br/><br/>This show was so tight from music to the costumes... and the acting, OH THE ACTING!!! I wasn't sure they could bring it to the end without dropping the ball, but they did it, keeping everyone guessing and never disappointing. I can't find fault with it. Incredibly epic series; the writers are to be congratulated and celebrated for this masterpiece.<br/><br/>Just watch the first episode, and if you like it at all, settle in for the ride and hang on. That is all. They've set the bar for drama unbelievably high with this one. Amazing. It's great. It's what people have always wanted from crime drama; it's about pride, desperation, decision, obsession, escalation, and the toll on relationship--including relationship with one's self--that ensues.<br/><br/>The writing is great. On rare, rare occasions there might be a shadow of a false note; either an "off" usage, or a foray into character exploration that seems a little ill-considered. But even these add genuine color to the product. Think of them as a blue tinge to a very pure artistic product.<br/><br/>The production values are great, and all personnel deliver, from top to bottom. As I write they're rolling out the final half of season 5; just saw episode 10, and it utterly rips your heart out.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad will go down as classic television; amongst the best ever. I started watching the show with my wife, we almost finished season 1 in couple of days. I can't wait to go get the rest of all the other seasons. Bryan Cranston's (the main character) acting is Oscar material. I wonder why I haven't known about his previous works! I guess I am going to research him and get some of his old stuff. Aaron Paul (Jesse) was the perfect pick for this role, my wife and I fell in love with his character more and more after each episode. RJ Mitte (Walter Jr.) in my opinion is a super star. The kind of kid that you'd love to adopt. He's full full of love and compassion to his family. I do watch a lot of TV!!! And frankly this is the only one that I have enjoyed as much as the Sopranos! Buy it or rent it, I highly recommend it. I will always love film but every once in a while a TV show will come along and blow any one time 2 hour experience out of the water. I had it with The Sopranos, then The Wire, and now with Breaking Bad. This is TV with quality as high as some of the best films made. The format allows time to really develop characters and get you involved with the complicated plot threads. No show would be any good without quality acting (this is a major issue I had with programmes like Lost), and the acting here is excellent. The casting director for this series deserves awards. All the emotions that the actors portray within their roles are completely believable, and engrossing. The writing is concise and intelligent; not afraid to be slow with its pace but always driving forwards, whilst still providing moments of exhilaration. The direction is smooth, concentrating on excellent cinematography to really get the look of a good quality film - and consistent throughout. What makes this series stand out most for me is that each season is different. It is not about recreating what has already been seen previous but concentrates more on changing situations and character relationships quite dramatically - and this is how it improves, with the fourth season being amongst the best Television seasons I have ever witnessed. I long for more series of this calibre. BREAKING BAD 10/10. The only TV series 'Breaking Bad' can be compared with, in my opinion, is The Sopranos.<br/><br/>I know they have completely different story lines, but still, they're both great Dramas. Even though Breaking Bad has more action and some thrill, they are in many ways alike.<br/><br/>I'm not here to compare them but to talk about what makes Breaking Bad such a excellent show. To begin with, it is produced by AMC, a channel which never disappoints in the matter of quality of TV series they air. The actors and performances are very good and intense (and that's at least a plus two in a TV drama), the writing is very solid and coherent, and the direction of each episode is masterfully done.<br/><br/>Bryan Cranston was one of my favorite comedy TV actors of all time since Malcolm in the Middle (FOX), and it's very nice to see how he evolved in a very positive way to drama television.<br/><br/>These are the seasons I give it a reasonable 10/10. And I'm sure you would give it too, if you just give this excellent show a chance to prove it's worth it. For over a year, I had a chance to watch this show on Comcast ON DEMAND. I watched the first episode of season two a couple of times, but never got past the first five or so minutes.<br/><br/>Out of boredom, I finally got past the first few minutes and to be honest, I was blown away! The acting is first rate and the plot has more twists and turns that a roller coaster at Six Flags.<br/><br/>I bought all of season on on Itunes to complete my knowledge of the show and then season 3 started.<br/><br/>Last night I just watched the next to last season 3 episode. After a few shows that seemed the season was just dragging to a close, the final 10 seconds had me jumping to my feet screaming "Oh my God!".<br/><br/>Now I can't wait for the season finale to come, and yet I will hate for the season to finish and wait another 8 or so months for season 4 to start.<br/><br/>All in all, one of the best dramas I have ever seen. I know this show can't last forever, but it ranks right up there with the best of these cable TV series that last 10 to 13 episodes. Funny, serious, outrageous, sometimes stupid....but hey, its a fantasy right. I watched the first three seasons of Breaking Bad.<br/><br/>I liked the series, although it is much more flawed than I expected.<br/><br/>What I liked:<br/><br/><ul><li>excellent cast and chemistry between the lead actors - refreshing take on drug crime genre - some very funny moments</li></ul><br/><br/>What I disliked: - too many lengthy parts - often we're caught in really boring everyday drudgery that the producers apparently didn't have the heart to cut out - too many incongruent parts over time - the character development is weak and made me want to switch off after a while. I kept watching purely for the quality of the actors (who make up for it somewhat) - way too many clichés - too much repetition - some characters become irritating after a while, because they lack real growth (e.g. Skyler) The is a perfect show from beginning to end. Dedicating years of my life to GOT, just to watch it fall apart, makes me appreciate the complete masterpiece that this is. All Hail The King. Can't fault the greatest TV show of all times! Such a tragic and action packed TV drama. Get on it! This show is missing a soul: a beating heart below the surface. <br/><br/>At first glance BB seemed pretty cool to me, but after a while everything started feeling out of place; the funny moments are just uncomfortable. The storyline, which could've been exciting, completely loses all tension within the first episode; quite an achievement! The family scenes with great comic potential never work out because everyone is behaving like psychopaths. I mean, none of the characters in Seinfeld are particularly pleasant and yet they make for good viewing, because they actually respond to their environment in a manner that we can relate to. The violence felt all wrong too. I like my gore (Braindead) as much as the next guy, but it needs to intensify the experience of the story; in BB it's just giving people something to gross out on to prevent them from realizing that nothing important is really happening (Game of Thrones anyone?).<br/><br/>The fact that so many people lose their mind over this show worries me a bit. Then again, I suppose every generation gets the TV show it deserves. We live in confusing times. The good news is that people want to be entertained by something as different as Breaking Bad. The bad news is that what they're excited by is so hollow. The second time I saw it, I found that there were so many details, and many links echoed with the later plot, with some irony. One white and one powder, it seems that I still like it. From any point of view, the play is worthy of God play. Cancer locks the final countdown of his life, but he lives out of it. To some extent, it's cancer that makes him reborn. After "I am away", it's an empire that neither the audience nor himself imagined. One of the best show I have seen!! Exactly shows how a man can change into exact opposite when situation arsies. The middle-aged male teacher, who is poor and down-to-earth, with his genius and courage to see the dead as the end, has made an exciting career of poison teacher under the surface of a quiet life! Full of tension plot, natural and appropriate interpretation, full score work. What really makes Breaking Bad one of the most moral TV dramas in history is that actions lead to results. Whether it's out of pain, greed, fear or panic. You are bound to take the consequences for your actions, not for your inner scheming. All time favourite show classic story 😍 Acting😘😘 It's getting better and better season after season By all the angles of the show it's the most intriguing satisfying history. Some of the best tv you'll ever see- an absolute must watch. Cranston is amazing! Hands down the best TV Show / Series I've ever watched.<br/><br/>Brilliant story, acting, dialogs, characters etc etc.<br/><br/>For those who haven't seen it yet, you are missing out on something special. Alongside lost, my favorite television series of all time. I still like watching movies and TV plays about crimes. I have been watching this one all the time and recommend it to everyone. It is worth watching. Must watch web series
You will get addicted of this what a fantastic web series it is i don't have any words to describe that how fabulous this web series is I always argue with everyone this show is the greatest of all and Better Call Saul is the 2nd greatest I just want to dedicate the thesaurus of word 'amazing' from Webster's dictionary to this show..
I watched it like four times.. I couldn't find a single flaw.. whether it's the storyline, acting specially Aaron Paul's acting, direction.. and believe me this show is more addictive than any narcotics available in the world.. Greatest TV show ever, sitting thru all the families breakfasts and boring meetings id worth the wait! GOAT I am from India, I don't have any idea how DEA works in real or what's meth and things and still I loved the show. Actually I lived it. Wonderful script, great acting. THIS IS THE BEST TV SERIES I HAVE SEEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.
P.S- dont watch any season,u will be autometically additced to whole series. Best show ever made don't fight me in this. If you love breaking bad should go better call saul after you end this show. This TV show is just awesome. It has unexpected plot twists. You won't understand how the hero gets transformed to villain. Every character has their unique part. No other show can be as amazing as it is. Not even Game of Thrones It is no exaggeration.This is, literally, the best show that's ever been made. Bar none.I have seen it 3 times through, and nothing compares to it. The only thing I can think of would be seasons 1-4 of GoT, but that all went downhill.<br/><br/>Breaking bad has amazing acting, characters, stories, villains, dialogue. You name it. I would recommend it to absolutely everyone.<br/><br/>10/10. Nothing will ever top it. This show is just the best of acting & writing that you can get. All my friends agree with me. Best series I have ever watched, recommending it for everyone. Breaking bad will go down as an all-time great. in a category of its own, iconic alongside GOT, Sopranos, The Wire. Television doesnt get much better than breaking bad. rewatched the series four times, and a fifth now before El Camino (which is excellent), and it gets better every time. a true masterpiece. This isn't just plain crime movie series. It's a portrayal of everyone's relationship, responsibilities, lies, working with corporations, being in a business, being a professional, a work life, life crisis. You name it!<br/><br/>Watching Breaking Bad, it will forever lives in you. I never have seen such an incredible movie like this. It is so good each and every scenes of the movie is so logic and enjoyable, recommend if you're willing to watch don't skip any part at all and yeah enjoy the greatest movie of all time. Breaking Bad follows the life of Walter White (Bryan Cranston), a high school chemistry teacher that has been diagnosed with cancer. After learning the news he goes through a mid life crisis and breaks bad. Walter goes off the chain and starts cooking crystal meth with a former student to make money. This series is unique and original. Cranston does a perfect job portraying Walter White who progresses through the series and puts you in a pickle whether you should feel bad for this guy or not. Aaron Paul does an amazing job playing the second leading role of Jesse Pinkman and captures your attention every time he is on the screen. If you haven't watched this TV series I would suggest you to leave everything and start watching it. Don't read reviews or see anything related to it because it will only give you spoilers. Just watch it now!!!! BB is one of my best tv shows ever if it is not the best.
Watch it and you will never regret Greatest series i've ever seen.. Story., acting, direction everything is great.. After watching it you wish you had amnesia to be able to watch it again without knowing the plot or details I was like in an oscillatory stage whether BB or got....which is the best .....and yall knw got s 8 was a massive disappointment....I wud scream aloud that BrBa is the greatest of all !!!! It is certainly the best tv show that I have witnessed until now! Each and every scene has some meaning to it and the character built up is of next level. Should have been of more seasons though. This is the best series i have ever seen and i am grateful to say this. The movie is perfect I whatched in my life.
It is wonderful, I will whatch again again again.
I am waiting new season. I am not in danger , i am the danger.No more words... One choice led to a million of things; heartbreak, scare, trauma, and death.<br/><br/>Everything around him were affected in a way. Like people who weren't even involved in the business - people who didn't realize were in the red zone.
Like Jane, Jesse's girlfriend. Walter had the opportunity to save her, it was the perfect moment when she started choking. All he had to do was better her position, but he didn't. He didn't just so he could get back Jesse to him. He found the decision hard to execute but what he thought about more was what was better for him; better never means better for anyone.
After the shocking episode, it reveals why that teddy bear was in the swimming pool in the backyard. It deals with the aftermath of Jane's death; the consequence of one big decision to not save a life. It led to a devastation and a spacecraft crashing.
The effect was a big area. But as the story progresses, the effect becomes bigger. To the point where his brother-in-law dies. And a violent fight with his family, the love of his family that turns into hate. And to an earlier death.
Looking back in the beginning, everything that happened in the story wouldn't have happened if Walter White didn't made the choice, the choice to change his life. And you would think, "Yeah, he really was the cause of everything that happened in the story." All hell broke loose when he did - and that's what it means to break bad.
Breaking Bad is a story about change. A story about how things change and could change. A transition of a man from being good to evil. And how every action has a reaction. It's a literal chemistry.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad is the kind of TV that will stick with you for a while. A TV that will be argued about by people as to why what made it so great. A TV that is perfect in many ways; it's a savage in character development, it has a sharp and thorough but not bland storytelling, it has a visually stunning cinematography, full of details and symbols, and jaw-breaking acting. It is many things.
Breaking Bad is a critic's favorite, and a favorite by many. When it comes to figuring out what to watch, if you haven't seen Breaking Bad, then it's the show for you.<br/><br/>Loved. 10/10 Best drama I have ever seen!! Not normally into dramas by the time this came around but this by far is the most addictive bit of TV I have ever seen. The characters stay true to themselves all the way through the drama and the whole thing goes full circle and ties off a lot of lose ends. NO ONE can beat this tv show.
Every character takes place in your heart especially jesse.
Every character buidup is very good.
And last three episodes are mind-blowing Breaking Bad is by far the best show of all time. The drama. The character development. The acting. The build up. The suspense. Everything about it is just perfect! There will never be another show as good as Breaking Bad. This is the true GOAT show. Nothing compares. All hail Vince Gillligan. The best tv show ever i love how the main character developed through the seasons Amazing show. None of the other TV shows have matched up to the excellence of this one. Such an unconventional plot, also giving us a profound message!
Screenplay, storyline, acting everything is nothing less than stellar.<br/><br/>I hope that people would make many more shows with such impactful storyline and some real life lessons.<br/><br/>This series gives out a strong message of being less judgemental of anyone, even if they cross the conventional protocol of the society.<br/><br/>Walter White led his entire life walking on the staight line that society had drawn for him. He was extraordinary in his line of work with unconditonal passion for Chemistry. Even then he gets treated as an underdog like most of the real life heros.
He was fearful of everything in life, till he discovers about his lung cancer which in turn makes him break bad. Love it so much best show ever skshsbdjidhebs

Jsjehd Thank you Vince Gilligan you are the best thank you Bryan and aaron One of the best if not the best , best ending OMG wow The best show ever made. Thank you everyone who gives us this epic series Recently finished Breaking Bad.<br/><br/>Fantastic TV show and really enjoyed watching three or four episodes per sitting.
It really is a case of getting to an end of an episode and saying "just one more"<br/><br/>It has so many great characters.<br/><br/>Watch it. I didn't end the show until now but i can say this is the greatest thing i've ever seen .. GoT in the second rank because season 8 .. if they stopped in season 7 he will be the greatest tv show Worlds best series ever.... It deserve 10/10 rating Yes yes I can guarantee you the breaking bad is the best tv show ever and for those who say that it isn't I am sorry for the word but your dumb!!! The most beautiful family drama ever made. Every episode, every season is pure art. This series is great and the best tv show , i think it's the number one in history of television One of the most wonderful TV Series I've ever watched. This is the best TV show I have ever seen. This is my thoughts for each season...<br/><br/>S1: Interesting build-up but I don't like the whole drugs and violence genre... not sure if this is my cup of tea. Walter White is an interesting character but will they be able to make him interesting enough to pull off so many seasons?<br/><br/>S2: Hmm it's getting interesting but also darker. Saul Goodman is a nice break from all the dark intensity. The black humour of the show is genius.<br/><br/>S3: Wow it's really getting interesting now, Jesse and Walt's chemistry (no pun intended) is brilliant. Gus is such a fascinating character.<br/><br/>S4: Brilliant! Wow, that end! And Crawl Space had the most intense ending I have ever seen. Brilliant cinematography too! I love this show. How can they possibly top this in S5?<br/><br/>S5 (first half): Hmm it's alright but not as good as S4. They're developing some new characters. I am definitely curious about where they will take this towards the end.<br/><br/>S5 (second half): WOW WOW WOW, OMG OMG OMG, WOW WOW WOW, OMG...<br/><br/>Walter White is the greatest character ever written!<br/><br/>(In hindsight, s1 was amazing too. It was like the first strokes of a painter. You appreciate their purpose more when you see the completed painting.) Thank u vince, we cant repay you for the pleasure of watching breaking bad over and over again This was Probably the best series I have seen yet. My boyfriend and I actually borrowed the whole series from a friend, and we watched it all within 10 days. It Really keeps you on the edge of your seat, and wanting more. Holy moly this is the most awsome and gtreatest show of all time. All other tv shows stink when compared to this. One of the best series to be ever made for TV.It Has a Very good Sad Story About Drugs About Poverty About Treason The Best There Is, the Best There Was, the Best There Ever Will Be - To put it short and sharp about this series. Character Walter white will be remembered for ages.. Best show ever mad till now no one can replace this show no one I finally watched BB... it is incredible. The actors, the writing/story, director... I'm speechless. Cranston is incredible, along with Paul, this duo of actors deserve every award they got, and more. Thank you Gilligan you are a genius! Incredibly well written piece of art. The science, drama, comedy, crime, adventure...all are mixed and balanced into a story that keeps you magically glued to your seat the whole time. There is no other show that is worth binge watching than breaking bad. From season 1 pilot to season 5 felina the tv characters enter your real life and intervene in your day to day tasks making you a hopeless addict of the show.<br/><br/>All the glory and honor to the creator Vince Gilligan and world class actors Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul and Dean Norris along with other cast members, writers and production staff.<br/><br/>This show will be admired and marveled in the history books as a masterpiece second only to Shakespeare's Hamlet. Not my favorite show! But it is the best one I ever watched. There is no filler episode and not a single minute beeing wasted. The whole show is a dramatic rollercoaster. The characters are realistic and you really grow onto them . You can see how Walter and Jesse mature thoughout the series. Its a must watch Never have I ever found a TV show that I have watched 5 times over and still loved every bit of it. This show is very deserving of the 9.5 overall rating, but would say it deserves even better. I don't have cable, but had stumbled upon this show on Netflix for the first time after it ultimately ended. My only disappointment was not knowing about it sooner than this. The storyline, plot and characters are some of the best I've ever had the pleasure of watching. I've never found a show that had me wanting to watch the whole series in one night.<br/><br/>Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul had great chemistry (no pun intended) on screen, even for being two completely different characters. There is no slip up in the plot that I could see and was completely thought through.<br/><br/>Every character, even the bad guys who only made a couple appearances, each had such a unique personality and purpose in the series. The main actors were so very well suited for each character and don't think this show would have been the same without them.<br/><br/>The foreshadowing is unlike anything I've ever seen and isn't too overdone. The attention to detail is phenomenal and really made the entire series one for the record and I think is what made it so great. Every little bit of it (from the characters to the details) served a purpose leaving nothing just randomly thrown in there as some tend to do. The actors themselves were enough to keep you glued, but add a unique plot, great attention to detail and surprising twists on top of that makes for one heck of an amazingly, beautiful TV show.<br/><br/>The only thing I don't understand is the negative reviews I've seen towards Anna's character Skyler. If you think of the reasons why she became so hateful towards Walt, it makes perfect sense and is a super believable reaction and change of personality for someone who finds out her husband is a meth drug Lord that constantly lies to her throughout an entirely emotional pregnancy. I think the way her character went was very fitting for the circumstances. This goes for every other character as well. Seeing them go from their original personalities that were first revealed to where the show ended makes for some of the best acting you almost think they've literally lived through it.<br/><br/>Also hearing that the character of Jesse was supposed to be killed off in the beginning makes me glad things went in a different direction. I can't imagine what the show would have been as Aaron Paul added just as much to the show as Cranston did. Vince Gilligan did an astounding job with this series and should be very proud.<br/><br/>Overall I couldn't be happier having wasted so much time watching this show over and over again and thoroughly enjoy seeing how well it's done as far as ratings and awards. If you can't tell how great it is by the fact it is still raved about today, then you're really missing out. I have seen this show three times already and am watching it again for my fourth time, and yet the more I watch, the better it gets... I understand a character that I previously didn't, I have a better grasp at the characters' feelings and motives, I understand the subtleties and nuances of every shot, I see the story flow and unravel gracefully, I hear how every character has his/her own usage of the language and voice, and much much more.<br/><br/>I wish I could find the perfect set of words where I could describe this perfect show, but until then, this is my analysis. Breaking Bad, the definition of the Golden Era of Television. This Show is the Greatest of all, Even passing shows like Game of Thrones and Sopranos as great as they are. The performances in this show are suburb. Season 1 is probably the worst season of the show as it quite slow to start with. People I know quit the show after the second episode, they had no idea what they missed. Walter White gradual transformation into a bad-ass meth kingpin is fascinating to see. If I had one complaint about the show it would be Skyler, as her bitchy attitude prevents Walt's badassry. Another complaint about this show is that its too slow, however I say the payoff will be much better. Its like if Christmas was everyday the importance of that day would diminish. Season 5 was the best season not just in Breaking Bad but all TV. My mind was in a never ending fight off I want to savour each episode and I wanna see what happens. Ended up bingging the last season in 3 days. If you haven't watched the show get out from underneath your rock and watch it. This show makes the rest of tv look terrible and is more amazing than it has any right to be. I can't explain...I will say only one thing Great tv series made... better than got ... Normally i don't write reviews, but after i finished this series finally i felt the necessity to write one down. why breaking bad is one of the best tv series ever made? because it's one of the most realistic ones which focused on human nature and how life can transform us, how a simple man can become a monster, pure evil and at the same moment the total opposite, how he was so scared, weak and helpless then become the master of his life and what exactly does he wants to do. his mentality has changed same as his character, he became brand new human after he knew he had lung cancer, this show is his struggle to secure his family future and leave them what they need so when time comes they wouldn't suffer. only that he didn't know that his actions and lies will complicate their lives and bring hell to their doors, their lives have never been the same after the choices he made and the consequences of all of them. i am left speechless and there are no words can describe this show now matter how hard i try to enjoy it. You cant ask for more. This show has everything: drama, action, interesting dialogues, memorable scenes and amazing characters. You must watch it! The tv series gets better and better. You just simply cant stop watching it. Breaking Bad is perfect in every way, bar none. Casting, acting, writing, production, editing, score... I cannot point to one little thing and say "if only they'd done this is would have been perfect." It grabs you by every handle you have in the first few frames of episode one, and never lets go, even after the final frame of the finale. It sticks with you long after...<br/><br/>I have watched the entire series in order, at least 7 times. I have one complaint: nothing else comes close. And in that way, it spoiled me. The only show I daresay was as good, but way too short-lived, was Deadwood. But nothing took us on a non-stop wild ride like Breaking Bad, even without a horse. <br/><br/>Game Of Thrones? "Eh, it was pretty good, but no Breaking Bad." <br/><br/>And that says it all. If you haven't watched this show, start at the beginning and watch it in order. It's a manic high that you will never have again, much like that blue meth Walter White was so good at making. This show addicts you in every way, and it is one hard crash to come down off. Because once it's over, you know you will never get another hit like that.<br/><br/>Until you watch it again. I feel bad for having finished Breaking bad. It feels like it will be a really long time until next time I can watch anything close to this show. Just watch it. Just watch it. Dude watch it. Stop reading this reviews and watch it. You know a series is a masterpiece when you end up watching it as a re-run merely 6 months after watching the original. <br/><br/>To this day this series, has standards set so high, that I am personally unable to find anything to watch which matches its standards. <br/><br/>I am yet to come across an actor who can play a character which is Walter White who is an embodiment of hero, anti-hero, part-comedic, part-villian. This is not a character which is purely black or white, there are numerous tones and undertones of gray in this character. And yet, Bryan Cranston has not just played such a complex character, but played it par-excellence. His mannerisms, not-over the top, certainly not under-acted either - when the moment requires just a perfect tone of darkness, while also keeping it just a tad comedic too, just barely, since after-all, Bryan is a comedian first. There is not a serious scene in the series, which is not without a sense of comedy. Kind of like life is laughing at you as you go from one situation in life to the next. It would not be unfair to say that Bryan could carry the weight of this series, by himself, based entirely on his acting alone. Having said that, it would be easy to overlook the fact that the supporting actors did a great job too, to create an environment in which our anti-hero comes out the best. <br/><br/>By the time any series reaches Season 5, there is a sense that franchise has been over-done. A series having a good 4-5 seasons continue on for several more seasons, before they are shut down by channel/studio, due to declining ratings due to viewer fatigue. A good series, eventually fades away from audience memory simply because it went on too long. Then the halt comes, and the characters are gotten rid of expediently to end the series. Not Breaking Bad. This is a series which knew how to stop & when to stop. If the idiom "quit while you're ahead", applies anywhere then this series would be it. The penultimate Season 5 is not only the highest point in the series, but as Walter White once said(sic), "There was a point my life, when if I would have died at that point, it would all have been just perfect." <br/><br/>If you haven't watched it. You should. I am going to watch it for the 3rd time for the lack of anything better on streaming or elsewhere. There is a reason why Breaking Bad was one of the best TV shows of all time, not only because it's thrilling and thoughtful, but also the meticulous and originality of this show, and there wasn't much original in this generation, Game of Thrones was based on a novel written by George R.R. Martin, House of Cards was based on a television show from England, Westworld was based on a film From the 70s , there was only few that's really "original "in this century, not to mention the rareness of it being great, now you can see how precious this show and Its creator is. This show is a legend .
Everything in Breaking Bad was so masterfully craft that you can see threw how deep and how extraordinary the screenwriting is. Each and every single frame of this show has its own symbolism and interpretation, the dialogue was powerfully written , it's convincing and breathtaking, I've never seen anything like this before, never had a thing in television or film history can gave me such an impact this strong . It took me months to finally came back to the reality, it was just absolutely perfect in every way , Vince Gilligan has a most creative and careful brain in the entire world, he can create something that you have never heard of or even think of and so unbelievably precision at the same time, the creativity is why this show was so good, because you will never know what is going to happened, even if you do, this show will still process in a most unexpected way, it won't just give you a scene that's full of mindless actions or gunfire, this is a show that will give you every single moment, and it could probably change a person's entire life.
And by the way, Breaking Bad is never boring , if you think it's boring , it means that you are not paying attention. Easily the best TV show i have ever watched! This show is a true king of shows. Bryan Cranston as Walter White and Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman are one of the most memorable team mates in TV history. To watch how they evolve from amateur rookies into fully fledged drug lords is an everlasting intense rollercoaster journey. During the entire series, there is no dull moment or timefillers. It is a constantly evolving story with so many twists, parallell storylines and fantastic casting of unforgettable characters that it is almost unreal. It cannot get better than this. I watched the entire series in 2015 and since then I have watched all of the well known series including Sopranos, Wire , GOT, Mad Men etc etc. And this really still stands out as the perfection of TV series still waiting to be topped, if ever.<br/><br/>So everything else about this masterpiece have already been said in the reviews below. And this is just to make a fresh review to still confirm what everyone is raving about. If you haven't already, start watching Breaking Bad today, it will be a defining moment in your life! This show really is perfect and I wish that it could come back for a 6th season but I know that it can't because that would spoil its perfection. You may have heard that the story of the show is boring. But if you be patient you will find out that the show tries to illustrate the life of ordinary peoples who get in the troubles.<br/><br/>Around the world, the gangsters become what they are because of a major reason which is poverty in financial, educational or family-wise manners. I don't want to explain the reasons because I think they are clear. However, the story of Walter starts with his poverty and the pressures which are on his shoulders.
 
Although in the first days of cooking Walter insists on staying clean and law-obeying, when he can get away with his crimes he gets happy. Actually,this happiness is the result of two main factors, physical and mental parameters. Walter is under huge stress because of his illness and he won't be able to provide for his family after his death. After very first cooks and when he isn't arrested, Walter feels good and he also claims it several times. From physical point of view, it's quite normal and also proven that surviving from an stressful situation, releases hormones in the brain which cause happiness and relief.
On the other hand, Walter is a smart character who can find a solution for every occasion. This ability gives him enough confidence to make bigger decisions and become the monster at the end. Also, it's one of the best part if the story where Mr. White even kills people although he is genius. Because we have experienced in other TV series that the smart character always found a harmless way to solve all the problems. But, we should know in the real world we may have to lose something to gain something else. Though, it definitely makes the story more tangible. <br/><br/>What does make Walter to keep cooking after he earned money more than what he's expected?
Criminals commit crimes because it gives them good feeling! As I have mentioned before, based on the two physical and mental reasons, they cannot stop committing crimes. It is obviously seen in Walter when he explicitly mentions he enjoys the sex in the car with his wife just because it's illegal. Step by step, he feels good about what he does, while he tries to say he does all those crimes because of his family. It's clear that he has some challenges with himself. The war between Walter and himself about the reason of becoming criminal and the other war is the battle between him and his illness. At the end he loses in both of the battles. While his illness is returned, in the last episode, Walter claims that everything he has done was for himself, not fir his family.
Even Jesse, the addicted partner of him finds out what is correct and what's is not sooner than Mr. White! In the first days it's Mr. White who laughs at Jesse and calls him "addict". But we will see that the real addict is Mr. White who cannot stop doing his illegal activities. Jesse attends to some gathering sessions to claim what he has done and it helps him to find himself.<br/><br/>The main characters, they all are like onions. In the first episode, we may think that disability of Walter Jr. is the main problem of the family. But, we get familiar with all characters and we will find out it's not even a problem.
Walter and Skyler (Walter's wife) don't want the new baby. Walter Jr. does not like his name. Marie, the sister of Skyler is a shoplifter and Hank, the husband of Marie is melted in his career. Jesse, the partner of Mr. White is another key character who has a lot of problems in his relationships with the family, friends, employers and ... . But, at the end it's Jesse who survives and feels better about himself. <br/><br/>Apart from the layer-layer story and characters which are designed very well, the music of the show is perfect.
All the tracks are selected carefully. However, there is trick in the music that you should listen to that.
As long as Walter is in his home and his cancer is diagnosed, we hear the sound of "tick-tock" which reminds us of the time which is the most precious thing for Walter. He is dying and the time is important for him to spend it with his family in the best way. I don't think I have ever watched a better more gripping show then Breaking bad. I have to admit I didn't watch this the first time round when it hit the screens. I watched about 3-4 episodes and thought this wasn't going anywhere, the whole basement thing was getting boring for me and I couldn't be bothered with it and didn't bother with it. After being pestered by friends and it being on Netflix, I thought why not give it another go. Once again, I started watching and 3-4 episodes in I was about to give up on it again thinking I was right the first time, but I kept watching, then kept watching, then kept watching and like a blue sky crystal meth addict I was hooked and couldn't get enough.<br/><br/>The character build up, the story lines, the twists, the plot, the writing, the acting, the casting bring about one of the best television shows I have ever seen. <br/><br/>If you are one of the few who haven't seen it. Do yourself a favour and watch it. The first season lays the foundation for what is without doubt one of, if not the best show to ever hit the small screen. My brother saw this show before me and he kept begging me to give it a chance. I only really started watching it last March. By the end of the first episode I was interested and by the end of the first season I was addicted. I would watch 6 or 7 successive episodes and only stop cause I had to get some rest before work. Of course the story telling was perfect and the idea itself would make you ask what if this happened to me, wouldn't I become Walter White. A wrong turn you take under pressure, that you just can't undo. Then one lie will take you to the second and one mistake will take you to a crime. All the other factors needed to deliver the story just came optimum. Production, directing....etc. And then there was the acting, God were these guys really acting. Bryan Cranston was so real, he made the audience empathize with a drug dealer/murderer and actually wish he would win. I really didn't know Aaron Paul that much before Broken Bad, So I just believed that he actually IS Jessie Pinkman. It was really hard for me to see him in other projects because I couldn't believe he's the same person. Anna Gunn, Dean Norris, RJ Mitte were wonderful. But I have to say that despite there relatively small roles, Bob Odenkirk and Giancarlo Esposito took the show to that unmatched territory. I just want to say, if you enjoy the art of impersonation like me, and you didn't get the chance to watch this show please do so cause it will sure satisfy you. I can easily say that this is the BEST made TV show ever made!! Its a great TV show.I would have rated it a 10! Period! The plot, the screenplay, the script, the storyline, the dialogues, the acts, everything about Br.Ba is just awesome. A show that blows up your mind...needs total concentration...far better than GOT Breaking bad from season 1 it started good with how was walter white from the beginning and how much he love his family and continue in maximizing the performance in the next seasons arriving to season 4 where we can say it is the best like i give it 10/10 and finishing in season 5 with an amazing greatful ending.
From my opinion i can say it is the best serie that you can watch in your whole life. To be frank, I felt the show was not more than average after the first 3 seasons. But just after watching the last 3-4 episodes of season 4, I found it interesting. And season 5 was much better and didn't disappoint me and i hope it doesn't disappoint you either. The fact that I didn't find the first 3 seasons interesting was the story was kinda running slow and there wasn't much progress in the story and it was just beating around the bush too much. But after season 4 ,I realized that the first 3 were also ,in fact good which I didn't realize at that time. This was really very much closer to reality as it showed that a man would go any far for his family. The ending was satisfying unlike other popular TV shows. This show has most of the elements covered like crime,action,somewhat-intermediate-comedy,emotions,most of which reality was important and preserved. We like game of thrones but this is godfather of tv shows .... Jesse and Walter Will Steal Your Heart.
True Masterpiece. Hahaha really if you see this series, you will not accept watching another series, because the Breaking Bad series is really very realistic and very knitted, And the story is so great, really best TV show ever . From start to finish, Vince Gilligan never failed to disappoint the viewers, including me. Every episode was absolutely fantastic, every scene done with great acting and detail. Even a few easter eggs in there to do with the periodic table, which was quite frankly interesting. Every episode left you wanting more, it left you wanting to see the next episode continuous times. Comedy was well written, details like colour of clothes (I.e- Walter had more brighter colours, but as he turned into Heisenburg, his clothes got darker.) It was interesting to see the rise of Heisenberg and the fall. Will always be my favourite show. From the moment Walter got lung cancer, from the moment he beat it, from the moment hank found out he was Heisenberg, to the moment he died. It will always be a truly fulfilling TV show. It took me several minutes just to think of a headline without being unfair .. just could not<br/><br/>Just AMAZING ! Maan, this if you don't watch it's a loss! Greatest ever! Awesome. Loved it. Enjoyed every bit of the story. 😍 First season is Amazing,It Gives the best start ever to this series,In season two and three there are many ups and downs And in this You want to quit But The season 4 Start Towards Important point Of the Series!May be you say The endinG of the story!And then Season "Five"Which is outstanding and Fabolous Just Completes the story And everyone Got What they deserved!The Character "Whalter White" portray by "Bryan Cranston" and "Jesse Pinkman" by"Aaron Paul" is OutstandinG and breathtaking!Other characters are also BeinG played well by the actors!As Agent Hank!In the end,Season Five there is a flaw which the Movie BreakinG bad:Al Camino Covers!You have to watch it season And after finishinG it You will be another person!In the end i just thanks "Vince"the creater To Give us A 10/10 Series!In season You have learned a lot of thinGs But the Love And Compassion for his family Is I think the best!!!!
Best Ever Season I watched In my life! Great ending.Storyline,Directing,Casting,set location etc. everything was perfect.there was a flaw in the ending.But it got solved after the movie El Camino.Both of them were perfect.especially the villain were outstanding.The character of 'Gus Fring' was my favourite.Thank you Vince Gilligan. No words can rightfully describe the experience. The best ever. Watch it I wish I could forget this show and watch it all over again without knowing what will happen. It just hits differently than any other show.
Everything is perfect: cinematography, the screenwriting, direction, production, the acting. And yeah believe the hype because this is the best show out there. There will never be a show as good as this one. We'll never get another Breaking Bad I'm not joking, this is one of the best TV series ever created....only bettered by Mr Robot and maybe The Madalorian.
The problem with it is (and it is a problem) the scenarios take a lot of setting up, like pushing a boulder up a hill. Sure when they reach the crescendo all hell breaks loose and it's excellent, you just have to sit through an aweful lot of sub plots...
It is amazing, totally believable and pure madness/genius.
The performances are top rate and the whole setting is a beautiful backdrop.
I watched the entire series back to back in a few days, best way to do it as there's a lot to digest.
So don't miss out on the excellent series.
Like I said, one of the best ever produced.
Oh and look out for the Pizza scene...that was a fluke and kept in for effect...you'll know what I mean! After the disappointing final season of GOTR, BB becomes the Greatest show ever made. Writers and producers were able to keep it true to the fans through out the series even in the final season.
Ultimately there is nothing beyond the fans expectations.. How you can compare Breaking Bad with Game of Thrones? Are you crazy? Game of thrones the best in fantasy world, Breaking Bad the best in crime world. Stop comparing two different TV shows! It's RIDICULOUS. Say my name :
Hisenberg<br/><br/>You got damn right<br/><br/>Say my name :
Hisenberg<br/><br/>You got damn right<br/><br/>Say my name :
Hisenberg<br/><br/>You got damn right Best serisssse in this world
Okkkkkkkkkk?
Godbye baby S01 ~8.7/10
S02 ~8.7/10
S03 ~8.7/10
S04 ~8.9/10
S05 ~9.3/10
How it should be if you could get rid of the viewers that don't understand the strategy of the show in my own opinion:<br/><br/>S01 8.7/10
S02 8.7/10
S03 9.2/10
S04 9.8/10
S05 9.9/10 I never saw anything like that. Cast was so perfect that no one can replace anyone. Breaking bad is a show about paying teachers more money and the descent of a good man to a drug kingpin. this is one of the best shows ever created and the best show i have ever seen. you would be hurting yourself not watching this. do yourself a favour and buy this show! and after that go watch better call saul! i hear that's nearly as good! it is an absolute much watch. This show is a beautifully directed piece of art.<br/><br/>Amazing story and nothing repetitive as most of the shows are.<br/><br/>People usually watch TV shows in their free time, But I made time for this show.<br/><br/>No enough words can describe this, It's really sad that Game of thrones kids are giving this show low rates so game of thrones can have the best ratings :( Blood, Meth and Tears If you just found out you had cancer, and only had a few months left to live what would you do? Would you spend every second you could with love ones? Or would you try to complete some sort of bucket list? Would you make sure that your family could survive without your support? Or would you simply give up? These might be some of the thoughts going through your head. However, for Breaking Bad main protagonist Walter white leaving his family to struggle and barely get by is not an option.<br/><br/>Walter Hartwell White is Fifty-year-old man struggling to survive. He works as an overqualified high school chemistry teacher and as a cashier at Bogdan's car wash. He barely makes enough to support his sick son Walt Jr. who suffers from cerebral paisley. He also has to take care of his pregnant wife Skylar, who is unemployed. Not only does he have to worry about his family surviving but also, he just found out he has terminal lung cancer. With only a few months left to live, Walt decides he has to make enough money, so that when he dies, his family will not have to worry financially. He decides that the only way is to start cooking crystal meth. He rekindles an old relationship with one of his old high school student Jesse Pinkman who happened to fail his chemistry class. Jesse is now small drug dealer who is also struggling to get by. With Jesse's connections and Walt's chemistry experience, they decide to partner up and cook the finest meth in the state of New Mexico. With various drug dealers, the cartel, and his stepbrother hank from the DEA after them, how will Walt and Jesse survive and accomplish their goals. Breaking Bad is one of the most critically acclaimed TV series ever made. Which is funny because many of the big TV networks such as HBO, TNT, FX, and Showtime turned down the show according to Wikipedia. Breaking Bad starts somewhat slow at first in my opinion. Well at least for the first couple episodes. But once I got a little deeper in the show my whole view on it changed. The whole concept of the show seemed silly to me, innocent old man, turned into drug lord just does not seem right to me. But the way the director Vince Gilligan progresses the show is just amazing. Also the acting the comes from the characters is just impeccable, there were many scenes in the show that just had my heart pumping wonder what was going to happen next. The show often had me thinking about what would I do if I was in that character's situation. Another reason why Breaking Bad is my all time favorite show is because of the amazing characters. The acting in this show beats any other show I have seen, and I believe they could not have picked a better cast. You have Walter who is willing to do anything for his family and he proves that. Jesse the unpredictable partner with crazy issues. Or the Comedic yet very serious DEA agent/ brother in law Hank who wont give up on finding "Heisenberg". Also the unstable wife Skylar who was appealing to many female viewers. One of the characters Saul Goodman a sketchy, shady lawyer who helps Jessie and Walt, was so well liked by fans that he got his own show Better Call Saul. Finally yet importantly Gus, the huge undercover kingpin that is willing to go the extreme to prove a point or get what he wants. The list can go on and on but these are just a few off the top of my head. I personally really enjoyed watching Breaking Bad. No other TV has had me think as much as this one. After watching one episode I would immediately say "oh I know that blah blah blah is going to die, or "it is obvious that this and that is going to happen next" and boy was I always wrong. There are so many complex twist and turns throughout the five seasons of the show and in all honesty, not one episode left me disappointed. Another reason I enjoyed Breaking Bad is because you can really tell how emotionally messed up and distorted each characters is in their own way. It really shows the limit of how much people can put up with. I would recommend this to anyone who loves good TV. I'll start off this review by saying that I quite frankly, don't watch a whole lot of T.V. I've watched some shows, namely E.R, The Office, 30 Rock, and when I can rent them on DVD I find a good HBO series a good watch. That being said, this is the best T.V series I have watched. It feels almost like a friend, and Walter White is a character that I wish he was real so I could smack him out of the path he is going down.<br/><br/>Bryan Cranston is the heart of this show, and his Emmy award was well earned. (for a snapshot, watch the family meeting on Episode 5-Gray Matter, some of the best acting I've personally had the pleasure of watching) He plays Walter White, a nerdy, withdrawn, depressed 50 year old overqualified High School chemistry teacher who's only real passion seems to show when he is talking science in the classroom. Walt just basically seems to amble on through an incredibly average middle class existence (Average except for his controlling wife and Cerebal-Palsy stricken son). He is disrespected by his students, his boss at his second job, and belittled and made fun of by his boisterous brother in law Hank. Walt is the ordinary, everyman hero. He struggles to make ends meet, and looks back at the past with a "what if" mentality. He is at first a sweet, lovable guy you just want to give a hug too, but he changes in disturbing ways as he "breaks bad" Everything changes for Walt when he is given a devastating diagnosis, stage 3A lung cancer, and at best two years to live. This seems to throw Walt into a deeper depression (a scene where he sits at his pool throwing matches in comes to mind) but what it really does, is wake him up. He proceeds to team with a former student (played by Aaron Paul) Jesse Pinkmann, who is also a complicated character, much more so then at first glance. To cook crystal meth, for the simple purpose of making sure his family is taken care of when he dies. The relationship between Jesse and "Mr.White" as he calls him is an interesting one, it is a combination of an odd couple and a father-son thing. The two actors work brilliantly off each other in the scenes the two share, and give some memorable lines.<br/><br/>Cranston plays this character masterfully, he completely becomes the character, from his beige, bland wardrobe, to the way Cranston uses every aspect of his being, his facial gestures, his eyes, his hands, and last but not least, his speech to convey his characters anguish, depression, regret, but also his huge heart and "working class hero" kind of life. Walt is in my opinion very identifiable for most of us, and very likable, but his decisions aren't, and there lies the main conflict in the show. It is a conflict in the viewer, a caring for the character after seeing what he was, and hope that he doesn't fundamentally change the good man that he was in his quest to in many ways "Break Even" with life 9.6 rating? Are you fu**ing kidding me?! This TV Show is very boring. I watched whole 1 season, even 1-2 episodes from the Season 2, as people said me, it gets better & better after some episodes, but I couldn't stand it anymore. It's not enthralling at all, even more, plot is very boring, nothing special. In short, guy (chemistry teacher) is dying from a cancer & he decides to do crazy stuff before he leaves this world & decides to make drugs (methamphetamine) with one of his former student & they sell it on a black market. And that's all! The only pros of this TV Show are some actors, which play really good, especially the main character, but it can't help this TV Show when plot is uninteresting & boring. During last episodes I was so bored, that I didn't even watch it normally. I was just listening to it & browsing the Internet at the same time. I quit at the beginning of the Season 2 & I don't even have a desire to continue it. Definitely not worth the 9.6. It's very, very overrated. I'm giving it 4 out of 10. To be honest, this show is OK, but it is nowhere near worth the hype. I watched the first three seasons in full and was not compelled to watch the next episode after the season three finale. The depth of this show is ankle deep. The characters are not quite believable, and sometimes, downright grating. <br/><br/>I contribute the success of this show to: binge watching availability on Netflix, and the easy money mentality. It's OK, but if you are looking for a drama that is actually compelling, look elsewhere. I think the only reason this show has such a high rating, is the fact that it has such a hard-core following. So if you feel that you might like it, go ahead and give it a shot. Apparently, the IMDb reviewers think it's the best television series of all time. But in my opinion, is it really better than the intricacies and depth of character in Lost? The wit of Friends? The plot of Game of Thrones? The well thought out House of Cards? It is rated higher than all of these...<br/><br/>The answer is a resounding NO. This is my first time reviewing a TV Show my previous reviews are from two Tom Hanks movies. Before, i don't watch a TV series mainly because it is too long and too many episodes. One day i saw Breaking Bad and saw its rating which is so High, This title makes me think, What makes it so highly rated and it is also in the most popular TV show even if it is ended. So i checked it online and binge watch it.<br/><br/>Let me just tell a little bit of the plot. Walter White played by Bryan Cranston is a chemistry teacher diagnosed with lung cancer. Because he doesn't have a money for the treatment he teams up with his former students Jesse played by Aaron Paul and start cooking crystal meth and sell it.<br/><br/>So here is my review, This is by far the best TV Show ever made. I never been so hooked in a TV show before then i saw this one and every episode of this show is a gem. The first season was great even if at the first episode you'll be thinking "what is it that I'm watching". I have said that when i first saw the pilot episode and then it makes sense. The show is not just about drugs, Its about human, How to make decision, How far will you go if you're in danger?, It's about family relationship. When is finish this show it just makes me feel alive. I have never felt that way in any other show or movies. This show will break your heart, Laugh in some episode and it also makes you feel angry because of the villains in thus show. This series is a MUST SEE show. If you haven't seen it, you probably will say that the best show is The Walking Dead but sorry it is a big NO. I become addicted to TV Show after watching this show, so i started watching other show but frankly i can't seem to find a TV Show as good as this not even close to its greatness.<br/><br/>In terms of performance of the characters, all of the main characters are excellent. Bryan Cranston as Walter White is one of the best performance I've ever seen in a television. Aaron Paul also did a great job in this series. Hank played by Dean Norris is a funny one and also a great actor. One of my favorite is also the character of Mike played by, Jonathan Banks. The villains where great, Gus and Tuco is my favorite. <br/><br/>The show is not just a show, it is also an Art. I haven't seen a good cinematography as good as Breaking Bad. The cinematography of this series is well crafted. Sometimes i said to myself "How did they shoot that?". This show is only 5 Seasons and i felt like it is just too short, I want more of it. But the ending is satisfying even if i felt like i don't want to end. Because of being so addicted to it, I watched it for the second time and felt like i was watching this on first time. I almost forgot the music of each episodes is really great some of the soundtracks are in my Spotify playlist. <br/><br/>I don't know if i spoil something on this review but I'm telling you guys who's reading this review. You will not regret watching this show. This is the BEST show even in the Television History. So please do watch the series if you saw this review. My rating for this a perfect 10 it really deserves a perfect score. If you like crime drama, you're gonna love this as much as i love this show. No matter what kind of shows your into, I would highly recommend this show. All of my friends finished watching this years ago and said I should watch it. I never really have time for shows but oh boy, I won't regret taking the time to watch this masterpiece. It really is one of the most brilliant, well thought out scripts in the history of television. Every character/actor does a great job as well. I totally disagree with the people saying it started out slow (some of my friends also said the same) I thought it started with a bang right away and you just knew there were gonna be twists and turns throughout the show. another thing I like was almost every character that I didn't really like at first, came around for me. For example Jesse, mike, and Saul. Skyler was prob my least favorite but she was still great at her role. However my favorite thing about the show is that 1) every episode, every season gets better. And 2) Walt just continued to blow me away (especially in the final season) by how smart he was and how he always seemed to have an answer or a plan for everything. It was like he knew it was gonna happen (of course it's a show but his character was portrayed as a very knowledgeable man). All in all, this show will go down in the books, at least for me it will. It truly had everything, even gave me a few laughs here and there. Also teaches a lesson to some extent. Tell your friends to tell there friends that they need to watch this show! "Breaking Bad" is the best television show. Ever.<br/><br/>We start out with one main character, Walter White (played by Bryan Cranston), who is struggling to make ends meet working both as a high school chemistry teacher and part time at a car wash. Then he gets diagnosed with cancer. Then he breaks bad.<br/><br/>Teaming up with an unlikely sidekick, Jesse Pinkman (played by Aaron Paul), who is the immature "yo, bitch"-spouting, high-school-screw-up small-time drug dealer, Walt and Jesse both put their skills towards the drug world to try to make good by their families.<br/><br/>This show has been masterfully put together with layer upon layer of insight into some of the most interesting characters ever realized in the history of television. We have some very dark characters, and a lot of grey characters, and it all adds up to brilliant dialogue and plot lines.<br/><br/>The creator, writers, directors and actors have paid attention to every single detail, putting thought into every nuance in every character in every scene. Because of this attention to detail there is something for everyone in this show. Every thinking brain will immediately be attracted to the intelligence so evidently on display, that even if you're not a drug dealing chemist living in Albuquerque, you will find something in the characters that connects you to them and makes you hang on for dear life.<br/><br/>Get on your couch now and start watching "Breaking Bad" from the very beginning, and don't miss a single scene I cannot give this show enough praise. I have seen a lot of TV shows including the Sopranos, Game Of Thrones, The Wire, Mad Men etc and none of them compare to Breaking Bad. Breaking Bad is a work of art. Intelligently written and amazingly well acted. Even two years after Breaking Bad ended, it is still hands down the best show I've ever seen in my life and I don't think anything will surpass in my lifetime. Every time I rewatch this phenomenal series I always discover something new and pick up on things that I missed before. Each season only gets better and better. The characters are also amazing and complex. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul are the two standouts as they give the best performances that I have ever had the pleasure of witnessing on television. The on screen chemistry between these two actors is unreal. The Walt and Jesse relationship is the heart and soul of Breaking Bad.Anna Gunn,Dean Norris, Johnathan Banks, Giancarlo Esposito, Bob Odenkirk,Betsy Brant and RJ Mitte are also incredible on this show. Vince Gilligan your a genius. Thank you for giving us this outstanding work of art that will surely stand the test of time. Another thanks to all the outstanding cast and writers and directors for the success of this show. Trust me when I say that Breaking Bad really deserves all the hype it gets. I would give it more than a 10/10 if I could because this show deserves that and so much more. Seriously, if you haven't seen it yet then WATCH IT NOW!!!!! You won't be disappointed. This programme defines binge watching. I was immediately hooked by the unique premise of this show. Mesmerised by the superb acting of the ensemble cast. The script has everything. Walter White, a normal science teacher, with a normal home life. Suddenly, his world is turned upside down at the discovery of having terminal cancer. He has poor health insurance, so how is he going to afford to foot the enormous treatment bill? What ensues is an unpredictable sequence of events. It is this unpredictability that makes this show compelling. Things really get interesting (and comedic) with the introduction of Saul Goodman and his resourceful ex-cop accomplice, Mike. I binge watched all 5 seasons within 2 weeks. Then, a year later, I did it all over again. That is the first time I've ever done that. Why? It's because this really is that good a show. I wanted to relive every moment of the superb acting. Watching that final episode was tear jerking...the end of the most compelling drama series I have ever had the fortune to watch. Thank you Vince Gilligan, you are a genius! Seriously, no joke. This is THE greatest show of all time. There is a reason why your friends are always preaching this show as the second coming of Jesus Christ. Not only do ALL characters get development but the story literally had me reacting. Normally i'm watching a show like a potato but THIS show literally had my fist in my mouth at one point, I almost fell out of my chair out of suspense.<br/><br/>Seriously watch the first 5 episodes, you will be hooked. My favorite series of all time. Better than Game Of Thrones, Dexter, The Wire,Sopranos EVERYTHING! Well for me anyway. If you love a good crime thriller this is the show for you. Hope you enjoy! This show has changed my life forever. I will never be the same after knowing that they will no longer make new episodes. I highly recommend this to any one out there who is looking for a show to bring them a new emotion. It is definitely 10/10 with fantastic acting and story-line. This show has changed my life forever.

I highly recommend this to any one out there who is looking for a show to bring them a new emotion. It is definitely 10/10 with fantastic acting and story-line. It normally takes me a while to figure out if I enjoy a TV program but in this case it took just the pilot to let me know that I was going to enjoy this. From start to finish I thoroughly enjoyed every episode and never felt let down by any means. It is the most well written show I have ever seen and leaves no stones left unturned. I have recommended this show to all my friends and will continue to do so, you have not experienced excellent writing, acting, directing and casting until you have experienced Breaking Bad.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad will always be remembered by myself and others as the greatest show there has ever been.<br/><br/>ALL HAIL THE KING I created an IMDb account just to rant and rave about Breaking Bad. Yes that's how much I enjoyed it! Have a read:<br/><br/>I finished watching Breaking Bad, the complete 4 seasons this weekend (2008-2013, a 5-year long TV Series by AMC). It is by far, hands down, the best Criminal TV Series I have seen in the last 20 years of watching film of my life. Ever since I was watching my first TV series at seven years old at home, there has never been a more fascinating blow-you-out-of-the-water Criminal TV series for me. If you are a fan of Criminal-mystery/Gangster movies and series such as The Goodfellas, The Godfather, Minority Report, American Gangster, Pulp Fiction, Traffic, Leon the Professional, Nikita (2009) and many others in the similar Criminal/Gangster/Mystery category of Film and Series, then don't stop reading: Imagine all of the best sequences that you've experienced in your years of watching criminal movies and series and put them all together in one large basket of good movie memories of suspense, action, drama. Put those all together and add them up in you mind's eye and you'll come to the realization that some of the most intense scenery you've seen on-screen have been from the best crime movies out there. Put all of that together in your mind, and it will still not add up to the sum of intense suspense and drama you will experience from watching Breaking Bad. This TV series is an experience that will blow you away.<br/><br/>Looking back at some classic directors such as Hitchcock; the old-fashioned famous thriller movie director, Spielberg; the modern-day but still one of the most famous criminal action/mystery/thriller directors in the past 15-20 years, George Lucas; for his Star Wars films the last 50 years, and Joel Surnow; La feme Nikita ('90s TV series) they all have one aspect in common. They present to the viewer a 'Get ready for it, here it comes!! - suspense intensity' that is kind of expected to be found. The director wants you to expect it to enjoy what you are watching so that you crave more excitement. Director Vince Gilligan of Breaking Bad creates suspense in a wholly different manner. What you will experience while watching his series is a strung-out, slow-paced 'Wait for it, the consequences will hit the fan a few episodes from now...' Then when you expect the drama to play out, after he creates that mindset for you, it won't happen. Dead stop. Why? Because later, instead, it will come back so hard and so intensely at the least expected moment, that it will practically knock you off of your seat. The intensity that Vince builds up for you is nothing short of genius. Figuratively describing this, as long as you're paying attention, you will not believe how dramatic and strong the suspense comes and hits you right in the face and smacks you down onto the ground. Then after it hits you down, it then proceeds to take a bulldozer and flatten you until you're about as thin as a coin, after which the coin is dropped into magma and liquidized. That's a small taste of how this series will make you feel, in a good way. Given to say if you're not focused and you're not paying attention to an episode with scenes that happened two episodes ago, you'll probably not remember what the consequence will become in the episode that you're watching at present. If that's the case then don't watch Breaking Bad because you don't deserve it anyway.<br/><br/>Don't live life without experiencing maybe the best criminal TV series in today's era, because it will probably change your life. Take a couple of weeks from your regular movies or series and watch the four seasons of Breaking Bad and you'll agree, it was worth every single minute. Did I mention? It will change your life. Breaking Bad - Walter White's decent from kind, committed and professional teacher of Chemistry to single-minded sociopath.<br/><br/>An absolutely excellent and peerless series that has captivated me from the very start of season 1.<br/><br/>The scripts are well-paced and even if you think that it could all move along a little more quickly you later understand the need to set context. This is not "bubblegum" television and needs investment by the viewer to get the very most out of the plot, and the characters excellent dialogue.<br/><br/>Recommended to all. Television at it's very, very best. Breaking Bad is by far one of the best TV shows I have ever seen or ever will see. Just reading the plot is enough to get you intrigued;an underachieving Chemistry genius turned high school teacher learns about his cancer diagnosis and so becomes a CRYSTAL METH COOK!? I had just had to watch this, and the pilot episode did not disappoint.<br/><br/>Although the pilot episode is a fantastic introduction to the show, the First Season consisting of 7 episodes is rather quite slow going at first but this is not necessarily a bad thing, as it gives a little insight into every character which is completely necessary when you take into account that the main character - Walter White (played superbly by Bryan Cranston) has a brother-in-law whom is a DEA Agent and quite frankly - his worst enemy. <br/><br/>The seasons proceeding the first one get better and better and at the end of every season you will just not think it is logically possible for this show to get any better! But it does, and by the time you start Season 5 it becomes almost part of your life this show as the character development is better than I have seen in any other show! The once quiet high school teacher Walt has become something more than just a Crystal Meth cooker, with him following in the boots of his drug dealing alter ego - "Heisenberg". You can just never know what to expect with this show.<br/><br/>The acting is also very good and I couldn't believe it when I read on IMDb that Aaron Paul (who plays Jesse - Walt's partner in crime) was lined up to be killed off after the first season. The show would just not be the same without him. <br/><br/>If you haven't seen this show already, I suggest you do. And quick.<br/><br/>All Hail The King!<br/><br/>x I cant state enough how awesome the director and script is in this show. Its like Dexter with good artists and script. Pace is slow, but you are actually never bored. The show has no clichÃ©s, weird untrustworthy characters or poor acting. A MUST watch, give it at least two episodes before making up your mind.<br/><br/>Show never goes stale, you sympathize with almost all the characters have motives you can relate to, even if they want something completely different. The plot never gets out of line or far fetched, and episodes never ends in huge obnoxious cliffhangers. A fine mixture of crime, chemistry and soap all in one.<br/><br/>Good luck watching, remember to support the producer if you like it :) Very rarely do you see a piece of television that stretch beyond the context of the nature of the shows premise to a level whereby viewers genuinely care for the characters. Even rarer than this, is to have a series that depict the dark seedy underbelly of our drug ridden society leaving the viewer compassionate for the producer of such an illicit substance and hoping in all regards to have the drug cook find ultimate wellbeing and a happy ending.<br/><br/>This show demonstrates pure and ismple why AMC has set themselves apart from every other television channel in terms of the quality of the programming they provide. The stations motto is "Where Story Matters" and it is no more evident than within Breaking Bad.<br/><br/>Walter White, is the series primary protagonist, a highly capable yet sadly under achieving Nobel potential scientist who now teaches at a high school. The story begins with Walter being diagnosed with cancer, a seemingly apparent death sentence leaving him with relatively little future potential and the problematic series of events that result as he attempts to provide support for his family well after his death. The audience gains an immediate connection for the series main character, feeling empathetic as he hears his diagnosis and reluctant yet convinced as he investigates the option of manufacturing methampethamine to build the nest egg he believes will support his family after his death.<br/><br/>This is not a series about drug, this is not a show about shard/ice/whatever you want to call it. It is simply the context for which this amazing story plays through. The story is more about the emotional development of the characters as the seemingly 'Mr Good' enters the seedy underbelly of society, and the fact that he is seemingly willing to go to any lengths to leave his family in a positive state. As the series progresses, the draw of the underworld is a constant theme for Walter as despite the developments it continues on its path of pure immersion and compassion from the viewer.<br/><br/>You will not feel compassion for every character that presents themselves, however, every character you meet has a crucial role in the development of character and story. This series is a true rarity amongst Television, the story is immaculate. You notice not only the main character, but his younger former student counterpart grow and develop as the situation develops. <br/><br/>Having been a chronic user of drugs in the past, this story relates to me as a user, and as a theatrical buff. Whether your watching it because of its mention of the world of illicit substances or you simply enjoy an impeccably written and engrossing story Breaking Bad is one of the series that you cannot miss. If you have'nt seen it, watch it, every episode; then try to disagree if you must. But this show is one of the single greatest pieces of modern television you will ever see; and watching it leaves you feeling as if you've learnt something about the human psyche. Breaking Bad, is the single greatest television show i have ever watched, do not miss the chance to enjoy this masterpiece. Breaking Bad is a work of genius - I realize that is a word thrown around somewhat haphazardly at times, but this show truly is brilliant in my view. The cinematography is beautiful and often ingenuous, the acting fantastic, the storyline and subplots enthralling and the soundtrack cleverly chosen to the point where it becomes an integral, organic part of the show. As an example, David Costabile's (Gale) singing with the record player as he attends his domestic duties is delightfully integrated - a scene I happily admit to have watched and listened to several times. <br/><br/>It has been said a lot (and duly acknowledged by awards) already how great the acting is in this show, but it won't hurt to say it again: Bryan Cranston is a joy to watch as Walter White, whose increasingly polar double life is mesmerizing to follow as it evolves throughout the series. Aaron Paul is also spectacular as Jesse Pinkman and complements Walter White in a way that approaches yin-and-yang like qualities. Dean Norris, Anna Gunn, RJ Mitte and Betsy Brandt are also truly praiseworthy; Dean Norris' part as Hank Schrader gives a particularly stunning performance in my view as he develops into a complex and vulnerable character who feels the need to hide his increasing frustration and sense of alienation from his wife and colleagues. A great actor. Giancarlo Esposito, another actor well worth mentioning, is perfect as the enigmatic Gus. <br/><br/>This is a show that works on is own terms - it is brave (lung cancer, rampant drug abuse, methamphetamine manufacture and distribution - hardly easy content to pitch at any network) and balances perfectly between the darkly sinister and the absurdly comical in my opinion. It is a show that grows with every episode. <br/><br/>Highly recommended! I don't often begin singing a show's praises until I've seen most of the series and it has been canceled. Even less often do I come on here and write a review for it. But in the past two weeks as I've begun watching Breaking Bad I have the same kind of excitement for this show as I've had in the past with other favorite shows of mine like The X-Files or Lost.<br/><br/>As I watched the first few episodes I kept switching from laughing hysterically to feeling very serious and grave to feeling empathy for some characters then hate for the same characters later. You immediately think you have each person pegged into a stereotype, and for the most part you are right on with it, but as you get to know them, you begin to love them anyway despite their flaws and the things you hate about them.<br/><br/>Of course the cinematography and all that is great too, but that is not usually what I look for in a show, at least not consciously. If you do then all the more power to you and this show does a great job with that as well. But for me a show is about story, characters, great acting, and how the show makes you feel as you watch it. This show has all of the above.<br/><br/>The title of a show can at times have some awesome significance as well, and for me "Breaking Bad" has a couple different meanings. One, Walt and Jesse are two of the most unlikely drug lords and because of this they end up really stirring things up in the crime scene. Second, breaking bad in the same sense that you would say a plane broke left or right. In other words turning bad. It happens gradually at first and then suddenly you're headed in a completely different direction. Watching the evolution of Walt's character has felt this way to me. He started slow with just cooking a little meth and selling through Jesse, but soon he's offing local distributors, getting run down by the cartel, and at the same time his family life falls apart.<br/><br/>Needless to say I am impressed with the show and I think it has been impeccably handled plot-wise to allow for the story to head in just about any direction at any given time and I look forward to seeing what else is in store. At first I was really skeptical the storyline respective. I thought that there would be a lot of comedy in it. There is humor in it but it is not that typical type of humor. Sometimes you have to laugh but at the same moment you are often shocked too. Your smile could freeze sometimes. :) After I've watched a few episodes now I'm totally convinced that this is one of the best TV shows ever! The characters appear very realistic, the camera angles are brilliant. Every episode has a surprising beginning, the endings are just art! What I like most are the pictures and the artful way to show objects and details. I've never seen this in any other TV show before. <br/><br/>This isn't only a TV show, this is art! One of my all-time favorite TV shows! I just love it! WE WILL REMEMBER YOUR NAME.<br/><br/>This show, and especially this season has transcended television programming in a way like no other, we never in a million years deserved a gift like this, but we were lucky enough to have had it handed to us on a silver platter. How did it earn such universally high critical praises and become so absolutely adored among all types of fans year after year? It doesn't have mind bending, mesmerizing special effects, it has no zombies and it certainly isn't about vampires. Breaking Bad has shown us how a simple narrative with the correct execution and proper slow burn can become something that is so impeccable that it in itself becomes real. The father to all of this is the scripting and the writing, I will say it again, the writing. The show had an amazing staff and was perfectly cast but without the brilliant writing team to back them up it would have turned into another show with big stars who went to waste; boy did it not. This show had more memorable moments and lines than any program or film ever will. Breaking Bad dropped more jaws than any dentist would ever consider healthy, not by using grotesque savagery, instead simply by compelling us with consummately masterful story telling and the five greatest years of drama I will ever remember.<br/><br/>Farewell to a titan. Breaking Bad is, without a doubt, the best TV drama ever made. There have been a few I've missed, but from everything I've ever watched, there has never been anything more complete than this series. It is simply something not to be missed.<br/><br/>The acting, writing, directing, producing, everything is the best I've ever seen. There is rarely, in all 5 seasons, a dull moment, and there has never been anything like it. I've never, ever given an '10' to a TV show before, but nothing has ever deserved it until this.<br/><br/>It's not for kids. If it had a rating, it would be at least a PG-13, if not R. If you are going to let teens watch, make sure they watch until the end of the series, because the beginning might make it seem 'cool' to be making and doing meth. It's not until the end of the last season that you see things come full circle.<br/><br/>There is no point in going over every season or episode because you need to watch them all anyway. But I will state that it is rare that one program has this much talent, and to watch the main characters slowly morph into something completely different than they were is magical.<br/><br/>All the people involved, especially Vince Gilligan, deserve every award they receive and every paycheck they earn, if not more. The show is brilliant and for the first time ever, I'm actually going to be sad a series is over. They will be missed in my house. Cannot believe there are people on this review board giving BB 9 or 8 stars!! There is nothing in all my 36 years on earth that has ever compared to this show. It will go down in history as the best thing to ever hit the small or big screen. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul are two of the greatest actors on TV. Every actor on this show is top quality. Every character is relevant to the story and each character develops as the show continues. Just when you thought it couldn't get any better, the writers/producers throw in just a touch of comedy to break up the intensity, in the form of Saul Goodman. Pure brilliance. There is absolutely nothing that can be added or taken away to improve this show, as perfection cannot be improved on. After a few great TV series in the nineties, I had almost lost interest in TV dramas (and comedies) since then, then BB came along - this show is completely on another level, it's the Holy Grail of TV. My only criticism is that's all down hill from here - nothing will better or even equal this in our lifetime, nothing. Walter White (Bryan Cranston) is a high school chemistry teacher who seems trapped in his own life. He works part-time at a car wash and worries about money. His wife is pregnant and his son has cerebral palsy. In the midst of all this he is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer.<br/><br/>Seeing as he hasn't amounted to much in life Walter wants to leave something behind. He's looking for easy cash. By chance he meets up with a former student. The student is now a drug dealer, real name Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), who goes by the street name "Captain Cook". Walter, who was once a genius chemist, produces some of the best methamphetamine Jesse have ever tried and he starts to push it.<br/><br/>Walter, who already had to deal with his cancer, now also has to deal with his new life as a criminal and a world that might be too much for him to handle. He's also struggling to avoid to catch the suspicion of his brother-in-law Hank who is a D.E.A agent.<br/><br/>Personally, I love the set-up, and the theme. Drug romanticizing and criminal shows always have some moral ambiguity and as such, with very little spoiling, Walter is forced to do bad things. It's intriguing to see a show that doesn't push these things to the edge nor does it ignore them blatantly. Walter displays a gradual and small change. Not overwhelming development from scene to scene as in other TV shows. He also reacts and show disgust for gruesome acts of violence instead of the regular indifference or even reveling in it as we're so used to see in other shows. But it still affects him. And that is another thing I like about this show. Walter has a conscience. But each of his morally ambiguous choices push him closer and closer to the edge. Which raises another point of interest in the show: Will his family tolerate the person he's becoming and will they stick around? <br/><br/>Bryan Cranston has created a very living character with his portrayal of Walter White. Not putting down everyone else's performance for that matter. Even the more apparently superficial characters such as Jesse and Hank have a lot of subtle nuances to them. It's a refreshing contrast to the otherwise exaggerated and stereotypical Hollywood characters who can be summarized in two or three words.<br/><br/>As far as inspirational sources goes the theme of a making the character a bad guy is recognizable from Dexter or The Shield. Breaking Bad however is not as fast-paced as the later (although seasons 2 does crank up the speed) and not as vivid as the former. Not saying that it's not inspirational but Breaking Bad, so far, seems to reward the patient. If this had been CSI: Miami they would probably have told this story in one episode but lacking the great photography, excellent acting and hilarious black comedy.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a show that will grow on you and with refreshing ideas and character development, look no further, Breaking Bad is here. *** The spoilers here are minor. *** Breaking Bad is an excellent action TV series. It makes you think, too. That's not all that common of a combination. It has brains and brawn. It also has a good smattering of dark humor. There's lots of excellent character development and acting to be found here. On the other hand potential viewers should be advised that every once in a while there is extreme gore put on the TV screen - body dissolved in acid - detached head of a drug snitch attached to the back of a tortoise - etc. Hey, it's a series about drug dealing. On the other hand it's also a series about relationships between people, their aspirations, tragedies and the hidden dark spots in their lives. What good or evil are the people that you know really capable of? Did Pip in Great Expectations have a clue that his benefactor was the convict he had helped as a child? Sometimes people will do quite unexpected things. I finished the very last episode ("felina") today and felt a sort of disappointment - I was hoping that this critically acclaimed "best show of all time" would get better, turn into the masterpiece that everyone seems to consider it, at some point become interesting, or, at the very least, worthy of my time... it did not.<br/><br/>At no point was I invested in anything going on. Never did the show manage to lure me in, make me care about anyone. There were no interesting characters whatsoever (Except for maybe Saul Goodman, but he was hardly the main character) - sure, it packed a bunch of great performances, the actors honestly did a truly good job, but what's the point when the script is so devoid of character, boring and hopelessly uninteresting. <br/><br/>The show might be considered a good character study - Walt's descent into this becoming a nigh-monster who will stoop to some extremely despicable things is somewhat eye-catching, but this could have worked as a movie, maybe even a one-season show, but as it is, breaking bad is simply too pointless, boring and devoid of any sort of charm to be considered a good show. It's amazing that a show this dark can be so compelling. It's amazing that a show about a man committing multiple felony drug crimes, murders, body dissolving and other heinous acts can, at the same time, be so funny and touching and sensitive. <br/><br/>I don't believe I've ever seen a television show that I've fallen in love with more quickly than Breaking Bad. If you didn't love the characters so much, it would be really difficult to gut it out through the last two seasons, but this show never loses its steam.<br/><br/>I'm currently watching the series for the third time through ... and I am finding new things in each episode that I missed on second viewing, making this a delight even though I've now lived through the entire thing.<br/><br/>I started watching Breaking Bad sometime in the second or third season, I think. After a quick binge to catch up, the hook had been set, and I remember waiting agonizing months waiting for the new season to begin ... something I have only experienced with perhaps two other shows.<br/><br/>Now that it is complete, I realize something -- I was not disappointed by a single episode or by even one creative choice the writers made. There was no letdown, even though there was no "formula" episode-to- episode, which is in itself a rarity. It was one linear story from start to finish, and oh, what a journey -- told with true knowledge of the characters and a kind of thought-provoking cinematography that drove the story instead of distracting from it.<br/><br/>The characters are so dynamic and so real, and by "real" I mean you get sick of their crap at times just like you get sick of your own friends and family. There are some really annoying moments with characters: Skyler and her insistence that everyone on the show kiss her ass and apologize to her until she thankfully gets with the program, Jesse's junkie blubbering and punched-face blubbering and all-around blubbering -- which I guess has to happen, the poor dude goes through some awful stuff, thanks mostly to Walt.<br/><br/>In short, you become so committed to the bitter end, waiting for that final shoe to drop on Walt, to see his final retribution and his ultimate destruction -- and when it comes, brother, it is soooo sweet. <br/><br/>You know that somewhat morbid saying that a situation is "like a bad car wreck because you can't look away?" Breaking Bad is a story about a wreck in which the car picks up speed for five years heading the wrong way down the expressway, clumsily at first, but then eventually approaching 200 miles per hour with some dazzling near misses along the way until it ends with the perfect synchronized marriage of justice, poetry, violence and karma -- a staggering master stroke, a long-overdue release from the grip of criminal slavery and a career neatly wrapped up with the death of a character that no one can feel sorry for, yet no one can blame. <br/><br/>I cried because I wanted more; I clapped because it all ended so beautifully -- I cried just because it was over, and it may well be a long time before I am as fascinated with a television character as I was with Walter Hartwell White.<br/><br/>This is certainly a must-watch television series. Oh yeah...thats true ...I was never an addict before watching this but this TV series made me an addict ...of a TV serial :) For the first time in life i found myself compulsively addicted to watch a season continuously. I just could not get it off my head, could not resist watching it ..found drawn , pulled or sucked by Breaking Bad into itself n I was not able help myself , totally out of my own control. I had seen entire 5 (or 6 ?) seasons of Breaking Bad ; all 62 episodes in over weekend . I started watching Friday night as a friends suggested me this series, ; but I told him "well I am not a big fan of TV series but am more of a movies guy" ; But when it started it turned out to be one big hell of a movie ...60 hours long !!just started as timepass I started with First episode to get a sleep but this literally took away all the sleep And all this time i watching it continuously obsessively without moving , without bath , just eating chips n junk food all the while . And by the time I finished it and woke up next morning ...I didn't even knew what day it was? Is it Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday? This may seem an extreme reaction to Breaking Bad but i guess it was worthy of what this is ..Truly Awesome !!! I guess i was behaving like a junkie ...lingering in my couch ...shabby , unclean ...just watching it and feeling myself a part of parallel universe where Breaking Bad isn't a TV series and I am not a viewer but a part of it ...or where I am the who knocks :) Its a trip down your innermost fears , desires , ambitions , conflicts and confusion in all of it.<br/><br/>I had always been fan of Stanely Kubrick like "Grey Matter" movies which are both nerdy and also shows humans not in brackets of good vs evil but in a more nuanced thousand shades of grey . This movie is all about transformation of a human from white into grey to dark grey to black ; slowly methodically just like chemistry and once done you cant even determine who is black or who is white . Its all then becomes a single compound of humans ...Greedy n selfish ,filled with frustration, anger ,confusion and more subtle desire to be respected , to feel important , to feel love and to care for the family. All of them when mixed with right ingredients of cancer hopelessness gives a high of power from where there is no point of return. Once you get it there are no more moral or ethical boundaries left. No judgements to be made. Its all dark but sadly its closest to real world we live in.<br/><br/>If Kubrick has ever made a TV series i bet that would be something like Breaking Bad. Its epitome of what TV series can do and raises a bar for other great series like BBC's Sherlock. It mixes human emotions in a cocktail so never seen before. It metamorphosis a human from white into black with erosion of its soul and rusting of its moral compass. Its all that who all wish to be on the inside. Its a chemical formula to give us a high into our deepest desires ...just like meth :) I was little disappointed by end though, felt very typical Hollywood style and little out of touch. A darker end where either Jesse & Walt dies in captivity or oblivion would have more satisfying .<br/><br/>Nevertheless this is a TV series which gives a better high than snorting meth :) After watching the eighth episode of Season 5, I can say for certain that Breaking Bad is the best show on television till now. Being in India, you hardly get to watch these sort of TV shows amidst our traditional flagrant family dramas with absolutely nothing to offer. This is by far the most realistic show I've ever witnessed. Bryan Cranston is amazing in the character of Walter White. He continues to impress with his acting, his shady parley and his performance in the black comedy scenes.<br/><br/>This is the story of Mr. White, an inventive chemistry professor who endures cancer and eventually teams up with Pinkman (Aaron Paul) to launch the purest Crystal Meth in the market. His journey transforms him from a modest human being into a menacing individual who will stop at nothing to provide a better life for his family and keeping his disguise intact with his in-laws and the rest of the world as a modest and humble being who is fighting cancer. Although he succeeds with almost everyone, his wife eventually finds out and his family gets secluded from him. But he stops at nothing to fulfill his dream of building an empire of his own which leads him to accomplish even more perilous deeds. The important message that this show conveys that no matter how hard you try to suppress a rogue endeavor, the truth will ultimately reveal itself in the long run.<br/><br/>This is an amazing achievement in TV history. All other actors including Anna Gunn, Aaron Paul, Dean Norris, Giancarlo Esposito and Jonathan Banks gives stand out performances. This is not a show for everybody though. It is mature and perfected for grown-ups but it is not to be missed under any circumstances. All I can say to the producers of this show is - Thank you & Keep 'em coming.<br/><br/>A must see. 10/10. Honestly I have to say that this is the best TV-series I have ever seen. I simply can't find a fault in it. The story is very interesting and it is developing so well and after all it is even quite plausible. <br/><br/>Walter White is great, as well as Jesse Pinkman, and there is nothing bad to say about the other characters either. This whole being quiet thing though remains as a question; for me as a Scandinavian it is OK and natural, but I have always thought that the Americans are just not capable of that. But perhaps it really is like that in a professional drug business, no empty words are said or nothing unnecessary. In a way I just love this mysteria this creates, people come and go, some even keeping themselves totally unknown. Everything is not explained and totally covered like in some series.<br/><br/>What I especially love is how these characters develop. From the beginning to the close of end it is sometimes hard to even imagine them to be the same actors, same characters. But in the end that is how it goes in real life too; someone you used to know five years ago might not be at all the same... People change so quickly, especially under the pressure. This is my first review about any thing and i couldn't be more grateful that it's about breaking bad . it's without a doubt the best thing that ever happened on TV . the leading actor Bryan Cranston is in my own opinion one of the best actors in Hollywood right now .this guy will make you experience a roller coaster of emotions through the whole show .the entire cast is just amazing and each of the characters are perfectly developed and written .the thing about TV shows that i don't like is that sometimes they sort of lose track at the end it's like their curve is going up and down through the seasons well i can assure you that you will not see this on breaking bad ,this show will just keep rising and rising till the last second of it .breaking bad is a must see phenomena . from the first season it's an addiction and you can't stop watching it . don't hesitate for a second to start it right now . I have never seen a show so dark, so violent, so brutally realistic and become so invested that I can't get enough of it. Nothing like this. Screw Malcolm in the Middle, this is Brian Cranston's true performance of a lifetime. He delivered such emotion worth receiving a dozen Oscars. And his transformation really is unbelievably stunning swinging from nerdy chemistry teacher to daring and threatening criminal, but he still sympathetic and human. A lot of us may disagree with some of the choices he makes as the world's greatest meth cook but at least we understand why he's doing it, which makes us think to ourselves: what would you do if you had no money to support your family and you have no medical insurance for your lung cancer, which is what he's got? What choice would you be making in situations like this? I think that's the moral of this story: consequences, sacrifices, and most of all 'choice'. It makes you think of what path to take to support your family if there were no other alternatives. I think about a lot.<br/><br/>Everything works: the story, the tone, the timing, the casting, and the chief of it's success, the acting. Not once does it feel like somebody's winking at the camera, everybody is firmly focused. It's a great show with a great lesson: choice. Some TV dramas deserve 10's and this is one of them. May be the greatest TV drama ever written. May be better than the Sopranos. Visceral, scary, exhilarating, funny, excitingly vengeful,sad, pitiful, intelligent... .<br/><br/>Never has any two actors so filled the screen in one show and grabbed one than both stars with Cranston grabbing more due to his incredibly stellar screen presence, but I think we are in for surprises from Paul in future roles.<br/><br/>Cranston was born for this role. Cranston was born to act and does so with such convincing conviction I never thought he was acting at any point. The same goes for Paul and really, most every other actor, including Norris who was stellar and Gunn, Brandt and Mitte.<br/><br/>Yes I'm gushing but who doesn't with such a great show.<br/><br/>Thanks AMC. Your the channel to beat nowadays. Yes. A Masterpiece. The full essence of the human condition and the opening of the Dark Door that lies in all of us. What would we do? How far do we go doing what we think it's the right thing even when everything starts to fall apart? Can we keep our goals or will we always want more and more? Can we stop? Can we give up? What will we do to protect the ones we love from the pain and suffering we caused them? Was it worth it?<br/><br/>This is the show. If you haven't watched it yet PLEASE DO and don't give up on it. Each episode is perfectly made and the Ending well... for me it was the best ending ever of a TV Show, you will not be disappointed and when you finish watching it you'll just stand up and scream not knowing if crying of happiness or sadness..<br/><br/>"If that's true and you don't know who I am... then maybe, your best course would be to... tread lightly" - Walter White I've never been so addicted by a TV American drama series like Breaking Bad. This was an all new experience that I started the past year and finished some minutes ago. This was something that many of my friends had experienced with some shows that fascinated their minds, but were always not so interesting for me. I am more a guy of movies, but Breaking Bad caught me by surprise, and changed my entire life. I never saw anything like this and, I presume, I will not see, from now on, anything that could be so good as Breaking Bad. I'm so grateful to the genius Vince Gilligan, who created a story and characters that are so human (and that is what people most like to see on TV, that's for sure) and to the great actors and technicians that made this "magnum opus" be possible. Thanks to Breaking Bad, I changed my way about drama fiction in American television business, and it make me belief that, despite the economic interests of the guys who just want to know about the damn ratings, there is always space in networks for works that are made with intelligence. Because is shows like Breaking Bad that make that history, the History of Television and the History of the creativity of the humankind and the imagination. imagination that has to be seen as an important factor for the creation of great art. Yes, because Breaking Bad is art, from beginning to end. THANK YOU GUYS!<br/><br/>From a great Portuguese fan, Rui. It was one of those Netflix nights when my friend suggested a show called Breaking Bad. Reading the description, I did not know what my eyes were about to witness. I was thinking to myself, "A show about a chemistry teacher who finds out he has cancer... and becomes a drug dealer?" We watched the first episode and I thought it was great, but it was awhile before I got back to it... but once I took the time to show that first episode to my boyfriend, we proceeded to watch the next episode. <br/><br/>It was at the end of that second episode when we looked at each other wide-eyed. I was about to utilize the majority of my time watching this show, unable to deny watching the next episode... then the next... then the next... <br/><br/>This show defines pure genius. Not only is every actor on this show PERFECTION at playing their characters, but the story will blow your mind with each and every tear jerking, heart pounding episode. You will never see what's coming. And you'll definitely never know who's going to break bad next - or be the victim. <br/><br/>No, this show isn't just about a chemistry teacher who finds out he has cancer who becomes a meth dealing legend. It's three episodes away from being the end - and I feel that we'll all find our own meaning for this work of art. You'll cry. You'll laugh. You'll feel the pain of all the characters at once - and in the end, you'll probably be rooting for someone you thought you'd never root for. <br/><br/>So if you're having one of those Netflix nights, don't scroll past Breaking Bad. I can assure you'll be hooked after the end of the first episode, if not sooner. If I could rate this more than 10, I would because it's worthy of more than you can imagine. Compared to the other great TV shows, Breaking Bad is spare and stripped-down. The creator seems to have taken a very basic literary form -- the classical tragedy in five acts -- and set out to expose the self-destructive hubris at the heart of one of the greatest TV characters of all time. Walter White is the White Whale to Hank, and Lear to himself. I don't actually know how it's going to end, but it plays with the foreknowledge of tragedy we have in our gut (those flash- forwards are a particularly good way of evoking this feeling). Contrast it with, say, The Killing, where absolutely nothing was predictable, which left viewers feeling played with. Maybe we actually like shows that have some element of predictability.<br/><br/>It's easy to see just how completely this show breaks the TV mold by slicing away the other genres that have both enriched and bloated pop entertainment: soap opera, novelistic realism, black comedy. For all its greatness, The Sopranos was bloated with soapy elements; The Wire, greater still, was committed to a certain kind of naturalism; Weeds always had the complex tone associated with black comedy, and (completely failing to sustain that complexity) eventually degenerated into a sitcom. You don't get any of this with Breaking Bad: there are just a few larger-than-life characters (no wasted ones, really), and a pretty small universe. It mostly looks like it's been made on a post- recession shoestring budget (at least compared to AMC's inferior costume drama Mad Men). It is brilliantly acted and directed. Seldom, if ever, does a simple television show reach and exploit the dramatic heights and potential of its medium. <br/><br/>It does this using two of the most unlikely and unassuming individuals in the business to carry across to the viewers their journey; to trust in them the goal of making that journey worth following. <br/><br/>Breaking Bad does that. The writing is simple and powerful; written in both detailed and broad strokes. Nothing is said without deep meaning behind it. The most simple and innocuous interactions have symbolic meaning. You won't be cheated.<br/><br/>It seems it would be nearly impossible for any age or gender to watch this show without feeling its theme in their bones; pertinent to them. <br/><br/>Life, death, ultimate meaning ... right, wrong. Love, lies, manipulation .. and power. <br/><br/>The cinematography is worth watching the series alone for. It's crystal clear, stunning Western portraits ... extended shots, absolute beauty to match absolute corruption.<br/><br/>Nothing means anything without characters who are memorable. We care deeply about these characters: Particularly the two leads, Walter and Jessie. I don't think anybody would/could have imagined the evolution Walter's character was capable of, let alone that of Jessie's. It's not a show that's been dragged out for money, it's not a show that was cut short. It's just right.<br/><br/>Seldom do you see this level of beauty through this medium. It transcends its medium. Would it be too much to ask for a movie ... to follow the series? If not, I will not complain. I'll be re-watching the show for years to come.<br/><br/>Masterpiece. if you haven't yet watched Breaking Bad, you are missing out on the best writing, acting, pushing-the-envelope, gripping, thrilling drama out there in t.v. land. absolutely superb and shocking. i'm so proud of amc for taking a chance on this show. the second season was even better than the first and that's a tough nut to crack. i was a bit taken aback in reading the IMDb summary statement on this show - i don't find the main character to be in a "mid-life crisis" but rather a life & death crisis of provision for his family. i find him innately unselfish which is in complete opposition to a mid-life crisis. not the greatest job in summary of such a stellar piece of narrative genius. <br/><br/>i won't spoil further other than to say...get on itunes and rent seasons 1 & 2 soon! season 3 starts in just 2 weeks!!! a couple of days ago i started watching breaking bad not my kind of show i thought but i tried it and i can't stop bryan cranston is incredible one of the greatest actors i've seen in a while even if you don't think you would like this show believe me when i say you will and not only bryan cranston but his supporting actor aaron paul who i grew up on in movies such as ''whatever it takes'' ''van wilder'' and ''big love'' he evens the playing field on this show a truly great cast and script drives this show and i'm only half way through the second season. so believe me when i say this is a show that every single episode takes you somewhere new a makes you watch every episode from start to finish. Alongside Mad Men, Breaking Bad is probably one of the best TV series out to date. The cinematography and storytelling are topnotch, surpassing the quality of many films.<br/><br/>Characters range from the quirky to the downright sinister. Bryan Cranston from Malcolm in the Middle dissolves completely into his role. He has an everyman likability that continues even as his character descends into inhumanity. The believability of the situation is vital to the show, and all of the other actors do an excellent job of maintaining it.<br/><br/>Stylistically, it's a bit reminiscent of the Coen Brothers, there are certain changes from episode to episode which make things more interesting. <br/><br/>It'd be ideal to start watching it from the beginning, however any one episode will pull you quickly into the story. Sometimes there is a weak plot point here or there, but its makes the show all the more unpredictable. As I watched BB I discovered foreshadowing, subtle messages, symbolism, and moral dilemmas which I won't go into detail here. <br/><br/>Overall, Breaking Bad is a unique show packed with humor, action, and drama that will appeal to a wide audience. The storytelling, though, is always central, as it should be. 1/ Because it makes other shows look bad <br/><br/>2/ Because it makes other Emmy nominations in acting categories look hopeless <br/><br/>3/ Because it makes the loser characters look cool and smart <br/><br/>4/ Because it makes the righteous acts look dumb and stupid <br/><br/>5/ Because it makes the horrible crimes look cool and justify <br/><br/>6/ Because it makes the impossible incidents look reasonable <br/><br/>7/ Because it makes desperation looks humour <br/><br/>8/ Because it makes the naive definitions of colour and symbol look so important <br/><br/>9/ Because it makes the simple dialogues looks meaningful in many different layers <br/><br/>10/ Because it makes a simple plot looks so complex and interesting <br/><br/>11/ Because it makes the sacred relationships look invaluable and disrespectful <br/><br/>12/ Because it makes one of the most decent society in the world look desperate, horrible and invaluable <br/><br/>13/ Because it makes dumb and naive viewers thought they were smart and special <br/><br/>"This is must see TV" that's all you need to see it as fast as you have a chance since the season 4 is coming now. Past three seasons had created a die hard fans base over the world. From the acting, the direction to the unique style combining from the classic gangster dramas in history of motion pictures such as The Godfather, Scar Face, Pulp Fiction, No country for old men, Fargo etc...... Breaking bad shows us the new golden generation of cable TV drama by the brilliant creator Vince Gilligan and multi Emmy winner Bryan Cranston<br/><br/>The plot is simple. An underachieved middle class chemistry teacher name Walter White, lives in a small town of a common state in US. Who also has incurable cancer and a family which he can't afford.<br/><br/>Then.....he decided to break bad <br/><br/>Within the desperation and honorific, Walt and his ex student Jesse Pinkman took us to a hilarious journey but no short of thrill and suspension name "How to transform from loser to a Godfather!! For dummy!!" <br/><br/>AMC really makes it' slogan: "Future American classic TV drama" This is another one of those shows that a staggering majority of viewers regard as perfect. It's not. it's slightly above average, then the character interactions begin to take on a daytime TV feel and it becomes utter trash. <br/><br/>People bicker endlessly. Walter's wife becomes a complete brat and stays that way for the rest of the series. When Walter's not having it out with a spouse that desperately needs a beating, he's having it out with his partner in crime. The show continues in this fashion for a grueling 5 seasons with occasional breaks in the low brow Jerry Springeresque drama for an interesting moment before it goes right back to it.<br/><br/>You want good TV? Watch Dexter. Watch Fringe. Watch GoT or Mr. Mercedes or Mindhunter.<br/><br/>The show had potential. It wasted it and turned to drivel. So I finished Breaking bad. And it was one of the weirdest most unbalanced things I've seen.<br/><br/>Season 1- really really good, Season 2- boringggg, Season 3- slightly less boring, Season 4- So so up until the final really good 2 episodes, Season 5- mad as a box of frogs. Everyone gets whacked and it's more entertaining than anything in all four earlier seasons.<br/><br/>Pleased I watched it but probably not again.<br/><br/>I should add, acting from Cranston and co was great, the cinematography and editing excellent But the writing? I think we can see where the 'Method acting' took place. Free meth in the writers room anyone? I borrowed Season 1 and 2 of Breaking Bad from a friend after hearing the rave reviews and the 9.5/10 star rating on IMDb. I had high expectations for this show, thinking it would be on par with a show like Dexter. Unfortunately, it failed to deliver.<br/><br/>I watched 10 episodes in total. The entire Season 1 and the first three episodes of Season 2. It just failed to grab me. I felt like the episodes were slow, dragged out ideas that the writers attempted to stretch out for as long as they possibly could. There are hardly any background story lines going on, so you only see the main story line, stretched out so much it's really boring.<br/><br/>Normally after I watch episodes of a new show, I am left with anticipation for the next episode. Like a good book you can't put down. Breaking Bad didn't do this to me. In fact, I was so bored that I stopped Season 2 after three episodes. I couldn't torture myself anymore. <br/><br/>If you're interested in Breaking Bad, I suggest you give it a go. But don't have high expectations because you'll probably be let down. I'm not one to usually give a bad rating on something unless I've observed it with all my might. but this show really is overrated, I'm sorry if that upsets people as so many of them think this show is amazing and have taken it upon themselves to call it one of the best in history, but yet after pushing through to the third season of Breaking Bad, I still couldn't see the appeal. Many of my friends have said it's amazing and it would get me hooked within the first episode...to say that didn't happen was an understatement. <br/><br/>I really wanted to like it, I really did, but Walter White played by Bryan Cranston portrayed this painful character to watch; He was twitchy and anxious all the time (which I understand because the show is trying to make it as realistic as possible and being nervous comes with the part of playing a drug lord)which pauses me to wonder why Walt couldn't just be cool about it all, he's a rookie, I get that and he has a lot to lose, and I'm not denying him the courtesy of admitting that how he acted was true enough, but why couldn't he just drop out and work in a chem lab somewhere that earns him big bucks? I'm sure a man with his caliber and education could get a high end job, his friend owns a company that was part his, couldn't he have just asked for a job that pays him a lot within the company? I don't know if I'm just being naive here but, think about it. Anyway it was all still frustrating to watch, I felt the writers should have brought out more of his brilliant smart side than focus mainly on the family-man side of him. <br/><br/>The show had good themes and the plot really never got old speaking honestly, but it's as Walter said, they take a step forward and two steps back, THE WHOLE TIME. I don't think people knew how annoying that was, all I wanted to see was this badass character that was mathematically ingenious and a chem whiz, but unfortunately that was only shown little of. I hated that Walt's genius didn't come out more often and so I got tired of the teasing quite quickly; he would pull this stunt where he figures acid to dissolve bodies, get beans that would poison people, build car batteries from nuts and bolts, make Meth from scratch and you would get this thrill that makes you want to keep watching forever and then bam! his wife calls and the illusion shatters. Speaking of Skylar, that woman drove me mad! although again I understand she was playing the role of a realistic wife, and still I found that frustrating. Her character portrayal was...abysmal. that's all I'll say.<br/><br/>The show in general was repetitive, bad guy, defeat bad guy, make meth, get rich. and then he falls to his demise. so after 5 seasons, Walter gets nothing in the end. Hey producers, just a little shout-out, you want to make this show realistic, right? Realism promotes predictability! If people were surprised by that ending, you'll find me with my face in my palm. <br/><br/>anyway, to round this up, it was a bad show, that I would have liked to watch had it been more interesting than Walter having an aneurysm every time the DEA mentioned drugs. just sayin'. People are STILL talking about Breaking Bad, long after the series finale, and I just wanted to write a bad review partly out of spite, but mostly out of confusion. I'm confused by the seemingly universal love for this show... <br/><br/>I'm a big film/television fan, and I love large-scale, epic drama more than my own mother, but Breaking Bad just never really did it for me. I have watched every episode of Game of Thrones at least 4 times, and I could watch them again without nodding off once, but I struggled to make it through a season of BB spread out over the course of a month. It became a chore to watch it, like it was obligatory.<br/><br/>I will give credit where it's due, and say that Bryan Cranston gave a phenomenal performance.<br/><br/>That being said, outstanding performances are in no short supply in television these days, and they can be found in series that are - wait for it - more original. Yes, this series is praised for its originality, but the "middle class parent turned drug dealer" bit has been done before. Granted, not to the scale of BB, but the premise IS unoriginal. What happens when you just don't give a sh*t anymore? You have been diagnosed with a terminal disease and you have found out that your days are numbered.<br/><br/>Would you try to enjoy the rest of your short life by doing everything you've always dreamed of? Perhaps travelling to Paris to see the Eiffel Tower or going on safari in Africa? Too clichÃ©d? What about a trip 'down under' to go swimming among the corals of Australia's Great Barrier Reef? Or maybe you would go to a paradise island for that round of golf you always talked about.... <br/><br/>Well, not for Walter White. For him the answer was obvious. You start cooking 'crystal meth'!<br/><br/>Set in Albuquerque, New Mexico, 'Breaking Bad' tells the story of a 50 year old chemistry teacher, White, who is confronted with the dreadful news that he has lung cancer and the grim prognosis estimates that he has two years left to live. This causes him to reflect on how his wife Skyler, and son Walter Junior will cope financially without him since they have an outstanding mortgage and sizeable medical bills to pay. Desperate times call for desperate measures and he decides he will make enough money from his new enterprise as a drug manufacturer to secure his family's finances for times when he is not around to provide for them. These actions introduce a new reckless side to his personality and lead him to invent a power seeking alter-ego he calls 'Heisenberg'. This name quickly gains notoriety on the streets. Bryan Cranston is outstanding as White and delivers a performance that is equally convincing when he is playing the high school teacher who is enduring a cancer battle and as the vulnerable wannabe kingpin of a drug empire. <br/><br/>Aaron Paul plays White's former student, Jesse Pinkman. He becomes his dealer and later 'business partner'. Their tumultuous relationship is at the epicentre of the show and viewers may find their constant arguing becomes a source of irritation after a couple of episodes.<br/><br/>Add to the mix White's brother-in-law Hank, who is brilliantly played by Dean Norris. He works for the DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration). Hank is hell-bent on catching this 'Heisenberg' character who he has been hearing about and who has been producing a unique blue coloured high quality methamphetamine as his signature product. <br/><br/>As things progress White and Pinkman get deeper into an underworld that has drugs as a currency and we find out that criminals in Albuquerque come from varying backgrounds, ranging from street users and Mexican cartels to white collar professionals.<br/><br/>Although it has its moments, 'Breaking Bad' is essentially a slow moving family drama with a sprinkling of crime thrown in. A lot of time is spent developing the characters of Skyler, Walter Junior and Marie (Hank's wife and Skyler's sister). This is obviously an attempt to attract a wider audience and also to contrast suburban family life with that of a drug manufacturing criminal but it does detract from the excitement of the show by slowing the pace and besides, it was done first and probably better in 'The Sopranos'. What 'Breaking Bad' does do well though, is to challenge viewers into making judgements about characters and to weigh up their morality. <br/><br/>As we are introduced to new characters who are either consuming the drugs or making money off them, it becomes clear that the writers have been careful not to glamorize drug use by showing the negative impacts it has on the lives of every character in the show. For the peripheral characters we see disgusting drug dens with stick thin users squatting on abandoned apartment floors. Their gaunt facial appearances showcase the effects of drug use with dark rings under their eyes, acne type sores with ooze about to break the skin and teeth that have become discoloured and rotten. Not a good look. The lead actors are fresh faced and somewhat photogenic however, and one can only assume that viewers would be turned off if Jesse and his friends were presented in that way. The ramifications of being involved in drugs are more evident in the strained and tense way the central characters relate to the people they care about.<br/><br/>With regards to the main storyline, it becomes difficult to fathom that Hank would not have worked out that his brother-in-law was behind this new high quality drug. White is a chemistry teacher, apparatus has gone missing from his lab and he has been buying pot from a known dealer. Later he drives his family car to a lab where both he and Pinkman are 'cooking'. Bearing in mind that the DEA already suspect Pinkman of being the producer of the meth' wouldn't they have followed him and been led to White? For the price of a tank of gas they would have their man! As things start to get less realistic it becomes more difficult for viewers to buy it. The story lines that is, not the Meth'! This show is stupid. It's a stupid show full of stupid Americans for stupid Americans. It fails when it tries to create any suspense and the plot is unbelievable. All of this show is terrible and a complete and utter waste of time. I regret every hour I spent watching this crap and it deserves none of the hype it has been given.<br/><br/>The characters are probably some of the worst, most unlikable, retarded characters I've even seen. Walt is a horrible person, Skyler is a stupid *insert word for a female dog here* (point in case, a shortened version of a scene. Ted: 'I don't want your money' Skyler: 'Are you blackmailing me Ted? Do you want more money?'), Jesse is pathetic man-child. Walt Jr just jumps on the bandwagon of hate, Marie is just a time filler and Hank a terrible cop who is incredibly insecure.<br/><br/>The only likable points in this show is when Gus walks out of the explosion seemingly unharmed, adjusts his tie then the camera shows his scorched face and he falls down dead and the scene where Mr.Minerals gets killed by Nazis. Hank Dying was my favourite scene as I hated him. I feel hatred towards the death of Gus as it led to the point where season 4 fizzled like a fuse on a damp firework and 'everything is going to be okay'. But oh no, the flower used to poison the child, the tension is palpable as a chemist isn't smart enough to throw away a goddamn potted plant (!) (sarcasm if you couldn't guess)<br/><br/>All in all, terrible plot, terrible characters, terrible writing. As someone who has been watching TV for a long time I can safely say that Breaking Bad is the greatest of them all.<br/><br/>Every aspect of the show is phenomenal.<br/><br/>The acting, of course, is top notch. The writing is brilliant and never predictable.<br/><br/>The cinematography is gorgeous. I have driven through Albuquerque and it is certainly not as memorable as the makes it out to be. That is a compliment to show, not a knock on the city itself.<br/><br/>Another important thing the show-runners did to make Breaking Bad stand out is to know when to end it. Lesser shows extend themselves beyond the point where the quality can't be maintained. Breaking Bad is a rare gem that will remembered and studied for years. Quite recently I have heard / read about this series critically acclaimed success from friends and newspapers. Therefore I've started watching all 62 episodes within a week in long night sessions. This is one of those series where the less you know about it going in, the better! Let me honestly say I've got addicted a few seconds after i've started with the pilot episode. This wasn't a series for me anymore but also a long thrilling movie I couldn't turned off. Perfect story, plots, characters, actors and actresses, filming locations, ... The story is brutal and comedic at the same time. The soundtrack rocks! Creator Vince Gilligan is truly a genius! <br/><br/>BREAKING BAD will set the high standard for a long, long time. I count myself lucky that I'd just gotten into "Breaking Bad" when the final season hysteria hit. For several weeks, you couldn't surf the web without hearing about this show, and everyone and their mother were championing it as the greatest thing to hit the airwaves since ... forever. That kind of hype can kill interest in anything, and it's exactly what turned me off of "LOST". <br/><br/>That said, it didn't take long for the show to win me over. And the biggest reason (among many) to recommend this to anyone is the dazzling plot twists. I can't tell you how many times I was mad at the screen when the credits rolled on an episode. They kicked this thing off with one hell of a pilot (one of the greats), but it had me frequently asking asking "Where will this go from here?" So he cooked the meth, now what? The sale of which would connect Walt and Jesse with a fast-food operator/drug kingpin and then onto an international conglomerate. "Breaking Bad" instilled in me the driving need to see how this story played out. So above all, the writing is incredible. <br/><br/>And aside from the terrific acting (across the board; it's a showcase of top-tier talent), you can't help but be taken with the show's cinematography. When it's not the eye-popping clouds of the Albuquerque skies (a city that adds heaps of character to the show), it's the creative opening shots and choices in framing that add layers to the story. This show was a treat for the eyes. <br/><br/>And as far as the final season goes, I can understand the fervor. It's that good. Nail-biting and (sometimes) very hard to watch, but it absolutely measures up. Particularly with "Ozymandias". That episode had me wound up, heartbroken, and seething all within minutes. <br/><br/>Phenomenal show. <br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>One more thing: the character of Walter White. I think it's remarkable how they actually developed him from nebbish chemistry teacher to Scarface drug kingpin. But I didn't care about him nearly as much as I did Jesse, and the punishment that poor kid endured through the course of this show is rough, man. But I'm also glad things turned out the way they did. The right people paid dearly, and the right people were set free. This show is a true work of art... <br/><br/>The story, the acting, the drama, the irony, the poetic moments, the subtleties, the way it is directed... Everything! It's very hard to find flaws in a show like this, when all these elements unite in a single, beautiful masterpiece.<br/><br/>If you haven't watched it yet, watch it! You will laugh, you will cry, you will enjoy a story full of surprising twists, meaningful subtleties, suspense, drama, tragedy, poetry, and a brilliant ending, with absolutely no loose ends.<br/><br/>This show must be watched and re-watched. It undoubtedly deserves the ranking 10. This is and will always be a great premise. Older guy who has nothing to lose starts kicking some seriously bad butt. Over the past few years there has been some really great examples of this. Gran Torino with Clint Eastwood, is for me, Clint's best work to date and will be a hard one to beat. Harry Brown with Michael Caine could be classed as the British version and is every bit as good. There is just something about watching a man maybe past his time in society come back and show everyone they are a force to be reckoned with. A man with nothing to lose is certainly a huge part of what makes up Breaking Bad.<br/><br/>Walter White is a high school chemistry teacher who could of been so much more. The man is a chemistry genius and has had chances throughout his life to really make something of his career, but alas life got in the way. He is happily married with a 16 year old son, who has cerebral palsy but doesn't let it bother him, and a baby on the way. The premise of the show is that Walt is diagnosed with lung cancer and it may be terminal. He needs to go through chemo and radiation which his insurance will not cover. Walt needs to A) find money for the treatments and B) find a way to be able to provide for his family when he is gone. By chance, Walt stumbles upon the methamphetamine world. Producing crystal meth is basically good old fashioned chemistry, something Walt lives and breathes.<br/><br/>There are a few concerns for Walt. Obviously he can't tell his wife or son what he is doing. They would flip. But he has to somehow come up with stories of where the money is coming from. Also, Walts brother in law is a DEA Agent whose primary job is the fight against the methamphetamine world in which Walt has just immersed himself in. Jessie, Walts new found partner in crime, is a young junkie, dealer who doesn't know as much as Walt would of first assumed. But the major concern for Walt is his fight against himself. The fight not to become a criminal, the battle not to become bad.<br/><br/>Walt is played by Bryan Cranston. If you've seen Drive with Ryan Gosling, Bryan Cranston is his mechanic boss with a limp, who seems to always get himself in trouble with the wrong people. Cranston is ridiculously good in this and plays the role to perfection. The ups and downs, decisions and desperations he has to go through would be a mean feat for any actor. Jesse is played by Aaron Paul, who as the episodes and seasons go on, certainly equals Cranston's ability in the acting arena. Everyone in the series is very well cast and does a wonderful job in their part of the story.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad is very well directed but it's the writing that is so wonderfully entertaining. The series has brilliantly thought out highs and lows and the story retains a very real feel, which considering some of the occurrences is genius. There is also quite a bit of humour thrown in which at times is totally hilarious and lightens the mood ever so slightly. Watch out for Saul Goodman.<br/><br/>I had been told a few times by friends that this series was very good, but it took me a long time to get around to it. I picked up for first season only 3 weeks ago and have now finished all four. I have been completely engrossed in this show and over the past 3 weeks have really wanted to watch nothing else. filmnotion.com Seasons 1 and 2 have recently been shown on UK digital TV on the "Five USA" channel. They've packed the whole lot into about ten weeks, and I have been gripped since the first seconds.<br/><br/>I've never seen anything like this, and I've never seen any series cram so much "story" into each episode. The characters, for the most part, are completely believable - you've met them all yourselves. Their actions are completely consistent with their characters. If you can accept Walter's initial decision to build up a cash nest-egg for the family he is expecting to leave destitute, then everything that happens seems to follow inevitably. There's no way back, you're at the bottom of a hole you've dug for yourself, and all the alternatives to "keep digging" will have even more horrendous consequences.<br/><br/>I didn't think I'd see anything better than "The Wire", but if this one can maintain it's standard through season 3 and onwards, it may well run it close. "Breaking Bad" is up there with "The Sopranos" and "Dexter" as outstanding entertainment. This is very black humour, interlaced with the tragedy of both strong and ineffective personalities being forced to take actions they know are wrong and really don't want to do. Every decision, however logical it may seem, leads to a situation where yet another unpalatable decision has to be made.<br/><br/>It's a bit like real life. I finished the show about 3 weeks ago, and I have to ask... Why does everyone seem to love it so much? In my book, it never came close to leaving a mark on television history. The only reason I finished it is because I was persuaded into doing so.. And admittedly, I was a little curious about how it would end with Aaron Paul's character. Which by the way, is a fantastic actor. And the same thing could be said about the rest of the crew.<br/><br/>So I'm not saying that the acting is bad, neither is the writing. In fact, it's brilliant. The whole concept is brilliant in it's very own way. It had a very realistic touch to it. So I don't blame the actors, I don't blame the writing team or the producers.. I blame this generation!!!<br/><br/>You're not supposed to watch television solely because of the acting or the story.. You're not supposed to watch television because of the realism.. You're supposed to watch it because you want to escape the boring everyday routines that haunts us all, aka real life!!<br/><br/>Despite the brilliance of this show, it was barely entertaining at all. It had some moments that's worth remembering, but overall I found it dull and boring.. Probably the most overrated show of the century. Cheers! Absolutely amazing show. If you're one of the seven people that haven't yet seen this show, let's make that number go down to six. People frequently talk about the decline of television, "Back in my day, we had good shows I Love Lucy, now there's only Jersey Shore and American Idol." This show cancels out any garbage "reality" shows that are on TV right now. Many consider this show to be another anti-hero show, and I'd have to disagree. Without spoiling anything, the main character of this show, Walter White, has very little redeemable qualities by the end of the final season. While this is listed as Drama, this show is not some boring cop procedural, it can be viewed as a (very) Dark Comedy if you want it to be. Only Game of Thrones has achieved as much adoration since Breaking Bad, and I love GoT, but this is just better. "Breaking Bad" is one poignant, riveting, 60-hour long story of a single man's desperation. If you can make it past the first four episodes...you will simply find it addictive and hard to stop watching, once you understand the story's general premise. In fact, you'll have a marathon Netflix watching party, to the very end. <br/><br/>The acting and storyline is written and executed with meticulous precision and relevant accuracy. This is closer to reality, than ANY staged "reality show" currently on TV. If you ever wanted to know what the destructive effects of Methamphetamine is....."Breaking Bad" will send you on a one-way journey to Hell. There is NO return. The wake of death and destruction of everybody involved is so completely represented with this series. I cannot begin to conceive ways it could be depicted any more vividly. <br/><br/>Watch "Breaking Bad" with a clear, open mind and realize there is no "religious" destination known as Hell - it's made by man.... How could I give less then 10 to one of the best TV series of all time??? Breaking Bad surely is already recognized as a masterpiece and one show that will be remembered for a long time. Having a story so original and so bold that is very hard to not like it watching just one episode. The high number of nominations and awards received by the show is just a glimpse of what this series has represented so far.<br/><br/>With a production and direction so good in creating an environment to the show be forged, the performance of the cast in the creation and development of the characters, even those who become relevant in future seasons, are made in a such extraordinary way. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul do an outstanding performance, presenting us with two characters that already have become iconic and memorable in people's mind.<br/><br/>The only bad aspect of the series is that is already over. Of course I would like to have more episodes, but the way which the show were built until the season finale was perfect. A phenomenal series. It's perfect for what it is trying to achieve. Everything about the series is perfect, especially the final season. I can't really put it all into words, but I'll sum up as much as I can.<br/><br/>First I should mention arguably the biggest thing about the series; the characters. I disagree with most people, who say that Walter White (Bryan Cranston) starts off in season one as a purely good person. You can see in the very first episode that he has an evil inside of him. As soon as he hears about the lung cancer he's off on an evil route that there is no coming back from. Yes, he becomes more evil, but he was never really good. Not that this is a bad thing, he still does really develop and change from a pretty normal person into a criminal genius.<br/><br/>You can see, from Cranston's brilliant acting, how and when Walter gradually changes. You can see when a big development happens that changes his character just from a mere look. You don't even know the moment that he changes from getting money for his family after he dies to a man obsessed with becoming his infamous, meth-creating alter ego, Heisenburg. It happens so slowly and subtly.<br/><br/>Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) also goes under major character development. At first I wasn't sure about him. Being a meth-using street punk, but gradually you realise that all he really wants is friends and people who care about him and he can care for. After the series is through and almost everyone he loves has been murdered (which he eventually finds out is due to his own partner), you see a huge change of character. He goes from an outgoing, uncaring punk into a destroyed and broken young man. Walter White becomes more evil and strong from watching people die, whereas Jesse Pinkman becomes more good and broken.<br/><br/>Every character has undergone at least some character development, but only three went through huge development. The third is Skyler White (Anna Gunn). At first I thought that she'd be yet another generic female character, but as the series goes on we see her many layers of character and how everything changes her. She goes from a soft, loving wife who becomes scared of her husband, to a strong woman who hates her husband and is not scared of him, to a wife who begins to agree with her husband and takes a dark turn, back to being scared of her husband, back to her normal life and finally to disagreeing with her husband and leaving him. Each change has a permanent affect, breaking her down yet making her stronger, much like Walter.<br/><br/>Of course, a mention has to go out to all of the brilliantly created character who were played perfectly. These include Hank Schrader (Dean Norris), Marie Schrader (Betsy Brandt), Walter White Jr./Flynn White (RJ Mitte), Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkurk), Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks), Gustavo Fring (Giancarlo Esposito) and Steven Gomez (Steven Michael Quezada). All of these were perfectly written and performed. You couldn't ask for more.<br/><br/>The writing is what another thing makes the show so perfect. It takes the meth business to a whole new level and everything is so in depth. Each character, story and scene written so perfect. There have been so many fantastic writers, but the one with the biggest overall influence is the creator, Vince Gilligan. I don't know how the series was written at such a perfect pace, but it was, and all due to the writers.<br/><br/>Of course, I must mention the directing. You can feel a pseudo Western take to it. It feels western, just from the angles and effects on the shots, but it isn't. It's sort of half western mainly due to the nigh perfect directing. There have been many directors, but I feel that all of them got it spot on perfect, from the calmest to the tensest scenes.<br/><br/>While I don't think the music really adds much to this series, David Porter still makes it so noticeably well. Just hearing the pseudo western sounds will instantly make you think of Breaking Bad. While not overall outstanding musing above all else, it does still certainly hit the spot and was what the series needed to make it as good as it is.<br/><br/>I must admit, season one and most of season two bored me. '4 Days Out' had me hooked. The series got better as it went along in my opinion. Season five was possibly the best season/series of anything, ever. It hit everything perfect, you can't decide whether you love or hate a character. They've all broken bad, but you still see all of the good in them. You're not quite sure how you wanted the series to end up.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how I feel about the ending, but it couldn't have really ended any other way without being unrealistic. Episode fourteen and season five, 'Ozymandias', is certainly my favourite. It had me on edge throughout the entire episode. Every scene was perfect and changed everything. It was the episode that brought everything together and was, in my opinion, the beginning of the end. It certainly deserves its remarkable 10/10 on here from an outstanding forty seven thousand people.<br/><br/>Overall I think the series hit basically everything it wanted to perfectly. I don't know how they did it, but they perfected a series about a man breaking bad. Sure, each character broke down in chunks. I disagree with people who say that they all gradually broke down every episode. It was certain scenes and events that caused them to break down, but they all did it so well and realistically. This is a groundbreaking series everyone should watch. There are no other series out there that hits everything it strives to so perfectly. No, I don't think I have overused the word 'perfect'. I have never seen a show that I loved so much from the start until the very end. It never went down in quality, actually I feel it become even better in later seasons. And while not everything that was happening was what I liked, I still thought that it was done brilliantly. I am just sad it is over, I could go on watching it longer.<br/><br/>Created by Vince Gilligan, the show goes about a chemistry teacher Walter White who gets cancer and tries to make money for his family by getting together with his old student Jesse Pinkman and cook meth. The relationship between the two is one of my favorite parts of the show. They have such a great dynamics, so much chemistry (no pun intended) and seeing their friendship develop going through bumps etc. was beautiful.<br/><br/>All acting on the show is A class. Just as characters. So many different people very complex and greatly performed by the actors. This doesn't just go to the characters I loved, but even the ones who I didn't like, such as Walt's whole family. Their performances made the shows as great as it is just like the plot did.<br/><br/>And I must say, I found out some spoilers ahead of time. But watching the moments was still very intense and sort of unexpected. This shows how well it is done. The show is not only unpredictable because of "what happens" but also because of "how". Watch it! This is the best show of our time,impossible to not enjoy it and it will be a classic. I will try to follow the work of the creator and the actors from now on. Breaking Bad is a masterpiece, plain and simple. It stands toe-to-toe with the likes of The Wire, Mad Men, and The Sopranos in terms of smart writing, engaging characters, fantastic performances, and an immersive world. Not to mention, the show features my favorite acting performance of any medium, Bryan Cranston as Walter White.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most important point to mention is this does not feel like a TV show, but an experience that has been elevated above that plane with the help of impressive cinematography and equally impressive musical selection. It has a style to it that may not grip you at the start because we as a society have come to expect certain characteristics of TV shows that are not met here. Definitely by the end of the first season, however, you will be hooked, on the edge of your seat, waiting to see what happens to these characters. The best analogy I can make to better clarify is perhaps comparing Breaking Bad to the work of Tarantino and the Coen brothers. It's tense and violent, but also darkly comic at parts. Not to mention, there are many moments that will stick with you due to the show's incredible performances and style. I don't think I will ever forget the first time I watched the conclusion to the episode "Crawl Space" or the ending to the episode "One Minute." The show is a slow burn, but when that burn erupts, it spreads like wild fire, gripping you into its dark world.<br/><br/>Ultimately this show is a character study, taking an intelligent, but overall, normal family man, and turning him into a cold criminal. It delves into the psychology of his situation and engages the audience into asking themselves where they draw the line. As he deviates further and further from the norm, his crimes become more and more heinous. That being said, because we resonate so strongly with his characters original intentions, it is hard to condemn him for taking this terrible path. This complex show could have easily fallen apart if the lead performance did not reflect the complexity of the character, but luckily Bryan Cranston delivers episode after episode, more than deserving of his back-to-back-to-back Emmy wins. Even the supporting cast around him delivers. Aaron Paul's performances transcends our perceptions of his character at the start making him far more layered than we would have originally thought. Jonathan Banks creates a cool and slick killer... at the prime age of 60. Bob Odenkirk provides much comic relief while also supplying the later seasons with a moral compass, that is often ignored. Even the supporting roles of Anna Gunn and Betsy Brandt add to their seemingly one-dimensional characters and allow us to engage in their point of view on multiple viewings. I would be remiss to fail to mention Giancarlo Esposito, whose performance in season four rivals that of Cranston's making for one of my favorite supporting roles ever.<br/><br/>This is definitely a show to experience. Four and a half seasons in, and it has not missed a beat. Breaking Bad is the only show I can think of that gets better each successive season. It's characters become more engaging, the tension becomes more gripping, the dialogue becomes more thoughtful, and we as an audience are left in awe. The show will be ending come this summer and I can't wait to see the conclusion. Vince Gilligan has truly created a masterpiece. I live in Australia and was not aware that this show existed, it is not shown on commercial TV here, I was given Season 1 on DVD for Christmas, I have now just finished Season 4... this Drama has everything a viewer could want, but it has been crafted like no other drama series I've ever seen. I know it has comparison's to Weeds, Dexter and Sopranos, but comparing BB to these shows, just doesn't do Breaking Bad true justice. The best word I can come up with is "breathtaking", and for so many reasons, the writing, the character development, the performances, even the production values... Vince Gilligan must be Shakespeare's and The Coen brothers love child, there can be no other explanation, the combination of pathos and inventive story telling is remarkable. Every character good or bad has true hidden depth, a true to life mixture of every emotion it's possible to convey, what is so unnerving is that we see through to the true humanity of every meth head, dealer, prostitute or street urchin, even the hungry 7 year old in the crack house in season two was 'perfect'... Cranston is remarkable because he stands head and shoulders above the rest, his ability to convey to us as his audience every emotion he is feeling, while keeping everyone - family - friend or foe, completely in the dark about his true intentions, is just flawless. 10 out of 10 is not a high enough score for this true American classic. I believe season 5 will be the last? If so I applaud Gilligan for having the integrity to not let this show descend into commercialized dribble - knowing just when to finish a perfect portrait is the signature of a great artist. Was expecting good things from this as everybody kept going on about it and had some great actors in it, but was very disappointed. It took me 2 attempts to watch it all. 1st attempt I only got to season 2 ep2 and gave up because I was bored. 2nd time round I watched up to season 4 as people said that's when it got good (It didn't get any better as far as I was concerned) I only finished it because there was 1 season left to go. It may have been better if I had of watched it before sons of anarchy but I had watched sons of anarchy before breaking bad and in my opinion S.O.A takes some beating and breaking bad came nowhere close to it. It was very slow and to be honest it was kind of like the saying "same s**t different day". In my opinion this series started out brilliantly on a very interesting premise. But later I think the series started to lose its own credibility. It suffered from the same fate a lot of series have these days: they throw in everything they got at the start to actually make an impression. But that leaves them with only so much for the remaining seasons.<br/><br/>*** CONTAINS SPOILERS BELOW ***<br/><br/>After a few seasons, you know the trick and you start wondering how Walter and his unstable friend can dodge so many bullets. His sidekick Jesse started to become really obsolete, and quite frankly annoyed me up to the point that I was actually praying for some gang member to end his life sooner than later. A guy that is constantly nagging and feeling so sorry for himself is only interesting for so long. After that he just becomes annoying. Personally I think this is a result of just dragging on for far too long with a series on a same premise. It becomes a one-trick pony. It would've served the series better if they'd cut it down a season or two. As someone who is used to shows being touted as "life-changing" and "brilliant" I ignored all of the hype about this show until recently, when I saw that there was a museum devoted to art based on this show, not to mention a "First World Problems" meme where someone said that Breaking Bad made other television unwatchable. I just had to watch it.<br/><br/>Surprise! It's mediocre.<br/><br/>This is more "gangster" entertainment aimed at people who need gangster entertainment as escapist fantasy, but otherwise this isn't any different from other FANTASTIC TV THAT YOU CAN'T MISS that everyone forgets about as soon as it gets canceled. So many people recommended this to me but I kept reading bits about it and hesitating because it didn't sound very enthralling. Finally I gave in and watched Season 1 - and I was hugely disappointed. I only kept going with each episode because people kept saying it gets better & asking me to give it a chance and I'd love it. Well, sorry but I didn't. I had no connection to any of the characters in it and couldn't have cared less what happened to them. Many of the characters, particularly the women, were awful stereotypes with no depth. The script was boring, the plot was ridiculous and the cinematography & direction often irritating. One or two of the actors tried their best and were good but that isn't enough when the material is so woeful. Mostly tho the show just bored me to tears. <br/><br/>I have no clue why this is getting such rave reviews, awards etc. It feels like a case of the "The Emporer's New Clothes" to me where people are convinced it must be good because everyone else says so! And I've noticed anyone who writes a review on their blog/website that does anything short of praise this as the greatest TV series in history is inundated with the shows fans hurling childish badly worded abuse at them and suggesting they are "(offensive word of some sort) morons" etc. That disgustingly stupid behaviour in itself tells me more about the show than any review can. What we have here, in this show, is the art of character construction taken to perfection. Every single one of them is believable and their actions do not seem like fiction, on the contrary, it looks like they behave as anyone would if pushed to the same limits. But only good build characters wouldn't make this show what it is. Added to that, the directing was precise and the screenplay never gave to much, and put WOW moments in right amount and pace (there are a lot of twists, but the show doesn't rely on them to keep you watching it). <br/><br/>The show itself changes with its main character: it starts as a dark humor comedy, slowly changing into a drama and in the final seasons becoming sort of a thriller, but never losing the hallmark of the show: the character construction. Walter White doesn't becomes a crime genius all of a sudden, instead we see that evil was already inside of him in the beginning, he only lacks the motive to release it. Don't we all?<br/><br/>This, my friends, is a true 10/10. This is the difference between telling a story and dragging the spectator into one. Dear team of Breaking Bad, if you read this, tell everybody that I am sorry that I rated only with 10 , but IMDb vote drop-down menu has only ten stars.There should be added few more for this serial.Plot is full of turnovers, acting is magnificent, and I just cant wait next season. <br/><br/>To be clear, I am not trying to pretend that I am movie expert, or critic, and this is my first review ever, but I simply felt that I must share my emotions with whole world.From acting to music, everything is so perfect, that I couldn't understand, why, why this team didn't get Nobel prize for movie chemistry. Not, TV, I am talking about movie chemistry. This is pure art for me. I can not write on English what I feel on Serbian, but those words are common: respect, continue, love. P.S. Now, I have one more wish in my life, to meet acting team from B.B. to pay them personal respect.<br/><br/>Dr. Vet. Med. MILAN A. RAKIC, Belgrade, Serbia. This is my best series that I've ever seen.
It is still number one of my fav film There is nothing bigger and beautiful than this show If you are a real tv series fun than this is must watch. a WOW from the start to the end. MASTERPIECE Yes, this is the story of a Chemistry teacher turned Drug Lord and yes, this is the story that needs no fire breathing dragons, no walking dead people and no nonsense people with nonsense powers to keep you entertained. This series is an Epitome of story writing and screenplay. Extraordinarily plain, simple and enjoyable. 'Breaking Bad' is the best comedy drama that I've seen recently. The plot was very tightly interwoven, the acting was generally great. It used different angles to show different emotions of the characters, which was wonderful.<br/><br/>What I really liked about the drama is that the way how the boring, over-qualified chemistry teacher turn into an evil Heisenburg. He claimed that all he did was for his family, but actually he did it for himself. I was fascinated to see it. The drama dealt with something in human heart really well. I think the only thing that I felt negative about it was the violent scenes.<br/><br/>I recommend 'Breaking bad' to people who think their lives are boring. I came to realise the importance of an ordinary life and I hope other people might feel the same too. After the way so many iconic shows like Lost and The Sopranos (to name just two) get milked dry once they catch fire with the viewing public, I have become reluctant to get sucked into shows once they get popular. Who doesn't hate getting engrossed in great TV series, only to have them go 3-5 seasons longer than they should have and pass a point of diminishing returns, in terms of credible story arc and entertainment value? In other words, don't you feel almost violated when a show jumps the shark but stays on the air?<br/><br/>Such was NOT the case with Breaking Bad. I resisted watching it until they announced the series was concluding at the end of season 5. So, knowing I wouldn't get jerked around for another 5 years, I jumped on the band wagon, binge watched seasons 1-4 and half of season 5 just in time to catch up with real time and finish viewing the series with the rest of the world.<br/><br/>I was stunned and amazed at the originality, consistent world class acting from the entire diverse cast, superb writing, fantastic production values, etc. Literally every aspect of the craft of creating compelling serial television is presented at an unparalleled level.<br/><br/>I rarely watch movies more than once or twice in my life and I have never re-watched 5 years worth of episodes of a single TV series. However, over the holidays at the end of 2016 I binge watched the Breaking Bad series again. It was even better the 2nd time around. At the outset I wasn't sure I would make it all the way through, but there were so many big things I missed the first time, not to mention plenty of fascinating nuances I picked up on the 2nd time through. I found it even more riveting this time. I even went back and watched a few of my favorite episodes a 3rd time during my latest binge. <br/><br/>Breaking Bad hold up well and will for some time. I would have to put it in a tie with The Simpsons as the best TV show of all time. OK, apples and oranges, but both hold a special place in my heart and IMO, rank as great achievements in the pantheon of the history of brilliant television shows.<br/><br/>If you have never watched Breaking Bad I highly recommend you do so. It alone is worth the price of a Netflix subscription. If you have only watched it once, I also recommend you watch it again, and again, perhaps.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad is about as violent and gritty as they come, but if that doesn't dissuade you, this show is not to be missed. It also has moments of hilarity, touching emotional interplay among characters, pathos, conflict, loyalty, betrayal...I could go on, but the list would be exhausting. <br/><br/>By the way, if you aren't a viewer of Better Call Saul, you will doubtless be a fan of this entertaining prequel to Breaking Bad. Better Call Saul can stand on its own, but it is exponentially better if you have watched Breaking Bad. I can't wait for "Saul's" return. I know, I'm breaking my cardinal rule about committing to a show and risking getting drawn into a money driven Frankenstein monster existing just to capitalize on the success of the franchise. But they easily could have milked several more seasons out of Breaking Bad, so I'm throwing caution to the wind and putting my trust in Vince Gilligan and staff to find the sweet spot again. Plus, as a prequel it will eventually merge with the Breaking Bad time-line, so I think the risk is very minimal versus the reward of anticipation that has me drooling for each new episode. If anything, Better Call Saul is more likely to be too short than too long. It has already demonstrated that it is quality TV and like they say, "leave them wanting more." That I can live with. I have just finished watching the entire series. OK I know I'm late to the party, but cognitive dissonance aside - it is a good thing because I don't have to wait for a series to come out when being left on a cliffhanger- and there are plenty of those here. <br/><br/>What Breaking Bad does, isn't quite original or mould breaking in concept. We've seen elements of the story line in any anti hero/gangster rags to riches - and back again, sort of drama in things like Falling Down, Taxi Driver, Scarface and The Sopranos. What BB excels at doing is being consistently exciting in telling it's story and giving us characters to care about.<br/><br/>Walt essentially becomes a sociopath and on this transitional journey as he desperately tries to leave a legacy. I found myself wanting him to succeed at times and wanting him and Jesse to just get on for 5 minutes without having a fight. All of the characters are so well crafted and acted, that towards the end, I also wanted to see Hank succeed to. <br/><br/>Anyway, It's one hell of a journey and shows us humans for what we can easily be, power hungry, manipulative and calculating. No doubt about it, these sorts of things happen/happened in real life - and the gritty realism kept me impressed throughout. It's effortlessly full of humour too, subtle just like life. <br/><br/>Watch it, love it and cherish this work of art. Be thankful for what you have in life - and don't get greedy. Watching two performances that changed the future of television is really a true wonder. Breaking Bad driven by Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul, is some of the best television you will ever be able to find. From sitcoms in the 80's and 90's, to the terribly clichéd soap operas on today, this show is in another league of television. After being diagnosed with cancer, Walter White (Bryan Cranston) runs into an old student of his, and he gains the idea that if they cook and sell methamphetamine, he can make enough money to support his family long after he passes on (while trying to save his own life). I would not recommend this as a great television show, but as a six hour film. Each season seems like an overlong film, with great cinematography, perfect script-writing, and an electric performance by Brayn Cranston. It is arguably the best television show of all time, but I do not like to label. I love "Breaking Bad." Shows come and go. Some suck, others don't. Of course it all comes down to your own opinion - your very own personal preference. Do you like this TV series? What about this one? Or maybe that one? When it comes to Breaking Bad, over the past few years (say, three, maybe four) I genuinely only come across positive talk regarding this very show. The acclaim is high and the ratings are solid. That's nice to know, and good to see. The reason as to why I believe this is a good thing, is because this show is simply fantastic. Irreplaceable? Actually, yeah. It can't be replaced, and not many shows can overtake it. Arguably, it's the greatest show of all time. Not my absolute personal favorite, however it certainly makes my top 5. I think in terms of favoritism, something I don't always note, it's probably my fourth favorite show of all time. But, it might very well be the least flawed and most serious of them all. The writing is unmatchable. I don't know how they did it, but they did it. And they did it damn good. There's some strong writing and character development when it comes to Breaking Bad. Two of the many reasons to give it a viewing.<br/><br/>Critics can think what they want when it comes to movies or TV shows. It's whatever, you know? They're doing what they're doing, so whatever. I know that I, for one, think that this is one of the most amazing things to ever come on TV. And with that being said, this is actually a critics' favorite, not just a fan favorite. So many critics love this show. Critics and fans alike, the show has gained a massive following and if you check sites such as this one, and Metacritic, maybe Rotten Tomatoes, whatever, you will see that this is one of the very highest rated shows out there. I think it might be the highest rated show ever made. Why not, though? It deserves all the love it receives. Breaking Bad was fantastic. Here's a few solid reasons why: 1) The characters. They were likable, man. Not all of them, but loads of them. Your main protagonist (or, as said, I think he's more an, "ant-hero"), Walter White. Sidekick, Jesse Pinkman. Hank. Gus. Mike. Flynn. Crazy-8. Saul. There were tonnes of fantastic characters. Tonnes, man.<br/><br/>2)The writing. Wow, some of the, if not the best writing for any series ever. No wonder why every episode is great to watch. Yeah, every. They're all great. Interesting, enjoyable, they go through many, many things. The topics at hand can be extremely detailed and anticipating. It's brilliant.<br/><br/>3) The chemistry. This is a two-part thing. At first it was a pun, but nah, it stands for two things. The chemistry (topic) like, the science seen in the show - but also, the chemistry between characters, particularly main characters, Walter and Jesse. Firstly, Walter is a genius. He's extremely intelligent, and his chemistry skills are to no limits. He's a very smart man, hence why the show revolves around him and all topics that we see. Secondly, the brotherly-love between Jesse and Walt grows and continuously grows. It's wonderful. It's nice to see and it's one of the best relationships of any show. I love how they work together. It's interesting and it makes the show even better.<br/><br/>4) The actual seasons themselves. As the show progresses, each season just gets better and better than the previous season. Season One, great. Two, fantastic. Three, absolutely amazing. Four, pure genius, masterpiece status. 5, parts I and II, masterpiece status up until its strong, heavy, hard-hitting, face-melter of a conclusion. It. Never. Gets. Boring. It just gets better and better, like I said. And hey, that's a damn good thing, because it keeps you even more interested and evokes the viewer. It's a brilliant thing.<br/><br/>5) Its ending. Since this does include spoilers, I will say. When Walt dies at the end of the series, you may feel sad, but you just know that the last episode, right up until its ending, was fantastic and could not have been done any better. It was pure wonderful and the episodes' writing was terrific. The show had obviously progressed so much by the time it ended so, I won't go in to exact detail regarding the particular villains/antagonists or whatever, but man was the finale incredible. They couldn't have pulled off the second part to Season Five any better than they did, hence why it's like one of the highest rated Seasons of any show. Personally, I like Part I more but the best episode of any of the two parts was either the second last episode of 5 part II, "Ozymandias," or the very last episode itself, "Felina." Those two were really damn good. "Dead Freight," from the first part of Season Five, is also incredibly well-done and well-written.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad was an array of some of the finest, most watchable episodes in history. Coming from someone who has saw hundreds of TV shows, being able to say Breaking Bad makes my top five is quite nice. There was a damn where I was completely and utterly obsessed with the show, and binge watched it not once, but twice. It was great. And although I love all five seasons, my order from favorite to least favorite would be (even though they're all really, really great): 4, 3, 5.1, 5.2, 2, 1. One helluva series. Walter White is one of the greatest characters ever created --- Jesse is fantastic too. Major props to Bryan Cranston. Nobody else could have played Walt. He was perfectly cast. It was definitely the right choice; the only choice. And Aaron Paul was cast perfectly to play Jesse too. As I said, their chemistry (between them) was successful and splendid, and it made the show so good.<br/><br/>10/10. What an awesome change of pace for Bryan Cranston, who is best known for playing the goofy dimwitted Homer Simpson like dad from Malcom In The Middle(2000-2006). But this character is not goofy or dimwitted. Walter White is your everyday man, who is a high school chemistry teacher, and has a loving wife and handicapped son. On the verge of his 50th birthday party. He begins having a mid life crisis, to make matters worse, he is diagnosed with terminal cancer. But not wanting to leave his family with nothing, in a quick way to make a lot of money. He teams up with a former student named Pinkmam(Aaron Paul) who is now a drug dealer, to make the drug called Crystal Meth. You don't like what Walter is doing, but at the same time you try to understand why he is doing it. I like watching the transformation he is going through, like Mr.Chips turning into Michael Douglas from Falling Down(1993). This series is quite enjoyable, it's a good dramatic series, with some humor moments. Cranstons performance in the show is memorable, and at times heartbreaking to watch. And he and Aaron Paul play off each other so well. I hope it will last a little while. http://www.diziklubu.com Realizing nothing I can say here will add to what you already have heard endlessly repeated in exhortations undoubtedly more eloquently phrased than I could ever emulate, please indulge what I consider to be my obligation to share something with you that has impacted my life profoundly. I'm not one to use words lightly, and have always been wary of superlatives. I have enjoyed a rewarding life with a family I love very much. They love me back, I'm convinced, but they can't understand how the fictional universe of Breaking Bad has given me an entirely different view of so many aspects of life. The show changed me in ways I'm still discovering; my thought processes seem to trickle through new filters in ways I sometimes find sublime, other times, abhorrent. Almost never dull. I used to try to explain the hows and whys of this to them, but the blank stares evoke pearls before swine, so why bother? <br/><br/>I'm not blind to the potential mental illness that can be inferred by the thoughts I'm writing about. I just don't care. There's a huge kindred that know my feelings precisely, but that's not who I'm hoping reads this. I'm hoping this post reaches *you*, who has read this far into it. Watch this show. Don't think for a minute that it's not something you'd like because it's about a world you're unfamiliar with. The drugs and violence are just where Vince Gilligan hung his hat to sit and tell you what will be the best story you've ever had the pleasure of hearing. I envy you. If I could erase this show from my memory and watch it with virgin eyes... I would sacrifice quite a bit to be that fortunate. <br/><br/>Game Of Thrones is a ten-star show. Breaking Bad goes to eleven, and then some. Well, What can I say about this amazing TV series? It is just the best series I have ever seen. I miss Walter White and Jesse Pinkman...<br/><br/>The first season is really good, because Walter is worried about his life and what he is going to do after the news about the cancer.<br/><br/>The second and third seasons they keep very good, but I think that the fact of Walter want to forget the idea to cook meth and turn back all the time is a little tiring...<br/><br/>The fourth season is probably the most moment awaited of all the series. Giancarlo Esposito as Gus Fring made a great performance and he really looks like a two-faces man. And you never know what he is going to do. The last episode of fourth season is one of the best, but the fans knew that this amazing series couldn't finish like that.<br/><br/>And then, the amazing, unbelievable, incredible and wonderful fifth season came! I don't have enough words to describe this season. Since the first episode and then after each episode it was getting more tense and I had to watch almost the entire season in one or two days.<br/><br/>Hank was a very nice character and all the audience liked him. The same for Mike and Saul... Great job guys!<br/><br/>The last episode is crazy man... First, I would like to say that the soundtrack chosen was amazing. Baby Blue for who want to check it out.<br/><br/>I think the last scene of that series was perfect and I wouldn't do nothing different. The upshot for Walter and Jesse was worthy.<br/><br/>I watched the documentary about the last season and there was a really good environment. When each character made the last scene, they won a picture with autograph by all the team. Sometimes it was very emotional and Bryan Cranston is the funny guy I ever have seen.<br/><br/>Congratulations and thank you for this series. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul is the best TV series pair. There's honestly too much to talk about when it comes to pointing out the great things about Breaking Bad, but the thing that mainly stood out, for me, were the character relationships. They were so well-defined, and I mean every one of them. You could feel respect between characters, hatred, fear and love. Of course, the one that stands out is Walt and Jesse. Never before has there been such an unpredictable, volatile and constantly shifting relationship in any sort of media. <br/><br/>The actors who portay them add so much to that equation, of course, from Dean Norris to RJ Mitte to the great Jonathan Banks and the stellar Anna Gunn, but there's those two performances that rise above the rest. Aaron Paul is Jesse. The childish tendencies and bitter self-loathing that Paul brings to the character, among other things, is truly impressive. But then there's Bryan Cranston. Dear God. It almost goes without saying, but his is some of the best acting ever. His transformation from hen-pecked nerd to intensely intimidating monster is just awe-inspiring.<br/><br/>One of the best shows to ever grace the small screen, I'm glad I finally caught it and will probably be kicking myself for the next few weeks for putting it off for so long. Breaking Bad (2008–2013) is one of those TV Series in which I loved so much that I had forgotten to write about it. I didn't realize that I hadn't put up a review so over the last week, I watched every episode again and it rocked.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad (2008–2013) is a perfect TV Series filled with a cast that will keep you entertained, and a story that can capture the audience. From season 1-5 the show stayed on point and right with the vibe through and through excluding the last two episodes. The last two episodes of Breaking Bad were probably the weakest of them all, it's as if they were told at the last minute to tidy things up that the show was going to be stopped. My hat goes off to the crew who made the show and how well the quick ending was pulled together, but too many pieces pulling together on closing made it seem rushed. Other than that, top end show; one of our favorites. It's simple. I've never been so hooked up with a series in a my life. Since I watched the first episode in season 1, I couldn't stop watching it. Vince Gilligan did a fantastic work here. The written is a piece of art. The opening theme is sticky. The characters, the script, the actors, the locations, the shots... it's ALL WELL DONE! Every minute, every second is enjoyable. Want to know my truth? today I finished watching all seasons, and I can't imagine my life going on without more seasons of Breaking Bad. I'm sad, because I will miss Mr. White and Mr. Pinkman.<br/><br/>This is the best series in history. ...and for good reason! I am now done with the first season on DVD. If I had to describe this series in a single sentence, It would be: Abbott and Costello spend a "Weekend at Bernie's" in "Fargo". Without Walter's lung cancer and the gruesome crime aspects of the show, it would be totally worth watching as a situation comedy. Let's recap the main family characters: Walter could not be anymore square as the high school chem teacher until he learns of the cancer. Wife Skylar is a continually bewildered bystander...and pregnant. Teenage son Walt Jr. is handicapped (CP?) but for the most part he gets it. Sis-in-law Marie is a kleptomaniac married to Hank, who is some kinda DEA cop. So the prideful Walter must figure out how to pay for his cancer treatment. He is exposed to the idea of big bucks in cooking crystal meth through Hank's drug busts, and hooks up with Jesse, a loser, stoner, small time meth dealer and coincidentally a (bad) former student of Walter. And of course the brilliant chemist Walter is capable of cooking up the best crystal meth to ever hit the streets of Albuquerque, NM, so his talent becomes quickly recognized and valued in the "biz". From there, murder, mayhem and drug deals gone bad ensue and the series takes on the personality of the Coen Brothers' "Fargo". OK, now strap on your seat belt because every minute will either have you aghast in disbelief or rolling on the floor laughing your ass off. Watch it and you will be hooked. Missed the first three episodes thinking why they would use Bryan Cranston from Malcom, but I MADE A HUGE MISTAKE. BEST SHOW EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br/><br/>Home BORED 1 night and AMC ran a marathon of Breaking Bad, so I thought I would check out the three episodes I missed. Ever since then, never missed an episode and been a loyal fan. One of five shows I truly love and will miss. Can not believe ending after season five. The show is truly unique and nothing will ever come close to its originality. Bryan Cranston and everyone involved with the shows deserves the up-most-respect. Will truly miss this show, but a show this great should not be dragged out, because someone or something will ruin it. I'm probably one of the last people on the planet to watch this series. I had heard so many great things about this drama. I watched it as a whole boxed set - borrowed from my brother-in-law. Firstly I will give credit to all the major players in this drama - they put in great performances. So what's disturbing me? The two main characters - Walter and Jesse - the scripts just didn't tie up with the kind of people they were supposed to be. If you are to believe that Walter is generally a mild-mannered, well educated, high-school Chemistry teacher, then the way the story and plots develop, you cannot believe he will turn to murder as easily as he does on occasions. And Jesse is just a useless junkie who occasionally has a conscience. Their characters changed episode to episode just to fit the scripts.<br/><br/>The subject matter bothers me - it kinda normalizes crystal meth production, like they are producing candy bars. The reality of this business is just awful at every level - true, that is shown, but the characters of Walter and Jesse are almost made out to be heroes - and they sure as hell are not. In this line of business, nobody comes out good. It's misery for everyone. Sadly I have personal experience of somebody who's life has been totally ruined for the most part by illegal narcotics and it breaks my heart. He's sitting inside now doing a life sentence - and he's full of regrets and unable to turn back the clock on his life. To see a TV drama like this just doesn't sit comfortably with me.<br/><br/>At the end Jesse appears to get away and doesn't get to answer for his actions. There were many times during the series that you could put a bullet thru the heads of both main characters and feel no compunction or remorse. You would be doing the world a favor! Times have changed with TV dramas, it's not so clear cut as to who are the good guys and who are the bad guys. Shows like Sons Of Anarchy and Mad Men add to this new genre of TV dramas. Sadly there is an element of glorification of the characters which I find repugnant.<br/><br/>The original plot line of Walt providing for his family's future in the event of his death is just not plausible for the actions that he takes.<br/><br/>Despite my misgivings, all the main actors/actresses do a fine job. Some are more believable than others. It saddens me that it appeals to a generation of people to whom crystal meth production and sale is part of everyday life!!! I was a teenager in the late 60's and so I've seen the advancement of illegal narcotics. They have never appealed to me and have never understood why people want to space themselves out so much to not be in total control of their own lives. I'm no prude - believe it or not - I'm no bible basher or right winger. I just live my life with normal ups and downs that we all experience in some form or another and don't feel the need to enhance it, or block it out with narcotics, booze or whatever. Face up to life - good and bad. Narcotics and alcohol will only destroy you.<br/><br/>You can look at this as an analogy of alcohol and gambling - that both of these can be addictive to certain personalities and also have devastating effects, but in these two examples they are legal. I'm prepared to accept that as a valid argument against my comments.<br/><br/>All in all, I felt very saddened by the subject matter and we are now normalizing it on TV by way of anti-heroes. A lot of people will find this either a love it or hate it TV drama - I'm one of the few stuck in the middle. I don't want to see it again. While I was scrolling through the IMDb reviews I found it that there is a lack of reviews that don't worship Breaking Bad. I felt the urge to share my opinion in saying that it isn't as amazing as the whole buzz around it promises. To be fair I binge watched the five seasons in 3 days (I need a life) so maybe my view of the series is different to that of people who waited the weeks for new episodes to air.<br/><br/>The series was really exhausting. The characters turned more evil and their sense of morality degraded as the series continued. This is also a positive point as it shows character development. But the fact that I cared less and less for the characters and therefore for the plot made the series much harder to finish. Only Jesse's breakdown actually got me emotional.<br/><br/>It's also really repetitive. Walt, Jesse and Skyler have a fight. Or someone higher on the crime ladder gets into their business. Eventually it gets fixed at the cost of something.<br/><br/>It was really slow. And I don't mean the episode with the fly! That episode was good. In general the series progresses very slowly. The conversations are also generally uninteresting and boring even when someone is shouting. You have to be quite patient to get through the episode.<br/><br/>But the series is of course not only negatives. It pays close attention to detail and even though it is on the long run quite repetitive, it also has its surprising moments (pizza on the roof anyone?). It isn't as brilliant and perfect as social media shouts but I guess it is one of the better series out there. It has been almost a year since I finished watching Breaking Bad for the first time.There are few incidents in everyone's life which make us thankful to be alive. Watching Breaking Bad was one such incident for me. Be it the absolutely marvellous Bryan Cranston as Walter White, the chemistry between Mr. White and Jesse Pinkman or the impeccable direction in almost every episode, everything was picture perfect. I am sure episodes like Ozymandias, Felina, Dead Freight and Face-off are some of the greatest hours on Television.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad is without a doubt the best thing I have watched on television till date. The quality of Vince Gilligan's creation is as great as the Walter White's crystal meth, completely exhilarating. Cranston became my favourite comedy actor in Malcolm in the Middle, his timing is impeccable and his physicality brought a freshness to his performance. In Breaking Bad he proves that he is not limited in any way to comedy. Supported by a great cast of more than competent actors (with a special mention for Aaron Paul) Cranston is riveting as a terminally ill chemistry teacher who turns to the dark side to provide for his soon-to-be bereaved family.There are elements of comedy in Breaking Bad-very,very black comedy but comedy nonetheless and that too strikes just the right note in the writing and performances. Not one bit of this story would work if any of the writing,direction or acting was wrong. Everything is spot on. The characters are not written or played as stereotypes and the script is tight and drives the story along. The whole enterprise is about as absorbing as drama can be and one cannot wait to see what happens from one episode to the next- and what happens is never predictable. As for the people who throw up their hands in horror and say that a programme like this glorifies drug dealing and drug use, then watch the damn thing!! If ever a programme shows what drugs do to people then BB does. A real cautionary tale.<br/><br/>I am into series 2 now and hope that the standard continues in the third series. A terrific example of what can be done with TV drama when playing it safe is off the agenda. I was really excited about watching this show due numerous recommendations from friends & other people. I had just finished re- watching the whole 6 seasons of the Sopranos for like the 10th time & I was looking for another show to fulfill my hunger for raw television show drama that is founded on intelligent plots & great acting. So I was excited & in an I-cant-wait mood when I pushed that play button as I started watching the first episode of the first season.<br/><br/>But man, if I say I was disappointed that would be an underestimate of my reaction. I could NOT believe that someone in their right mind could recommend this show as an excellent show. And to think that I had actually read somewhere where other people were comparing this show to a great show like the Sopranos, and some even claiming that its a greatest television show ever, it was just saddening.<br/><br/>I mean, there's nothing in this show that makes it a good show. There is NOT one character that's worth watching. I mean Walter tries hard to keep the show going but his whole story is just nothing but some cooked up story that insults any intelligent mind. His wife not only annoys but there is nothing in the show that makes someone be sympathetic with her. And their son, not being disrespectful to the disabled, is so annoying & it appears his appearance in the show is nothing but a plot by the writers of the show to get some sympathy for this family from the audience. And don't get me started on the Jessie Pinkman character. He is the whole reason why after watching a few episodes of the second season I completely gave up on the show.<br/><br/>I don't recommend this show to anyone with sense. I am so surprised with the awards & the positive reviews its getting. And I know its not me, because I know the difference between good & bad writing, acting & production. So yeah like I said, I don't care what anybody says, this show sucks big time. my husband and I never watched the show before, but I had an injury that left me out of work for a few weeks and my husband took some time off from his job, we spent 3 days binge watching season 1- season 5 pt1 of breaking bad. I love godfather 1&2, tony Montana is a fave character of mine, I've seen goodfellas more than I can count, and I recently saw "the family" in the theater and was very impressed.<br/><br/>so, at least now you all know what kind of entertainment I like. black comedies, drug shoot out, mobster movies. <br/><br/>anyways... we started off with season 1. it was a little slow moving at first, and I don't think I would have given it much of a chance if it weren't for all the hype. Bryan Cranston (Walter White)embodied Walt very well, I truly felt sorry for the poor guy, even though many times throughout the series I felt as if I was watching a darker version of Hal from Malcolm in the Middle (set included). Skylar white was a forgettable character, leaving only a slight impression of an overbearing nit picking nag of a wife to an already beaten down Walt. Hank the hapless DEA bro-in-law came across as the big talk small brained idiot threat borderline bully to Walt. and then there was Aaron Paul playing Jessie Pinkman. a burnout former student making every possible wrong decision and inadvertently thwarting disaster.<br/><br/>the first couple of seasons I felt pity for the two main characters Walt and Jessie, I was rooting for them to not get caught, be able to turn a profit, or to come out unscathed. it wasn't a gut wrenching plot twisting season, just more of witnessing a journey for these two guys. <br/><br/>Jessie seemed consistent, who ever wrote him did a good job, not only was he consistent as a junkie, big hearted idiot, but watching his character from start to almost finish was a joy, he progressed, his morals enhanced, he became more cautious more stoic he often did the right thing and knew when to call it quits. there was a defining character arch for Jessie. if any part of the show was worth viewing it was the storyline of Jessie Pinkman (as bland as it sometimes seemed, at least I wasn't disgusted in the character's actions/reactions)<br/><br/>then there was Skylar White, the character of her progressed from a nagging housewife to a cold shouldered biatch sometimes I couldn't tell which was worst Walt or Skylar, her character was not very well written, she was supposed to be a smart woman, but all she came across as was a "do as I say not as I do" brat. helping her boss cook the books of his tax evasion but criticizing her husband for cooking meth to provide for his family. Having her ex-boss bullied to pay his taxes and thus keeping IRS eyes off her money laundering business, but judging Walt for taking out a crime boss who not only threatened to kill her brother in law, but also was a threat to her life and her children's lives. Then sleeping with her boss and pushing Walt out of the house and banning him from their kids. but when Walt started racking in the money while working for Gus then she was happy. it seemed like her character never really arched into anything but an annoying spoiled brat who was appeased only by money. <br/><br/>and last there was Walt. I really was rooting for the guy, but he was an impulsive egotistical sociopath who never spoke up when he should have and never shut up when he needed to. by the end of watching the show, I just felt that Walt was little more than a self absorbed whiny man who would sob and wet himself if faced with a real threat of dying. (even though he had been faced with death earlier in the series) he wasn't the "badass" the hype of the show had lead me to believe that he was. <br/><br/>I think the turning point for me was when he got jealous that Pinkman was getting more love from Gus than him, so his natural inclination was to take out Gus, (which was awesome BTW) but before killing Gus, Walt was taken out to the desert to get fired by Gus, Gus gave him a threat, but in no way up to this point was it clear that Gus would have gone back on his word and killed Walt or Walt's family. however Walt went off the deep end (like he always does, he thinks of the worst possible scenario and fixates on that until his actions change the course) in other words most of the incidents throughout the series could have been avoided with 2 things: 1. communication, and 2. Walt not overeating <br/><br/>all in all I feel horrible I wasted a few days watching this over hyped series. the writing is inconsistent, plots and scenarios change drastically in an unrealistic way, but then with the exception of a few most of the characters never seemed to arch, never seemed to expand. I would have stopped watching if it weren't for the fact that my husband had control over the remote! I really couldn't wait for this to end, I felt it just dragged on & on forever, I felt I had been watching it for 20 years by the time it finally finished.<br/><br/>It started of OK, a black comedy but then it just got more and more serious and more and more nastier with more and more annoying accents and characters with each episode, music became less and less as episode one started with some good tunes. Constantly hearing Jesse scream yo, bitch, was making my head feel like it wanted to explode.<br/><br/>Really I found it all a bit daft, going round and round in circles and about 2 episodes too long. Maybe it's a cultural thing but it really didn't do a great deal for me though it was good in places, Walt played his part well turning from a nice man into a total back stabbing pos by the end.<br/><br/>Both my Mrs and I were relieved when it came to end, it was OK, but not as great as the hype suggest. The main message, crime doesn't pay unless your a politician. This isn't the worst I have seen but I just couldn't help myself by dropping my two cents. Overall, I think this show is OK, but why such high praises and great reviews? I find the show quite slow and boring, there are so many other shows that are much more interesting than this, are these reviewers on IMDb paid? Really don't get it, this show sucks. Have I been watching a different show than you guys? How can such a boring show be liked by all these reviewers? Please stop watching it, it really does suck, nothing in the show is exciting, it put me to sleep more than once, I even find it difficult to complaint about it using a minimum of ten lines which is required before I can post this. I decided to stop watching it in the middle of third season because I cannot stand it anymore and I can care less about what happens next.<br/><br/>A few weeks ago, I was looking for a good TV series through Netfix and saw "Breaking Bad" title. I heard about it previously and it had a great rating as well as on IMDb, so I gave a shot.<br/><br/>Wow, are you kidding me! This series is like an American version of those Korean or Taiwanese screaming, tearing, slow-paced TV drama shows. Don't get me wrong. Those kind of shows are extremely popular in Asia and my mother loves them except me. I agree that everyone has standards when it comes to show and film; however, this as the best in America where Hollywood resides... NO. Well, comparing to others, it could be the best and that's why I gave it one star rather than none.<br/><br/>"Slow-pacing" is perceived differently. I don't consider "Tree of Life" as slow-paced and I think it is one of the most inspirational movies ever made. "Tree of Life" conveys ideas with a flow of images more often than words. Through images and occasional dialogue and narratives, it leaves bread crumbs for audience to find the clues. I thought it was brilliant and the way, it showed me, intrigued me and carried me emotionally to the end.<br/><br/>Now, about "Breaking Bad," it is very slow-paced because it showed me everything and that wasn't enough, it also told me everything. I got bored in the middle of first season but I really tried to like the series so I continued. I even started to draw (my past time hobby) while "watching" the episodes because I didn't really have to watch it anymore. Just by hearing it, I could learn everything about the story.<br/><br/>The WORST was all the screaming, yelling, arguing and tearing. Well, that wasn't as severe as Korean/Taiwanese drama shows, but it was just too much for me. I guess that is why it is so popular ... I mean look at all the reality shows. Doesn't the audience love reality TV people yelling at each other in TV? 9.5/10 on IMDb ... well, Iron Man 3 has 7.4/10 and tree of life as 6.7/10. This tells me everything and so sad ... so sad. Definitely one of the all time best. Pitch-perfect story-telling with pitch-perfect acting. Not every episode is a masterpiece, but enough are to make the series a stunning television achievement and a must watch for anyone looking for quality programming. As the series explores the ups and downs of Bryan Cranston's everyman, and as circumstances force the everyman to spiral in and out of control, the viewer is caught up in the often compassionate and touching, and often horrifying and gut-wrenching situations and decisions he haphazardly or possibly in a state of panic, makes for a decidedly misguided (but wholly understandable) purpose. The love, the hate, the forgiveness, the revenge, the humor, the sadness, the loyalty, the betrayal, the goodness, and the evil, it's all there, and it's done to perfection. Watch this man make the ultimate sacrifice for what may or may not be the ultimate reason (and was it really worth it). Fortunately for the rest of us, this journey was totally worth it. This is a very popular series, but it's not due to it's writing. It's due to the 12A certificate.<br/><br/>Loose ends loose ends everywhere. This isn't like Game of Thrones, where all the loose ends are tied up by the end of the episode. Nor does the next one pick up where the last episode left off. It's extremely frustrating.<br/><br/>Another aspect that is eye-rolling is just how incompetent these two nit wits are. Very rarely do you end up routing for these annoying characters, & even more rare is how often they triumph. This is probably what Americans like to witness.. people who make them feel superior by comparison - struggling, suffering, & loosing for their enjoyment.<br/><br/>God knows how no one would notice large amounts of cash being deposited in an account frequently used to pay for chemotherapy.<br/><br/>All these characters are conveniently bad in one way or another, & without a shred of honour or principles beyond their own egos. These are some of the most shallow characters, & you get cliché contretemps over & over again.<br/><br/>The premise is original for sure, which is such a same, because everything else has been butchered by the network & studios. It's done in such a strict American sitcom fashion that all class & taste is absent.<br/><br/>How this has the same score as GOT I do not know. The show focuses on Walter White a guy who could afford a much nicer car than the one he drives. He could afford this because he's a successful drug manufacturer. At first he begins this dangerous career to make money to pay for cancer treatment. However somewhere along the way the writers began to lean away from the whole cancer issue. It seems to have disappeared as cases of terminal cancer so often do in reality. Along with the less than desirable vehicle Walt drives is his less than desirable harlot of a wife Skylar. This dried out old box has brought Walter down from one high after another during the course of this unfortunate program. Walt's one friend seems to be a meth addled degenerate wigger named Jesse. In short we have the tale of a guy with way too much money to have such a whore of a wife and a retarded best friend. Bob Odenkirk is awesome in this. I decided to watch this after hearing how good it was - I hadn't watched any of it by the time the last episode had aired.<br/><br/>After watching the pilot I thought that the show had potential and was looking forward to getting into a new show - (having just finished Dexter and whilst The Walking Dead and Game of Thrones were both on a break).<br/><br/>The short first season spent its time building us up for nothing to actually happen. But as it was quite short and all I had heard was how amazing this show is I opened up Season 2. This was very much of the same - every episode building up to something but not much actually happening.<br/><br/>Admittedly Season 3 was a bit better but still quite boring in comparison to many people telling me it's the best TV show ever. In all honesty I haven't bothered with the last 2 seasons as I feel that I have lost several hours of my life watching the first 3 and it's not worth putting the effort in watching the rest. There are plenty of TV shows worth watching before this one. I cannot honestly see why this program has high reviews. I made it to Episode 6 of season 2.<br/><br/>I am finished now...<br/><br/>As the title says, this is a horrible show full of horrible people, I simply could not connect with any of them, it bums me out after every episode and has no redeeming qualities whatsoever, episode 6 of season 2 (Peekaboo) finished me off, I am not prepared to watch things like that if there is no balance (at least there is no balance for me, some people may find the "lighter" moments good, but I didn't) The show is just constantly depressing.<br/><br/>The acting is "ok" at best, the jokes are not really funny, the drama is annoying and has a "seen it all before" feel to it, and all the characters are selfish, miserable, stupid ar$e-holes.<br/><br/>People say this is the best show of all time, hmmm, I don't think so, this is not even in the same league as The Sopranos, and is certainly not as good as: Walking dead, Dexter, Game of Thrones, Mad Men and a few others I could name.<br/><br/>I give it 3 stars because there were one or two moments of decent comedy, and the occasional bit of good writing, but how this stinking turd comprised of human misery rates so high generally is beyond me. SOOOOOOO boring. so f*cking boring. and its not just the gritty depressing cinema verite thing. everyone quotes it like its so badass or something "i am the one who knocks!" like seriously? 6 seasons and thats the best quotable line? I did think that scene where the dude dies by the pond or the other dude got half his face blown off was pretty cool but daredevil had WAYYY more badass moments in its first season than breaking bad had in its entire series. (the hallway scene and the car door scene alone top that) I only watched it all the way through because i expected based off of what everyone said that at some point this yawn fest would actually get good. It didn't. One of the few scenes i enjoyed was the one in the finale where Jesse is crying tears of joy tearing away from the compound, because thats exactly how i felt finally being done with this god-awful series.<br/><br/>Lets start with the fact that everything is just painfully slow paced. It always starts with an establishing shot of some insignificant detail that is later revealed to the viewer, yeah that gimmick was cute the first time but the fact that you have to do it EVERY. SINGLE. EPISODE. It just shows how lazy and gratuitous you are with faux- profundity and wannabe art-house bullsh*t. Trying to be all Gaspar Noe with it but you really end up like granny at the family reunion with a camcorder. I feel like stewie from family guy, "every hot girl with a camera thinks she's a photographer, ooh, you took a black and white picture of a lawn chair and its shadow and developed it at save-on, you must be so brooding and deep." Thats exactly the impression i get from this show. Its poorly shot, generally hand-held instead of jib, the colors all washed out like they shot it on a hi-8 back in the 90s, and i get that its an artistic choice, but its a completely superficial artistic choice that combined with the droll acting, minimal action, and just general lack of any compelling anything provides a general air of a show that is trying immensely hard to give the appearance of a thoughtful reflection on the somewhat misanthropic nature of good and evil and humanity, but in fact, is just sincerely full of itself. <br/><br/>Walter White cooks meth. Walter white makes a deal with a drug dealer. it goes south and he has to kill him. Walter White makes a deal with his boss. it goes south and he has to kill him. Walter White makes a deal with his bosses boss. it goes south and he has to kill him. all of this could have taken place within a single season, without all this unnecessary talk about veggie bacon and star trek and speaker systems, its like they were trying so hard to capture dialog that wasn't clichéd or hadn't been done before, that instead they just literally picked the most boring parts of the human experience and captured it on tape. I spent 6 seasons thinking to myself, i don't give a f*ck about any of these characters. Why should i give a f*ck about any of these characters? Which one am i supposed to be rooting for? Emotionally invested in? Its trying to be like that whole pulp fiction royale with cheese thing where people are just gabbing about something unrelated but the reason that scene was so effective was because it was juxtaposed against what they were there in that car to do. But this whole show, even the spin off, it literally took them 20 minutes to do a scene to illustrate, Saul can't sleep. Kim just woke up. Saul left a voice mail with a off key song on it. 20 f*cking minutes. SO. BORING. None of this is important, or vital to the plot, or interesting, or relevant, or, as it tries so desperately hard to be, an exploration of the human condition. And i get the need to not be some pulp action film that is just filled with gratuitous violence and explosions, but i'd rather that than gratuitous boredom and obnoxiousness. If not a show that is primarily kinetic and physical, then at least provide a PSYCHOLOGICAL, cerebral experience that doesn't feel like scraping a cheese grater across my forehead. To provide for his family (pregnant wife Anna Gunn and teenager son RJ Mitte)'s future after he is diagnosed with lung cancer, a chemistry genius called Wlter (Bryan Cranston) turned high school teacher teams up with an ex-student named Jesse to cook and sell the world's purest crystal methamphetamine proves to be remarkably proficient in this new world as he begins manufacturing and selling Methamphetamine with one of his former students . Though his talent for chemistry appears to be wasted at the high school level , Walter does seems to enjoy bringing science to young minds . He join forces with Jesse (Aaron Paul), a former student of Walter White's at High School , he is now a producer and occasional user of Meth, known in the area as "Cap'n Cook." This affinity for teaching and respect themselves can be seen in the relationship between Walter and Jesse . As Walter thrust into a partnership with an irresponsible, burn-out criminal . The Meth makes them very rich very quickly, but it attracts the attention of his DEA brother in law , Hank (Dean Norris) , who is always hot on his tail.<br/><br/>A main plot point of Breaking Bad concerns the main character, Walt, being a bona fide chemistry genius being accompanied by Aaaron Paul as Jesse who is the classic underachiever , he clearly possesses talents, but is lacking dramatically when it comes to common sense and follow-through . Amusing as well entertaining relationship between Walter/Bryan Cranston and Jesse/Aaron Paul, this paves the way for a classic Odd Couple dynamic as the conservative middle-aged teacher . Very good acting by all cast such as Walter , a mature chemistry teacher at Wynne High School in Albuquerque, New Mexico , he is diagnosed with lung cancer and given approximately two years to live , Aaron Paul as Jesse , he grew up in a somewhat privileged home, the oldest child of an upper middle class Albuquerque family, Jesse was ultimately kicked out of his home due to repeated drug use ; Anna Gunn as Skyler , she is no shrinking violet , she is fiercely protective of her children will do whatever she can to keep them shielded from dangerous influences , she is a patient woman, but that patience will become tested as Walter descends deeper in the seedy world of the meth trade and Dean Norris as an agent with the Drug Enforcement Agency in Albuquerque , he is married to Skyler White's sister, Marie, finely performed by Betsy Brendt , he has a somewhat stereotypical personality for an officer of the law, a gruff, mans man who is cynical about criminals and has aspirations to climb the ladder in the DEA, perhaps moving to a larger department or to headquarters in Washington. Other import characters of this series are the followings : Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman . Steven Michael Quezada as Steven Gomez , Jonathan Banks as Mike Ehrmantraut and Giancarlo Esposito as Gustavo 'Gus' Fring . Sony and AMC were initially reluctant to cast Bryan Cranston because of his previous comedic roles and considered both John Cusack and Matthew Broderick for Walter White. When they both declined, Vince Gilligan got to cast Cranston. But for the writers' strike in the first season, Aaron Paul's Jesse Pinkman would have been written out by the 9th episode. During the hiatus caused by the strike, creator Vince Gilligan reconsidered and, impressed by Paul's portrayal of Jesse, decided to reinstate the character. .The actor who portrays Walter Jr. in the series (RJ Mitte), actually has cerebral palsy like his character on the show. However, his real life affliction is much milder than his character's, and he had to learn to walk with crutches and slow down his speech to play the part. This is still easily the best show I have ever seen. Better call Saul was good, but not the same.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad blows Game of Thrones out of the water. It finished perfectly. The entire series is great. Plenty of rewatch value.<br/><br/>The cinematography is great.<br/><br/>Directing is great. Show is very suspenseful. Cliffhangers are relevant and deserving. <br/><br/>Show has a unique feel to it. Quite spacey.<br/><br/>Take it as it is and you will enjoy.<br/><br/>A masterpiece.<br/><br/>10/10 I initially passed on Breaking Bad thinking it was the typical Hollywood glorification of bad behavior & drug dealing. I truly was prejudice because of the title name(Breaking Bad) and the current garbage that was on TV. Well anyway, the final episode and conclusion made the rounds on cable news discussions and I was curious how it ended. I knew the basic plot, a chemistry teacher is diagnosed with terminal cancer and decides to break bad with a former student to sell drugs in order to leave his family with some money. By chance I watched the final episode and I was immediately impressed with the quality and cinematography, as well as the overall texture of the show. I then watched the final season on a cable TV binge and was hooked. I then watched the show from beginning to end several times since.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad is the best show ever. The show stays with you. For the next 10 years people will be discussing what made it so good. So much has already been said about the show but I will like to add my 2 cents. What made the show so enjoyable for me was the analysis of the characters and what made them do what they did. As a viewer, I felt a responsibility to analyze the characters in a way I've never did before. I was challenged to see deeper into these TV show characters like I have never previously did while watching a TV show. The characters are complex and aren't for the stupid. This show is truly unprecedented in my opinion. I would only compare Breaking Bad to The Beatles music catalog, that is it's consistent quality that constantly changes and provides great entertainment for the viewer. Truly Breaking Bad is a masterpiece for the ages. Breaking Bad is an immensely powerful show which is terrifically written, very well acted and creative in so many ways. The show is also well grounded and doesn't seem over exaggerated (something which could actually happen). The majority of the characters are interesting and so you can connect with them in many ways, the character arcs from the 'Pilot' to 'Felina' is truly astonishing. I for one have watched the series twice, the first concentrating on the characters and storyline and the second looking out for the beautiful pieces of foreshadowing and symbolism and also wondering why a character has chosen to do something. The cinematography and amount of thought and effort that has gone into each episode is just extraordinary. However BB can suffer from pacing issues particularly in between season 2-3 (literally the only negative).<br/><br/>Many people will point out that the first season is slow but I found it to be a great introduction to the main characters and prepared you for future events. We get an introduction to Walter in the infamous RV a clever technique is used here (and in future episodes) which gives the audience a clichéd moment of "what happens next?" By the second episode Walter has killed a man. An extremely hard decision to make from an innocent person. By the last episode of this season we have established that Tuco is a major threat to our 'heroes' Walt and Jesse. But Walt begins to exhibit his own dark side when he introduces 'Heisenberg' and so from this point on there is no turning back because of the sacrifices and choices he has made for his family.<br/><br/>Season 2 focuses on the other main character Jesse Pinkman and how a young trouble maker deals with the illegal meth making business. Due to Jesse being a 'lone ranger' so to speak it seems that he can hind his criminal activities better than Walt. But we realize Jesse is an emotional character in comparison to how heartless Walt can be. The death of Jane is a perfect example of these two parallels.<br/><br/>Season 3 is slightly better than 2 as Walt and Jesse delve deeper into the meth world, and this affects those around them. Skyler must deal with the fact her husband is a criminal and doesn't understand why. The end of this season is one I favor over anything in seasons 1 and 2. 'Half and Full measure' are superb episodes because of how much Walt is willing to sacrifice to climb the business ladder and to show Mike and Gus what he's capable of. He means business and disposing of him is far from easy. Walt is toxic a Gus Fring in his own right, unpredictable and always ahead of the game.<br/><br/>Season 4 just goes to show how the series continues to surprise us in many ways. From the first episode we still know Gus is at the top and Walt and Jesse are mere workers in a big operation. However Walt's ego continues to expand much like his cancer did/will and continues to find new and inventive ways to get his way. In 'Face off' (my personal favourite) Walt disposes of his boss and enemy in the best death of any TV show ever! Props to the special effects and makeup too. Now Heisenberg is truly the "one who knocks" and the meth kingpin.<br/><br/>Season 5- Now that Fring is dead and no longer an issue Walt takes his place over Mike and Jesse. Walt feels at the top and he really is but he's completely lost touch with Skyler and the rest of his family and so things are just going to get worse. Jesse begins to see Walter as he really is (thanks to Mike) and they decide to leave the business. Walt despises this idea and his anger gets the better of him, killing Mike in the process. Believing it had to be done he shrugs it off and hinds it from Jesse; he becomes ever more suspicious. 'Gliding over all' sets up the final season perfectly as Hank discovers that Walt is Heisenberg. Tensions have risen yet again! I get goosebumps whenever I watch this scene! When the truth is out in the final season s**t has hit the fan and everyone is at breaking point. Walt appears weak in the middle of this season, desperately hiding and protecting/disposing of anything Hank can use to convict him. The complete breakdown and effects of Walt's actions have created all of this- disconnection of family and friends, the deaths of hundreds of innocent people and the scars he's left on those affected. Walt's demise is sad but should be satisfying. He convinced himself it was for his family but in the end he admitted it was for himself- he felt 'ALIVE'. It just goes to show even the nicest people are capable of doing horrific things if they convince themselves its for the greater good. He can't justify what he's done but can try and set things right and finally see himself for what he has become and understand that 'Heisenberg' was under his skin the whole time he just needed something to set him free. A life altering thing that made him see the world in a different light and knew he had to change to adjust to this situation even if it was morally wrong, Walt was Heisenberg and he was alive....<br/><br/>Its easy to see how I believe this is and always will be the greatest TV show ever, its original story, amazing moments, characters and everything else are simply unmatched. I'm so glad BB received many awards- it fully deserves them all. It is a work of Art, the highest point Television is going to reach and that is the truth. Breaking Bad is a masterpiece. Breaking Bad is not only the best show ever produced, it is also the only show that gets better and better with each season. The in-depth characterization, the superb acting, the witty lines, the beautiful cinematography and the captivating plot are the reasons this show is still rated #1 of all time by critics. I am happy I got to watch BB live on TV and I'm envious of those who will get to watch the show for the first time. It's so good that I was going through withdrawals after the series ended. I tried watching other shows such as The Wire, True Detective, Boardwalk Empire, The Sopranos, Deadwood, House of Cards, Lost and Prison Break, but none kept my interest the way Breaking Bad did. Even Game of Thrones, my second favorite show, couldn't compare to the consistency, thoroughness and shock factor of BB. Kudos to everyone who made this show possible for us movie addicts! The story is captivating and the series has very interesting and unforgettable characters like Walt, Hank, "Better Call Saul" Goodman, Hector Salamanca etc. Unfortunately after season 3 there are serious dramatic incredibilities, the most important is when Jesse disappears from Walt's house, after making everything soaked in gasoline, his car open, and Walt does not suspect that somebody took him. It is so incredible and does not follow previous storyline and inside logic of the character. After this you cannot believe in the future episodes. Other thing is that Walt uses the same mobile after knowing that he is investigated, who can believe this? Even a toddler knows not to use your mobile for discussing important issues. What a pity. It could have been one of the best series, but because of these inconsistencies, it is not. Forty-two years ago the blessed Godfather hit our screens and from the generation that first viewed it, they have passed it down to their children as a must-see film, and after forty-two years the film still retains its ringing influence on the entertainment industry to the point it has and will continue to be viewed and studied from all areas of the world.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad, in my humble opinion, has the same ringing influence. I believe in forty-two years time and beyond this show will be passed down as the greatest piece of television ever created. Unfortunately we won't realise it yet as, just as the first generation that watched the godfather in 1972 didn't quite realise how much of an influence the film would have, the same can be said here as we are the first generation to view the excellence that is 'Breaking Bad'.<br/><br/>This is not a review per say but my way of expressing my gratitude to the show. I know it can be stupid to become too obsessed with film and TV to the point people say your not living in reality. But if we think about it, could it be that the influence of television and its ability to play with our emotions and thoughts just prove its shows more realism in our lives than we previously considered. This is what 'Breaking Bad' does so superbly, with Vince Gillingam trying to show how even the kindest of people can be the ones who are hiding their true hidden selves in the shadows.<br/><br/>The ability of this show that it makes you reflect months after about express the magnitude of influence it has. I for one have heard people describe it as the 'Greatest TV Show of all time' but here I disagree. <br/><br/>As this show is more than that, it honestly should be considered as one of the 'Greatest pieces of Art'. I wont tell you how or why but they only way you as a reader can find out is to pick up the remote and watch it - at first you may see it as just a normal TV show but I urge you to find the deeper connection it has to the viewer. The teachings on morality, family dedication, choices and loyalty. We live by these morals every day and the show helps us reflect on our actions and how we choose to live our life. <br/><br/>I know this is sounding really deep and I have no doubt I will be seen as a sap with someone thinking 'what a load of crap that guys talking about' and to you I say you're probably right. As what I'm saying probably hasn't made much sense and even when you watch the show it may not do either but maybe just maybe in 42 years time, you may be struck by the realisation of the artistic message this show had. <br/><br/>Prehaps my review can be contradicted by the show itself in Season 2's episode 'Better Call Saul'...<br/><br/><ul><li>Saul Goodman: 'What did Tom Hagen do for Vito Corleone?'</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Walter H. White: 'I'm no Vito Corleone'</li></ul><br/><br/>But the truth of that statement is up for you to debate upon. Just grab a drink and the remote! The outline is clear. Most people will know what it is about even those who haven't seen the show. The teacher who decides to take a step into darkness. And the consequences, he and others have to suffer because of that. Bryan Cranston is superb in his portrayal of Walter White the chemistry teacher, who after being diagnosed with cancer, decides to take matters in his own hands.<br/><br/>Having met an old pupil of his, Jesse Pinkman played by Aaron Paul, both undergo a journey, that has its up and downs. But while Walter White has his family (and all the relationships feel realistic), there is a special bond that is hard to explain, between Mr. White and Pinkman. Trying to depict every little great aspect of the show would take too long. The show itself though does take its time, building up tension and when it gets released, it is heavy! Be it because of the action involved or the emotional impact.<br/><br/>The first season may seem to have a very slow pace, but even so it has more than its fair share of great moments (I'll only mention the bathtub, which had me almost crying because of laughter). Season 2 picks up and there is almost no stopping after that. There are McGuffins here and there (like the eye of a teddy bear to name but one) and they all enhance the feeling that this show is real. Feels real that is. The show is obviously for mature audiences, because of its content. Which is the violence and the behavior of characters, not any nudity! Over December 2013 and January 2014, I decided to embark with my parents on a marathon to watch Breaking Bad. Now that I've finished the marathon, I can proudly say, as my summary does, the best television show to ever air on television (and I don't think I'm alone in my opinion)<br/><br/>When I first heard about this show, all I heard were just raving reviews and nothing bad to say. With that in mind, I started on Season 1, and I was immediately addicted (I actually could not stop watching)<br/><br/>Now, what makes Breaking Bad the best show ever? Here are 10 reasons why;<br/><br/>1. The way in which the story is unravelled is just pitch-perfect. I guess a story is when a series of events occur one after the other. Breaking Bad marries each scene and each episode to perfection, and in doing so, makes each episode better than the last one.<br/><br/>2. There is a very intelligent mix of both drama and black comedy. This doesn't just apply over the course of one episode; this applies throughout entire seasons.<br/><br/>3. The characters in the show are very strong and creates empathy amongst the audience. For example, you really feel for Jesse when he is distraught over Jane's death. Conversely, Walter starts off as a sympathetic character down on his luck, but by Season 5 Part II, you really hate him the same way you would a villain.<br/><br/>4. The acting on this show, especially that of Bryan Cranston's, is just phenomenal. Every single actor manages to make their character believable and not fumble up their lines. Special mentions also go out to Aaron Paul, Dean Norris, Giancarlo Esposito and RJ Mitte.<br/><br/>5. Unlike most shows (especially The Wire), the dialogue in Breaking Bad is very concise and tight. It doesn't drag on and include gratuitous lines.<br/><br/>6. The cinematography is so exquisite, that it's fair to say each frame is like a painting. As a cinematographer, the use of manual focusing and closeups is stellar. I'd also like to point out the extensive use of POV shots and time lapses.<br/><br/>7. The choices of music throughout the show are very sophisticated and varied. For example, the end of Season 1 features Gnarls Barkley's song Who's Gonna Save My Soul as Walt embraces his identity of Heisenberg, while in Season 5 Part I, Duke Ellington's Overture is used as Dan fills the safety deposit boxes. However, the most memorable choice of music is the series finale, with Badfinger's Baby Blue.<br/><br/>8. The use of sound helps to dive into the psyche of characters. For example, in the pilot, when Walt is worried about his cancer, the words of his doctor are faint, and at the end of Season 1, when Tuco beats up No Doze, you hear the sounds of Tuco's knuckles pounding No Doze's flesh.<br/><br/>9. The damaging effects of drugs are portrayed in a very realistic manner. A perfect example of this is when Jesse and Jane have shot up heroin, and Jane is moved out of her recovery position and asphyxiates on her vomit.<br/><br/>10. No other show in history has as much critical acclaim as Breaking Bad does. For example, it is the #1 show on IMDb, with a score of 95, on Metacritic, it holds a score of 99, and on Rotten Tomatoes, is holds a perfect score of 100.<br/><br/>Overall, I would highly recommend this show to just about anyone who enjoys quality entertainment. If you plan to watch it, DO NOT WAIT FOR PERMISSION. GO WATCH IT IMMEDIATELY. Bryan Cranston...man hats-off to you for your extraordinary acting!!...This is the best comedy-thriller drama you will ever see in decades..The choice of the character is awesome and the plot of this show is simply astonishing.Just watch the pilot and then you are hooked.This is one of those best shows that you can definitely count on.This show has every aspect of entertaining you.If you want a start any TV series just start it with Breaking Bad ..This show has got some real talent and some real acting with a powerful and substantial story.This is simply a Masterpiece created by Vince Gilligan.<br/><br/>A MASTERPIECE you don't wanna miss !!!! Of course I didn't find out about this show until the series was concluded. Breaking Bad is an up in the now American crime drama television series produced and created by Vince Gilligan. The setting of Breaking Bad is Albuquerque New Mexico. It is about a high school chem teacher who is terminally ill with lung cancer. At this diagnosis Walter White (Bryan Cranston) turns about face to a life of violent crime, and turns to the drug trade, manufacturing and selling high quality methamphetamine with former student, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul).<br/><br/>Top series writers are Vince Gilligan, Peter Gould, George Mastras, Sam Catlin and Moira Walley-Beckett. Breaking Bad has won ten prime-time Emmy awards and Cranston took three wins consecutively for Best Actor.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad was one of the America's top leading TV shows and portrays violence, crime and intrigue. If you want to sit down for a good pique of your interest, then this series is the place to be.<br/><br/>But it's more than just great entertainment, Breaking Bad transcends typical crime dramas. Walter White has been the underdog his whole life. He's been taken advantage of and had bad luck at every turn. He's never achieved his dreams, never done anything courageous. And now he has a short time to live. He's always been a clean cut, honourable man. Until now. He's dying. He wants to make money to support his family. Most of all, he wants to make up for the time he feels he wasted. This drives him to do things that would make you hate any other man, but not Walter - no, you'll root for him to win.<br/><br/>This is the greatest TV show ever made, and every other show will have to sit at the kids table. There is only one other show that could come close to rivaling Breaking Bad and that was The X- Files. I own all 9 seasons of The X-Files on DVD, and now Breaking Bad has taken 1st place on my list of Television Show Must Owns.<br/><br/>I'm not one to watch TV series year after year, but Vince Gilligan and crew created one heck of a masterpiece.<br/><br/>This wasn't a show which glorified drug use and crime (as I've had to explain to many who never cared enough to watch prior to making comments); it was a show about the human condition and what happens when ordinary people are placed within extraordinary situations.<br/><br/>What would you do, and how would you do it? <br/><br/>The concept of morality, good versus evil, black and white, or is morality only shades of gray... I've never seen any show deal with these concepts better than Breaking Bad.<br/><br/>Every single Emmy the show and cast received was very well earned. The ONLY thing that disappoints me about this show is that I can't watch it again for the first time, so I am truly envious of anyone who hasn't seen it. The excitement that washes over you when watching this show for the first time is hard to describe. It is just amazing in every way, the filming, the scenes, the music, the storyline and of course the acting was AMAZING! And not just 1 actor in particular, I mean of course Bryan Cranston was superb, and Aaron Paul alike but ALL of the actors were great and they all made you love them in a different way. There is not a single minute of this show wasted with pointless storyline. Every single minute of all the 62 episodes keeps you entranced and wanting more. Even the slow areas have a significant story to tell and these moments are usually related to something that will happen later in the show. This is by far the best series I have EVER seen, if you haven't seen it please give it a chance, but be prepared to do nothing but watch breaking bad for the next 3 weeks because you literally won't be able to do anything else. Without a doubt, Breaking Bad is the best show ever created. Right from the pilot episode, this show had me engaged from start to finish. Every episode had meaning, emotion and humor, and there was not one episode that I felt was bad.<br/><br/>What makes breaking bad is the characters and the originality of the plot. The acting is magnificent. Even from the most minor character you can think of. The plot is outstanding and without the style, color and writing from the brilliant mind Vince Gilligan, the plot would not have worked. Vince was made to make this movie as the entire cast and crew were. The style of the show is so unique. Almost like a Tarantino film. The characters and writing are definitely something like a Tarantino film.<br/><br/>Season 1 starts off nice and easy with some slow paced moments, setting up the characters and plots in a smooth and timely manner. Season 2 kicks off straight away with suspense and curiosity. Season 3 is more family and drama based but is used so that the audience can connect to the characters even more and can feel for them. Season 4 is amazing. Every episode had its 'HOLY SH*T' moments. And lastly, season 5 is a masterpiece. The ending was extremely satisfying and left an imprint in your mind for days, weeks and months. <br/><br/>For the people missing out on Breaking Bad. You are missing out on a revolutionary show. From start to finish, this show will get you thinking, will make you sad, laugh and leave you to think that you were in an experience like no other. The Walking Dead is nothing compared to this masterpiece. I have got to admit I am not much of a TV show fan, but BrBA made me one.<br/><br/>I finished watching seasons 1 through 5 in less than a month. I guess you can understand how addictive BrBa is from that.<br/><br/>I tried watching several other TV shows but nothing came close. The most exciting feature of the show that I found is Mr. Walter White and his brilliance. Walter White is easily one of my favorite fictitious characters of all time.<br/><br/>The five seasons deal with different issues and all are equally incredible.<br/><br/>I have never felt so sad when a movie or TV show ended. It was truly heartbreaking, I thank the Breaking Bad team for making such an awesome show.<br/><br/>Miss you Mr. White! It is the best TV show ever. EVERYONE is going to find it awesome. You watch it and your mind goes crazy.<br/><br/>If you watch 4 seasons, you are still not very sure about some things.. whats the real relationship between the two main characters? Do they like each other, or not?Do they care, or is it all about the money?? They play with your mind all the time. And the last season clears everything you have been wondering.<br/><br/>As about the main character, Heisenberg, the words are not enough. During the seasons you see his character changing and you can actually see his face changing.. What an amazing actor!<br/><br/>Every and each one of the characters is amazing. And thats the main reason why the show is so great.. You love love love them all! Even the ones you hate.. Breaking Bad represents an absolute example of putting the best ingredients (actors, directing, script, ...) in the filming recipe, which is really what makes the difference, i.e. you cannot say which part of the series is the strongest one. Another innovative characteristic of the show is the fact that it lacks irrelevant scenes put there just to fill the episode (e.g. see Vince Masuka role in Dexter, especially season 8). Thus, the script and the plot is very solid focusing around the characters created with an amazing and extraordinary way. Walter White (Bryan Cranston) is the most evolving character in TV history, starting from the "good" side and gradually going to the "bad" one, which justifies absolutely the show's title. The last season of Breaking Bad reaches the highest peak as far as acting is concerned with powerful dialogs and could easily represent an original Greek drama. Thanks everyone in Breaking Bad for the best moment in TV history which I definitely recommend. After watching the series Finale...Its time to post a review about this AWESOME SERIES....Breaking Bad is the best Drama series I have seen till date....The way they ended Season 4, we thought that should be it...but after watching the Series Finale...IT WAS ICING ON THE CAKE.... Its not about Walter or Jessie as a main characters. But each and everyone has given their best shot.Saul, Hank, Gus, Tuco...everyone has delivered their best career performance. At the end, credit goes to Vince who casted the perfect lineup, no wonder 50% of the main cast was in comic stream before this,,,especially Walter and Saul...but Vince pulled it out of em. For me he is the Christopher Nolan of small screen.WE WILL MISS YOU BREAKING BAD ....BADLLLYYYY!!! Even though I don't write reviews very often, I will do this for this one. BB is one of the best TV shows in the last 10 years for sure. Brilliant storyline, unexpected twists, great acting and a great ending (unlike Dexter).<br/><br/>Lot of people talk about great actors who played Walt and Pinkmann, but my other favorites was the sleazy lawyer (brilliantly cast) and Skylar, Walts wife!<br/><br/>I think why this series is so great is that no character is black or white. They are very much on the gray scale- all characters have flaws and everyone can relate/understand them to a degree.<br/><br/>Of course Walts choice to start making drugs is questionable to many. But I think most people can relate to mid life crisis, desperation, self fulfillment and love for the family. We all make bad choices sometimes, but thankfully not as bad as Walt.<br/><br/>One thing I take with me after BB, is that even though we all have choices in life, we never really know where they are going to take us... I started watching the series on Netflix the day before the premiere of the final season aired on AMC. It had been on my "laundry list" of shows to watch since about the middle of it's second season but I had never gotten around to watching it because I was just prepared that it wouldn't completely blow me away. So instead I watched Supernatural, Doctor Who, Sherlock, It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia, The Office and many, many other TV shows. <br/><br/>To my disappointment, I should have tuned in when the very first episode was aired. <br/><br/>Breaking Bad has taken the entire genre of TV dramas and TV shows in general to a new height of not only shock value but excellent writing and casting. Nearly each episode you're sitting on the edge of your seat wondering what is going to happen next. Instead of one upping the previous episode by it's dramatic scenes or crazy ways of the illegal drug production, sale and so on, the writers make the absolute unexpected happen. It may seem like a lot of people say things such as, "It's so crazy, you won't even see it coming." in instances that it may be unexpected, but that is where Breaking Bad changed everything. It is impossible to tell what will happen next because that's just how well it is written and thought of. Down to each and every last detail is pressed out and made sure to be perfect before filming for the episode I'm sure even begun. <br/><br/>Don't pass up Heisenberg. I don't even want to write a review. Breaking Bad IS the best show to ever grace TV screens, and unless Vince Gilligan outdoes himself in the future with an even better show (however hard to fathom) this IS and WILL BE the best show you'll ever see. I would now like to see Gilligan get into the movies and pull another trick out of his hat. This is the golden age of TV and Breaking Bad is its flagship, thanks to cast, cinematographers, directors, and most of all Vince Gilligan, the show's creator, and his co-writers. I hope these talents spill into cinema, grab it by the horns and give it a good shake up, because it needs people with attributes, BADLY! I have enjoyed every episode of this show. It has the best cinematography I've seen in a show with it's scenery and colour enhancement and the definition of everything to make effect on how the programme wants you to feel. Also, the acting is just amazing. The dark theme of this show really makes it that much more awesome because there just isn't a show like it, aside from 'Death note'. I love how the story line is so well thought out and constructed. The progression of the show and transformation of each character is simply great! The pilot is amazing and the episode I just watched "Ozymandias" is stunning. The show makes you feel emotions and really takes you into it, it makes a lot of people feel like they're actually experiencing what the characters are experiencing emotionally. The show is the most intense show I've ever seen and I've watched 'death note' and many other TV show's (Dexter, game of thrones, the x files, sons of anarchy etc); but Breaking bad beats them all. It is just incredible in so many ways, I love the way it makes me feel and it has elements of every emotion which I think is great, although the comedy is very dark, it is still comedy and I think it's great that they managed to fit that element in. I love how this is a show with a story line that has to end and I think that with it ending in the next 2 episodes, it is a wise decision and I'm glad the directors and writers have chosen to end it now as it show's that they are wanting this show to go out with a bang and it also show's they are wanting a good story line rather than a long lasting show for money. So for my conclusion: I would recommend this show to everyone who can experience it, I love this show and I am really sad that it is coming to an end yet it is right to end it now. I won't get into the debate about "best" show ever, b/c there's no such thing, but it's certainly my FAVORITE show ever, and everything in it is perfect for my sensibilities. Cranston as Walt is manic and focused at the same time. Jesse Pinkman's a reasonable yet amoral character, drifting through life complaining about the things he himself is the cause of. Directing is top notch consistently while you can still spot the stylistic differences of various people behind the camera, and the variety of villains is each given their own aesthetic. The most under- appreciated part of that aesthetic IMO is the color choice, harsh reds and yellows and a hideous New Mexico bleak background.<br/><br/>Simply put I love everything about this show, enough that I even made this art for it with my favorite quotes.<br/><br/>http://tinyurl.com/plqugld This show is amazing, with a story that is very intriguing, and suburb acting to really make it shine. Episodes are thrilling and exciting, keeping you interested until the end, then ending the episode with very suspenseful cliffhangers to make you anticipate the next episode, constantly thinking about what might happen next. When the next episode airs, it doesn't disappoint, further increasing your addiction to this show about making drugs.<br/><br/>The characters are all very well thought out, all with their own important roles to make this the best show currently airing on TV. Following the actions of chemistry teacher Walter White, this show takes you on a journey of meth cooking goodness. However, it's so much more than just a show that some drug addict would watch, it is a show with the potential of being loved by anyone.<br/><br/>If you haven't watched this show, get on it. From the pilot, all the way to the finale, you will be hooked and unable to stop watching. Now stop reading reviews on this and start watching it. This show will go down in history as one of TV's best dramas of all time. I have been a big fan since the beginning, and AMC does a terrific job with this show. <br/><br/>Walter White (Bryan Cranston) plays a 50 year old, run-of-the-mill chemistry teacher with really no excitement in his life. The day after his 50th, he finds out he has terminal lung cancer, with maybe only a couple of years to live. Walter discovers from his brother-in-law Hank Schrader (Dean Norris) that selling meth can make a lot of money, which Walter wants in order to secure his family's financial future since his wife Skylar (Anna Gunn) is making very meager income. <br/><br/>Walter teams up with his ex-flunked out student, Jessie Pinkman (Aaron Paul) to make the meth and sell it to customers so he can make at least $737,000.<br/><br/>That's the beginning of the series. As time goes on, Walt and Jessie team up with a number of kingpins and other drug operators, and both of them begin to turn to violence in order to protect their power and safety in the world. As they gain more power, Walt's family begins to learn about the business (except his son, Walt Jr.-played by RJ Mitte). The family feels very threatened and now see Walt as a monster who continued to lie to them. In the final season now, it's a fight for survival for Walt, Jessie, and the rest of the White-Schrader family.<br/><br/>There"s your plot. However, this show is brilliant for a number of reasons. But the key idea is definitely character development. In the very first episode, Walt makes a video crying and telling his family he was sorry, and that everything he did was for them. Then, in a very eerily similar way, in Season 5 Episode 3, Walt made a video blaming the whole meth operation on Hank, with no remorse in his voice. Walt, once an innocent lamb, now has turned into a villain. The whole crew at AMC did a wonderful job with this series, and I'm going to be upset when it ends. I cannot say it enough-The character development from season one to 5 is incredible. I am seeing some blossom, some deteriorate, some grow stronger-Its what keeps you wanting more! Totally worth starting at Season 1 Episode 1 if you have been considering it, jumping in the middle means you lose a lot of what makes you salivate for the next episode, that being the hints and sparks of things yet to come. You fall in love with Jesse's adversities and Walter is a character you can almost understand because of the things he encounters-even on his extreme level, you can still get him and who he is. So much action and hidden messages or jokes, its like seeing a new clue every time you re-watch the episodes. There is nothing I can really say negatively about this show overall. Some episodes are full of build up and can be anti-climactic but if you feel you are losing faith-give it another episode and your mind will be blown. Its one of the best shows I have seen out these days-I find myself cursing out loud because I become so invested in the action and the plot. I suggest this for anyone who enjoys movies such as clockwork orange or Django. Since the first episode I started to watch, I couldn't stop. Breaking Bad name is given very correctly to the movie... It takes you from basics of life to somewhere you don't or can't imagine that yourself could be there.. decisions of 'being bad' based on what? Answer is here.. It can be you your friend or whoever.. Just check it out.. Reality, comedy, heavy drama everything is together.. It is a dark movie.. I enjoyed watching it.. I strongly recommend.. All players deserves high credits.. Excellent work... I am surprised why it is not that famous world wide or it hasn't reach high viewer ratings like house m.d. or lost.. however even if you haven't watch, I am sure you'll here the movies name a lot in the near future.. I never thought that there will be a show (or a movie) deserving only superlatives when spoken (or written) of.<br/><br/>Words simply can't describe this series.<br/><br/>The writing, the acting, every little bit and piece - simply WOW!<br/><br/>Watch it, and get blasted away by this genius piece of art.<br/><br/>The only problem with BB is that after watching it all other series simply are no fun to watch.<br/><br/>I do think, that this is the highest point where a TV series could get, and doubt that it'll be changed any time soon.<br/><br/>I'll leave it at that, no need for spoiling. Calling Breaking Bad a drama is a gross understatement. It transcends all other dramas and all other shows of any category. Watching the pilot is like reaching into a bag of potato chips and pulling out the first chip. It's delicious and tasty and you want to eat the whole bag.  The main character is Walter White, an extremely overqualified high school chemistry teacher who has gone through most of his life without making any decisions for himself. He has a wife who loves him and a disabled son and his unconditional love for them is amazing. During his second job at a run down carwash, he passes out and is sent to the hospital where he finds out he has stage 4 inoperable lung cancer. Walt's reaction to this news is one of the most brilliant things I've seen. The doctor is explaining it to him and all Walt can think about is a mustard stain on the doctor's lab coat. It's the perfect metaphor for Walt's personality. The combination of cancer and everyone trampling all over him his whole life causes him to "break bad" and do what he needs in order to provide for his family, even if that includes cooking meth. Walt didn't just decide on meth out of the blue though. His brother in the DEA takes him to a meth lab bust where he runs into an old student, Jessie. Jessie is an underachieving punk who cooks and sells meth in his free time. Walt sees him as a business partner and it's the beginning of a beautiful and twisted friendship. Walt uses his chemistry expertise to cook the best meth anyone has seen and Jessie helps him distribute. The struggles that Walt and Jessie go through keep you on the edge of your seat to the point where you fall off. All of the acting in the show is amazing. We instantly see ourselves in Walt and the whole point of the show is that none of us would do any different if we were him. I don't know how perfect writing, perfect acting, and perfect cinematography all came together in one show, but it's a perfect storm that will never happen again (and wont last forever due to the cancer eating away at Walt). It's the best show I've ever seen by far and it puts all other shows to shame. A few episodes in and you'll be addicted to it like meth and you'll love every second. Well, i started to watch Breaking Bad very late so i had to hurry to catch up with AMC schedules.<br/><br/>Knowing that, and needing to hurry, i watched like the 3 first seasons in 2 weeks, with several episodes a day.<br/><br/>I found first season pretty boring, because of the lack of violence and major events. But, let's face it, screenwriters & creator had to take time to set a solid background for the show. In this season, you barely only learn about Hank's (main character) family & Jesse's (Supporting role) past more than 'how to really cook good meths ?'.<br/><br/>For the second season, the show offers lot more, especially in violence, verbal and physic and some nice drug dealing.<br/><br/>Then, after watching season number 2, i personally had huge expectations, wondering if Hank & Jesse would finally grow and become the most famous drug dealers. And so did they !<br/><br/>They meet their boss, Gustavo (probably the best character in that show, in my opinion) and become more and more bad, starting killing people, even though they had a rule against that. 3rd and 4th seasons will grab your guts and make you want for more.<br/><br/>I won't say anything further, just advice people who might read this comment to watch Breaking Bad and they won't regret it.<br/><br/>10/10. Seriously what is all the hype about? <br/><br/>I watched it all the way through expecting more, skyler really winds me up. Her husband is making money and she wants a divorce? Laughable, and then when she needs money she goes to him?!<br/><br/>This is boring compared to Dexter, sons of anarchy, prison break etc. <br/><br/>Walt makes drugs for money, survives and continues until something goes bad. <br/><br/>His wife and son do my bulb in! Without these it would be better! <br/><br/>The episodes are so slow, granted there's a few Good episodes.<br/><br/>Really disappointed considering everyone rates it a 10 Please note that this review has plot spoilers.<br/><br/>I liked seasons 1 and 2 but was never very enthusiastic about it. It was thrilling but I would never compare "Breaking Bad" to series such as "The Wire" or "The Sopranos". Then again I am raising the bar too high. Let me be more realistic: This series is not as as good as series such as "The Good Wife", for example. It is certainly more exciting than "The Good Wife" but it is not so well structured because it runs in circles, instead of moving forward. The original plot, as good as it was, proved to be limited. They don't really have much to go on after two seasons so they started to do variations of the same plot. Variations that contradict and weaken the original story.<br/><br/>Indeed I think that"Breaking Bad", after watching its third season, is a minor TV series. <br/><br/>The hand-held camera was just bearable in the first two seasons but it gets far worse in season 3. The wobbling is now constant and many times is abrupt, jerky. The close ups are especially irritating because you can't really look at the actors as the camera doesn't stop shaking. Of course, it is done on purpose because no cameraman working in a prime time TV series could be that bad.<br/><br/>It is done on purpose because of the short span of attention of whoever is the idiot behind the idea of shooting all episodes as if the series is actually happening in a ship on high seas.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the story itself is also not solid. Season 3 has two new and ridiculous characters: Two assassins, carrying an axe around town, who could very well be in 'Saw XXII, the real last chapter' or any of those horror movies made for tedious teenagers.<br/><br/>Then, there is the absolutely not credible Jesse Pinkman who, despite being a loose canon, is still alive and well. Too well, actually. Faced with the possibility of making 1.5 million dollars in three months he decides that it would be better to open a divergent, dangerous and completely unnecessary "business" of selling drugs on his own to make a fraction of the money he could make in a far safer way. It insults the intelligence of the public. <br/><br/>The directors of the series already ran out of ideas and are creating very artificial situations just to keep the series going on, no matter its growing lack of logic and credibility. I just couldn't believe when, in one sequence, the big boss meets personally with two street drug dealers. He, who was always so careful to keep his facade of a conservative and responsible businessman, was exposing himself in a way that didn't match with him at all.<br/><br/>Even more senseless is to see mister White, who became a criminal in order to provide for his family, risking everything he achieved to save Jesse Pinkman. The core of this series is that Mr. White's family comes first, no matter what. Mr. White would do anything, even become a drug dealer as he did , to provide for his family. Then he risks loosing his own life and the millions he was going to make for his family in order to save Jesse Pinkman! Let's not forget that Mr. White killed people before and let an innocent young woman die in order to protect his "business".<br/><br/>The only logical explanation for the many times he saves Jess, especially the two last ones, is that his family doesn't come first. Season 4 comes first...<br/><br/>The creators of the series want hard Jesse Pinkman in the story because he is the one with whom young people, the main public of this series, could somehow identify with. Jesse Pinkman can do all kind of stupid things and get away with them because, as long as there is a new season coming, he is immortal.<br/><br/>Season 3 has now several flash backs to explain things that happened during seasons 1 and 2. One flash back, for example, explains how Jesse Pinkman got a RMV. The first problem with that flashback is that it shows Jesse and his friends partying the whole night. One of the friends who was in the party, if you check season 1's episodes, was actually in jail by that time...<br/><br/>It is most revealing about the weakness of season 3 that a whole episode is about the chasing of a fly. Yes, they wanted to show Mr. White's state of mind but a whole episode? Besides, Mr White, whilst chasing the fly in a laboratory, falls from a height of about 5 meters, hits a big machine and from there lands on a hard floor.<br/><br/>There is no way he wouldn't have, at least, broken a few bones but he was perfectly fine a few hours after the accident, the only memory of it being a band-aid on his head... And one of the most advertised qualities of this series is its credibility... I actually read that many people think this series is the best TV series ever. It is disheartening.<br/><br/>Season 3 ends with a big cliff hanger. I am pretty sure that it will be another cry wolf, like the so misleading cliff hanger from the last episode of season 2.<br/><br/>I can actually guess most of what is going to happen before it happens. Season 3 should have been the end of this series but, having in mind season 4, they over stretched the story. Many illogical things that happened in series 3 happened just to justify a fourth season. <br/><br/>I dread to think in being subjected to another season of mediocre wobbling camera-work, reason why I will not watch season 4. Besides, season 4 will have all kind of unconvincing situations just for the sake of a fifth season. Let me start by saying that I am not trying to start a fight or insult anyone, just expressing my own opinion. It's very hard for me to get into new shows as I find them quite repetitive; to me, "Breaking Bad" was no exception. <br/><br/>I don't know or understand how this show got so many 10/10 reviews. I have to agree the writing was good, but after a while I found a lot of it redundant. It was simple- two guys manufacture meth, they need a distributor, the find a distributor,their partnership goes sour with their distributor, they find a way to kill their distributor, rinse, repeat....add in a little moral questioning, some bromance and there you have it- how to write "Breaking Bad." <br/><br/>Personally speaking (again), I found shows like Nip/Tuck (though far more far-fetched)a great deal more interesting and creative than BB. <br/><br/>Again, just my opinion Honestly, this show is about the increasingly poor decisions of an egotistical bratty man-child who has every opportunity in the world to do right by himself and his family, but still chooses to do wrong with every opportunity presented to him, and, of course, his poorly adjusted younger side-kick. I don't find this show as "amazing" as some people oddly seem to find it, but it is a decent show that dramatizes the lives and lifestyles of the meth world from the perspectives of a man trying to live a double life and those who circle around him. Breaking Bad has a good cast that helps tie everything together, which helps save the show from itself when the writing gets a bit wishy-washy and over-the-top. It's entertaining and keeps the viewer coming back for more. All in all, this is a good watch, but expect to cringe at the broken decisions of broken people doing broken things. Pure art. Pure suspense. Pure thrill. Pure comedy. Pure story. Pure meth!<br/><br/>You know what movies (particularly drama), show us? Actors playing some story making the audience, think it as a real life experience. But whatever movie/TV series it is, at some point of time, you get disengaged with grip of the reality of drama and think, that actually is a movie. Of course, who am I kidding! it is a movie. But do you want to get an experience where you wouldn't feel like you're watching a movie, but rather to have a kind of immersion in the story and get all the excitement and suspense you'd get in your life, if Breaking Bad's story happened for real? Then, don't turn your back on this.<br/><br/>From beginning to end, you feel like you're watching the one that happened to be in television's most dark and thrilling adventurous storyline you'd ever experience as a real one in life.<br/><br/>For people who say the play is slow and dull - First of all, you people don't get the sense of an art of making a movie. For the watcher, to believe, director should develop a storyline to be real. So I suggest, while you're watching this, and if you get bore, then rethink. Because that part of the scene will be a prerequisite for rest of the plot. Every frame, every scene, pays off!<br/><br/>For people who say the play consists uncanny bloodshed and obnoxious language - Yes, it does. But, do you want to get the reality of situations the actors face according to the plot? If no, then don't watch.<br/><br/>I am not exaggerating here but I'd say this - If I ever get a supernatural power to erase a part of memory from my brain, then I'd delete the memory what is considered to be the experience I got from breaking bad. Just because, I can watch it again. Nevertheless, no matter how many times you watch, you just scratch your head, how brilliant this is.<br/><br/>Finally, for people who haven't seen it yet - I envy you guys. But, only if you want to watch. Breaking bad is a benchmark. I doubt any TV series surpasses this in the future. I am with Barry Winters on this one, one of the other reviewers. When I started watching this show, it gave me an instant high. By the time I was in the middle of the first season I felt it was addictive. However, as the story progressed I came to a realization that show lacked soul...it got all the right ingredients for entertainment but no soul...kind of like the discussion the main character has with his girlfriend in one of the earlier episodes where he breaks down what constitutes a human body and the certain percentage he couldn't figure it out she attributes it to the soul. On a similar note, I will say the show is like crystal meth on which it is based on, will give you great entertainment but would add little to you as a person or may even take out some element of humanity out of you. I am in the middle of second season and I think I will space this show out instead of watching it as regularly. I would like to believe there are better things and better people in this world then what is portrayed on this show... Unforgettable, an instant classic, Breaking Bad delivers in every department.<br/><br/>It's such a joy to escape and delve into Walter Whites world, escaping your own for a while.<br/><br/>Sublimely written, an amazing plot that unfolds perfectly and leaves you wanting and waiting for more, Cranston brings Walter to life so much so you get pulled in and absorb everything, but hats off to many of the cast especially Aaron Paul, Dean Norris, RJ Mitte, Bob Odenkirk and Anna Gunn.<br/><br/>Annas character Skyler was also amazing, I found myself hating Skyler which just lends and validates Annas skill set as an actress.<br/><br/>What an incredible show Breaking Bad is, it has raised the bar and left me saddened it's over. I've watched Breaking Bad through completely twice (to be nice to others). Both times were complete torture. How brain dead must someone be to find any aspect of this vapid, moronic, poor excuse for writing entertaining?<br/><br/>Every "plot twist" was chosen from a hat of notes written by monkeys/Donald Trump (same..... ""thing""), and then had the episode written by what I can only assume is someone who was looking to torture audiences with every sentence. It's........... I'm at such a loss of words over how horrible every episode, every line, and every garbage scene of terrible acting is (from otherwise good actors).<br/><br/>The only progression of plot is caused by completely implausible stupidity and incredibly convenient coincidences. I found myself wanting to kill myself more than Jesse over the heinous crimes against humanity that is the garbage pile of mega-hyped Breaking Bad. If anyone actually took more than two seconds out of their heroin addled states to think about what anyone is doings or saying, they would be forced to agree.<br/><br/>The women exist in this show only as nagging, one-dimensional road-blocks. Designed entirely to take up episode time where the writers were too lazy or ill-talented enough to design an interesting plot. You can, without any exaggeration at all, eliminate 99% of all scenes containing Whatsherface and Theotherone without harming the """""""""""""plot"""""""""" at all (and I use the word "plot" intolerably loosely). <br/><br/>It's shameful how completely vapid and pointless women were made in this show, often being killed off with no regard just because the writer's didn't possess any self-respect or talent enough to write a decent script, so it was the only way to make Jesse or Walter's part more..... what? What exactly? Please, they were pathetic cop-outs for lazy writers that couldn't be bothered to do anything worthwhile with their time or ours. <br/><br/>Each time I was forced to watch this garbage, it was the worst kind of psychological torture. If I had secret government secrets and terrorists captured me, they could make me talk instantly by only threatening to make me watch every episode again.<br/><br/>I cannot dissuade people enough from wasting 5 seasons of television on this..... this..... this lack of /anything/ of substance. Having just watched the finale of Breaking Bad, I can now say that it is one of the few series that work perfectly from beginning to end. This isn't to say it couldn't be criticized - it was often far fetched, and in the first season the series didn't quite have a hold of its characters, with Walter making some overly-sudden shifts and Jesse's IQ seemingly wandering up and down - but it was always incredibly intelligent and entertaining, the acting was always amazing, and the show managed to effortlessly move from gritty realism to flights of fancy (like that mariachi song that began one episode).<br/><br/>It is wondrous how beautifully formed character arcs are. Walter, who loses tiny pieces of his soul in ever episode, Jesse, who lets himself be lead into deeper and deeper waters, and Skyler, whose underrated (and often castigated) role is perhaps most relatable; she has to choose between the rock and the hard place, and knows from the start that there are no good options. <br/><br/>What's most impressive about Breaking Bad is it never fell apart. There were no extraneous episodes, no period where it lost momentum or seemed to be treading water. The show moved with purpose. It knew what it was about - consequences and arrogance - and it never lost sight of that. It was a series that remained true to itself. Some series start great and lose their way (Lost), some series fall apart in the end (Battlestar Gallactica), some get taken over by people with a different vision (Gilmore Girls), some brilliant series get canceled in the first season, so no matter how good that ending was going to be, we'll never see it (Earth II). Breaking Bad gave us five virtually perfect years, and the only thing bad about it is now that it's over I need to find something new to binge watch. IF YOU'RE A "BREAKING BAD" FAN WHO LIVES IN LOS ANGELES...<br/><br/>...don't miss the LA Times' FREE "Breaking Bad" screening this Tuesday night at 7:30pm at the Arclight! <br/><br/>There will be a 20 min clip reel recapping the first season, followed by a panel featuring Bryan Cranston, RJ Mitte, Anna Gunn, Dean Norris, Betsy Brandt, and Aaron Paul, as well as exec producers Vince Gilligan and Mark Johnson!!<br/><br/>Tickets are FREE (and include a free popcorn and soda), but seating is on a first-come, first-served basis. Bring friends who aren't watching the show so they can see what they're missing! Having watched the first four seasons, my take is that "Breaking Bad" is a fairy tale about a chemist who gets cancer and then starts cooking drugs to pay for his treatment. Acting and shooting is good and the show is entertaining but it has major plausibility issues. If you have enjoyed "Better Call Saul" and don't mind some large logical gaps in the plot, you may like this one too. After watching this play, I have two thoughts: Firstly, don't annoy people with knowledge. Secondly, the most common life details that have been ignored are the ones that make people nostalgic for life. For example, the sound of the vacuum cleaner and the smell of the wife's cream. Breaking Bad is seriously an awful experience! A one time expirience. This tv show's got perfect story perfect cast perfect screenplay most importantly a great finish. I watched the pilot episode a long ago but don't know why just didn't continue. And I just finished this sensational show and became an all time fan. If anyone trying to discontinue like me after pilot episode I give a big no. It's a story of a chemistry teacher who's suffering from lung cancer and just wanna leave enough money for his family after him. But this man get into this meth world and becomes a king of it. As of that realizes he gained a lot of hatred from his own family. It's got a mesmerizing plot. Vince Gillian just made us see how a very good person can change down to a very dark person with adding a pure blue meth! Salute to vince! Mr. Robot will always be my favourite, but damn if Breaking Bad didn't come close. Ok, so while it isn't quite the holy grail it's made out to be, 'Breaking Bad' is a solid series. I give it a concrete 7. It is well worth watching. It absolutely IS a good series. Just allow for a steady stream of implausible moments throughout the series where various story points just aren't remotely believable.
Enjoy the good (there is plenty), and look over the ludicrous (there is plenty). Enjoy the show. Best series there ever was, there ever is and there ever will be. Period This show. I have to say this is the closest I think I've ever seen a show or movie come to perfection. The acting is outstanding from every actor, even smaller characters, the writing is phenomenal (Vince Gilligan and the team are amazing). Even the cinematography is brilliant! The only problem is that it ends, but at least it didn't overstay it's welcome. Breaking Bad is an amazing and astonishing show that you can watch it again spot more details. Vince Gilligan is a mad genius. Breaking Bad will hold a special place in my heart. This is probably the best show I've seen and I will ever see.
I wanna hit reset in my mind and watch it again.
FML Honestly I can't praise this show enough, every single thing about this show is amazing. The acting, screenplay, cinematography, directing, score, soundtrack, dialogue, set design, costume design, editing, makeup, art direction, visual effects, sound effects. Literally everything is phenomenal! The best show on TV. I just finished watching the last episode. A 5 season, 62 episode series with that much attention to details. Definitely will be watching again. I always heard about Breaking Bad, but I never thought it was the show for me. But one day I started to watch it, as soon as the first episode was done I was hooked. The show has amazing writing and great acting, each episode leaves you wanting more. You get really attached to the characters. Excellent I was a late bloomer with this one, skeptical at first that I could get into a show about meth. Once I got through the first season I was hooked. Each season gets progressively better than the last, a rarity when it comes to television these days. Hands down one of the best shows of all time! Daamn purely gold, i mean best show i ever watched, forget about the others, just 5 seasons, you ain't gonna be dissapointed Vince Gilligan's "Breaking Bad" represents how deep and powerful character study and storytelling can be. There is not a single flaw with the show. Its superb script, accompanied by some of the most convincing and haunting performances from its incredible cast. "Breaking Bad" is also fairly short, compared to other successful shows on television. It had balls to end at its best, where other accomplished TV series would not. The wild character of Walter White is impeccable, his grand intelligence is constantly portrayed brilliantly by Bryan Cranston. White slowly evolves into a completely different individual, one that his old self would fear. BrBa is most definitely a piece of modern art that everyone should experience. Breaking Bad begins as a gory and short-scripted plot with not much wiggle room, and by season 2 will have you hooked like a blow-fish on its bait on endless plot-twists and innumerable synchrinistic situations that include the dynamic interaction of all actors equally intertwined with the plot itself. <br/><br/>Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul, and Dean Norris are nothing short of pheonominally sharp in their roles. The acting is fantastic. The plot is unique, intriguing, and nonetheless extremely entertaining despite the x-rated gore of blood guts rarely depicted in any series comparable. <br/><br/>Having only watched slightly under half of the series so far, it's hard to give much more input, but I still felt compelled to write a review on my behalf of my enjoyment so far. It is definitely a recommend choice of mine for netflix or as a series in general. I know films can be amazing and all but sometimes TV shows are truly something else. I felt it with Game of Thrones and recently with Westworld, but the first time I truly realized how incredible TV shows can be was when I saw Breaking Bad. It honestly blew me away. The acting (especially from Cranston), the story, the characters, the direction, the cinematography, the editing, etc. were all phenomenal and I was just in awe of its craft (especially as the show progressed). Ozymandias or Face Off might honestly be the best 50 minutes of anything I've ever seen. Breaking Bad is, without a doubt, one of the greatest forms of entertainment ever. What an epic TV series!. Best TV shows ever!. I really lovely this TV series!. <br/><br/>I seen a lot of series, and this is one of the best!. I never like so many characters in a TV series, only in this TV series!. They really build deep strong character! And not only to the leading actor but as well as to the supporting actor and actress!. I enjoy to watch partnership and friendship between Walter White and Jesse Pinkman. <br/><br/>The cast that I love: Walter White: Jesse Pinkman Hank Schader Saul Goodman<br/><br/>I seen a lot of movies and series since the year 2004. Bottom line, this TV series is the most epic TV series that i ever seen in my entire life!. I remember, watching BB the first time, I was emotionally messed up for at least two weeks after watching the final episode. Usually I was messed up just a week, until the next episode, so I got my shot for another week.<br/><br/>Now I watched BB again, 2 years later. Just finished season 5. Guess what, I feel all messed up again. This show is one of the most emotional things I ever watched on TV. And I am a pretty cold blooded Man that has not much emotions going on inside. Maybe some episodes in GoT let me feel the same way. And that's why these two are the best shows in TV history. The summary may be a bit biased because it's one of my favourite shows, however since it used to be the second best show on the best rated TV shows list on IMDb and it's one of the only shows I know that can make a filler episode really good. The show follows the story of Walter White, a chemistry teacher that has been diagnosed with lung cancer. His brother in the DEA shows him how they do drug raids in which he finds out one of his ex-students, Jesse Pinkman, has become a drug dealer. They become partners in being meth cooks, Walt does mostly the cooking and Jesse does mostly the business. As the series goes on, they meet people like Saul Goodman, a lawyer that acts as a money launder and Gus Fringe, the main drug kingpin in the ABQ. The series shows events like the troubles of being a meth cook, relationship issues between Walt and Jesse, Walt and his family and Walt and his business partners. I highly recommend this series. A very special series. No, the series is like a disdain: a very special production ... great image, great acting, one side. There is an extraordinary scenario. There is no obsession to reach every viewer. I think people who watch and love also shout. There are such powerful and universal psychological surveys that I am constantly amazed to be surprised. The level of realism is very high and sedate. No action obsessions. It is moving towards the best array feature I've ever seen. When the series is over, a person falls into a gap ... I've watched the last scenes many times, I've talked to the people watching, but the time has passed since I saw new series, but that space still stands. I understand that this directory is not going to fill any place in my eye. Breaking Bad is easily the best TV show ever made in my opinion. I've watched a whole lot of TV shows but none get you more hooked and immersed in the action than Breaking Bad.<br/><br/>First of all, the writing from beginning to end is phenomenal. Originally created by Vince Gilligan to be a dark humor you can see aspects of that throughout the whole series. As the series progresses it gets a lot more dark and serious. Although they still retain some of the dark humor like in the last episode where Walt says he has the "two best snipers west of the Mississippi" trained on Gretchen and Elliot and really it's just Badger and Skinny Pete with a laser pointer. The cast is another great thing about this show with each character developing in their own way and transforming over the series. Bryan Cranston did an especially good job. Coming from someone who hadn't seen very serious roles before Breaking Bad it really showcased his versatility as an actor.<br/><br/>I've known a few people who hadn't seen Breaking Bad and I had to convince them that they needed to! Most thank me and say it's better than any show they've ever watched before. So if you're on the edge about whether or not to watch this show I'd recommend watching it A.S.A.P.! If there is one show which has absolutely no flaws throughout the series, it has to be Breaking Bad. The show just kept on improving from earlier seasons. 2nd was better than 1st, 3rd than 2nd, 4th than 3rd and 5th was the ultimatum. Nevertheless, all the seasons were just mind blowing. I loved the transformation of Walter White in to Heisenberg. The same guy who thought $737,000 was what enough to support his family after he is gone, even millions couldn't cater his thirst. The scene in which he says "Just, say my Name" in S5 just gave me goose bumps even for a second viewing. Each and every character in the series was there for a reason and each of them had their presence felt. That's what is magnificent about the series. Casting is brilliant and acting is top notch. I don't think there is any other actor who could portray Walter White as Bryan Cranston did. Hands down!! I strongly recommend it. I have only seen a few episodes of this show, but I can see why people liked it so much! The plot was certainly different, with a chemistry teacher learning he has lung cancer and turning to making and selling crystal meth with one of his former students to provide financial stability for his family. I liked the scenes where they make the drug deal attempts and try to hide where they're making the stuff. I also think the scenes where he's with his family and his wife is pregnant-those are very touching. If this were a sitcom, the scenes where he's trying to hide what he's doing from his family would be funny! I loved to scene in the first episode where he coerces the student into helping him into helping him, and I like scene in an episode where the wife tries to return a gift and gets arrested for shoplifting it! This was one of the best shows of all time. *** out of **** "Breaking Bad" is something we rarely see these days, and there is a hunger for it – the well-done morality play. This one was brilliantly done. The show demonstrated, often in surprising ways, that actions have consequences, and how lying destroys relationships, and how deadly is the fine art of rationalizing immoral actions. Even when we didn't know where the story was going, no matter how unpredictable, it always made sense from that character's point of view – a bit like O. Henry in that regard. No need to suspend disbelief. It was literary in the quality of the writing and artistic in how it was filmed–the unusual camera points of view, taking advantage of the vivid colors of the southwest, the dark humor. The casting was perfect, the acting was perfect, the end was perfect. The last scene was one of the best I've ever seen on film, possibly the best. I watched it more than once. It's seriously hard to review a show like this when it gets everything so perfectly right in every way imaginable. <br/><br/>All the little nuances from all your favorite movies and shows that gave them that special place in your memory; this show nails them all. Every character gets their deserved depth and importance, every episode has meaning, and every little detail between even the smallest unobserved interaction comes back to play it's part; everything you wish would be put into the perfect movie or show is in Breaking Bad.<br/><br/>The reason it's so hard to review it is because the two halves of every review is, "What I liked / What I disliked"... but I honestly can't find anything I didn't like about this show! I'm sure you've already read the typical "acting is top-notch, story is unforgettable, emotion is overwhelming" reviews from everyone who has seen this show - however - the thing that distinguishes Breaking Bad from literally every other show out there is it's ability to keep you hooked (seriously hooked) into what's happening and what will happen next.<br/><br/>Way too many of even the best shows suffer from a plot that starts off amazing, and then either sticks with it for too long, or takes the bold leap to agree that it's been dragging on and tries to change directions, but doesn't live up to what came before it. Many of those plots remain engaging for many years, but inevitably have to change because the audience either gets comfortable with the direction it's headed; ultimately leading to boredom, or because the plot-device used to push each episode forward has a finite amount of time that it can be dangled in front of audiences before they get fed up with feeling led on; losing it's hold over you as an engaging plot-device. <br/><br/>Breaking Bad takes the story, tension, and character attachment as far as humanly possible, and then changes everything up, while somehow simultaneously satisfying everything leading up to that point and then sucking you back in ten-fold to the new changes as if everything before it was just a warm up. It continues with this always-fresh, always-enthralling story from the very first episode until the supremely satisfying final episode series finale. <br/><br/>One word of warning though; if you haven't seen Breaking Bad, do not (seriously do not) spoil the story for yourself by reading about it online or from friends. Seeing the show unfold on it's own, the way it was presented on-air from AMC, will leave you feeling so satisfied yet always wanting more after every episode.<br/><br/>This is also the only show I've ever given a full 10/10 rating to - because in the true sense of the 10-star rating, you can not possibly score any higher than a perfect 10; thus it should only be given to those truly perfect shows.<br/><br/>Don't just rent or stream it, this is an absolute Must-Buy! You will be so glad you did! Breaking Bad is an amazing show that perfectly executes an outlook on human nature. With compelling characters and unbeatable story lines, this is easily one of the best TV shows of all time.<br/><br/>It's my #2 favorite show, behind JUSTIFIED, but, this show is fantastic. It's the most intense show I have ever scene, and is the only show to actually bring me to my knees after a very shocking scene. That NEVER happens with me.<br/><br/>Walter White was simply a chemistry teacher, who was working two jobs to provide for his family. But after being diagnosed with cancer, he knows he has to set up a future for his family before he dies. He has a brother in law in the DEA, and teams up with his former student, Jesse Pinkman, who's now a drug dealer, to deal as he cooks meth.<br/><br/>In all, this show is very worth watching, but it's not an action series, where every episode contains a shootout, that's what I like about it, it evens out the violence and the drama perfectly! This show makes you feel something that most shows or even movies for that matter. Vince Gilligan is genius to this great show. Everyone is rooting for the bad guy because he take so much crap for so long and finally he has something that matters to him. The happiest time in his life was last couple of years of his life when he cooking that blue crystal. He able to get all the revenge back from people that screwed him over in his past. The love for family and what your willing to go through to protect them. He to lie cheat and steal from people you love to protect them from the truth. Then having your son tell you he hates you for what you did. I challenge anyone to make a better show then this.Cannot wait for 2014 BETTER CALL SAUL. Bryan Cranston delivers a phenomenal performance as Walter White, the chemistry teacher who turns to selling meth after he finds himself with cancer. the writing is insane it's so good I can't think of a word to describe how good it is. Then you have actors like Aaron Paul and dean Norris who just bring to life these characters with such great depth you feel yourself getting attached more and more as the show goes on and really just a must watch groundbreaking beast of a show, probably the only show I could rewatch over and over again for the rest of my life and not get bored. Thank you Vince Gilligan for bringing this show to life. At first, I thought that 'Breaking Bad' went wrong because the drama was played out over too many seasons. The premise of a high-school science teacher who becomes a meth cook had its dramatic elements, but was primarily comic due to the sheer unlikelihood of the situation. As the audience to a drama, we want to identify with the characters, and we can't sympathize with a protagonist who acts without reason. We did have sympathy for Walter White as a cancer patient in a last-ditch effort to leave money for his family. We wanted him to succeed as a meth chef, and we are only willing to consider his moral dilemmas to the extent that we excused his crimes. Breaking Bad should have placed its protagonist in juxtaposing situations involving drug users, like the season-one relationship between Walter and Jesse. The show should have been about Walt considering the effect of his actions and his interactions with people who use drugs. Instead, the writer thought to make a cinematic crime drama, not the episodic, serio-comic look at a teacher, a man in mid-life, and an apparently upright citizen coming to terms with his hypocrisy and accepting others. In season one, Walt has contempt for Jesse, and we hope that this tense relationship continually resolves itself in camaraderie. Instead, the partners in crime hate each other more, and the conflict makes for a ridiculous spectacle as the series lays waste the best aspect of its first season. VInce Gilligan began with 'The Sopranos' before helming this project, and it is easy to see how a plot about the criminal mind of a high school science teacher was derived from the plot about the average suburban life of a mobster. In the latter, we sympathize with a criminal because we see a vulnerable life behind the goombah violence. In Breaking Bad, we lose sympathy with a vulnerable character becoming an egomaniacal criminal and ruining lives. In the Soprano house, there were few household secrets, and no insufferable moments of vile anti-drama when an audience hates the protagonist. The writers here should have allowed Walt to keep his secret throughout the series, which might have ended when his wife found out. Indeed, the initial story wasn't played out long enough. I find it almost unfathomable that five seasons of a show about making drugs might elapse without the main character even considering to try some. At most, the show could have revealed that Walter was associating with odd individuals and possibly using drugs. The series could have portrayed Walt's teenage son in admiration of Walt's young friends, or a wife who disapproved but was led toward consideration. A plausible familial drama would have been one in which a wife disapproves of her husband in a midlife crisis, condescending to youth. If that led to a divorce, the writers could have created ancillary drama about marriage and children. Anna Gunn would have played an estranged wife, not be wasted in the role of a domestic hostage. She fears for her children's safety, totally despises her husband, but never reports him to the police despite having every reason and opportunity to do so. One wishes that Bryan Cranston had found his character as insufferable as it became. This show was ruined by its early notoriety, and a writer encouraged to take himself too seriously. This is still TV, and the novel idea that Breaking Bad was TV art licensed the stupidity and boring suspense that ensued. I don't get all the hype we found it very slow with not as much action as was hoping for considering how most people said how amazing it was, I mean chasing a fly around his lab all episode. We sat through every episode hoping it would really blow us away, but as any build up started happening it seemed to go nowhere leaving us frustrated. The first episode was the best one but it just seemed like the writers got board. On the plus side Hank was superb and we liked Gus but we just couldn't warm to Walter and Jess. Sorry to be negative I have rated other series like Dexter, walking dead and tyrant very high so I'm not all complete doom and gloom, I just can't believe all the rave reviews but everyone has an opinion. Oh and I have never written a review before I'm just bewildered why people think this is the best series ever. It makes me cringe when I hear people talking about it. Finally was convinced to watch the show due to all the hype.
Was watching with the wife and reached the third season...wow, it felt like forever.
After an episode in season 3 i just came out and told the wifey "I can't do this anymore, I can't watch this". She looked me in my eyes and the relief I saw was heartwarming, she agreed!
I seriously don't know what all that hype was about! I'm giving Breaking Bad a 5 / 10 because it is an example of superb acting and production quality, but very weak and bland story-telling.<br/><br/>The essence of drama is conflict, and Breaking Bad has had one or two moments in 5 seasons. The problem is that every character is beyond reproach. Without a single likable character, the conflict gets sucked out. You're left without any reason to care about the outcome.<br/><br/>If the main character, Walt, were an anti-hero and the story told the tale of a bad-guy who was trying to escape being caught by the good guys, the show would succeed as compelling drama. The problem is that the good guys are nowhere to be found. Walt's "nemesis", his brother in-law Hank, was portrayed in the first season as a power-hungry bully of a cop who loved to toss perpetrators around and verbally assault them. Throughout the series he was utterly vile to his well-meaning wife who wanted to take care of him during an injury, and he has proved himself in later seasons to be every bit as manipulative and dishonest as Walt.<br/><br/>I've watched every episode mostly for lack of anything else to watch, and because it has had a moment or two where the story became compelling (mostly having to do with a drug lord named Gustavo, when the show peaked in my opinion). It is not a bad show, but it does not deserve anywhere near the 9.4 stars it currently has on IMDb.<br/><br/>When every character is a loser who ends up losing in the end, the show becomes reminiscent of a PBS after-school special warning children about the dangers of drugs thinly disguised as drama.<br/><br/>If I were rating the show on acting alone it would get 10 stars. Production value: 10 stars. Writing / story-telling: 1 or 2 stars at best. I don't usually write a review, but 9,6 rating for BB is too much for me. I guess I can understand the ''existential anger'' people feel in the modern world, but WW is not the embodiment of it.<br/><br/>First, as someone who HAD a cancer patient in my family, I'm deeply upset by representation of cancer patients in this series. Sure it's just a ''plot thing'', nowadays everything is f...... narrative, just get along, it will pay off - it's kid's talk. It upsets me. You don't have to embody existential crisis by literal cancerous growth, it's scriptwriting for idiots. You have existential crisis in True detective and you don't have cancer.<br/><br/>Second, is it really ''existential''? I mean, the only thing I see is a high school professor turning into an animal who marks his territory (stay away from my supermarket!). It's libertarianism at it's worst. The big father of the family doesn't take charity, becomes a drug boss, gets angry at anyone who compromises his manhood, says ''I win'' when he ''wins'', wow, and I thought Adorno was joking when he sad TV programme is made for 11 year olds. Eleven year olds on a ''free market''.<br/><br/>You think there's something deep in here, well, there is, deep male insecurity and fear that tries to compensate the lack by criminal activity and masculine hyperrealism. It has been done in Godfather with Italian rednecks - Sicilians. Being a man doesn't mean to be a primitive a$$hole.<br/><br/>Sorry for my English, I really couldn't be bothered to look up the dictionary if I made some grammatical mistakes. There's plenty of chauvinist, patriarchal and libertarian crap in BB, so it makes us even. The first season (10/10) is original, interesting and develops the characters nicely, appearing to learn about each other and the industry they're entering.<br/><br/>The second season (5/10) is interesting but the fumbling character dialogue is tiring, the story is predictable and lost it's way from the originality of season one, perhaps I'm looking for The Wire but instead received a damp squid.<br/><br/>The third season (2/10) is slow, boring, off point, ineptitude character scripting and darn right annoying. I often found my self staring at the wall hoping for the episode to end and question why am I still watching this! You are saved by one or two interesting episodes but except to be dramatically let down immediately afterwards.<br/><br/>The fourth season (3/10) is an improvement on the third but still contains underdeveloped characters, do they not learn from their mistakes, is the script/dialogue written by a snail? It moves at the same pace! Bored. Out of curiosity I borrowed the Breaking Bad DVDs from a friend and watched all episodes before writing this comment. So the first few episodes are okay, some of them are even good. But then it's getting less interesting and I have to say some of the episodes are not just plain stupid, but really really stupid that you would hate yourself and regret having watched it. For instance, there is this one episode (forgot the season and episode number) where these Walter and Jesse guys spend the entire half-hour chasing a fly. And add to that another five to ten minutes of Walter explaining to Jesse why the lab has to be clean. <br/><br/>I finally find out why the rating at IMDb is so high. Most of the people who gave 9/10 stars rated the show when it has just began airing in 2008/2009. I am sure if they watched the rest of the episodes and found out how stupid the rest of the show are they would rate it differently. Now no one can discuss that this is not the best show of all
BB start = 9
GOT start = 10
BB halfway = 10
GOT halfway = 9
BB finale = 10
GOT fianle = 2<br/><br/>Nothing more to say This show is fantastic in every aspect: acting, plot, philosophical messages, character development, cinematography, writing, presentation, etc. I highly recommend this show to everyone!! this review shouldn't be read! not because it contains spoilers, because it doesn't, but because you shouldn't be wasting time reading it while you could and SHOULD be watching the show! PLUS, don't risk reading reviews that contain spoilers, and why?<br/><br/>Its Simple! Breaking Bad is full of content, i mean every episode will be unique, rewarding and addictive but in the end, despite its epic ending, i guarantee you that you will want more! so don't even waste one second of your precious time that you could be using it on watching Breaking Bad! I watched the last episode nearly a month ago, and after that i watched a LOT of TV Shows, and none of them came even close to the fun, the interest, and the anxiety of what is coming next like the one i felt watching Breaking Bad! Then i started watching it again and i have more pleasure replaying it, than any other show i watched for the first time in my life... So other than that, the only thing i can say is that you WILL fall in love with the show, and in each episode even more, cause DAMN it gets better and better! trust me, no wonder the Emmys the Show won, and Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul made Walter White and Jesse Pinkman become Imortals! SO WHAT THE FU** ARE YOU WAITING FOR? GO WATCH IT GO GO GO! A beleaguered teacher who becomes a meth dealer, now there's an idea for a series! At this point, I'm not sure who hasn't seen Breaking Bad. If you haven't, I'll give you quick run-down on why I think it's a great watch.<br/><br/>Walt is nothing like me. I'm a 4th grade teacher, he's a high school chemistry teacher. He's unhappy in his married, I'm quite happy. The one thing he has going for him that I identify with is the desire for something better. He wants better healthcare and instead of waiting for the union to come through for him, he takes the situation into his own hands.<br/><br/>Through the course of a few episode he becomes a meth maker and small time distributor. The drama follows that as well as the rapidly deterioration of his marriage. His wife is a total bitch. I can't really blame him for wanting to get out f the house. She dreams up ideas that he should do and then forces him into them. You get the fleeting notion from time to time there was once something between them but as for the now, the marriage is on its last leg.<br/><br/>Walt partners up with an ex-student Jesse who knows the street smarts of the game. Between the two of them they rake in cash along with mounds of trouble. It seems the more they make, the closer they come to being caught or killed. They have adventures involving local drug rings and you get to see the dark side of all that.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this show has a lot of cool action sequences and certainly some well-written drama. Still, it also has a lot of dry episodes where literally nothing happens except that the cactus grows. If you ca hang in there through these episodes, the story is great and enjoyable up until the final episode. I recommend it as an excellent binge watch. Breaking Bad is the greatest TV show or movie I have watched to date, and this is coming from a guy who 1) has yet to hook into any other TV show, and 2) has watched a lot of great movies.<br/><br/>The storyline, the directing, the script, the characters, the acting performances and the cinematography are just stunning.<br/><br/>The only blip is probably the second half of Season 5, which I think was too sped up compared to the first 4.5 seasons. That aside, it is still a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Thank you to everyone behind Breaking Bad for making me realise the possibilities of TV shows. It was a privilege to have watched Breaking Bad. One of the best serials i ever seen. Realistic, excellent drama. But the end can be different, in my opinion. All troubles were from Jessie Pinkman and he stay alive. I think Jessie first, who need to be killed there, not Walter. Walter was guilty only in few murders, all the rest were not good persons... At least, Creators of this work, can show us. What happens with money, which Walter leave for his family? What happens with Jessie?Anyway its been amazing work. The first episode was very good and memorable. The scenes with violence were very realistic and detailed. In the same time it was not like just a simple action movie. Inner feelings of the heroes were great, how they show their stresses,emotions. There are popular TV series which have been over-hyped. Breaking Bad is definitely not one of them.<br/><br/>Focusing on the rise and fall of Walter White, a family man and chemistry teacher turned drug dealer, Breaking Bad is the perfect example of excellent television that only gets better season by season as the plot thickens and intensifies, with gripping story lines and twists which are impossible to predict.<br/><br/>At times through this show you will be shocked by the lengths to which these characters will go to achieve what they want, yet the story does not get unbelievable, as you are taken in to everything that happens and the character development is incredible.<br/><br/>The charcacters in this show are complex and compelling, and throughout the seasons your opinions of them are sure to be constantly changing. Bryan Cranston is at his best as Walter White, and his dynamic with Aaron Paul's Jesse Pinkman is one of the most interesting aspects of the show. Saul Goodman (who stars in spin off Better Call Saul) is entertaining as the shady lawyer here, and Gus Fring is a thrilling villain who is more terrifying the more his character is developed.<br/><br/>As I mentioned earlier, this show only gets better as it goes along, and by the fifth and final season you will not be able to stop watching. Breaking Bad is very dark at times, and the violence and drug use make it quite a mature show, but if that doesn't put you off then you are sure to be thrilled by the complexity and genius of the story.<br/><br/>So don't miss out, and see for yourself why Breaking Bad is popular with critics and fans alike. I finished watching breaking bad a few days ago and i can't stop thinking about how great it was. One of the many things i liked about this show was the character development, i really got into the main ones. Other factors making the show the best: The acting, the length of it, right amount of surprises and the final scene. There couldn't be a better ending in my opinion. <br/><br/>This site won't allow me to submit this review unless it contains at least 10 rows... wait a minute, i just realized that i've fulfilled that demand now... Wait another minute, it said 10 rows of text! Okey i recommend this TV show to everyone from the age of 12-99. There! The title sums up my review. Truly, a masterpiece of craftsmanship and proof that television is worth watching. I am (very) late to the game and finally joined Netflix to see what all the hype was about. While the premise didn't exactly appeal to me (female, professional, in my 40s) watching "Breaking Bad" was an eye-opener. Walter White is the ultimate everyman (everywoman)--a mild-mannered, unassertive individual who lacks a sense of opportunism and aggressiveness that has left him--a formerly brilliant scientific researcher who contributed to Nobel-quality research--with a mediocre job teaching at a public high school with barely enough money to pay the bills and to support his pregnant wife, disabled son, and soon-to-be-born daughter. He is also diagnosed with terminal cancer on top of that. Although he turns to manufacturing meth out of desperation, he slowly metamorphoses into a ruthless drug kingpin. It's the kind of life ordinary people fantasize about but don't have the conjones or brains to do. This series is a rollicking good time and I expect my life to be put on hold for about another month or two until I finish watching.<br/><br/>Having a master's in a scientific discipline makes me also more hyperaware than your average film/TV show critic about scientific accuracy. I don't like it when a drama or film plays on the public's ignorance and Breaking is also somewhat guilt of this and I deducted a star for this. While fiction is permitted creative license (the Star Wars Death Star), a drama about making crystal meth and playing around with chemistry is not. Hydrofluoric acid cannot eat through a bathtub and thick wood floors or turn a human body into goo (try sulfuric acid, which is what they should have used). Fulminated mercury is extremely volatile and explosive (good job presenting this). A seasoned high-level drug distributor with an army of vicious thugs cannot be overwhelmed easily by a Jesse Pinkman; a Tuco in real life knows that someone can grab the gun he's stuck into the back of his pants and shoot him with it. This is police training 101. It is highly improbably that Jesse could have overtaken Tuco like that in the scene in Mexico.<br/><br/>For some reason Walt's character becomes a little bipolar in season 5. By season 5 he has become a malignant narcissist who believes in killing anyone who gets in his way. A few episodes later after he decides to quit making meth he starts acting more like the old, mild-mannered Walter White, at one point even telling Skylar to keep the money for herself and the kids after he dies of cancer. I'm no expert on human psychology but wasn't he a scary, menacing man a few episodes earlier who was completely oblivious to the feelings and needs of others and suddenly he is Mr. Rogers again? I think the writers need to read some more Freud or Dostoyevsky, yo. Breaking Bad The TV series "Breaking Bad", created by Vince Gilligan, is about the chemistry teacher Walter White (Bryan Cranston) who contracted cancer. Knowing that he would leave his wife and his children behind with a huge mountain of debts, he decided to get on the business of meth cooking. Together with his partner Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), they get into lots of trouble that come to a head when Walter's brother-in-law, the DEA-agent Hank Schrader (Dean Norris), finds out their second identity. I usually prefer other types of series like HIMYM and others. But when I started with the first episode, it immediately attracted me in a way that I always had to watch the following episode. It might seems that there are some repetitive moments, but it's still great to see how they solve all these problems and how much expression the actors can bring into all the different scenes. This was my first English show and i totally loved it i am writing this because i really appreciate it. All i want to do is to give huge round of applause."Breaking Bad" is the best television show. Ever. This show has been masterfully put together with layer upon layer of insight into some of the most interesting characters ever realized in the history of television. We have some very dark characters, and a lot of Grey characters, and it all adds up to brilliant dialogue and plot lines. Get on your couch now and start watching "Breaking Bad" from the very beginning, and don't miss a single scene.I probably haven't been hooked to a TV show like I am to Breaking Bad before When I started watching the show I was excited to see Hal from Malcolm in the Middle (Bryan Cranston), as Malcolm is still my favorite comedy series. It never bores me to re-watch and that is something that makes a show amazing for me. On the other hand, I simply cannot re-watch again Breaking Bad, I can with a friend, but not alone. It's not that it's anything close to bad of whatever, it just has that strange effect of awesomeness that I cannot even begin to explain. IF I could wish to forget something, I would wish to forget Breaking Bad so that I can watch it all over again. In the beginning I did not understand whether it was a drama, comedy, thriller and by the end I still cannot determine. There are moments of everything, but in general it is just plain genius. I'm not gonna repeat the synopsis, but let me just say that once you start watching it and I'm not saying watching only 1st and 2nd episode, but give it several more you'll understand how unique is this show from every other you've seen. I guess one way to describe it is that it is now far from really and what really can happen. There also other just fantastic shows but not a lot can have everything perfect, the ending being the toughest part probably. Breaking Bad nails it brilliantly here as well. It was sad to know that this amazing show is ending, but it is sadder to see a great show just being ruined by prolonging it unnecessarily. The end of this one though, completes the whole package in an astonishing way.<br/><br/>One last word for the casting - Bryan, Aaron, Anna, Dean, Bob all play phenomenal job, it was like they were born for these roles and none else. If you've seen Malcolm in the Middle, you have a great treat to see the difference in Bryan's roles and how he plays them. When I first read about this series being called the the greatest in the history of television I was skeptical about such a superlative. But it turned out to be completely right. This series is so good that it will change the way you feel about television - everything else pales by comparison. Watch every single episode of this series.<br/><br/>The story is so cleverly constructed and well written yet not confusing - it sets new standards in writing. There are no wasted scenes so you can pay close attention to every scene. Things come together in unexpected yet plausible ways. The dramatic parts are more dramatic and emotionally draining than anything on television before. The dangerous parts are tenser than any action movie. And throughout the series there is a lot of comedy from the blackest of black comedy, to laugh out loud quirks of the various characters from Jesse to Saul to Lydia. The characters are so rounded that the viewer can feel for most of them whether hero or villain. Vince Gilligan and his writing team created a masterpiece.<br/><br/>The acting is superb all round. Bryan Cranston as Walter White is so believable and sympathetic he made one get completely on the side of a devoted husband and father turned criminal mastermind. He deserves his multiple Emmy awards. Equally perfect is Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman. He gives such intense and moving performances that his character is universally loved no matter how idiotic. You can feel his pain so clearly. RJ Mitte as the teenage son afflicted with cerebral palsy is very touching and heart rending at times. Anna Gunn plays a difficult character well. I know many hate Skyler for the kind of wife she is but Anna plays her superbly. Betsy Brandt is just as terrific as her sister Marie. Dean Norris as Hank the DEA agent shows vulnerability, heroism and tenacity that made his character very real. Supporting villains played by Giancarlo Esposito as the chilling Gus and the uptight Lydia played by Laura Fraser are all excellent. Bob Odenkirk is laugh out loud hilarious as Saul Goodman the sleaziest lawyer on TV. Jonathan Banks as Mike the fixer is just perfect too.<br/><br/>Who would think that a story about a dying teacher making crystal meth to provide for his family in New Mexico would be the basis for what truly is the greatest television series ever made. How can a TV show make u hooked like this, like you had a dope :). Excellent!!!Stunning!!!spectacular!!!its a master piece.Great Story elevated to a new level by Bryan Cranston. what an actor!!! Now started watching anything with his name on it. He was a hero, comedian, villain everything in this show. All in one.<br/><br/>Great story line,you cannot predict whats next. Each and every episode from first to last is well connected. No unnecessary characters or scenes. Watch the first few episodes then you cannot stop watching it.Few scenes i really liked that i watched it over and over again. the one where he buys a new car, he asks the drug dealer to say his name and every scene in the finale.WOW!!!! i can go on and on about this. This will always stay my favorite and never i think anything can beat this. Great Show!!! I started watching Breaking Bad when it was quite unknown (in Germany), basically because I finished up another series and looked for a new one to kill some spare time so I was rater impartial and picked it because I enjoyed Brian Cranstons performance in "Malcom in the Middle".<br/><br/>But while Breaking Bad became more and more popular through media, I was astonished, that unexpectedly many people started watching this series - which seems rather usual - but in Germany it is a big deal, when a Series, which does not run on TV, nor is available in German language, breaks through to the crowd of people, that are not really interested into movies or series, but only watch stuff that is easy to understand and does not require any previous knowledge on character or story. For example Game of Thrones or The Sopranos, are only known by a "few" people that are interested in good series in general, but not by the ones that like so sit on the sofa an just simply consume what is on the screen at that particular moment.<br/><br/>So I asked myself why Breaking Bad attracted so much general interest, while e.g. Game of Thrones did not. Is it the topic, so the the whole drug business thing? Is it the characters that matter? Or was it just a kind of "happy accident", that especially this series became so popular? Without a doubt, the writing and the screenplay and just that whole series as such is one of the best ones ever made! But I like to imagine, that people tend to oversee things and in this case those "things" are other brilliant series. Being said, that Breaking Bad was the first real drama series that made its way to public audience, it is self-evident that people are blinded by the light of a really good series. Of course the most of the people, that saw Breaking Bad, mentioned it as "the best series ever made", but I say that this is the only thing the most people are capable of saying.<br/><br/>What I mean is, that everyone loves Breaking Bad, because there were simply no other series to compare with. If you for the first time eat at a fast food restaurant, it is only natural to say, that "this was the best burger ever!", but to determine if it really was the "best burger ever" you will have to eat several burgers at several restaurants. <br/><br/>My personal problem is, that you can not claim something for "the best thing ever" if you have never seen something like it. I am clearly not willing to say, that you have to know everything about a thing to enjoy it, but the hole swarm of people that glorifies Breaking Bad so badly that you as a big fan start to question the whole series really grinds my gears.<br/><br/>So all in all it is a incredible masterwork and worth admiring, but you should - as always - think twice. This is obvious one of the best written, acted and directed TV shows i've seen in the last years! With Bryan Cranston playing on the one hand side a good, gentle, warm house father and on the other hand a genius and by sometimes wacko drug-lord, which makes it a really exciting and addictive story!<br/><br/>I've watched the last episode some weeks ago, and the first days after it was like I was missing something, and even though there are a lot of good TV shows, this one tips it all. From the first episode off till the last it takes you by the arm and takes you on a roller-coaster trip true meth land! <br/><br/>But there are some points you have to know, the first season takes off pretty slow, with a briefly good introduction from all characters and who they really are. Until the point Walter discovers his decease and meets up with his former student Jesse, which you can see as a good kid in the wrong business. From that moment the vibe has been set and the ride is getting on slowly. <br/><br/>My conclusion is, that this is probably the best TV show of this century. With a lot of great acting, a lot of superb one liners, and a never to forget character: Heisenberg! This Show ...... i heard about it circa 2 Months ago and everyone told me i should watch this. Well I'm so Happy that i did :D Breaking bad Is by far the best TV-Series in storytelling,Drama lets say everything. The 1st Season was a bit boring, but starting the 2nd Season it got every episode i watched better. The Story is about a family man and chemistry teacher called Walter White. One Day he finds out that he has i think Lung cancer, and that he will die and he needs a treatment. The big Problem is that Mr. White doesn't have the Money to pay for it. So he asks his former Student Jesse if he would cock meth with him. His Objective is to make money to care for his family and pay for his lung cancer treatment. As the Seasons go on Walter gets more ruthless and to a giant criminal mastermind ( he always has a plan). He goes on to build a big Drug Empire. In Season 5 we see this whole Empire breakdown as Walts brother in-law, a DEA agent called Hank finds out that he is the man who he has been searching for so long. I really fell in Love with this show and it's very hard to let it go. The good thing is i never had to wait 1 week or more to know how the Story continues. So people go and watch this series it's a piece of TV show history that will never die. you will not regret this<br/><br/>Breaking Bad 10 out of 10 breaking bad was the best series, i mean i have never seen something like that how one man could change his mind just for let his family comfortable in a economic way. he always was closer to be trapped but the lucky was by he side.<br/><br/>In general terms, the history was very understandable, i believe everything, the actors and the actresses acting very well. when i refer to the places and the crew they are very organized.<br/><br/>at last, i like everything about braking bad so i invited you to enjoy this series i swear it wont let you disappointed.<br/><br/>Edwin Ramirez Class001 ipc-English student. This may include spoilers. <br/><br/>Many people would consider a television series just a television series. But this one can also be a cultural reflection: why not to compare it to a trip to the cinema or the theater? Not wanting to disrespect to any of these art forms but I think this has much more potential than just entertainment.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad ended on the first of October and I would like to talk about all 62 episodes in general also as a kind of homage .<br/><br/>It tells us about a professor of chemistry that despite his vast knowledge and capabilities decided to teach in a public school . During several years teaching , he had to get two jobs to support his family and for the worst of their sins it was discovered lung cancer . The odds of survival are not many and sustain a child with cerebral palsy and a baby daughter on the way is not easy . So his family meets a former student and begin producing and selling methamphetamine .<br/><br/>Basically this is the main story and of course will have its share of entertainment with (excellent)violence scenes and bad language to the mix but it is still a piece of art . Amazing Cinematography by the way. Not all of us can make the audience connect to a character so charismatic and intense that despite killing , torture and destroying people we continue to root for it until the end. Walter and Jesse two fantastic characters that make us think differently about a criminal and the reasons that lead them to act. Breaking Bad changes our way of thinking but it does not mean that we do not hold the screen or sometimes even make our hearts beating faster.<br/><br/>It made me wonder how bad people just like corrupts , thieves , murderers , drug dealers and so on may become "the bad guy". Can we be who caused this situation? And to what extent we ourselves are similar to them in their actions ? Was it because they didn't had our luck ? In a way these actions are justified because happiness should be something to everyone and not privileged .<br/><br/>And besides all this, made ​​me realize why Walter had done it for him and not for his family or money . In his words "It made ​​me feel alive" , is not that what most of us hopes in our lives? After all this is a love story between Walter and the his meth, how pride swallow him. We do not need to be happy and do illegalities like Walter but we must do what is within our reach to feel a bit more alive. What makes us feel alive is what defines us and may even be a book that makes us feel alive, it doesn't need to be an experiment with a lot of adrenaline and excitement. But why is it worth to be so rich when nothing interests us , nothing pleases us ... we are not happy.<br/><br/>But believe in one thing: this series can make us chase dreams that we would have not invested or may just be time well spent but it makes us realize that it is not necessary to be born in a slum to be a criminal. And do not say that it is something that is born with us: We can all Break Bad . Bryan Cranston...who would have known this marvelous talented actor can be such a menacing, dangerous, bad-ass that cooks meth and trying to become the most greatest kingpin of all time. He simply nails the role of Walter White from being a scared man who then transforms into the all mighty Heisenberg. Then we have our other characters from our wanna be gangster Jesse Pinkman, an annoying wife beautifully played by Anna Gunn, our D.E.A agent Dean Norris, and our purple loving freak Betsy Brandt. All theses people play their part wonderfully making the show exciting and not boring at all. As each season goes we get to met our baddies such as: Crazy 8, Tuco, The Mexican Twins, Gus, and Neo-Nazi brothers, including Heisenberg himself. This show will keep you on the edge wanting to know what happen next from the start. What makes this show perfectly is that everything ties in leaving no clues behind. What makes it even better is that Bryan Cranston leaves us a remarkable character who we can relate too and love till the end. This has been absolutely the best thing I have seen on T.V for years...no...EVER! From the moment I started watching it I just wanted to see more. My husband and I watched this together and would often try to guess what was gonna happen next....99% of the time we were completely wrong. I loved that. I found the characters all very interesting and great to see how they progressed given their situations at the time. It would have been nice to get some closure on some of the characters and what happened to them afterwards (Skyla and Marie mainly) but I think I will survive.<br/><br/>The downside of watching Breaking Bad is that everything else on TV now seems disappointing :( Once in awhile a show comes along so daring and original that everyone talks about it. Breaking Bad is that show. I have followed many television shows, and none of them have even come close to attempting what Breaking Bad's creator Vince Gilligan's sick, twisted, genius mind has come up with. Now that the show is over, I can't even think of another one that could fill the void that Breaking Bad has left in my heart. <br/><br/>Walter White (Bryan Cranston) works two jobs as a chemistry teacher at a high school in Albuquerque, New Mexico and at a Car Wash. Walter soon finds out that he is dying of lung cancer. With this new information, knowing his family can't survive without him, Walt schemes up a plan to cook some of the most purist meth ever, just by using basic chemistry. Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) is one of Mr. White's former students, who is now a local drug dealer. Mr. White enlist the help of Pinkman and from there Breaking Bad takes its audience on one of the most insanely twisted, brilliant and satisfying rides that I have ever experienced.<br/><br/>Bryan Cranston is no doubt the top actor on television, and one of the tops for film. Having seen Cranston's comedic skills in Malcolm in the Middle, and not really seeing him in anything else besides a Disney Channel Original Movie. Seeing him break away from all that, and have a real chance to do character work, and from the first episode of Bad you know that Cranston is going to shine, and you know you're witnessing something rare, you don't want to look away. While filming the first episode, creator Vince Gilligan had originally intended to kill off the character of Jesse Pinkman, but seeing how Aaron Paul and Bryan Cranston had a unique type of chemistry, he decided to keep Jesse in the show, and its a good thing they didn't, because its their love/hate relationship that fuels the show. This was Aaron Paul's first big gig, he had done a few commercials and supporting roles, but Paul fully created the character of Jesse Pinkman, no one else could have done it, that goes for Bryan Cranston too. You can see Paul's progress as an actor through out the seasons, expertly nailing every cry and whimper. Aaron Paul eases into his character as episodes go on, so many traumatic incidence happen to Jesse you can't help but feel bad. Aaron Paul and Bryan Cranston had the best chemistry on television.<br/><br/>Not only does Breaking Bad have the best leading cast, they also have the best supporting cast from Dean Norris playing DEA Agent Hank Schrader, Walts brother-in-law. Norris has some of the best character development ever written for a cop or federal agent in television. Then we get the crooked lawyer, Saul Goodman played by the one and only Bob Odenkirk. Odenkirk is absolutely supreme as Goodman, he adds a nice amount of funny, sleazy, awkward charm to the character. Jonathan Banks also adds his straight-faced, dull-witted appeal to Mike Ehrmantraut, that quite remarkable becomes some of the shows more memorable moments. Anna Gunn is Skyler White who I personally grew to have a love/hate relationship with. Skyler's constant complaining, and is always questioning Walt, but then again thats what wives are for. But Gunn does a fantastic job of making Mrs. White a believable character. Then for her sister Marie Schrader (Betsy Brandt), Hanks wife. Marie is probably the most annoying character in the show. Her constant nagging and thinking that she is better then everyone gets on my nerves. But there are people like that, and Betsy Brandt is perfect in that role. Did anyone else catch Marie's obsession with the color purple? RJ Mitte was also a terrific edition to the cast as Walt's son, Walter Jr. or better known as Flynn. Mitte has a slight case of cerebral palsy but its no where near the extent of what his character has. Mitte stated that he had to learn to walk with crutches and to slow down his speech pattern. All the more props to him. Just all around a brilliant and fantastic cast. <br/><br/>Vince Gilligan is a mad genius. Enough said. I am extremely jealous of Gilligan for being the skillful mastermind behind Breaking Bad. Every season gets better and better but i must say that season 2 is by far my favorite. The last few episodes of season 2 are masterfully written and executed. Everything with the destroyed pink teddy bear, haunts and inspires me. I give Breaking Bad a 10 out of 10. John Wayne once said that the hallmark of a good actor is for the audience to watch an actor and not feel that they are actually acting. The screenplay/writing was beyond clever. It was brilliant. And the top notch acting combined by all the actors made this probably the best series I have ever watched over the last 22 years with the exception of the mini series Lonesome Dove which I would call a draw. Better than Alias, better than Dexter...both of which captivated me completely. Let me just put this into perspective. One of the greatest actors of our generation, Anthony Hopkins sat down, just as I did and did a marathon viewing of the show and praised not only Bryan Cranston (as one of the greatest actors he has seen) but the whole cast as one greatest acting ensembles ever gathered. I can't believe this came out of AMC. <br/><br/>They say that there are no new ideas, that everything has already been done once or twice. No, this wasn't the same old tired series, it wasn't a recycled good show. It proves that creativity hasn't died and that repeats and remakes are no longer completely necessary laziness. It showed that fresh creativity still exists. This show sucked me in to the characters, good or bad and made me sympathize with each of them. It made me feel like a hero and a low life criminal, a victim, a cop, it made me look at each side of me and blurred the lines between right and wrong. There was no black or white. Only shades of Grey and a narrative of the main character and others going from white to dark Grey and descending into total hell . Enough to conflict my soul for a long long time. Total excellence. :) Can't believe I just checked out the Greatest Show on TV 2 weeks when it was about to end since people all over networking sites were buzzing about it and it got me curious. One lazy Wednesday afternoon, I've nothing else to do I decided to take a look. I was hooked the very first episode like no ever show had hooked me before. Knowing that the internet is a galaxy of spoilers I decided to stay away from it as I finish the whole show in week. <br/><br/>Now that it's all over it left and at the same time leaving a void in me wanting for more. I was very sad that I just enjoyed it just for a few weeks while those others who were into the show a long time had lots of fun talking about it. It made me feel that I missed the party of the decade. Up until now I still can't get over it as I browse the remnants of breaking bad discussions Let's talk for a moment about how this TV show looks - it's stunning. The blues of the New Mexico sky, the browns and tans of the desert, the lights at nighttime, and the blue of the pure meth. In an era of great TV, Breaking Bad'd stunning visuals put it ahead of the pack. Just look at the framing of the shots, the odd camera angles. There's so much to see here visually that you really shouldn't watch it on a small device, but always on a big screen TV. We know all about how great the acting and writing is, but the look is in a league of its own. Oh, and then there's Skinny Pete. And Badger. And Saul. And the Twins. And Hank. And Tuco. And so on. Here's a TV series I almost skipped, coz on paper it just didn't seem that interesting to me. I eventually I gave it a chance, and I'm sure glad I did. Although there were some quality dips during the run of the series it certainly has earned it's place as one of the most memorable series of all time. They were wise enough to create a 5 season story arc and give the characters a chance to come full circle. Maybe they've stopped at the height of their success, but it's a hell of a lot better then keep milking it season after season until it has bled dry like some other series did. Some people apparently were disappointed with the ending but I don't agree. Maybe people had such high expectations nobody was ever going to be able to match them. Following the 'bad guy' for 62 episodes was incredible fun and very addictive. If you haven't seen Breaking Bad (who hasn't?), give it a chance. You won't regret it! The series Breaking BAd is excellent. When I saw the first episode I was immediately in love :) I finished seeing the first series I was blown away ... :) Now I've seen all the episodes I am absolutely sure that is the best series made throughout history ...! Surpasses all others with distinction ... Who likes a good argument and appreciates quality stuff, with all certainty that I will find it and give note 10 to this series. It is the BEST SERIES MADE UP TO TODAY!! I hope for more shows like this in the future :)<br/><br/>The series braking Bad will be remembered in the next 100 years. 100 years from now maybe this series will still continue to be in the Top 10 on this site :)<br/><br/>If not in the top 10 is better for us because it is a sign that in 100 years have made at least 10 excellent series like this It is funny when you think back on 'Breaking Bad's early days and how they contrast with the way it is now. For its first two seasons, it was largely a cult show outside the U.S., featuring a fanbase that was passionate but not exactly huge. It was even dropped from UK TV due to poor ratings, never to be picked up again. However, around the time the third season premiered, its popularity began to rise, increasing with each subsequent season, thanks to word-of-mouth, reaching a pinnacle with the fifth season becoming the most-talked-about television series of 2013, as large numbers of people starting catching up with the show. This is undoubtedly due to the quality of the series – it is absolutely brilliant. The current success of it can be seen through three recent achievements – it entered The Guinness World Book of Records for being the best-reviewed TV show ever, the Writers Guild of America listed it as one of the great TV series ever written and it also walked away with the top prize at this year's Emmys (and chances are, may do next year as well). <br/><br/>One aspect of the series that no one can dispute is the brilliance of its cast. Thanks to Walter White, Bryan Cranston is no longer "that guy who played the dad in Malcolm in the Middle" and has deservedly won three Emmys for his role as Walt because like the show, he is fantastic, especially as he conveys his character's development from being "Mr. Chips" to "Scarface", as creator Vince Gilligan once remarked in his pitch for the series. Meanwhile, Aaron Paul is superb as Jesse, perfectly capturing a range of sides to his character, from being naive to mature to stubborn to introspective. Aside from the concept of how an ordinary man change transform into an entirely different person, at the very heart of 'Breaking Bad' is the tumultuous relationship between Walt and Jesse. It goes up and down like a roller-coaster, yet it gives the show heart even as the pair do desperate things and we, as viewers, can't helped but be deeply engaged with them, as they argue, confide, fight and of course, cook.<br/><br/>However, the other cast members are just as good as the two leads. As crime scene cleaner Mike Ehrmantraut, Jonathan Banks is outstanding (he should've won that Emmy) and Dean Norris is terrific with strong screen presence as Walt's DEA brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. While Anna Gunn and RJ Mitte are both great as Walt's wife and son, as they form a family relationship with Cranston that is never anything but realistic considering the situations he places them in, even if Gunn's character is not the most likable. Bob Odenkirk is a pleasure to watch as Walt and Jesse's metaphor-loving lawyer Saul Goodman, providing some comic relief, especially whenever his bodyguard Huell Babineaux (Lavell Crawford) is around. Special mention should be given to Giancarlo Esposito, who is mesmerising as Gus Fring, the owner of fast food chain, Los Pollos Hermanos. <br/><br/>'Breaking Bad' is one of those series where every episode leaves wanting you more, especially with a number of incredible cliffhangers that Gilligan has left viewers dangling on – without spoiling anything, the season five mid-way cliffhanger left me (and many others) desperate to find out what would happen next. It has grown progressively darker over the course of its five seasons, starting out as a black comedy before slowly (and understandably) morphing into something deeper and more serious, while still retaining moments of humour. Similarly, it has also grown increasingly good over its five seasons, being excellent at first before becoming incredible; with the recently-aired fifth season the best of the lot (some of the greatest episodes in the entire series are a few near the end). The key to this show's success is Gilligan, the very man who created it, who has written and directed a multitude of episodes and always manages to brilliantly place the characters in disastrous situations. The quality of the writing, acting and directing (with a special mention to Rian Johnson) on display here is exemplary and on a level that is rarely equalled. If you haven't seen this truly masterful series yet, then you know what you need to do and if you have seen it all, I can't imagine any reason why you wouldn't want to go back and watch it all over again. I know I will. Undoubtedly the best television show in recent history. When you invest so much of your time in a television show and share so much sympathy for the main characters it becomes hard to say goodbye. Now that Breaking Bad is over it has only hit me now, that it in fact, it is the greatest television show in history. What the cast a crew did with this brain child of Vince Gilligan is beyond extraordinary. The writing that this show produced will be well remembered and used for a reference for future television dramas. Although Walt got what he deserved in the end, he in fact went in a place he felt most a home, and perhaps most powerful, in a "chemistry" lab. He remains one of the greatest and saddest television characters to date. Bon voyage Walt. "Everybody lies" - says Gregory House. "Everybody lies" - echoes Dexter Morgan. "Everybody lies" - confirms Walter White. Following the cynical doctor and a serial killer on the top of the popularity of serial climbs charismatic chemistry teacher, who decided at age 50 to do the production of pure methamphetamine. Breaking Bad Is The Greatest Television Show of All Time. I hope this year Breaking Bad will win The Golden Globe Best Television Series - Drama and Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series - Drama (Bryan Cranston).
Anthony Hopkins, who reportedly binge-watched the entire five seasons in a recent two-week marathon. The 81-year-old Oscar winner was apparently so impressed by the series that he e-mailed a kind-hearted fan letter to Breaking Bad's inimitable lead, Bryan Cranston, which notes, "Your performance as Walter White was the best acting I have seen-ever."
Steven King calls Breaking Bad the Best Written Show on TV. Truly a fantastic show with an epic build up. It's definitively one of the best shows to exist. Everything about this show is great. The build up of each character is fantastic. Vince Gilligan truly made a work of art. It's a show that everyone should experience. It has everything you could possibly want from a show. It has it's funny moments, it has drama and the epic violent moments that keep you watching. Every detail in the show is important and all the cliffhangers are totally worth it. The acting is fantastic and the plot is great. You really get to know and feel for the characters. Everyone did a fantastic job on this show and I'm definitely glad that I got to experience such a brilliant show. What a magnificent series. Powerless anti-hero fighting against society and his terminal disease. Professing that everything he does is for his family but secretly,selfishly wants and requires all the hurt and suffering he inflicts on himself and others. Through the series we have seen terrible changes but still, outside of this tragedy, the world continues. Are we satisfied that the evil characters have been destroyed, do we want the anti-hero to continue in his endeavours? No and yes (in that order).I desperately wanted the Salamander brothers to continue their colourful death spree. I begged the Gods to spare Gus, Mike was the coolest bad guy ever - he should have survived.But in the BB universe the meth labs will continue, some other Walt will emerge from the ether, Jesse will mentor Brock, Skylar has Jnr and Holly. We have witnessed an Epic tale and are ultimately satisfied. I am a person who loves good movies and series and sees them as piece of art. However, I have never encountered a series which comes this close to perfection as Breaking Bad does. I have been watching it since the very beginning and unlike any other series I have watched, Breaking Bad keeps getting better. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul are both absolutely terrific and have probably given the best performances of their lives. I could go on for hours and explain why Breaking Bad is simply the best series ever created but most of it has already been said and words can not describe the experience I made with it. This is my very first review on IMDb and I am not sure if I will ever write another one. I am writing this to express my love for this series and to thank everyone involved in creating this piece of art.<br/><br/>10/10 Masterpiece... As Breaking Bad reaches it's conclusion, it leaves behind a vacuum which will be near impossible to be filled, and while this surely sound extremely cheesy, it's the absolute truth. Breaking Bad was the first and the only TV Show ever to capture my attention to the fullest, the only show to ever land me at the edge of my seat in every episode, the only show that made me actually question, what the heck is coming next? Breaking Bad was an island of originality in the midst of a sea of clichés and terribly written series. For what is worth, what this TV show did, was never done before, to show the human nature as it really is, a constant struggle in between right and wrong, there are hundreds of Walter White out there, in the real world, people that when pushed to their limits are going to push the boundaries a little bit further, and then again, to source their needs, and many will change in the process, just as like Walter showed us. The ultimate legacy of Breaking Bad is to have thrown in our faces the dark side of human existence. I am saying this to shut everyone up, For the last time, Breaking Bad Will always and i mean always be better then The Walking Dead No matter what, The Story is better, The Writer's are better, The show is better, You care about who get's killed and who doe's not get killed, it is sad, amazing, real, life, We are all saying Goodbye to the best Damn show on TV and one of the Best Show's of all time, if you have not seen it, then you are missing out on a Amazing show that will never be forgotten, If you are a fan of both show's, then that is great but do not say The Walking Dead is better, when you have never gave Breaking Bad a Chance, Goodbye to the Best Show on TV, I Am gonna miss this show, Breaking Bad was a work of art, a Masterpiece, and what a Amazing way to go out as one of the Best Show's of all time, Loved it all, My favorite show of all time, Great End to a Phenomenal show, Breaking Bad was just Awesome!!! #GoodbyeBreakingBad This is my first review.<br/><br/>I have been waiting for something as big as Breaking Bad to write it.<br/><br/>This show is the best I have seen. The way Vince Gilligan plays with us, making us create theories about how next episode will be, shows that it really gets you hooked. Almost every episode leaves you wanting more. <br/><br/>I really like how this series use psychology and chemistry in a very amusing way, making you sometimes feel awkward or bad for the characters, that, by the way, are perfectly worked.<br/><br/>Today this series ended with Felina, that is the most satisfying ending the show could had. I certainly couldn't describe to anybody what Breaking Bad has meant to me. This show has made me laugh, made me cry, made me afraid, like no other show ever has. This is absolutely AMC's finest work. Now that it's over, I have got no clue what show I'll go to next.<br/><br/>I've got a ton of options: American Horror Story, Hell on Wheels, Dexter, Under The Dome, True Blood, The Bridge, The Killing, or Sons of Anarchy. I'm currently watching AMC's The Walking Dead, Low Winter Sun, and HBO's Game of Thrones. But I feel like I'm just replacing Breaking Bad, which is almost impossible. <br/><br/>The only reason I even watched this show was because season 3 of The Walking Dead had just ended. I needed another show to hold me off until season 4. I skimmed through Netflix and stumbled upon Breaking Bad, which got really great reviews. As it turns out, I liked Breaking Bad just a bit more than Walking Dead.<br/><br/>I watched season 1 just to see how it was. I loved it, so I watched season 2. I kept watching and watching and watching. I realized I was addicted/hooked when I watched all of season 3 in one day. <br/><br/>When season 5B started, I watched it every Sunday night. And now it's over. I have decided that Breaking Bad is the best show I've ever seen in my life. The final episode of the series was so gripping, so dramatic, almost painful to watch.<br/><br/>I truly recommend Breaking Bad to everybody who enjoys a good TV show. So, I am writing a no spoiler review for the show, AFTER THE FINALE AIRED. There are a few shows I could consider perfect, well, currently only two....the Sopranos and Breaking Bad. OK in no way am I trying to compare the two, except they both exceed my expectations. Before watching Breaking Bad, there is two things you should know, 1) The description "A chemistry teacher who makes meth." is not what the show is about, that is just the first episode character development plays a huge role, 2)the entire series takes place in about a two year period of time (ruling out some rare flashbacks), basically seasons 1-someof 5 are in one year and sometime in 5-finale have bigger time gaps.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad is a marvelous show, it has dark humor and very dark events, so there are some shocking scenes. It just kept getting better and better is a great summary for the show, because when events happen in Breaking Bad, it is shocking, the violence isn't overused and the writing is phenomenal, the thing about this show is that no one is really off limits, anything can happen to anyone at anytime.<br/><br/>Another thing that makes this show great is that tension builds, and when things fall apart you can only watch in horror and shock. The story follows Walter H. White, a father, a husband, a person who doesn't take charity. He earns his money, he has to earn it, for his family......speaking of family, Walt has a brother-in-law in the DEA, I understand that the double life thing seems a little overplayed, but it really works great here.<br/><br/>The cast is perfect, Hank, Walt's brother-in-law really reminded me of someone I know in real life, he is funny, sometimes racist, but he has a place in his heart for family. Then there is Skylar, she is Walt's wife and Anna Gunn does a fantastic job playing her, then there is Jesse, but you'll have to watch the show.<br/><br/>From the hooking beginning to the final episode (which was glorious) Breaking Bad just keeps getting better and better, though I am sad it ended, it was a great run. Breaking Bad can tear you apart with a gunshot, and also with a phone call. It can air an episode full of one jaw-dropping action scene after another... and then it can turn around and make you gasp through the sheer quietness of a remote cabin. This series has been a character study in one individual, famously going from Mr. Chips to Scarface, but having seen Walt at both those extremes. You Have to see this series before you die. if you wonder humph what after Breaking Bad well i suggest Oz,The Wire,Got,and Suits. but non of those series can get a "Heisenberg" level I apology my bad speech but hey i dnt give a sht Have A1 day. I've been watching Breaking Bad ever since AMCTV announced the beginning season in 2008. I was intrigued by the plot line. Once I viewed Episode 1 of Season 1, I was hooked.<br/><br/>First, I can't praise Breaking Bad enough. Everything about the series is absolutely tops. The script (hats off to Vince Gilligan) delivers a consistently high quality, and suspenseful, drama episode after episode and season after season that keeps us viewers on the edge of our seats. The acting is phenomenal. Almost all the actors were unknowns to me. And yet every one of them came across as totally believable as human beings in every scene where they occurred. Every one of them delivered a spot-on performance and I mean even the minor characters like Jesse's buddies, Skinny Pete and Badger. No weak acting in any scene. And the direction and cinematography were outstanding. Anyone who understands films knows all these elements―script, actors, director, cinematography―all play a vital role in making a great movie. And they're all there in Breaking Bad, and I might add, all consistently there season after season. Especially the script and the acting.<br/><br/>As an aside, Hollywood badly needs to take a lesson from Breaking Bad. More and more of the movies coming out of Hollywood rely heavily on an exorbitantly paid movie actor to pull the crowd, CGI, blasting loud music, and shoot-'em-up / blow-'em-up scenes. Watching the trailers of such movies, I find myself wondering how many automobiles suffered a horrific death to make the movie.<br/><br/>From the beginning in Season 1 we've watched the principal character, Walter (aka Walt) White, start out as a dedicated family man and high school chemistry teacher in Albuquerque, New Mexico. One day while working at his car-wash job, he passes out. At the doctor's he discovers he has intractable cancer. He's a decent man, mild-mannered, and dumped on by many people, including the Romanian-American owner of the car wash where he works part-time to supplement his meager teacher salary.<br/><br/>Walt's a guy who so loves his family that he really wants to leave them enough money to survive after he's gone because he doesn't make enough money teaching chemistry and working at the car wash to afford better life insurance. One day his brother-in-law, Hank Schrader, a DEA agent in Albuquerque, takes him along on a meth bust. A fatal turn in Walt's life. He notices immediately that most meth cookers aren't chemists and he knows he could do a far superior job if he set his mind to it. The beginning slide down the slippery slope.<br/><br/>While along on the bust, he sees a young man clamber out of a second story window of the adjacent house, drop to the ground, and scamper away unnoticed by the DEA agents. But not unnoticed by Walt, who recognizes him as a former student in his chemistry class and who wasn't exactly what one would call a stellar student. Enter Jesse Pinkman. And another fatal turn in Walt's life. It was Pinkman's lab that was busted by the Feds, and Walt seeks out Jesse and propositions him. Walt'll cook the meth and Jesse will run the distribution operation. Walt figures he can make enough money this way to provide for his family when he's gone. Soon he's producing an extremely high grade of crystalline methamphetamine quickly known in the trade as "blue sky." By the end of Season 1 he's been forced to murder a young man and feels very distraught about it. But of course this is another fatal turn in Walt's life and a further slide down the slippery slope. Soon bodies are falling all around him right and left. Some murdered by him personally and some murdered at his behest.<br/><br/>It's made clear in Episode 1 (summer 2013) of Breaking Bad that Walter White is still alive at season's end. He's a disheveled, worn-out, desperate man on the run. He's returned to his fenced-in, abandoned house in Albuquerque. He says hello to his former neighbor, Carole, who is so startled by him and by his appearance that she drops her load of laundry and holds her hand up to her mouth in utter shock.<br/><br/>Walter White doesn't die a physical death, at least not by the season's finale. Along the way from being the good high school teacher who wanted to provide for his family to becoming Heisenberg, the greatest meth kingpin ever, he's warped his soul more and more into an unrecognizable human being to the people who love him. In this season's Episode 2 standing directly in from of Walt but staring blankly into space Hank mumbles, "I don't even know who I'm talking to." Walter White has died spiritually. He is no longer the Walter White Hank affectionately called the brainiac. But who is he? <br/><br/>He's a man who's traversed one end of the spectrum of good and evil to the other end. In this season's Episode 3 we hear Jesse Pinkman's voice-over warning us: "Mr. White, he's the devil." But no human being, no matter how evil they've become, is completely evil. They still preserve a residue of their humanity. A tiny glowing ember of what's left of their soul. They can still feel emotional pain. They can still love their family and long for them. They can still show compassion. And that in the end is what makes human beings so unique. We can never venture totally beyond good and evil. The Old Testament expresses it well: Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil. Genesis Chapter 3:22. But it's not enough to know good and evil. We are bound morally to use this knowledge to prevent our desires from driving us to utter destruction. For our own sake, for the sake of our loved ones, and for the sake of humanity. As brilliant as Walter White was, he failed to grasp this crucial moral imperative. Breaking bad is a series that contain violence, drama as well as action, witch make it the best series ever. I can't begin to describe why i like breaking bad. It is just when you have seen a couple of episodes you are hooked! In my opinion the acting is magnificent and the music Vince has picked is really really good to. Breaking bad can be a little weird and slow sometimes but you don't mind because it's awesome anyway. I know this review probably sucks I just wanted to share my love for the series. I have to say that everyone should watch this the minute they get the chance. That's all i have to say about breaking bad for now, just watch it because it is worth it I promise! Vince Gilligan has created the best written, best acted, and most beautiful visually T.V. show on the planet. Walter White, has an unbelievably remarkable story arc executed perfectly. This is the same for each and every character on the show. The quality of the cinematography is spectacular and has not been matched by a show to date. A perfect example is the scene after the bomb has gone off in the nursing home. Gus walks out of the hospital room and adjusts his tie out of habit, then the camera changes perfectly exhibiting the true skill of everyone on the show. There is no show better than Breaking Bad and I doubt a show will reach the quality for a long time. Completely by coincidence I began watching Breaking Bad, one of my friends posted a random facebook status, where he mentioned how he thought Breaking Bad was "king and season 5 was awesome" <br/><br/>I knew that the show existed because I continuously saw Bryan Cranston's very intense face on Netflix, but I never took further notice of it, and just went on seeing some other show. But after I saw that post on my timeline, I just gave the show a chance and decided to see the Pilot, which was the least I could do. And man, was that a turning point, I mean outstandingly amazing Pilot, that just captures and overwhelms you. <br/><br/>A couple of minutes ago I finished all seasons and 1st half of season 5 which will be the last season. I am literally anxious to see the second 2nd half. Breaking Bad is the most intense, exciting, breathtaking, well-acted/directed TV-show I've ever seen, like really ever. In the beginning, after I read the plot, I was a little unsure on how they were going to make this show anything but average. But they most certainly could. <br/><br/>I never heard of Bryan Cranston before Breaking Bad, I later found out that I saw him briefly in 'Argo' but that was it. So I didn't know what I could expect acting wise, I guess I wasn't that quick to appreciate his significant performance throughout the first season, because well, I don't know. But somewhere a long the road of season two, I just became more or less speechless of his stunning talent and so terribly convincing acting. The way Walter White changes through the series made me reflect back on season one where I found him so innocent, and thinking this thing with cooking will pass sometime soon, but of course it didn't Bryan Cranston breaths new life into everything he touch as being Walter White, and this character just gives me a roller- coaster ride. I went from thinking he was innocent and trying to help out his family, to completely have nothing left for him and I have like zero sympathy for him anymore. He is manipulating everything around him, I mean everything, but my mind is really torn on how I want this show to end, I don't really have an opinion, like I believe Vince Gilligan has the best ending in his sleeve ready for us.<br/><br/>Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman, was just amazing. I think Aaron Paul is really, really talented and the chemistry between him and Cranston is unquestionably the best I have seen for a while. I loved the character of Jesse from second one, he gives the show the humorous side of it, and his waterfall of talking and phrases is just brilliant. He begins the show like a bit of a around-on- the-floor-type-of-guy, but I mean that he changes into something that he can be proud of, I mean the man got his challenges, who doesn't? But he is the human of the show, or at least he develops into. He is the character who cries the most, I mean red-eyed, tear dropping crying, and who is like affected about all the craziness that is going on: The numerous victims and sacrifices and the feeling of almost getting caught, and always have to get something out of the way, or constantly fighting for your life. His focus goes from being wealthy to not really care about being rich at all, like he has realized what stuff that – indeed - means something. I am really glad, that he didn't get cut off the show. I mean where would it have been without Jesse Pinkman and Aaron Pauls tremendous portrayal of him. <br/><br/>This is so well-written, and so credible story that just keeps getting stronger season for season. Which I believe is very unique, how many times have I not been sitting back watching a really good series fall apart because it keeps going on for no reason? This does not fall apart. It only gets better, stronger, more intense and more exciting through all seasons. This story could be, it actually could be realistic in some aspects, and this just shows how a life really can hit a turning point that changes you and your surroundings forever, and that is realistic.<br/><br/>The cast, the entire cast is incredible, and the writers, directors, everyone involved in this project have created a legend in form of Walter White, and not to mention that they have created one of the best show the world has seen (according to me of course) I have to mention Aaron Paul again, because he is also a very big reason for this show success. He is just unbelievable good.<br/><br/>I'm excitingly waiting for the last 8 episodes. I'm sad that I have to say goodbye to Jesse and Walter but I guess its for the best. Vince Gilligan has made a masterpiece, that I guarantee will be remembered, and every single award this show has received, every piece of critical acclaim it has received, has been very much deserved. <br/><br/>Yo, now there's nothing left but to wait I have seen all the episodes to this series except the finale which is coming out next week and i can't wait to see what will finally happen. How will this all end? This show is pure genius and the writing is magnificent i think it is safe to say that Breaking Bad is the greatest TV show of all time PERIOD. I have seen legendary shows like The Wire and The Sopranos but none can be compared to Breaking Bad, the acting is top notch. So for the people that have not seen the show and for the future generation that are going to go to IMDb to read the reviews before seeing it i have only one thing to say: Do you want a Epic series this is it. Pure quality from season 1-5. Breaking Bad is a work of art. It is always going somewhere. It seems that from the beginning they planned it to be five seasons long because everything falls into place and everything is pointing towards an inevitable ending.<br/><br/>Every character in the show is fantastic. The worst ones (as in antagonistic) are filled with redeeming qualities, and also the protagonists are filled with flaws. They all change throughout the series and this is also something that makes it worth watching. This makes your allegiance towards them change, and having such a strong arch makes even some of the secondary characters as complex as some of the best you've seen on film.<br/><br/>It has a tendency to always go in the direction you never expected, but this always works better for the story and it fits into place with more grace than you've ever imagined.<br/><br/>It took me a while to start watching it because going through a TV series is like starting a relationship. You're going to be seeing this for a good amount of time and it is worth thinking before jumping into it, but believe me this is it. It's the pinnacle of the golden age of television. Enjoy every second. I just wish I could watch it for the first time again and know nothing of what's going to happen. "Vince Gilligan's" show Breaking Bad at first seemed far fetched, a high school chemistry teacher who begins cooking meth once he gets lung cancer. However, through jaw dropping plot twists, his enticing character development, unique story layout, and special effects he gets viewers to keep asking for more. The basis of the show is about Walter White, a chemistry teacher who is having a hard time working two jobs, dealing with a disabled son with another baby on the way, and has lung cancer. With the whole world seemingly crashing down on him you watch this once, regular father "Break Bad", and become evil in order to in his eyes "help his family."<br/><br/>The layout of the show is very unique, and is one of the ways Vince Gilligan is able to keep his viewers guessing. Throughout the show there are series of flash forwards where you will see a glimpse of the future scenes. This technique is perfectly executed, and makes viewers try to piece together what is going to happen in the show. Although at the same time it does not spoil anything or allow viewers to know the future. An example of this technique being used is displayed right in the beginning of the first episode, where it shows the main character getting into a car accident in the middle of the desert with people lying dead in his van. The scene instantly grabs the viewers attention, and once they are brought back in time before the scene they want to watch to see how the show will get back to that scene. Another enjoyable feature to the show is that the past of the show is very important to know, and is referred to constantly. Though this may not seem like a big deal there are many shows that try and allow new watchers be able to pick up quickly. In Breaking Bad they make all of the time on the show important, and is not just filler so you need to watch from the beginning.<br/><br/>In television shows the plot does not always hold a great significance though in Breaking Bad it is the backbone to why most people continue to watch. Vince Gilligan, and the other producers make sure by the end of each episode you are wanting more, and just waiting for next the next episode to air. Every episode seems to have a new twist, and a new reason to keep watching, although at the same time the storyline still adds up, and does not become bizarre or make you lose interest. In Breaking Bad, Vince Gilligan is not afraid to kill of important characters which always leaves you in suspense as to what will happen next. <br/><br/>Characters on a television show are the main part to a show, and if you can't get your viewers to enjoy watching them then your show will fail. On Breaking Bad lead actor Bryan Cranston "Walter White", and partner in crime Aaron Paul "Jesse Pinkman" are great together. Watching these two go through this roller coaster of a show is just fun to watch. This has led to both of these actors into well deservingly winning, and being nominated for multiple Emmys. Breaking Bad takes advantage of all of its air time, and really develops all of its characters so you are able to relate to each one. Even though by the end of the show there are plenty of characters, each one has their own personality, and you really get to know everyone. This is another way Breaking Bad is able to create so many dramatic scenes because even if something happens to a side character it is still very important.<br/><br/>Special effects are a normal in movies, and shows in this time period which can add an extra depth, to the experience of watching the film. Although in many action filled movies or shows they become overused, and end up dumbing down a film. In Breaking Bad there are an appropriate amount of "special effect" filled scenes which adds another wow factor to the show. An example, was when Walter White, went to a drug dealers hide out an in order to seek revenge for his partner, ended up blowing up the building which really ended the season in a "bang". <br/><br/>Breaking Bad is a drama, thriller which is not intended to carry out pedagogic purpose although when reflecting on the show it does carry out a strong message. Seeing Walter White the main character fight so hard to provide a good life for his family. Then see his life change even more for the worst once he goes down a bad path shows that doing any similar illegal activities is never worth it. Also throughout the series it depicts pretty realistic scenarios of what peoples life are like that are druggies. A memorable example from the show was when Walter was looking to find his partner "Jesse" and he walked through a meth house. Seeing all of the people just strung out on drugs did not really give off a good message of what it is like to meth or any similar drugs. <br/><br/>Watching Breaking Bad has been quite an experience watching, and in a few weeks the show will be over at its fifth season. If you are interested in a show that will attach you, and at the same time constantly leave you hanging, not knowing what to expect, then Breaking Bad is for you. The acting in this series will have you thinking that everyone in the show Is real, and you are just watching the best reality television show ever. Vince Gilligan will now always have a problem when releasing any future work, as it will be compared to Breaking Bad, which seems impossible to match. I love breaking bad, its a very great show showing us how life can transform a good person and turn him into a villain. When Walter had just entered the meth business all he wanted was to get enough money to take care of his family after he dies, but as the show goes on we see him transform into a greedy person who wants more money and power and will stop at nothing until he gets what he wants. At certain points when every one wants to get out of the criminal life and go back to living normally for example when Jesse and Mike decided to leave, Walter tries to convince Jesse to keep on working with him even after he has made enough money to support his family. All this just shows us how greedy Walter is for power. According to me i think he has gone too far and it is too late to go back to having a normal life with his family and i probably think the show might not in his favor So I haven't seen shows like The Sopranos or MASH or others that are highly rated. But I have seen a lot, and out of what I have seen this show takes the cake, and by a lot. Nearly every aspect of episode, from the story to the acting to the sound and then directing and cinematography are top notch. I personally can't re-watch a TV series without getting bored really quick (2 episodes into Lost I was done), but I've seen this series 4 times already and am excited for just about every episode (peek a boo kills me, I skip through a lot of that episode) and will do so again when I have the final episodes in hand.<br/><br/>I think that if you have any excuse at all to start a series from scratch, this is the one for you. The thespian abilities of all actors are excellent. Unpredictable happenings, always genius solutions for key scenes. I'm infected. First TV Show that manages it to force the audience to sympathize with the good and the bad guys but bizarrely these characters are mixed up what is extremely exciting. Aaron Paul seems to fit perfectly into his character.<br/><br/>It's not mainly about the topic drugs it's mainly about people coping with unusual situations caused by unusual happenings at first. The golden thread that is created throughout the show is genius. Bryan Cranston showed already in Malcom in the Middle that he's mutable. His "Heisenberg" is so convincing! Thanks! Looking forward for the next time: "Previously on AMCs breaking bad...." :)))) Near the very end of this TV show, it is not hard to conclude that this is for sure the best crime drama series ever made for TV. There is however few more, but as a real life drama it is the best. Other memorable and legendary TV shows is for sure "The Sopranos", but it is more oriented on fictional mafia style. The storyline of Breaking Bad which is very unpredictable, yet follows very clear path of ordinary man entering dark side of the crime, and the consequences that comes with it feels real and unusual for TV show. The photography of the sceneries, the time lapse in scenes are unique, as well is more than few times camera work in unusual way. The score tempo and sound of it brings tense and is in the great rhythm with the plot, all the way through series (especially season 4). Soundtrack here is less important, but the rhythm of the scores, which is unbeatable is creepy and unique. Everything looks more like high quality movie than TV show. Actors brings excellent acting, and are very involving. So much can be said, so much more, but in short, this is the one great TV show that is worth to have in own collection. What is interesting, the series did not fall down going through seasons, but becomes better. Fort me personally seasons 3, 4 & 5 looks the best. Making reruns is not boring but something very interesting to discover what we might miss in vast of details this series brings, and it is fun to re watch how this shy ordinary man becomes dangerous villain. My headline I wrote was probably the hardest thing I have ever wrote, Seriously. I have always considered Seinfeld my favorite TV show with no real competitors. Well I have to say Seinfeld is no longer my favorite show, Breaking Bad is. Breaking bad is amazing, from the story to the actors who play the characters everything is perfect.<br/><br/>The Storyline hits home for me. I am a recovering addict who has been sober for a year now. I also was a dealer, not a big time like these guys are. The world of drugs and dealing is a dark place, yes at times you feel great and you do make a lot of money but no matter who you are if you are in that world you will face dark times and the lifestyle WILL catch up to you and bring you into a hole darker than hell itself. Which is where Walt and Jesse currently are in the story. But when they first started there venture into the world of drugs it looked glamorous with all the money and nice stuff. The growth of Walt's character has been amazing. He's gone from the "Good guy" to the "Bad Guy" throughout the story. Jesses character has kind of gone the opposite direction, now he's questioning everything he has done and wants to get out of the drug world. The characters we have met in between have made this show one of the greatest of all time. Everyone from the Mexican Cartel Hit Men to the Cartel themselves, to the Different drug dealers, and Jesse's girlfriends, Jesse's friends, Drug lords, Cops, Jesse and Walt's Families and all the other characters in between have made this show amazing.<br/><br/>What makes a great storyline even better are the people who play the characters. Bryan Cranston is an amazing actor and has played Walt perfectly, I mean he has nailed him. Aaron Paul has played Jesse perfectly, and has become one of my favorite actors. Anna Gunn has been amazing along with Dean Norris who plays the perfect cop. They couldn't of found a better Gus than Giancarlo Esposito. I mean every single character has been nailed, which is why this show is among the greatest of all time.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this show than you are only hurting yourself. I would do anything to be someone who hasn't seen this show yet so I could re watch the greatest show of all time. Please do yourself a favor and watch this show, Every season and episode that has aired is on Netflix(first half of 5th season has just come out on Netflix). Television just does not get any better than this. Start with episode one and do not turn your head away for even a moment. Having probably heard everything that has already been said about "Breaking Bad", all I can say is it will blow your mind. The writing is to perfection, the actors and casting are right on and the suspense leaves you biting your fingernails and waiting around for the next episode in a state of shock. This storyline runs to perfection like a finely tuned engine or musical instrument and not a beat is missed. It seems selfish for the creators to be so selfish and end the series this year! Hey guys, how about, "Breaking Bad, The Movie" as a real final finale! Bring Heisenberg to the big screen! I came upon this TV series in an unusual way, a young college friend Kyle mentioned I might like it. I am a Chemist and the main character here is also a Chemist, so we make a natural connection, of sorts. But there is where the similarity ends.<br/><br/>I watched seasons 1 through 4 on Netflix streaming, often 2 or 3 consecutive episodes in a day. Then I watched the last season on AMC. It is interesting to observe how the characters' morals and values changed as the key characters got further and further into the drug business. Through most of the episodes when confronted by his wife, Walter always said he did it for his family. In the final episode we find that was not the truth, he did it because of the challenge, it made him feel alive and in control of something. He realized he was good at it.<br/><br/>Bryan Cranston is really super-good as Walter White, high school Chemistry teacher in Albuquerque, just turning 50, married with a teenage son and just finding out another is on the way. But Walter gets bad news, he has lung cancer and probably doesn't have much longer to live. He keeps it a secret at first, but also wants to leave his family in decent financial shape. Truly an honest, upright citizen up until then, his desperation gets him to dabble into the crystal meth drug trade. He is a natural, he is a Chemist, and he figures, what's the harm?<br/><br/>White gets hooked up quite by accident with Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman, a former student of his, one of those who never paid much attention in class and didn't learn much. But Jesse is connected into the crystal meth market and White needs him as a partner. Their first foray, in Jesse's beat-up mobile home in a remote hideaway in the desert doesn't turn out real well, but the relationship is sealed. Not so much by mutual admiration, but by parasitic need.<br/><br/>White eventually takes on the mythical-sounding name, "Heisenberg", and his reputation spreads. An interesting name, Heisenberg was a real scientist who is credited with the "Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle", and it is fitting because of the "uncertainty" in Walter White's life.<br/><br/>I can't say too much about both actors, Cranston and Paul. Both of them play their roles to perfection, it would be hard to imagine better picks, and their acting is mainly responsible for my interest in seeing more episodes. As well as Anna Gunn who is Skylar, Walter's wife and of course Giancarlo Esposito who comes on as Gus the local drug lord who uses his chicken restaurant as his front.<br/><br/>An interesting additional character is played by Dean Norris who happens to be White's B.I.L. Hank Schrader, a DEA agent. Of course there are wives and children, but Walter, Jesse, and Hank are the focus of the entire story line.<br/><br/>The last episode was last night, September 29th, 2013. His cancer didn't get Walt, he took a bullet as he made sure Jesse avoided getting shot. He had taken a fantastic journey. Breaking Bad is the best show I've seen since The Wire.<br/><br/>The plot, characters and situations are fantastic. <br/><br/>Bryan Cranston's portrayal of a man's descent into chaos and insanity is something I have never seen in a modern TV show.<br/><br/>The plots are carefully constructed and filled with action and tension.<br/><br/>The characters are lovingly realised and you care about every one, even the bad guys (of whom there are many). <br/><br/>The only fault with the show is that it doesn't focus on the downside of crystal meth i.e. the people who actually use the stuff. Despite this Breaking Bad is still the most watchable thing on TV at the moment.<br/><br/>Watch it! Breaking Bad, the first season is MIND BLOWING, and as you go you think it can't get any better but you are wrong. As you go on to the next seasons you start to see this character transformation in Walter White and how he gets sucked in into the world of crystal me-th. You start to see how much he cares about his business and the longer you go the darker the seasons get. Breaking bad is a MASTERFUL work of art that is brilliantly written and has a great story. This is definitely one of the best televisions drama shows that has been created and you can never go wrong with breaking bad if you want to watch a good show. Breaking bad is simply great and will blow your mind in several occasions. I truly recommend Breaking Bad for every one,and to quote Walter White "I am not afraid of danger, because I AM danger" It's not very often that I stump up a maximum for a TV Show or Movie on this site, yet every once in a while, sometimes unexpectedly you can come across something that is engrossing from start to finish. <br/><br/>It's strange to think that a programme as dark and unpredictable as Breaking Bad can bring such joy over the course of an hour, but with the truly excellent storyline and script handed to Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul ET AL by Vince Gilligan has really set the standard as to how shows like this should be done. <br/><br/>Everyone probably knows about the situation from the start of season 01, so i won't bore you with another break down of the goings on. What I personally loved right from the off was the fact that there seemed to be a finality to the series where it sets out a 'POSSIBLE' ending for the lead character; and because of this situation, the metamorphosis of Walter White from genius chemist and family man, to morally ambiguous, and threatening demeanour that he develops throughout the course of the series utterly encapsulates you when watching. <br/><br/>With that said, everyone's eyes should be following Walter's side-kick in Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), in some ways, when Walter does a nasty action, Jesse is always there to question the decisions made and acts as a sort of conscience. The development of their relationship defines the success of this programme and it is amazing to think that Aaron Paul's character was only initially slated for one series. By far and away the best decision the series made was keeping the two of them together. <br/><br/>With that, it must be said that together, Aaron Paul and Bryan Cranston are the two most talented individuals on TV today, and people should really learn from them when dealing with a dark and twisted series such as this.<br/><br/>I for one cannot begin to recommend this programme more highly to anyone looking for a consistently witty, disturbing, tear jerking and visually stunning and relentless series that has maintained the highest possible standards to delight myself and fans over the last 5 seasons. I just hope I get the chance to buy this on Blu-Ray (in the UK - none so far and it's 2012!) so that i can further appreciate the vast array of visual artistry, isolation and spot on settings to enjoy for many years to come! - Thank you Vince Gilligan for making a truly brilliant show, and I for one will be very sad when the show finally comes to an end in 2013! It was only last year that Ireland received this show on TV, pretty sad huh? Seeing as how long it's been out.<br/><br/>As somebody who doesn't watch TV, I seen the season box-sets in my local DVD store a few times, I always looked at the cases, read the synopsis but never purchased. I was sketchy I guess because I thought with Bryan Cranston (Being Hal from Malcolm in the Middle) that the show wouldn't have been as "hardcore" as it is/was stated to be.<br/><br/>One day after being in my DVD store, I finally decided to purchase Season 1, not thinking much of it I went home and turned it on. Let's just say, I sat there for 7-8 hours, the day flew by.<br/><br/>My thoughts were wrong, I was wrong, what I thought it would have been was/is not, it is superior, far more superior than any of your typical shows like "Weeds" (Which yes I know is a comedy so there really is no solid comparison) or programs like The Wire. Breaking Bad delivers what it says it does, and I'm pretty sure either Bryan Cranston is either getting paid billions to perform in this,or he really is a methamphetamine manufacturer because his acting is ABSOLUTELY brilliant in this show. It's quite possibly the best acting I've ever seen in a TV show seeing how he went from an image of "Hal" to an image of "Walter", this bad-ass dad who takes **** from nobody.<br/><br/>Jesse & Walter are quite the pair, Aaron & Bryan are quite the pair, on camera and off camera. Watching the blooper reels I can see they have a laugh and a good time. On the set they have a good time doing what they do, and I cannot even begin to describe how attached to this show they are, I sometimes even believe it's a documentary of some sort, a real life happening.<br/><br/>I am just now going on to Season 3, I look do not regret any minute I've spent watching this show and I extremely recommend it for anybody out there, this is a solid 10/10.<br/><br/>Remember folks, "Stay out of his territory". Breaking Bad documents the transition of a mild-mannered high school chemistry teacher into a ruthless and powerful drug kingpin. The show itself includes enough suspense/mystery to keep you wondering, without going overboard (e.g. unlike pretty much anything by JJ Abrams). The characters are well-written and the actors all portray them masterfully. The story itself is intricate enough to make you think, without being too cerebral/confusing.<br/><br/>Over all, it's dark, funny, sad, and compelling...sometimes all at the same time. If you enjoy something a bit grittier, that actually has some substance to it, then you'll enjoy Breaking Bad. Breaking Bad is my favorite show of all time. I am glad that I'm not alone in this belief, and it is one of the greatest misfortunes that people out there either have not seen or do not appreciate this show.<br/><br/>People often compare Breaking Bad to Weeds, because it is about a parental unit resorting to selling drugs in order to provide for his family. Except that Breaking Bad is actually realistic, truly dramatic, and doesn't start grasping at straws by the time the second season ends. The best part about the show is how organically it progresses. With other shows, transitions can seem forced, but with Breaking Bad, the entire series feels like one long season. Things that happen in Season 1 actually have meaning in Season 4. <br/><br/>It's also just incredible how engaging the series is. Everyone acts so well, and the storyline is so rich and layered you get blown away multiple times an episode. You really gotta hand it to Bryan Cranston. If you had told me ten years ago that the Dad from Malcolm in the Middle would be performing superbly as a meth dealer, I would've laughed in your face. By the end of the first episode of Breaking Bad, I already associated Cranston more with Walter than Hal.<br/><br/>Watch this show, you will not be disappointed. It's as deep and rewarding as any show can get. It's also amazing such gold would turn up on AMC rather than a premium cable network. Nothing HBO has ever produced can get close to Breaking Bad, as good as those shows are. I was late to the game... kept hearing good things but never saw it. Finally I decided to dedicate some time, but I'm not one to jump into a story mid-stream.<br/><br/>Therefore I sought out Season One, Episode One, so I could begin at the beginning. You have to do the same if in a similar situation. The genius of the series is character progression, so you can't be random in when you start watching. The evolution of the people and their interwoven stories is the core of the series.<br/><br/>After the first few episodes, I was consumed in watching every show in order, as quickly as I could. It's simply brilliant.<br/><br/>Rather than re-hash the details, all I can say is it's worth the journey. The concept is wild, some of the characters can be annoying, and a lot of people will find holes in the storyline. Here's my reply: It's smarter than everyone watching. The writers are 10 steps ahead of you. You will be challenged, shocked, confused and irritated on a number of levels.<br/><br/>And that's why it is genius. I feel i have to write this review, to many times in life writers, directors, actors and the little old camera man don't get the prise they deserve. Breaking Bad for me scores a 10 in every department. All there hard work came together in latest feast of drama, intrigue and action. A true master piece of television which will surly heat up the debate, has the modern day TV series overtaken the Movie as the most entertaining media. With the likes of Broadwalk Empire and Game of thrones, does the Movies still offer us the public quality entertainment or mismatch of special effects and poor story lines....... Breaking Bad - to me is the best TV series out there so far. That itself i still reckon is an understatement of how good this show is.<br/><br/>It is pretty obvious : This show pretty much sums up what Breaking Bad means, "turning to the darkside" - pretty much for good. I enjoyed how the Director and the script writer gives you an authentic feeling to this TV Series. At times, you can feel the characters in there, share their sentiment - provided that you have been following this series since day one.<br/><br/>Most of my mates complained that this TV series is "too slow - dramatic", at times I will admit, it is pretty dramatic - but in a good sense of the word. It puts you in the front seat, witnessing how good turns to bad, and bad becomes to worst. Breaking Bad is unique, and when I say unique, it is not your usual day to day TV series. Not your usual "big bang theory, the mentalist, how i met your mother" series. Breaking Bad for me stands out among the rest, because every episode is crafted to perfection.<br/><br/>I doubt I will be able to put in words how good Breaking Bad is, and how much I've enjoyed it. Name me a TV series that you reckon in the last 5 years is good, and I'll assure you Breaking Bad is better. In the middle of fourth season I have a need to say something about Breaking Bad. I always had my favorite TV shows and I have them today, like it is Dexter or Game of Thrones, but Breaking Bad goes on the top of everything I watched and that I am watching. I must give great regards to all of the crew of the show, as any aspect here is first class. It is rare feeling for one TV show to be that good.<br/><br/>It is hard to be objective here, but what everyone agrees is that acting, cinematography and music is on higher standards of regular TV work. During first season I found its plot not just original but so involving and with other seasons it just become an addiction for more.<br/><br/>This fourth season is magnificent in its way and when I search for awards and opinions there is nothing but thrills.<br/><br/>And I agree. Even villains here are not just likable, and officials (DEA) are perceived as opposite to that.<br/><br/>The crystal met is a very bad drug, and we all know that, but here we don't think about it that way, actually the Art of the creators of the show made lead us to feel positive for our heroes. I don't know much about drugs, I only know how met is bad, but here you have feeling that met they produce might not be so harmful? Never mind it is only show.<br/><br/>I think that there are many moral issues here, and how they vague family life with criminal activity is masterfully. The whole positive thinking about it (Mr. White character) is that he did that because of caring of his family, as he is not negative person. And character Jesse is simply adorable, even in the criminal context, yet rightful and with high moral in itself.<br/><br/>I am happy that there will be one season more. This show simply deserves to be put in the film library as a rare masterfully achievement for TV with cult status like it is memorable Sopranos, Star Trek NG, Mission Impossible, Seinfeld, Twilight Zone and Tales from the Crypt to mention some of the best ever. Breaking Bad is as close to perfection that seems possible. It seems like we have been lead to believe that to have it all is not possible. You can have good writing and poor acting. Great acting supporting a flimsy plot. Great writing and acting but ineffective direction. <br/><br/>This show delivers on everything. The direction has a clear vision and is expertly and artistically executed. The acting from every character is superb, truly superb. The buddy comedy elements are subtle and engaging. <br/><br/>The writing deserves special note. In Shakespeare's tragedies the plot is always a decision or event from which everything organically stems. Every event in the show follows a stream of logic. There is nothing that is dredged forth to progress the plot, it is all the outcome of a few decisions. Breaking Bad is the same. There is no convenient plot devices or deus ex machina. No magic to dig the writers out of a corner like in Lost or characters acting out of character. <br/><br/>I honestly cannot think of a fault in this program. It is truly lightning in a bottle. I was wondering why Mr. White picked the name Heisenberg during his interview with gang leader Tuco. After watching the remaining episodes it became more clear. Those who have an engineering background will recall "Heisenberg uncertainty principle" which states that: certain physical properties such as position and momentum can not be known exactly at the same time.<br/><br/>Well same applies here to Mr. White aka Heisenberg and to this flawless show. What i speculate while watching and what really happens during the show never matches. You get flicks while expecting closure and you get intense moments of thinking on characters/story on the verge of a burst. After a while you stop guessing what will happen and drift to the attraction of great acting and unexpected storytelling. The tempo of creating suspension, developing characters and turnovers in story and the repetition of this whole cycle evolves into something quite original, into something I believe that is never done before. <br/><br/>There are a lot to say about for this cleverly made show ... I hope we see more work like this. This is a great show. First of all the look of the show is just absolutely outstanding. It has this greenish-yellow tint to it that makes the desert scenes all the more gritty and hot. You can really feel the heat from those scenes. The acting is without question movie-quality. In fact, the whole show has this movie feel that can only be described as a mini-movie for TV (not a TV movie though). I love the fact the show perpetuates drama in the most ordinary circumstances. Only The Sopranos came close to the balance that Breaking Bad has with its story lines. Altogether, Breaking Bad is the next greatest thing to Meth! Why God why? This is pure pain in the name of television show, utter garbage. This has got to be a seriously boring show. I gave it a try after lots of hype surrounding it. But all I got was painfully long stares and silences, and boring dialogues. Same boring storyline dragging along every episode. It soon grew on me. After giving it 9 episodes I finally gave up. I just don't understand the hype. And lastly it teaches guns drugs and violence is cool, what the hell? If you want gritty and riveting Dramas I'll recommend shows like Dexter and American Horror Story. I know I'm gonna get lots of thumbs down but sorry Breaking Bad did not impress me. I don't know why people are praising this show, there's no substance for about 70% of the time, just talking about something that doesn't impact the story. <br/><br/>The characters are very dull, and lacking in well character. I feel as though they are just there to look at; they don't connect with the character, I don't feel anything for them - which means that I don't care if they live or die - which means that I'm not in suspense at all.<br/><br/>There's about 3 good scenes in the whole of the show but 'Mythbusters' proved them all to be wrong and so unreal that it makes the chemistry feel cheap.<br/><br/>This show may appeal to some people but it really doesn't deserve 1/4 of the hype that it has.<br/><br/>Don't watch it, you'll be wasting your time. Brilliant screenplay, out-of-the world acting, genius direction, and mesmerizing camera-work combines together to make the greatest show on TV ever - BREAKING BAD. If there were a fair way to compare TV with movies, BB could have rated above the all time best movies.<br/><br/>The series starts of slowly, and in the first few episodes of season 1,it may just seem like a story of a jerk facing some serious mid-life crisis. Then the season got hit by writers strike and season 1 ended quickly.But once we are into the Season 2 Episode 1, it goes on to a different level altogether, and it simply keeps getting better and better right till the end of Season 5. I had the privilege of watching BB after the end of season 5, so I simply watched all the episodes back to back from start to finish. It was so very engaging, that if I had to wait a week for the next episode the suspense could have killed me.<br/><br/>The only other series that engaged me so much are Game of Thrones and Westworld. But the difference lies in the fact that GoT and WW engages the viewers somewhat by shocking them with the violence and sex, but BB only uses the acting and excellent writing to engage us. This makes BB much more realistic. I enjoyed a lot watching GoT and WW, but I'll never forget the impact BB made on me. Sure enough, I don't watch shows that get extremely hyped during their airtime; it leaves you longing for episodes, dreading cliffhangers and missing events just so you could see that one final episode. I like to start watching when it's all over and I have some spare time to watch it all through to the end and done.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad, with its incredibly high score on IMDb, was on my watch list ever since it ended couple years back. I mostly base my viewings on IMDb scores and thus I had very high hopes for the show. <br/><br/>The first season started of well, bit slow but it was new and refreshing, unlike anything else I had watched before and it hooked me. Season 2 was of a better pace and kept me gripping. However through season 3 I started getting annoyed; some of the characters choices were completely devout of logic and I started being confused as to why certain actions were made and how it was supposed to help the story. Ever since Walt admitted the whole thing to his wife, that's where I lost confidence in the show and the characters. It was illogical and not plausible for the story. His wife being a complete bitch all the time afterwards just felt like an easy solution to keep her in the show. <br/><br/>Season 4 is where I lost it. They got back together, sort of, he rants and she leaves, again... It became repetitive, and at no point did I feel suspense as should be with a good drama/thriller show or film. I stopped watching in the middle of episode 7, as I had abandoned all mimetic ties with the characters; I didn't believe them any longer. There was a relapse of character developments: one turning junkie and angry again, losing his family again, bla bla bla. <br/><br/>My biggest question remains this: why did Walt keep on protecting this Jesse, even with his 'steady job'? If he would have just let the kid be killed, it would have made for a much more interesting development, him becoming a darker kingpin meth cook, etc. Jesse as a character was becoming annoying and way to shallow and repetitive throughout the show, and I felt like the writers simply kept looking for pity excuses to keep him in the show.<br/><br/>I won't even start on the acting performance of Walt's wife, which was absolutely ridiculous. I get that they needed the baby for the story, but the age gap, having a kid at 50, that was simply unbelievable, in the literal sense of that word. If they had made him let's say 42, that would still have been believable, but 50, come on? Perhaps that's typical of American show, I don't know; they don't believe in birth control, I assume? <br/><br/>Shame, as it started off very promising. That's why you don't believe the hypes, it was probably for commercial purposes, to sell goodies and stuff, because frankly, it was good, but really not hype-worthy. <br/><br/>By the end, it felt like any typical American TV show and that's what bugged me. Till this day I prefer British TV, and it seems America, for me personally, has a lot to catch up to with regard to shows like Broadchurch, Sherlock, Shameless, and so on. Comedy-wise, well, that is an obvious one...<br/><br/>If you don't set your expectations too high, this is a good show. If you believe in the hype when going into it, you will be disappointed. Firstly I'd just like to say that its likely no show will ever get a 10/10 but for breaking bad to be the closest thing to a 10/10 is strange to me. <br/><br/>The show is good, there is no disputing that. It has a great plot, the characters are played wonderfully by Cranston, Anna Gunn and of course Aaron Paul, but there is a lot of good actors now a days and so a show aired to millions should be acted well.<br/><br/>The reason the show, for me, only gets at most an 8 out of 10 is because of the repetitive nature of it. This review maybe subject to criticism and people will not like me for putting down the ever amazing "Breaking Bad" but I challenge people to disregard what i'm saying as false because its undeniable that the show is repetitive. Walt and Jesse get together and cook meth, they come across a drug lord or someone higher in the drug hierarchy, find a way to knock them off their perch and the cycle continues. In between this larger plot repetition is the smaller plot repetition of Walt falling out with Jesse, falling out with His wife Skylar, and then managing to make up with them.<br/><br/>I understand its hard for TV shows to keep viewers on their toes and to not know whats coming next but its never good when a show is repetitive as this one. I've spoke to a lot of people with similar opinion and maybe its just me as a person and the kind of things I like but its hard to deny that the show repeats itself a lot once its been pointed out.<br/><br/>With all this being said the show is still worth a watch and is a good production definitely something innovative, my gripe is just with the fact that the show is so highly rated, above the likes of True Detective, Lost, Prison Break, The Wire, The Sopranos. Im not saying that these shows are a lot better necessarily but it should not be rated higher than them. An excellent series, I came here to advise all fans of good series and good actors, to attend this magnificent series, because this series is certainly marked by that. One of my main reasons for writing this is to thank all actors present in this series, that have done a great job, they are great professionals, thanks for the times provided. Bryan Cranston, was a phenomenal actor, that changes is personality from one moment to another, unfortunately haven't seen in other works, but surely i will look for him from now on. The most shocking, and perfectly executed scenes, are the one's with the famous Jesse Pinkman showing the life of an addicted, that surely is very compelling to see. I also want to give here my congratulations to the actor RJ Mitte still, that made a magnificent role, surprised me, and he is clearly a kid who we really like, trought out the series. Anna Gunn is the most sensual of all, the sexiest, unpredictable and the most brilliant women have seen, loved the actress. The ending part is excellent, because it is not the typical happy ending, and that pleases me very much, it needs to have a great message to do, and execute something like that. Thank you all. The two main characters in this series are annoying as hell. Walter White, supposedly a chemistry genius, is an underachiever in life but somehow decided to the dat boss upon releasing he's got cancer.He's so cocky that he thinks he's smarter than anyone.He killed two drug dealers and is responsible for the death of Tuco, Gale and Jane whose death led to a huge plane crash. And he's not guilty of any of those deaths, this makes me sick. Not to mention his secret gay/father-son love towards Jesse Pinkman. He's happy making millions cooking meth under the name of "providing for his family" which couldn't be further from the truth. Maybe he started with such intention but lost himself in the process. Now he's just ecstatic that he's actually achieving something for the first time in his life, regardless of how serious the crime he committed. He's also responsible for Hank's unfortunate injury. Jesse Pinkman on the other hand is a really nice person. He loves kids, cares for his friends, treats people well. He killed an innocent man only to save Walter and is forever haunted for it. But he's a junkie, this "habit" of his led to the death of his beloved girlfriend. He's damned. Now Gustavo Fring, this biggest drug deal north of the border, always drives himself without a bodyguard. And his man, Mike, who does everything for him yet still finds a way to earn some extra bucket working as a part-time PI. There are a few likable characters nevertheless. Mike being one of them. Saul Goodman and Hank Schrader are two of my favorites. I just finished the series and I signed up IMDb for the sole purpose of giving this 1 star.<br/><br/>The actors all do a good job with the parts they are given. Rather than spend time critiquing the on-screen talent I must voice my extreme displeasure with the writing. I guess now it's commonplace for television shows to be as violent and gory as possible (i.e. Sons of Anarchy) but in my opinion this was hands down the absolute worst piece of garbage to ever be televised.<br/><br/>I have zero desire to see people doing drugs. I have zero desire to watch human bodies chemically decompose. I don't see how it's possible for a nerdy high-school chemistry teacher to turn into such a horrible piece of filth. I don't want to watch innocent people get shot in the head by the dregs of society. Sorry, it's not my thing.<br/><br/>After the first two seasons I was ready to call it quits. Peer pressure and the "critical acclaim" was the reason I decided to finish it. All I have to say to that is - the masses are a bunch of idiots for enjoying this garbage. This is what happened during the writing process: "Hey, let's try to find up as many f'ed up ways for people to die as possible. Let's glorify the jerks that engage in drug trafficking and kill off innocent people, because hey, that stuff happens in real life." This series is proof of the total degradation of society. No, I'm not some grumpy old man. This crap makes me sick to my stomach. Since this was "wildly successful" then I'm sure other writers will try to push the bar even further. I will find a list of the writers and make sure to avoid any project they are ever involved with in the future.<br/><br/>Thanks for wasting my time. So, just like a lot of the negative posts on here, I also bought into the hype and watched it based on that alone. And then, just like everyone else who wasn't impressed as they worked their way through it, I went along with the 'stick with it, it gets soooo much better' advice. Only to end up (with the exception of a few supporting characters), finding the entire thing anti-climatic and pretty dull. What made things worse was that everyone was going crazy for this guy Walt that I felt like a creature from another planet when I discovered that I absolutely, most definitely couldn't stand him. I despised everything about him. He had delusions of grandeur, but put no effort into making a success of himself, but was bitter and resentful of others who'd succeeded. He may have started out with good intentions when he got involved in the meth business, but eventually it's pretty obvious that he continues to do it in order to feed his bloated, narcissistic ego.Normally with a character like this, you find some trait that balances out the bad and eventually creates some kind of empathy. But it never happened here for me. 
I stuck it out right to the bitter end, where I finally got my reward when I watched him die. Best moment of the whole goddamn thing. Watched Breaking Bad a few years ago, was really addicted to it. Watching this series all over again right now during this coronavirus pandemic. Still very enjoyable. It's no doubt top notch TV series. However, this time as I get to the late seasons, somehow I just grow more and more angry about WW by each episode. Sometimes feel an urge to just smash his wrinkled bald head. Feel almost zero empathy towards him. Feel angry about the damage he did to his family and people around him. Yes and the scripts and acting sometimes get a little over-dramatic. This style works better in Breaking Bad than "Better call Saul" -- the latter one I had to give up after 2 seasons despite its stellar reviews. The series tells about a chemistry teacher who, having learned about an incurable disease, begins to engage in drug trafficking. The main idea of the creators is a metamorphosis of the character from an antogonist to protogonist. The initial goal of the material well-being of the family after death becomes blurred towards the end. Walter, the protagonist, begins to like doing this business, begins to think like a criminal leader. Recommend watching this series to fans of crime and Mexican drug cartels. The tape itself is an example of the transformation of the characters to opposite ones towards the end. Left a mark in popular culture. I recommend for viewing. Just flawless acting,direction,casting and screenplay. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul were fantastic. A perfect end for a perfect series The series of events that happen in breaking bad perfectly shows that a man changes to thing he hasn't intended to become. I was with Walt, on his side for almost the entire series, but he lost me in season five. He'd become so ruthless and despicable I found myself unable to root for him and or sympathize with him any longer. He was a monster and while it was compelling storytelling, for me, he moved away from being the hero I could root for.<br/><br/>However, in this the last episode - in this scene in particular - he pulled me back in. He owned it, and I think in coming clean the creators were able to bestow some redemption for his character as a broken man who finally saw the error of his ways. One of the best series in my life. here is no limit for the character here to do things in the name of his family.
if we analyze the whole series, we see the well-planned character change curve of Walter. Bryan Cranston as Walter White and Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman had an extraordinary performance.
without exaggeration directed so beautifully. i was completed one season in a single day, such beautiful narration. we will fall love with these guys.
Also, the ending of the show is so beautiful and satisfying.
King of series..!!! Breaking Bad is a masterpiece..!! Only just now watched this series and it is a masterpiece. Walter White is truly the embodiment of evil. Just loved this show. Wow. Basically i loved with the character of Jesse Pinkman. 😍 This is by far the best series of all time, with special mention of the character development which was exactly how it is supposed to be. I wanna erase my memory and watch it again this is the best TV Show in history This is the first ever series I watched and I shouldn't have done so. I liked a couple other series after this, but nothing can beat this. Period.
Breaking Bad is a different experience! It feels better to rewatch this, than to try enjoying some new trash. The best tv series ever.totally original script from start to finish and acting was off the chain. What he's it about 40 times back to front and watched different eps so many times. Season five my favourite season and episode 7 to 16 in season five is completely amazing It has the best ending. So nice to watch this series. I am very thankful to actors for making this series more wonderful. Acting was excellent no disappointment. They ended this series very beautifully. Breaking Bad is The best TV series of all history ever I've seen.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to those who haven't seen it I've watched entire series probably 5 times now over the years. It is seriously that good. The greatest of all time. Most writers can find a struggle in combining both a plot driven and character driven story. Breaking Bad does this with brilliance and delivers such a well balance driven story where all characters intrigue you and the plot keeps you on the edge of your seat. This show is too addictive I watched all the seasons in one week every person should watch how the Heisenberg's and gustavo fring's minds work
The war of brains.it made me feel badass and I loved Jessie's character. Overall it was just amazing Especially loved the way it ended Shoutout Mr. White! Chemistry at its finest!! Los Pollos Hermanos!! When I heard the learn'd astronomer,
When the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns
before me,
When I was shown the charts and diagrams, to add, divide,
and measure them,
When I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with much
applause in the lecture-room,
How soon unaccountable I became tired and sick,
Till rising and gliding out I wander'd off by myself,
In the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time,
Look'd up in perfect silence at the stars. This series is masterpiece. My second most favourite show ever after "full metal Alchemist brotherhood". Love it. My favourite TV show. I have watched it like 20 times, it's just soo good. It's also consistently good, which is rare for a TV show as most seem to have atleast 1-2 weak seasons, but not breaking bad, each season is a solid 9-10.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this show and you are on the fence about watching it, then stop reading and get it on, it will be best decision you ever make. I have no ords of this series of how good is really is.... This is litterally i series that after you watch it u hope that u could delete the moments in your life watching to watch it again like you never knew it.... i hope i could did that tbh.. u will never get bored at any minute of the series... it will give u nice vibes and belive me... it will be days that u will never forget! The Best Show Ever Guaranteed!!!!! The first season was slightly daft, but season 2 was amazing, and it just improved from season to season, with season 5 being possibly the best season in TV history!!! Very good tv show. Lot of drama, some twists. Good acting, especially Cranston, who shines as much in drama as he does in comedy.
Some characters became unbearable to me, but I guess it's also a sign that's it a well done show.
A couple of very "hollywood cliché" things, but not to the point where it's too much. One of the very rare shows that remained consistent till the end. Breaking Bad, GOT and TWD started between 2009-2010. All of them are the biggest shows ever. GOT and TWD became worse towards the end. GOT ruined the entire final season with the worst ending. TWD became worse in S7 and it isn't like what it was before. Only Breaking Bad remained consistent till the end. That's why it is the best show ever created. Will in the season 1 i was waiting for something big, because from what I heard about this show it's "Legendary" show, but the season one was  normal one. Same goes to season two and three, In the fourth season it became more interesting and the show attracts you more than before. But when we talk about season five will it's fucking another story the last season was the best.
Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed this show.
I will give it 8/10 🙏🏼 I've never written a review of a television show in my life (46 years) and I never believe the hype. However, this is quite simply the best series I've ever watched that maintains momentum from start to finish. The writing, the character development and the chemistry form a perfect blend that stands apart from every other show. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul are brilliant together. Congratulations to the writer and cast for this masterpiece. This is an experience you'll never forget and no review can ever capture the rollercoaster ride and magic that is Breaking Bad. The reason that I have written this review is that true art and talent should be celebrated. This show is the best of TV, there has not been another show that I have been so invested in from beginning to end I was hooked, there was never a time where I thought "can this show ever be over", in fact when it did end I wanted more! (something Vince brought up in an interview was he wanted to leave on a high note and leave the audience wanting more).
There was never a time that I hated a character that was meant to be liked, I felt exactly as Vince Gilligan intended for us to feel about every character, I loved them when I was supposed to, I hated them when I was supposed to, I cried, I laughed, I got chills, my blood ran cold, and I felt at the end like I knew the characters and was personally involved.
Vince and co. should be proud this show was the result of firing at all cylinders and several things lining up perfect at the perfect time to create a show that cannot be forgotten.<br/><br/>There hasn't been a show this good and I'm not sure there ever will be again, and if there is then I'm pretty sure our minds couldn't handle it This show was by far one of the most enticing dramas I've ever seen. If you don't typically like crime shows involving drugs, don't let the premise of this show put you off... It's much more than a typical drug fueled crime show. One of the best Tv show ever made. It gets slow in season 2 and 3 and but 4 and 5 are well written. Small details were kept in mind while writing. Background songs in few scenes were nice to enjoy the events. Jesse and Walt will be part of your brain forever. I had never noticed how important things are like colors, scenarios, perosnajes and situations to be able to give life and realism to the situations I see through the T.V.
It is real thanks to this series that mepece to see and enjoy the cinema better, my true love. Breaking Bad is one of those TV shows where everything just miraculously falls into place. Such meticulously crafted plot with clever twists and turns that keeps the viewer engaged and thirsty for more with every passing episode. I can't remember any other show that so rigorously sticks to its core theme (which is "Study of Change") and yet still remains notoriously engaging and entertaining.<br/><br/>But this show at its core is a character study, so if you are just looking for a good time with pointless humor / action, this show isn't for you, otherwise do binge watch it ASAP, you don't know that you are missing out on an incredible show. Seriously. This show is no joke. Years later, it still holds up against other shows. It truly is the king of television, and should stay that way. The only thing I could say about this masterpiece is that, I wish I could erase my memory and watch it over for the first time again. I've seen this 4 times through, and you will never see a show like this again. Finally this is a show which meets all the requirements of a perfect show, various storyline but it is never confused and continues streamelining to the felina; acting is on spot especially Aron Paul;does justice by ending in 5 seaaons;ploys are rock solid and editing is the tightest on any TV show;and finally the show is never full of itself - it remains a show about water white. I'll be honest, at first when I started this TV show and finished first season, I didn't like it. It felt boring for me and I stopped watching, but after few years, I decided to give it a chance and continue. I'm so happy because of my decision, because after finishing this TV show, I can definitely tell that it was a masterpiece! 5th season is a bomb and 14th season was shocking! It left me with sad, euphoric shock feeling. It was mind blowing! I'm not gonna spoil you what happened, but if you started first season and you don't like it, for goodness sake, give it a chance and continue watching. I promise you won't regret.<br/><br/>Characters are very well developed. Acting is superb! Plot is very interesting. Whole TV show is tense, especially the last season. The only downside I can think about is camera. Sometimes it's shaking on some certain scenes. I don't know why they didn't pay attention to this, but this is nothing, just a very minor minus. Everything else is great about this TV show. It's been six years since this show ended and I STILL have a Breaking Bad-sized hole in my life. Truth be told, it's one of the only reasons I keep Netflix.I'm rewatching it now and it occurred to me that this show would NEVER fly today. You have to watch it to know the brilliance of writing, directing and acting. You'll fall in love with the characters. Brilliantly conceived and superbly executed. Vince Gilligan is a mastermind! He didn't only created the greatest show of all the time but he also created an era which will be remembered forever. And yes, the amazing performance by Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul and also by rest of the cast, will not let you leave your seat... This show started with a BANG and ended with the BANG too... Unlike many great shows which fails to end in a better way, this one would never disappoint you. Undoubtedly this is the greatest show of all time This is definitely the best series I've ever watched :) The most gripping, engaging show I have ever seen. So many scenes where you are on the edge of your seat anticipating the next event. On rewatch, you realize things you haven't realized before, it is crazy how good the writing from Vince Gilligan is. There are no concrete good guys or bad guys, just characters you despise or root for. CANT WAIT FOR EL CAMINO! Well i was a GOT fan till season 7 thinking i hit the jackpot but a friend of mine recommended and rather insisted that give Breaking Bad a go. 4 days later afyer actually watching 5 seasons (yes in 4 days) i was blown away, yes i couldn't get out of the chair, i practically skipped work just to watch more - That's how addictive this show is.
New Standards - i have never ever seen a show stand alone over all the freaking shows "Historically" as Breaking Bad did.
Masterpiece is an understatement!
Watch it of you haven't.
compared to GOT this show wins by 200% atleast! PERFECTION PERFECTION PERFECTION "PLEASE NEVER GET SPOILED BY THE OFFICIAL BREAKING BAD WIKI" PERFECTION PERFECTION PERFECTION Cmon it's breaking Bad... The characters are natural and flawless.. Story is awsome stretched a bit but still awsome.....
Season 1 was d most badass of all... U will know why just watch it..
U will love its most of the character....
Jesse pinkman and saul goodman are my personal favorite..
As the show was progressing I started hating my man walter white.... Then I just thought cmon buddy he is not ur good guy he is meant to break
bad... U will know wat I'm talking bout...
The shows badass..
I mean I can't think of words for this perfection...with only 2 episodes boring.. I mean just watch it... This is the greatest tw show i have ever watched.
I haven't any negativ aspect about this. One of the greatest TV shows ever made. After completing Game of Thrones, i was asking myself "WHAT'S NEXT "?, After some suggestions, i started watching Breaking Bad. First couple of episodes were boring hell, but after that story takes pace. It is unstoppable when you're into it. As my profession is also teaching, i was totally moved by the role Walter White. A great father, A great teacher and a Great Meth Cook. Unlike GoT, Breaking bad had its all loose ends sorted out perfectly. The ending of breaking bad is just EPIC.<br/><br/>now Breaking Bad is over for me, WHAT'S NEXT???
THE WIRE???? Anyone who hasn't seen BB: Could you name me something without any mistak...
Everyone who has seen BB: BREAKING BAD!!! Watched the series for the first time recently after reading all the reviews and wanted to see what all the fuss was about. I already want to watch it again, the best TV show ever made, congrats to all those involved A++++++++ One of the best integrated drama I have seen in my life the best integrated scenario and the output and coherence of creative events Awesome series got it all
Got the drama the action the tragedy the fear 😍When art mixes with science it produces us breaking bad One of the greatest if not the greatest show of all time D&D take notes!!!
This is show you nail an ending to a masterpiece of a show Unbelievable !!!<br/><br/>Unbelievable !!!<br/><br/>Unbelievable !!!<br/><br/>Unbelievable !!! Best series i ever see (:(: i love mr whites and i hate skyler The best serie, ever!
Not even game of thrones could beat him. I knew about this series because of my cousin's T-shirt 😆
I watched the first episode, and then immediately I watched all the series in 2 weeks or less maybe.
I have watched this series more than 3 times, and each time I feel like it's the first time because of the details. This tv show, as mentioned in the title, is more addictive than meth. Although it has a slow start, every episode comes with something surprizing. You start loving Walter while you hate his wife when suddenly you realize that Walter is the villain. Great show! This is the Best Tv Show of all Time a real Masterpiece! The Acting is Superb and all the Cast is Amazing there's nothing in this Show that I don't like and it only had 5 Seasons which Made this Show Stay True to the Fans! Not like the other Shows that have like 9 or 14 Seasons which are really boring and disappointing I wouldn't compare any other Tv Show like Breaking Bad! Also All of the Episodes And Seasons Of this Show are like Super Good And never disappoints and that's why this should be on the Number 1 Lists of Best Tv Shows everyone should Watch this Show it's very Enjoyable Fun And very shocking and intense too! Bryan Cranston Anna Gunn Aaron Paul ETC are the Best Actors! Rating 10 out of 10 Masterpiece. Love love loved it!! This had me glued to the TV! The acting is so well done and the story line is just as perfect! It's rare that these gems come along! The only thing I wished for (personally) was a better outcome for Walt and his family towards the end! It's somewhat of a sad ending but I guess it is more a dose of reality! So good! Great cast. Great acting. Great story. Simple production. Just wow. U can't stop at 1 episode. With Netflix i find myself watching the whole series again and enjoying it again. Bryan Cranston is the best actor for this role nobody can replace the characters here. Brilliant, bold, unpredictable, impactful, unforgettable. Breaking Bad is as close to perfection as a story can be. It stands above other tv dramas in nearly every way. The characters are complex, interesting and real. The changes in their character are subtle yet drastic. The writing is intense and the slow scenes are never boring. Even lines of dialogue that can seem unimportant can give insight to how a character feels. This is a story that no one should ever go without seeing. Study this in screenwriting school, in acting school, in every school. This is a brilliant timeless masterpiece and stands as our generations defining tragedy alongside stories like Hamlet. Nothing more can be said. A true 10/10. Breaking Bad is a complete masterpiece. The only time I was upset was when it was over. Bryan Cranston is phenomenal and the story keeps you on the edge of your seat. If you haven't seen it you need to watch it now! Simply Epic in every part of every episode of any season... I loved it and I will miss it Hard to believe that the high IQ man who was careful enough to dispose off a random potted , Lily of the valley , from his enclosed backyard ( a place never visited by Jesse Pinkman ) wouldn't destroy his copy of ' Leaves of Grass ' by Walt Whitman , complete with a handwritten tribute by the late lamented Gale Boetticher ( identifying him as the other ' W.W. ' ) .<br/><br/>But this same scrupulously , meticulous man , not only retained that particular book ( plus the inked inscription ) , but also paraded it on his toilet ( in the same house visited regularly by the tenacious Hank Schraeder )<br/><br/>Perhaps he was inflicted by an episode of somnambulism , when Hank discussed the killing of Gale Boetticher with him or when Hank speculated about who ' W.W.' was or Gale's interest in Walt Whitman's poetry ...<br/><br/>Or he just had amnesia & missed out that Agent Schraeder was obsessed with the hunt for ' Heisenberg ' ... an unfortunate side effect of his recent chemotherapy , perhaps ?<br/><br/>Too bad about the Skyler White backlash . Doesn't speak well of people calling the one ( sort of ) moral voice in the series , a ' b**** wife '.<br/><br/>Initially frantic with love & worry about Walter's hesitation to seek treatment , Skyler rapidly turned into a ferocious mother who is torn between keeping her children safe from Walter's nefarious activities & associates - seeking her to do the right thing & ask for a divorce ; torn enough by her love for Walter , to not report him & being terrified of his killings ; torn between figuring out that he's a criminal & wanting to look after him after his lobectomy ; torn between wanting to drive away to another state & living like a frozen shell who laundered his drug money .<br/><br/>Skyler also showed a keen intelligence in how she obtained Bogdan's car wash after he insulted her ; in how she tried to tone down Beneke's audit by appearing like an a ditzy , air- head to the taxman . Interesting that a woman of her cleverness & capacity to manipulate situations didn't use her powers for evil ,but only for clever tactics .<br/><br/>As right as she was (initially) Skyler isn't portrayed as a pleasant or charming woman - which may have lead to the backlash on Anna Gunn's character . A dismal state of affairs where viewers can't sympathise with a character who is suffering , just because she isn't sweet or appealing .<br/><br/>Skyler was at first reminiscent of the second Mrs . Corleone who questioned the conduct of her exalted husband Michael Corleone , unimpressed with money or power ( In stark contrast to the first Mrs. Corleone , who never questioned her husband , Vito Corleone - instead , wisely choosing to enjoy the benefits of living as the wife of a billionaire mafia godfather , posing as a benign Italian mama . Had she questioned the young Vito Corleone's ethics & not cooperated with him , she may not have had two sons & a grand-daughter who were gunned down & a son-in-law who was garrotted )<br/><br/>Criticism about R.J. Mitte's character was also odd - Walter Jr. was a nice son who seemed to be more mature & even-tempered than most 15 yr old boys . He took many things bravely in his stride - not acting out with his father's diagnosis , loving his family , playing with his baby sister , maturely enduring boys his age sniggering at his cerebral palsy in a clothing store , losing a Challeger in 15 hrs , enduring Hank lashing out at him from his hospital bed , trying to raise money for his father's treatment , hiding his disappointment gracefully from Skyler at the car he got for his 16 th b'day , supporting his father when he looked vulnerable & injured ( wrongly believing he was a gambling addict who relapsed & got into a brawl ) & fixing his broken glasses , getting angry with his father for hesitating to seek treatment , getting angry when his parents concealed matters from him & confused him ... what's not to like about Walter Jr. ?<br/><br/>In the final season , it was interesting to see the ' non - criminal ' adults , devolve . Under the strain of coming out to the Schraeders , Skyler requests Walter for a hit on Jesse ( which Walter doesn't heed to,at first ) ; Marie stupidly instucts Walter to commit suicide & then researches poisons to kill him ( which is strange since Walter never harmed her ... infact he helped her out with $ 176K worth of medical bills without taking credit for it , in front of Hank & also saved Hank from bankruptcy,from being sued by Jesse )<br/><br/>Equally devolved was Hank Schraeder , who cruelly forced Jesse into a risky sting operation , inspite of his refusals ; steamrolling Steve Gomez who voiced concerns about Jesse getting killed during the sting with a chilling reply about winning either way , if Jesse got murdered ( since Hank would have it on video as evidence .. cold blooded )<br/><br/>After Fring's death , Hank was ticked off by his superiors for playing favourites with his obsession with the elusive ' Heisenberg ' & neglecting all his other cases & duties as the newly promoted ASAC . His obsession continued even after he was ordered to call off the surveillance on Mike Ehrmantraut & close the case . Hank , not heeding to this order , lead to the death of Mike & the shanking of his 9 guys in prison along with their lawyer . Eventually , this unhealthy obsession lead to his own death & poor Gomez was part of the collateral damage .<br/><br/>Why did Schraeder want to arrest Walter so badly anyway .. the man was terminally ill with his second cancer . He was retired from the drug business .
Was it to serve justice to the criminals who died on the way ( like Fring ) or to their relatives ( like maybe Krazy 8's family ? ) Hank didn't care about pushing Jesse into a sting which could get him murdered - so he clearly wasn't doing this for the sanctity of the human life or for justice .<br/><br/>Or was it because Schraeder thought that his shooting by the Salamanca twins was because of Walter ? Was that why Marie slapped Skyler ? Well , it wasn't true anyway - Schraeder was shot because of Gustavo Fring . All Walter did was to pay $ 176K for Hank's therapy & ensure he didn't become a cripple ( & paying Jesse a $ 1.5 million partnership in Fring's set up , to not sue Hank & end his DEA career & bankrupt him )<br/><br/>Hank didn't even think of the legacy & permanent notoriety that would be left to Walter Jr. & Holly if their rapidly dying father were to be exposed .. or that they could lose their home , business etc. ; jeopardizing the innocents' reputation , education & future ; all for merely sending Walter to prison for a few weeks ...<br/><br/>
Hank's mad bull-headed rage was pointless . It served no sensible purpose when the object of his obsession was completely retired & to be dead in 6 months or less .<br/><br/>Jesse Pinkman refered to Walter as a ' greedy a****** ' , & so it seemed , until the end , where Walter was ready to trade all his barrels of money to Jack in exchange for Hank's life . Walter's megalomania was mistaken for greed .<br/><br/>Walter interestingly took zero credit in front of Skyler for leaving nearly $ 10 million with the Schwartzes & when he gave her the GPS coordinates to Hank's & Steve's grave , for a better deal for herself - he didn't point out , that by first asking for a hit on Jesse ( which he was reluctant for ) , she was even more culpable in Hank's death , than he ever was ( ironically she slashes Walter with a knife for Hank's death )<br/><br/>In the end , the unstable , self destructive & occassionally homicidal , addict Jesse , was the complete undoing of both the careful Gustavo Fring & Walter White ( Fring should've stayed true to
his sound adage about never doing business with addicts & by extension , his wise decision to have no dealings with Walter ( an addict's partner.. ) which he revoked for an offer of $ 1.2 million for 38 pounds of meth. after being badgered by Walter , who falsely promised him that Pinkman was at his end & solely his problem )<br/><br/>Walter had to clean up many times behind Jesse ( like he was his dad .. ) to save themselves from situations created by Jesse's naive mistakes ( dying out in the desert in a dead RV without water , gassing Emilio & Krazy 8 , leading Hank to the RV ) or outright saving Jesse alone ( from his dangerous junkie girlfriend , Jane Margolis , who started him on heroin , from Fring after trying to kill Fring's dealers & from Jack's crew after Jesse set fire to Walter's retired life ) .<br/><br/>With each of his 3 guilty , nervous breakdowns ( after Combo's death , Gale's shooting , Mike's death ) he destroyed aplenty , like a self-destructive , emotional , homicidal , out-of-control bull in a china shop .<br/><br/>Combo's death & Jesse's suicidal determination to kill two of Fring's drug dealers , forced a neutral & unwilling Walter ( who was sailing smooth seas ) to take sides , culminating in Walter killing Fring , finally . Jesse ruined that for Walter .<br/><br/>Jesse's instability about Brock further destabilized Walter's retd. life by unravelling the stalemate between the Whites & the Schraeders causing Walter to lose his money , turn fugitive , Hank's & Gomez's death & Jesse's own enslavement by Jack's crew .<br/><br/>Massacring Jack & his crew seemed unnecessary & illogical to avenge Hank. Jack executing Hank wasn't personal- only pragmatic ( & a lot less cruel than Walter's pragmatic & cold blooded shanking of Mike's 9+1 guys )<br/><br/>Looking back Mike Ehrmantraut would've probably wished he didn't make that call to Gustavo , when he saw the Salamanca twins walk into Walter's house with axes . Gustavo would've carried on with Gale running the lab he himself assembled .<br/><br/>The end of the series with Walter completing his to-do list ( leaving money for his children with the Schwartzes , GPS coordinates for Skyler's deal & saying goodbye to her , seeing his children , freeing Jesse from slavery , poisoning Lydia etc. ) & dying of a GSW was more conclusive than the end of Dexter - where Dexter should've died in the hurricane & been buried at sea with Debra . Let me tell you something about breaking bad
In my opinion it's the best series ever
The story is perfect. It has a fantastic finale
The characters are developed so good
And the more important thing this is a realistic story
You can understand the characters
Definitely we won't see something like this in years This is one of the best show i've ever seen . I just love it . I mean it's perfect in every single way . The actors are amazing and done a great job . This is the only series that gets better every single season. The personalities are very natural, very human. Their mistakes are even correlated to their previous experiences in life. Everything matches. In my opinion nobody could've done a better acting than Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul, they are just perfect for their roles. Not just them, every single character in the series is perfect for their role. This series is simply amazing. The main message in the series is "wake up, life is too short, live on your own terms" I know I'm probably writing this review for no reason, as there are already hundreds of thousands that you could read, but I needed to express my admiration for this utter work of art. In my opinion - and many others - Breaking Bad is the best TV series ever created. The basic plot greys the lines of morality by making the protagonist the villain. This has been done before, but never have I related to a criminal like this. The story structure is completely solid and the progression always works to further the main plot. The writing from Vince Gilligan is phenomenal; I can't remember an episode of the series that I disliked. The story was always furthered in each episode. Aaron Paul and Bryan Cranston portrayed their roles flawlessly, I don't remember a second thinking something was unrealistic or cheesy from them. But while Cranston was entirely spectacular, I never felt the same connection with Walt that I always felt with Jesse. Aaron Paul absolutely blew me away with his performance, portraying Jesse Pinkman as a pitiful addict who you just want to comfort. Overall, this series has no flaws. I will recommend it to everyone of my friends until they all love it as much as I do. 11/10 stars, thank you Vince Gilligan for making history. Now this is what i call a classic crime genre series. Just perfect start and perfect ending. Go for it guys right now, you will just love it. This show shows you the perfect writing, acting and filming. This show is just perfect, there is not even one thing wrong with this show. The ambiental of the hot city of Albuquerque(hope I got it right) is just lovely.
I gave it the "most flawless show ever" award. But dont misunderstand it with the best show ever. The only show the beats Breaking Bad is The Sopranos, by far. But this show is really nice. It is a MUST watch. This show is just the best. It's smart, witty, suspenseful, heartbreaking, and just great all around. The acting in it is amazing and the writing is brilliant. I don't think there will ever be a show of its caliber. If you haven't watched it by now, I highly recommend it. The story doesn't have any "holes" the characters are well written and the direction is just magnificent.
That's all , enjoy the show. If you looking for : Drama,Action,Love even Gangsters .. will: Hallow their.
This is the most TV shows having everything I have watched a lot of tv shows, and I impressed many many series but I didn't watch any series like Breaking Bad. It changes my life in terms of many things. It has an amazing scenario and perfect editing. There is no cliche dialogues and it has fantastic dialogues like "Tarantino style". Also I cannot explain acting of Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul. They are really really extraordinary. And director of cinematography.... Oh my goodness! The greatest thing since sliced bread! And and Vince Gilligan.. You are a genius. Thank you very much for this awesome masterpiece! :) Drugs. One of my interest. Slightly better than Prison Break. I watched it with my family. I Was 13 when i was watching it with my family so i was a bit ashamed because of Sex scenes or swears in the 1st season. But my dad said its in a humans nature. :) One of the best series ever made in the history 😍 Best show ever. Science crime family Disease everything under a show.. Hatsoff creators If you haven't seen breaking bad you need to see it. I cannot say enough good things about Breaking Bad. The writing, the cinematography, the acting, the editing....all of it is top-notch. I doubt a TV show will ever surpass this. This is a true masterpiece and one of the beat series i have ever seen The best show I've seen on TV. There is nothing like Breaking Bad. This is undoubtedly the best series I have ever watched. Have watched it through 3 times... the characters, acting and writing are all fantastic. Best thing on Netflix. It is the best TV series i have seen by far. Actually "the best" is an understatement. Breaking Bad is the most greatest thing ever happened to me. It is just that this show has a power to force one to watch it again and again. I definitely recommend this masterpiece to everyone. You have got to watch this no matter what. The bad thing about watching breaking bad a second time is that you can't watch it a first or a second time ever again. The good thing was that I liked it even more than the first time. So if you are waiting for a TV show with a similar excellency, watch Breaking Bad again.<br/><br/>If I had to summarize Breaking Bad in just two words, it would be "just perfect". And I mean that in every way possible. The script, for instance, never makes a "mistake". The entire story, in all its exceptionality, makes perfect sense. Never a enforced situation. It's like, once characters were placed, the script wrote itself.<br/><br/>Besides the mind blowing journey and the astonishing performances of the actors, I would like to mention two other features that outclass all other TV shows by far : the conversations (so real,so natural and yet so powerful) and the non-conversations as in "one image tells more than a thousand words". Brilliant !<br/><br/>(english is not my native language, so pardon me if some words or phrases are unclear) Just finished watching. best TV show of all time. love it very much. this is what i call art. love last moment with skyler. but most heartbreaking for me was to see jesse like this. he was broken and killed from inside. i cried a lot on final moments but, hank's death wasn't showed by the best way Not quite on this website, but at least on others, this is ranked as the greatest TV show of all time and it's pretty easy to see why. Everyone should be familiar with the story already. It's about this guy named Walter and his assistant Jesse who sell meth initially to raise money for Walt's family as he hears he's dying but eventually himself becomes selfish and destructive. Right from the get go, we get a fantastic set up and iconic images and characters. Probably the main reason this show was so wonderful was simply because it didn't try to be anything more than it wanted to be.<br/><br/>It just wanted to be a realistic representation of the increasing insanity of an ordinary person and the huge web of destruction he got himself entangled in. There are so many unique and profound characters in this show that it's hard to name them all. Okay, I can still remember the two main ones I just mentioned. Maybe the main appeal was that this show didn't go on too long. It had a very defined story that it wanted to tell and it wasted no time in telling it right away. It just seems like not a single episode of this show was wasted.<br/><br/>What's amazing is how smart these characters are, especially Walter. From the very first episode, we see how observant he is noticing all the little details in everything and how they can help or hurt him. The story continually builds on itself until the massive explosion in the last episodes, giving the viewers exactly what they want. It may be the most dramatic show I have ever seen in my entire life. Everything is so intense and realistic. It's great that a completely ordinary show manages to be so effective and influential. **** This is the most thrilling detective fiction,i have ever seen,as the full plot has grown on real circumstances and need and a troubled man's psychology.Walt's unconditional love,devotion and affection for his family is really heart touching.This is the fusion of love and hatred,presented beautifully through the protagonist. Walter White has some resemblance to the ideal tragic hero.The tragic heroes of earlier tragedies fall due to some error judgement or because of some tragic flaw in his character,but according to me it can be called an "Existential Drama" as protagonist is himself responsible for whatever has happened to him.It presents the mystery of suffering and pain.Each character has been presented with its own depth and psychology.Walt is the character of varying degree of consciousness who fall in certain circumstances and he had to choose.His choice will determine his future.He didn't choose to give up until he was dead.His motto was live free or die,he had definite affirmation to the right of his family.He always was ready to sacrifice his own life even his money for the sake of his family.His choice led him to his martyrdom.Despite being an archetypal person he wrestled modern circumstances and society,where he made dead thread his everyday's company.The subtle temptation of money set himself up against his own family and state.He is a tragic hero for at the still point wheel.All contradictions are reconciled.He didn't lose to his fate.The tragedy lies in the fact that he didn't beg or gave up at the extreme level of loses.that is why we can appreciate his all negativity in a positive tone in this particular series or context.And finally we can quote Hank<br/><br/>"You are the smartest person I have ever met....." All of the characters in BREAKING BAD are flawed (many very deeply), and they all make mistakes and, sometimes, baffling choices. The line between good and bad isn't clear; in fact, nobody comes off looking particularly good here, including Walt's DEA agent brother-in-law, Hank (Dean Norris), who's brusque and often insensitive. Some episodes move a bit slowly, while others have more momentum -- sort of like Walt himself, as he tries to cope with the mess his life is becoming.<br/><br/>Cranston's phenomenal performance is the best thing about the show. Forget the spacey, clueless dad of Malcolm in the Middle. Walt may be tired and beaten down, but Cranston manages to bring enough dignity to the man that it's possible to believe him when he's acting like an idiot and being socially responsible at the same time (such as when he narrowly escapes the bad guys, then tells his drug dealing partner, "We have to clean this up") The first two times that I watched this show, I had to stop after an episode or two. Its pace was too slow for me. In hindsight, guess it was for the best in a certain way. This time, around two years after my previous viewing, I was able to analyze it more minutely and critically.<br/><br/>Yes, the show starts slow. But actually it takes its time developing the characters and rewards the viewers who stick with it.<br/><br/>For me, the whole process of watching Breaking Bad was a lot like that of watching the anime Death Note. I rooted for the central character in the beginning, convincing myself that what he was doing was necessary and there was no other way. Then I hated him at a certain point, but could not help rooting for him again during the last few episodes. Also, in both cases, after completing the show I spent a whole day contemplating, analyzing, trying to pinpoint where it had gone all wrong for him, his point of no return et cetera.<br/><br/>Besides being an excellently acted show with complex characters, it was also a visual treat and the sound engineering was something to behold. While watching the show, one will notice that the colors the characters wear represent their mental states and the lighting sometimes foreshadows something ominous.<br/><br/>Take it from someone who knew about most of the crucial plot elements before even watching it - it does not matter how much of it has got spoilt for you, there will still be a lot to enjoy and take away from this show. Let me start off by stating that I thoroughly enjoyed this show. Indeed, I have watched the series twice and have begun the spin-off. I have followed the actor's works in other film/television and find them to be very talented. I have watched humorous YouTube videos about the show; indeed I believe I would even be interested in learning more about the show and the people who worked on it. That is to say, I would like to go "behind the scenes." That being said... The one episode that seems to be stuck in my mind is the episode about the fly. The fact that you could film 45ish minutes of television about trying to get rid of an insect and get people to watch it...amazing. Their lives must be pretty boring. Next thought: Did you actually film in New Mexico? Did you learn of it's history, it's culture, and past while you were there? Or was it just a place to film? One thing I didn't necessarily like was how Walter manipulated this boy, this kid into commuting murder and dissolving bodies and such. Still, did the boy have much of a future as a druggie? One positive thing that can be said, is they go out with a bang, quite literally. I think so much of the audience is captivated because it provides a darker alternative to their lives, perhaps stirring up feelings of what they might do or at least consider doing if they were in such a position. Indeed, I think some of the binge watchers even crave such a life. Dark comedy starring an Anti-Hero with a PhD in Chemistry who is the baddest dude on TV since Dr. Quest & Race Bannon put together. A pregnant wife, a thankless job, lung cancer, no insurance, and a son with cerebral palsy to drive him nuts. A sleaze-bag lawyer named "Saul" played (and probably written) by a former Saturday Night Live writer. A puppy dog sidekick "Jesse Pinkman" who is a severely flawed but impossible to hate. A serene drug kingpin so smooth and endearing you would give him your children to baptise. A bad-ass republican DEA agent who always gets his man, even if it's his brother-in-law. There is enough moral conflict in this show to sink the titanic. Nobody escapes with the innocence intact! I do have to say this is one of the best TV series i have seen in a while. it has everything drama ,action , drugs and more . i found the first series to be very light hearted in comparison to the rest of the TV show as Walter is starting out and really doesn't know what to do and is afraid at everything. After the episode in the first series where he is Nico's place (i think thats his name not sure)and blows it up with a meth look-a-like bomb, he starts to realize he gets a buzz from what he is doing and from there on he slowly develops into a man who you can hardly recognize as Walter wight.i do think the second series out of all of them was kinda weak in comparison to the others as Walter takes a break from dealing drugs and it focuses more on character development.Over all i think this TV show is incredible and Bryan Cranston's performance was truly amazing especially since this is the man from Malcolm in the middle. Aaron Paul was very good in this also and you get to see how Jesse slowly spirals down from confident to timid and you can see how the events of the series have effected him greatly. How good is Breaking Bad ???<br/><br/>It made me create an IMDB account to rate and review it, For the first time ever i started Keeping 'Heisenberg' pic as my Whats App DP and Laptop wallpaper and I started fighting with other TV Show lover to announce Breaking Bad is the best ever show.<br/><br/>PS: I'm still not feel like watching any other show on Netflix. Breaking Bad is an Obsession. Watching the show before finding out that it won so many awards helped as it leads to a perception being created. Better to watch it without so much of expectations. But after having watched it, I can say it deserves all the praise!!! My god I love every character's development. The makers really knew where they were taking. The cast was perfect for their respective roles. Just amazing performances, like they were meant to do their roles. Keeping it all spoiler free :)
P.s- this is the first thing I have done after creating IMDB account, total fan. In India there is a huge fan base of webseries of Netflix Amazon Prime hbo and many more plzz dubb this series breaking Bad in hindi also Amazing series recommended. It wasn't the best start though Seriously man.... No words to explain. Watching on Netflix and damn dude; i am struck so hard that I am unable to focus on my Job..... Still watching and finish sooner so that I can safeguard my Job.... I started watching this series by the Recommendation of a friend and now I have recommended it to all my known person. It's one of the most amazing series I have ever seen,every season gets better and better. I even started skipping my office to watch the series. Characters like Walter White, Jesse Pinkman, Hank, Gus Fring etc will Blow Your Mind with their acting. It's the finest series till date and a must watch for all. There is nothing more you can expect. Still not able to find any better series then this. The show is superbly written ,the acting is sublime I could not fault any of the hundreds of actors in this show every one from large parts to the smallest delivered a faultless performance and you will want to binge watch from first episode and be sad when you reach the series finale Not many shows score a 10/10 from me and the only ones that do have to be that good I would sit and rewatch the whole series and enjoy it as equally as I did when I first watched it! This is one of those rare gems! I can't, i just finished the show, i have no words... it's the best show ever, Just no words... I have never seen such wonderful nail biting and wonderful series. it should be e more than that in episode wise .best of the best thank you for making such a great series I will admit , first 2 seasons were good but ok but then from season 3 onwards , every episode got us hooked, hank , junior white , jesse ,<br/><br/>
Superb : worth you time<br/><br/>better than G O T , which had no end ,, well u forget about got after watching this ,,, i finished it in quarantine , was on watchlist from so long ,,,,. i really wana know tho ,, who writes these series , n where did this chemistry knowledge come from ????<br/><br/>anyways ðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜‡ Breaking bad truly deserves the number 1 position in ratings.It leaves you awestruck. Once you have watched it you won't like any other tv series as much as you like breaking bad. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul are fantastic. Vince Gilligan knows what the Audience wants. Vince Gilligan has done an excellent direction. Best TV series ever. This could easily be Bryan Cranston's tour DE force. His skill and versatility are on display the entire series. For any fans of this genre, This is must see TV ! The best show ever! I'm gonna watch it again and again! This is obviously the best tv series. Jesse pinkman and walter white are amazing One of best shows on TV and that's including GOT. I want to watch again and again, the roller coaster of feelings! Its perfect nothing else can be said about it. The way things link together and unfold is brilliant, to Change it in any way would be a apocalyptic mistake. This one is the best. It's start and ending both are awesome. I'm gonna watch it again and again. At starting episodes i don't felt i'm gonna love this much as its hype was created by my friends. I was wonder and still wondering that I'm giving more rating than GOT,
If you didn't watch yet and thinking to watch some series then this is the best choice amongst any other, watch this first then go any another option.
My most favorite Episode is S4 E8 Best show in the whole universe thank you Vince Gilligan for making this masterpiece This Show is Just a Fantastic show specially when it comes to a dialouge between Walt an Jessie it's Amazing Words can't describe the acting/screenplay/sound design/score/cinematography/direction/ oh, did I mention acting? I don't think there's anything else to say about this masterpiece of a TV show that hasn't been said. Awesome from first episode to last (except the boring, pretentious, and lame fly episode). Acting, incredible. Storyline, fantastic. Writing, amazing. Characters, deep and meaningful. The show remains with you long after watching. It is best.not be comparable with another.
Best dialogue,
'I like this,i was good at its,and i'am alive.' If you've never watched the entire series of Breaking Bad..... I envy you. There's never been a TV show or even movie that has captivated me like BB. I wish I could go back in time and watch for the 1st time again.
Breaking Bad is.... hands down, without question....the best TV show ever. I'll go even further: BB is THE BEST story ever told with a live action camera.
Yes!..... it's that damn good.
If you haven't watch BB yet (not sure how that's even possible with how epic it is), do yourself a favor and treat yourself to the best story ever put on a screen Breaking Bad is the Best TV Show I ever watched and it's every episode is fine as Hesinberg's Methamphetamine ðŸŽ©ðŸ‘“ðŸ”«ðŸ’°.
Vera level Yo!! Simply the best. The chemistry between Jesse and WW is unbelievable. I'm gonna keep it short and simple
In the first 2 seasons you will find it kind of boring but believe me in the end of the show you will not know what happened to you from that amazing ending
I just wish I can forget it and watch it all over again The character of Walter White is you, me, and every human being that surrenders to his desires and himself, while Hank is the spiritual resistance against the desires of the body and the love of money, it is an indescribable series in the beauty of written characters and the magnificence of performance from Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul, when I finished watching the series, a set of ideas came to my mind, which are elegant<br/><br/>1) The truth whatever you hide it will be revealed, even after a while
2) Lying, fraud and murder are devastating things even if they did for good reasons, the end does not justify the means
3) Hank, Skyler and Jesse Pinkmin are the characters that resisted Walter" Hiesenberg" and triumphed over them in goodness and this gives us a lesson that we do not despair and that we can resist evil because we will triumph and this will became in their lives and lives of the viewers a point of salvation
4) To admit that you are bankrupted and in urge need of money is exactly similar to as if you admit that you are wrong and in need of a forgiveness, escaping from that fact and covering it up behind the fake pride destroyed Walter and it may also destroy us if we follow him !!<br/><br/>
Legendary series 100/100 Breaking Bad is the Best by far! I have seen it twice and I am going to watch it again!and every time it's better! Here goes for my first review, I imagine it would be fitting to make it for my favorite TV series of all time.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad is simply a trip -- for lack of a better word.
Throughout this review I'm gonna speak on my personal feels regarding this series, leaving out most of the technical things, i.e. cinematography, acting performances, etc. I can sit here giving endless praise for all of that as I'm sure thousands of others have before me.<br/><br/>That said, I have watched this series -- front to back -- five times as of 2019. There's something captivating about the entirety of the story. Everyone on the team did an amazing job at creating what I believe to be the best TV show of all time.<br/><br/>I've left any mention of anything relating to spoilers out for one reason:
If you haven't watched this series yet, WATCH IT. Go rent it from somewhere if you have to, go torren- err.. I don't think I'm allowed to finish that sentence. Just watch it by any means necessary -- I'm serious.<br/><br/>Perfect 10! I have no doubt this show is gonna be looked back on as a timeless classic, immortalized in history. Seeing the first episode I thought: 'Mmm, I don't know or I like the subject of drugs.' But I'm happy I continued watching, because it's so so good! This is a 'must see series'! Season one might be a little daft for some people, but it only gets better, season 3-5 being unbelievably incredible!!!!! Good God. I wish I watched this when it was on air, instead of on Netflix, 6 years after it's end. Vince Gilligan proved himself to be one of the greatest storytellers of all time, taking a mere chemistry teacher and turning him into a kingpin. Every episode of this show is special, from trying to find a fly, to selling meth in a junkyard, to blowing up a nursing home to kill Fring. There is no doubt this is one of, if not the greatest shows of all time. If I was told the dad from Malcolm in the middle would become one of America's greatest actors by playing a meth cook some time ago, I would have called you crazy. But, Breaking Bad pulled off the impossible, and revolutionized television as a whole. You've got to watch it!
1st season drags on a bit but once you're into it you're hooked! Recommend to everyone Amazing series! How characters change throughout is incredible! I watched 5 seasons in a row and that movie too.. Now those characters are still in my head, greatest storytelling achievement ever.. I can watch 100 more seasons.. This is the greatest TV show ever made. ONE OF THE FINEST SERIES EVER MADE
no other tv show can comoete with it or will compete with it for ages to come. Will be my favourite of all content out there in world Breaking Bad is only a show which worth to watch every time I have watched this series 3 times and every time I fall in love acting story Drama emotions family eager to earn money Aggression Violence and more importantly its not all fantasy not fictional. Every person can relate to it if a person diagnosed by some series disease first think comes in his mind is what happened to my family when I am not here for them. I don't want to spoil this show in case if you haven't watched it. highly recommended Bryan and Aaron have perfected their rolls as Jessie Pinkman (Aaron Paul) who is the junky of all junkies and Walter White (Bryan Cranston) who played a top Meth maker, Meth seller and the biggest drug lord of Albuquerque.<br/><br/>Walter was originally a Chemistry teacher that gave it all up to become a multimillionaire drug seller and people often refer to him as Heisenberg.<br/><br/>You must give this series a go if you want to get a full satisfaction out of it! Greatest of All Time
Love ya jesse what up biatchh A Complete show..Wish I could understand that Chemistry is so interesting.. Great series ... didn't watched anything else .. till finished it.. The main character is a high school chemistry teacher and he diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer. He turned to manufacturing and selling drugs in order to secure his family's future while being the teacher. He became more bad person as time went by. At the end, there was no impression that he used to be a teacher.
It worth watching it! One of the best TV shows of all time. Not a single episode was even the slightest bit boring, and they were all very important. First season was very good, the rest was absolutely incredible. The acting is impressive. Standout performance from Aaron Paul. Show is very dark and gritty. Very great performance from Bryan Cranston. His performance really makes you feel for his character. Lots of suspense throughout the series. Keeps you on the edge the entire time. Final episode concludes the show in a very good way. No plot holes, no mistakes made. Ends in a perfect way. Great show, one of the best shows of all time. Watched the whole series in less than a month. Greatest thing I've ever watched it is unreal best thing ever so unreal amazing Even better a second time around. Bryan Cranston gives the performance of his career as Walter White and Aaron Paul is exceptional as Jesse. Gripping drama with great humour throughout. It's perfect from beginning until the end.
A masterpiece! All I want to know is after. El Camino we need a Gustofo and Johnathan Banks spin off One of the best series ever created. Great character development, good suspense and really good acting. Best Story Narration in all The TV series
Acting of every character
is good
There is suspence till the last scene This show keeps you on your toes each episode. It's put together so beautifully. Breaking bad is the show that I never forget in my whole life & I thik Bryan & Aaron done it by it's perfection & also entire cast is brilliant & As always miss u Mr White The best show in television history period............. Obsessed.
This show is incredible!!
Would recommend it to anyone. Why I can't get out from this series I already watched it 5times and I'm starting the 6th .thisis great series the most ,Breaking bad the best I am unable to write anything that can tell you just how good this series is. I watched it in 2008, and I watched it again recently. Has anything come close? There have been other good series since. However, whatever comes next will have to exceptional to better this. Have fun. 😎 This is one of the best series I have ever watched, it's abit of a slow starter but it's so worth the watch. I have watched this series 3/4 times since it's release and I enjoy it thoroughly every time!
Would highly recommend to anyone! A man can be anything seriously,at one moment he can be a school chemistry teacher and at the next moment he can this most wanted man in the town due to multiple crimes including drug business,robbing a train, attempting lots of murders in his interests..I mean there is no limit for the character here to do things in the name of his family.<br/><br/>This simply shows that one person can be this much dark at a time and bright as well at other point.The one thing I liked about this leading character is he is just fearless to do anything,he doesn't have anxiety issues,he is not obviously coward at all,he is a real man,he understands that he is a man he have to do things that is best suited for his family,it doesn't matter for him whether his family love him or wait for his death,it doesn't matter his son is abusing him,he just want to provide the drug money to them.<br/><br/>He has this hard heart that he goes on murdering hell lot of people,but it didn't affect him mentally,while Jesse finds it hard to deal with his ongoing emotions.<br/><br/>Walter white is also very much greedy for money,it doesn't matter for him whatever hell may happen,he doesn't seem to be demotivated, demoralized to start his illegal drug empire again and again<br/><br/>He is right at his cooking after every tragedy,he is playing around and using his brother-in-law all the way,until his brother-in-law actually finds his truth.<br/><br/>I think Walt and her wife had hurted Mike and her wife so much,but they were still very much supportive at times to them,so I felt very bad at Mike's death and about her wife,yes her wife is kind of a thief,which found certainly unexpected at times.<br/><br/>
Walter White was certainly luckiest,smartest,selfish,rock hard character shown in this web series,where I think we must face situations in our life like this,I mean we can't kill the people who betrays us,put us down,bullies us,threatens us in real life,just like Mr. white did in this series,but we can at least forget,forgive those people and situations,get out of the city where you live,get away from the people who let you down and always go for a new start at new place somewhere,which may turn out to be fruitful for everybody.<br/><br/>This web series is so much addictive,I binged watched for 1 week to finish it totally. This show set out with a goal. The main character was going to completely change over time. It accomplished this, and with some incredible television in the process. This show is so perfectly threaded all the way to the end and in this, to the absolute detail. In this show, you will see some of the best acting that has ever been exuded, particularly Bryan Cranston's performance of Walter White, which I regard as the greatest acting performance that I have ever witnessed, along with Heath Ledger's performance of the Joker in The Dark Knight. Giancarlo Espacito as Gustavo Fring and Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman do some sensational acting as well however. Pretty much every element of this show is levels above any other show from the acting, to the writing, to the cinematography, to the direction, and pretty much every element. The relationship between the two main characters Jesse Pinkman and Walter White is really the driving force of the brilliance in this show. The chemistry, no pun intended, between Aaron Paul and Bryan Cranston is truly incredible and a marvel to watch. The relationship between these two characters goes on such a rollercoaster in this show, and it's simply a marvelous thing to behold and experience. In the end, the two switch roles in a sense. Jesse Pinkman was somebody who found himself in this dangerous business but should not be in there in terms of who he truly is. Walter White is somebody who found himself as a chemistry teacher but should not be in there in terms of who he truly is. In the end, Jesse needed to get out of there and get away from the monster that his ex-teacher has become. It's truly an amazing thing to see, the radical changes that the characters go through. As Walt says in the first episode, chemistry is the study of change. And that's what this show is as well. Walter White, this seemingly-regular-chemistry-teacher-turned-wicked-druglord, is the greatest character I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing in a work of art. Bryan Cranston's performance allows us to see all of the nuances of his character and what goes on in his mind, and we see him transform before our eyes. The show has so many moments that will stun you, so many moments that will live on in pop culture long, long past the demise of this show, and so many moments that will make you marvel at the brilliance that you are witnessing. As intense and large scale as the show gets, it pretty much always stays in realism. That's one of the main factors that drives Breaking Bad apart from a lot of other shows. Whether comedy or serious, you can truly believe that this is what would happen next if this was reality- if this high school chemistry teacher really did become this murderer. The best fantastical and generally large-scale shows are the ones that are made realistically as we can engulf in ourselves in this world and crazy situation, and that is a joy. To feel like we're really experiencing something that's so insane and unusual. And that's the feeling that you get with this show. The writing crew let the characters drive the story rather than the writers. They didn't add the scenes that they wanted to happen; they added the scenes that they thought would happen. That's what drives Breaking Bad apart, and in this realism, we still end up with some of the most intense and incredible moments that have ever occurred in a show. This show really is as good as they say. I've never seen a better show, and I'm not sure I ever will. This is as close to perfection that I have ever seen a show reach. Vince Gilligan is a genius, and I thank him and the rest of the cast and crew for this beautifully twisted masterpiece of art. So, for the past 2-3 years a series I've fell in love with and dedicated watching, has been Breaking Bad due to word of mouth recommendations. The whole series was out-gloriously-standing and Vince Gilligan added a great deal of twists and turns within the story over 5 seasons to keep me gripped in the storyline. The ensemble casting has added to the depth of the story combined with amazing effects, videography, photography and in turn amazing characters etc. All of which making this series a master piece to watch and very, very pleasing to watch exploiting an unexplored market which undoubtedly contributed to this success. Lastly, watching the 5x16 finale just there, has meant that I can leap into El Camino and follow the story further, with confident eyes/ a clean mind and just enjoy what happens more. There is nothing to say that has not been said repeatedly over and over again. If you still have not watched breaking bad, you are not watching television period. Go and watch it, you will not regret it. The best best best tv series i ever watched...absolutely best...so addicted..❤ The story is like magnet it will still go with you after ending of series Incredible storytelling and phenomenal acting. So smart. A true marvel. 10 stars ⭐ Between all movies and series i've watched in my life. This is the only review i posted. I will say it deserves the awards literally the best TV show ever casted. I only wish Vinice didnt stop there. That kind of work nobody wants to stop watching. I love it by all means.
Thank you for the great great time i spent watching it. Best series in the world.
Amazing in all the ways. If you missed it you will regret. This thing is great great great and Vince Gilligan is genius. As I get further into watching Breaking Bad I realise just how good a show it is and why it is regarded as one of the greatest shows of all time. The premise of the season sees Walter cooking Meth for a buisnessman and Jesse in rehab as a pair of assasins hunt down the man known as Heisenberg. Bryan Cranston is amazing as Walter White, he is intense, charismatic and I haven't cared about a character more then Walter in this season of the show. There isn't much more to say except that this is one of the best written characters to have ever existed on TV or Film. Aaron Paul also gives a brilliant perfromance as Jesse Pinkerman, you truly care about his character this season and he delivers some excellent dramatic acting, their chemistry this season oozes off the screen and builds an amazing partnership. Dean Norris as Hank is one of my favourite characters on this show and this season his character is given fantastic development and becomes so much more then a loud comedic character. Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman is one of those characters who is so charismatic that you can't help but keep your eyes glued upon him even amongst Cranston and Paul. Giancarlo Esposito plays Gus, and he is a great change of pace as a drug lord showing a more calm composure that has a very good relationship with Walter White. The stroy of the season twists and turns throughout and unlike the last two seasons it kept me engrossed throughout and I was surprised just how many twists the season takes in a positive way to keep me guessing. The script is fantastic with some amazing dramatic moments mixed with an appropriate use of humour to make this over the top situation feel very real and human. The style is more suspensful this season and it really did a great job of making you care about the situation and the characters. Overall this season is an amzing season of television and if you have not watched this show start as soon as possible. What can I say in this review that hasn't already been said? This show is a masterpiece! The greatest show in all of television history. Beautiful writing and directing in every episode, unparalleled acting, and some of the most creative cinematography and editing I've ever seen. The character development throughout the show is so fascinating and keeps you engaged through the last show of the series finale. Believe the hype. It's real. One of the greatest things that made TV Integrated in all respects and the greatest end of TV history Love this show period. Truly amazing work by amc. I loved the writing and acting. Paced beautifully through and through. Most series (Film and movies) start to decline over the years *cough *cough Game of Thrones but Breaking bad only got better Trust me this is the best TV show that ever existed and its ending is surely satisfied by any viewer.<br/><br/>The storyline is just soo perfect and no matter what this show has got its best duo(Walt and Jesse).<br/><br/>This show should be on your watchlist.<br/><br/>
And Better Call Saul.. This is a once in lifetime opportunity. Wish i could delete my memory of watching it. It is so good that you completely forget that you are watching a series. Some scenes let me suffer depression for a few hours after. Can't think of a single aspect that was not perfect Just finished the series. Wow. It left me broken knowing that I will never watch something so well made again. Everything about Breaking Bad is flawless. People and Studios should learn from Breaking Bad. The greatest series of the 2010s by far. Never have I ever cried about TV Series characters , but this series did. So well written. Every character is fleshed out to the bone. So, thank you Vince Gilligan. Thank you for caring enough that we poured your soul into this and made it an absolute blast. Thank you for inspiring me and thank you for these beautiful memories. The slow build up of story, wonderful acting, good direction, all combined made it very enjoyable to watch! The rise and fall of an amazing journey. Absolute must watch. Perfect TV show in my opinion. Not a wasted episode. Watched it 3 times, gets better with time. Absolute masterpiece! In the past two years, I have binged many TV shows. (Mad Men, The Sopranos, Deadwood, Twin Peaks, The Wire, Six Feet Under, The Twilight Zone etc. etc.) I'm always watching something, new or old. And the show that started it all was Breaking Bad. This is the show I always come back too every year. Right now I am currently re watching it for the 3rd time and I've finally come to the conclusion that this is the greatest show of all time. Why is it so amazing?<br/><br/>The characters. Walter White and Jesse Pinkman are two of the greatest TV characters ever conceived. they're both really strong and well developed characters. Walter at the start of the series has a heart like Mr Rogers and then he slowly evolves into Scarface as the series progresses. Walt always ropes Jesse into doing his dirty work, making his life horrible as the days go by.<br/><br/>This series to me has NO BAD EPISODES and NO BAD SEASONS. I could recount the plot for every episode of this show if I wanted to. 3rd time watching already and this show has never bored or failed to disappoint me once. The show gets better every season. The characters get stronger every season.<br/><br/>The Acting in this show is phenomenal. Bryan Cranston's performance as Walter White is one of the greatest performances ever. Anna Gunn's convincing performance as Skylar White, what else is there too say, she's one of TV's greatest b*tch characters. Aaron Paul's presence in the series. It's just one great blend.<br/><br/>This series is as addictive as the blue meth in the show. It always keeps you engaged and will always push the limit. Breaking Bad is the greatest TV show ever made. If you haven't seen it, it's never too late. In preparation for El Camino the new Breaking Bad Film I have started watching Breaking Bad and I have now finished the first season of the show and really enjoyed it. The premise of the show sees a Chemistry teacher diagnosed with terminal cancer, in order to get money for his family he teams up with a partner to sell Meth. Bryan Cranston relaunched his career in the role of Walter White and he is absolutley amazing in this show, he has so much acting ability it is scary. You will care about Walter and his plight and even though he is doing bad things you totally understand why he is doing it. Aaron Paul plays his partner Jesse Pinkman and he is fantastic as well, their chemistry together is off the charts and it is so entertaining to watch these two work together. The rest of the cast all do a great job, I really liked the character of Hank who is Walter's brother in law and happens to be a DEA agent hunting him down. All the family were entertaining and all the drug dealers provided some extra quality to the show. The story is great, showing the lengths that this average guy will go too make sure his family is okay and seeing how he adapts to this situation. However, this season is a bit open ended and ends quite abruptly. The script is great, it has amazing drama in it with some real intense acting and the humour when it is used really does work and adds extra layers to these characters. The style of the show is very unique and seeing the way the drug trade is presented in this show it feels very real and like this show could exist in the real world. Overall this was a fantastic first season and I can't wait to watch more of the future seasons. The feelings you get from watching this for the first time are some feelings you will never feel again. It is like playing Minecraft for the first time, or playing Classic WOW back in the old days. It is like watching Avatar or Pulp Fiction for the first time, it is comparable to the early GOT seasons.<br/><br/>The only thing that was a little bit odd was the ending. However, it was still good and i loved the entire series, sad that it was over.<br/><br/>What a masterpiece. I've never written a review, but HAD to say something about this 10/10 series. I'm 65 years old and hearing about a show about making & trafficking in Crystal Meth was certainly not something I was going to condone or watch...even if it DID get all 10-star ratings, damnit!! ...until I was challenged to just watch the first episode.<br/><br/>Bam! I was blown away by the opening scene and couldn't believe I was hooked so fast. This series is drama/comedy/suspense all in one. With superb writing like this (in every single episode), it will be very difficult to be surpassed in its entirety. Then, you have a cast of characters so perfectly chosen that you become truly invested in their lives...all the good and bad.<br/><br/>Best series I've ever seen and will probably ever see. I've waited long enough now to watch it all over again; which I'm starting today. And CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEW MOVIE! People think the producers shouldn't mess with it, but I totally trust them because they sure as hell wouldn't do anything to taint their masterpiece series! -Describe Breaking Bad in one word.
Masterpiece<br/><br/>I mean, MY GOD, after GOT is over I can confirm that this show is the best ever created.
Every character in this show is very well developed, the script, the tension, I mean EVERYTHING is perfect.
Basiclly, the meaning of this show, according to the creator, Vince Gilligan, is ,,the transformation of Walter White from Mr Chips to Scarface". And they've done it, just like that<br/><br/>I liked all of the episodes, there's none of them weak, all are great in their way
,,What is the best episode in Breaking Bad?"
Well, in my opinion, the best episode in Breaking Bad needs to have: tension,emotion, shock and other things.
The one with the most tension is Crawl Space
The one with the most emotion is Felina
The one with the most shock is Dead Freight
Putting ALL of this together, you get Ozymandias<br/><br/>
I recommand to all of those who didn't try it yet. You won't regret it. This is the best series , you will see in the world Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul's portrayal of Walter White and Jesse Pinkman will go down in history as some of the best! My review is simply: this show is phenomenal and I highly recommend anyone to watch it, it is most certainly worth it! No words can describe the greatness of this show
After watching it you will wish to lose your memory to watch it all over again and enjoy it's greatness Well to honest, I m feeling I m also a met-head, but not high due to meth.... I m high just because I saw myself "Breaking Bad"
Would love to watch it at least 10 times more...
Feel like I m living in this character.... Ohhh God The best TV show I have watched so far.
Number one in any rating articles, magazines, or videos and it is number one in my opinion.
highly recommended. All I can say there will never be another show like breaking bad.. This is by far my favorite television show ever. Gets you hooked and can't stop watching it. Literally when I finished the last episode I cried and had to start over because I literally missed the cast. Such great acting and storyline is top notch. It's awesome it's not bothering me if watching all day Absolutely amazing TV Show. From Character development, story, act ...
Everything is awesome. The Best TV Show of all time for me ! Until the last season GoT was at least at the same high level, but now Breaking Bad is again on the top alone. Every time I watch the show I feel like a new show or I feel like in my life I had some new startup.. never get bored a single second... The best
No. 1
The best
With reality
Fancy nobody
Summary Not rubbish Not watery. Speachless, Just Speachles.Litrelly the Top Notch Series I have eva seen ðŸ’¯ Just finished to watch it for the third time.
Nevertheless, it still shocks me.
A MASTERPIECE Very exciting and fun tv-serie! Keeps you entertained throughout the whole serie! Mind blowing Show. Every episode stuns you. The production, direction, acting skills, and the sound effects are all excellent. About 60 Episodes but I want more of themðŸ˜‰ Breaking Bad is as close as you can get to a perfect TV show. The story, the acting, the characters, the directing and editing, the cast... Everything is done with such care and attention to detail that it catapults it past any show past or present. Can't recommend it enough and a must see in my opinion. Few films and TV series gets me hooked at its first second. But that was the case with "Breaking Bad", as the camera zooms out, showing our main character Walter White standing in a New Mexican desert in tighty whities, a German 80s  stash, and a gun, they had my interest. And the ride I was in for. Vince Gilligan's masterpiece combines dark humor, massively thrilling plot twists, emotional weight, and superb acting. The result? The closest thing to perfection I've ever witnessed, films included. The character development of the "Breaking Bad" is out of this world, and that's not the case for Walter White - played flawlessly by Bryan Cranston - only. The individual arcs for each character, Aaron Paul's Jesse Pinkman, Anna Gunn's Skylar White, Bob Odenkirk's Saul Goodman, Dean Norris' Hank Schrader, you name it, are so fleshed out with no details left out. And the series' use of allegory, minimalistic symbolism, and themes never fall in any cliche traps, instead adding to the show's unique atmosphere, making it the best thing ever produced. All hail "Breaking Bad", king of kings. Anyone who says Breaking Bad isn't the best show ever hasn't seen it. I dont think any show could ever top this one. Perfect in all ways OMG IT SOOO GOOOD 11/10 I LOVE IT !!! This show is just great. It got pretty much everything right. The characters are great and so are the actors. Aaron Paul and Bryan Cranston are just so wonderful like they were born to act together. All the other actors are amazing as well. Anna Gunn plays Skyler White so well you forget that she is acting. I developed feelings for all the characters and just wanted to know what's next for them. The story comes to end nicely and is quite satisfying in my opinion. I could go on but yeah you get the point. This show is a masterpiece. So if you haven't seen it just go and enjoy this great show. For God sake, I tried to find an episode that is not interesting and boring. And I failed. Well written story with fantastic Actors gives us this incredible show. Best show ever, the whole Dram scenes were Just Great. It begins Boring of course, in season 1,2 I saw many Boring scenes. But after that it shows you how great this show is. Never stop watching till the end. All I'm saying is FeLiNa. This story really like be a real profesional making crystal meth...and all actors are perfect for the story...<br/><br/>this is the best serie that i ever seen, after he, im now active on watching series like this one... Greatest show of all time!!!!! Great acting, great music, great plot lines The greatest show of all timeThe greatest show of all timeThe greatest show of all time BB is an absolutely outstanding TV show, that I've finished watching 4 times completely through, from the 1st episode to the last. And I will definitely come back to it after some time again!
The story is not just catchy and extremely interesting with every episode, but also completely thought through. Every decision that the characters do or decisions they make, will definitely have consequences later on, I mean nothing happens without a reason - it is perfectly written. The outstanding transformation of the main character Walter White to Heisenberg during 5 seasons is just brilliant. Your opinion on this character (and not just him) may change with every couple of episodes. You sympathize with Walt in the beginning and can understand his motivations, but later on, when he develops into a literal monster, you just feel disgusted with him. After seeing how he cares for his family, and even Hank and Jesse, whom both turned on him (and both probably with a good reason), and he still tries to save both of them, you just start to feel a bit sympathy for him again. At the end when everyone abandons him and he atones himself, I just couldn't hold my emotions. Just felt very sorry for him again.
All of the actors played their roles marvelously and music choices were perfect and always fit the mood at the screen.
Beside all of that, this show is very credible and mostly reflects real life - Vince Gilligan just made a perfect reflection of how difficult it gets when you're looking for "the easy way of getting money". So much suffering, violence, uncertainty, fear for life, loss of close ones and unexpected circumstances around you. How frustrating it is, until you actually achieve something, in this "profession".
I personally loved that Walt's former intention (until he became Heisenberg) to sustain his family after his death and leave some money, escalates in the worst possible ending - he looses his family - because of his own choices and he must endure the repercussions alone.
My personal absolute favorite show so far, definitely a must watch :) Breaking bad has some of the best characters in tv history, a unique and exciting story, and amazing acting that all go together to create this memorable and fantastic show that you should watch immediately. I heard from many people that it was a amazing serie but i did not watched it at first till watchmojo uploaded a video with as subject top 10 worst things walter white has done with in a couple of days i finished watching it season 1 was a bit boring but after that it got perfect my order for all season

Breaking Bad LACK OF EPISODE'S OR SEASONS!<br/><br/>There are many TV Series that ain't this good but they have SEASON 6+
Why stop at SEASON 5? You're wasting this!!! The best TV show i've ever seen by far!
Every episode was something special for me. A great show will not repeate a great story from a teacher to a drug cook into a person who ended up his life because of his family who wanted to protect her, thank you, Brian, for all she gave you great I love it so Much. And the Even nailed the ending. TV shows gradually has a way dropping out of the story line or the direction as the show progresses, but breaking bad never went into that phase. It is best complete and perfect TV show that you will ever see from start to finish. Might feel like dragging at some time, but it's totally worth it. Greatest Tv Show I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Thanks for being the greatest characters in the world. This show is a masterpiece, there will be no show like breaking bad. This show is just so amazing. People who rate it bad are clearly not getting the depth of this show. I literally binged this show one episode after the other with my boyfriend the past week and it's got me seriously hooked. It's so funny and yet sad at the same time, and those two elements are hard to write well but the writers did a phenomenal job with it. The aspect of character arcs is amazing in the show. Every character changes, goes through hard times and difficult choices.<br/><br/>One of my personal favorite things about this show besides the writing is how funny it is. I die at the parts where Jesse insults Walt (he's this old man getting insulted by a younger dude it's too funny) and where characters have silly interactions. I really felt for Walt in this show.<br/><br/>Also, cast couldn't have been better chosen. Everyone fits their roles so well its uncanny. You have to watch this show! If you haven't seen it yet you need to.
It is a well write story and awesome director's I watched Breaking Bad in 2014. When Im watching, sometimes I was bored because Walter's changing is goes slowly but good and detailed. This TV series with action, drama, camera and casts deserving 10 point Best show ever it's so good I pooped myself multiple times while watching I think the best thing about this show was the fact that people are who they are because they live in a nice environment surrounding by easy and calming circumstances but once bad things start to happen people will uncover their true identity. The start may be slow, but it is justified and this is to build a good character, Outstanding acting performance from all actors without exception, The credit is of course due to the creator.
Breaking Bad We may not see him anymore I started watching these TV Series very reserved. I don't like generally movies/stories about drugs, drug dealers etc. I just started it because I've heard from friends of mine that it is amazing show. I saw the rating here in IMDB. And oh, well, I decided to give it a try. That was one of my best decisions I've ever made! This show touched me so deeply! This TV Show really changed my mind forever. Some of the lines of the characters were very therapeutic for my emotional problems. This is a cinematic masterpiece I will rewatch many times! Breaking bad is a perfectly narrated history about a science teacher who becomes the king of a drug empire, one thing look far away from another, but the evolution of the character is so slow and real that is imposible not to belive it #BreakingBad
Every action has reaction and smtyms you don't have any redeem for it, that exact happened with Mr. White. I jst finished the whole seasons ,I recommend u watch the whole seasons don't cut off till the last episode come.
Mr.White his bro-in-law lst thr lives This TV Show is The Definition of Perfect
Number 1 Very nice and beautiful and I love it when it comes to end Not even a word! Absolutely 10 out of 10. Best series of all time. The best series ever, you can see it from everywhere from the acting performance from the writers also from the directors, Breaking Bad is the best TV show series of all time you have to watch it This has to be the best show, ever... The plot is incredible and scenes are excelent. The only thing that could top the story are the actors' performances... Overall it is a must-watch if you really want to know what an excelent TV show looks like... This the greatest Tv show ever don't come at me with GoT or the sopranos or any other Tv show this is just the greatest Tv show the way it starts and how it's plot and it's progression is just insane and with such a low budget as well every character has its own arc walt sky jesse mike Saul walt jr they all did an excellent job on this show and the way it ended was so perfect that you didn't ask for more episodes or more information because your satisfied and amazed and shocked how the show ended and a final thank you to Vince Gilligan his writing and characterization is just great thanks to the whole cast and crew members for this great piece of art that is breaking bad It's clear now After watching game of thrones season 8, Breaking bad is THE best TV show that was ever made ...<br/><br/>Watch this to grow old with Walter white .. it's Epic. The series endwell Can't wait for movie to see what happened for walter white and jesse pinkman Loved this show. The first episode with a middle aged man in underwears in the desert I was going to give up. But I didn't and I loved this show. This is the best show ever made! Everything is perfect, this is what masterpiece looks like!!! Thank you!!!!!!! Actors are perfect! Characters are amazingly developed, camera work is great, colors, every details matters! The story is brilliant! I just have no words to describe how much I love this show! 6 years after the final season I decided to watch Breaking Bad. Wow! This is a near perfect show with phenomenal acting by Bryan Cranston and others portrayed in a well sophisticated and jaw dropping manner. I could go on and on about this show, but like I am telling others that have never watched this show...WATCH BREAKING BAD! You will not be disappointed! Beautiful creation. So real !!! It is as real as looking into a live camera. This is a must watch for everyone. The story,the location,the screenplay,the cast everything was perfect. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul were excellent playing Walter White and Jesse Pinkman. Apart from them,Saul Goodman was my favorite character. Gustavo Fring was also an entertaining character. Character development was excellent. You can't root for a single character throughout the series.
It kept me engaged till the finale.
There is nothing to complain about. It won't disappoint you. It's got the thrill,the drama and sarcasm. Trust me,it's worth the hype. It's a gem. The show itself could be methamphetamine. What's left to say, stunning series!! Filled with the feeling of 'oh my god, what would you don't moments. Character design which beats any other show. 10/10 all the way. Walter White character is way above all 😍 direction screenplay everything is just 100% perfect I could write a thousand words to express how perfect this series is and it would never be enough. I can't believe I'm done with it and I'm writing these words with wet eyes.
I laughed, I grieved, I celebrated, I panicked, I clapped, I sighed, I shouted, I whispered and God, I never felt attached to anything as I did with Breaking Bad; The details, the characters, the performance, the quotes, the dispersed dots and the feelings of satisfaction and thriller I felt while connecting them together. I'll miss everything about it.
There wasn't, isn't, and won't be another show as this, never! B.B. is by far the best TV series in the history. Watched it second time, and it trully impressing.
Congrats to everyone involved in making this masterpiece. The best TV show ever created. It's everything you hope it is and more. So smart, so groundbreaking, so emotional. Truly the best in every way. This series is slightly better then GOT in many aspects one of which is it have less character and the story is Based upon a Single Character and a chain is being followed here and if you talk About GOT they have one bit in westeros and the mext bit in winterfell so you miss somethings if you loose a slight concentration but in case of Breaking Bad you never muss anything at all. I have a confession too they have one episode where he was just catching a fly which was boring. I hope this review will help you and watch Breaking Bad if you have not watched it yet. Although late to start watching this series, after having read the multitude of praise and high scores for it i decided to set aside my reservations on the premise, and just dive in. And now i am writing this review after viewing the first two seasons...<br/><br/>Firstly i will start with the positive: Really fantastic acting, and there is without a doubt a completely professional team behind the creation of this series.<br/><br/>Now for the bad: It is very slow paced indeed. And with the sparse comedic moments and the constantly serious themes that are the underlying backbone for this show, it makes for some very miserable viewing. What i would compare this to, is like reading a somewhat interesting article, where it is formatted in just one very very very long unbroken paragraph with no gaps or light at all. So the end result is that it teases you to keep watching, but it's almost tortuous to get through. And it doesn't ever leave you feeling properly "entertained".<br/><br/>Although first impressions from the synopsis might leave people suspecting it is still probably mainly a male-orientated action series. Mark my words, it is not. It actually has more akin with being a very dark soap-opera of sorts. And thus i would personally be far more likely to recommend it to female colleagues and friends rather than any male ones.<br/><br/>Perhaps indeed the serious themes of the series mean that it must continue to be the way it is... without any glorification aspects at all. But when to the viewer, the almost constant misery far outweighs any of the rewards gleaned by the storyline and characters. Then there is little or no actual enjoyment to be garnered. And therefore this series ends up just holding too little in the way of actual entertainment value. It is a times interesting, but ultimately and unfortunately it is also for the main part quite depressing. It seems to me that everyone loves this show on here, but I can't be the only one who sees big problems with Breaking Bad. First of all, how can anyone possibly think this show has great writing!? I have to admit that the first season had promise and I thought it could and should get better with the second season, but it turned out I was way off. Every single character is a stereotype! I'll start with the "bad guys". Tuco and his cousins? What is that!? Tuco's acting and actions are way over the top to be anywhere close to being believable. As for his cousins.. every time they came on screen, I just wanted to laugh out loud with how ridiculous and cheesy they were(lol at the dragging the axe scenes straight out of a horror B-movie). Gus anyone? Another way over the top stereotype of a business-man/gangster character who you want to punch in the face to get that stupid look off his face. The "good guys" are not much better. Starting with Pinkman and his unbelievably stupid actions and arguments with Walt that make absolutely no sense and seem to be put in there to make some sort of suspense between the characters. Although Hank is getting more interesting as the seasons go on, in the first 2 seasons though he was somewhat of a comic relief type with jokes that failed miserably. Now we have Saul replacing him, who's failing even worse. Skyler is just very annoying. Another thing to be seen across the reviews is good acting. I'm sorry I just don't see it, excluding Bryan Cranston/Walter White. Who is the only interesting character that made me watch 3 seasons of this ridiculous over the top storytelling and acting. ...and found out the truth. The premise of the show is stupid, the characters act in idiotic, stereotypical fashion, and the plot is predictable. <br/><br/>I don't find the Mr. White character believable at all. We are supposed to believe that this man, aged 50 in 2008 America, knows nothing about illegal drug dealing. Nothing. Mr. White is an educated man, with at least a Masters degree in chemistry. He has been teaching at the secondary school level for a long time. Yet, he is in such terrible financial straights that he works in a CAR WASH? Seriously, don't the producers of the show understand the salary of a teacher with up to 20 years on the job is? Lets just say its better than average. And if a teacher needs extra cash, they usually have no trouble doing double duty at school, or teaching as an adjunct at a college. The show never explains why he needs tons of money all of a sudden. Ever hear of LIFE INSURANCE? A man in his great physical condition and occupation would have no trouble buying a half million dollar term life policy. As far as the cooking of meth goes-What does he need with a loser dealer? His ONLY problem is selling the meth. Period. You're telling me that an above average intelligence teacher can't cook meth on his own? Can't figure out a safe place to do it? All he has to do is cook up a good supply, which according to the show takes a day or two to cook up the epic batch in episode 1, then shut down the lab and sell his supply. Easy. Granted, selling it would be difficult for him, but he has a DEA brother in-law, how hard could it be? DEA agents are notorious for taking bribes, and his blowhard in-law would easily be susceptible. The whole premise of the show is crap.<br/><br/>There are no surprises so far. Two episodes in, and its boring me already. When there is little criticism of a show and tons of fanboy's proclaiming it to be 'the best t.v. show ever' constantly, then the show is in all probability mediocre, with a cult following. Breaking Bad has no suspense, little character development, uninteresting characters and a dismal beginning-all the things quality TV shows are about. I could go on, but I think you get my point. And don't dismiss me the usual way by saying, 'some people just don't get it'. No, the truth is the majority don't get 'it'. They never do. Most people never think critically. Most people jump on whatever bandwagon everyone else is on, whether it is TV shows, sports teams, or politics/religion.<br/><br/>I was hoping Breaking Bad would be something I could get into, but it turns out to be another disappointing time waster. You'd think I would learn by now that pop culture just isn't interesting to the diminishing minority of us who use the grey cells more than the average Americanus Boobus. Please, if you read this, and you have a discriminating taste in entertainment, I urge you to not even start Breaking Bad. (No spoilers ahead, as I do not discuss content in this review)<br/><br/>The quote in my headline is from "Family Guy", so it might not be based on a serious analysis, but it pretty much represents the opinions I hear from friends and colleagues. Maybe I liked different things about "The Wire" than others. <br/><br/>"The Wire" was one of the, if not the most authentic TV series I have ever seen. I could understand the character's decisions because the creators put much energy into drawing them and their backgrounds. Even if a character did something I considered to be immoral, I was able to understand why he did it based on his social background, key experiences and so forth.<br/><br/>Walter White on the other hand is just an Asshole. In the first season I understood, why he started it all, but from the second season on, it was just his greed he followed. The creators intended to show the path of a righteous man towards a major criminal, but for me this evolution is too artificial and not really thought through. <br/><br/>It's not that I studied psychology or sociology, I only read several books and articles, which makes me slightly more knowledgeable than average at best, but I can emphasize with people and try to set myself into their position to understand their behavior. In "Breaking Bad" I mostly thought: "OK so the creators make him do this or experience that, so they can explain why he then behaves like this or says that" but it was never like "oh, I would have totally done the same thing if I would have been him". Instead I mostly disliked the main characters, especially "Walter White".<br/><br/>I also repeatedly raged about the illogical dialogs. The characters seem to be incapable of verbally resolving conflicts in their relationships. And I mean every single character. Humanity cannot be that stupid.<br/><br/>Another thing, that bugged me about this series was the picture of manhood that has been portrayed or better propagandized (I hope that is the correct word). This is something I find very annoying about a lot of TV series currently aired. Be it "Game of Thrones", "Mad Men", "Vikings", "Boardwalk Empire", "Sons of Anarchy" etc. Series like "Weeds" or "Six Feet Under" did a much better job regarding this issue. <br/><br/>But what really scares me about this fact, is that all these series had been most likely shown to test audiences and have been obviously received positive feedback. This means that series mostly intended to be watched by a male audience have to represent this macho image to be liked by the average American man. It seems to me as if we did not achieved so much in terms of emancipation since women have been allowed to vote. These series became really popular. I get why, it does explore some themes that are trending nowadays, with envolving characters that really make you want to know what's next in their story.<br/><br/>But after watching it all I think it was not that good, not to be one of the best rated series of the whole story of televison. You get to the point that you starting watching it just form curiosity, but the story itself is really not that good. It's already famous, to me this is an average TV show. Lack of suspension & excitement, terrible Spanish, non realistic character development and horrible ending. They extend a short story by adding lots of camera details and spinning the story. For DEA character, how can be any DEA agent that much dumb?<br/><br/>It's more like a family TV show, lots of emotional scenes. I'm in the middle of Season 2 right now and I've had major issues with how sloppy this show can be sometimes. Witness: 1. Jesse is busted by the DEA and then released when they apparently have nothing on him. But wait--the DEA SHOWS HIM that they've found his duffel bag full of money, which was in his car, which was with Tuco when he was shot. Jesse says it isn't his, obviously... but his prints would be all over it (first thing they'd check), and I'm no lawyer but it seems that a sack full of money with your prints all over it found next to a dead drug kingpin would be PLENTY of evidence to charge you with a serious crime. But no, there's no indication that they finger printed the money, and Jesse's let go. NOPE, not buying it.<br/><br/>2. When Jesse tries to cook meth using Walt's recipe, he doesn't get it exactly right--the stuff he makes is very good, but not great, so what does he do but THROW IT OUT IN THE DESERT. Again, the stuff he makes on his own is excellent, he's got no other income, but instead of selling it and working on the formula he just repeatedly tosses it out. We're supposed to believe that this broke meth head has suddenly become as obsessed with perfection as a German luxury car engineer? 3. Let's run down the list of reasons Hank should suspect Walt of being involved with meth. Chemistry equipment used to make meth is known to be missing from the lab Walt supervises... There is apparently a new expert chemist manufacturing meth in the area... Walt is a known associate of Jesse, whose car was found next to a dead meth kingpin... Walt went missing at exactly the same time Hank raided a meth distributor's hideout... Walt is known to have cancer and faces an uncertain financial future... Walt is missing for hours at a time without a good explanation... COME ON. We're supposed to believe that this high-ranking DEA agent hasn't had the thought cross his mind once? Sorry, not buying it.<br/><br/>It's a great show for a lot of reasons, but sloppy stuff like this means it can't measure up to shows like the Sopranos or the Wire, which are meticulously detailed and eminently plausible. That's my two cents. After Deadwood came to a close I pretty much decided there was no need to keep my television. Only the Dynamic Duo of Stewart and Colbert saved it. Then came Breaking Bad; or what I call 'life after Deadwood'. There is no need for me to wax on about this series. All the fans already know, and anyone with even reasonable taste who happens to stumble across an episode will immediately recognize the quality of the writing, performing, directing, lighting and whatever else it takes to create such a classic series. When I saw first Brian Cranston playing the father I thought the series was doomed. I only knew the guy from Malcolm, where he was entertaining and displayed excellent comic chops but, hey what did I know? I have never been so happy to be revealed as clueless. Cranston is amazing. His metamorphosis from passive aggressive husband/father to hardcore meth God is the meat of the series. But everyone is excellent. My only complaint has been in the last season. The cartel assassins are a little bigger than life, IMO, and it sort of changes the tone of the show. But that's a minor complaint. Others have already written plenty about this show, and much better than I could. So I'll leave the in depth analysis to the pros and close by simply saying 'watch it!'. "Best show on television" is not hyperbole. Keep seeing this series recommended over and over and just... why. just watch the first two seasons... similar to mad men, and sons of anarchy... good at first but then borrrrrriiiiing. the one consistent thing is Cranston's acting. other than that, how can i describe it? oh yeah, overrated. Sorry? 9.6 rating? Better than Game of Thrones, Suits and other great T.V shows.<br/><br/>There isn't a single main Character that I liked apart from Jesse. Walt is an utter @sshole and if the main guy who you're supposed to be connecting to makes your skin crawl every time you see him, how are you supposed to enjoy this series.<br/><br/>He makes out like he's cooking for his family but is he really? He worked out in the car he needed 370k for his family before he died yet at the end of the 5th season before most of it gets taken he has 80million, that isn't for his family he's just greedy. He doesn't think about anyone but himself, will kill anyone to keep himself safe.<br/><br/>and as the title says people saying comedy can't think of a time I laughed once other than when I laughed at the annoying acting of walt Jr. and that's no disrespect to the disabled. I now watch the third season to waste time and am amazed how this got it high rankings. It has been nothing but, killing, drug dealing, drug usage, deaths, overdoses, orphans, stealing, lying, diseases, depression, stress, fighting, injustice, scamming, murdering and massive disasters, divorce, therapy, rehab, cancer, peoples lives get destroyed, No humor, no normal healthy human relations. What is there left, a guy making a drug empire? We have that in Scarface, and it's nothing like this, maybe because it isn't filled with 5 season of bad things happening to everyone involved. It's all just depressing. The acting is good, but the script is just depressing.... I accept this is an awesome Series. But still 9.5/10 is over rated. Brilliant - one of the greatest drama series of all time.<br/><br/>Set in Albuquerque, New Mexico, a chemistry teacher, Walter White (played by Bryan Cranston), is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. By chance he runs into a former student of his, Jesse Pinkman (played by Aaron Paul), who is now a crystal meth dealer. This gives him an idea on how to pay for his medical bills and provide for his family upon his death...<br/><br/>Fantastic series. Starts innocently enough and builds tension and momentum with every episode. So many dangers and hurdles in his path - from small time hoodlums to drug lords, his wife, plus Walter's own brother is a DEA agent!<br/><br/>Also has some great comedic moments (largely provided by Jesse Pinkman) but these become fewer and further between the more into the series you get, as it becomes darker the more you go along.<br/><br/>Great ending, one of the most iconic and poetic in TV history.<br/><br/>Great work from Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul. Good support from Anna Gunn, Dean Norris, Betsy Brandt, RJ Mitte, Jonathan Banks and Bob Odenkirk. Those behind the genius crime series Breaking Bad does everything so well that I simply envy them for being a part of it, every one of them. This production simply stinks of the pleasure of doing good drama, in everything from creating, screen writing, directing, acting and everything else in a drama production. What fun they must have had! And if one can call this humor, has it ever been more black? I don't think I have seen any thing better made for television. Breaking Bad would have been a hit in cinemas. I saw Lars Von Triers five hour with one break movie The Kingdom, and it didn't seem long at all. Watching one whole season of Breaking Bad as a full day cinema session would have been nothing less than just brilliant. Breaking Bad is a show about a man, Walter White, who is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. Walter is a high school science teacher with incredible knowledge about Science, specifically Chemistry. The costs of Chemo Therapy have put his family in a awful financial position. Whilst on a ride with his brother in law, Hank Schrader (Who is also a DEA agent), he notices a former student of his, Jesse Pinkman running away from a drug lab. Walter tracks down Jesse Pinkman and asks if they could be partners in the drug bushiness, where they would produce 'Chrystal Meth.<br/><br/>Once Walter began his drug career, his life went down track. He went crazy with power, began to kill, began to put his family second and himself first, all the while his brother in law was trying to track down Walter himself.<br/><br/>This television show is a once in a lifetime experience. Everything about this show is perfect, the shots are sublime, the story is incredible. Everything is incredible. A must watch. I have watched Breaking bad fully through I think 3 times now and I love it to bits! Breaking bad has very talented actors and actresses and the famous cool camera shots, that I love. Watching every character on the show develop from the beginning is amazing, also the music used in it is perfect, I listen to those songs from it all the time. I even watched Malcolm in the middle because I was so desperate to see Bryan Cranston after the finale... I watched every singe interview with Bryan Cranston, Jonathan Banks, Aaron Paul and also many other actors and actresses from the show.. I did every Breaking bad quiz I found... MAN! I even "studied" the different meanings behind colors and hidden symbols from the show. I was literally obsessed with Breaking bad... It is simply the best TV show to ever appear on our TV screens ever! PS. I probably sound crazy but I promise Im not, Im just a huge fan of Breaking bad. Have a nice day! No review needed, just a short story to persuade you to watch!!<br/><br/>I am one of those lucky people who had never heard of this show during its run, so watched it all in one hit! A guy in work asked if I had seen it and said how amazing it was, which I pretty much ignored, however, within two weeks a further three people all said the same thing to me, "YOU MUST SEE THIS SHOW!"<br/><br/>So I downloaded the first few eps and the wife and I settled down. We were instantly hooked and watched several that night and i downloaded the lot the same night.. we literally watched the entire 62 episodes in about 10-12 nights watching 5 or 6 a night... she would come home from work and without even having tea and say "put another Breaking bad on"..<br/><br/>This was about a year ago, my dad recently heard of it and asked me to download it for him, and I watched ep1 again as a recap and that was that.. I re-watched the entire lot again in about 10-14 nights, as hooked as I was the first time round... <br/><br/>My dad came round the other other night after having seen 4 or 5 eps of S01 and basically just said "WOW, I need more episodes of this asap...".... Basically if you have never seen it, go watch it!! I started watching Breaking Bad in 2011. I found the first season interesting but season 2 became somewhat of a bore and i left midway... DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE.<br/><br/>I gave it a second shot in 2014 and it blew me away. I finished the remaining episodes in a week. The plot, storyline and character development is amazing and the main cast is brilliant!! Bryan Cranston plays a role that makes you sympathize with him no matter what monstrosity he commits but for me the standout was Paul Arron. The way his character changes over the course of the show was something to behold! If you have started watching the show and feel it is a little slow, PLEASE do not give up! It will be worth your while. Its the best show i have watched Breaking Bad is an American crime drama television series created and produced by Vince Gilligan. The show originally aired on the AMC network for five seasons, from January 20, 2008 to September 29, 2013. The main character is Walter White (Bryan Cranston), a struggling high school chemistry teacher who is diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer at the beginning of the series. He turns to a life of crime, producing and selling methamphetamine, in order to secure his family's financial future before he dies, teaming with his former student, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul). The show was set and produced in Albuquerque, New Mexico.<br/><br/>Throughout the series, Walter produces and sells meth to earn money in order to secure the financial future of his family: his wife Skyler (Anna Gunn), and children Walter, Jr. (RJ Mitte) and Holly (Elanor Anne Wenrich). The show also features Skyler's sister Marie Schrader (Betsy Brandt), and her husband Hank (Dean Norris), a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent who is determined to solve the case involving the meth empire. Walter teams up with lawyer Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk), who helps him get into contact with drug kingpin Gus Fring (Giancarlo Esposito). In the fifth season, Walter heavily involves himself with Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks), Todd Alquist (Jesse Plemons) and Lydia Rodarte-Quayle (Laura Fraser).<br/><br/>In 2014, Breaking Bad entered the Guinness World Records as the highest rated show of all time. In the beginning indeed a bit slow, but keep watching because it's definitely worth it. The actors did a great job, i was just amazed by the work of Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul. After finishing an episode you just cannot wait 'til the next episode. And every episode is fun from the beginning until the end, there are no boring moments. Following the life of a chemistry teacher that turns into a bad-ass meth cook just doesn't get boring. I give this series a 10/10 because it's just flawless. I would recommend everyone to watch it, but keep in mind that there are some disturbing moments, viewer discretion is advised. Amazing series. The reader's opinions are spot on. But, all viewers need to accept that 'Breaking Bad' is pure entertainment ... not a morality play or the balance of good over evil. Greed, avarice, and moral voids are part of all human life. That, in itself, is what makes this one of the best (if not the best) of American crime series in the 21st Century. Just as Forbrydelsen (Danish) and The Killing plowed new fields, so is 'Breaking Bad'. Breaking bad - Especially our ongoing 'war on drugs' adds a special cachet to the stories. All future US crime / drug / action / justice - including crime and punishment genres will be judged by this marvelous series. Wonderful ... we will not miss one episode ... and we live in Asia. We love it. Better than 'The Wire,' 'The Shield,' or The Sopranos. We can only hope that they find a way to to approach the production values of Breaking Bad in future efforts. Not to be missed - excellente! We watched the entire 5 seasons over about 2 months.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it immensely. <br/><br/>Some parts are hard to watch - it's not for everyone, but it's funny, sad, disturbing, believable and really original.<br/><br/>The acting is incredible and Bryan Cranston thoroughly deserves every award he has won for Breaking Bad.<br/><br/>I've never watched a series where I've changed my feelings so much against main characters before, the character development is brilliant.<br/><br/>I don't think they'll ever make a series as good as this! I strongly recommend you give it a go! Every time I think about Breaking Bad or watch any of the last 3 episodes I feel like my hypothetical wife of ten years was R***d and K****d in front of me. im exaggerating a tad so plz don't be hateful. but my point is I get emotional and cry about every time. i had a 6 year relationship with this show. i watched the Pilot episode the day it aired and the never missed one episode NO JOKE! no show in the past or present is like they never existed so to speak. i mean they don't compare and i cant see how any shows in the future could trump the power this one had to captivate an audience. i hate to speak ill of this show but what im about to say is more of a pro than a con but the only episode that i disliked mostly was the fly episode where walt and jessi done nothing but try to catch that stupid fly. it was sort of a funny episode and a secret was almost revealed but that was it. so out of the 60+ episodes only one was kind of boring. 10/10 still. love it will always love it and plan to watch the entire series annually i done every season leading up to the next just before the new season would begin I'd watch the ones before to catch up. i done this for 5 years so needless to say i know this show very well. This show is the greatest show I have ever seen. I'm not much of a TV- series fan but this one's mind-blowing. The plot is great. You'll never know what happens next. Acting is superb. There's isn't even one person in this series with poor acting. <br/><br/>The thrill is always nearby. I couldn't stop watching this TV-series. It was the most addictive thing I've ever seen on television.<br/><br/>Recommend this to EVERYONE!!!<br/><br/>This pitch-black comedy drama series is fantastic. The relations between the different characters are stunning. The creators of Breaking Bad have done a extraordinary job creating something that reaches all the way to the audience. I'm not sure what to write about "Breaking Bad." It's probably the most amazing series I've ever seen, and I've loved several series over the years. But Breaking Bad is totally different from any of them.<br/><br/>It's totally addictive - the story of a high school teacher who finds out he has cancer and, to provide for his family in the future, turns to making meth. He's a chemist, so his stuff is purer than anything out there and is the color blue, so soon, everybody wants the blue meth.<br/><br/>What makes the show so fascinating is the evolution of the main character, Walter White, played by Bryan Cranston. Bryan Cranston is so good it hurts. He completely inhabits Walter. Walter starts out as a teacher and becomes more and more corrupt and desperate as time goes on and he enters the drug world. Soon he can lie and kill with the best of them and not bat an eyelash. The question is, was he always this way and his work with meth just brought it out? Or was he a nice guy corrupted by money and power? Or did he just start piling lie upon lie and had to protect himself? Because there's no question that Walter becomes a terrifying person.<br/><br/>The answer, I think, is in Walt's past. A brilliant man who had a chance at a being involved in an enormous business but gave it up. In other words, he's a loser, with a formidable talent going into teaching school. He gets the power and money and they become more powerful drugs than the meth. They tell him that at least he is somebody at last.<br/><br/>Walt's relationships suffer too. He has a wife, Skyler (Anna Gunn), and a son (R.J. Mitte) with cerebral palsy, a new baby, a brother-in-law (Dean Norris) in the police force and a sister-in-law (Betsy Brandt) with whom he and his wife spend a lot of time. And more than that, Walt has a partner Jesse (Aaron Paul), a former pupil of his, with whom he has an uneasy relationship that grows worse and worse as time goes on.<br/><br/>The atmosphere of the show is intense, epitomized by the brutal heat of Albequerque in which the characters often find themselves. The suspense and tension throughout is nerve wracking. And then there are the shocks. The scream out loud moment occurs when Gus Fring (Giancarlo Esposito) exits a room in a nursing home. That's all I say.<br/><br/>The acting - well, it's absolutely tremendous from every single person. Bob Odenkirk, who plays Walt's attorney Saul Goodman, actually has a spin off series, so popular was his character. Anna Gunn goes from a pregnant, relaxed wife, to a wreck. R.J. Mitte, who has a mild form of cerebral palsy in his real life, is wonderful as Walt Jr., who likes to be called "Flynn." To see their love turn to hate was really something.<br/><br/>Aaron Paul is magnificent - in fact, it was decided not to kill off the character on the strength of his performance. He's a no-nonsense guy who does drugs and then tries to go clean; he falls in love; he cares about children - he must run the gamut of emotions in the series' five years. His relationship with Walt is sometimes compatible, sometimes antagonist, sometimes dangerous, and often frightening. Aaron is the good guy who does illegal things, but doesn't have Walt's mean streak.<br/><br/>Other standouts: Jonathan Banks as Mike, Giancarlo Esposito as Fring, Dean Norris as Hank, a real pitbull; Betsy Brandt as Skyler's sister and Hank's wife; and everyone else, perfectly cast and excellent in their roles.<br/><br/>There's not much to add except don't deny yourself the opportunity to see this series, so incredibly acted with such a powerful story - about the destructive nature of the drug trade, greed, and what power can do to someone. Just an amazing show. The Breaking bad show has set a trend..this show created history in the TV series world. i have seen many TV-series..popular ones like Dexter, Mentalist, Bones, All started out good and ended a disaster...But breaking bad has never disappointed me.never in one episode..it always set my blood up high..and believe me..not everything impresses me. The character Heisenberg is a Kingpin in drug world..but he is shown like a normal guy..no big deal guy..a powerful guy..feels like a real alive character when all the way you see it..Bryan cranston is perfect match for the charactr..and all the episodes are carefullly written by the master writer Vince gillian..YOU CAN DEFINITELY WATCH IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A PERFECT DRAMA WITH ENERGY..YOU CANT GET BETTER THAN THIS..I TRIED !!! I discovered Breaking Bad this summer and was immediately hooked. This drama is unusual because of the lack of melodrama and a sedate pace which gradually builds up to a climactic crescendo ; there are no emotional pyrotechnics, no over the top performances, just nuanced acting by the cast. Bryan Cranston handles all the subtle shades of his character's persona with a masterful adroitness. The writers must be lauded for writing a complex character like Walter White. This series has an inherent melancholy and its characters seem almost Shakespearean in their emotional spectrum. This series is also a window into the murky underworld of drugs and a cautionary tale about what happens when one gets mired in this world. This final season gives me hope that this is a series that will end before it gets stale or ruined. When I started watching this show I had never thought such a concept would attract me that much but as I watched I thought to myself how could I have missed such a show. It is the best in comparison to any show I've watched. Be it Game Of Thrones or The Wire, this is better. The direction of Vince Gilligan is extraordinary. I love the way he has characterized the people in this show. <br/><br/>Bryan Cranston is a clean winner. However his character may be, he is the best that there is. There is absolutely no comparison in terms of greatness with such a character or actor in the cast. Aaron Paul has done an amazing job as well. He has played the role Jesse as it should have been. You name any character and he/she has done a great job. Giancarlo Esposito is one of the best and baddest villain created. Everyone must definitely watch this show. Every season gets better. "Breaking Bad" is not just any TV Show and calling it such would trivialize such an unbelievable exercise into it's brilliance which personifies the great heights that can be achieved on the small screen. The reason I consider it being under-rated is because it is proving to be leaps and bounds above every other show in it's time (barring Game of Thrones) and it's progression is not merely surprising but awe-inspiring and has not received the praise warranted till very recently.<br/><br/>Created by Vince Gilligan, it tells the story of Walter White, an under-achieving genius chemist who after being diagnosed with cancer that would lead to his inevitable death decides to cook meth to save money for his family once he passed on. What starts out as a sort of "valiant" attempt in taking care of his family, turns into a world which transforms him due to the incidents that befall him during this endeavour. "Breaking Bad" was a very good show in it's first three seasons, but since then it has transformed itself into being one of the greatest and boldest achievements in TV History.<br/><br/>Central to it's brilliance is it's amazing cast. Bryan Cranston, who was best known for being the goofy father in "Malcolm in the Middle" has against all the odds transformed that image to show us the versatility that is as surprising as it is riveting. He is more than ably supported by Aaron Paul and Anna Gunn (who has been at her best in Seasons 4 and 5)who complement the nature of the duplicity that has become a part of Cranston's life. Even though the writing in the show is brilliant, it is the portrayal of the actors of their characters which really brightens the material as they portray their metamorphosis with a brilliant pace and realism which one would not think would be possible (especially from Gunn). Solid supporting performances are provided by Betsy Brandt, Dean Norris and Bob Odenkirk. The most memorable supporting performances however come from Jonathan Banks, Giancarlo Esposito and Mark Margolis, the latter two being awarded deserved Emmy nominations this year.<br/><br/>However, all this would not have been possible had it not been for Vince Gilligan who brings us a world where ordinary people are faced with extraordinary circumstances and their battle to be able to live through them. The show is more of a testament towards survival than anything else and Gilligan's protagonist (White) is central to the vision of his creation.<br/><br/>All that being said, Cranston is it's highlight. His metamorphosis is the testament to what I think is what translates Gilligan's perspective. Season 5 is delving into the aspect even further and his brilliance as a character actor is evolving immensely which carries the show even though he is surrounded by very capable performances around him. <br/><br/>I am saddened by the fact that the show does not have much longer to go, but whatever conclusions do transpire, it was a privilege to see a character who could go toe-to-toe with some of the most memorable TV characters of all time. We are witnessing the rebirth of Bryan Cranston and he is stamping his revival with a show we will never forget. A lot of people are picking up on it recently, if you belong to this crowd at the moment I suggest you join the bandwagon because it is an experience which you will never forget. I just saw episode 3x10 and have only one thing to say: Whuawahua! It's just the best fiction I've seen for years. In France we call cinema the 7th art, in the US it's the industry of entertainment. In most cases, I prefer the American way of saying it. But for this episode, I'm on the French side Imagine the pitch: let's put two guys and a fly in a cave for 50 minutes. Who's crazy enough to accept such a scenario? The actors are so real, so sensitive, so violent and so fragile; I just fell in love with both. I leave next door to Godard, in Switzerland and I'm sure he'd like this challenge: no sex, no violence, no incredible camera effect, no make-up and no tricky scenario: just two guys in a cave with a fly. Only those incredible actors could have made it so tense and beautiful. Please go on! Thumbs up for
<ul><li>certain momentum which develops each character's potential.</li><li>excellent writing</li><li>really blows ur mind by the end of each season</li><li>outcomes of each problem they face is unexpected.</li><li>Walter White, An ex-chem teacher and now drug manufacturer doing literally anything to keep himself in the business and becoming cold-hearted if the situation requires for him so yet a family man and raising no suspicion to his DEA brother-in law.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Jesse Pinkman, being in this business for longer time than walt yet unable to make decisions regarding drug business and prone to emotional attachments and just wanting to be a free family man.</li></ul><br/><br/>only a minor thing i didn't liked personally:
<ul><li>Really slow.... this series does not jump from one situation to another it takes time to build up that momentum and sometimes it just seems like boring. So if u have a choice watching between Breaking bad and Money heist or GOT, go for the other one cos eventually this series initially might bore you up at one point compared to other ones.</li></ul> Bryan Cranston delivers one of the best actor portrayals I have ever seen. Malcom's father no more.
This show is the best show in the "5 seasons and under" category. It starts out with the lead character (Cranston) already in a heap of trouble. You get hooked on episode one.
I wish I could forget everything and watch it over again. From the construction of a drug dealer and former chemistry teacher, to the deconstruction of an drug addicted who never cared for anything but himself into a guy who's tired of being lonely and apart from making some terrible choices, actually have a good heart. This series just overcome all possible expectations and delivers a story that makes you feel sorry for the bad guy without realizing how bad he is.
The chemistry teacher with cancer who wanted nothing but to leave some money for his family becomes the best cooker and biggest dealer in a large perimeter. His partner who showed to be missing some intelligence, by the end becomes as great as him in the cooking, and during the show provides some cleaver moments, which makes you connect with the character.
Walter's whole family falling apart, him making more money than were ever possible to imagine, the connection between him and Jessie, like a father and son(even more solid than he has with his own). It all comes to lock you into this series and it doesn't take much expensive scenes with action and explosions, but a perfect drama and some clever moments. That's when you realize that there are no wasted episodes, they all contribute to the story and make it whole, different than other shows that have so much potencial but insists in maximizing the profit by putting 23 episodes, where maybe 13 could tell much better.
An exemple of perfect storytelling and drama, they build the tension in each moment without fooling you. They make every scene worth it, and in the end, you just feel bad it's over. Everyone should watch this show. Awesome, Amazing. I kept learning how good it was and I kept saying: No thankyou. This is no strange when you find this out at the top five of the highest rated TV series of IMDb. If you go through the whole seasons of Breaking Bad, you'll definitely discover the reasons why people likes this show so much! I'm also not an exception. I was amazed by this excellent show. Though the first two seasons seemed a little bit boring to me, but from the third season I was obsessed with Breaking Bad completely! <br/><br/>And now I'm pretty sure, Breaking Bad is so far one of the best thriller series in the television industry. This is a suspenseful TV show with superb acting from Bryan Cranston, from Malcolm in the Middle, and Aaron Paul. The storyline is great because it is all a huge dilemma in the first couple of seasons for Mr. White because on the one hand he must provide for his family, but on the other he knows what he is doing is illegal and he has never broke the law before. In season two though you clearly see the transformation from someone with this dilemma to someone whose a bad ass. Also it has great writing because it incorporates enough comic relief to make the subject less dark and throws in new characters while still making sense. However, seasons two through three are very slow due to necessary character development that builds up to seasons four through five which are phenomenal with an epic ending that will take your breath away. A TV Series, Breaking Bad won the Golden Globe for Best Television Series, the Primetime Emmys for Outstanding Drama Series, and Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series. <br/><br/>I was getting interested in the show when many sources and critics telling me that it was one of the greatest series of all time. So I started to watch Breaking Bad. The show started slightly slow, but I was certainly hooked by all the characters. All the actors have paid attention to every single detail, putting their own characteristic into every nuance. By season 3, I was addicted to the storyline and cannot stop watching it.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad is about a high school chemistry teacher, Walter White who suddenly finds he is dying for cancer. To leave anything to his family, he teams up with a former student Jesse Pinkman to make and sell methamphetamine. They're so good at it that they become major criminals. <br/><br/>Breaking Bad has brilliant acting, story and direction. It has intrigue, danger and moments of comedy. Every objects, characters and events during 5 seasons are all connected. The intelligence and clue are on dialogue and plot lines. Therefore, you cannot miss a single scene. You can become Sherlock Holmes by watching this series. I really enjoy guessing what Walter and other character's next step will be.<br/><br/>I also love its outstanding camera picture and music editing. It creates a lot of unforgettable moments by using complex angle to shoot. Besides, it displays a lot of symbolic items and colors to show the roles' mentation. Breaking Bad develops its own black humor style. It always uses relaxing music to mix with violent scenes. You will be just astonished by the contradiction of setting.<br/><br/>In my opinion, Breaking Bad is the best television show ever. It has a fantastic ending. It is an unmissable and superb crime drama. Awesome simply awesome. Its the only TV series that I watched twice. The story line is so well built up. The action direction screenplay all top notch. It does not have any super hero kinda thing or something like that but, still the intensity it creates is hands down. While watching it you feel like that these things can actually happen with you. At first u feel like its some boring kinda story but, as u keep watching through all the episodes u simply start loving them. Wow a 10/10 from me. And please a request from me to the producers. Please don't even think of producing a season 6. Its a classic and has the perfect ending for me This is one of the best TV shows ever made in the history of television industry encompassing all genres. Although, this TV show has a lot of crime and drama, some of its dialogues make you laugh more than most of the comedy series in the television industry. Every episode is unique and interesting in this five series TV show. The story moves at a very natural and realistic speed. This is one of the best works by Vince Gilligan till date. Everyone did superb acting especially Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul. Superb dialogues, amazing story and excellent acting make this the best drama TV show.<br/><br/>A must watch for all! To be honest i was not so fond of this show when i started it. I watched the last episode before i finished the first. Everyone was telling me that it was such a good show and that i should keep watching it. So i continued and i fell in love with the show. I watched it a year ago completely and now i am watching it again. The characters are so good and the plot is amazing. This is the best show i have ever seen and i don't think there will ever be a show that will be as good as this one. The first two seasons were not the best but it starts to get really good at the end of the second season. I watched 17 hours of this show in 2 days thats how good it is. If you have not seen this show i suggest you watch it immediately. The best story builds up and characters making that I ever seen. Firstly, I didn't like it too much. I liked it. But not much. But from the fourth season, I was getting interested in it. I really like the way that Vince Gilligan build up the characters as well as the story. It's really seamless. You can't think what's gonna happen next. I really liked it. <br/><br/>And the next main thing is I don't count Walter White as a villain. He is sort of a Hero as my point of view. He is a coward, selfish & A- hole as well. But he is one of my heroes. <br/><br/>Jesse Pinkman is my favorite character along all of them. Because he is the most innocent guy in the entire show. He is trying to keep peace every time. But I really like the dialogs of Saul Goodman. The every single word of this show is from Vince Gilligan's mind. That was remarkable. <br/><br/>The second main thing is the editing style of it. As a video editor, I learned so many things from this. I've watched some scenes again and again. Still, I can watch them. <br/><br/>America is a great country and a Worst country. And my dream country. America is suffering from this kind of diseases. And America helps for those who raised their hands for against them in every possible way. This show = Meth. Its not just a TV show, its an experience. Period. Thats it guys, I have no more to say, I just want to express my feeling about the show because I love it so much that I have to say it out loud. OK I run out of words. All the things I write started from here is just pure rubbish that you and I don't really care as it is meaningless. You can choose to read or not I don't really care because the objective is to achieve 10 lines of text, a guideline is a statement by which to determine a course of action which means that I have to follow it so that I do not break the rules, I hope the admin don't ban me because I lack of the trait of imaginative and English is not my primary language. Wow I already reached 10 lines, thank you. I still want to say that I love Breaking Bad. KThxBye Breaking Bad takes the TV shows to next level 1.Screenplay&Direction:Best. There are some scenes that are technically so sound that you will be amazed.But sometimes the pace is slow but it is worth it 2.Cast&Characterization:It is a perfectly assembled cast.Performances by all the cast is so good especially by Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul, Dean Norris, Bob Odenkirk. The characterizations are awesome. To how much lengths Walter White goes to save his family is simply moving. 3.BGM:In some scenes there is only silence which represents a slow paced scene. Title theme is awesome.4.Story:The plot is the main part of breaking bad that makes it so good. There are no loose ends in the series and no unnecessary sub plots or characters. To sum this up this is a MUST WATCH show for everyone Fantastic show. Everything about it is great. Such an thrilling ride. Most of the time it had me just saying wow that was awesome. If you want to be entertained watch this show. The acting is great all around. Cranston in particular is awesome as Walter White. It is incredible to see Walt transform from a nice guy to the ultimate bad ass. Despite all the things he does you find yourself rooting for him. The show is full of intense moments. So many times I kept thinking how are they going to get through this? I swear every episode ended with a fantastic cliffhanger with me begging for more. The weeks went by very slow. Lucky for people who haven't watched it yet they have every episode available and honestly watching this show from beginning to end the first time is awesome. The tension is great. Also a very underrated part of this show is the humor. Despite being the most tense, dramatic, and dark series out there, in my opinion it is also the funniest. Yeah for me The X-Files is the best show I've seen in my life but Breaking Bad is also awesome (yeah two different genres i know but in their genre this two are the best) As Walter White's drug lord status evolves this show does it too from zero to high hero (!!!) The guy evolves from cooking on a RV to his own lab i mean awesome!!!! No words just awesome and Pinkman is also awesome no wonder why this is in the Guinnes Book of Records as THE BEST SHOW IN TV IN HISTORY...<br/><br/>Honestly watch this show this worths a watch seriously Breaking Bad is the best of the best...<br/><br/>Watch it!!!! Walter White has just turned fifty, he is a teacher whose pupils don't respect and he has just learnt he has terminal lung cancer his life is about to change in ways he couldn't imagine. One day his brother in law, DEA Agent Hank Schrader, invites him to ride along with him during a drugs bust. He tells Walt about the money involved then as the raid happens Walt sees one of his former pupils, one Jesse Pinkman, fleeing the scene. Walt doesn't turn Jesse in, instead he approaches him with a business proposition; Jesse knows people in the drugs business and Walt knows chemistry and needs money to set up his family for after he dies together they will make the best methamphetamine in the American South West! Over five series they will climb to the top of their business but there will be consequences; many people will end up dead including some close to Walt and Jesse and the family that Walt professes to care about will be torn apart.<br/><br/>There have been some great series on television over the last few years and this is one of the best; it takes an unlikely premise and turns it into a drama of Shakespearian proportions. This is down to creator Vince Gilligan's fine storytelling and a fantastic cast. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul are great as protagonists Walt and Jesse but they aren't the only stand out cast members; we have Anna Gunn and RJ Mitte who play Walt's wife and son; Dean Norris and Betsy Brandt as Hank and his wife Marie, Bob Odenkirk as the hilarious lawyer Saul Goodman and Jonathan Banks as the menacing 'fixer' Mike Ehrmantraut to name just a few of this series' great actors. While the story is a drama there are plenty of genuinely funny moments which don't feel overly forced; there are also moments of shocking tragedy. Given its subject matter this series won't be for everybody, and it certainly isn't suitable for younger viewers, but I'd certainly recommend it to anybody who finds the plot description interesting. First of all I am not a fan of TV series , specially if it is like 5 seasons or more. But from the very fist episode of Breaking Bad I knew there is something different in here. The story and dialogue will grip you from the first episode till the end...The Idea is very new , you will be confused with the Walter's personality through the episode.. you don't know whether to agree or disagree with him. the dialogue is brilliant as when you listen you will agree with the ideas in it but it will leave you uncertain about the main concept. I give Walter, Jesse, Hank 10/10, Skyler and Marie 6/10. their performance is not convincing or they set up them like that, I don't know but at least Skyler is better than Marie. The season 5 is best of the best , each move, each word should be studied well. This is an amazing TV series as it is a package : crime,drama,emotions,brains, in short WOW. Walter White is a super intelligent chem teacher who has lived a simple life and has done nothing wrong EVER.Then one day he is diagnosed of lung cancer and he breaks bad.He wants to leave money for his family so he partner up with a former student of his i.e. Jesse Pinkman n cooks meth, which is like the purest anybody have ever seen. In their journey of cooking and selling, they come across extreme situations but always finds a way to snap out of it. Walt's split personality is the X-factor as we never expect a normal guy turn into a high class criminal. It's definitely not for everybody, people who like crime based shows and admire some serious acting will love it. I haven't finished it but the suspense is awesome, the best part is the first scene of every episode, it just makes you wanna not miss any minute of the rest of the episode. You feel attached to the characters not because you are sympathetic but they are actually lovable. Superb acting by Bryan Cranston and that is not at all doubtful but Aoron Paul as Jesse Pinkman is so cute and totally fits in this role. Even if you are not a TV series kinda person, trust me you'll complete this one.It's as addictive as the blue meth of heisenberg ;). I know my review will get lost in the shuffle of the hundreds that have already been posted, but I had to wade in and give my two thumbs up for this epic show. It's fabulously written, directed, produced, and acted. The character development is simply stunning, seizing you by the heart and pulling you right in, leaving you wanting to binge watch episode after episode. The tense action, real-life drama of family, and quirky humor all mesh together so well that you will feel that you know the characters as true as the real world. The show truly is the best one ever made.<br/><br/>Therefore, if you are one of the few who haven't seen Breaking Bad, let me just say that every other show that you choose to watch besides this one (i.e. you keep putting it off) is a lesser show by every measure, for the production quality, acting, and plots are second to none. I highly suggest with no reservation that if you have not seen this, then shame on you. Go seek immediate redemption by starting Breaking Bad now! You will not be disappointed. Breaking Bad is the only piece of watchable media to truly change my opinion on how to critique film and television. it is not only the best written, edited, and directed show, but takes those components to a level of excellence which I thought impossible by the television industry. The acting lead Bryan Cranston is not only worthy of any Emmy or Golden Globe, But of Oscar winning standard. The shows brilliance is also made visually, with beautiful cinematography, colour palette and camera angles. But where Breaking Bad really excels is its characters. How they react, change and deal with problems. this is done in a way only dreamed, let alone performed by any other show-runner and TV writer.<br/><br/>But when i try to recommend Breaking Bad to someone in a way that it is a critical masterpiece, people become hesitant. That is where Breaking Bad is special, it works for both a critics and viewers.<br/><br/>How the almost Comedic sounding "the story of Walter White a high school Chemistry teacher turned drug kingpin" turned into this; i do not know. all i know is that this seemingly innocent 5 season crime drama, has raised the bar for television and has changed the game on every level... Definitely my all time favorite TV-series. It's all you want composed in to one show, it's tragic, extremely full of suspense, has a great plot and is full of dark humor. The characters are spot on, everyone really suits their character and I feel like the show in general is just really raw. If a character feels like crap they look like crap, so there's no excessive make-up and expensive houses, it's just realistic and that makes it so much better as it's easier for the viewer to relate even if the story isn't something anyone relates to at all unless you're Walter White. It's just these small things that you see yourself or someone you know in, because most of what's in this show is things that could happen in real life, which you don't see very often in TV-series.<br/><br/>I've probably recommended Breaking Bad to everyone I know, and I will continue to do so. Everyone who hasn't watched it has missed something exceptionally great. It kind of ruins your hope of ever finding one of those flawless shows that you just can't stop watching, because nothing is as good as Breaking Bad. You need it in your life. <br/><br/>Watch it, you will not regret it. When I rate films or shows on IMDb I rate them on what I think they should be.<br/><br/>My sister got my entire family into Breaking Bad and now I'm hooked on it and I'm only 13!! I have to admit I thought this was highly over rated when I watched the first 2 or 3 episodes, but it takes time for you to get into the characters, and after I did that it was absolutely brilliant!!! I am at the end of S4 and I am extremely enjoying it. Walt/Bryan Cranston plays a PHD Chemistry teacher at a high school and teams up with former student Jesse/Aaron Paul and start to cook meth for his family to get money as he has terminal lung cancer. And that is all I can tell you to be honest!!<br/><br/>Breaking Bad=9/10 Let the words of Sir Anthony Hopkins speak for this TV show. He sent this letter to Bryan Cranston after he finished watching the entire series.<br/><br/>"Dear Mister Cranston.<br/><br/>I wanted to write you this email - so I am contacting you through Jeremy Barber - I take it we are both represented by UTA. Great agency.<br/><br/>I've just finished a marathon of watching "BREAKING BAD" - from episode one of the First Season - to the last eight episodes of the Sixth Season. (Ed note: There are in fact five seasons of Breaking Bad; this might have been wishful thinking.) (I downloaded the last season on AMAZON) A total of two weeks (addictive) viewing.<br/><br/>I have never watched anything like it. Brilliant!<br/><br/>Your performance as Walter White was the best acting I have seen - ever.<br/><br/>I know there is so much smoke blowing and sickening bullshit in this business, and I've sort of lost belief in anything really.<br/><br/>But this work of yours is spectacular - absolutely stunning. What is extraordinary, is the sheer power of everyone in the entire production. What was it? Five or six years in the making? How the producers (yourself being one of them), the writers, directors, cinematographers.... every department - casting etc. managed to keep the discipline and control from beginning to the end is (that over used word) awesome.<br/><br/>From what started as a black comedy, descended into a labyrinth of blood, destruction and hell. It was like a great Jacobean, Shakespearian or Greek Tragedy.<br/><br/>If you ever get a chance to - would you pass on my admiration to everyone - Anna Gunn, Dean Norris, Aaron Paul, Betsy Brandt, R.J. Mitte, Bob Odenkirk, Jonathan Banks, Steven Michael Quezada - everyone - everyone gave master classes of performance ... The list is endless.<br/><br/>Thank you. That kind of work/artistry is rare, and when, once in a while, it occurs, as in this epic work, it restores confidence.<br/><br/>You and all the cast are the best actors I've ever seen.<br/><br/>That may sound like a good lung full of smoke blowing. But it is not. It's almost midnight out here in Malibu, and I felt compelled to write this email.<br/><br/>Congratulations and my deepest respect. You are truly a great, great actor.<br/><br/>Best regards<br/><br/>Tony Hopkins. " yes, it's time to judge my book from it's cover as i've said, there is no show can be better than BREAKING BAD it's the BEST OF THE BEST and i loved it a lot Bryan Cranston & Aaron Paul presents a very beautiful characters and shows us the variety of all personalities from being happy, anger, High, and much more the story is very attractive people, charisma, everything in the show is so adorable and must be loved, scenes, crimes and the music inside are very mysterious and positive to grab your attention to get in the mood and watch all the series in a week without any interruption from anybody even if it's from your work, can't write about the show because if i want to do it then i must have at least a million lines to express the show I'm not lying. This is the greatest show ever created by man. It ended perfectly and did not drag on. The acting is amazing and the characters they play are even better. If you haven't seen this show, just stop. Go to Netflix, your DVR, etc. and just watch it. It will take about a month if you watch about two episodes a night, but it's worth it. Everything about it is just so... awesome. I know you are probably thinking, "Oh everybody has told me about this show, how good can it really be?" It's not going to change your life or anything, so just have no expectations and come in only reading the plot summary. Make sure you watch it, without the feeling that you are being forced to. Do it on your own time without anybody in your ear who has already seen it. It's made to entertain you. If I could I would have given 11 out of 10 since this TV series is so well made that few others series could have been as much entertaining as this one. As a matter of fact Breaking Bad has everything: irony, especially in the first two series the relationship and the situations between Jessie and Walter are amusing, besides some particular characters as Hank and Saul Goodman; the plot is very well developed and compelling since the beginning and in the 4th and 5th series there's a continuous climax and the story line takes an unexpected turn; the characters are psychologically studied in depth through their change from the 1st to the last season; the actors are all great, but Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul deserve a special mention. After quite a few avid suggestions I finally got myself to watch all 5 seasons of Breaking Bad. My opinion of the show was not always consistent through out. Initially I found the first season a bit difficult to get into and did not completely reach up to the hype that had been generated by everyone that suggested it to me. However, once I continued watching and reached season 3, I was hooked in ways that I have not been before. I found the character development to be extremely different than most of the other shows I have watched. Yes, I did find the plot and action thrilling, but the way in which the characters constantly battled the seduction of the darkness within them was most interesting. I am always used to finding some level of sympathy for characters, always looking for a rationalization to their actions good or bad. In the instance of Dexter, I began to accept who he was and his constant battle with himself and trying to find as balanced a morality as he could, allowed me to accept him. In the case of Walter White, after season 3 when he showed no sign of remorse for the child that had been murdered on the bike I was no longer able to find any justification for his actions. I was no longer able to sympathize with him, instead found him undeserving of any redemption or love for that matter. Being sucked into his own evil to that extent, and being at peace with it even at the last moment is no quality we look for in a hero. Although, as a viewer I was unable to love his character like a lot of other main characters, his story is one that will stand out. His character demonstrates the level at which circumstances can cause you to make a wrong choice. Initially, this choice was justifiable to a certain extent, but after a point it wasn't just about creating a better world for his family, it resulted in the surfacing of his inner evil and greed for power. Jesse on the other hand, was a character I could sympathize with. His constant struggle to right his wrong reflected some level of morality. There were some wrongs that were not justifiable and he was capable of acknowledging that unlike Walter, who would go to any limits to get what he wanted. Overall, Breaking Bad is definitely a show worth watching. It maintains a high degree of reality, keeps you on your edge with great acting; all of which are worthy of appreciation. I knew about this production since a long time, but I couldn't bring myself to watch it until two months ago. So many people have discussed the merits of "Breaking Bad" for such a long time, that I finally brought myself to watch it. And suddenly I stepped into a world so real, that my own everyday life was enriched by this piece of collective artwork. There are not enough words to describe all the feelings and thoughts which crossed my mind when I watched the brilliant performances by Bryan Cranston and Co. The script is very bold, but also true to real life. Vince Gilligan and his team have constructed an arc of episodes which present a modern tale of how an ordinary (or not?) person can break bad under dire circumstances. And how a man can win and lose everything in a short period of time. No matter how hard I try to judge the main character, he is always more true than ever - acting and reacting to the world he lives in. The blending of different personae in one man shows us the real face of the human nature. We all feel connected to this story namely because we relate ourselves directly to many of the aspects of the characters in it. And to be able to express the whole spectrum of human emotions is what defines us not only as viewers, but as people who are able to feel empathy, even to the worst kind of behavior. To me this main character and this story embodies the spirit of our century - accepting without regret what we think and do - with all the consequences brought by our decisions. And after all, these decisions define our lives. Before starting this show I went in with the impression that a lot of the people I know did. It didn't look very good personally and it just looked boring through the trailer of season 1. After a few episodes in to the series boy was I sure wrong. I was already recommending it to others.<br/><br/>There will never be a show that generally made me shake and pause to breathe. The plot twist are actually incredible and its such a short storyline to expand 'Science teacher gets stage 3 cancer and starts to cook meth to provide money for his family when he goes' sounds pretty stupid but once you get into the relationships between the characters and the overall development of Walter White it really is breathtaking. The amount of ditches he needs to fill just to keep his secret safe from his family and more importantly his brother in law who is a DEA.<br/><br/>Bryan Cranston is absolutely inspiring in this TV show and what a way to create a name for yourself by going from Malcolm in the Middle to Breaking Bad. You would truly not think that this is the same person and its one of them acting points where it was truly perfect. <br/><br/>Aaron Paul plays Walter White's sidekick kinda in the meth business and his performance is also great as he applies the comedic side to everything which every show needs this in some ways. <br/><br/>A show like this certainly needs the praise that all the reviewers give it and its one of the very few titles that I have given 10 because its outstanding. To anyone who has never watched it you most certainly need to get your head into gear and prepare for a ride. This is the best show i ever saw! It is the most intense thing i have ever seen. I am always excited for the next episode. I am involved in the show in entirely. It is also completely original. Brian Cranston does a great job as Walter White and couldn't imagine anyone else playing the part. The same goes for Aaron Paul ( as Jesse Pinkman). All of the Acting choices are perfect. The writing is just phenomenal! As I said, it is very intense, and it will leave you white-knuckled the entire series. I was very disappointing when the series ended because it has come such a long way since the first episode. I've had an awesome journey , and I am very thankful for Vince Gilligan for being so creative. I took me a long time to jump on the Breaking Bad hype; I had tried it about a year ago and did not get past episode one. I thought it was slow and boring. However, after all the talk on the internet (imgur, reddit etc) I gave it another try. It is very hard for me to put into words how I feel about this show. Yes, the first series is slow and the action is sparse; but that is life I guess. The writers are trying to tell a real life story about an ordinary person turning to crime.<br/><br/>As the series go by, The action picks up speed and more and more you find yourself on the edge of your seat. I am not one to shout at my TV, but I found myself so often screaming at the TV in sheer amazement. This show draws you in; it emotionally hooks you up to the characters and you are on this ride with them.<br/><br/>Now that it has finished (And just to mention, BB, unlike *many* other TV shows, triumphs with it's ending) I am in two minds. I would absolutely love it to carry on, but I am also glad it finished. There are some shows that just have to finish, and others that just carry on for the sake of making money. BB had it's time and knew when it was done. It was not drug out, it wrapped itself up neatly and put itself on the shelf. These past 2-3 years I have taught myself to appreciate story telling a lot more. This was the result of me coming to realization that TV and cinema are more than just mindless mediums of fun. NO. They are much more than this. Its whole a new world with other worlds branching off each other. When comparing movies and TV i have noticed something. TV have a undeniable advantage over films. TV shows can be a slow burn developing the characters and plot with slow yet engaging pacing. Of course the characters and the plot themselves have to have sense of freshness and creativity about them or the show will not achieve a high level of story telling. Shows like "The Walking Dead", "The Newsroom", "Game of Thrones" and "The Wire" do this very well which is due to impeccable writing. All these shows are great in their own right, but one show I feel has risen above the rest, taken up the crown if you will as perhaps the most impressive and engaging show to ever the bless the television screen. This is of course Vince Gilligan's crime drama "Breaking Bad"<br/><br/>"Breaking Bad" involves a incredibly over qualified chemistry teacher and car wash register Walter White who only makes around 40,000 dollars to his name every year. This is a problem you see as he has a wife with baby on the way and a teenage son with cerebral palsy. To make things worse our smoke free protagonist has been diagnosed with a serious form of lung cancer (i forgot what stage). He is now in a spot of bother but who would come along and pop and idea in his head. Hank Shrader his brother in law who also happens to be DEA agent who makes a meth bust which comes to the attention of Mr White. He knows within himself that he can cook nearly perfect meth and with the right distribution he can provide for his family after he eventually buys it due to his cancer. At this point Walt finally strikes a bit of luck as he comes in contact with an old student of his Jesse Pinkman who happens to be a meth cook and dealer. With some liberating words Walt persuades Jesse to partner up with him to cook and deal meth. This is pretty much the synopsis of the first half of the first episode. After this is the slow burn that is this masterful story.<br/><br/>The first thing that must be noted of this show is the writers ability to link plot points with other plot points to progress the overarching story. Characters and circumstances collide as we watch Walt descend into what his is in "Felina"(Oh yeah Walt is known as Heisenberg in the meth world).Every character is constructed beautifully with Walt, Jesse, Saul, Skyler, Jr, Hank, Marie Jesse, Mike and the menacing Gus. I shall not go further as i don't want to reveal anything too important. The story is also complimented with masterful directing and cinematography with one of the directors being Rian Johnson the directed of the superb "Looper". POV shots FTW!!!!<br/><br/>The plot, writing and directing have ticked a box but all of it would have been in vain if it wasn't for some of the best acting I have seen in any form of entertainment. Bryan Cranston has deserved all the Emmys that he has won with his flawless job as Walter White who makes his transformation believable and unbelievable at the same time. Jesse Pinkman was my favorite character in the show due to Aaron Paul's emotionally gripping performance. This guy has some serious range. The supporting actors where all phenomenal with a couple of stand outs being Gincarlo Esposito as Gus and Dean Norris as the lovable loaf Hank. I could go on for pages about the acting praising Gunn, Mitte, Odenkirk, Banks, Brandt, and Plemons.<br/><br/>I have attempted to describe with justification how good this show is. It is masterfully paced and never bored me. the writing is flawless and acting was also flawless which it definitely needed to be for this kind of content. I will never forget this show and it will have to be trumped by a show forged by the gods to over throne it as the greatest piece of story telling ever put to the television screen.<br/><br/>If you liked this then you might also like-<br/><br/>"The Wire"- Fantastic writing and shows point of view of the gangsters, similar to "Breaking Bad"<br/><br/>"The Sopranos"- anti hero factor<br/><br/>"Walking Dead"- Characterization factor<br/><br/>"Sherlock"- Just because its amazing and everyone should watch it I can say this with utmost faith that there will never be another show like Breaking Bad. It is an incredible piece of art work that shows complex human relationships, how far a man's love for his family take him? How does an under-achiever handle his brilliance? Money, greed , power, addiction and crystal meth !! Breaking bad has it all!!!<br/><br/>And it gives us one of the greatest and complex characters of all time ( same at the level of the Joker of the Dark knight) . Heisenberg.<br/><br/>Yeah, remember this name, because once you start watching breaking bad, you will not forget it!<br/><br/>Bryan Cranston as Walter white is brilliant, Aaron Paul as Jesse Pink Man is stunning as well as hilarious.<br/><br/>So , those who have still not watched this greatest series of all time. Please do yourself a favor. And remember " Its all in the Chemistry"!! I have been a fan of this show since it started. For many years I thought that "Homicide: Life on the Street" was the best and grittiest crime drama I'd ever seen - until "Breaking Bad" appeared. The acting and writing has been terrific from season one right up to now. Bryan Cranston just stuns me, because I still remember him as the moronic father in "Malcolm in the Middle." However, the entire cast is great. Walter White's transformation over the years is one of the best character developments I've ever seen in more than fifty years of watching TV. The intensity of the show is such that I wind up watching it on demand because my wife can't deal with the ruthlessness of the principal characters, and the basic theme. It is well worth the day's wait to catch it the next day. I will be sorry to see one of television's all-time great shows, of any format, wind up after this season. This show is so real its content could easily be construed as too dangerous for TV but is by far the best action packed real to life show I've seen on television to date. I find myself enjoying every facet especially the brilliance behind the program that brought it into our homes where we could experience how normal law abiding citizens can become involved in illicit behavior to benefit loved ones. I enjoy the range of characters,the writer and producer have accurately depicted organized crime bosses to street corner meth heads all filling their place in this drug crazed world. As characters develop you realize business is business even in the drug world. As Walt climbs the corporate ladder you can't help but admire his ability to negotiate, interpolate, and take each new level in stride. Walt's heroic persona depicts strength at so many levels but an unyielding love for family , he ignores personal risk even his own values while focusing on building a financial empire for those he loves. His relationship with Jessie is in itself brilliant as he depicts a mentor, almost father like role yet conflicts and personality differences create one fine show! I applaud each who's taken part in seeing this show through fruition and hope you will enjoy benefits for a very long time. "Thank you"! Breaking bad has every single thing you could want on a show. It has a great plot, unbelievable acting, a ton of action, and some of the biggest bad-asses in TV history. It all starts with the great plot. It is a cool plot where it is so fun to find out whats going to happen next. Probably one of the most addicting shows ever. You can never get bored of breaking bad. You are going to never want to leave the TV. They take an innocent protagonist and turn him into the antagonist but at the same time you love him. It is cool to learn how awesome science can be. The acting is out of this world. I never in a million years thought the goofy Bryan Cranston could take on a serious role and play it better than i could imagine. I had only seen him on Malcolm in the Middle so when I saw him in the description I thought the show would be bad but i could have never been more wrong. Cranston acts out of this world. Aaron Paul shocked me so much. He did an even better job than Cranston. He puts so much emotion into the show. He plays his part perfectly, I could not imagine anyone else playing Jesse Pinkman. The action is out of this world. There are constantly explosions, gun shots, deaths, and much more throughout the show. It really adds great suspense to the show. I think Walter "heisenberg" White (Bryan Cranston) has taken on the role of the biggest bad-ass on TV. He has so many bad ass scenes. Ranging from cool lines to big explosions. Heisenberg has the intelligence of Michael Schofield (Wentworth Miller, Prison Break), he has the craziness of Jack Bauer (Keifer Sutherland, 24), and the pure awesomeness of Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson, Taken). If you have not seen this show than this is the show you have to watch right now. It is the best show on Television. I have just finished watching Season 4 in what I can only describe as the best TV show I've ever watched. I believe Season 5 begins in a few weeks time and my excitement for that is through the roof! If it manages to continue with the same, mind-blowingly powerful standards in Seasons 1,2,3,4 and 5 then I don't see what's stopping Breaking Bad from becoming one of THE BEST television programmes EVER. I like everything about BB; the characters are masterfully sculpted and you can sympathise and empathise with the majority, the plot and story line of each episode is the finest I have ever witnessed and the way that the programme starts and finishes fills you with intrigue and anticipation for the forthcoming episode or next episode since most end on a cliff- hanger and begin with a weird pink bear which builds up your interest and is most puzzling until you find out about it later on. Overall, I feel words can not describe Breaking Bad's brilliance fully. NO SHOW COMPARES TO THIS. The underground world of illegal narcotics has never been displayed in such a captivating, elaborate fashion. Breaking Bad does an excellent job of taking you on a journey. A journey of one man's downward spiral into the methamphetamine world. <br/><br/>The story is captivating and intriguing. The gradual progression of the characters is believable and wildly exciting. There is rarely a dull moment in Breaking Bad. There may be some more seemingly calm moments, but the way that the story unfolds always leaves tension in the air. <br/><br/>Not only is the story incredible, the cinematic vision is some of the best I have ever seen. The transitions are so smooth and clever. Situations where someone stands up from a couch in one room and sits down in another seamlessly, or a vacuum is heard in a room and the same seemingly obnoxious sound changes unknowingly to a car wash without the viewer noticing happens regularly. Kudos to the transition guys for sure!<br/><br/>All in all, Breaking Bad is a terrible story that somehow pulls in and holds the viewer in a suspension of pure awesome. If you have not started watching it, then what are you doing here still reading this review. GO. Watch it. Now.<br/><br/>You're still here? This review is over...GO! Original Story: Check<br/><br/>Scenes that define the word "Suspense": Check<br/><br/>Superb character development: Check<br/><br/>Clamoring for more at the end of the episode: Check<br/><br/>You don't even need to know anything about the show to give it a chance. It's rated #1 all-time on IMDb's Fictional TV rankings, along with Game of Thrones, for a reason. If you give it that one, small, innocent chance to impress you, you will never look back and end up spending your days with your credit card out on AMC's breaking bad merchandise page to flaunt your unfaltering support for this Dramatic Masterpiece. <br/><br/>Tons of Emmys and Breaking Bad Addicts everywhere aren't wrong. I guarantee you After hearing from many of my friends of a new show they have recently began watching known as 'Breaking Bad', i took it upon myself to join the group and view this show for myself.<br/><br/>From the first season and the depth of relationships of characters surround Walter White (Byran Cranston)I began a love for this show, and couldn't wait for each episode to be released to continue to view this powerful and dark story the writers behind Breaking Bad are producing. What better way to present this story than with a fantastic line up of professional actors and actresses.<br/><br/>One character that I felt a serious connection with was the character of Hank Schrader, portrayed by Dean Norris; Hank is a character who may seem at first to bring in humour and banter into the shows atmosphere, but as the shows revels more and goes deeper into the rabbit hole, we discover a darker side to this loyal police man.<br/><br/>I am currently on my second run-through of Breaking Bad, and i still feel all the emotions i felt in my first viewing. This show is powerful, engaging, thrilling in everything aspect and without doubt worth a watch. I would seriously recommend Breaking Bad to audiences, and give it my rating of 10/10 for its story, its characters, its camera work and visual style.<br/><br/>Matthew O'Dee - Student Studying Drama and Acting in Northern Ireland. My brother recommended this show to me a year ago or so because he said it was the best show he had ever seen. I got lucky and saw they were playing the re-runs starting from the first episode on AMC and playing them in order. After the first three episodes I was completely hooked. Best three episodes of TV I have ever seen. And it only gets more gripping from there. Watching this show is like watching something that could take place in real life in the third person. It is 100% realistic and makes you believe your neighbor or someone you know could be doing the same thing. The writers in the show are just so amazingly clever and unpredictable. Absolutely no clichÃ©s and magnificent story telling. Some of these so clever events I guarantee will make your jaw drop in awe. Of course the main character has two years to live so it is no mystery that he will die eventually. So you pretty you have a guy who decides, as the title suggests, to 'Break Bad'. Which pretty much means get as much money as possible manufacturing and selling crystal meth to support his wife, teenage son (who has cerebral palsy), and soon to-be daughter. His brother in-law works for the DEA also and is always one step away from catching Walt, which only adds to the tension.<br/><br/>So he teams up with a former low life student who has connections to get their product on the market. The relationship between him and this student is by far the most electric in the show. They are both EXCELLENT in this show and even more in their scenes together. There chemistry, no pun intended, is just perfect. The acting from the rest of the cast is just terrific also. Anyway, this show is one of the best, if not best shows EVER to air on television. Definitely my favorite. If you are looking for a show that will keep you engaged for the full 40 minutes, with few laughs, some top-notch drama, acting, scenarios, and unpredictability, this one is for you. Definitely give it a try if you have not seen it. You will be glad you did. I won't go deep in the review, since it would take me hours to explain why this show is great. From the action to character development. We see Walter, a high school chemistry teacher fighting with low life standards and lung cancer, turning to a major drug lord who cares only about his ways. Then you have Jessie who actually developed into a good and loyal character, he did bad things and illegal things, but he turned his life over and created something from his previous junkie life.<br/><br/>Watching the show made me wonder why I didn't pay more attention at my chemistry classes. In the end this show is worth watching and will actually motivate you if you are struggling in your life, however just don't break bad. The writing is nearly flawless, and the acting is very good. Simply the best show on TV right now. Period. For years, I have declared my favourite show ever to be The Sopranos, and it still could be.... but this one has to be very close. Most shows seem to take you down paths that never seem to go anywhere, and you are always left with questions unanswered. When all is done, this one may also have questions, but so far, the writing has been complete. My only complaints are that we had to wait so long to see the final season, and that the writers are stopping at only 6 seasons - probably could have gone for at least 1 more... Action packed. Suspenseful. Great story and great characters. One of those shows that I'm just hooked to. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul are both stellar actors and play their roles very well. Also has solid antagonists, and an original story. If you haven't read the summary yet, the show is about a high school chemistry teacher, Walter White (Bryan Cranston) who teams together with his failed junkie student, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) to make crystal methamphetamine. He has been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer and he wants to make sure that his family is set after he is gone, with the meth money. Yet Walter, being the chemistry teacher, ends up making some of the highest quality crystal meth out there. Yet their involvement in the business makes things a bit complicated when they meet the antagonists of the show. Awesome series. Love it. Great, awesome, spectacular. That's 3 words which described those well spent 55 minutes of my day watching this TV show. Let's start with the story: from the second the show starts you are hooked for the first time. And i promise you, it wont be the last. The story engages you from the start due to the amazing rhythm and never lets you go. Even right now I look back to those awesome moments which make this TV show dig into your head and I say "That was probably the picture perfect definition of a good TV show". There were so many moments where my jaw just had to drop and my nails were gone. This show teached me that you can never run out of original ideas. I know many good TV shows that start in an engaging season and the next ones just can't live up to the previous. But this show improved by the moment. The actors are fantastic, specially Brian Cranston who is for me the most interesting and bad ass of them all. Aaron Paul and Dean Norris were the other two who stood out. Of course the others were terrific too, like Anna Gunn and RJ Mitte. The same goes to Aaron who makes his character, Jesse a deep and dynamic one. The actors also look like they are cool dudes to hang out with! The mood of the show is quite dark and realistic and sometimes even funny. The story also brings up many philosophies worth thinking about. You can't help but laugh in some scenes that are so messed up but the way that the director portrays them is very humorous. Vince Gilligan does an amazing job of mixing tension, emotion and laughter. Another thing, the soundtrack! Every song fits perfectly with the scene it's in. It pumps you up in such a way I hadn't experienced yet. Oh man, there are so many scenes I'd like to show you which include a bombastic song, but I want to make this spoiler free. In the end this TV show is an example of spectacular acting, directing, editing and plot. All TV shows should take this show as an example and as inspiration. Hail to the king baby! First of all, I don't think people should compare this series with series like The Wire or The Sopranos. I've seen for example The Wire too but the only thing it has in common that it's about drugs. It's just like comparing apples with pears (a phrase we use in Belgium if people compare things that are nothing alike). The only thing you can say if you mention those two series is that their complementary. Were The Wire fixates more on the distribution, the police work and those things Breaking bad fixates more on the production of the matter. Where The Wire has no specific main character(s), Breaking Bad fixates on 2 main characters Walter White and Jesse Pinkman. <br/><br/>Now enough with the comparison, I think I've made my point. Breaking bad is one of the best shows I've ever seen. Great acting by all of the cast. It's no wonder that Bryan Cranston has been nominated for the golden globe for best actor the last 3 years. He should have won it already! Also Aaron Paul is amazing and one of the best supporting actors in a show.<br/><br/>Breaking bad started of mind blowing! Just the pilot alone was maybe the best pilot I've ever seen. I think there are a lot of people who can agree with me on that. Just the concept was a lot of fun. The chemistry teacher who wants to make crystal meth just to make his life a little more exciting. <br/><br/>After season one where Walter White is just starting up in his caravan it become's even more fun with the calm but fearless Gustavo Fring. For me, the most memorable scene from this series is the moment he comes out of Tio Salamanca's room with the right side of his face blown off. When he walks out with his usual look, straighten his jacket and just falls down. Really great scene. Just so i don't forget: Also an amazing acting performance from Giancarlo Esposito all the way.<br/><br/>I look forward to the last part of season 5 but i can't imagine that it would be disappointing. Just to end a last comparison with The Wire. I have to say I like them both very much, but I still find Breaking Bad to be better! After I finished watching the fourth season finale of Dexter I starting looking for a show to watch that could tide me over until the next season started, so I decided to check out Breaking Bad. I picked this show because I used to watch Malcolm and the Middle and noticed how popular it was. I hadn't really paid any attention to the commercials so I didn't know what the show was about before watching. I was surprised when I watched the pilot episode. I thought he was going to be playing another version of Hal(Malcolm in the Middle) when I first saw Bryan Cranston standing in the middle of the desert wearing tighty whities. Boy was I wrong. I was hooked from the very first episode. The show has amazing actors and writers. It is not surprising this show has won so many awards. I only wish I had started watching this when it first came on. Like so many other great shows, I started watching it after it became very successful so I ended up staying up all night watching the first three seasons in three days. Breaking Bad is a series that could go into TV history books! Nothing from these days can top these series!<br/><br/>I watched seasons 1 till 5 in about 3 months. So the storyline is still fresh in my mind. It is remarkably how good the total fits together. There really aren't any gaps. In the beginning, it became already clear to me that this is going to be something good. Great acting off course, and a new kind of story we never heard before in a series. Also, the story felt extremely realistic. Mister Heisenberg, or Walt, had my compassion. I understood him with a little trying. But the story evolved quickly. Things became serious and Walt had to deal with more criminal facts than just cooking. But still Walt seemed to pull me to his side. Walt is a flexible character an changes gradually into a psychopath rather than be a family providing man.<br/><br/>Also, on the artistic view, the camera-work and editing was done great. It was not a simple drama series. There was a lot of attention to beautiful flashbacks and flash-forwards. Also the camera shoots often in a lot perspectives. And if you pay attention, the use of music is very accurate.<br/><br/>Lastly I would like to prize the series ability for not only be a standard drama, but also adding action and thriller or even horror at some times. The blood shedding is realistic. There isn't that much killing. And if somebody has been killed, there is a lot of attention payed to the disposal of the remains and processing the loss.<br/><br/>I would recommend this not standard high quality series to everyone! (Well, except kids) Breaking Bad combines terrific writing, superb acting and excellent camera-work for a suspense-laden, exciting, humorous and dramatic show. The story is just so rich and full of surprises that your eyes will be glued to the screen. I also like the in-your-face realism, one seldom thinks that some scenes are too theatrical, no, even the spectacular or very coincidental parts are written and shot in a way that makes you think, why not? and places you in the midst of the action. The masterful writing leads to erroneous details that a viewer well versed in chemistry or DEA work will find being easily forgiven for the plot's sake, it's not a documentary after all. It's great how the story focuses on all levels involved with the meth trade, including the street dealer, lab work, be it in an RV, a hidden superlab or using fumigated houses for concealment, the police, corrupt lawyers, money laundering, how families get destroyed, big corporate moneymaking, the violence of Mexican drug cartels etc. While some may argue that a weak point of BB is the fact that you have to watch it beginning-to-end to really understand what's going on, IMHO this just highlights the strong writing, trying to tie up as many loose ends as possible, having earlier mistakes come to haunt Walt in later episodes, and so forth. Hank is always just one step behind Walt by picking up clues from previous episodes that the audience can piece together easily. The suspense is the show's other strength, at numerous times Walt is so close to being found out and still escapes by luck or ingenuity. There's the whole cat-and-mouse game of living a double life, getting entangled in lies, hiding in plain sight that the viewer can piece together and eagerly wait for the characters to unwind. This also adds to the comedic value, a lot of which stems from the character's witty lines full of dark humor, and great acting, also from the supporting cast. Cranston rightly deserves his Emmys for an astonishingly wide and realistic portrayal of emotions. Saul Goodman is another great character, well acted by Odenkirk, hilarious but realistic, and the epitome of white-collar crime. I could go on and on about how the characters' lives entwine, how things very nearly go wrong, how many lives Walt ruins in his quest to satisfy his hurt pride. If the script was made into a novel it would be a bestseller. Add to this a variety of creative camera angles, beautiful scenes of the endless New Mexico skies and high desert ranges, and this is also a treat for the eyes. An absolute must-see. There is also a moral tone to the story, and we see very clearly the effects the drug trade has on all that are involved. Families get ruined, from the Pinkmans to the Whites to the numerous sad but realistic end users of Walt's drugs. The violence involved, the complete wreck that Walt becomes while everything is seemingly running well are also strong messages to the audience. While it's sad to see the show end next summer, even this speaks in its favor. Rather than milking a good brand until it becomes boring, like so many other TV series that started out great and then watered down, this masterpiece knows when to retire: when it's at the top. I for one cannot wait to see what imaginative ingenuity they come up with for Heisenberg's finale. I expect a lot from a TV-show to give it a 10/10-rating. However, this is one of those few TV-gems that deserves it. I don't want to ruin the experience for anyone, so I'll try to keep this review as spoiler-free as possible. <br/><br/>A few years ago, a friend of mine told me about this show. This was just after the second season had aired. I didn't really know what to expect when I started watching the pilot, but after 10 minutes I was already hooked! Every episode of Breaking Bad leaves you hungry for more. The suspense(?) continues throughout the series, and even though there are "slower" episodes here and there, you won't get bored. <br/><br/>One of the aspects I like most about Breaking Bad, is Walters struggle to keep living his double-life. When he walks out the door, he's a meth- cook, but at house he is a dad and husband. Bryan Cranston is amazing as Walter White, but also Aaron Paul(Jessie) and most of the other actors are incredible in their roles.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad is without doubt my favorite TV-show. In my opinion, TV can't be better than this. Check it out. You won't be disappointed :) First I should say that I have watched the first four seasons and the first 5 episodes of the fifth season of the show. So I have pretty much watched nearly 90% of this TV series for now, so my review should be fairly representative of the overall quality of this TV series.<br/><br/>So, this is it people, the ultimate TV series. I never was more entertained for longer amounts of time than this TV series. It is indeed a unique TV series, delivering higher quality drama than 99% of the films in the cinemas and at larger doses. It represents the culmination of modern cable TV and shows indeed, that writers of TV shows are becoming more creative than the Hollywood film makers, who appear to lack any real ideas.<br/><br/>A TV series for those that like TV, but not for children: this is a quite graphic, violent and strong piece of audio visual entertainment. I'm not one to get all melodramatic over a television show, I can't stand people who do it, but this show seriously cannot be rated high enough. The brilliant mix of A-grade acting, top-notch writing, suspense, humour, twists, photography and soundtrack is something that will keep fans of any genre entertained.<br/><br/>The change that comes over Walt's face when he turns from mild-mannered chemistry teacher to Heisenberg, the all-conquering drug manufacturing king-pin is remarkable when accompanied by that little head-tilt. You want to see a drug-manufacturer lose, but you want Walt to win.<br/><br/>I could go on about the show, but nothing I say could do it justice. Just watch it, there is literally no way you will regret it. It has taken me quite an amount of time to think of words to describe this incredible masterpiece of a show. As a matter of fact, calling this just a "show" in my opinion is an outright insult. The vast and complex twists and turns of this "show" are unending as well as brilliant. However, these descriptions of the overall structure of the show don't even come close to the acting. Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul, Giancarlo Esposito, the list of excellence goes on and on. Before I miraculously stumbled upon this show by way of Netflix, these names were only mere actors, just people, but after watching the series, they became artists to me, Emmy-collecting artists. <br/><br/>Now that I'm done salivating over the achievements of the show let's talk about the plot which is also genius. Bryan Cranston of the hit sitcom, Malcolm in the Middle plays a financially struggling high school teacher named Walter White, who is a happy easy-going husband and father to a child with Cerebral Palsy becomes terminally ill with lung cancer. The news of his diagnosis takes a huge toll on White's morale causing him to drastically panic which inevitably provokes White to "Break Bad" in a sense, and begin cooking Methamphetamine. His partner in crime is one of White's former High school students named Jessie Pinkman who is played by (my new favorite actor) Aaron Paul. Paul's portrayal of Jesse has been so beyond perfect that fans often sympathize with his feelings much more than Walt's. His performance has even impressed me enough to buy several other of his films. Paul's character could be described as a lost kid trying to find his way. Especially in today's world, many can related to his never ending, complicated situation. We discover throughout the show's existence that Jesse, despite all of his distress has a huge heart and truly cares for others, particularly kids. both Walter White and Jesse Pinkman develop a very special relationship as they together traverse into a world of drug lords, junkies, and all else that comes with the meth business or as Walt calls it the "Empire Business."<br/><br/>As well as a consummate story, certain thematic aspects are also beautifully amalgamated into the series by writer Vince Gilligan such as the very accurate behaviors and mannerisms users of meth demonstrate. Viewers of the show also see what its like to lose what you love most and not have the opportunity to take it back. The true meaning of family is challenged throughout the series but its clear that "Family always comes First" as Walter always demands. This show is awesome!! I was blown away immediately. Who would have thought that Bryan Cranston had that kind of force? The characters on Breaking Bad are rich with life. Every character on the show has a humanity about them that just drags you into the unfolding drama. The only character I don't like is Skylar. With all the drug dealers, thieves, and macho tough guys it's hard to believe that she would come across as the most ungrateful, callous, and cold hearted person on the show. Her character should be killed off the show. Bryan Cranston is outstanding and the supporting cast are superb. AMC has stepped up the game for all shows. I can't stop watching. This show rocks!! Breaking bad is one of the best series i have seen so far. I have watched the full 3 series and i like the way they combined the world of chemistry with the world off drugs. All the 3 series were good in my opinion. The episodes give you also a good view on how the world with chemistry and drugs is related.<br/><br/>It's about the story of Walt. He's a high school chemistry teacher. He is married and has a son (who has palsy) and a baby on the way. He also works part time at a car wash to earn an extra few bucks, but he and his family still are not doing well financially. One day he gets diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, what means he can't live much longer. But instead of dealing with it (for example, going to a therapist or talking about it with his wife, whom he doesn't tell), he quits his work at the car wash and start thinking about making drugs to earn enough money to provide he's family a good and easy live without troubles after his death. Later on, he finds out a former student of his, Jesse Pinkman is a dealer. And they make a deal: Walt uses his chemistry background to create the Meth while Pinkman uses his connections to sell it. But Walt didn't know the drug world was that hard, and even if you make good Meth, you will not be rewarded with lots of money, because the problem is you can't sell it in large amounts but only to the local drug users. Walt wants more and wants to work for big companies. But the problem is where do you find them, and who can you trust in the drugs world? If you want to find out, and watch an incredible good story line. Then you definitely have to watch Breaking Bad.<br/><br/>Written by a 17 year old Dutch student. Who tries to improve his English. This is the first time I have wrote a review so bare with me. First of breaking bad is the best acting plot character based series I have seen. I loved dexter but this has taken it up a few notches I won't go into the story or what happens. I have just finished watching series 3 on Netflix and enjoyed it more than any other show on the television. The man who plays Walter is superb as is his young protégé Jesse together they spin a story that just keeps you wanting to come back for more too see where there life is going next. I don't know much about the director or production but they deserve an Emmy As do the actors because it felt as though they had put real people in unreal situations. But you still believed it was possible for them to be there and what would you do if it were you fantastic 10/10 Just finished watching S2 ,and ,i was amazed with these series. Was expecting story of cancer having teacher taking opportunity to make much money with making drug,got money get well....But after watching 3 episodes i saw i was wrong ,watched whole season 1 in one day, couldn't stop watching<br/><br/>Acting of Cranston (watched previously in Malcolm) is outstanding ,whole show is, but turning from ordinary teacher to drug making genius ,wow. Story is fantastic with so many twist and turns, especially liked relationship between Mr. White and Hank, and Mr.White and Jesse.<br/><br/>Best show i have ever seen....<br/><br/>Keep up... Bryan Cranston as Walter white is the bad - assertive ''good guy'' who finds himself in a lot of trouble...because of a troubled student he used to teach high school chemistry to.<br/><br/>Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman is the bad - troubled kid who narrowly escapes doing time for cooking Crystal. And guess who's brother in law is a top DEA agent and happens to be at the scene...Walter.<br/><br/>Walter and Jesse undertake a dangerous journey , playing the dangerous game, with dangerous people. This is a fantastic show with secrets COOKING until boiling point and the consequences spread like a cancer for Walter. I don't know where to begin. This show fulfills everything I really expect to see in a good TV series. <br/><br/>It has a way of even making the slow scenes entertaining. Not many films/series' can do that. It really is one of those shows where you cant wait any longer for the next episode. I recently bought all 4 seasons and have just watched it non-stop.<br/><br/>The acting is ace. I love the relationship Mr White and Jessie have, although at sometimes i feel pitiful for Jessie, the stray druggie who has a heart of gold. <br/><br/>The way it incorporates all the setbacks to the drug production allows the TV series to expand its limitations and take it to unexpected twists, it is really hard to predict what will happen next in this show, which i love<br/><br/>All in all i believe it is yet to be beaten as a series. Ever Since the end of Lost I have been in a grim mood searching for a Show that meets my eye, just recently I started watching Breaking Bad. Breaking Bad is a work of art, and is easily one of my two favorite dramas. The first season is absolutely mind blowing. Most shows start to drag on and run out of ideas, and start to really crap the bed. Breaking Bad seems to just get stronger through each season, the whole entire show runs on the literary technique of dramatic irony. Meaning the viewer knows something that the characters don't. I find the plot unbelievably creative and realistic. I am extremely excited for the fifth season coming out next summer, season four ended with a bang. Now Vince Gilligan has his hands full with a destined amazing last season. Breaking Bad is so far a tremendous work of art, a show that truly could have gone anywhere from the brilliant pilot episode. Bryan Cranston has finally been able to prove what a brilliant actor he is with the character of Walter White and the unbelievable journey through the downward spiral he has taken us, and in my opinion, what a joy it has been to sit shotgun to show creator Vince Gilligan's crazy vision of the most messed up midlife crisis I have ever seen. Each episode seems to always throw more fire into the flames as the journey becomes more dangerous by the minute. Mr White reminds me of a teacher I had in high school, someone I always expected lived a very boring and routine life, not ever any real danger to it. But after watching Walter whites journey so far, who knows, maybe my teacher was a me-th cook as well. Breaking Bad "cooks" like a great show. Cooking is a term you will come to know from Breaking Bad. The main character played by Bryan Cranston (Malcom in the Middle, Clerks) is amazing as Walter White. Bryan pulls off his dynamic character well.<br/><br/>This show is emotionally engaging on a large scale. It entertains jocks, nerds, gangstas, lovers and loners.<br/><br/>The most intriguing thing about this show is the script. It's explosive but to make it even better the cinematography shines bright! The beauty of the Mexico bordered south is jaw dropping here. <br/><br/>None of us can grasp what they have went through to make this show, on such a low budget and such low viewer ship. The producers, actors, and directors, and more poured their blood, sweat, and tears into making this show I'm sure.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad is as original as it is beautiful.<br/><br/>Go watch this now! This show is simply the most captivating series I have ever watched. For the the past several years Dexter has been the only show on TV that held my interest from week to week......until now! I watched the first 3 seasons in a matter of days. I have become totally invested in the main characters, and am amazed at the chemistry between the cast members. It's refreshing to finally see a show that allows Bryan Cranston to use his skills to full potential. The man is a superb actor. Needless to say, Walt (Cranston) is my favorite character on the show. Coming in at a close second is Dean Norris, as Hank. Once again, a tremendous acting job. His character, along with Bob Odenkirk's character, Saul Goodman, provide much of the comedy relief. Speaking of Bob Odenkirk, it's good to see him thriving in this role as the "dirty lawyer". At first Saul seems like a simple comedic character, but as the show progresses, different sides of Saul are revealed. If you are looking for a good show to start watching, WATCH BREAKING BAD! Season 4 just started and did not disappoint.<br/><br/>The intense, visceral expression of this show is unlike anything I have ever seen on TV. The insight into the human mind displayed in "Breaking Bad" provides plenty of food for thought, and the entire cast have the ability to bear this huge responsibility on their shoulders and make it believable and engaging. Giancarlo Esposito and Bryan Cranston are in the portrayals of their careers.<br/><br/>It's rare to really be able to say something like this, yet it still sounds like a cliché, but this show just truly contains everything: Great writing, acting and straight up BRILLIANT cinematic execution that spares no expenses on symbolism, intensity and grit.<br/><br/>It's nice that somewhere, someone is keeping it real. OK, so when I see a critic give a movie 4 stars, I immediately say, yeah right - because the hype, the type of movie a critic considers to be 4 stars is many times not the same kind of movie a person looking for something great would consider 4 stars. Reviewers and moviegoers are worlds apart on taste.<br/><br/>Now, I give Breaking Bad 10 out of 10 yes. But it isn't for everyone. Watch the pilot. And then, if you can stay with it, and watch the next and the next, I am almost confident it will completely grab hold of you and a show about a lowly chemistry teacher turned meth cooker will become your drug of choice - I swear - but that's only if it grabs you.<br/><br/>The base scenario: Chemistry Teacher, who had aspirations for bigger things stuck in marriage to controlling wife with son who has Cerebral Paulsy and wife also baby on way. Brother in law works for the DEA. Chem teacher finds out he has terminal lung cancer and after finding out from DEA bro-in-law the huge money involved in cooking meth, decides to get into it to provide for family after his death (secretly of course).<br/><br/>It's 3 seasons old with a 4th season due in July 2011 and it has only gotten better season by season. It is amazing, gripping, disgusting, upsetting, emotional, slick, pathetic, scary, adrenalizing...and a bunch of other words - all in one shot.<br/><br/>The reason? The acting and writing. These two things make Breaking Bad the best show I've ever seen on TV. The acting is so freaking' good. Also, the writing isn't just what you're seeing on screen. It goes deeper than that. The way the actors execute bring the writing to levels unheard of in TV.<br/><br/>Fans of Dexter or Six Feet Under will want to try this one out. Even if you're not, give it a try and maybe you'll like it. Me? I'm a nut case about the show so I'll say try it no matter what you're a fan of. AMC has proved over the last three or four years that they have the most provocative shows on television. They have controlled the Emmy wins in the drama category, letting the Big Four know that they can hold their own on the battlefield too. This is all due to their two big shows, Mad Men and Breaking Bad, the latter of which is currently my favorite show on television. Breaking Bad stars Bryan Cranston of Malcolm in the Middle fame and Aaron Paul, as Walter White and Jesse Pinkman, respectively. Bryan Cranston has won three straight Emmys (all three years the show has aired) for Best Actor in a Drama, while Aaron Paul finally won the Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Emmy this past year.<br/><br/>The series follows Walter White, a high school chemistry teacher, who in the first episode of the show is diagnosed with lung cancer. Once his initial shock has passed, Walter realizes that he needs to provide for his family when he is gone. While at his 50th birthday party, Walter's DEA agent brother-in-law, Hank (played by the wonderful Dean Norris), turns on the news in time for everyone to witness him bust a methamphetamines lab. Walt sees the amount of money involved and proceeds to go on a ride along with Hank. While Hank is busting another meth lab, Walt waits in the car and witnesses one of the drug dealers escaping. They make eye contact and Walt recognizes Jesse Pinkman, a former student, as the escaping dealer. He later goes to Jesse's house, where they begin a partnership which becomes the focus of the series.<br/><br/>There is not a weak link to be found in any part of this series. Never have I been so stunned by a television series as when I first watched Breaking Bad. The writing, directing, editing, music, acting I could go on and on. Vince Gilligan, the creator and frequent writer and director, had such a unique vision for this series, and it is exemplified throughout the show. The writing creates a sense of tension which is escalated by the superb acting that each cast member brings to the table. Bryan Cranston does not just portray Walter White; he is Walter White. It's stunning to see such performances from Malcolm's father. At its core, this is truly a story about a man's battle with cancer, and you see Bryan portray a sad indifference about his situation. He makes such a turn as a character that you almost wouldn't recognize Walter in the first episode as the same Walter in later seasons. He becomes so complacent with his condition that he takes risks he normally wouldn't and constantly shows us at every turn, that he is truly at peace and ready to die.<br/><br/>The supporting characters have just as much acting chops as Bryan Cranston, too. Aaron Paul gives an incredible presentation as a meth dealing drug addict. He makes you think he has nothing to live for and nothing to care about and then at times will show you that he really still is a little boy at heart. Anna Gunn plays Walt's pregnant wife, Skyler, showing us a concerned spouse, already mourning her husband before he is gone. As her suspicion builds as to what Walt could be up to during the endless amount of hours he spends away from his family, she begins to care less about her husband's condition and more about why he isn't spending his last days with his family. Dean Norris plays Hank, the DEA agent brother-in-law, who Walt spends a lot of time avoiding due to his newfound drug selling. Hank plays a great supporting character, hunting down a drug lord, who unbeknownst to him is in fact his brother-in-law, Walt. He becomes an even better character in the second season when he gets a real story arc of his own. RJ Mitte plays Walt's son, Walter Jr., a teenager who is afflicted with cerebral palsy. He is the most distraught about his father's condition and has some great emotional scenes, especially during the arc where Walt is deciding whether or not he wants to go through treatment. Last but not least is Marie, Hank's wife and Skyler's sister, played by Betsy Brandt. She is easily the most transparent of all the characters, mostly merely playing supportive wife and/or sister.<br/><br/>In conclusion, watch this show. If you have ever watched anything on television, you will like it. Hell, if you have never seen a television in your life, you will still fall in love with this show. The character development that results from Walt's cancer diagnosis is equally matched by the plot twists thrown at you each episode. This is a show to best all other shows and it is truly the greatest television show I have ever watched. The third season has came to end, and all I can say, this is the best I saw so far! The only show I watched beside Breaking Bad and had such a crushing storyline was Lost - but they messed it up ... Anyway, I can hardly wait the 4th season to start, till now it has wonderful characteristics with magnificent acting, great storyline, outstanding photography and a good direction. Recommended to everybody, who'd like to watch an exciting, animated show, with lifelike and rough-and-ready situations and turns.<br/><br/>The only reason I give a 9 out of 10, because this is not yet completed, not yet a finished story, but as the time passes, it gets closer and closer to it...<br/><br/>Outstanding show.<br/><br/>9/10. I heard amazing things about the show from friends who are on the latest series right now. so i started looking into the show and seeing what it was like and i read so many good things on IMDb and other review sites saying it was the greatest show ever so naturally i was very excited about it. <br/><br/>So i brought season one and started watching and i even text my friend after episode one saying how amazing it was so i sat there and watched like episodes 1, 2 and 3 all in one go and LOVED it. but then i got onto episode four and i was bored, the show went from being super entertaining to watching a guy on screen doing absolutely nothing. In my opinion the show just went super boring after the mid-way point of series one. However i stayed glued to it, hoping it would pick back up and after eight episodes i decided it wasn't even worth carrying it on. everyone who has heard my opinion have all said the same thing ''you need to wait until series three, that's when it gets really good''. I don't want to wait until a third series of a program before it gets good. <br/><br/>i think what made it much more off a lesser experience for me is that i was watching season 1,2 and 3 of boardwalk and walking dead right before i started watching breaking bad. and i must say that i honestly don't know why breaking bad is so popular when shows like boardwalk and walking dead exist. 5/10. Best show in TV ever? Master Piece? Yeah, right! Its good, but its NOT THAT GOOD! Read so much about this show, got the whole 5 season to to find the critics were so off! First of all, the script was boring, dull and predictable. Terminally ill chemistry teacher X mid life crisis? A recipe for yawn! As for acting, to be fair, Bryan Cranston is good, better than Liev Schreiber in Ray Donovan, but definitely could not beat James Spader in Black List and Kevin Spacey as FU for the Golden Globe 2013! When I binge on the Black List and Utopia I wished everyday had 48 hours and wish it would never end. With Breaking Bad, after the first season I basically dozed through the second season and then just turning it on while working just for the heck of it. Breaking Bad follows a cancer-diagnosed chemistry teacher that suddenly decides to produces methamphetamine, initially to collect enough money to secure his family's future once he is gone.<br/><br/>His partner is a cool but immature meth-user in his early 30s. Together they form an unlikely duo that has the combination of great chemistry knowledge and a certain know-how into the drug business.<br/><br/>Season 1 is arguably the best season I have seen of any action series. The characters are getting into realistic scenarios and their reactions and solutions are plausible indeed. Yet at the same time, it's packed with action and drama. Super great. 9.9/10 <br/><br/>Season 2 follows up in this footstep. Here we also see a huge character development, especially from Walt, who turns into a more hard character. 9.6/10 <br/><br/>Season 3 makes the transition into really big-time production and the drama of power struggles in the drug industry truly emerges. The two main characters feels less safe and are afraid of their lives, especially Walt. Their actions to maintain their own personal safety are not always easy to buy though. What was the flagship of this series the first two season, namely that you could understand and accept all the actions the characters took, are fading away. And there are a lot of "logical plot holes" like the fact that they go over hell and high water to get hold of methyl-amine (which they pronounce completely wrong by the way, even Walt which always instantly reminds you of that he in fact is not a chemist at all) when in rather common knowledge that it is very easy to make from readily available ingredients and trivial chemistry. 8.8/10<br/><br/>Season 4. The plot holes and the "Why didn't they just..."-question builds up exponentially in this season. The amount of revealing information that are being communicated over phone in this season is completely unbelievable and make the show less believable. It really challenges the border of artistic license. The show starts to TRY and be sophisticated, complex and intelligent, but in reality it just loses the nice realism and rationality the show had over the first 2 or 3 seasons. If you want a lot of twist, you MUST follow up by convincing the audience at some time why the things happened the way they did when several other options seemed much more natural. Unfortunately for the most part, the show never answer these questions, which is a big thumbs down.<br/><br/>To summarize, a lot of the drama in this season are based on "Well OK, but why did he do that instead?" It almost feel like you are watching 24, which is not a complement in any way. A lot of actions are not logical, nor ever explained. You just get more and more question marks, which are, unfortunately never answered, thus the comparison to the show 24, which is notorious for this bad habit. 7.3/10 <br/><br/>Season 5. Some of the episodes are really interesting and surprising, but they are in no way intelligent. The viewer keeps getting insulted by the lack of continuity and rationality. But most people accept this as there is so much tension and drama, but really, considering how great the two first seasons was, you cannot help but feeling let down. Some episodes completely kills the great character development that has happened over the first five seasons. 7.5/10 <br/><br/>And I am wondering how people in here keep referring to Walt as smart. A lot of the things he does is actually outright stupid, naive, over-protective and last but not least, irrational for the sake of irrationality. It is as if they want the viewers to think "Man, he is so smart, I didn't see that twist coming." when in fact if you sit down and think about it, the twist was in no way a proof of "Walt's intelligence", but just a random deviation from rationality. The ricin story is arguably one of the greatest examples of this. The plan is so complex and risky, with a very limited probability of a successful preferably outcome, which makes it easy to think of a handful of other ways to accomplish the same goals with much less effort and risks. But I guess it is good to make good drama and unfortunately the last half of Breaking Bad is more about making good drama and action, whereas the first half was just a top-quality show where no unanswered question-mark was left unanswered for to long...<br/><br/>Overall, a great action drama show, but be prepared to be disappointed after a few seasons (unless you only watch BB for the violence that is as apparently a lot of people do) as it goes all "24" after a while. Action and Drama wins over intelligence in the end...<br/><br/>It's amazing how much hate people are spreading in here as soon as a person does not unconditionally praise this show into the sky. I think it says a lot about a big part of the audience this show had... Bryan Cranston shows his acting skills portraying the complex character of Walter White. He's a long suffering high school chemistry teacher who suddenly finds he's dying of cancer. With little prospect of leaving anything to his family, he teams up with a former student Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) to make meth. They're so good at it that they become major criminals.<br/><br/>This is the best of television which can be found on cable. Walter White is a complex character that actually grows over the life of the show. He is a good character that we root for at the beginning even thought he's become a criminal. The journey he makes is one worthy of great literature. It is absolutely must see TV. Avoid this show! Tastes are different, I do agree, so that's why this show has a 9,6 grade. It was definitely graded so high by those who wanted to find out and learn how to make crystal meth, kill a person, get rid of a corpse etc. I really can't see what's interesting about this show. The plot is very disgusting and morbid, I wouldn't recommend this to an adult, let alone a young adult or a teenager. Can someone really grade as a 10 melting a corpse with acid in a bath tub? After that, cleaning blood and bones...! I would like to know what kind of population graded this series as a 10?! It is very sad that this show is a hit on the social networks for quite a while. Heard great things about this series and was bitterly disappointed. I sat through the first season as it was only 7 eps however I gave up after 2 eps of season 2 as I was still waiting for something to happen. I was expecting a gritty crime thriller and instead was treated to a slow moving, way too American load of drivel. By all means watch this if you want to spend your time watching his ugly irritating wife and equally irritating in-laws sit around whinging and whining for two thirds of the show. I might as well have been watching a lecture on the healing benefits of sharing or living right the American way. <br/><br/>This show was so bad it kept me awake thinking about the time I wasted.<br/><br/>Way too slow and boring to keep me interested... Decided to rewatch star trek TNG instead. No matter how many times my husband makes me watch it, I still think its rubbish Maybe I still haven't given it enough time, but I'm really struggling to continue watching the show. I watched seasons 1 & 2 and it has failed to impress me so far. Dexter and Game of Thrones are my favorite TV shows and after watching 1 episode of each I was completely hooked. Don't get me wrong, Breaking Bad is well directed and has some good acting; I can see why it is such a popular show. The dialogue is better than that of Dexter and about equal to The Game of Thrones. Maybe its just because the story line does not appeal to me whatsoever. Turning to selling drugs for money, even in tough times, is a sign of cowardice in my opinion. The money in the show does nothing for me; there are much easier and more ethical ways to make money. Find a passion, follow your dreams, and create your own future is what I believe in. Even though Walter only wants the best for his family, he does it in an oppressive way that simply drives him away from his family and loved ones. That is no way to die! Contains SPOILERS I have never written a review before, but i couldn't help myself. THIS SHOW SUCKS. This is by far the WORST show i have ever seen. OMG, The errors that are made, all that nonsense that is said, it is boring, and how they make Walter look like the good guy is just SICKENING. It looks like they motivate people to make this choice. This is really disturbing. If u like this show, u will have to be a madman yourself. At least a little bit. I wish i could give this a 0/10. I really struggled to watch this show and it is most certainly the most awful show ever. U should never want to watch something like this. It can never be unseen, which is sad. Breaking Bad is a good show that is worthy of praise however it is not worthy of iconic status. While it started quite poorly and dragged on in its initial seasons the show certainly improved in the final seasons. Even some of most loyal fans would agree Season 1 had a slow start. Unlike iconic shows that hit the ground running Breaking Bad failed to impress at the start. While the series is about the transformation of a character which came together full circle in the end the series is lucky it never got cancelled at the beginning because of the dullness and unimpressive story lines. Far better shows that showed more promise have not been given the same chance like Breaking Bad but towards the final seasons fans who stuck to the show were rewarded. The series finale has to be the best series finale I have ever seen, it was perfect. Hence I gave a stronger rating. <br/><br/>The stars of the show do a great job with their characters and the viewer enjoys the odd and unusual partnership between Walter White and Jesse Pinkman. We also have a few solid performances from other characters such as Gus, Walter's brother in law, Hank, and Saul Goodman who hit it out of the park. However other characters such as Skylar White really annoy and frustrate the viewer. Besides her selfishness and coldness she is simply unlikeabale as a character. <br/><br/>I do not believe it deserves to be in IMDb's top 10. While many say this show is indeed a journey, it was a boring and rocky journey to begin with. It was initially unimpressive, slow and failed to hit the ground running as great shows often do. A good journey contains valuable nuggets or plots that entices its viewers. It is definitely not in the same league as Game of Thrones which can be regarded as an epic. <br/><br/>The spin off show by its creator, Better Call Saul impresses and excels in areas where Breaking Bad falls short. So you better call and watch Saul which is a much better show and showcases far better writing and story lines. <br/><br/>Overall a decent show but it definitely saved its best and very memorable acts for the end - 7/10 Breaking Bad is a perfect example that there is no need for special effects, zombies or blowing up buildings in order for a TV series to be excellent. The storyline and the combination of a variety of characters gives the series such balance and flow. The show gets better by season and eventually you are onto season 5 which is one of the most brilliant productions of all time.<br/><br/>The ending scene is sensational as we see how drug production really did destroy Walter White and create a new man in Heisenberg. Breaking bad truly does capture you emotionally which is something which keeps giving you the desire to watch the next episode. Overall, an incredible series. Breaking Bad isn't just a show, it's a catharsis. When I first saw Br. Ba. I was like little children at Christmas morning; I can't wait for the next event. First season was a slowly but impressive beginning, and every season was a little bit more a little bit more insane. But what makes this series awesome? The actors. Bryan Cranston's forming is inimitable. I think Walter White's character development is the greatest transfiguration on the TV screen we have ever seen. The reason why I'm saying this, is the scene from the end when Walter tells Skyler that he maked methamphetamine because he liked it, is the most shocking scene and it changes the meaning of the series. We all believed Walter did everything for save his family and keep them safe, but in the end we got a beat on our chest which makes the whole show more fantastic. Obviously this is just one example, but maybe the biggest revolution. Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman is also a great choice I think all of us hated on him until the end of the show. He was a moron in my opinion, but he could beat the sickness (drug-addiction) and found people who are important for him. Jesse made choices which are questionable and non-sense that's one of the reasons why I didn't like him. And we've got awesome supporting actors like Gus Fink (Giancarlo Esposito), Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk) and many more who make the show even better. Actually I'm trying to write down every single points which describe the hugeness of Breaking Bad but it's impossible. If you have not watched, I recommend it for everyone It'll blow your mind I promise. To be honest, when I heard about this show, I wasn't interested at all. I'm not much of a TV guy, so it shouldn't be surprising that I wasn't interested in the first place. After a few years after it started, a friend of mine recommended this show to me and I finally watched it. I was blown away. I have never watched a series more addictive or gripping in my entire life. After each episode, you'll just be wanting more and more. This show has everything such as perfect writing, unforgettable scenes and a top notch soundtrack.<br/><br/>I honestly believe Breaking Bad is better than most movies ever made, and that's saying a lot. I would highly recommend this show to anyone. If you have not seen this show yet, start with the pilot episode and go on from there. You will not be disappointed in the slightest.<br/><br/>Score: 10/10 I don't watch crime series (I am Sci-Fi/Fantasy guy) that much, but I am simply amazed by this one, even more than I was with Sherlock. This show is full of mind-blowing (no pun intended) plot twists. The ending is perfect. The beginning is perfect. Everything is perfect, even that "Fly" episode. Vince is a genius, Bryan and Aaron are great! In my opinion, Season 4 was the best, but all seasons are fine. In Season 1 we get to see Walter White breaking bad with his student/friend. In Season 2 we get to see progress on streets with their product And on the very end we get to see them meet the protagonist, and later antagonist Gustavo Fring. And that's Season 3 and the big meth lab they work in, and a new partner that will eventually replace Walter. What does Walter do? Kills him. Or orders a kill. Heisenberg taking over. In Season 4 we get to see stuff with Gustavo twisting, until his death and another Heisenberg moment. People say Walter White dies in that episode. And Season 5 - the masterpice. Enjoyed every single minute of it. Recommended to EVERYONE! I started to watch reruns of Breaking Bad because I had never watched it before. How did I not find this show earlier, I don't know. I am proud to say that not many television shows, or even films, handle a concept like this with such amazing depth and great writing.<br/><br/>I remember that whenever Bryan Cranston would win the Emmy award again and again I would seriously wonder what was so great about this man. Of course, things like this always happen. I can say that Cranston is giving one of the best performances to ever hit the small screen. The writers have given him a character that rises and challenges him and he has very admirably risen up to the challenge. He is undeniably powerful. I also want to give a shout out to Aaron Paul, who next to Cranston plays very well and has also risen above to create probably the most unforgettable and sympathetic druggie in a long time. The rest of the supporting cast also is great and are able to handle their characters magnificently well, especially Anna Gunn who has to deal with Cranston's always-erratic behavior. <br/><br/>The direction and writing in the show are top-notch and one is really surprised by how much you care and are involved by the characters. The cinematography is of the quality of an Oscar-winning film, as is the editing and the other technical aspects of the show. I do not see myself ever leaving this show because I know that the writers will never let me or any of the other fans down. Long live Breaking Bad, and AMC for creating some of TV's best stories. This has got to be one of the worst TV shows of all time. What do you people see in it? I wanted all the characters killed off except for Saul and the cop. Plot's dull. Story lines stupid. The women characters are weak and the show make them all look like bickering airheads. Maybe it's because USA is full of druggies and that's why they like it so much? Games of Thrones and Hell on Wheels are thousand times better than this terrible, terribleshow. There's wit and substantive dialogue. I had a terrible migraine after finishing the 2nd season of Breaking Bad. Maybe people can related b/c they all do drugs. I don't know. I'm still trying to figure this out. Really was boring, I think this will get a lot of dislikes but that's what I'm going for with this one.<br/><br/>It's just so overrated in my opinion that I can't actually believe it became so popular. Breaking Bad made a rocket jump from "indie" drama to mainstream success. This would be great if the series was any good, but it's not. It's not bad either, it's just very mediocre. Which is sad, because some of the episodes are unexpected and gruesomely great. Breaking Bad just might be one of the most overrated series you'll ever see on TV. <br/><br/>Breaking Bad has a doubtful plot. The premise is a chemistry teacher with cancer who decides to make drugs to provide for his family. This sounds like a fun, dark and bizarre premise, but the only thing bizarre about it is how "realistically" it's executed. Vince Gilligan has decided to make Breaking Bad too grim for its own good. There are few laughs to be had and the dark humor isn't that good.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad isn't entirely humorless, it just starts off dead serious. The life of the White family is tragic. They're financially indisposed and can barely pay the bills. It is later revealed that White had the potential to be rich of his scientific theories, but was "ripped off". <br/><br/>Since the series try to be realistic it's strange that White doesn't just apply to a university to an university job to begin with since he has such amazing chemistry competence (Good Will Hunting anyone?). True, he doesn't know how long he'll live, but the world of drugs is new to him and he knows nothing about it. His decisions to therefore make drugs as an "easy buck" is a hilariously unbelievable one.<br/><br/>Longevity is a flaw in Breaking Bad. The series just doesn't justify six seasons, when the majority of these seasons involves painful melodrama. There are ridiculous amounts of this that seems to just be there to stretch the series out. I don't want to see Hank's wife stealing stuff in stores or Walter's wife having an affair with her boss, because it's boring. Walter's family issues are especially tedious, with him constantly getting in trouble with his wife, and having to lie to his son. It's neither very heartbreaking or shocking.<br/><br/>The good scenes are when things get action-packed. In one scene White makes a chemical reaction that makes a medium sized explosion to show one of the bad guys, Tuco, that he means business. In another one, one of the villains, Gus Fring, poisons one of the cartel leaders to avenge his late restaurant "brother". These scenes are satisfactory and makes up for some, but unfortunately not all, of the melodrama.<br/><br/>Concerning the characters, the villains are some of the best ones. Gus Fring is creepy as a calm, but terrifying restaurant owner. Tuco is a drugged-out crazy who snorts drugs off his knife. They are horrific and unpredictable.<br/><br/>Jessie Pinkman, the anti-hero besides White, is also good. He is troubled, and we gain sympathy for him, even though he isn't the sharpest tool in the shed and is often doing drugs or complaining.<br/><br/>The other characters are bland. I gain no sympathy what so ever for Walter's wife, son or Hank's kleptomaniac spouse. Hank's wife is annoying and dumb, and has nothing to do in a series that involves a battle between the DEA and the Cartel. White's son does nothing special, and is just there to show off White's guilt. White's wife is a burden and messes up White's entire plan in the end.<br/><br/>Walter White himself, on the other hand, I found to actually be too big of an idiot to gain sympathy for. He's going from good to bad during the series, but he also seem to drop IQ points along the way. He goes from a rational human being to an irrational idiot. His decisions aren't reckless, which must be the intention, they are flat out stupid. In one scene, Walter drives around like he's a teenager again in his son's sports car and lands in the dirt. How does he resolve the situation you ask? He ignites the car and calls a cab. What a bad-ass. In another scene he goes crazy and refuses to work because of a fly. He never goes crazy like this again, so the episode was just there to stall the series. <br/><br/>In conclusion, there's way too much space between the bad parts and the good parts in Breaking Bad. If you're fine with suffering through four episodes in a row of Walter White acting stupid and endless melodrama before you see an awesome gory action scene, then Breaking Bad might might be a near-perfect 9.6/10 (Imdb score). But if you want to watch Breaking Bad because you want something different than the horrid melodrama from Gossip Girl, Breaking Bad is some of the most frustrating hours you'll have watching TV. You'll want to skip all the bad scenes and then risk losing track of where the plot is going. Well directed, good acting, good pacing and storyline was great until for me the point it went from perfect to just good was when Walter just didn't step up and become the apparent danger and the apparent one who knocks. I was waiting for it to happen and he just made bad decision after bad decision to the point I stopped caring for his character. Same with Jesse. So by the end I really didn't care what happened to either of them. Nobody gained from all that build up not the viewer of any of the characters. Would have been nice for just one thing to have gone to plan but even Walters big rescue ended as a flop with him taking friendly fire.<br/><br/>It was good but at the end of the day it was a show about a loser with a good idea who continued losing. To be invested in the show for so long there should be a payoff for the viewer and I guess for those who like seeing people fail and lose that payoff is there if they invested in Walter but in the end I just didn't care. I went from rooting for him to feeling awful for him and on edge to just not caring which makes me wonder what the point of the show was. I'm a pessimist in real life so expect something more when watching a show.<br/><br/>In my opinion true detective hit the nail on the head. 10/10 for acting, direction, storyline and writing where you feel conflicted about the characters but there's a satisfying resolution in the end.<br/><br/>Also Fargo for a show where the main character doesn't win but there's a satisfying end (along with top class acting and direction) I gave this until the first episode of season 3. I understand that Walt is supposed to be an antihero but you should still care about the character. I couldn't find a single redeeming quality in any character. I was so disappointed to have wasted 20 hrs of my life. After countless months of everyone talking about breaking bad, and hearing so much about the show, I decided I just had to give in and check it out.<br/><br/>I'm currently almost finished season 3, and to be honest, I don't think I can take much more of it. I mean I'm 3 seasons in and that "WOW, did that just happen?!" moment hasn't happened yet, and to be honest I don't think it will.<br/><br/>It's over-hyped for sure - I mean for this to get a 9.5 on IMDb, I think a few people were smoking some of that blue meth, because I just don't see it.<br/><br/>It gets very boring at times, and there's no real character development. Most of the central characters aren't very likable. The whole story just doesn't make sense - and every move the characters make, I can't help but wondering why? because it just doesn't seem like something they'd do.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, it's not a horrible programme. Despite the flaws, it's a decent watch, but I just can't get hooked on it. Will I continue to watch it? I don't know. But it's not a 9.5 programme. Metacritc gave it a 70 which is probably about right. I guess it appeals to airheads, and gives meth-heads a voice. 6.8/10 I've started watching this because some people suggested it's the next best thing to Lost, but I was slightly intrigued how big a difference between the quality of the two really is. I'm not saying Breaking Bad is not good, I'm saying it's just not that good. The acting of most lead actors is great, chemistry between them is nothing to complain about, it's just that the show won't nail you to your seat. It goes from fast paced criminal action of Walt killing a drug dealer to long talks of his wife about one boring thing to another. You could basically condense the show to the half of it's runtime without losing any relevant information. It's not that there isn't much going on, it's just that it's a talkie, it's about resolving issues, new issues popping up, resolving some older issues, something happens, resolve some more issues, come to a dead end, resolve other issues. I feel cheated. I was promised a show with a chemistry professor becoming criminal, but I got a show in which as we learn, everybody has issues. It's tough to watch sometimes, so sometimes I skip through bits. Mostly those including Skyler. That shouldn't happen - I never, not in a single episode, skipped bits of Lost.<br/><br/>I would recommend this show to... people who like talk shows like Oprah, who like shows like Sex and the city or Desperate housewives. Breaking bad is packed with dialog and relationship related issues. There a zillion reviews on this show , but to sum up this is a masterpiece a once in a lifetime show<br/><br/>What Godfather is to films this show is the father of TV shows . Obviously a cult classic show and I am very late to the party here. I actually began watching Better Call Saul first and when I learned it was a prequel to this show, then started watching Breaking Bad. I might be one of the only people in the world to watch these shows in this order, but I found it worked well. At least I understand the Cinnabon sequences in Better Call Saul now.<br/><br/>As an actual, real life chemist (that has been asked dozens of times if I watch Breaking Bad), I tend to avoid shows like this to avoid Hollywood's generalized clumsy depiction of science/scientists. But, this show doesn't suffer too much for what Hollywood's idea of a "chemist" is supposed to be.<br/><br/>That being said, I do have to take some issue with the Walter White character's background. Brilliant chemists that specialize in X-ray crystallography are generally not also uber synthetic organic chemists. And most chemists that are used to academia and lab scale don't just pick up mechanized industrial processes/machinery and run a lab like they had under the lavanderia. This show exhibits a pretty basic lack of knowledge about how specialization works in chemistry. Even more, a brilliant organic/inorganic chemist (apparently also responsible for a startup) on Walter White's level certainly doesn't end up as a high school teacher. This type of talent almost always goes tenure track to an R1 school or into industry to make a lot of money. Heck, you don't even need a PhD to teach chemistry in high school! I wasn't really convinced that he "loved teaching" enough to have picked such an odd career path for his pedigree (despite the love triangle that they kinda sorta tried to set up with him/Gretchen/Gray Matter to "explain" it).<br/><br/>Aside from that, the casting worked really well for this show and the acting was generally fantastic. I really enjoyed Giancarlo Esposito as Gus Fring, Jonathan Banks as Mike Ehrmantraut, Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman, Betsy Brandt as Marie Schrader, and Dean Norris as Hank Schrader. I thought maybe the best performance was Mark Margolis as Hector "Tio" Salamanca--he managed to play his role with basically just face twitches, opening and closing his eyes, sniffling, and ringing a bell. It was amazing.<br/><br/>I also really thought they made good use of music and had some pretty good opening scenes for quite a few of the episodes. The openings about the fly and Wendy the meth head stand out.<br/><br/>The two characters I ended up liking least were actually Anna Gunn's Skyler White and Bryan Cranston's Walter White. With Skyler, it was less about Anna Gunn and more that the character was just so annoying, thick-headed and selfish for about the first 2 seasons before sort of redeeming herself with the Beneke shakedown thing and car wash thing. She was really hard to like after making her husband's initial cancer diagnosis all about her and her feelings before he ever got into doing any of the really bad stuff. Then cheating with Ted right about the time things were getting toward even keel didn't make any sense either. I had a hard time imagining how Skyler and Walter ever would've become a couple in the first place.<br/><br/>With Cranston I found that as the episodes rolled on, he really grated on me. I thought he was guilty of over-acting. Really annoyingly obvious over-acting. Oh the melodrama! I oftentimes pictured him acting in a Broadway show, but then again he can overdo it just playing a dentist on Seinfeld. The constant touching of his face, flying off the handle at a moment's notice, the waterworks. Some of the issues I had were with how the Walter White character was totally inconsistent about whether he was going to make a cold, cunningly calculated decision or make a series of really idiotic ones (really, driving to your stashed millions because Pinkman sends a text message like that? I have a difficult time thinking he wouldn't have seen through that. How he'd leave an autographed copy of Gale's book in his bathroom). I felt that Walter White just being straight up with Skyler and Jesse would've basically ensured his meth empire ad inifnitum, but he had to keep lying about stupid things to estrange them. Didn't really seem to fit. Ditto with Pinkman and Huell snitching late in season 5. It didn't quite fit that the clueless DEA were now all of a sudden much smarter than an operation that had routinely outsmarted them at each turn. And, the cancer thing ended up just being a red herring. Which kinda sucks because that was the entire motivation for the character's actions.<br/><br/>The final quibble I had with the show was that season 5 was a little bit all over the place. It was almost like the Gus Fring saga in season 4 turned out to be so compelling, they felt they needed to top that somehow in season 5. I think I would've preferred the show ending after season 4. I wasn't really a fan of the 'Hank finds out about Walter' dynamic. I thought Hank's character was better served being unable to figure it out. They went a little bit too hard on the "try to hold onto anything, lose control of everything" philosophy.<br/><br/>All that being said, I don't want to sound overly negatively. This show was plenty compelling and watchable. I rate it an 8. Other than gutting out an odd episodes here or there it was almost never boring and the story kept moving. I like the main character Mr White a lot. This TV shows show how a good heart man gradually change himself to a bad guy. Sometimes, you have to do some bad things because you don't have a choice. A funny is that they really did a website which is used to gather the donation for Mr White. But actually, I think Mr White is a big bad guy who let so many people die and finally, he got his bad outcome. Besides, Gustavo Fring who sell the fired chicken. He is the real hero. He revenge after he got power. He defeat the enemy by his own! Comparing to Gustavo, Mr White is just a vile character. And his wife is really bad wife who makes me angry for many times. In summary, this is a really good TV shows, it is worthwhile to watch it. You can talk to people when you have meals with them. I watched this show after I saw that it was rated a 9.5 on here and I must say that I was not disappointed! Right from the first episode where Walter White (Bryan Cranston) was standing in his underwear pointing a gun at a non-existent enemy all the way to the final showdown that ended this addicting series, there was not a single episode where I wasn't glued to the screen.<br/><br/>The characters were brilliant and complex, and the actors who portrayed them were legendary. Not to mention that the show was very funny at times too! This series had everything from me clawing at my chair in anticipation of what was going to happen next to me cracking up laughing uncontrollably. If you're looking for a roller coaster that will leave you wanting more, this show is for you! For those like me who also want more, they have Better Call Saul now too! Breaking Bad is not just a TV show. It is a masterpiece. 62 episodes of pure and intense drama, epic moments and incredible performances. Walter White, Jesse Pinkman...these 2 names will remain forever in our hearts. A regular chemistry teacher to turn into a drug dealer? Who believed that this is the premise for the greatest adventure? From the first to the last episode you can not predict what will happen next time. Is so unpredictable and you will enjoy it. This is the best you can see on TV. It clearly deserves the title of "the best show ever made". <br/><br/>Breaking Bad is the one who knocks! Protagonist turns antagonist! The show starts off at a low pace in the first season. Most people might get bored and never watch further. But that's where you need to have a little patience. The story takes a dive into "keeping you glued" phase after that. Initially, Walt seems to be a lovable character. All his actions seem justified. Anything and everything for a family. But you are in for a little surprise there, later in the series.According to me, Jesse Pinkman is the BEST character of the series. Top notch acting, perfect portrayal of such a role requires a lot. Many of you might hate the character Skyler White from midway of the 3rd season, but she was always right! Till the end of 4th season Walt does everything possible to save himself and his family from Gustavo fring, the primary villain until then. But from 5th season on wards, I started to develop a certain sense of hatred for Walt. I mean you cant do anything for the sake of family. Greed, ego, too much family oriented reasons may make you hate him. He did everything for family only, accepted, but the level to which he drops is just not right. When he poisons Brock, he gets Hank killed and adding to that he lies with a straight face. No guilt. No regret. But Bryan Cranston's act was amazing. He is the perfect guy for this role. While approaching the end of the show, I wished that Walt shouldn't live, but it seemed otherwise from earlier episodes of season 5, but when Walt dies at the end(it was actually unclear as they just show his body on the ground with camera zooming out, so i presumed he died) a sense of relief overwhelmed me! He deserved to die. Jesse Pinkman was the main protagonist throughout the series for me. It was a bummer he didn't get as much attention on his personal life in the show as much as Walt did. All in all a tremendous show, which could've been a 10/10 if I hadn't started hating Walter White. Things we do for the FAMILY!!! Best TV Series Ever I Have Watched MR White is just an awesome person his acting is remarkable.....<br/><br/>congratulations to Vince Gilligan And thanks for making Breaking Bad...<br/><br/>The age of Bryan Cranston has returned. Once universally lauded for his work in Malcolm In The Middle, there had yet to be a good vehicle for this man's particular talents. He has that rare gift of generating sympathy and manic-energy at the same time.<br/><br/>For those that would be content to label this show a Weeds knock- off, bear in mind that Breaking Bad is a new kind of monster. It touches on the very same themes, "living realistically as a middle class in the United States" which often makes us resort to extremes to survive. Like the mother and daughter team that robbed that bank. But the weed selling antics of Showtime's hit show is really nothing like "Bad." The Pilot was about as perfect a Pilot as I've ever seen, and much of it rests on Bryan Cranston's shoulders.<br/><br/>Cranston plays Cheimstry teacher Walter White. He has a loving wife, a child with Cerebal Palsy and another is on the way. He also happens to be dying from an inoperable lung cancer situation, which happened although he "never smoked." His finances in disarray, the once great student of science turns to crime to solve his problems.<br/><br/>He cooks Crystal Meth with a good for nothing ex-student. From the antics of the first episode, the show is leading towards a dark place, but a place of truth. This is a no nonsense black comedy.<br/><br/>For people that love Tarantino or the Coen's, this might be your cup of tea Breaking Bad is the best TV Show ! The best Casting Ever, people perform well. Bryan Cranston was for this. Jesse and all others. We have to admit it. Giancarlo was simply perfect in his character, Simple, Great. He was perfect for this also. I was hoping for a season six but I think the end say it all. Vince you're the best writer. All episode was wonderful. Each episode watched make you say 'another one'. You just can't sleep. Especially in the season four and five. Skyler sometimes, she asked too much and Marie just make me out of my mind but I think it was the point. I almost cried when they shoot Hank. If they didn't I think we could reach season eight but it's done. I'm waiting for another TV show like that. Breaking Bad displays perfection in every way possible. From the memorable multi- dimensional characters portrayed with excellent acting to the brilliant plot that is thoughtfully constructed so that every season, episode and second fits together perfectly. It's for any audience, from the analytical minded who consider all of the underlying messages, to the people who just want to watch a good story. While watching, it's impossible for anyone to not acknowledge the genius that comes from the makers of this show. To this day I haven't seen a better TV show and I really don't believe I'll ever see one better than this Breaking Bad This show is amazing. Honestly, anyone who is willing to invest this much time into a TV show should invest it in this show. It won't always be nice to the viewer, it won't let you breathe somehow, it will keep you waiting, it will break your heart and it will make viewers reflect on our long history of watching movies passively and criticize our neutrality. Breaking Bad is accessible to the average viewer but rewards the active watcher. The story is a Greek tragedy dressed with a modern coating, creating and slowly dehumanizing the "protagonist" Walter White into someone the viewer usually despises. This show is all about change and brings the audience for the ride where we visually and emotionally witness the change of Heisenberg. The cinematography is breathtaking and personal, the performances are jaw dropping and sincere and the story is a down to earth modern tragedy. Just watch it, do yourself a favor. I may not have watched hundreds of TV shows, but this one is certainly the greatest of them all. Excellent cinematography, brilliant direction, Oscar-worthy performances, great background songs, fantastic dialog, outstanding mix of humor, action, drama, romance and tension, mind-blowing twists, and overall the most perfect TV show ever created. Every actor is excellent, even those who appear for only a couple of episodes, absolutely outstanding villains, fantastic story, every single shot is golden, and it's the show that put basically every actor who was on the show a worldwide hit. This show can make you cry, laugh, get chills, fell intense, put your on the edge of your sit, scream and much more. This show is an absolute gold. I watched it twice and every time you remember why this show is much more than perfect. Talk about a television show that got people talking. I haven't met anyone that at one time or another didn't bring up this show. When I saw the CNN report of people calling 911 because of a power outage during the final episodes of Breaking Bad, I knew this show was really special. If you haven't heard of it or seen it, do yourself a favor and take a weeks' vacation and watch it. There are several seasons, so make sure that you start from the beginning and enjoy every episode. At times things might seem to be a bit cruel, but that is what this drug business is all about. When there is a large sum of money involved, a lot of people want to get their share of it. You will feel bad for some of the characters in this show and you will feel sadness for others and there will be times when you feel like standing up and screaming, but it all makes this show one of the best you will ever witness. Hope you enjoy it. It seems pretty clichÃ©d to say that Breaking Bad is one of the best shows ever, but I just couldn't help it. I adore this show! The show is about a chemistry teacher at a high school in Albuquerque, New Mexico, named Walter White who has lung cancer and needs money to support his family for when he dies. He sees how much money the meth industry promises and he decides to cook meth with an old student of his named Jesse. Walt soon realizes that the meth industry is not a walk in the park and he faces against a lot of villains, outside conflict, and family drama at home. Not only is the premise really smart and dark, but the actors are amazing, especially Bryan Cranston as Walter White. He kills it every time and he is both evil and sympathetic at the same time. The great thing about this show is that you never know how the characters are going to get out of the situations that they are put in. It keeps you on the edge of your seat. The drama is intense and filled with tension. Its not an action show, its an intense drama that has violent moments that may sometimes be kind of graphic for some viewers. Its not cringe- worthingly graphic like The Walking Dead, Game of Thrones, or Sons of Anarchy, but its still very effective. The episode plots are just great, and suspenseful. I can't really think of an episode that was bad or okay. There are some episodes that are kind of slow, but they are character development episodes that help advance the plot and keep the show moving forward. I will say that the first season is a little slow, but after episode 5, it picks up and gets more interesting and there are only 7 episodes in season 1. The cinematography is wonderful. This is what I am loving about TV shows that are on AMC, HBO, FX, Netflix, and Showtime; their shows look like movies. Its very cinematic and it has unforgettable moments that most Hollywood movies wish they had. Vince Gilligan is just a brilliant creator and writer who really made one of the best shows of all time. Everyone involved with this show did a fantastic job. I definitely recommend this show to whoever is interested. Its one of my favorite shows and I am glad I saw it. It gets a 10/10 from me! Extremely good show.<br/><br/>I think this is the best show I have ever seen in my life and it is very difficult that another show steal this position.<br/><br/>It is like a combination between Drama, Action, Comedy, Thriller.<br/><br/>It is absolutely everything.<br/><br/>Definitely recommend everyone to watch it.<br/><br/>The director succeeded to attract me until the end of the show. The first parts of the show was a little bit boring. However, by the time you will feel that you cannot stop watching the rest of the episodes to see what will happen after all. Breaking bad is The greatest show ever created. Perfection in every detail. It's an experience of great cinematographic art and character development. The intensity and drama will ensnare you. Yet the black comedy will make you laugh. This show is all it could be and will stand in history as one of the most amazing TV-series ever made.<br/><br/>And the cast... Never forget the cast. Every actor and actress fills their parts with great success! With the great Bryan Cranston in the role of his life.<br/><br/>The show was perfect, all bad things must come to an end. And what an end.<br/><br/>I think the only bad thing in breaking bad is it has an end , i'd never like to stop watching this masterpiece . Breaking Bad is without a doubt my favourite TV show of all time! You simply cannot beat Vince Gilligan when it comes to directing, you cannot beat Bryan Cranston with his outstanding acting skills and you definitely cannot beat Aaron Paul's mind-blowing character Jesse Pinkman. The detail that Vince Gilligan went into with Breaking Bad proves he is one of the worlds most talented directors. For example the similarity between Gustavo Fring having his face blown off in the episode comically named "Face Off" to the iconic teddy bear missing an eye in the episode "ABQ". Overall I would definitely recommend Breaking Bad to every single human. This is not a serial. It is actually a 45+ hours long movie!!!! Well, I haven't exactly counted the hours and minutes, but 62 episodes, each approx. 45 minutes, so give or take...<br/><br/>Very intriguing and unique plot, superb direction, perfect castings and superior performance of all casts. But the three actors are by far the most outstanding of all. They are 1) Arron Paul playing Jessie Pinkman, 2) Dean Morris playing DEA Agent Hank Schrader and 3) Bob Odenkirk as Lawyer Saul Goodman. When these actors are on the screen, you couldn't take your eyes off them. If Breaking Bad was actually a movie, these three would be De facto owners of Oscar nominations. They are razor sharp in their respective characters. Bob Odenkirk has striking resemblance of Adam Sandler and he is superbly funny.<br/><br/>Every episode keeps full grip on you. Barring a few short fillers, all episodes are non-stop intense and grasp your full attention.<br/><br/>This is the "Shawshank Redemption" of TV serials! Every one must watch. Never in my life have I come across a series as perfect as this one. I have watched numerous series, and this is the one that has taken the first position of them all. Man, how did they ever create a series so enthralling, that I didn't even feel the time fly. I has to sit and watch the entire series in less than two months, and now I regret on the haste. Because it was bloody brilliant. <br/><br/>Hank, Jesse, Anna, Flynn, Gus, Mike.....all characters of perfection. And Walter White? He was the man. He became an employee of the devil. Then he became the devil, and ends as a mere man. I multiple levels, this is a perfect philosophical drama as well. Perfection is every frame, and every bit of the story is simply perfect.<br/><br/>This is perfectly bad! The greatest series for one to watch! I loved all 62 episodes of the show. The script is so well written. The actor bring such amazing emotion to the critical scenes. I love watching walter transform. Breaking bad is brilliant. Favorite episode: SEASON 5, episode 14. The episode shows just how far we have came since season one. How hank has to suffer because of walt. How walt looses everything ! His family. His money. He screws Jesse over. The episode is emotional and thrilling. I am so thankful for Vince Gilligan. Breaking bad is my #1 show. The best show you will ever watch. Slow burning genius! Only other show to have strong plot and impact is my second favorite show Prison Break. The thing we I found most relevant to breaking bad was character development. EVERY character development. It was great. Walt is the Anti -Hero that we love, we root him on, and yet he makes us regret it by showing his bad side. BRYAN Cranston. My new favorite actor. The whole cast is just great.I am excited for better call saul. Sad breaking bad is over. Thrilled in knowing it television history! Season 1&2 are mind blowing good. Though Season 2 is slightly uneven between episodes , the overall impression is coherent and some episodes even stand out as some the best of the whole series.<br/><br/>Episode 3 Is a major change in pace and a very obvious brain-drain in both direction and the all important drama becomes scetchy and loses a lot of flow compared to Season 1&2 ,wich the actors in no way are to blame. They are indeed making the process somewhat believable despite the over-the-top cuts between scenes,moods and the gradual brakedown of the portrayed characters. I am still to watch season 4 in full (There is season 5 also) And Season 4 in this moment (Episode 3) is moving towards more display of blood sputtering then the smart psychological thriller "Braking Bad" started out with in season 1&2. Sad but true. OH my god, a show never put me this much on edge before... and made me cry for near death of a supporting character. I never watched anything so real in my life, and I can fully understand why critics and everyone say this show is number one. Breaking Bad, I recommend this show to anyone. The writing is flawless and superb, it deters away from any writer's flaws. It has left me on edge every season wanting more. It does not leave you hanging, questions are answered in the same episode nearly. I honestly don't know if I can watch anything else without complaining about how faulty the scripting is. If you haven't watched the show, please do, it'll be the best thing you have ever watched in your whole life. If there is one show which has absolutely no flaws throughout the series, it has to be Breaking Bad. The show just kept on improving from earlier seasons. 2nd was better than 1st, 3rd than 2nd, 4th than 3rd and 5th was the ultimatum. Nevertheless, all the seasons were just mind blowing. I loved the transformation of Walter White in to Heisenberg. The same guy who thought $737,000 was what enough to support his family after he is gone, even millions couldn't cater his thirst. The scene in which he says "Just, say my Name" in S5 just gave me goose bumps even for a second viewing. Each and every character in the series was there for a reason and each of them had their presence felt. That's what is magnificent about the series. Casting is brilliant and acting is top notch. I don't think there is any other actor who could portray Walter White as Bryan Cranston did. Hands down!! <br/><br/>I strongly recommend it. For me, Breaking Bad just found a string inside and grabbed onto my soul. I loved watching this show. I loved every episode, each one being unique and great in Its own way and there was never a dull episode. This was a special show, and I just can't say enough about it. Breaking Bad is mainly about high school chemistry teacher and meth manufacturer Walter White. Walt's character has so much depth to it. The writers really do a fantastic job at developing his and all of the other characters into some of the most memorable characters I've ever seen. Walter White is one of those rare characters that just stuck with me long after the show ended and is one of my favorite characters of all time. The actors who portray these people are tremendous, and I can't think of any cast member who gave a poor performance. Bryan Cranston as Walt was absolutely phenomenal. He did such a great job, and he deserves any and all praise he gets. I thought Aaron Paul was also one who stood out as Jesse Pinkman. And even though he was only in four episodes, I thought Raymond Cruz as Tuco was outstanding. Tuco's character was one of the best and most enjoyable to watch in my opinion. The way this show is filmed is also excellent. It looks like a well-made movie and there is some great cinematography present throughout the series. The music that they add in is spot-on. They pick the best music for every situation throughout every episode and every season. Probably the best thing about the show is the story. Every episode is fun to watch and the story is just so fascinating and captivating. They develop their characters so nicely and quickly that the show becomes great almost right away. This show has meaning behind it, and someone with an eye for detail can understand and see the little things that are added in. Like the show Mad Men, you really have to pay attention to catch everything, although Breaking Bad has more action to it than Mad Men. Overall, Breaking Bad is great, and it portrays itself in such an interesting and incredible way that one can't help but become addicted to the characters and scenarios. I would recommend this show to anyone mature enough to catch small details and doesn't mind watching despicable people who do despicable things. Breaking Bad was a special and thought-provoking show that will go down as one of my favorite things to have ever seen on screen, television or cinema. Yes a bold statement, but trust me I have watched loads of TV shows over the years.<br/><br/>Sopranos, Six feet Under, The Wire, The Shield, BSG, Game of Thrones, you know where I'm going. <br/><br/>Great TV shows all of them, but BB is the show that tops them all. The characters from season 1 to Season 5.2 change and develop so much, more than any show I've watched in the past. <br/><br/>And if you love cliff hanger endings, it seems every episode ends on one.<br/><br/>You've never seen anything like it in your life. An utterly amazing piece of work that has left a massive hole in my life.<br/><br/>You need BB in your life, that's all I'm saying.<br/><br/>PS. One crumb of comfort, Gus is in Revolution!! The show is astonishing, the actors are great and interpret their characters perfectly. You will be always guessing what will be happen next and most of the times you will be wrong. It plays with your feelings like no other show or film ever did. And in the end the people that watched the series will have a different opinion of Walt and the other characters. It's a story of a man who started with the goal to provide for his family but ended liking it more than anything and even tho he still had it's goal in his mind what drove him was his taste and its power. The details are so important and are always present and you then interpret them as you want. The relationship between Jesse and Mr White its brilliant, Its so well architected you will sometimes hate Walt and love Jesse and the opposite. It's truly a masterpiece, and its a Mind Blowing must see. I procrastinated watching this show when a friend recommended it and I regret it so much. The show had me hooked from the very first episode. I loved everything from the storyline to the casting and direction. <br/><br/>I think the main thing that interested me is the drastic character development of Walter White and how evil takes over his relatable original character gradually through every season. Even though Walter was my main interest at first I started to favour other characters like Jesse, Hank, Mike and Gus. By the end of the show, I developed a reverence for Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul as actors. <br/><br/>In my opinion this show is a modern retelling of the book of Job but in this case the suffering inflicts a breaking point on the protagonist and it is thought-provoking when Walter White describes this as being "awake". This makes me wonder if everyone has a context where they would "break bad" and I don't necessarily mean break the law but their own ethos. What to say about this series...every single word is truly less to describe how good is Breaking Bad. Hats off to Vince Gilligan for creating such a masterpiece series.The actors were extremely superb. Bryan Cranston was awesome as Mr. White. Aaron Paul was quite a big surprise.His role keeps growing more and more intense,funnier,loving and he really done a fantastic work.Now talking about all the seasons... It started great in the first and a bit slow in the second may be its the story demands...but it keeps surprising us all.The Ending Was Fantastic.Actually You will never get bored except some moments. One cannot predict whats going to happen next. All the characters starting Mr. and Mrs white,Flynn,Hank,Marie,Drug Cartel,Gus,Mike and all played excellent and Honestly made their characters real and outstanding. Actually i am falling out of Adjectives here to show my deep regards and respect to this show and its whole cast and crew. Its A benchmark to the TV Serials. A must watch for all... Its really Good to see Breaking Bad Here's how to enjoy this to the maximum extent; 1,Sign up for Netflix one month free. 2.Visit the local hospital and steal a supply of liquid food with an intravenous drip 3. Get a trained professional to hook you up in the basement 4. unplug the phone 5.Start from the very first episode and don't leave until you're up to 2012 ('cos that's as far as it goes on Netflix) 6. Have your wife check in on you from time to time over the next three days to change the drip and give you a sponge bath. 7.prepare yourself to be a changed person when you re-enter society.<br/><br/>Quite simply one of the best series I have ever seen; acting superb on all fronts , plot and scripting brilliant, suspense tingling, scenery haunting. Can this really be the same guy we saw as a dentist on Seinfeld so many years ago? It's amazing how the absence of any sort of commercial break makes a show so much more enjoyable. You know maybe I can use Netflix to watch the Kardashians and Total Divas or even Jersey Shore.. I my have misjudged them just because of the intrusive advertisements... and then I woke up! The perfect series! I just discovered this whole mind blowing thing one year ago, but it hooked me in right after the pilot already. So I watched it 24/7 because I wanted to finish with it until the date of the series finale. I was even faster and I had the opportunity to watch the very last five episodes in time... Amazing story, magnificent acting, tremendous music. Everything in its right place. If you want to see only one series, I recommend to start with this. But you will be in danger, because you won't find another series until you finished watching Breaking Bad... Before I discovered BB, Dexter was my favorite, but they totally screwed up with the last season so I went awfully disappointed about it. What can I say about Breaking Bad that hasn't already been said? It's easily one of the most addictive shows ever to come on air, and that's mainly down to the actors. The dialogue written for them and then spoken is flawless, there isn't a line too many in the whole thing. When there's just silence, the reactions by each of the actors to what's going on keeps the whole thing captivating. <br/><br/>Bryan Cranston, who was, before this, mainly just known for the X-Files and Malcolm in the Middle, was perfectly cast, and it's done so well you can easily sympathize with him, but, as it goes on, when he starts to change more and more into Heisenberg, you start to hate him, and Cranston's flawless performance was what made this happen. The rest of the cast are equally good, from the hot-headed Aaron Paul, to the well-meaning but dangerous Dean Norris, to the concerned and independent housewife Anna Gunn. <br/><br/>The music really adds something else to it, using a great selection of songs that just fit the mood of the storyline being told at that time. Although the directors frequently change from episode to episode, the show has a great consistency from the style to the tempo.<br/><br/>As Walter White said at the beginning of season 1, "Chemistry is the study of change", we can do nothing but watch as Walter White, a dull high school professor transforms, over the course of 62 episodes, into a ruthless meth cook who tries to explain all his actions with simple excuses. But if you haven't watched it yet, then what's your excuse? Iv been hearing very good reviews about braking bad for a while now and seeing 9.5 on IMDb just made me a must watch on my TV shows to be watched list. I was pretty skeptical how would I present this to my wife as she loves to watch TV shows but reading short summary for Braking Bad made me overly cushion in which particular way will I approach to her. And boy did we have a blast on a five season marathon of pure TV show drama at it best :) I must say character developing in braking bad is just about as good as real life can offer. And drama, scripting, directing, casting, acting, music, plot development, twits it offers, wits in decision making, heart breaking moments, and at the end all things breaking bad just makes perfect sense in a world of Walter White and his family. I got a say that Bryan Cranston did outstanding job, performing his guts out making viewers to soak in like water in a sponge. What he did whit a Walter White character is just enormously, gigantic piece of art acting and he deserves to be put in TV shows annals as one of the best character acting of all times. He molds and twists hes charisma to the point that you just cant do better then it is :) And there is Jesse Pinkman - this guy slowly grows on you like a weed in a yard and it sticks whit you all the way to the end - you just cant get rid of him as much as you try - Aaron Paul is outstanding Jesse Pinkman to say the least :) Skyler (Anna Gunn) is beautifully incorporated as Walts beloved wife and she also get the same massive character development as Walt did - all those hard decisions Walt makes trough his career reflects on her as much as crystal clear mirror reflects our on image making us look for what we really are. Of Course, a joyable comedian of the show - Hank Schrader (Dean Norris) will make you feel on a threshold when the right time comes. The main thing, and this is why so many of us are hooked on breaking bad, besides the story, is how well taught and amazingly brilliant all those characters came together to form a master piece, a classic that will dwell in our minds for years to come :) Im absolutely overly stunned about how good this TV show is/was, and because of that Braking Bad is a must for all TV junkies out there - so prepare yourself for a ride of the decade and open your heart for truly amazing drama that will bring all the right emotions in you in just about perfect time. Enjoy! 3 Words to describe the show: Bitter. Sweet. Euphoria.<br/><br/>I haven't seen acting this good on a TV show. The filming is indescribable and the plot is so beautifully woven ...but it's so bad all at the same time. <br/><br/>You don't watch this show, you experience it with the characters.<br/><br/>Sometimes I can't believe I'm rooting for a ex-chemistry teacher turned meth cooker...but then I remember the Walt I met in season 1; a cancer patient who just wants to provide family...even after he's gone. If there ever was a noble meth cook, Walter White would be on my list.<br/><br/>Watch the very first 3 episodes and I promise you won't want to stop. There's a reason why it's critically acclaimed as the best TV show of our generation. There's a reason why it's won so many awards. There's a reason why I'm not even a fan of TV in general but I'm glued to the screen.<br/><br/>Hidden under the laughable AMC network, this show is truly a diamond in the rough. Breaking Bad created by Vince Gilligan and the happiest writers in Hollywood, is about Walter White, portrayed by Bryan Cranston. A Chemistry-genius, who is stuck in a dead end high school teacher job with a pregnant wife, Skylar, and a teenage son, Walt Jr, who has cerebral palsy. After he gets diagnosed with stage 3 lung cancer, Walter starts cooking the purest crystal meth in America with his partner Jesse Pinkman, Portrayed by Aaron Paul. Basically the whole plan that Vince Gilligan had for this show was to show a transformation from "Mr Chips to Scarface". It is the first time that a protagonist of a TV show has had such a drastic change from the beginning of the show to the end. Tony Soprano, Don Draper and Omar Little always stay the same person and never change which is why we are so interested in them. However Breaking Bad is all about change and transformation. Other than Walt, Jesse changes from a druggy man-child to a scarred man who has seen things that would even traumatize a gangster. Walt's DEA agent brother-in-law, Hank Schrader, also changes from a overweight joker who doesn't take his job seriously to one of the best investigators and bad-asses ever seen on television. Believe me half of the bad guys (Tuco, Salamanca twins) are killed by Hank in this show. Along with Walt, one of the best villains and characters I've ever seen is Gustavo Fring. There are many adversaries that Walt faces but none have ever been as dangerous as Gus Fring. A quiet force that likes to be well dressed and formal but is cold and calculating. The calmness that he had when he slit Victor's throat and blood sprayed across the room was truly disturbing. Then quietly taking a shower and cleaning himself up like there was nothing going on was truly frightening. Breaking Bad took the action that you normally see in blockbuster movies and made them better. The exploding non-meth scene with tuco, Walt running over the two drug dealers and, of course, the explosive death of Gus Fring and the final shootout with the Nazis were all shocking and amazing. Usually when I see TV shows or movies I think that that I can write better than what I see. I think anybody could have written a better finale for Dexter or have made the second season of The Walking Dead less boring. However Breaking Bad truly had some of the most flawless writing I have ever seen. Quite possibly only The Sopranos, The Wire and Game of Thrones have writing that is as good as Breaking Bad. In conclusion, Bryan Cranston truly deserves the awards and admiration he has received for his portrayal of Walter White AKA Heisenberg and Vince Gilligan truly made a masterpiece. The ending depicting the survival of Jesse and the death of Heisenberg was perfect and fitting. Breaking Bad is amazing! YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT!!! I was at a party last Saturday night and a friend said to me that he was going to get netflix so he can watch Breaking Bad. I thought, fair enough, finally you have come round to the sensible way of watching TV "on demand". I did not pay much attention to the watch Breaking Bad bit as was more concerned with having a few beers. The next day with a hangover in tow I was reading a blog post on Nicky Butt following the release of class of 92 (for American friends a documentary film on a group of players who came through the Man Utd youth system which included David Beckham) and he said he was glued to watching Breaking Bad so off I went to Netflix to start my marathon session. <br/><br/>So, you guessed it, I spent Xmas watching Breaking bad but I was battling the man flu, I'm not a sad pointless fool.<br/><br/>From the pilot to the final scene I was hooked like no other show I have seen. Storyline brilliance, superb casting and fantastic direction. What disturbs me more than anything else is the decision making of British TV execs who thought this show was not worthy of a prime time stint. Instead it was relegated to Netflix, which is not at all main stream yet in the UK. Why are us Brits subjected to such reality TV bobbins, when TV shows depicting the real world are shoved aside in this fashion.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad is great for many reasons, but perhaps the most important is its capability to hit home the do or die mentality of American society. A School teacher behaving in such a way is entirely plausible when there is no way out of the over capitalist health care system. While it is truly captivating to watch, as a Brit you always think it is entirely avoidable if the US thought a little differently.<br/><br/>Having said that where would we be without the intrigue of American society, the anything is possible way of life and the shear audacity of it all. You certainly keep us interested America but I do hope you change your health care system. There must be so many Americans who are contemplating drastic actions to survive.<br/><br/>Regardless of my political observations I must stress that this is the best TV show I have ever seen. End of! Perhaps it's the start of even more hard hitting dramas that are free from the corporate chains to communicate anything they like. There are very few TV shows that I get so engrossed in that I can't stop watching it. Breaking Bad is one of them<br/><br/>Never before have I watched a series that is done as well as this one. It has unexpected plot twists and unforeseen events that you could never guess. Very rarely is a TV show so brilliant and done so well. I would strongly recommend watching Breaking Bad!! It is a perfect, and I mean perfect blend of action and drama that will make you get addicted to it like nothing else. It has clif hangers that will leave you so speechless the only thing you will be able to do is watch the next episode. If you haven't started watching Breaking Bad yet, you should, you have no idea what you're missing. I am not into Television series. This was my first attempt and boy, did it blow my mind!<br/><br/>Every single factor about Breaking Bad is so fine and original and startling, I was addicted to it and still am. I could, if time permits, watch all episodes again and again. That is why the 100%, because this show can even make the most boring person find a reason to get smart.<br/><br/>With so much swag, the characters are well-written. Bryan Cranston is simply outstanding. Supporting cast is brilliant and the airs they carry with the portrayals is so charming, it is very hard to believe it is fiction. Aaron Paul's facial expressions, Dean Norris' funny physique and his laugh snorts, Anna Gunn's OMG emotions & her beauty are all simply amazing. RJ Mitte is fantastic.<br/><br/>Now, for the story, it is gold and this one shines, too. Every episode reveals something new about the chemistry involved in cooking crystal-drug, Walter White's familial problems and all that comes along. The little to grave dangerous adventures the two main characters set on towards the end of Season 1 is mind-boggling. And with the high- level of crime involved... I mean all sorts of crimes... the boldness overflows threshold and that is what works here!<br/><br/>The music, the cinematography, the direction & the cast performance together puts up to the startling birth & departure of a very good TV series. "Better Call Saul" will be good, eh?<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: Highly Recommended! And if you are planning to start a new series to watch, make it Breaking Bad! This is some serious entertainment stuff!<br/><br/>Can be watched with a typical Indian family? NO<br/><br/>Profanity: Strong | Vulgarity/Sex/Nudity: Strong | Violence/Gore: Very Critical | Smoking/Alcohol/Drugs: Infinity | Porn: Very Mild I really do not know what to talk about this series , I can only say that without a doubt is the best drama ever made in world television history , first place in the TOP 10 of IMDb, actors handpicked to bring an excellent job in which each actor fits perfectly into its proper character. Writers , producers , actors , directors , finally , the whole cast this great series is of congratulations, six years of work they earned several Emmys including best actors and best series dramatic . accompany Breaking Bad from the second episode of the third season and I have never been disappointed with this series. No doubt she deserves all notes 9.0 upwards you received , this was the only series that really thrilled me , thrill me , cheer , get angry by characters . Whether you are in doubt whether to attend or not , I do not know to say , is a series brilliant certainly but to us who look forward year by year , it was more exciting to stay in that anguish of "Well , now only next year ." Guess I'm rolling , but this is it.10/10 is my note .<br/><br/>As said AMC : " Thanks for making bad so good" Few times in the history of the world has mankind set out to construct something as grand as a 44-hour long (62 episode) movie. But this is a tale with a distinct beginning and ending, a story with perfect continuity, that has beat a hollow into humanities cave wall in which to perch itself for all of posterity. Each individual hour stands alone as a complete story, and each is woven masterfully through the whole epic saga. If you've seen just one episode, you know that no templates have been taken from modern entertainment in birthing this monster.<br/><br/>There is a place for every superlative in a review of Breaking Bad, but that template too will be found unfitting. This series is a body of work that simply and clearly has earned a prominent place in history, its bloodied its fingers and clawed and fought for it the whole way. The creators, crew, and cast of Breaking Bad have few to thank - and none to apologize to. This is their hill. They built it upon the bodies of low grade television, almost famous indie films, and oceans of mediocre entertainment in all forms. What is put on display turns out to be something very real and undeniably human, the stories, plots, sub-stories, diversions, and influences all melt into a near meaningless goo once the final credits roll and the truth of the tale is etched in granite.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad is an expose of modern man, and don't expect unicorns and rainbows here in the grit of the real world.<br/><br/>In the end Walt seems to have allegiance only to his partner in crime, and a mere business like association with his family. This, I feel, is the manifestation of the commitment he made in the very first episodes. He put it all on the line giving up on the 'normal life' for a quick buck, and lives and dies by that decision.<br/><br/>In the end, we have learned the difference between money and man.<br/><br/>As much as I've dreaded the end of the series, by god, it couldn't be any other way. I'm incredibly satisfied that the ending stitches closed what was opened in the beginning, making a whole of the thing, making it a gift to us all rather than being clutched greedily in a fizzling slide to obscurity. Gliding Over All, Just as Breaking Bad always has been.<br/><br/>Not since The Wire have I seen a show capable of expressing such a quickfire of different genres or emotions, this drama is of the highest class superior to all else.<br/><br/>The greatest to date, without equal. The conclusion reduced me to tears, and just showcased that even when Breaking Bad was ending, it could still force me to laugh and cry at consecutive times, within seconds(When Walt shoots Jack, and when Jesse drives from the lab).<br/><br/>It has changed me, and has also made me think twice about decision making, and helped me think of ways to stay one step ahead of a situation, even when you're looking despair in the face.<br/><br/>Goodbye Walt. Breaking bad managed to give me a rare, greedy feeling of wanting to watch more and more, but not wanting it to end. Never before have I felt so attached to every character; while at the same time being in total awe of the symbolism, depth, and balance between light comical moments and very dark scenes which have been seamlessly woven into the script. <br/><br/>Looking back on the journey through the lives of the characters in Albuquerque, I cant help but feel a real sense of nostalgia. <br/><br/>Well done to everyone who was involved in the creation of this series. To me this is the greatest television show ever created. This series crosses the boundary between television and fine art. Don't read this unless you have seen "Felina," the series finale of AMC's "Breaking Bad." From a structural standpoint, it's hard to be too hard on the "Breaking Bad" finale as a discrete unit. The last hour of the series took all the story threads that were still dangling and wrapped them up, not quite in an elegant bow -- more like a blood-drenched metal chain.<br/><br/>In the last few scenes, creator Vince Gilligan, who wrote and directed the finale, went with a Shakespearean solution, one of those "and then everybody died" situations that you find at the end of some of the Bard's plays. Out in the New Mexico desert, the bright, shining exception to the general bloodbath was Jesse, whose deliriously relieved exit from the Nazi compound was the best moment of the finale.<br/><br/>In many ways, that hour felt like the show's final destination; the story and the people went furthest they could go in a dozen ways. It placed many viewers (including myself) into an emotional and psychological vise and made "Game of Thrones'" Red Wedding look like a cocktail party. "Ozymandias" was hard to watch, but it was the culmination of almost every idea, theme and story the past five seasons had set in motion. It braided together everything that makes "Breaking Bad" phenomenal and was nearly toxic in its crystalline purity. It was majestic, cathartic, harrowing and great. This is the best ever TV show in the history, which I think. This Sunday will be last episode but I want to watch more episodes. Please don't get end. I hope this kind of serial would come in market in future. Walter White is the best ever actor. What an acting is done by him. I become a fan of Walter Whiter (Bryan Cranston) Jesse Pinkman is also the best actor. All character played their role seriously and let this show at the top of the list and it is therefore list in the world genius 2014 book. I started to watch it on 2013. I bought season 1 and I was unable to stop my self and in a week I completed 2 seasons and then at the start of the September I meet closer to aMc. I don't want to wait more for the last episode. Sunday please come closer :). At the last I would like to add is that, I will miss breaking bad <3 In an age where nerds and geeks might seem empowered by the likes of 'Community' or 'The Big Bang Theory', true geeks and nerds know that Walter White is the true avatar of geek apotheosis.<br/><br/>We have watched Walt slowly metamorphose into his demonically cool alter ego Heisenberg with more shock and awe than we did Jeff Goldblum's Brundle become the fly. So this is a modern American Macbeth, subtly scifi flavoured and as addictive as the crystal meth White so skilfully cooks.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Walt doesn't just kill and plot to further his "Empire" - he wants to avoid DEA brother-in-law Hank from ever discovering his activities while seemingly caring that Hank is protected and genuinely affected when Hank is attacked and then threatened.<br/><br/>He may be caught, or go on the run but the greatest conflict, the outcome of which may never be known, is the spiritual battle within Walt. Does the Tyrant Heisenberg eventually wrest control of his soul, or the martyr for his family, Mr White, win? Thanks to netflix and vudu, I've just spent the last three weeks getting up to speed on all currently available mind-blowing episodes of what has to be the most lethally addictive, stunningly compelling, brilliantly written and performed non-major-network television series in the history of the medium.<br/><br/>With Breaking Bad, Vince Gilligan and Co. demonstrate what television actually can be; to say it's ground-breaking entertainment is a deplorable understatement. Each and every episode of the fifty four that have been released thus far - with the last eight to start filming next month and set to air in the summer of 2013 - have left me wanting more, craving more, like an addict. One night I watched six at one time, should've been heading to bed after the third but instead I found myself hitting 'play next episode' until I'd finished the last one of that season.<br/><br/>It's all been said already, of course - the staggeringly genius performance of Cranston as Walter White and his slow, magnificently staged transformation into Heisenberg (at this point I call him WaltHeisen), the also magnificent performances from everyone else in the cast, the sheer dazzlingness of the writing, the direction, the photography. . .Everything about the show is perfection incarnate. I especially love how they don't start the episodes off with 'Previously on Breaking Bad. . .' but rather they use the far more effective method of an opening scene, followed by the Breaking Bad music and title sequence. <br/><br/>Sometimes the scene (particularly in the earlier episodes, from season one) picks up right where the last one left off but most often, it's a teaser scene, which ties in with something later in the episode or in a different one altogether, like with season five starting off with WaltHeisen 'celebrating' his fifty second birthday in the diner, but eight episodes later, in the half-season cliff-hanger (with the cleverly-titled Walt Whitman poetry line Gliding Over All), WaltHeisen is still fifty one. The ultimate teaser, morbid shades of things to come. Absolutely cannot freakin' wait - another deplorable understatement. I wasn't sure it was ever gonna happen (and especially not so quickly)but i think i've found a show that challenges Dexter.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad is pure and simply engrossing television, that actually improves as the story evolves and the seasons pile up.What really does it for me is the emotions which this show evokes in me. One minute i'm rooting for someone, the next minute i want them dead!! It feels like a sporting event at times. Never have i had this sustained response to a show.I do actually prefer watching the aforementioned Dexter, but for uniqueness this is just pure head and shoulders..Maybe tonight is the night? Maybe it would be easier if we just, cook.. You are lucky if you haven't seen Breaking Bad because what a treat you have in store!!! The acting is exceptional, the characters are intriguing to say the least, the story line is believable, and every single episode will leave you wanting to see more and more! I am a very picky viewer when it comes to movies and television shows and I hardly ever find myself addicted to a television show so I feel like if I love it then chances are pretty high that you will love it too! So go to Netflix or ITunes or Amazon, or wherever you go to watch television and sit back and enjoy one of the best shows you'll ever ever see! I really am envious of people who have yet to see Breaking Bad as silly as that sounds! But even though I have seen every episode I still am able to very much enjoy re-watching all six seasons. Enjoy!!! Cinema quality sophisticated thriller with a twist... a deep character examination. Walter White is a fascinating character dealing with constant internal conflict. I do admit that this show is NOT for everyone. It is harsh, violent, but 20% of the time it is LOL funny (in a dark sort of way) too. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul...both amazing performances and are the superstars that make the show well worth watching. Jonathon Banks, Giancarlo Espinoza and Bob Odenkirk are the best supporting actors...maybe of all time. The writing is barely ever predictable. Amazing that for 5 seasons in a row...each episode actually improves. So...over the years...this show has reached uncharted territory for television.<br/><br/>My favorite episodes? 'Full Measures', 'Half Measures' 'Dead Freight', 'Ozmandias', 'Felinas', 'Seven Thirty Seven' and 'The Fly'. Too many more to mention, but those are noteworthy to say the least.episodes included some of the best work that I have seen on ANY screen. Vince Gilligan and his writing staff will take you on a roller coaster ride. Finally...it was something to look forward to on TV. I hope reality TV is finished because of this show. You buy the DVD set and you get 62+ hours of entertainment on just about the same level of 'Goodfellas' or 'Pulp Fiction' or 'Scarface'. I love Sunday nights and I love how I am on the edge of my seat...almost feel like I have to tell myself it is NOT real...it is a TV show. Latest season intrigued me as it deals with high tech crime. This show will blow your mind. It is so much fun and I am so thankful a good friend told me to check it out. The one TV show that will make you say "Oh my God, that's amazing!" So off-the-hook awesome! I was addicted the first episode. 10 OUT OF 10! It makes you fascinated in criminology and makes you want to scream when something horrible happens. You'll be pleased and be paying attention the whole time. <br/><br/>It makes you think though... the fact that there are actual people out there like that. It makes your blood curdle in a good way. That way where you just want to watch and read everything interesting there is to watch and read. I don't recommend for children though for many reasons...<br/><br/>..To many adult references. <br/><br/>But other that that, ha, WOW. So good. Watch it! Watch it now! :D Wow. A thousand times wow. <br/><br/>Now in it's fifth season, Breaking Bad is one of the most unique and stylish shows to appear on television for some time. So crammed full of high octane drama and thrilling story lines, you can often forget this show is made for TV. Bryan Cranston, of Malcom In The Middle fame, is so immersed into the character of 'Walter Wight', a chemist professor who 'breaks bad' after suffering a cancer scare, that it almost seems as though two very different actors played both parts! And I mustn't forget such a stellar supporting cast. These characters are incredibly interesting, multi layered works of art and fit the writing like your favourite sweater. <br/><br/>Over five seasons we see a huge transformation in Walter, from a man desperate to do whatever he can to support his family in his time of need, to one with delusions of grandeur, frighteningly encompassing this new lifestyle with an almost sociopathic rationality. We see changes in those close to him. Hank's dealing with being shot and losing the ability to walk unaided and Skyler's acceptance of Walt and her descent into chaos are of particular note. Aaron paul's portrayal of Jesse Pinkman, a former junkie turned cook is another highlight and further reinforces how brilliant writing can complement superb character development. <br/><br/>Everything about this show is stellar. The funny moments are dry, clever and better delivered than most comedies. The depth of drama in this show is apparently endless with nearly everybody on a knife-edge of some sort. but it is the action and cinematography where the show really explodes. This is where the show transforms from a great television show to a stylish, unique piece of modern art. Much like the early Tarantino films, the cinematography and overall style is so distinctive that you could spot a breaking bad scene a mile away. It is often breathtaking and as always full of beautiful surprises. <br/><br/>This truly is a must see television masterpiece and is a work of the highest possible quality. <br/><br/>The easiest 10/10 I have given so far. To all you independent filmmakers out there:<br/><br/>Take a look how this show is filmed. It is so simple yet gripping. There are no moving camera shots for the most part and the camera is always on a steady cam. No dollies involved and they use simple angles and very few close ups. <br/><br/>Shows like this inspire me to thinking that I can actually make something similar. As far as the writing, it is top notch and very layered. The writers pay off all their plot devices and set up them equally as good. I also like how they dwell on certain scenes for 4-5 minutes at a time. It creates a certain realism that emulates real life. As far as the content, it is captivating in a sick way, similar to Pulp Fiction and other black crime comedies. <br/><br/>My favorite part about this show is Aaron Paul and his madness. The show truly captures the up and down spiral of dealing drugs or doing them. There will always be downfalls and people going to jail or dying around you. One minute you have thousands, then the next you're left broke and have nothing. Some of the best moments are when Walter and AP are frantically disposing or moving drug money/paraphernalia. I love how they always hide sixty grand under the kitchen sink or in their vents. <br/><br/>A must see and definitely one of the best shows of the last decade. Some of the idiots who are rating Breaking Bad poorly and knocking it for stereotyping and poorly developed characters are just that..idiots. It is TV!!!! Of course most of it would probably NOT happen as it does on the show but when you are condensing LIFE into a 1 hour segment for television, it often WILL seem stereotypical! Yes, the lead character and his partner escape death too many times to believe and yes, some of the BAD guys seem to far-fetched(the 2 Mexican Hit-man) to believe but the show WORKS on so many levels if you approach it with a open mind and are WILLING to suspend some truths. I love the show and think that other than a couple of "writer's liberties" the show is dead on and very very entertaining! If you need absolute truth(all you who knock the show) go read some Dali lama books!! I've seen many television shows, and almost of every worth while movie ever produced. In my opinion this is on of my top five favorite in either category. The story is captivating and will grip your attention throughout every minute(you won't be getting up for a drink). My favorite aspect of the series would have to be the acting witch is incredible. Bryan Cranston is phenomenal, and portrays his character to the letter. With the perfect combination of action, drama, and material thats makes you think this is by far one of the best television series to ever hit the air waves joining the likes of "The Sopranos" "OZ" "The Wire" and in my opinion "Dexter" witch is another superb series. What I find most incredible about it is they are able to create such a fantastic experience on cable T.V. without the freedoms of HBO and SHOWTIME. GREATTTTTT SHOW. WATCH IT!!!!!! The incompetent schedulers of British TV have put this great show on at midnight. What is their problem? It deserves a wider audience. It is so well produced: the look is perfect; the location shooting vivid; the interiors full of atmosphere; the twists really unexpected; and the characters intriguing. The plotting is an ingenious mixture of personal psychology, family tensions and social comment. It knows how to keep viewers wanting more and to tune in next time. (Spoiler Ahead) Each week there is at least one stunning sequence: in Season 2 episode 7 there is a classic few minutes, which should be part of the curriculum of every film school, where the informant's head perched on top of a tortoise moves along a ridge and explodes with devastating effects on the DEA agents who've come to investigate. I don't like the show. I think the premise is original and promising. I also think Brian Cranston is well cast in the lead, which is reminiscent of the role made famous by Michael Douglas in Falling Down. However, everything else seems to fall flat. They are trying to create a dark dramatic series in the mold of the Sopranos, the Shield, or Rescue Me, but this show just does not pull me in despite my giving it chance after chance. For the three aforementioned shows, I was hooked after the very first episode I watched of each, but after weeks of watching Breaking Bad, I am still indifferent with regard to the show.<br/><br/>As to what specifically I think the problem is, I am not sure. Outside of the lead, I don't care for any of the characters, so we can start with no meaningful character development for the supporting cast. The bald friend/neighbor is annoying to me whenever he is on screen. That actor seems miscast in this show. He is cast as a macho, bumbling,and not terribly bright or insightful and I have the paralyzing suspicion that he is supposed to provide some sort of comic relief, which does not come through. He looks like he should be playing a role more in the mold of Vic Mackey from the Shield. I haven't cared for some of the story lines, and some of the stuff was just flat out unbelievable. An example was when Walt's hostage escaped and the situation resolved itself by the running into a tree and knocking himself out. I have never seen or heard of someone knocking himself/herself out cold by running into a tree like that. It was a cop-out way to resolve a very sticky situation for the main character and IMO an indication of sub-par effort from the writers. It will be a shame if this show fails, because the premise is original and promising. Midway through season 5, and I cannot understand the hype..... Mostly BORING. I have never seen a television show start out with such promise in its first season and then degrade so precipitously in its second.<br/><br/>The first season (10+) of this show is a truly original achievement, blending the masterful creation of suspension of disbelief for a highly improbable premise, the darkest humor, high irony, excellent writing and character development, brilliant acting, and bone-chilling suspense together to create a masterpiece. I could not stop watching it and was reminded mostly of the best Hitchcock while sitting their jaw-dropped and reeling, completely addictive and brilliant television.<br/><br/>The second season (4, being charitable) of the show crosses the line into absurd elements that prevent suspension of disbelief, pares out the black humor by at least 80%, contains only very obvious "Dickensian" level ironic elements, devolves into a formulaic "hyper-dialogued" progression from "soap drama moment" to "soap drama moment," stops all meaningful character development cold, hampers the actors (who for the most part are very obviously phoning in their trite, yawn inducing lines... but still manage to do a good job), introduces banal and unnecessarily derivative subplots seemingly geared to a teenage/young female vampire melodrama audience (office dalliance, ill-fated romance, etc.), removes all of the nail-biting suspense and replaces it with "are we there yet?" mild annoyance, in short castrates the show and drains all the testosterone right the hell out of it... quite a feat.<br/><br/>Does the marketing machine insist on feminizing every single good fictional show appealing to a heterosexual male audience these days? Why yes it does. Apparently men don't watch much fictional television these days and no one cares if we do because we aren't that susceptible to advertising and branding (unless it's pickup trucks, beer or golf equipment).<br/><br/>The progression from "Breaking Bad" Season 1 to Season 2 is as if one's favorite season of "24" was followed by a season in which Jack Bauer goes around and ties up all his past romantic interests ala "chick flick" methodology, wholly derivative and destructive of the show's premise and potential.<br/><br/>Caveat, I have not seen Season 3, and have no real incentive to unless extreme changes and reversions to Season 1 form are made.<br/><br/>Caveat 2, beware of marketing shill reviews on IMDb, there's obviously quite a bit of viral marketing at play on this title. Any awards this show wins or has won are attributable to the brilliant first season, not the second. I have nothing else to watch so I finally decided to watch the final season of Breaking Bad. I couldn't stand listening to the tedious dialogue between the characters in the earlier shows so I hoped that at least the last season would be better. I was wrong!! The finale has got to be the worst season of all. I am still in awe why anyone finds the show entertaining. First the entire plot is stupid and then if he's dying, why does he need to kill Mike in 5th season? He's got boatloads of $ so take some and go away on a long trip, and please just DIE. I've been fast forwarding through most of the shows. I think I'm going to skip the rest of the shows, go to the last one so I can see WW die. The Finale of this series has been almost 2 years ago. Still today are people writing reviews about this show. They still love it, they can't let go. Just like me. Wish I could experience it all over again... and again. Better Call Saul has got a slow start. Some characters from BB appear in sidelines. But I'm afraid that the expectations are very high. Better call Saul is not about BB. It's a totally different series. Of course people are watching and hoping to get that BB high back. BB is like the love that broke your heart. You will always remember how good the feeling was, but you will never experience it again.<br/><br/>BB is a hero story. A 50 year old man facing total defeat, transforms himself into a winner. That in itself, brings a message of hope to a lot of people. The possibility of turning your life completely around, and doing what needs to be done. Totally transcending morality and mortality. The way this story captures your mind and soul, is beyond any other TV series.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad is the best TV series ever. Hands down.<br/><br/>edit---------------<br/><br/>Wrote the above today, just found out that season 6 is coming!!! I am stunned! Just clicked the spoiler alert for the lines below.<br/><br/>Walt didn't die! Season six begins with Walt waking up in the hospital, handcuffed to his bed. He's going to trial and will be incarcerated. He will be a high profile prisoner but not for long, I guess... He will use his chemists skills to breakout and start a killing spree, likes there's no tomorrow. The blue meth business will be revived and he once again will be the king of meth. I don't hope that he is still so family oriented. Why not surround himself with good looking golddiggers?! Be a real criminal kingpin! The shooting starts in July 2015 and I hope the premiere date will be in January. I Hope. The show is nice but it is not 10/10 as people make it..7/10 is more reasonable Part of the reason I watched BrBa was the famous and mysterious ending of the movie. So I gave it a try.
I liked the meth part, the family issues were exaggerated, the bad guys did their part good enough.
After season 2, I felt awfully bored and I left it hanging for months and watched other shows instead. 2 of my friends insisted on watching how it ends so I started once again from season 3. Season 2 and 3 were just awful excluding meth making part.
I was just clicking every new episode and waiting for the famous ending. I was legit Bored out throughout episodes.
Come to the ending and it was literally just a plain ending. Nothing special or famous or even at all. Just that.
The only reason I give 6 is because I liked the concept of a guy just wanted to help his family. And he died while doing it. Other than that , 5.5 out of 10 is what actually I give. I was obsessed in the start but in the last seasons I was hoping for Walter to die. I was fed up with him destroying lifes around him constantly, it was predictable that he would choose himself over others after a point. Breaking Bad has changed the face of television. <br/><br/>This television show is truly amazing. There is no other television show that has so many strong elements than Breaking Bad does. It throws the viewer into a world of violence, drugs, sex, explosions and Meth labs. <br/><br/>The acting in this show is simply astonishing, it is one of the many strong elements. Bryan Cranston is simply amazing in these five seasons, he takes the audience on the journey of Walter White, a character which for any actor would be an extreme challenge however for Cranston he seems to take this protagonist (turned antagonist) lightly on his shoulders and show us the story that turns this chemistry teacher into the legend that is Heisenberg.<br/><br/>Aaron Paul plays Jesse Pinkman as a character which we think is going to be the light comedy character within the season however as he develops more and more into a darker character we can tell that this is definitely not the case. Jesse turns into a character that we want to have a good life, he is the character that we reason with, we see his faults and we seem to get closer and closer to him as the seasons go on. Aaron Paul starts off as a good actor and turns into a stunning actor by the end of the fifth season, Jesse Pinkman really does turn into a character which may start off as one many actors could take on, however at the end it is simply only Aaron that I can picture taking on this now complex character. <br/><br/>These two actors are two of many who have donated their amazing acting skills to this television series and made it the revolutionary piece of art it is today. Anna Gunn as Skyler White, Giancarlo Esposito as Gustabo Fring, Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman (who will return in better call Saul) and Dean Norris as Hank Schrader all added a hell of a lot to the series and all have memorable characters who are different from any we have seen before.<br/><br/>Michelle MacLaren directs eleven of the breaking bad episodes beautifully, she also excecutively produces thirteen of them. She has directed the most breaking bad episodes and following behind her is another great director who has contributed some excellent work to the series, Adam Bernstein, he has directed eight episodes. <br/><br/>Vince Gilligan is of course the genius behind these characters and the storyline that follows them. He created the series and wrote sixty two of the episodes and even directed five episodes himself. After the reaction of breaking bad he must be one of the best writers of the 21st century, it is simply staggering the mind he has got to create some of the ideas in this season.<br/><br/>These people and many others, make Walter White's transformation into Heisenberg, an amazing award winning, controversial five seasons which defy television and has changed the way that directors, actors, writers and producers are going to approach making a TV Series. I recommend this series to all of my friends and will continue to. I really hope it makes a return after Better Call Saul. (As apparently there is a little more the the ending than we expect). Awesome show! what I really like about it is that it really hooks you at the very beginning unlike some other shows that are also good. Like the Sopranos and the Wire for example. I got through the Wire and thought it was very good, but it took a few episodes to get into. <br/><br/>The Sopranos I didn't really get into after 2 episodes and decided not to watch it. This, though, hooked me with the very first few scenes. <br/><br/>The acting is superb and the story is wonderfully written. I also love the way the season 2 ended in that it could basically be an ending for the series if only two episodes were going to be there, but it also acts as a good link to more seasons (I think season 3 has already been announced). <br/><br/>Great Show! Everyone should watch this, except people who can't stand to see the darker sides of life. For those of you that love this show please stop reading, my opinion is just that an opinion<br/><br/>This is literally the worst show I have ever seen in my entire life, and I finished it, every episode. The idea is very cool. Chemistry teacher dying of cancer decides to become a kingpin to provide for his family because he has nothing to lose.
Something I will say is that Bryan Cranston was phenomenal, his acting and not so subtle shift in character was impressive<br/><br/>Now that we've covered everything I like about the show lets talk about what I hate:<br/><br/>Cinematography: Is done so poorly that I actually got a headache and nausea from watching, If you'll pay attention to the bottom of the screen you'll notice its moving<br/><br/>"The Breaking Bad Test": I created a new way to judge shows what I do is Whenever the show starts going I start counting and if nothing of interest is happening and there is no dialog and I can reach 60 before either of those things happen it fails. This is one of the worst things about the show, there is too much downtime between actual scenes, like a 2 minute scene of the main character standing in line or a 1.5 min video of him washing his hands before dinner, a 4 minute scene of the two hitmen walking down a road and so on.<br/><br/>Nothing to look at:
Imagine one of the best movies about drug dealers ever
Lets use Scarface
You've got the sexy women and the muscular men
The big guns and the action scenes
You've got the mansion with the tiger and cars
The interesting and complicated characters
Now take all that away and you've got breaking bad, Gross old women, very few action scenes, No flash or panache, and mostly boring 2 dimensional characters with back stories and dialogue like they were written by a bored 13 year old<br/><br/>One of the most redundant plots ever conceived by man:
I'm going to spoil the entire plot for you
Walter gets up fights with his wife, goes and makes meth which we don't see most of the time, fights with his tweeter friend, has a problem with his meth business, goes home fights with the wife 3 episodes later solves the one problem with the business...and repeat<br/><br/>The machine gun that WW used to kill himself was my favorite character,
Let me save you about 100+ hours of your life
Happily they all die at the end
Your Welcome I honestly don't understand how this show appeales to so many people. It's INSANE to think that this title has 9,5 on imdb. The caracters are sooo boring and rude, i hate them. I hate this show. Period. I started to see this show in 2020, yes I know it's too late to see this masterpiece, but let me explain it for those who has not seen this yet. The show is absolutely boring in 1st and 2nd season, but as you enter the 3rd season the atmosphere is sticked to your mind and in my opinion the 4th and 5th seasons are the best. The progress you see in Walter's personality is awesome. You have definitely to watch this show. As I said, the negative part is only about the slow pace in the earliest seasons, other than that, this is an incredible show. It's 2020 so yeah, I'm late.<br/><br/>But guess what, I can safely say that besides some pace awkwardness here and there, mostly in the first two seasons I dare to say...it's way better than Game of Thrones.<br/><br/>There I said it.<br/><br/>Watch it and make your own opinion, I did it and I made it. Highly recommended. There will never be another high school chemistry teacher battling terminal lung cancer, while being engaged in a daily turmoil of feeling beat down, crestfallen, thinking of ways to leave behind enough for his family's secured future. There'll never be another chip of the old block kid, looking at making big bucks and partying till he drops. There'll never be another badass brother in law seeking every measure to keep his city's streets clean of meth heads and chefs, in turn leaving his legacy behind. There'll never be another overly cautious and meticulous man, steadily building an empire, purely based on exacting vengeance against the people who took his only semblance of family from him. There'll never be another two bit bus bench lawyer, hell-bent on capitalising on others misery and there'll never be another no non sense guardian angel disguised as an a******. Worst of all: there'll never be another Heisenberg!! Kudos to Vince Gilligan and his team of superfluous writers to have conceived this epic masterpiece that will never let anything else even come close enough!! HATS OFF, HANDS DOWN, THE BEST SHOW EVER!! I love the show but the wife is ruining it for me. Everytime she speaks I get angry. She's awful. Shakespearean levels of writing allow for this show to be as good as it is. A protogonist so cruel yet u still root for him, an episode as good as Ozymandias doesn't just happen it is and always will be the result of breaking bad being the greatest ever show. Still think the Sopranos is better? How many shows have an episode with a 10/10 rating? -1: breaking bad. How many shows hold a Guinness world record for their acclaim ? 1: breaking bad. How many shows scored a 99/100 on metacritic. I'll give u a hint not the sopranos Breaking Bad will hold a special place in my heart, it's a roller coaster ride of emotions, drama, suspense and brilliant writing. The best ending possible for a show! An amainzimg drama series, one of the best tv shows that I ever seen. the only series that I liked more than her is The Wire. Indeed the Breaking bad is the best series ever
All the seasons were great as well as each other An absolute classic
You need this in your bucket watch. Great plot and acting.
You will binge watch for sure Just Like the Headline Says It's The Best Show Ever Made. Bryan Cranston And Aaron Paul Are Fantastic In Their Respective Roles With A lot Of Brilliant Characters Like Saul If You Haven't Watched It Yet Why?? You are missing Out On a True Work It Art. Unbelievable good. A must watch for everyone. It literally changed my life.. Can't believe I'm just watching this. One of the best TV shows ever if not the best. At that time I saw 90 series, but Breaking Bad is the best of the best I've ever seen. Never wrote a comment before, but starting to watch again for the second time, brilliant acting, brilliant writing, for the people who have never seen it I would totally recommend, but, don't get trapped into binge watching otherwise you'll never get to work the next day. A must watch. Like above I said it is surely the best ever. It's a once in a lifetime experience. Not much nudity like Game of Thrones but still better. It's been a long time since this show aired but it still is better than most shows nowadays. It goes uphill, unlike GoT that went downhill lmaooo After almost 10 years since first watching it, this is still the best show I have ever seen. I have yet to watch a show that gets better with every season and ends perfectly. This is a must watch show. I watched so many tv shows but this is the best by far everyone must watch it as soon as possible. I liked it so much that I watched it several times and did not get bored. Everything is perfectly thought. I was very late to the game on watching this series. However, over this past month I did a full marathon from S1 ep 1 through the final episode of S5. Wow! What a great series! From storyline, casting, acting, directing, post production this was so well done. If you haven't watched this series, you're missing out. It's TV at its best. Breaking bad<br/><br/>the title of my series is Breaking Bad . The genre of this series is drama , investigation or even thriller.Breaking bad come from USA,The language is inglish.there are five seasons and sixty two épisodes.It's the story of Walter White, a chemistry teacher at a high school, he has incurable lung cancer.To raise a lot of money to shelter his family, he decides to manufacture and sell crystal meth,
He offers Jesse, a former student read to team up.<br/><br/>My note for this series is ten out of ten. This is the best show ever created If someday I have children and grandchildren I will force them to see this show. What's amazing about these series is that EVERY single character was in the wrong and in the right. Every single of the main 10 or however characters choices dictated the ending. No right or wrong. This show is so awesome I would erase my memory to watch it again It is the best and greatest Tv series ever created. It inspires me a lot.
An extraordinary series ❤ From start to finish it is totally gripping. I have rewatched the series 3 times now and it's just as good every time. This is my favorite show of all time not many people watch this show but the people who do give it a 10/10 Stars like me GREAT AWSOME THE BEST SHOW IVE SEEN IN MY LIFE!!!! NO JOKE Just the best tv series i've ever seen in my entire life This show is simply amazing. There is no episode that will leave you bored. Some scenes are boring, but you should remember them. You would be surprised how much they mean to other episodes and to the shows conclusion.<br/><br/>When the show ended, I gave it a big applause. This is how its done! This year, 7 years after the ending of the series, I watched the entire 5 season series, and WOW... What a wild ride Breaking Bad is. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul's acting (as well as the main ensemble of actors on the show) made this show top notch, but the writing took it over the top and made it the platinum standard for all other shows. Breaking Bad is the ONLY show that has ever kept me on the edge of my seat throughout each one of its 80 episodes. Every single episode hits the mark, which I can imagine is very hard to achieve, even for some of the best shows on TV today. So if you've been thinking about starting BB, give it a try. Whether or not drug/crime related TV is your thing, look past the synopsis and you'll not be disappointed. But savor it, because the series is over and once it's gone, you can't get it back! At last I watched all the episodes. And I must announce without any shred of hesitation that this series is the one which knocks! In every filmmaking department, this series excelled. Hats off to the makers. I don't watch much TV series, but I'm glad that I watched it. Long live Heisenberg! I've watched a lot of TV series and i don't love most of them, Breaking bad is not my favourite in terms of mere entertainment, but its a very infringing story and the way it is written its compleatley in another league.<br/><br/>If you're a cinephile you must watch this more than once, I've seen it 3 times and every time i find something new. Best thing I've watched lately. Very interesting story, with a good plot. I especially liked the finale that is incredibly exciting and tense.Also, acting Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul is fantastic. There are a couple of some annoying moments, and that's the only thing I did not like about this series.I would recommend to all fans of the crime genre to watch this series, you certainly will not regret it. Greetings from Serbia! There are shows with excellent writing and acting, but no shows exist that can match the characters & storyline of Breaking Bad. This is a show that does everything right.. something that is very rarely seen in television & cinema in general. Whatever show you are watching and believe to be good, and whatever show you can think of that's currently popular, chances are they fall short in comparison to Breaking Bad. Breaking Bad: A Dissection to Walter White's character Factual Summary Genre: TV Series Title: Breaking Bad, 2008-2013 IMDb Rating: 9.5 / 10 Creator: Vince Gilligan Review centered upon protagonist Walter White (played by Bryan Cranston) Reviewer: Adhikary Rabindra / 2016 November <br/><br/>Dissecting Walter White's Character as Mr. White and Hiesenberg From the start to the finish, Walter White has been central among the characters depicted in the series "Breaking Bad". It takes little—if any—time to get the insinuation that the series must be portraying the stories based somewhere around complicated scientific deductions or chemical formulas when one sees the banner popping out with Mendeleev's Periodic Table mottled in acoustic aura of mystic music. This must have been a perfect motion picture as a tool that Vince Gilligan has devised to show Jekyll and Hyde character of Walter White, an ordinary high school teacher, who later faces the specter of average income family at least one member of which suffers from a fatal disease (stage III lung cancer when diagnosed)—such that the family has to pay the unaffordable merely to expect alleged longevity, coerce-fully—only to become extraordinary, not to mention the psychological turmoil of everyone involved. <br/><br/>As the plot unravels, it is fairly interesting to see how a boring family old-man—that Walter White, of course—turns to a underworld meth chef, a new normal to his cruel and darker side of behavior intermittently alternating to a kind family guy; indeed a caring husband and responsible father to a boy and a baby girl in the course. The weighted yet intriguing relationship of Mr. White, as is addressed by cooking clans of his, with different individuals, which again varying according to the place, context and the surround, adds more spices to the viewers how one's dual personality complicates the social situations. The first time when Mr. White enters into Tuco's rendezvous is when he pronounces his netherworld name "Hiesenberg", being an aspirant chemist and all, coined after Heisenberg's principle, perhaps. The name is then first heard, and echoed, loud and clear inside the meth industries reverberating in the sinusoidal manner to the cartel world, zeroing to customers and blazing to DEA—soon as Heisenberg bombards the Tuco's place with his mystique chemicals masquerading blue methamphetamine crystals, and threatens to reimburse the money of previous 'debacle' trade on top of Jesse Pinkman's—his coworker, injuries, and succeeds. Thus is how Heisenberg establishes his imagery, rather Kafkaesque nightmare for a man like him, unbelievable to whoever have known him, not only near but far and beyond as well. The Jekyll Walter White might be a perfect husband, father and a family friend whereas Hyde Walter White is equally brutal, emotionless individual, who is, at places, called animal even by his meth-cook colleague Jesse Pinkman with whom Mr White shares almost all his business interests. His notoriety could not have reached any farther than poisoning an innocent child with his insidious chemical weapon called ricin to having explicit role in the suicide of trusty business partner Mike Ehrmantraut. Whether his unaffordability to cancer treatment or lung cancer alone knowing that he is surely going to die has caused him to turn into Mr. Tough-Guy-wanted-by-police seems baffling. Or, maybe, he is born that way, only that character precipitates soon after lung carcinoma transcends to his life. He is near perfect in excellently pulling up the rationale for every wrongdoing he commits, sometimes even is busted out for over-reaction—of verbally fabricating unusually intricate details of what happened, how and where. He is best at what he does, as he keeps claiming that—96% and blue color should validate his claim, however; in whole of America, and that's where he reasons that meth-cooking is justifiable at his end rather than to work out a lousy sub-standard product by some lethargic naïve cook, a wastage of precursors, lesser selling price and then lesser benefits at the same time depriving the customers of pure crystal inhalation experience. The later portion includes more of Heisenberg than Walter White, when he gradually and irreversibly implicates himself to a murderer—or so a serial killer even. He is now not only a mere cook, he is the king of Meth Empire after he bombs Gustavo Fring to death or at least that is what he thinks. He keeps on destroying everyone and everyone else in his journey to become millionaire and to escape law enforcement, DEA so to tell, not to mention the destroyed lives of ultimate users of 'blue thing' he manufactures. Day by day he becomes grave criminal in the name of 'providing' for his family, more and more he is pushed further away from uxorial intimacy and family love. Even if he seems to lose trust from Skyler, his wife, he keeps running for money only to save it for her and their children after he will be gone owing to the carcinoma. This has rather happy ending when independently scrutinizing all the felonies that Mr. White has committed. To me, he should have succumbed to more cruel death than is shown, and only in that way the viewers would find more justice in viewing all the way bottom from the start. As a whole the serial is a family drama with interesting mix of crime and violence affecting social virtues of a man and his family garnished with bright colors of joy, love, care, sacrifice and darker shades of victimization, realization and compunction. It also brings about the unpleasant aspect of illegal money, its cohesive and indispensable chain of bummers to the society. it is the best serial i enjoyed from watching this movie, i wish make such as this movie.<br/><br/>By submitting this review you are agreeing to the terms laid out in our Copyright Statement.

HTML or boards mark-up is not supported though paragraph breaks will be inserted if you leave a blank line between paragraph This is the best show I've ever seen and not at all on a subject I thought I'd have a remote interest in. The characters are perfectly flawed, the story telling is smart, the pacing excellent and the wrap-up in the final season is everything you could want. You find that you're breathing heavily as a major story arch is achieved, another wrinkle added to the layers of deception and more intrigue building between various characters (some related, some not) than you thought was possible. The show is such a spectacle, it ends up carrying itself easily and bringing you along for the ride. Better hang on, it's a roller-coaster! Bryan Cranston IS Walter White, aka-Heisenberg. SAY HIS NAME!!! Master Meth Maker Creation<br/><br/>Created and produced by G. Vince Gilligan OBE's going his way - just like the late Spike Milligan. Well, now then lets see where on earth do I begin? Parts of this poetic parable can be gruesomely grim! So let me just say you need to keep an open mind. Don't take those things to heart if they sound so unkind. Think - could you? - should you? or would you dare? It looks as though this character doesn't even care! Cringe's a certainty in this leading series from USA. What do you think you'd of done on such a doomed day? Well, Walt was out to make mounds of money come what may. Keeping the debt collectors and mere money miseries at bay. Stopping poor Skyler from worrying and of course going grey! Everybody loves Breaking Bad because everyone says so. It is easy on the eye when folk can just go with the flow. B.B. is in the Guiness book for being the highest rated show. It is the epitome of writing that's all I think and all I know. Our love for this damned good program seems to grow and grow. I guess you can definitely say that this bloke is Breaking Bad. Why he was willing to throw away all that he as ever had. Walt wants to give a fine financial future for his family. Mr White knows they will turn on his actions angrily. Walter had a job as a chemistry teacher in high school. Also in a car wash called A1 not too particularly cool. That name should get them to the top of anybody's list. Top of the Boss's list was to make Walt miserably pi***d! Now his main aim is Making Meth in the mobile RV. Doing the deed gets done where nobody can see. Only ending in one way I'm sure you'll agree. Would it be a dreadful D - I - V - O - R - C - E? Or more tragically a trip to the Hospitals A&E? So why did this guy turn to a complicated life of corrupt crime? Did he want to live life differently - this time be more sublime? It all starts when a Sir called Walter White finds out he is dying. His treatment costs so much money - now there is no denying. We certainly can't condone - for this gent is only trying. It's unlawful what he's making it really is high flying! "Blue Ice" is so pure the meth heads can't help buying! While the whole time this Master Meth maker's bare faced lying! Causing many people heartache they only end up crying. At times his acts are barbaric and seem totally unfair. Is the reason because the treatment has zapped out all his hair? Though his needs are a must so who can really blame him? It's not like us humans don't divulge in the odd sin. Walter seems to take the news of Cancer in his stride. If you ask me it is a big deal and can be tricky to hide. Walt seems to be enjoying this repulsing roller coaster ride. Guilt is way too much but it's really a small price to pay. All his loving family and friends in Albuquerque he'd betray. Especially his brother in law - Hank who is in the D.E.A. Hank gives Walt insight on how to keep the feds at bay. Helps him keep one step ahead thus avoiding any feds raids. Mr W. is involved in one of the biggest illegal drug trades. Shouldn't think it will bring this mad man many accolades. Fortunately Hank hasn't a clue - not one little idea. At times it's like the end of these shenanigans are near. Walt's decided to cover his identity with just one major word. Came up with the name of a chemist called - Heisenberg. Of course he needed a right hand man with know how and nouse. Jesse Pinkman's who it is he ends up losing his way and a house! Some would say he was a degenerate scumbag or simply a louse. Walter liked his guts and also that he could be as timid as a mouse. Named Captain Cook Jesse knew all ins and outs of the game. So to him it's simply second nature though to us it's quite insane! This pair tettered on the edge of fear never a day that's mundane. Do you think Heisenberg really wanted to cause his family so much pain? I had heard a lot about this series, but somehow I found neither time nor ardor for watching it - several seasons, unknown actors to me, ambivalent topic... But recently, thanks to digital media opportunities, I took and watched all seasons in a succession - and I am glad I did so, as abstracts and flashbacks are not of much help if you have missed something, the contents is often sophisticated and versatile.<br/><br/>Season 1 was ambiguous to me, mostly due to the drug issue and the fact that Bryan Cranston reminded me strongly of Cary Oldman whom I like a lot, but then I found me chuckling in many scenes and I realized that I was watching a good black comedy (well, in later seasons, the number of those moments decreased), I got used to the actors and started to like them (particularly Cranston, RJ Mitte, Giancarlo Esposito), paid attention to skillful cinematography, musical background, crazy composition of events and scenes... Moreover, I noticed that the so-called good guys behaved often in an unpleasant manner, and I tend to forget that running drug business in nasty and lethal. I also obtained additional chemistry knowledge but I can promise I will never use it for criminal purposes :) All in all, it is a very good series, although not on my very top where 24, Sherlock Holmes and several Scandinavian crime series (e.g. Bron/Broen) are placed. Or perhaps I have not used to the creations were de facto criminals are more pleasant and elaborated than decent citizens; but I might change my views as I have begun to watch Dexter... It's already been said many times, but this show is great. Well written, great acting, good story line. However, I find it very predictable, and therefore it doesn't get me as hooked as I was with Lost or Prisonbreak. For example (saw this today), the shoe that gets stuck on the ceiling lamp when Walt is trying to catch a fly. But it also happens with the more important things, it's just not that exciting, but just perfect drama. Also small details are not explained (which is perfectly done in Lost...) . For example the green stuff Walter Junior sees on the fridge, which came from Skylar's face. He sees it, but his thought or reaction about it is never revealed. Will keep watching till the end though (currently in season 3) :-)<br/><br/>It's 2,5 months later now and I have finished the show, and therefore I must edit my review... Wow it really got better in season 4!! Much more exciting, really really loved it till the end! Sorry if I ever made anyone doubt to watch it, with my previous comments, really gotta watch this show! <3 Breaking Bad is easily one of the best dramas of all time for TV. I would even go so far as to say its better than most movie dramas as well. Since the first scene of season 1, you are taken through a ride of Walter White's middle aged crisis, in which he reallies he hasn't achieved anything in life. Which is a perfect reason to start a meth empire. There is no such thing as a 'filler' episode in Breaking Bad, just continuously brilliantly written and acted episodes, in which there is never a dull momment and the tension only goes higher. I have never watched a television show as well thought out and detailed as this, and every character's judgements and actions make perfect sense, and not just added in for more TV time and twists. If you have not witnessed the amazement of Breaking Bad, I urge you to go out and watch all 5 (or is it 6?) seasons. It is so well done, I even got it tattooed on my arm, as a reminder to the sheer brilliance that can be created and why I should start watching more television shows. To begin, I binged watched this show badly from start to end. I got to watch the series finale live and I'm thankful I did. I don't think my mouth dropped has many times watching this show than it did for anything else my whole entire life. Just the drama, crime, and pure awesomeness of the entire show brings a incredible connection with the viewers. For example, I like this show so much that when someone asks me "What's your favorite TV show?", automatically without thinking Breaking Bad pops into my head and out my mouth. This show has brought me to love and appreciate dramas and thrillers. <br/><br/>Not only the plot brought me to adore this show, but the characters and setting has well. Another example, Bryan Cranston aka Walter White (hope you knew that) is in a new movie or show, I suddenly have a interest and attraction for that film. Just the characters emotions and passion in the series is breath-taking. From Anna Gunn to Bob Odenkirk, the appreciation I have towards their hard-work and commitment is unimaginable. The setting is also perfect for the show. I seriously want to visit Albuquerque, New Mexico now. From the car wash to the school, much pleasure comes out in seeing how nicely they fit in with the rest of the show.<br/><br/>This is my first review for IMDb and I'm glad to do on something I love to watch. I am not a critic nor blogger, simply a dedicated fan. Yes, there are some few things I would of liked to go differently, but with television you cannot please everyone. I just want to give a shoutout to Mr.Gilligan for a spectacular job on an amazing piece of work. Thank you for reading my review and thank you Breaking Bad! Hope on seeing that spin-off soon! This a story you wont forget, watch how someone like a normal teacher can changes his life with just one decision. When people tell you the synopsis you don't think, or at less i did think, that it would have such a good plot, because at the time you see the 3 firsts episodes you are not going to be able to stop without being exiting about next episode. So if you are interesting in drugs, family problems, existential problems and all things related with that, then this is gonna be the best series you have ever watch. One of the best things it's maybe the way that Walt deal with everything that happens around him wile he work cooking drugs with jesse and then in the 3 season when skyler Knows what Walter is doing after hi know he has cancer I cant put the excellency of this show in words.I usually don't have time to write a review but this show made me write it.I will only Say there is something called EPIC and then there Is BREAKING BAD. !I have seen game of thrones,dexter,The wire....But when you after watching BB these all seems to be B***S***.VINCE GILLIGAN had given a masterpiece to the TV world.It have superb cast,Amazing Writing and Flawless Direction.I have watched the whole series more than 3 times....I just cant get enough of it.If you want to watch a show that worth your tie just go for it...But be careful if you watch this show you might not like any other show no matter how good is it. I've been a long time fan of the Walking Dead and many Breaking Bad fans challenged me to watch breaking bad and when I finished all 5 seasons, tell them what I preferred. I agreed to this and started season 1. I feel it took me a while to feel enthusiasm for the show but gradually I connected more and more with the characters and learnt what they were about.<br/><br/>There is no doubt that Breaking Bad is one of them shows that you just don't want to stop watching, I found myself up till gone midnight, glued to my screen because it was just so incredible and thrilling. It is definitely one of the cleverest and most astoundingly written TV shows I have ever watched and probably tops most movies in terms of writing and the ability to tie all loose ends. Each season finale was fantastically rounded off with a clever cliffhanger to entice you back for the next season, it has every ingredient essential for the perfect show. The characters depth was fascinating and at times touching, it conveys perfectly a theme a desperation and fear along with the idea of your time running out, what will you do with it? You see incredible development with each character and see their slow but inevitable diminish into a life of crime, death and destruction. <br/><br/>Breaking Bad is undoubtedly one of the best TV shows I have ever seen and probably ever will see, Vince Gilligan's ability to write pure gold is definitely exhibited here. You can barely fault the shows continuity, it is practically spotless. The soundtrack was absolutely fantastic and the choice of Baby Blue by Badfinger for the final episode was absolutely perfect for the story. The cinematography was clever, relevant and at times unusual, but always seemed to work perfectly. The editing was mind blowing, it was imaginative, original and completely appropriate, it keeps you interested and entertained. Each field is covered in exactly the way it should be, and the actors were absolutely perfect. All convincing and powerful as well as emotive, they really draw in the viewer and put you on the edge of your seat. <br/><br/>It may seem like I'm giving endless praises but really, this series is faultless to me. I found myself almost in tears when it ended because I didn't know what to do with myself! I had no questions left to ask but so much to admire. <br/><br/>I completely recommend Breaking Bad to anyone, it is definitely not an understatement when people claim this as a masterpiece, if you haven't seen it yet, you are definitely missing out. I guarantee that this show will stick in your head for weeks on end. <br/><br/>When I was asked which show I enjoyed more, The Walking Dead or this? Of course, I said Breaking Bad. I have just finished Breaking bad and I feel like I've been on a roller coaster. I was recommended by a friend to see it and after a lot of critical acclaim I decided to give it a go, the gamble paid off. Breaking Bad exceeded my expectations and is one the best thing I have watched in a long time. If by any chance you are reading this then I would encourage to watch it as it is one of the best things to come out of Hollywood/studios in nearly ten years. This is a programme that will be remembered in fifty years, yes it's that good. I warn you though that season 4 can be a bit dreary at the start but the rest of the series pays off for this part as well as series 5 which is a masterpiece. It may have finished and the hype may have died down but I urge you to watch it as you will not regret it, trust me.I hope I could have played a small part to you the reader in persuading you to watch this, thank me later Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>What can i say about this show that hasn't been said before. Not much, but here it is. If you haven't seen it yet, do your self a favor and watch, because it's a magnificent series from start to finish. Probably the best accomplished show ever. Not overlong, 5 seasons, in a terrific shape start till end. Everything in this show clicks on highest cylinders, and i mean everything. Acting, writing, directing are brilliant, and what a cinematography - thanks to it you won't feel you are watching a TV show, it's a world itself. Unforgettable characters, villains, deaths, twists (not overwritten!) - it hardly gets better than this. Yes, it has one (just one) weak episode (Fly), of course not by the guilt of creators but just producers and yet they managed to create something out of nothing. <br/><br/>Overall, if you like watching / don't like watching TV shows in general, "Breaking Bad" is an almost universal entrainment which you will never forget. Breaking Bad is without a doubt the greatest show to ever be created. The performances by all actors are amazing, but especially by Cranston and Paul. At the start of the show Cranston is great as the chemistry genius who not only is diagnosed with cancer but has a teenage son and a wife to take care of. This leaves Walt to resort to cooking the worlds greatest crystal meth. This show from the start shows Walter white's transformation from this chemistry teacher, to the most powerful drug dealer in New Mexico, if not more. Paul goes through a transformation of his own through this troubled slacker in his twenties, to a broken man at the end of the show. The writing of the show is amazing, and the creator, Vince Gilligan has made a masterpiece through the basic story line, to the completely detailed moments throughout the show. To keep this short, whether it be the amazing writing or acting, this show has made an impact on many, and will never be forgotten.<br/><br/>Rating: 9.9/10 This is my favourite show by far, it is rivalled by very few other TV series. Some people say it's slow, but that's the pacing of this show. It build up and explodes, and me personally, I like that pace, I don't get bored by it in any way. The writing is excellent, the acting only makes it better and the character development is crazy good. Walter is quite the typical guy but he slowly becomes a different man. Every scene has some kind of impact on the show and it can be subtle too. The camera work is jaw-dropping. I've maybe watched Breaking Bad 4-5 times, every single episode. It's arguably the best TV series of all time and the awards only prove that it's true. As for negatives go, I can't really find any. Breaking Bad has changed the way we viewers judge television , once you watch this you will always end up comparing another TV series to Breaking Bad , always. The genius idea created by Vince Gilligan , a chemistry teacher diagnosed with cancer partners up with a former flunk student to cook crystal meth. Walter White is very much a family man and will do anything to provide for his family , even if that means lying to them all , his wife, cerebral palsy son , sister in - law and brother in - law DEA agent Hank. It is very much so a dangerous road to take for Walt , but it is something he is willing to do. The continuous display of high standard acting from Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul delivers us with an intense atmosphere right through the series , with twists and turns of the relationship between Jesse And Walt , it isn't something you can just take your eyes off . The series - long search for the meth genius 'Heisenberg' is Hank Shraders story in this series , with him only leading to realise n season 5 that it was in fact his brother in - law Walt , was the drug-lord mastermind. A true work of art from everyone involved and i highly rate this show to the highest standard , masterpiece. Without a Doubt I can tell you that Breaking Bad has blew my mind. Wide Open! Truthfully I didn't think much would come out of this show and judging on all the Hype I thought it was massively Overrated. Well I can tell you now that I haven't been more wrong in my life then the day i had that thought in my mind. <br/><br/>Season 1 starts off as you would expect from the greats of Recent T.V history. A Normal guy by the name of Walter White gets stage 3 Lung Cancer just after his 50th birthday and for the future of his family decides to start cooking Blue Meth. As the show gradually progresses we see Walters slow rise into the Drug Business as by the time Season 5 hits Walt has gone from an ordinary guy doing ordinary things to cooking Top of the Range Meth and becoming a major force in the Drug world. The show is breathtaking from start to finish for each season keeping your eyes glued to the screen. Every movement every reaction and every line spoken by not just one but all the actors is of pure perfection something that you would rarely get in the Art of Film and Television these days. More often than not the suspense the show manages to build is fantastic and very cell done. Even with limited action scenes in the Shows life we are still begging for more come the end of each episode.<br/><br/>However the Performances that top the Cherry in Breaking Bad has to be the Wonderful Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul playing Walter White and Jesse Respectively. Both men put in breathtaking effort into there roles something that thy will never be able to overdo regardless of what the future holds in store for the two. The chemistry between them is jaw dropping. Straight from the pilot they click together fantastically well and I feel that the show truly does work best when it's just scenes with Jesse and Walter involved. Fully deserved of their Emmy Wins.<br/><br/>Finally to cut a long story short the Final Season is possibly the best climax I've seen to a TV show. It manages to avoid a controversial ending with many answers left unanswered ( Lost / Sopranos) and instead gives us an ending that we were all desperately hoping for. The Journey of Walter White will be one that will take a very very long time to forget. Vince Gilligan has done a sensational job creating the World that lies in Breaking Bad and for that it will be remembered as one of the greats in TV history. And rightly so..... For any body that hasn't watched Breaking Bad I can tell you that it is a absolute master piece and must be viewed. At the Heart of the story is Walter White(Bryan Cranston) that plays a terminally ill chemistry teacher that cruelly persuades a drug addict Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) to produce crystal meth in order to provide a stable future for his family. But this cruel persuasive side of Walter is a drop in the ocean as he becomes increasingly unstable and applies his wonderful mind to a much darker way of life. Bryan Cranston blew me away when I saw how comfortable he looked in this role. Of course we all know him from Malcom in the Middle and I think that was why it was so unexpected. However, despite Bryan Cranston's fantastic performance I must say the star of the show for me was Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) who displayed incredibly vivid and heartfelt acting throughout the series. From the strongest hate and desperation to the saddest and loneliest emotions that one just lay mesmerised in front of the television. As the first episode begins we are hurled into the craziest of scenes that one cant help their curiosity be captured . Each episode evokes countless reasons to continue watching and your totally at the mercy of small build ups and mini climaxes that I consider to be a genius bit of television. Throughout Walters journey we see him make some terrible and devastating decisions but we somehow understand and almost justify his reasoning . The whole cast play their roles superbly and contribute to the realisation of how mysterious and disconcerting Walters world has become. As the series draws to a close we see all of the characters in a very desperate place and we find ourselves gripped and stuck to our seats once again.<br/><br/>9.5/10<br/><br/>MattRigby It is easier to talk about the things that are wrong with 'Breaking Bad' than those which are right, because it is such an incredibly short list. For the sake of balance, however, a summation of what makes 'Breaking Bad' worthy of the hype here follows: <br/><br/>A unique idea, fantastic writing which leaves very few holes (if any), perfect arc of characters and storyline, and excellent pace throughout every season. The tension of each season reaching a peak higher than the last, then dropping it back down but never quite as low as you were before, superb direction and production value, powerful performances that take you on a compelling emotional roller coaster ride and a sense of intensity that gets you truly caring about what happens to the people involved; the performances are phenomenal and they support the already well judged writing. With every bad event, every loss and pain, you the audience feel the weight of it. A great cast sell the whole thing perfectly, but standout performances throughout from Emmy-winner Bryan Cranston, Emmy-winner Aaron Paul, who really did surprise me as the show moved forward, and "the guy from every American TV show" Dean Norris, who plays the rather annoying but ultimately very good Detective Hank Schrader. The music throughout is perfectly pitched, with a lot of source material driving the drama home perfectly.<br/><br/>It is also a show that gets in, does the job and gets out; it doesn't hang around for superfluous, flawed seasons. It's the show you will miss, rather than wish had ended by now. It is fair to say that upon watching the first season, you may not see what people are so obsessed with; if you reach the end of season three and aren't addicted, you may not be alive. The show develops slowly, exploring the realistic repercussions of the drug world chemistry teacher Walter White and ex-student Jesse Pinkman get themselves involved in.<br/><br/>The bad? A couple of dud episodes throughout the show, and a lack of finality for some characters; would have been nice to have seen more time spent with certain characters toward the end. Ironically for a show that is generally a slow-burner, the finale feels perhaps a little rushed out. Walter White's development is superb, though ultimately he doesn't "bring the rain" quite as heavily as I was hoping/expecting before......well, that would be spoiling the end. <br/><br/>The small quibbles aside, there is no doubt that Vince Gilligan has again created a cultural phenomenon with a TV show. On a geeky side note, keep an eye out for episodes directed by Michelle McLaren, she's a fantastic talent! This show is perfection in every sense of the word. I went on a Netflix splurge of this show (which I believed maximized the enjoyment and addiction. Everything about this series is unbelievably good, and the hype is deserved. Like when older people rave about The Sopranos and its greatness, I am glad to have been apart of a group that enjoyed and will rave about the rise and fall of a high school chemistry teacher. The acting, writing and direction all complement a fantastic drama. It deserves more emmys if possible. Don't wait around watch this show if you are not hooked then you wont get to enjoy probably the best thing to grace television for a long time. Many have or will glop onto other great shows Homeland, Game of Thrones, Dexter, Mad Men, etc, but they all pale in comparison to this incredible success. <br/><br/>Breaking Bad knew what was and never wasted time telling an unforgettable story. Really don't wait to watch this show. Like at the end of Troy when Odysseys says I lived in the time of Achilles, I lived in the time of Walter White. I am speechless... This was like a well written novel, not TV. The tragic story of Walter white was a breathtaking journey filled with loss and sadness at every turn. The more Mr. White took on his alter ego "Heisenberg", the more those he cared about the most suffered. The depth of the story increases with every episode as Walter continues to justify the often brutal decisions he makes as he becomes drunk with power, paying no mind to the obvious effects of those he supposedly cares so much about. Once his DEA agent brother in-law Hank, whose has been tormented by trying to track down "Heisenberg" finds out the truth he becomes so filled with rage, as a viewer you knew he would only wind up like all the rest. In the end Walt gets the only sort of personal redemption that was left for him. When the camera cut away in the final scene with Walter laying in a pool of blood in a meth lab it was the perfect ending to a masterpiece. Kudos Mr. Gilligan for this work of brilliance. I must admit, I was weary about watching this at first but others I trust told me I need to watch it. Since the first episode I am hooked. Having lost my father to Cancer I find it hard to watch this but the emotional roller coaster has been one hell of a ride. This story is raw, gritty and compelling. Acting is expertly done and Bryan Cranston is my true hero. He brought his extensive career and it really shows. I can pick no fault with any aspect of it so I wont even try criticize. If you are reading this because you want to know if its worth watching then stop right here and just watch it. If you are reading this for any other reason then know that I love this title and everything about it. I have watched many English TV series lately, including X-files, Castle, Grimm, Continuum, SUITS. All of these have strong plot, powerful characters and wonderful direction, but they all have something common, at the end of each episode, you got your answers to your questions, murders are solved and cases are successfully closed, so they become a little bit predictable about the end, but these two things do not happen in real life and certainly never in BREAKING BAD.<br/><br/>BREAKING BAD is the closest to real life TV show I have ever seen because you never ever know what is going to happen next. It shows the extent to which parents can go to protect their children, it also shows no matter how much we can justify a crime, it will always remain a crime, yielding bad outcomes, triggering falling of domino which goes out of your control after you let the first domino fall. It gives a pretty good insight into the drug related business, the dangers involved in it, how it can destroy private life and also family of a person. It thus becomes like a warning to all of us from selecting these wrong paths. I can never predict how this series will end, but I am sure that it will be great. Breaking Bad is one of those rare TV shows that actually rewards you for watching it. You really do feel like you are being spoiled by it's makers. It has all of the most well known ingredients that we have come to respect in great entertainment and yet doesn't take any of them for granted. Why can't all TV be this good? Breaking Bad has to be the result of both painstaking dedication and pure talent to craft such engaging TV. You'll realize this when you watch it, guaranteed.<br/><br/>One of the more interesting aspects to Breaking Bad is that each episode will reel you in on its own but the background story has been weaved in amongst them and revealed over several SEASONS. Some pieces were still being added in the 4th series and from my viewpoint, the background of Walter (main character) still has points of interest to be revealed. The season 4 finale left me laughing in amazement at how well though-out and clever this show is. Breaking Bad just refuses to grow tired and unable to surprise, season after season.<br/><br/>Hate me for saying it, but I've watched Mad Men, Weeds, Damages, Big Love, The Sopranos, Deadwood ... all of them promised more than they were able to deliver and left you feeling that it either could have done better or promised a similar experience the following season and didn't. Breaking Bad just refuses to let you down in this way and stays interesting on purpose as if there is no option to do otherwise.<br/><br/>Regrettably, there will come a day when this masterpiece of TV will reach it's ultimate ending, however it's also obvious to me that unlike many many series' I have invested in before, Breaking Bad will be allowed to do so in such a way that leaves us rewarded for staying tuned and grateful it was not exploited beyond it's appropriate expiry date. This is by far an outstanding television show. Amidst a lot of other terrible TV this show stands out. The crux of this show is Walter White is a bored family man and incredibly smart science teacher who gets diagnosed with lung cancer. To pay for his treatment and to leave enough money for his family if he dies he teams up with an ex-student to start making meth. And so begins a web of lies to Walt's family and friends.<br/><br/>This show plays on so many emotions of the viewer. We know that what Walt is doing is wrong yet we sympathise with him because he loves his family and would do basically anything for them.<br/><br/>Bryan Cranston is outstanding as Walt. The thing that I love about this show is that when one episode finishes you just HAVE to watch the next one, and they have little links at the beginning of each episode that all make sense at the end of the season. There are so many little twists thrown in, I absolutely fell head over heels for this show. The characters all have their flaws but given all the circumstances it makes you question what you would do if you were put in that situation. Amazing. ...And to be perfectly honest, I'm not sure the premise is so super duper either.<br/><br/>We are presented with a rather clichÃ©', overly dramatic (soap material?) storyline. A frustrated, middle aged man/chemist/genius/teacher/part-time car washer with cancer, a pregnant wife, and an impaired child decides that with little else to live for he will, at least, make certain that his kid gets to go to college before he dies. He will do this by finally putting his talent to good use cooking Meth. Okeedokee.<br/><br/>The 'jackpot of despair' aside, what is more disappointing is how so many shows utilize the same 'Rucken Figure' facing the abyss motif. It's predictable and perhaps past its effectiveness. It was more purposeful when Bresson and Tarkovsky used it and in its update offered to us by Bela Tarr. I know that every time Walt stares off into the distance with his maudlin masked face I am left to deal with a very palpable awkwardness. This 'awkwardness', permeating the series, can be felt in the writing, the gimmicky camera work (example: a shot where we see Jesse digging a hole in the desert from a physically impossible position beneath the earth's surface), quirky comic effects like music videos and weird advertisements (example:the appearance of Bob Odenkirk in a Mr. Show skit abrasively appearing on Jesse's T.V.). Don't misunderstand me, I applaud experimentation and I loved Mr. Show but in Breaking Bad everything feels forced and slap dash and I'm never really allowed to lose myself in the story.<br/><br/>Clearly, there is a lot going on here so there is just enough time to offer up two dimensional characters with hints of a third. Everyone does well within their narrow parameters but Bryan Cranston seems unable to suggest even the possibility of a hidden persona behind the ever present wounded, self-pitying, ne'er do well.<br/><br/>There is something missing here. Heavy reliance on stylization seems to be a trademark of AMC, I'm thinking Mad Men here, but it's not a replacement for intricate, intimate storytelling and real innovation. This show isn't my personal favourite show but I do think it's the BEST show from the quality of it. I was gripped from the start, I love Walter as a character and the show is probably the best written show I've ever watched and I've seen a lot of shows. The acting and storyline has you at the edge of your seat wanting more.<br/><br/>I love it because Walter does some crazy stuff as an anti-hero but you can't help but to route for him! So much has been written about BB that it's hard to say anything new. So I'll keep it simple...this show is like a train...it starts strong but each episode and each season get better and better, like a train ramping up to maximum speed.
Season 1 is great but compared to where the show goes, well you'll be hooked and amazed. Breaking Bad is the best tv can be. I don't know how to say this. This show is such a masterpiece. I've watched lots of sad movies. I cried, yes. But Breaking Bad hits different. Whenever I remember Walt and Jesse's relationship (as father and son), I can't manage not to LITERALLY cry, seriously, I mean it.<br/><br/>The writing is beyond amazing. I could barely predict what's gonna happen. Even if I could, the way it happened wouldn't be the same as I thought It'd be. Yall did an incredible job!<br/><br/>Plus the acting just- wow! I almost forgot that it was just a movie. The more this story goes on, the better it gets. And that's rare.<br/><br/>To all of you who's reading this, If you haven't watch Breaking Bad- bruh, what have you done with your life? And for those who also loves Breaking Bad... You got high-quality standard, yo. Walter wite is the greatest character ever after him he come jese pinkman ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ I have just downloaded the imdb app simply to review this masterpiece. Most of the tv shows know how to start but very few of them knows how to end. And breaking bad sets an glorious example on what a perfect ending is. The story of Walter white and Jessie Pinkman will never be forgotten, with great episodes that tell's a story in a incredible way This serie can't be described, in other words you have to watch it to understand its greatness.
Dramatically shivering stressful scenes that make your heart rate rise, a dramatic perfecly directed serie that is perfect in all the ways possible you can't,litteraly cannot possibly imagine a better scenario. this series did NOTHING wrong director-wise ; actor-wise ; scenario-wise EVERYTHING!!!<br/><br/>I really admire the drama spirit in the scenario especially in episode 14 season 5. Yes this is a showade in 2008 and made by Vince Gilligan what more do you want me to say The purpose of the establishment of the organization of the father of the series, whose constant action is the purpose of the crime action slang thriller horror, all in one of them, I don't recommend much to under-16s Don't compare it with GOT or any other show... These guys atleast knew how to sign off the greatest show ever. This is my first review on IMDB and it's so addictive that I just watched the entire 62 episodes of breaking bad in 4Days ,well that's an achievement for an outstanding tv series , absolute brilliant ,way too much believable and Vince Gilligan,Peter Gould you beauty ,I mean it's something new and an essence that gives you a lot of pain and pleasure during the entire time of watching process once again thankyou for making this tv series I can't get over of it Without adding spoiler stick with this show as season 2 can be a bit of a Drag, but then it's full on Bi*#!. Well worth every minute of your time. Actually I don't love action movies or series.That's why I was avoiding this series again and again, though I was recommende by many to watch it. After watching this TV series, realised I did the right thing. Do you know why? Because I always make sure that the best deserves the last. I started to watch it because of a peer pressure. In the beginning I was kind of regretting because it was too slow and boring but when the passed it got more and more interesting. The last season is the best season of breaking bad. How genius Walter White was!!! That how a simple school teacher ended up . The ending is really very sad . Honestly Breaking Bad now comes on 3rd rank after GOT and Money Heist . I really wanted to give full rating but because of it's slow ending and some boring episode I had to give 9. Thank you Breaking Bad A series of Breaking Bad legends are boring in some places but the series gets completely different towards the end. Love everything but Skyler really started to irritate me starting from season 4 .. too bad but still great. Do you know what can make life better? Breaking Bad S100.
I wish it never ended
Life goals: Watch Breaking Bad, Checked Last month I watched braking bad.It is drama,action ,and drug war.After watching it I didn't like to watch any other movies for while.It put lots of impact on me and my viewpoint to everything has changed since then.
A calm and knowledgeable chemistry teacher who's illness and not having money for medical treatment expense , also his love for his family has made his personality to change to a monster.Since he allowed himself to makes a lot of drugs ,judge ,and murder.
In 5th season powerful characters show up out of nowhere and get killed by Walt White in an interesting way using chemistrical tricks.
For a couple of reason the movie is attractive.On one hand there are scenes he wants to kill his rivals or anyone like a professional murderer ,on the other hand he get depressed as karma has changed him,he was forced because deep inside he isn't a murderer though.Secondly his love to his student at the end of the movie is unique.
Although I don't like watching movies more than one time but about it I want to watch it again and I wish I could erase my mind .
I recommend it If you haven't watched it,do it. Oh my god i cant explain more about this film. this is so amazing and addicted. there is some content hides in this film about how we live.
aaron paul is so amazing actor and from now i am huge fan of him. all of them acted well.
the ending made me cry.
i really miss this film If you have seen even some of episodes of the show , it's highly unlikely you'll argue with me. W.W(Eisenberg) is the highlight of the show. He is a underdog who overcome s everything thrown at him and yet able to keep you on your toes everytime you see him. Jesse is phenomenal too. I'm a movie watcher! And i shoudl tell you tha in 99% of times director screws the movie with a bad ending.
All the time i was stressed for the ending. By the end, i was happy for the very hood and realistic ending.
It satisfied everyone. The story surrounding around Walter and Pinkman. How they become king of drugs manufacturing, Walter use his knowledge to create different types of drugs.The endings is heartbreaking. The character progression in this series is one of the best I've ever seen. There was some boring episodes in the middle In the all of my life, i cant forget him, he's number one and never come anyone like him, all of us love him so much, i cant live without your poster on my wallpaper at least. Do'nt miss this amazing and wonderfull series at all, just keep it to end............ and what a amazing ending.....
Love u Breaking Bad,love u mr.White, love u Walter White, lovely W.W..... I've never seen a tv series cares about details this much. I enjoyed every single thing about breaking bad. This masterpiece will never be forgotten as long as humans keep talking about great writing, directing, acting..etc. Director Vince and actor Bryan and Aaron was great in their work. Every season is better than the last season. It's the story of a simple become a drug lord A willing suspension of disbelief and reluctant mindset is an absolute requirement to enjoy this drama. It is completely and utterly implausible to believe that anyone similar Walter White could succeed as a meth chemist for even one season without being killed or caught within the 62 episodes the series has. But the tight, virtually seamless story, and the sympathetic relatable characters, who nearly all resonate with most watchers, allow you to willingly set aside any differences with plausibility (which, commonly, the show does not mind doing).
For the most part, all the seasons are very well put together, with each having some of the greatest episodes of any show I've ever seen. Though season 2, as it is, is pretty bad compared to most of the other seasons. Now don't quote me on this because when I say bad I mean Breaking Bad levels of bad, which compared to other TV series is much less of a considerable insult.
Like most shows I recommend not watching this out of order; More then any other series, huge changes in plot, story and character arc take place so excruciatingly fast you are likely to be completely lost if you skip episodes. And the show is the proverbial roller coaster, taking you to the low points and peaks right along with your favorite characters, you won't want to miss a second. So yeah, go check it out. This show is a simply a mixture of All genres. Crime, love , adult, action, romance, thriller, horror etc. Screenplay was just perfect. Its more like a slow poison, the more you watch,the better start liking it.
Heisenberg's character which starts as a simple meth cook to an empire of drug world. walter white and jesse pinkman these two characters doesn't easily goes off the mind once you start knowing them, liking them, getting connected through them.
Special mention to Skyler, marie and hank, they acted competitively to each other & at the end they are the best among them. As a fan of Comedy genres like Friends and Big bang theory, i am not much into this at beginning but once i am into this i started many other like money heist, black mirror, sense8 whatsoever thriller, scifi, drama etc. I always take a high pitch of breath at the end of every episode. This show could be long and kickin.. I wish Jessie start to cook again in a brand new sequel. Saw it, I think I liked it, just a little bit, not too much I got into this show half way through since my husband convined me to start it. We had to go back and watch all the first ones again which he didnt mind. There are a few episodes in the middle that are kinda boring. There's one where the two main guys talk the whole time in the lab and I dont see the pint of that but pretty much the rest is great. You dont get bored and seeing it without commercials on dvd is the way to do it! Why did i finish it so soon??
Just watch it!
Walter's personality changes soo much that at the end, i was scared of him too!
Just watch it. The best tv drama series I have ever seen. Great acting, cast, cinematography,story and anything else you can think of.
Unreal ending.
What else is their to say that hasn't already been said.
Watch breaking bad. Simply brilliant gets better the more you watch it going to be amazing Binge this for 20 days, quality and concept are so great. It changed the tv show world. I will not spoil the series but you must watch it before you die Breaking Bad is a gem everyone should try to get into.<br/><br/>High school chemistry teacher and family man Walter White is diagnosed with terminal cancer and has a short time to figure out how to help pay for his family when gone. After Walt sees his unsuccessful former student, Jesse Pinkman a local drug dealer he reaches out to Jesse to make meth and attempt to help his family's supported living for when he is gone however Walt and Jesse figure out it may cost them gravelly as competitive parties hop into the image. From cartels, drug smuggling, makeshift bombs, kingpins and greed Breaking Bad pushes you on the edge asking for more! A perfectly mixed controversial story for the audience who wants an in-depth, grotesque, fun ride of stunning acting and phenomenal dialogue for most adult audiences to enjoy from beginning to end. Very enjoyable to rewatch and two thumbs up! To be completely honest, back in high school around 8 years ago, my friends kept talking about this character named "Heisenberg" and when we had science class, they kept saying they would produce meth, just like heisenberg. I never understood why, they "looked up" to this character, so I finally asked them what this was all about. They told me, that breaking bad is the best thing they ever watched, and They slowly began to tell me the storyline, and I found it interesting. I kept saying that I would see it, but the day never came until 15th October 2019. The reason why I never saw it at that time, well I don't have a reason, just never came to my mind. But when recently I ran out of series to watch, and I kept thinking that I should give Breaking bad a chance. I'm currently at season 3 episode 5, and I must say that Breaking bad is the Best tv show that I've ever watched. I mean seriously I regret so much I didn't watch it so long ago, but I'm glad I started to do it now. The story line is incredible, the characters is perfect, and the whole script is fantastic. I recommend this to every one who hasn't seen breaking bad, trust me it's worth everything. This is one of the best shows i've watched.
I hope there will be more shows like these. No tv series will be better than this masterpiece. Perfect script, perfect characters, all perfect!!! Spoiler Free Review. :)
I remember watching season 1 and being like; "damn, that's so good. probably going to get ruined if there are 5 seasons."<br/><br/>Now I remember season 1 as one of the worse seasons, not that it is bad, it's breathtaking, but it honestly just gets better.
Walter White is by far the most interesting and fun to watch character ever.
The way he changes in the series is fantastic.
As well as every single character on this show, they are all so well written and holy crap so well acted.
Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul, Anna Gun, Giancarlo Esposito, Dean Norris, Charles Baker, Raymond Cruz, Bob Odenkirk... I want to mention everyone. they are all so, so good.<br/><br/>The story is so simple yet so good, all dots connect somehow. I don't even know how Vince managed to do that.
It gets so crazy that it's hard for me to explain.
Walter, Jesse and Gus are probably my favorite characters on the show.
They are all so fun to watch and so well acted.<br/><br/>If you haven't watched it yet then... you are just missing the best show there will ever be on TV. Not saying anything. Just start with the first episode. A good show
A good show
A good show
A good show
A good show Breaking bad and good girls are by far the best tv series I have ever seen witty and very entertaining ,worth watching This was a masterpiece and such a situation was presented that lead to one bad thing after another. Walter White, the most brilliant man ever who came across such a situation in his life, was never recognized but he came really alive before dying. Cautiousness is a very crucial thing presented in this show and it is in life. Gus Fring was also very intelligent man that only Walter White could conquer, and cartel man like Gus Fring. <br/><br/> Initially Mr. White did it for money for his cancer treatment, but he realized that he never did anything, so he continued cooking meth, for his family. <br/><br/>Jesse Pinkman also a great character that struggled to maintain moral in this whole one after another bad thing, and finally his emotions at the end of the show were like too much to take, like all of everything he experienced throughout. How people dispose bodies like literally disappearing and smoking into acid, this shows the extremity of all bad things.<br/><br/>Overall the show's journey turned out to be very good and it was a true experience to witness the brilliance of Walter White and to experience such a great show. Breaking Bad is one of those rare things that happens such as all the planets of the solar system being in perfect alignment with the sun.<br/><br/>Everything about this show from the writing to the casting is just perfect.<br/><br/>It's the best show by a million miles and i doubt we will see anything as good as it again in this century, If you haven't seen it yet go watch it and if you have seen it go watch it again! It a perfect TV show ................................... Breaking Bad is a thriller, crime, and drama filled television series created by Vince Gilligan that started in 2008 and went until 2013. The main actors of the show are Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul, and Anna Gunn. The show sets place in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Walter White (Bryan Cranston) is a high school chemistry teacher who all of a sudden started feeling sick. Walter's wife, Skyler (Anna Gunn), takes him to the doctors. They find out that Walter has stage 3 terminal lung cancer and is only given roughly two years to live. Walter decides that he wants to have a lot of money saved for his family after he passes. He knows that it will be hard for his wife since they have a teenager with cerebral palsy and another baby on the way. So Walter decides to join the drug business after seeing how much money can be made. He meets up with an ex student named Jesse (Aaron Paul). Jesse was a student that never showed up to class and was a typical bad student, but he knew his information about the drug business. Walter and Jesse start getting their meth business going, knowing that they are risking getting caught and their lives.
 After about a year or two of getting their business on the run, they have to deal with a huge drug cartel that is partially ran by a man named Gustavo Fring. At the same time, Walter White realizes that he can't be going under his own name, so he decides to go by Heisenberg. Walter's brother-in-law, Hank, is a part of the DEA, so he's the most worried about him finding out because he knows that he will tell his wife and he will go to prison. Eventually, Walter's wife, Skyler, finds out that he has all this money stored away and confronts him on how he got the money. He comes clean and tells her the truth, but makes sure that he doesn't tell Hank. Skyler ends up leaving Walter and taking the kids with her and completely ruins Walter's life. He doesn't even want to be a part of this business anymore because of how much it ruined his family. After a lot of talking and fighting, Walter and Skyler work on their marriage and deal with Walter being a part of the drug game. Jesse and Walter eventually get into a huge fight and part ways from each other and do their own parts with the drug business. After realizing that Jesse's life went bad and he was getting robbed constantly, Walter and Jesse join back together and start up their business again.
 Hank and the entire Albuquerque police are looking for the best meth maker around, "Heisenberg". There is some suspension going on because there are pictures all around and Hank notices that Heisenberg looks a lot like Walter. After years of investigating, The police realize that Walter was the one going under the name "Heisenberg" and they start chasing after him. Walter realizes that everyone is searching for him, So he has to completely leave his family and take himself off the map from everyone.
 This is one of the most recommended shows of all time because of how great the story is told and the way the actors make their characters seem so believable. Bryan Cranston is an award-winning actor who is one of the main reasons why this show has been so popular by the way he acts and the way he portrays his character. Vince Gilligan has created one of the greatest shows to ever be made. The plot of this show is unreal because he gets so into depth and wants to have back stories on people so the people watching have a better understanding of the show. On the Internet Movie Database (IMDB), with over a million people rating the show, it has a 9.5 out of 10 which is a very rare thing to happen with that many reviews. This show is a well deserved award winner and will forever be a show to be recommended. Breaking Bad is produced by Vince Gilligan. It's a drama crime show that is very well written and shows all different aspects of a great TV shows; it has the drama, tension, acting and the setting of the show. Gilligan has the setup and the writers of the show do a really good job at grabbing your attention right away from the pilot episode. His writing skills, the camera work and the acting of the characters are only some of the awesome work that has been put into this show.
 The excellent way that Gilligan writes, the way he keeps you on your toes because nothing is predictable he switches setting on what is happening so that you can't really imagine what is going to happen next. If we take a look at how the beginning of the show, it starts with Walter White who is played by Bryan Cranston he is driving around in a RV through the desert in underwear and a gas mask, why or how he got to that point you really don't have an idea. Gilligan includes flashbacks in his storyline which in my opinion are great because they aren't hard to follow when he switches back and forth between memories. For example a different TV show I watched before was 13 reason why which honestly had so many flashback that you got lost and didn't know what was what, if you were seeing a memory or if it was the present time.
The camera work throughout the show is incredible. When Walter is finding out about having cancer and the way the camera zooms in on him blurring out the background, to where the camera focus on the mustard stain the doctor has on his tie when he explained to Walter what he has and what he should expect. Prior to all of these how when Walter is feeling sick and the angles of the camera show him passing out during the job. The angles they use when he is in the ambulance are all great qualities of a well written and directed show. The angles that are given in the first 5 minutes of the show; the motion of the camera when he is driving the RV. How it shakes and it makes you feel like you're inside the car makes everything more believable.
 The acting that the whole cast has put into this show is incredible. The interactions between Jesse who is played by Aaron Paul and Walter is unbelievable. It truly feels like they are the characters in real life not that they are just acting. When Walters family is having breakfast and his son Walter Jr. (RJ Mitte) is sassing back the mom Skyler White (Anna Gunn) about the fake bacon that is made out of turkey not pork the way both characters get so comfortable together and get into the argument and they 100% function like a true family with a rebellious kid. 
 Vince Gilligan drama crime show Breaking Bad is a masterpiece in my opinion the writing, camera work, and the acting and chemistry between the cast are all strong elements that you can't miss skills throughout the show. Overall Breaking Bad is a really good show that really catch your attention right away that you want to sit on your bed and bench watch the whole series. This is the best series if all time. can I say anything else? this is like the Jumanji game, it sucks you inside, the acting and the plot is so natural that you really fell that you are in VR (this actually a great idea, to make this one available on VR devices:)) ) and also perfect dialogues. Breaking Bad shows different aspects of human beings, their darkest spots that they kept well hidden for years until something triggers them out. if you don't watch this, you have just wasted your whole life. Always had me back wanting more. Acting was superb with a smartly written storyline. La mejor serie del mundo, es perfecta. Felina es perfeccion pura The age of Bryan Cranston has returned. Once universally lauded for his work in Malcolm In The Middle, there had yet to be a good vehicle for this man's particular talents. He has that rare gift of generating sympathy and manic-energy at the same time.<br/><br/>For those that would be content to label this show a Weeds knock- off, bear in mind that Breaking Bad is a new kind of monster. It touches on the very same themes, "living realistically as a middle class in the United States" which often makes us resort to extremes to survive. Like the mother and daughter team that robbed that bank. But the weed selling antics of Showtime's hit show is really nothing like "Bad." The Pilot was about as perfect a Pilot as I've ever seen, and much of it rests on Bryan Cranston's shoulders.<br/><br/>Cranston plays Cheimstry teacher Walter White. He has a loving wife, a child with Cerebal Palsy and another is on the way. He also happens to be dying from an inoperable lung cancer situation, which happened although he "never smoked." His finances in disarray, the once great student of science turns to crime to solve his problems.<br/><br/>He cooks Crystal Meth with a good for nothing ex-student. From the antics of the first episode, the show is leading towards a dark place, but a place of truth. This is a no nonsense black comedy.<br/><br/>For people that love Tarantino or the Coen's, this might be your cup of tea. What an awesome change of pace for Bryan Cranston, who is best known for playing the goofy dimwitted Homer Simpson like dad from Malcom In The Middle(2000-2006). But this character is not goofy or dimwitted. Walter White is your everyday man, who is a high school chemistry teacher, and has a loving wife and handicapped son. On the verge of his 50th birthday party. He begins having a mid life crisis, to make matters worse, he is diagnosed with terminal cancer. But not wanting to leave his family with nothing, in a quick way to make a lot of money. He teams up with a former student named Pinkmam(Aaron Paul) who is now a drug dealer, to make the drug called Crystal Meth. You don't like what Walter is doing, but at the same time you try to understand why he is doing it. I like watching the transformation he is going through, like Mr.Chips turning into Michael Douglas from Falling Down(1993). This series is quite enjoyable, it's a good dramatic series, with some humor moments. Cranstons performance in the show is memorable, and at times heartbroken to watch. And he and Aaron Paul play off each other so well. I hope it will last a little while. I watched the last episode nearly a 3 month ago, and after that i watched a LOT of TV Shows, and none of them came even close to the fun, the interest, and the anxiety of what is coming next like the one i felt watching Breaking Bad! Amazing. Fantastic. Wonderful. Dramatic. Intense. Terrific. Tremendous. I can't come up with enough adjectives to describe how great this show is. I didn't even know what it was about when I started watching it. When I read the synopsis a few years ago, already I felt that the storyline lacked interest for me and did not watch any of the series. Then recently some friends were so enthusiastic about the series that I finally got started on it.<br/><br/>So I watched all of episode 1 series 1 and then reflected. Now, it is not as if I am the kind of person who has trouble finding things funny that other people do. But I would say that let's say only half of the material out there that people will find funny will affect me that way. However, this material failed continuously to amuse or excite me in any way except for the suspense of the opening scene not being resolved until late in the episode.<br/><br/>I think of the first episode of a series as the pilot - therefore it sets the level of interest for an entire series. Which meant that after that I simply gave up on the whole series.<br/><br/>So what went wrong? Although jokes are never funny when explained, there exists an anatomy of humour that one can correlate to any given snippet. The general profile of something funny is that it has some element of surprise - it builds up a picture and the moment of laughter is when the viewer or reader is forced suddenly to see things another way. And generally that other way has to have a level of originality for the effect to work.<br/><br/>So I think the problem actually lies in the construction of the screenplay. As much as the ideas appear to be original, they do not unfold in a way that produces the comic effect. Nor therefore is there much occasion of suspense.<br/><br/>So for me the real question is why do so many people find it funny? I think that for me will remain a mystery. Jesse is the worst thing about this show. There was a reason he was to be killed off at the end of the first season and they should have let it go at that. <br/><br/>I would have preferred to see the progression of Walt alone, without his (Jesse) character's stupidity pushing the story line. <br/><br/>To me this is the one flaw in the show. Here you have a character (Walt) who, over time, becomes the epitome of scum and ruthlessness ... and the story line is fully manipulated by the aimless idiocy from the Jesse character. It. just. does. not. wash. I don't care how good the acting is. In any reality, that idiot would be dead. <br/><br/>If it wasn't for the finite nature of the series (ending season 5), I would have left it during season 3 (and i know a lot of people who did). It's just ridiculous that he was left in. Can't believe how much hype there is around this show it's unbelievable!! And let me tell you that i gave it a really good chance! At this moment I'm on the second episode of the last season, but i just CAN NOT CONTINUE. This show is so so SO boring. There's like 2-3 times when something interesting actually happened, but I'm serious it is the most overrated series that i came across- skip this one! First season was great. So, it deserve 8/10 rating. Since Season one only have 7 episode, it was OK.<br/><br/>After that, this show is like Chemotherapy( Poison running through your vain) . This show become radio active after that. I mean, you need super power to keep watching this show till the end of season 5.<br/><br/>It became as boring as possible (like temp of 0 K.)<br/><br/>To be honest I watched it till season 4 episode 3. I watched it on x2 Speed. Even after doing that it seem to be moving as slow as a snail. <br/><br/>And that was it. I can't watch this show anymore or I will have to kill myself for watching this Show.<br/><br/>Lets now , talk about Characters of this show.<br/><br/>Walter White : He seem to be suffering with Bi-Polar disorder. <br/><br/>Skyler White : I am a non- Violent Person. I would have never thought that punching Pregnant women was a good idea. But she changed me. <br/><br/>Jesse Pinkman : I love Feminist watching this show across the world. I don't like this character. But, I will appreciate if some of them get offended or at least get bored by what he is saying. Or I am wrong they already are used to it. <br/><br/>Hank Schrader : Oh, so sweet our own Potato Sherlock.(and yes, I am making fun of both this weight and Deductive skill.)<br/><br/>Marie Schrader : She could steal because she got Psychological condition. Cool, And she got caught. But, I don't care. <br/><br/>Walter White, Jr : I don't think we are allowed to make fun of him. But he is stupid as well. Writers fault not his. <br/><br/>Saul Goodman : What a comedian.. He never forget to remind his high IQ Audience. Who all think that they got PhD in Chemistry after watching Breaking Bad. That it was just... jUst a Joke. <br/><br/>That is all from me. Their is a 95% chance you will disagree with me. But, am I suppose to Care. I heard that this show was so good. I wonder what other people were watching. So far I am just trying to stay awake during the first season. The show moves so slow and I keep hoping that it would pick up. I already can't stand Walt's wife and I would like to kill her off. Jesse is worthless. Walt is doing some stupid things. I don't think I can continue watching this mess of a show. I forced myself to try this out given its "amazing" reviews and it's award for being the "best tv show of all time". I barely even made it through season 1. I couldn't stand the fighting, and how stupid Walt was acting. None of it really made sense, realistically. Maybe it dosent work for me, cause when I watch tv, I can take it personally. When Hank found out that Walt was smoking pot, he could have totally under every situation taken him down to the station. But he didn't! Which is a federal offence since he works for the DEA!!! Like guys! These are simple mistakes! Was SO bored through majority of it. I mean, I'm not a drug addict so maybe that's also why I'm not a fan of this show?? I am kind of addicted to this show even though it is somewhat ridiculous and many of the characters are annoying as heck. But, it is still addictive...like the meth drug itself. I don't really like Walt that much and Jesse is a complete POS. But, I do like Mike very much and Gus is pretty cool most of the time as well. Hank the DEA guy is really annoying and I wish he would get killed off soon. The show has a few really riveting scenes the best being when Hank almost got killed by the 2 cartel guys...oh how i wish this fat dope would go away. I still can't believe Jesse just let the guy cold cock him in the face with no defensive measures whatsoever...come on writers! Anyway, there are many things about this show that are bad, but there are also some pretty cool things as well. There is nothing cool about drug dealing so please don't think there is. The show doesn't show much of the addicted side of the coin, some but not much. Oh, there was one scene when Jesse went to a couple of drug addicts house and to get his stolen money back...another dumb scenario with totally phony drugged out people and a little boy who was cute. That was such a stupid scene. I'll give it a 4 out of 10..my favorite TV show continues to be Californication...oh how I wish it would come back soon. I don't get the hype around this show. It's cleaver, it has some interesting moments and the writing is okay, but I don't understand why it gets such a high rating. Cranston is the same character he played in Malcom in the Middle, a middle aged twitchy, ADHD type with a fuzzy grasp on his values and beliefs. The main character sick and dying starts to produce Meth to build a nest egg for his family. The story deals with the inherent risks to him and his family. I find myself waiting for the cancer to win or at least have some impact on his life apart from coughing up blood and the always at an inconvenient time shortness of breath/strength as it only shows up when the poop hits the fan. A pretty lame gimmick for a show that does at times show promise. Not Weeds, not even close. One of the most boring TV shows i watched , they started it with a bad season and continued to write bad story lines until season 4 it starts to get interesting with a good storyline and in season 5 they went back to do another bad season.<br/><br/>Advice: DON'T WATCH IT I resisted watching this show while it was on air. I hate things that are hyped because they tend to be let downs.I suffered through the first two season and said that was enough of my life I was willing to give to Mr. White and his do-boy Pinkman. I just didn't get what was so sensational about this show revolving around a middle age white guy who decides to make meth. The character development was so weak I didn't care or root for anyone and I didn't understand Walt's desperate desire to leave money for his family who were two-dimensional and whinny. What was extremely annoying was the dragging out of things out over multiple episodes. Case in point, Crazy 8. Did his act really require 3 episodes?? That time could've been better spent trying to establish a legitimate connect. No we have to watch these clowns bumble their way into the drug business, which Pinkman was already firmly entrenched, for darn near nine episodes. Put a fork in me, I'm breaking bad and not giving this overrated show anymore of my time. Breaking Bad is a collection of the most intense , nerve wracking shots ever in cinematic or TV history compiled with some of the most LEGEN...(wait for it)...DARY acting . If you can just endure some boring sections in the first couple of seasons , they are necessary for plot introduction , you will also see some pure gems in regard with cinematography, direction and acting . I think (and most people will agree) that BB's Star-Cast takes this show to a new zenith. I don't think anyone in the acting area can replace Aaron Paul drug addicted , "b**ches" crying Jeese Pinkman or Dean Norris's Hank Schrader or Bob Odenkirk's Saul Goodman, the list goes on. But its Bryan Cranston Heisenberg that ultimately steals the show. His one liners, his monologues , his stares , his anger , everything is pitch perfect. A dying responsibility laden father or a drug kingpin , both roles are delivered by Cranston perfectly and smoothly. You may not love Mr Walter White , but you cannot hate the awesomely cool Heisenberg , you just cannot . And if you go through first couple of seasons , the rest are not just gems , they are pure 1000 carats of diamond . In short , if the painting world has Mona Lisa , the Music world has Beethovan's 9th Symphony , Baseball has Babe Ruth , Basketball has Michael Jordan , Cricket has Sachin Tendulkar , Football has Pele , Hollywood has The Godfather , then the TV definitely has BREAKING BAD . Do not Miss this B**ch , you'll regret it forever. When this show first appeared I liked it very much. However, as time went on I found it less and less attractive because of its violence, which I found excessive. In fact I stopped watching somewhere in the middle of the second season.<br/><br/>I decided to give it another try for the third season. I am again struck by the good quality of the acting, and I enjoy its being set in Albuquerque, I city that I have spent some time in.<br/><br/>HOWEVER. The violence is still excessive. I also find, that with the exception of Walt Jr., there is no character that I find even remotely appealing. Of course, the "law breakers" are uniformly bad and vicious, but so are the law enforcers, with Hank bordering on homicidal. Walt's wife is a singularly unpleasant woman and her sister is no better.<br/><br/>If the program offers any lesson it is that our drug laws produce much more harm than the drugs. I have no idea why people like this show. I cannot find a single redeeming trait, not one. The acting is horrible, the characters unlovable, the story-line crap, the directing idiotic, nothing about this show works for me. I have tried to watch it so many times because so many love this show, but honestly the show gets worse for each try I make. Also tried to jump around a bit and check out the most celebrated episodes a couple of extra times, but nah, nothing. <br/><br/>I seldom hand out a one (1), I save those for the worst crap ever made such as The Flash, so I will give this a 2, but that feels too much. I never believe any hype that claims a TV series is the "best of all time", just because my tastes tend to run differently. I do often enjoy some of these "bests", I just wouldn't rate them as highly. I didn't think "The Sopranos" was the best TV show ever, but I watched the whole thing and I got into it.<br/><br/>And then, there was "Breaking Bad". I just don't see it. Whatever it is that all these other people are seeing, I'm completely missing. I thought the first two episodes had some promise, but it failed to develop. I couldn't get with any of the characters, either to love them or to hate them enough to keep watching to see what happened. I wouldn't say my expectations were too high, because I make up my own mind about things and I wasn't familiar with any of the actors, so I really didn't know what to expect. But wow... there just wasn't anything here for me. I know this is a poular show and i will probably get hate for this but anyway here it is. Walters beard makes me want to be sick. and i don't like his kid either. why is this even a show? there is 0 character development(apart from Jess) and there is almost no plot either like "oh i am bored i will make drugs" wtf. I don't think this is very realistic because I don't think drug dealers would be this angry in real life. Like he is angry about bacon, but ergular drug dealers probably aren't angry about bacon so wtf? I also don't like the brther. i don't know what disease he has but i feel like him not being able to walk is representing something like drugs. I got to know about the show through my friend but it sounded pretty much alright! I mean a professor who cooks meth doesn't sound all that awesome, but once I got through the first season, OMG! it just got me hooked up to it. The casting is excellent and there is justice done to each and every character in this show. The transformation of Walter White to Heseingberg is totally worth a watch. Apart from that the supporting characters of Jesse Pinkman, Skyler, Hank and Saul Goodman are excellently developed. I have got know that a show on Saul Goodman has been released and I just cannot wait to watch that thing after an amazing Breaking Bad experience. It definitely is one of the best TV shows till date! How far will you go for the sake of your family? What will you do for providing your family a better life and better future? If you want your answer this is the show. A father who is a chemistry teacher, and suffering from lung cancer gets involved in the manufacture of meth-the pot, so as to earn money for his family and provider them a better future after he is gone. It is his story how he handles every situation and saves himself till the very end. The role of Jessi Pinkman is the one, which gives the show a cutting edge, how he always creates problem for Mr. Walter White. Hence, all i would say is that it is a must watch show... and those who are in love with chemistry its like icing on the cake...!!! The story of a high school chemistry teacher turned Methamphetamine kingpin is the best show to grace Netflix. Walter White and Jessie Pinkman make the perfect duo with the blend of smart and street smart. Later character Gustavo Fring is professional with every action, down to taking his suit off to vomit the poison given to the Cartel. Saul Goodman is a laugh worthy character and was completely unforgettable with his slow madness decent. The show is absolutely amazing and I will never forget every heart felt moment and yellow hazard suit. The area of New Mexico will never be the same after the infamous drug cook Heisenberg was sadly shot and died in a methamphetamine lab of his design. Jessie's final moments of driving away and laughing made me feel a blend of emotions, sad yet pleased. I remember the night I started watching this work of art. I had noticed it was mentioned on Conan one night and I decided to finally check out the AMC show. Netflix had, at the time, the first three or four seasons on it (yes, I came in late). I watched the first episode and right when I saw those pants fall to the ground, I was amazed. I was able to see the final season live on television and I remember tearing up at the very end of the very last scene of the very last episode. I instantly went online and bought the box set. Breaking Bad has a very original style that includes fantastic directing and writing, beautiful cinematography, the best acting I have ever seen in a television serial, and amazing editing and music. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul are by far two of the greatest actors of the early 2000s. The usage of flashbacks, allusions, foreshadowing, and cliffhangers create the feeling in the viewer to continue watching until the last second. ...then re-watch the show. I have seen every episode three times, at least. I am still noticing new things that connect everything together, making it feel like I am watching the show for the first time again. When Better Call Saul, the show's prequel, had begun airing, I was excited to finally have some more Gilligan-esque episodes. The Breaking Bad world is incredible since it was all written by an amazing team. I could write a ridiculously long review explaining the ins and outs of this series. Telling you all what makes it so good and evaluating each character and each episode with incredible detail, but I'm not going to do that.<br/><br/>What I'm going to do instead, is tell you that I love TV and film. I've watched thousands of different films and I have watched many, many TV series too. So when I say that Breaking Bad is, by an absolute mile, the greatest thing I have ever watched, I want you to take that very seriously. I have spent the past hour or so trying to think of one single flaw, one single bad thing about Breaking Bad and I cannot think of anything. I cannot explain to you how fantastic this series is, in every way imaginable. The acting, the camera-work, the soundtracks, the scripting, the makeup, everything.<br/><br/>I am a hard guy to please in terms of TV and film, and I'm not just saying that, I truly am. I always manage to find at least one negative point in everything, at least one thing where a film or series can improve, but Breaking Bad is as close to perfection as you are ever going to see. If you haven't watched it for whatever reason, I beg you, please watch this series. Ignore all the people who say it is "overrated" or "boring", because they really are clueless, or just looking to cause an argument.<br/><br/>Please, please, please watch Breaking Bad. I cannot put into words how amazing it is. There aren't enough adjectives in the English language to describe it. It is simply, perfect. First up I have to say that I was a late to the party. Series 3 was complete before I decided to sit down to see what all the fuss was about, but in many ways, I'm glad I waited. Two weeks later I was done and could barley wait for the next season. For those of you out there who watched weekly from the beginning, I don't know how you managed to stand the waiting.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad is definitely the most brilliant shows to ever air on television. A critical and commercial success from the get go. Breaking Bad follows a underachieving chemistry teacher, Walter White as he is diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer decides to start cooking Metamfetamin to pay for the cost of his own death, but eventually finds himself in descends into a world of darkness sitting a top the criminal hierarchy as the apex predator of New Mexico's drug community. Is Walt a bad guy then or is he a good guy? Is he an antihero then? Not really, I wouldn't say he was particularly heroic at all. Then what is he? He's possibly the most complex, most human, most inspirational yet most cautionary character that might have ever graces the small screen. Bryan Cranston plays the lead character in his finest roles to date, his ability to transition from Walter White to Heisenberg is fascinating and convincing. I would go as far as to say that this is the best performance i have ever seen in both TV and movies. Even sir Anthony Hopkins agrees and you can't argue with Hannibal Lector. <br/><br/>I've heard people say they're not into Breaking Bad because it's too slow. Breaking Bad is slow because it takes it's time. It takes it's time to establish it's concepts, it's themes and most importantly, it's many supporting characters. But then every now and again, a sudden and unexpected act of extreme violence. Made all the better by how limited it is, how little of it happens. It's not an all-out gore fest, which desensitizes us past caring. Breaking Bad's carnage is fully earned. Death is dealt only when death is necessary. <br/><br/>You can do what you like with a TV show, or any scripted medium for that matter; you can throw millions at the effects, secure the finest actors and visit the most incredible locations, but if the script is sh**it the audience will smell it. That's why Breaking Bad is so phenomenal, despite everything – it's effects, it's performances, it's locations – it's the superior scripting that makes it contender for the top. The writers of the show definitely know what they're doing, using all the supporting characters to the maximum, especially Skyler White (played by Anna Gunn) and Jesse Pinkman (played by Aaron Paul). <br/><br/>As this landmark show came to a bittersweet end, the show as of now remains the greatest drama series of all time. Now, many people consider Game Of Thrones, The Sopranos, The Wire and Mad Men the greatest shows of all time. Granted they're all brilliant shows in their own right. But the cast and crew behind Breaking Bad have not only created waves in television, they have most definitely redefined the genre. Vince Gilligan created such an interesting, engaging and absolutely unpredictable show that you just can't help but be drawn into it's dark and tense atmosphere. This has got to be the best US TV series ever and considering some of its opposition that takes some beating.<br/><br/>The series tells of Chemistry teacher and genius Walter White who finding out he has cancer takes to manufacturing crystal meth so he can leave his wife and children well provided for in the event of his death.<br/><br/>WW soon finds himself immersed in the world of drugs, death and danger.The characterization of the protagonists in this series is nothing short of brilliant and no matter which character gets the chop there's another right behind who you will grow to love,admire, fear or hate, the series can have you laughing one minute, fearful the next or in absolute shock. this is a must see series and I can't find the words to big it up any more than saying MASTERPIECE.... very bad very bad very bad very bad very bad very bad very bad very bad very bad too make TOO GOOD series. When chemistry teacher, Walter White, is diagnosed with Stage III cancer and given only two years to live, he decides he has nothing to lose. He lives with his wife and teenage son, who has cerebral palsy, in New Mexico. Determined to ensure that his family will have a secure future, White embarks on a career of drugs and crime. He proves to be remarkably proficient in this new world as he begins manufacturing and selling meth with one of his former students. The series tracks the impacts of a fatal diagnosis on a regular hard working man and explores how a fatal diagnosis affects his morality and transforms him into a major player of the drug trade. The reader's opinions are spot on. But, all viewers need to accept that 'Breaking Bad' is pure entertainment ... not a morality play or the balance of good over evil. Greed, avarice, and moral voids are part of all human life. That, in itself, is what makes this one of the best (if not the best) of American crime series in the 21st Century. Just as Forbrydelsen (Danish) and The Killing plowed new fields, so is 'Breaking Bad'. Breaking bad - Especially our ongoing 'war on drugs' adds a special cachet to the stories. All future US crime / drug / action / justice - including crime and punishment genres will be judged by this marvelous series. Wonderful ... we will not miss one episode ... and we live in Asia. We love it. Better than 'The Wire,' 'The Shield,' or The Sopranos. We can only hope that they find a way to extend the show for another season. Excellente! i got a bbm from a cousin in USA who was so hooked on the show that she just had to get the word out to all her friends to watch it. I take word of mouth advise seriously so i bought the dvds and OH MY GOD. The show is brilliant, so well written that u wonder what kind of magical brains do the writing. Its funny, the characters are flawed but intelligent, funny but edge-of-the-seat serious. This is a show where there is violence but it also shows the value of a human life like i have never witnessed. This show is a bundle of contradictions that will hook u from the very first episode. I passed the flag my sister passed me and recommended this show on facebook, twitter, bbm and what have you. And its OK if u call in sick because u cant stop watching it till 6 AM. Lots of bad acting (Bryan Cranston is a MUCH better comedic actor than he is a dramatic actor, and the wife just flat stinks), replete with preposterous plot twists and character evolutions ... I didn't buy into this turkey for a second, try as I might (and I tried!). And this show proudly sports the two most heinous "protagonists" in the history of long form drama. I love Tony Soprano! I love Dexter! Walter White and his scummy little sidekick are relentlessly abhorrent from episode 1. I watched the whole thing, god help me. Thanks for NOTHING, zeitgeist! How something this unpleasant and not-well-done could be so popular is... well I guess it's not really that uncommon, is it? But it never ceases to amaze me. (Saul was great, though!) So boring , some characters are unbelievable.rhythm are so slow. I get it. A disrespected teacher with cancer decides to be a drug manufacturer to help his family after he passes. There must be some good in him - who are we to judge? After all his wife works for a tax cheat, his brother in law is abusive to Mexicans, and his son is disrespectful.<br/><br/>Trouble with moral ambiguity is it ultimately excuses all behavior. The people who make this program live in Hollywood so obviously they use drugs, know a lot about drugs, and know others involved in it. After all they're cool and it's a good way to make money by creating a program that helps amoral people feel better about themselves just because they snort a little, or cheat a little.<br/><br/>The question I'd like to ask is whether the makers of this program - the actors, producers, sponsors, and indirectly the viewers would like this program if it meant hit men with guns and axes would stalk their families and kill their family members?<br/><br/>I didn't think so. The moral - don't exploit tragedy just because it's cool, it makes money, and it makes amoral people feel better about themselves. If you're not part of the solution you are part of the problem. This show is highly overrated! It's a good idea. Dull teacher, diagnosed with cancer, wants to leave his family Some money, so he starts cooking meth and becomes a rookie in a criminal world. But the story unfolds so very, very, very slow! There are episodes with no story at all! For example, there is an episode about a fly. A fly in the room where the meth is cooked. And the teacher does anything to get. the fly out, but doesn't succeed. That's the whole story in that episode. Nothing more. And there are many episodes like that. Episodes without a storyline that fits. That's why i can't decide if it is a failed comedy of a failed action series. I only watched it, because my wife liked it very much. It's a soap opera. In the meantime, I did some work and hot it done! So, it has had it's benefits. Best show in TV ever? Master Piece? Yeah, right! Its good, but its NOT THAT GOOD! Read so much about this show, got the whole 5 season to to find the critics were so off! First of all, the script was boring, dull and predictable. Terminally ill chemistry teacher X mid life crisis? A recipe for yawn! As for acting, to be fair, Bryan Cranston is good, better than Liev Schreiber in Ray Donovan, but definitely could not beat James Spader in Black List and Kevin Spacey as FU for the Golden Globe 2013! When I binge on the Black List and Utopia I wished everyday had 48 hours and wish it would never end. With Breaking Bad, after the first season I basically dozed through the second season and then just turning it on while working just for the heck of it. Honestly would have rated this lower than one if possible. Better rated than Walking Dead and Vikings? Yeah okay, I'll kick your son in the ribs. I really liked this show until Season 5. The characters were developed well, the story was interesting with a spot of dark humor here and there, and although the characters did stupid things from time to time, over all it wasn't bad. Until I got to season 5.<br/><br/>For some reason the writers decided to turn all the characters into hateful, self serving idiots, and then turn them all against each other. No loyalty, no honor, no nothing. I hated everyone in the show by the middle of season 5, including Walter the main character. It was like I spent 3 weeks binge watching each season and I was so disappointed by the last season that I regretted wasting my time watching the previous 4 episodes! I know there are no happy endings in life, but when I am wishing everyone would die just to put a show out of it's misery, that's pretty bad. Breaking Bad is not a bad show. It is very well produced, has good actors for the most part, some decent ideas, including a very good one that serves as the main plot, and is fast-paced enough to keep your interest. However, don't be fooled by other reviewers that Breaking Bad might actually be comparable to shows like 'The Wire', 'The Sopranos' or other series masterpieces. 'Breaking Bad' is more comparable to '24', a well executed popcorn series, that mixes action and suspense with a dark overtone. The writing is not quite as good as that of '24', but on the other hand it does not require as much suspension of disbelief as '24' does, even though 'Breaking Bad' also tends to become quite ridiculous in later seasons.<br/><br/>The first season was generally the best. It had a fresh idea and told it with a plan in mind. After that, the show gets a bit too unbelievable, repetitive, and popcornish. It'll probably hold your interest to the last minute, but much of it is style over substance, and you won't nearly get as much out of the series as you will out of shows such as 'The Wire' or 'Mad Men'. See at the bottom for explanation on strangely spelled words;<br/><br/>This story starts off with some potential interesting plots and continues with some potential angles and plots. But sadly nearly all of what goes on - i.e. makes out the content of the series is based on an increasing stupidity ! Yes, stupidity! The main character who is supposedly a 'very smart chemist' and more, eventually fails to make any planning ahead. He has no ability to voice himself. And so on and so on. It is even a surprise that he is able to buy a hamburger at Macnudles, or take a p iss... It is just so annoying how everything he does fails because he is to stupid to do anything and this creates 'entertainment'.. Well, there's one slight exception; There are some parts - I call them parts - that are cut into the action that does not belong to any part of the main story at all - like parts of some other movies were accidentally put random in to this series. But again and again and again and again I have to watch one of the stupidest of men who initially were portrayed to have an IQ above (yes above) 50.... It becomes so annoying to look at all this stupidity - almost like me repeating myself now (only 1000 times worse). From another IMDb User: IMDb - you clowns. don't tell me there are prohibited words without telling me what the hell they are you time wasting goofs. For everyone else reading this. "P i ss ed" is a prohibited word. Can you believe this fuking sht? --- End Other User. Well, I started watching Breaking Bad for a the hype about it. Always rated as best tv show in youtube videos, and I read so many good reviews about it. When I started watching I wasn't impressed at all. Don't get me wrong, it is a good show, but certainly not the best in history; I mean like any of you who say Breaking Bad is the best have you watched Game of Thrones? Compring Game of Thrones to Breaking Bad is a crime in my opinion. Season one and two can be made a movie instead of twenty eposides full of boring scenes( breakfast scenes most of all). Season three and four it got a little better, more action and suspense going on. Season five is legendary, many events going, they finally started sacrificing characters. But the show never reached the hype about it. I wish I can understand why this show is rated 9.5. I don't believe the show should get a one star. I feel 8 would be fair. The only reason I gave it a one star is to help bring down the 9.5 rating. Because it definitely doesn't deserve that record breaking rating. I have seen the show twice and the first time I really enjoyed it. Some character were aggravating but I liked the story and the direction as well. But after a second watch made me fully understand why people like it but not understand the impressive rating. The characters are weak. Very weak delevopment overall The acting in this series is really incredible. You will be treated to some of the most compelling and captivating acting around, especially given its overall genre that generally doesn't aim higher than mediocrity. The main cast is beyond excellent and the characters they play are well-written and multifaceted. Even the secondary characters are up there, both in acting and in writing.<br/><br/>The series' main problem lies exactly with the writing, however. Initially, it feels like many episodes not so much develop the characters or the story as simply waste time. Towards the end, many episodes feel like there's not as much a story being developed as a series of excuses for another major character to die in some action-movie setpiece.<br/><br/>But to me much of the series' earlier strength seemed in how grounded both the premise and the plot were, while still being eventful. Killing somebody is difficult and requires disposing of the body; there is no honour among thieves; disarming somebody holding you at gunpoint is laughably impossible for the average Joe. I wish the series had quit while it was ahead and abandoned the weaker, less believable plotlines that began creeping in with Season 3 onwards.<br/><br/>In the end, it's worth a watch, and I don't regret spending time on it, but it's not quite as strong as the rave reviews suggest, in my opinion.<br/><br/>My ratings by season:
S1: 5
S2: 5
S3: 4
S4: 5
S5: 5 The best tv show ever but the ending is not that good This was one series that continued to get better each season. Bryan Cranston was great in the lead role. Fantastic show, great writers. The story follows in a logical way that would be believable if it were to actually happen. The supporting cast around Cranston was very good, and the list of actors brought in throughout the seasons added to the show, without many distractions. Sal the lawyer was always a pleasure to watch, and he added some humor while still retaining a character that seemed to fit in with the drama going on around him. Aaron Paul played the perfect accomplice. Everyone actually performed very well throughout the entire series. Jonathon Banks, Dean Morris, and Giancarlo Esposito really stood out also. I rated this 8/10 because i genuinely think it could of been better.<br/><br/>I liked it and kept watching it and it was a good series BUT in my personal opinion the ending could of been better..<br/><br/>We don't find out if Gretchen and Elliot ever give Walt Jr the money, we don't know what happens to Jesse after he drives off and I think Walt could of died in a better way too. There was just something missing from the ending that i cant quite put my finger on.<br/><br/>I enjoyed watching the series and will probably watch it again in the future but it is slightly over rated. It needed more action i think, season 4 was my favourite with the story line with Gus and Hank.<br/><br/>Maybe a 1 hour extra episode just to wrap everything up in a nice tidy bow would be good.<br/><br/>Its worth watching though still. 8/10 from me. So I started watching this show after seeing a lot of people recommend it and after spending the last month watching it I have to say it's very average.<br/><br/>From season one it started out slow paced with the main character constantly making decisions that I as a viewer wanted him to make 3 episodes earlier. Granted this show is all about the main character Walt going from high school teacher to drug dealer so it's not going to happen over night.<br/><br/>The real problem I have found with this show is the fact that the characters don't have a likable nature to them, the main character is a 50 year old high school teacher who flashes into the character everyone wants to see then back out into this boring old guy who makes the whole show slow down.<br/><br/>Overall the show is OK but not great. Honestly, I don't know if it was the hype around it before I started to watch it, but I simply don't see what others see. I see a slow plot, with many filler episodes, a countless number of irrelevant content, characters that aren't lovable enough and a show not getting to the pint quick enough. As much as I want to love this show and give it a 10, I can't, and the only reason I'm not going any lower in my rating is because of Bryan Cranston...he deserves all of the praise he is getting. He is a great actor. <br/><br/>I can't understand the hype around this show. Though I do admit to be at the beginning of season 5, this season has to be what it is hyped up to be, in order to get my tick of approval. 80 000 000$ + for -how many doses of the poison. That is- how many addicts - who are not appearing in this kind of art expression. This tv show addresses just a tip of an iceberg of this drug abuse world that exists next door. Last year , just in Albuquerque, a mother, a meth addict, was arrested after killing her own daughter and dismembered her in a bath tub.(google it) This is really dangerous drug that destroys peoples lives and that was not shown in the series . People are watching this show , and thinking just about the money and its mysterious flow but what about the families of those who was disposed in acid ? To much killing in the show for decorative purpose and to much white lies. Someone who is a gentle father can not be a gentle father if he can kill in cold blood. One must be false.
Cancer of the Planet grows in USA , and we must heal - all together, and start to see that there is no INVISIBLE, unimportant PEOPLE who do drugs and dies in films for effects, jokes, laughs etc ....you like the first few episodes. If you do, then great. If you don't, you will do what I did and waste a lot of time going through some tedious and mind numbing TV, constantly waiting for it to get better. It didn't for me. I didn't like any characters, the pace was painfully slow at times, episodes can be missed entirely and no one would care (fly!), and there was a lot of filler. I will say, the way it ended was excellent, but not enough for me to recommend sitting through series 1-4 to watch it I know the story is good but God that show was boring. I just couldn't binge watch it all at once. It took me like 3 months to watch. Some people think it is really worth it, well I think not! This review is my personal opinion about Breaking Bad, the way I looked at it. I do not have the intention to insult neither the producer, the actors or the people who liked the show (if you did, please be happy with it). You have the right to not read my review about it. <br/><br/>Last year I was finishing The Soprano's, which I believe, was a very very great show! I was looking for something new, and I heared people talking all the time about "Breaking Bad" which is thought to be awesome by many people and the story line sounds great. So I decided to install Netflix.<br/><br/>After the first 4 parts I stopped watching. I really could not be bothered what happened on the screen. But the lovers kept telling me I should watch further because I was not supposed to know what I was talking about. I tried again, and than stopped at part 9. Today i finished all parts of all seasons, and I let you know what I think about it. The good things:<br/><br/>1: The story Idea is great (a chemist teacher who ends up making a lot of money with cooking excellent meth).<br/><br/>2: Mr. Fring, he acts very well.<br/><br/>3: Hank, also a pretty good actor. <br/><br/>4: There are only 4 cool scenes in the entire show: 1. The Head on the Turtle. 2. Mr Fring who dies in an awesome way. (1 and 2 are Tarantino style). 3 Walt who make a tape in which he accuses Hank. 4. The shooting from the car in the last part(16).<br/><br/>5. Nothing else.<br/><br/>And now the reasons why I believe this show is Bad: <br/><br/>1. Very unrealistic human behavior. I do not believe what I see on the screen. The human interactions are so lost from reality. Human beings do not react like the people from the show. Even the worst sci-fi movie is more realistic than this. I have never seen a show or a movie where people behave so strange as in this one. <br/><br/>I give you a few examples: <br/><br/>A: Hank finds a mask in the desert which has imprints of the lab at school were Walt works. He asks Walt "you know this one?". Walt denies. 3 Seconds later they look at the inventory in the school, two maskes are missing. Hank does not bother, he does not find the behavior of Walt suspicious, no he arrests someone else from school because that one blowed a joint. That totally does not make sense to me. <br/><br/>B: Jesse gives his both friends a bit of meth he stole, and he asks them to sell it at a rehab (???). Whereas they had plenty people to sell it to in the first 2 seasons, they now looking for ex junks to sell to. Jesse asks to one: did you sell anything? Yes, 1 gram, he got replied. To whom? Jesse asks. He pointed out the other friend (who Jesse also gave drugs to sell to). How stupid is that??<br/><br/>C: Walter asks external cleaners to clean up the methlab. He know there are camera's and Fring is looking at him. <br/><br/>D: That plane crash, come on people!???<br/><br/>E: There are people fighting in Jesse's house, and Jesse cannot be bothered. He smokes a joint on the couch (yeah right). This would never happen in real life, even not at junks houses. F: That whole stupid scene where Hank had a set up with one dealer sitting on a couch outside and where Saul arranged a body double of "Heisenberger".<br/><br/>F: Hank gives his life to find Heisenberger, he even refuses a better job. And than, he got shot and end up in a hospital because of Heisenberger. A few weeks later his colleague from homicide visits Hank and tells him he has lead to a supermeth lab. You would expect Hank grabs his documents, because it is THE HOT LEAD to Heisenberger. But noÂ…Hank ignores this document and watches TV. I have never seen such a dull scene in my life before. <br/><br/>2. Annoying acting. Especially that stupid Jesse Pinkman with his particular look and his screaming all the time (even junks do not behave so stupid as he). Also Walther White acts like an idiot, with this particular stand all the time (legs wide out, arms stretched down) and screams all the time "Jessie, Jessie". And than that ridiculous black hat!. Skyler, Marie and that stupid son of Walter are annoying to. <br/><br/>3.Tuco, is supposed to be a very big criminal. But screams all the time and throws money to Walt and Jesse at a car dump. Criminals that level, do not behave to stupid like he. <br/><br/>4. Very boring and slow progression. Almost all the parts are the same. Nothing happens, but stupid scenes where things happen that never would happen in real life. Except for parts 7 to 13 from season 4. Those are somewhat OK, and make me the show to give a 4 instead of a 1 star. <br/><br/>5.The train robbery. Is done like the A-team. All of a sudden Jesse is smart and explains stuff to Todd as if he has an IQ of 151. <br/><br/>6.The flash forwards did not work for me. I was not curious what would happen in the next parts. Except for 1 particular flash forward where Walt has a gun in the back of his car. <br/><br/>7.No humor, no surprises (everything what happens is soooo predictable), no plot twists. <br/><br/>My conclusion: this show sucks big time mostly because of the unrealistic human interactions. The acting is very bad (Sesame Street level) and almost all scenes are very annoying. I did not catch me at all. I really wonder why most people like this show. The series is good and I enjoyed it especially the last season and the wonderful ending but its problem is boring in the first place this point reduces his pleasure.. Breaking bad is very good but boring at times. I would love the show if they got rid of Skyler early on that woman is extremely annoying and she made me wanna quit the show several times. I just had to skip scenes with her eventually. That asides I like that they made they made the show highly realistic based on some reality. Entertaining and enjoyable. Good season but many will find it boring but is one of the best The breaking bad is the best series in my opinion.
I think its much better than got. I really love this show and every thing related to it i give it 9.5 out of 10 because of slow story telling at the first couple seasons of the show but after that you literally can not stop watching this show. If there is any show that deserve 10/10 then it's Breaking Bad...!!! I watched many TV shows before this but I never felt this feeling. It was simply addictive, it was worth watching if you are a movie lover, then it would be the show you must watch. At first I felt like it was boring but when you are into this thing there is no going back. The character evolution was most satisfying and the end it was just an explosion..! S1 - 8.4/10
S2 - 8.8/10
S3 - 9.4/10
S4 - 9/10
S5 - 9.7/10 I first watched Breaking Bad when it ran on TV and eagerly awaited each season and episode. It was an amazing piece of work as Vince Gilligan crafted a wonderfully interesting and creative story with well defined characters who were allowed to develop over the course of the series and tell their story. I just recently watched Breaking Bad again on Netflix and fell in love with it all over again. I applaud Vince for having a start to the story, a middle and a definite end that he held to over the 5 seasons. He knew where he was going with it and helped it get there and then let it end. He did not allow the networks talk him into extending the story to squeeze another season out of it as they do with many other show. This should be required viewing for every budding producer or screenwriter as too how it can be done. It's my first review so i will not talk much , if you like good criminal this show is for you :) Episode by episode Walther becomes really really good :) Every episode i got chills and enjoyed it ... I don't really know what else i can say :) This show is very good , today's television needs more shows like this one :) Preview: 1.Good 2.Very Good 3.Intense episodes 4.Good story 5.Great characters 6.Rate speaks for itself 7.Very very good show!The series starts off a bit slow after the first couple of episodes but then takes off from there. This show was very well written and one of those shows in which I had to watch the new episode right away. I actually watched this series twice and was just as good the second time around. Breaking bad is really excellent show i have ever seen hats-off to everyone from actors to crew member. i like jesse pinkman the dialog (yo bitch) i loved the way he speak and Mr. walter white has done a great job this show has all thinks like drama,action etc.<br/><br/>the BEST TV DRAMA SERIES of ALL TIME Breaking Bad After so many lugubrious turns, "Breaking Bad" came to an end on Sunday on an almost uplifting note.<br/><br/>Running since 2008..5 Glorious SEASONS & 62 clinching EPISODES & rating of 9.5/10 on IMDb & 99/100 on Metacritic it ended with the MOST SATISFYING FinalE ever..Watched by 10.3 million viewers.<br/><br/>A simple story of a chemistry teacher making blue meth for providing his family with his former student teaches us every important meaning of LIFE.With very REAL/GREAT/EXTRAORDINARY performance by Bryan Cranston & created by Vince Gilligan this TV Series blowned my MIND..totally.<br/><br/>I have watched so many Great English TV Series like The Walking Dead, Modern Family, The Big Bang Theory, Supernatural, Firefly & Sherlock also but this was PURE GENIUS.All Hail The King HEISENBERG!!! What's not to love with this show? Vince Gilligan has a masterpiece in every aspect with Breaking Bad. This show takes you through a story of Mr. White as he goes from Chemistry teacher to drug kingpin. How does such a simple teacher turn into one of the most insanely entertaining characters in TV history? Gilligan figured out how in the most profound way with Breaking Bad. Walter White gets diagnosed with cancer and teams up with local drug dealer and former student Jesse Pinkman. The duo seems unorthodox, but they make it work. Through the story, Walt has to deal with family problems, issues with other drug dealers, and the law. The story starts slower to develop the characters, but as everyone is introduced, the story picks up into one wild ride. This show has the best character development of any TV show that I have ever seen. Walter White goes from quiet teacher to the craziest anti-hero that has ever been imagined, and his parter Jesse Pinkman goes from a small time dealer to someone who just wants to survive. The challenges are larger than life and at times Jesse finds it all to be too much, much because of Mr. White himself. These two are a duo of a lifetime. Because of how fantastic this show is, there is no surprise that Breaking Bad has won countless awards and recognitions along the way. There really is nothing wrong with the show as it keeps your attention all the way to the last scene. Truly worth the time to sit and appreciate quite possibly the greatest show of all time! So this is the one and only movie or television show I've ever given a 10. This is the best television show I've ever seen. Nothing else has ever rung more true than the script and performances in BB. Nothing more I can say about it. Perfect script, casting, acting, cinematography, foreshadowing, this is the benchmark now for TV and I'll be waiting for some ambitious genius to come along and try and take its heavyweight championship belt away. Watch it 2 or 3 times to take in all the juxtaposition and appreciate all the nuances. I'm not perceptive enough to catch it all the first time around. Bryan Cranston's extensive comedy experience lends just the right amount of levity to keep this drama true to life. Just go watch it. It's brilliant. What is there to say? It's Breaking Bad.<br/><br/>I could go on at length about it, but there's not much left to be said that others haven't said before. The writing is great, the acting is as well. It's easy to get lost in the story, and even the episodes that seem a little lacking compared to some of the others in the series are still very good. <br/><br/>Looking at the long list of Golden Globes, Emmys, and other awards that Breaking Bad has received makes it clear I'm not alone in this opinion. It would be an achievement to continue a coherent story like this just for a single episode, but to do it over the entire series as you watch Walter's transformation from a science teacher to a killer and drug lord is nothing short of amazing. I can easily say that, Breaking Bad is one of the best TV series I have ever seen. Set in Albuquerque, the series follows the life of a high school chemistry teacher, Walter White (brilliantly played by Bryan Cranston), who was diagnosed with terminal cancer at the beginning of the first series. <br/><br/>Breaking Bad tracked Walt's transformation from a decent, excellent high school teacher to criminal mastermind and the transition of his character. The mild-mannered high school chemistry teacher Mr. White comes to that point where he thinks that life can't get any worse. Learning that he has terminal cancer, and realising that his illness probably will ruin his family financially, Walt becomes desperate to secure his family's future before he dies, turning to a life of crime, making/cooking and selling methamphetamine, as a result, he ruined his own family and the lives of several others in the process. However, in the tensioned final half hour, somehow he won back a measure of both sympathy and respect - not least by surrendering the pretence that he's done it all for his family. At last Walt told Skyler: "I did it for me," "I liked it. I was good at it." "I was ALIVE!"<br/><br/>One way or another, Heisenberg ticked off every item on his unfinished business list, while the scenes slipped by at their customary stately pace, wasting his enemies, settling a score with his old rivals, freed his protégé, apologised to his wife and ensuring that his children would - someday - get the drug money he believes they deserve.<br/><br/>The series delivered everything that has been great about Breaking Bad: tension, emotion, pathos, brutality, humour, jaw-dropping shocks – and last, but not least: resolution.<br/><br/>Jesse Pinkman's character, intensely played by Aaron Paul, giving a memorable performance in the show and building a natural chemistry with the lead character, Mr. White – and exceptional play of an Exceptional actor: Bryan Cranston.<br/><br/>Beautifully written by Vince Gilligan, carefully directed by a great team, with plot twists coming in refreshing ways, brilliant acting, absolutely great cast – couldn't get any better.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad might not be perfect, but is definitely a great piece of art. This is maybe the second (if not the only) review I had posted a score of 10 on.<br/><br/>Setting, story, plot, direction, production, acting = remarkable and very rewarding for your entertainment time.<br/><br/>Most series one can enjoy and then there's this little itch that ruins your high rating, but Breaking Bad is all good from all viewpoints.<br/><br/>The violence involved is a semi-realistic portrayal of how the criminal world lives every minute by, without hesitation.<br/><br/>The entire production is very unique (especially the starting and the ending of each episode) .. there is nothing more that I could say except this: Watch it if you haven't already! Pure ten! The quality of the series just goes on and that the plot is progressing which is really rare. The second half of the 4th season and complete the fifth top peaks, no bad episodes, tense, almost every episode superb finishes. The entire fifth complete the best season ever! There dare I say it! Acting excellent, the script also. Come on, so I will not tell anything new. Oh details! Oh, how I was pleased to follow, some small detail may not go after him, but I just go and when you notice something and completed it and it turns out you're right. : yay: I greatly appreciate what they decided to do (only) season 5, but frickin good, than prostitute through the 10 or so season just for the money and viewer ship. The first season was the worst when compared to others. Warmly recommended. Malcolms father can really act What a sublime and religious experience it was to watch this series. Bryan Cranston has become a great favorite of mine. The series portrays him as a chemistry teacher Walter White, who is making ends meet by also working as a cashier in a garage after school hours.<br/><br/>One day he collapses. He finds out that he has lung cancer and not long to live. He decides to set aside a large sum of money for his family before he dies - partly to satisfy his ego and partly for the love of his family. He gets his inspiration from Hank Schrader his wife's brother-in -law who is a DEA agent. Hank invites Walter to a drug bust where he spies a dropout student of his Jesse Pinkman(Aaron Paul) discretely sneak away. Walter follows Jesse and tells him of a plan to start-up a meth lab and make a lot of money for themselves. They make a vow of complete secrecy.<br/><br/>The series then deals with unforeseeable events that arise when it comes to selling the meth discretely without drawing the attention of the DEA. Walter wants to sell the meth in large quantity, but Jesse tells him not to rush it and keep selling it in small amounts while still making a good sum of money. Walter keeps on pushing Jesse and we see the first tragic consequence of that action. From then onwards, it is a roller coaster ride full of highs and lows till the inevitable end of the trip. <br/><br/>The series is filled with colorful characters that you will remember for a lifetime, and an ending that will take your breath away...<br/><br/>More TV shows to see: Tales From The Crypt 1989, Masters Of Horror 2005, Fear Itself 2008, Tales From The Darkside 1983, The Twilight Zone 1985, The Outer Limits 1995. I just finished this series, at 6-6-2015<br/><br/>Being introduced by a relative into the series-craze, I'm kind of a late starter. I first saw the 'Better call Saul' series..which came after Breaking Bad but it plays before that time...which is brilliant...as everything about it is.<br/><br/>I have nothing to add to what is already said, I guess. Breaking Bad is not just a TV-series, it's a piece of art, made by the most critical of filmmakers to satisfy even the most critical of film viewers.<br/><br/>The way they created a cinematic puzzle that all fits, let the viewer use his own imagination at first, and then comes up with an even better solution every time, is a joy.<br/><br/>Every genre is represented at it's finest, humor, horror, love, family, drama, crime, thriller, you name it, this series's got it. Mindbending, totally unexpected twists.<br/><br/>I hesitated a little before giving this the full score...but there's nothing better out there that's made so good within the created lives of ordinary people. How could they make this better? Normally I have tons of ideas...with this series, I really have not.<br/><br/>Therefore: a 10. where do I start!... after watching this entire series start to finish I can say this series puts almost every emotion you can think of into every episode I have watched episodes where I have been sad, annoyed, left in shock and on many occasions laughed so much I have near enough drowned in my own laughter tears Bryan Cranston plays Walter white a once respected school chemistry teacher diagnosed with lung cancer too crystal meth cook and Aaron Paul plays Jesse Pinkman an ex failed student of Mr whites who now cooks sells and takes methamphetamine on a regular basis the pair form an unstoppable team when they find Mr white can make the perfect 'blue' meth the series shows the brutality of the illegal drug industry and the real horrendous affects that can be caused by the drug while Walter attempts to hid the fact that he is a major drug king pin from his wife and son while trying too also raise a baby daughter the show shows both Walter and Jesse's rises and falls and there health slowly worsens while adding some unforgettable funny moments in too.<br/><br/>a must see series 10/10! I usually don't write reviews, but I felt i HAD to for this epic series. For the past 3 years my brother has been bugging me to watch Breaking Bad, and finally I got around to it after moving to a Greek island, thus having more free time on my hands. All I can say is WOW. I can't believe what I missed the past 5 years! After watching the full 5 series in less than 2 weeks, I was left speechless after most episodes, and wanted more, sometimes taking me into the night until 2-3 am. Every episode is brilliantly written, directed, & produced. What can I say about the acting? Every single actor in this series deserves the highest awards. This show will go down as one of the all time greatest (if not THE BEST). HEISENBERG forever! When talking about TV shows Breaking Bad is bound to be mentioned. Why? Because its unlike anything else on TV, the acting is better in this TV show, than quite a lot of movies, combined. The writers thought out every last detail, and made a compelling, incredibly acted TV show, that you will never forget after watching it. <br/><br/>I usually don't follow trends/popular TV shows and such, and I had heard of Breaking Bad, but never really paid much mind to it, and thought to myself "why is this show so popular". So a friend of mine said it was awesome, so I gave it a shot. One season became 2, then 3 Until I finished it. It is truly an experience, and a roller coaster ride of emotions. The acting is incredible, as is the writing and directing. Just an amazing show that needs to be seen. -10/10 It doesn't happen very often that I'm not sad when a TV show ends: I'm not sad just because Breaking Bad could not have been done better. There are 5 season, and each one is good. They succeeded in keeping an high level for the whole TV show duration. It is never expect, never trivial. There are no good or evil men, no black or white, but everything is gray, every character is perfectly built. Bryan Cranston...what could I say? I think him to be one of the most talented actors in the world. You don't know if to love or to hate him. The most part of today TV shows are full of nudity, violence etc., but Breaking Bad had a great success also without these elements: there should be a reason, don't you think? If you want to find out what it is, just watch it, you will not regret this! Enjoy it! *SPOILER ALERT* Breaking Bad stars Bryan Cranston as Walter White, a chemistry teacher with terminal lung cancer who, in order to afford chemo therapy and to care for the child that he has on the way, cooks and distributes crystal meth. If you didn't understand from that first sentence, understand from this sentence that this is not a show that is meant for kids. This show deals with obviously the drug industry, violence, prostitution and much more. But for those who know about all these things, Breaking Bad may just be for you. With Bryan Cranston as the lead and Aaron Paul beside him as Jesse Pinkman, a junkie who helps White to sell the meth, it's the recipe for the perfect drama. Cranston and Aaron both put energy into their characters, them ALONE are enough to watch this show. Even the side characters are amazingly interesting. And the plot is one of the best parts of the show. If you've missed the series while it was on AMC like I did, get on Netflix and binge watch it. Breaking Bad is my absolute favorite show it will not disappoint drama lovers. I give AMC's Breaking Bad the highest score I can give a 10/10. I knew Breaking Bad was going to be amazing when I first saw the pilot. It had potential beyond my expectations, as the episodes went on I felt like I was going deeper and deeper inside the mind of my favorite anti-hero of all time; Walter White. This show is up there with greats such as The Sopranos and The Wire. I must thank Vince Gilligan and his mad genius for making this show possible and giving me 5 brilliant seasons, the only show that has had 5/5 perfect seasons (so far, I think True Detective has potential). The writing is amazing and the dialogue seems so real, it's also given us some of the most iconic quotes in television history, such as "bi***", "I am not in danger, I am the danger", "I am the one who knocks" and so much more. I can guarantee you that Breaking Bad is the greatest show of all time. some people say for this series that everything bad must come to an end which is not completely true. everything both good or bad must come to an end. This is by far one of the best TV series ever. This series keeps getting better and better as the season progressed. Its not an action packed series but when they come they blow your mind. This is really serious and dark drama series but with great comedy scenes in them. Its not sitcom comedy but more of situation based. <br/><br/>This series also show the dark side of drug world. No matter how people try their hardest to act 'its just all fun' or 'its just another business' this is just not true. As soon as the main characters enter into drug scene they started facing extremely evil people one after another and no matter how much both Walter and Jesse tried to stay away from violence, it was just impossible in the world of Drugs. And before they could do anything they were deep into it and now to survive they started to turn into the same evil people.<br/><br/>Actions have consequences and they started to pile up for both Walt and Jesse, the only thing helping both guys to survive was the brilliance of Walt and Loyalty of Jesse. As the brilliance started to get more evil, Loyalty was shading away and once it was gone everything started to break. <br/><br/>The series is slow in the start but it just keep getting better and builds up the story for its extreme jaw dropping moments. This series is so good that once my friends (who were new to American TV) watched it they don't like anything anymore.<br/><br/>Even though the dark theme of the series and some really gruesome events happening throughout the series, it was still keeping a standards of more like PG-13 level of evilness except season 5. Because of 2nd last episode, season 5 is now on last best season in my list(of breaking bad). that episode didn't required at all. disturbing content of season 5 push it to Rated-R level. <br/><br/>Anyways Still the best TV series out there. The people who don't like extreme violence can still enjoy this series. Usually I don't write reviews , but after watching this TV series twice i was bound to write this review. I 've tried to keep it short. The season 1 starts with our 'HERO' Walter white and his sidekick Jesse pinkman struggling with their daily lives. Then Mr.white gets to know about his cancer and he decides to break bad after suffering all of his life . In the process he befriends Jesse pinkman and starts to cook meth( This is the base plot. No spoilers.). In this process several situations are faced by our hero and his family. With many hilarious situations and thrilling twists we watch this show called 'Breaking Bad'.<br/><br/>SCREENPLAY AND WRITING: This is the strongest part of the show. Attention is given to every minute details. Very strong detailing . The chemistry part of the show is also very accurate. The creator Vince Gilligan along with the other writers has written some fantastic stuff. The best since 'The Sopranos'. The actors get to perform to their peak because of the tight writing . The stories are very relate able to our real lives, you can feel the helplessness of Mr.white or the agony of Jesse. Simply outstanding. I have to mention the episode 'Ozymandia', its insanely brilliant , i've watched the episode like 50 times( Seriously , i'm not exaggerating). The first two seasons are for story building and character build up. The real havoc starts from third season . Each is multiplying brilliant than its previous. I mean it. The writing is so strong that every episode grows on you, though you have to patient in the first two seasons but you are waiting for fireworks ,sister! There are some insanely funny scenes which nicely blends with the drama.<br/><br/>ACTING: Well what can i say about it , its the best i've seen on the television. Bryan Cranston has got into my list of top 10 actors . I cant imagine anyone playing Walter White except him. The transition of a good family man to a bad-ass drug lord , Cranston makes it believable. It seems that he is unapologetic of his actions but deep inside he is guilty. Each and every reaction of his under any circumstances is just so unreal i'll say , the way he does it ,its, its just (every positive superlatives in the dictionary). Now we come to Jesse Pinkman played by Aaron Paul ,my favorite character. Paul is so good that he will make you fall in love with Jesse . The way he burst out his angst , his agony , his sorrows , his loneliness is commendable , he deserves every allocades for his work . The chemistry between Mr.White and Jesse is a delight to watch. In some scenes Aaron makes look Cranston an average actor (yes he is that good) . Their complex relation gets even complex with each season . They are a delight. Then there is Anna Gunn playing Skylar White. Man she is damn hot!!! But she is a hotter actress. She completes Walter white ,without her white is very much incomplete. In the emotional scenes she is the one to beat (Paul is equally good). There are dozen of actors who should get a description like this,but it would be very exhaustive process. But i would like to tell you they are equally good as Cranston, Paul and Anna. <br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT : I could discuss a 100 page review with you all , that much i've to say for it. I would say i m addicted to it . Yes , it is the best show ever , though i've not seen all the shows, but i don't need to . I can guarantee you , you have not experienced something this never before and never will you after this. It will grow on you like a virus. Specially the last season is a blockbuster, and the finale is ... Man i've no words. Please watch it . You'll regret it for your whole lifetime if you wont watch it. You are in for a cracker. Hope you all will find this review helpful. Why you ask? Because it had me hooked from the start. I just finished watching it over for the second time. And still, knowing what was going to happen, I could not wait for the next episode. <br/><br/>Sure it's not for everyone.. If you'd rather have an action packed show filled with gun fights and tits in your face, this isn't for you. But when you do have the patience and understand what's going on.. This show will not disappoint you. <br/><br/>Characters are very well acted out by the very good actors. You really feel for them. Whether they do good or wrong. They had me hating some people on the show with so much passion.. My point, you can really get in to it. Relate with them. <br/><br/>If you haven't seen the show yet, I'm jealous because you're in for one hell of a ride. Definitely a must see show! I would like to start off by saying, I never review a single thing. This show was so worthy of it I cannot believe it's over. Lucky it wasn't strung on though. From watching other AMC originals I knew this was going to be great from the start. At first the story is slow but once it takes off it takes off. Bryan makes a phenomenal actor when it comes to this show but I personally loved watching Jesse, played by Aaron Paul, a former student of Walters and junkie who hooks you without knowing it. The twists and turns in this show is what makes it absolutely astounding. This is a MUST watch that should be on everyone's bucket list.<br/><br/>The plot is amazing; a man not being able to pay his bills, later on finding out he has lung cancer and decides the reasonable thing to do is stock pile for his family after he is gone. For the plot alone I give it 5 star rating but during the plot Walter changes his way of doing things and becomes, a monster so to speak, which bumps it up to a 7 star review. The action and the quick on the feet decision making, tied in with great music, back stories, well played cast members, and every little detail being stitched together at least by the very end is what won my 10 star review and what won them all the awards. <br/><br/>If you want a show that will make you fiend for more, this IS the show. Grab you a chair and enjoy. I promise you though once it's over it's over. I myself don't want to believe it is but...Yeah <br/><br/>(If you have sensitive ears loud high pitched tones do sound frequently) You can't think of a TV series this good,,to be fact bound this is probably the best work done on an electronic device which has a display(TV..:)), Bryan Cranston is so so addictive that if you have ever had METH you could survive its scarcity in times of need but when it comes to watching him act your urge will kill you. i think this much is enough to review a title this "great"...in fact a new word to define the excellence of this TV series should be mentioned. "Methylvalous". To talk about the supporting cast Aaaron Paul has done a fantastic job,,in fact a fantastic act.he portrays a character of a spoilt school going brat who is secretively into making meth along side his schooling to earn money and goes on to partner his school chemistry teacher(Bryan Cranston) in making the world's purest blue meth. Anna Gunn,Dean Norris,Betsy Brandt and of course Wlater Jr. do play their part very well. All in all you cannot ask for a more Dark comical tragic Thriller TV serial. For at least a year I had people coming up to me and trying to talk about Breaking Bad. I said yeah yeah, sounds great but it's not a pay channel - therefore there's no nudity, gore and F bombs. Not for me. Boy, was I wrong. <br/><br/>This show is so good you don't mind the slight censorship. There's enough swearing, chicks and blood to satisfy you. We all know that Bryan Cranston knocked his role out of the park, but he's not the only one. I loved his brother in law and Aaron Paul was really, really good. Jonathan Banks was super as well. <br/><br/>This is the only show where I can say that I got a big kick out of every single episode. It's like the writers know what you want to see and they bring it every time. Not too much, not too little, just the perfect pacing for a story. I was sorry to see it end. I'm pretty excited to write the 600th review for Breaking Bad. This show had kept me awake at nights as I wanted to watch just one more episode. It truly is the best of TV shows I have watched.<br/><br/>In terms of acting, Bryan Cranston has beaten everyone in playing the good and the bad. It has been this change in the major characters that leaves you with a weird feeling in the end. You don't even know whether to feel bad, pity on W.W. and Jesse or plain sadness about all that happened. It is this feeling that makes this show one of the greatest. <br/><br/>I do agree that Season# 3 was a blunder and it kept sort of dragging things up for no reasons, but Season#4 and 5 makes up for anything and everything.<br/><br/>The only verdict that this show can have : The best show ever !! Breaking Bad will never fail to surprise you. You will see some of the finest acting seen in a show by Bryan Cranston. You will also see the rise of Hollywood actor Aaron Paul. Breaking Bad breaks boundaries, the change of Walter White into one 'Heisenberg' is truly phenomenal. Every cast member is not only good but amazing. I cannot mention some villains to Walt and Jesse as it will ruin the experience, every villain makes you hate them but will possibly make you root for their purpose because Vince Gilligan presents why each villain does what they do. Season one and two may seem slow but all will come together as season three, four and five will make the show tense, gripping, shocking and yet so enjoyable. So if you don't find the start to be of your taste continue to watch and the wait will be worth it! This show is simply the best.<br/><br/>All Hail The King,Walter White. It's the story of a man, an overachieved teacher who could not stand his miserable life anymore. He got so angry and so human that he get's to the dark side. Well it's not easy to turn back when you get there is it? This series shows the human nature, the realism of a simple teacher tryng to became the CEO of a criminal empire. For those who became a bit curious if it's possible, without creating a comic's or ultra fantasy scrip, this is the one to watch. Breaking Bad explore it's characters and make you become part of their world, make you so close to them that you feel in your skinny their difficulties and issues. Their goals and what their are giving up. But above all it's about a men and how power can change him, slow and brutally. I've watched this series twice now, and the acting and writing are so good, that I can defy you to watch this and not love it!!!!<br/><br/>The season ending episode, is so good, that even after having watched it maybe 10 times now, I still pick up little things that I did not catch the first times around.<br/><br/>The last few minutes are RIVETING... to say the least, and the very last scene in the met lab, when they started the music from Badfinger, was so spot on, that even the words to the song, described Walt to a T!!!<br/><br/>It is a long series ( 62 episodes ), but personally I wish it would have never ended, it is that good! Breaking Bad is without doubt the ultimate hardass TV show. Developed by Vince Gilligan and Broadcasted on the AMC network from 2008-2013. Breaking Bad tells the story of chemistry teacher Walter White (Bryan Cranston)who has been diagnosed with stage 3 lung cancer resorting to making Meth (Methamphetamine) so that his family will have enough money to survive after he is gone.<br/><br/>From the outset we can see the character walter white like himself living a clean honorable lifestyle working two jobs to keep afloat his pregnant wife and disabled son. After Walter is diagnosed with lung cancer he decideds one day to go for a ride along with his brother in law Hank who is a DEA agent about to bust a Meth dealer. Walter notices a former student of his Jessie (Aaron Paul) escaping a Meth house and soon tracks him down to discuss the possibility of a business partnership where Walter makes the Meth and Jessie distributes. <br/><br/>Breaking Bad was the kind of show that went from strength to strength every season. From Walter being a mild mannered high school teacher who's intentions seemed honorable to a feared well known drug maker who uses the alias Heisenberg. This is a show that along with great progressive writing, violence, drug making and the ultimate good to bad story makes is one HARDASS TV show.<br/><br/>www.hardasstv.com This TV show was the very first thing to get me seriously interested in cinematic glory. It's perfect script, amazing acting, and stellar cinematography leave me knowing that without a doubt this show will be remembered through history. Every episode leaves you thirsty for more and willing to choke someone with a bike lock to get it. With each season the epic tale of walter white gets increasingly better. I applaud every single person who worked on this show and I hope it's spin off can bring me as much love as breakingbad did.<br/><br/>The story gives you a dramatic look into the life of a dying man, who knows that very soon he will die, leaving nothing to his family. This drives him to become the greatest drug dealer that ever lived and his greed leads to the very fall of his empire, and it is shown to you in such elegance that I can help but believe it to be the greatest piece of cinematic glory to come to your TV. This show is simply flawless!!! They have picked brilliant actors who were really amazing!!! None of them were famous but they gave a magnificent performance, better than many Hollywood actors!! Especially Aaron Paul, he came from nowhere but amazed everybody!! His astonishing performance made us laugh,and even cry!! I think he is a very talented actor who deserves a 3rd Emmy, better than all the other nominees! As a conclusion, This show really deserves a 10.0 evaluation!!<br/><br/>P.S: Thanks for Vince Gilligan for creating this wonderful show!! It is the most brilliant show I have ever seen in my entire life! I hope {Better Call Saul} be just as wonderful as this show is!! NEVER written a review before this but this show was worth the exception. <br/><br/>I put off watching this show for SO long as I didn't want to get caught in the hype. So many people were talking about it and after watching it, I see perfectly why. The wittiness, subtle comedic value, the attention to detail, the character build up, the story development, the cinematography, the camera angles. I could go on and on. The writers did a flawless job. Absolutely love this show and 10 put of 10 is entirely deserved!!! <br/><br/>***** ***** ***** I sincerely believe that everyone here has lived through one of the greatest shows in the history of TV. I highly doubt another series will surpass Breaking Bad - the calibre of the show was just unbelievable. The acting; breathtaking. The plot; riveting...heartbreaking. The writers; genius. The soundtrack; compelling. The character development; unparallelled. Everything about this show was unforgettable, and there's a huge breaking bad shaped void in my life that I will never be able to fill. <br/><br/>Thank you to everyone involved in the making of Breaking Bad, because it was, quite simply, perfect. ﻿ Catharsis . That's the word that best defines the end of Breaking Bad. A sort of purification not only of its main character, Walter White, but also to an audience that applauded and celebrated the adventures of a criminal who , although started with the best of intentions , contaminated the dirty streets with poison. Killed to achieve their goals enough to make it impossible to dodge the costs of regaining the esteem of a child who idolized him . One for dodging the law to be in quiet solitary cancer victim , was not an option.<br/><br/>In Breaking Bad was a way to go , not foreseeable but inevitable that Vince Gilligan and the team of seven writers of the series thankfully decided to go, instead of trying to go for the empty last minute surprise . Something that we are used with both the north-American television series, more over, stretching gum over the account . Hence it is finalized , the way it materialized , the brand therefore deserved great character and the people who made ​​him an icon. Tying up loose ends in a final round , satisfactory, not demolished expectations. Breaking Bad is honestly one of a kind. I have never in my life seen a programme so incredible, after a few episodes you will be hooked. Like most people who have seen the 5 series Thriller, I finished all five in around 10 days or so. The Series is just so unique and original, it is remarkable how a show about a Meth-Dealing Cancer patient can impact someones life so much, the show is entertaining, comical, but yet can also teach the audience lessons on empathy, the overall five seasons focus on the downfall of Walt, how he begins as the lovable friendly family man who is severely overqualified for his work, and doesn't have much to show for his life, he uses his wasted intelligence in a get rich quick scheme, hoping to leave plenty of money for his children before his inevitable demise. The irony of the show is unbelievable, Walt on his pursuit to become the ultimate Drug-Lord, spends much of his time with his DEA brother-in-law, who is surprisingly oblivious that Walter could be involved in the case which he has spent the best years of his career chasing. Hank does come close on some occasions to exposing Walt, but Walt risks his life many times to keep his Drug Kingpin alter-ego hidden. Vince Gilligan is a phenomenal writer, and each episode appears to be even better then the previous, it takes a literary genius to leave almost every episode on a cliffhanger, making you crave more episodes. At the mid-season break in season 4, Gilligan even makes it seem like Walter could actually get away with the last year of his life, in which his drastic downfall occurs, the pushing-away of his wife, Skylar, as well as his cerebral palsy suffering son, Junior. The irony of how Hank realizes Walter is the 'Heisenberg' who he has been hunting for years, makes the audience sit on the edge of their seat, gagging for the next episode to come. Breaking bad is original, unique in it's time and honestly, one in a million. Even in the finale, it is amazing how the audience still has much empathy for Walt, despite his inner demons overtaking his good- nature. Crime does pay or maybe not. The entire series revolves around drugs from cooking, substance abuse to consequences. To me anything to do with drug movies is just plain boring. Bunch of junkies sticking it up their veins and drug cartels running rings. However, the approach to this drama is new. The suspense packed episodes overdose you and make you an addict yourself to the show. Acting is excellent and the entire cast does justice to their scripts. Most of the characters are so well developed that even the bad guys leave a lasting impression. If you want to watch a good series nothing gets better. Most TV shows fizzle out after 1-3 seasons this one keeps getting you the chills. Get the series now and a must watch for all. Its not just about drugs there is more than it meets the eye. The best series of all time, almost with no negatives, almost PERFECT!!! The first season was good, well represented what was upcoming to the viewers. The second season was simply amazing to the point that I would never imagine that would be better. Then came the third season, better and stronger than the second, mostly due to the Cousins presence, and Hank's evolution, allied to the amazing Gus Fring. Then four season perplexed me with the first episode "Box Cutter" and as well the last, "End Times". To end, the fifth season was perfect, no negative points, it was completely perfect, Todd's presence and development, as well the Jack's White Supremacy Gang and Lydia was the strongest points of the season, developing a plot better and better with Hank, Jesse and Mr White. The episodes "Gliding Over All", "To'Hajiilee", "Ozymandias", "Granite State" and "Felina" proved that Breaking Bad was the best series of all time. "We're done when I say we're done!"<br/><br/>I probably haven't been hooked to a TV show like I have to Breaking Bad before. I personally admire the fact that the show pulls no punches. I find myself pausing at the fact that I am so intrigued by this hard core street wise program, more than any of the other big name series. This one really hits home and gives a true behind the scenes look at what most would consider the bad guys. I'm not condoning the contents of the story, and I don't think the show is either, there is no glamor in what these boys are doing, but it's giving an insight to the darker side of many streets.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad serves as a revelation, it's like watching a butterfly emerge from a chrysalis, Bryan Cranston delivers a heart-breaking performance as Walter White, an over-qualified chemistry teacher who discovers that he has cancer. This discovery completely changes his perspective on life, the realization that his mediocre life could soon be over and he has little to show for it triggers a change in life that simply leads from one amazing drama to the next.<br/><br/>Crystal meth is not something taken lightly in any drama, the show tackles these issues admirably by showing the ups and downs of dealing, the unsavory characters who Walter meets along his journey. What makes this show different is that it doesn't glamorize drugs; it does show what a human being is capable of put into various characters who Walt meets along his journey. What makes this show different is that it doesn't glamorize drugs, it does show what a human being is capable of put into various circumstances.<br/><br/>The atmosphere of the show is intense, epitomized by the brutal heat of Albequerque in which the characters often find themselves. The suspense and tension throughout is nerve wrecking. And then there are the shocks. The scream out loud moments.<br/><br/>The acting is what is really glorifying from every character. That being said Aaron Paul is magnificent, in fact it was decided not to kill off the character on the strength of his performance. He's a no-nonsense guy who does drugs and then tries to go clean; he falls in love; he cares about children - he must run the gamut of emotions in the series' five years. His relationship with Walt is sometimes compatible, sometimes antagonist, sometimes dangerous, and often frightening. Aaron is the good guy who does illegal things, but doesn't have Walt's mean streak.<br/><br/>The direction and writing in the show are top-notch and one is really surprised by how much you care and are involved by the characters. The cinematography is of the quality of an Oscar- winning film, as is the editing and the other technical aspects of the show.<br/><br/>Bryan Cranston's transformation is one riveting and absorbing performance as he moves towards the dark side, believable on both ends. As his drug whacked assistant follows suit while creator Vince Gilligan over the first four and a half seasons keeps a tight grip on storyline by introducing a series of intriguing and comic characters pertinent to the telling, keeping it buoyant and suspenseful with some powerful twists.<br/><br/>The creator, writers, directors and actors have paid attention to every single detail, putting thought into every nuance in every character in every scene. Because of this attention to detail there is something of everyone in this show. Every thinking brain will immediately be attracted to the intelligence so evidently on display, that even if you're not a drug dealing chemist in Albuquerque, you will find something in the characters that connects you to them and makes you hang on for dear life.<br/><br/>This is without a doubt one of the best shows out on television, it's great for any thrill-seekers that envy a good suspense and a terrific show. Some people are put off by the subject matter of this show but that should not put you off if you don't watch the show, you are missing out greatly. For these reasons Breaking Bad gets a 10/10. This is an outstanding piece of work.The direction, the screen play , actors everything is just amazing.Every episode was just great and not a single wrong chord was stuck.To be glued to it is an under statement from my part.<br/><br/>The climax , the way characters have been sketched was just mind blowing.I was sad that it ended but every good thing comes to an end and that was the best part of the show that it was not stretched.It was such a great end to the show.<br/><br/>In today's world there are so many form of entertainment and you have so many choices.Why do i watch a TV show and what makes me write a review for that show? Because I have never seen something like this. May be I have seen less ! Breaking Bad is my favorite show, and in my opinion, one of the best TV shows ever. This show has been made from the ground up to create something so amazing, that it's going to get a prequel some time this year to keep things going. Basically, it's like nothing is going to stop the train (you'll get that reference later).<br/><br/>The character development in this show is mind-blowing. It can make a completely sane person in the show go into a deep state of depression, or someone who is a horrible person who has done horrible things. Yes, that's an important factor in any show, but in this show, you get to compare these characters from the beginning of the series to the final season and not recognize them. Not only physically, but in their emotional state, as well. The story plays a much more important factor in that, as well. So many plot twists, and so much creativity that you just wish other shows were just like this one. After you're done watching this, you'll be left wanting more. It's basically like drugs.<br/><br/>Overall, this show is what other shows strive to become. It excels in everything; the story, the characters, the depth, EVERYTHING. With this, I can proudly say that this is the best show AMC has ever had. Yes, it beats The Walking Dead, and yes it beats Mad Men. Breaking Bad<br/><br/>In my opinion, this is one of the best shows ever. The story it self is one off the best ridden scripts ever. It' so incredibly detailed. But not in annoying way,it certainly is not lengthy story or something like that. You constantly want to know what' going to happen in the next episode when you just finished one. It is highly addictive show. Ironic to be addicted to show that' about methamphetamine. It is very sensational show, from the beginning to the end. Even after it ends, you will still think about it. Even when you don' like the subject of the show, you will love this show. Bryan Cranston, is fantastic actor, one off the best there is in my opinion. He plays the main character so good that you almost forget it isn't real. You gotta watch this, for sure!! -I used to prefer Dexter, but the last seasons just sucked and made the show to be not perfect like Breaking Bad is. Breaking Bad's seasons are all good ones and it gets better and better and better and better and better. The cast is perfect. Just pick the perfect actors for the roles. Bryan Cranston it's the shoulder of all the show. He brings the tension, comedy and drama that makes Breaking Bad what it is. Walter White A.K.A Heisenberg is my favorite character of the show and maybe history of television. But it's not just Bryan also the other shoulder, Aaron Paul. The chemistry between them it's perfect like all in this show. Anna Gunn, Dean Norris, Betsy Brandt, RJ Mitte, Bob Odenkirk, Giancarlo Esposito, Jonathan Banks, just everybody in the show is perfect for the roles they play. Still thinking why Mad Men won over Breaking Bad 2 consecutive years for Drama Series. I mean Mad Men is good but far far far far far away from Breaking Bad. Now that have won 2 Golden Globes, I cannot wait for more awards. Specially the Emmys,yeah I think it will win all the Emmys in each Category. Bryan Cranston for Lead Actor, Aaron Paul for Supporting Actor, Anna Gunn for Supporting Actress, Drama Series and maybe Directing and Writing for its best episode 'Ozymandias' 5x14. Just love the Show and hope Bryan won his last Emmy in August. Perfect ending by the way, Bitch! First, I'd like to say this drama is one of the best I have seen recently. Part of the reason why this drama is so good is because it has challenged the conventional view of morality. Nobody is really "good" or "selfless" in this drama. What motivates them is always the instinct to survive and to live better, which seems realistic to me.<br/><br/>What I don't understand is why some people are shocked or angry that Walt has turned more and more "evil" throughout the drama. He started season 1 as a meth cook, which is already considered a "illegal" job by the society. In my opinion, whatever happened during later seasons just flowed naturally from this decision, whether it's killing, poisoning, fighting the gangs or deceiving his family. I mean once you enter the underworld, that's what will happen, otherwise you can't survive. <br/><br/>So if one accepted or even partly agreed with Walt's decision to be a meth cook in season 1, I don't see the reason why they wouldn't be able to accept what happened later. I think that's also one of the reasons why this show is so good, it really forces people to reflect on their own view of morality. When I watch this show I can't even believe what I am looking at. When it comes too Walt killing two drug dealers and poisoning a kid to save his own skin you still want to root for him. In the beginning he is just a simple guy then gets lung cancer and he is suddenly awake and turns into one of the most bad ass TV characters ever! Breaking bad I wish you were still on TV the most missed TV series. You know this show is was so good that the people of New Mexico have a funeral for Walter White and everyone in the city attends to it. The finale was so explosive I was at the edge of my seat the whole way through, the best TV show finale I have ever seen. The Best TV-Series there is and the best there ever Will be. Heisenberg 4ever. Too bad you can not assign note 100, and therefore assign the maximum possible, namely, note 10. Thank entire personnel that kept me breathless throughout the period of the five seasons. Maybe it should not continue with the other 5 seasons. Or who knows? Kudos too, to creator Vince Gilligan to have the courage to end the show at just the right time rather than string it out past where the story would bear. It may take a few episodes to get into, but you owe it to yourself to try. This is powerful, important and utterly enthralling stuff. But believe in one thing: this series can make us chase dreams that we would have not invested or may just be time well spent but it makes us realize that it is not necessary to be born in a slum to be a criminal. And do not say that it is something that is born with us: We can all Break Bad . Amazing.... It has a different plot after the end of the second season. But without spoiling it, this show begins with the tale of a man's needs making him desperate. It later focuses on ambition and a mans desire to rule and leave behind a statue for all to glorify. The paradox is, no matter how much the writers seemingly antagonize the main characters, the audience always cheers for the owners of drug cartels and murderers. Season two is conclusive and a cliff hanger at the same time. There are few television series like this. I have not enjoyed a show enough to tune in on since Seinfeld and Friends. You will love this so long you don't give up during the first few episodes before an actual plot develops. Hands-down the best acting I have ever seen in a TV drama series. Each actor and actress plays their role terrifically and really achieves exactly what the creators wanted each on of them to achieve. That is to make the viewers fall in love with the cast. The show also does an extremely stellar job in grabbing the viewers, pulling them in, and never, I say never letting them go! Closely, but better in my opinion, resembles The Walking Dead. I honestly cannot think of an episode that didn't end making me immediately want to jump into the next episode. In my opinion, that is exactly what a TV drama is supposed to do. Breaking Bad is dramatic, suspenseful perfection. 10/10! Breaking Bad has always been my favorite TV series but I never felt like writing a review about it or something, since many many people already said before me just what I wanted to say: it's without a doubt, the best TV series ever. That's something only a person who has followed plenty of TV shows in his own life could say, and I am that kind of person. I've seen The Sopranos, Dexter, The Walking Dead, Game Of Thrones, Twin Peaks and many other arguably defined "best TV shows ever", and Breaking Bad is definitely the best among them. The only one that's only SLIGHTLY inferior is HBO's best, Six Feet Under. Sure, I still have to try out shows like Mad Men and The Wire, but I doubt they could even go close to this AMC masterpiece. Breaking Bad is a perfect mix, since it has comedy, tragedy, action, horror and cop stuff, and no movie or show has ever integrated so many different genres in such a perfect way. Everything about it is excellent: the soundtrack, the directing, the montage, the metaphors, the little details, the acting, the writing, the twists... I never could describe it with words without missing important features it has, because it's a complete show, maybe the only one ever. 10/10 What can be said about this spectacular saga that hasn't been said before? One of the very few series that competes with the best films in history for achievement in cinematic storytelling. Like a great novel slowly unfolding, it's funny, heartbreaking, incredibly tense, deeply disturbing.<br/><br/>A nebbishy high-school science teacher finds he has lung cancer, so becomes a meth dealer to make money for his family before his death. Often visually stunning, with a breathtaking performance by Brian Cranston in the lead, and great work from all the supporting roles, this portrait of a man's decent into hell couldn't be much better, and it just grows darker and more disturbing each year.<br/><br/>In a way, thematically it recalls "The Godfather I and II" in how that epic charts Michael's journey from innocence to darkness, along with the moral murkiness of the endless drive for money and success - how we lose ourselves, so that succeeding and having ever more becomes an end in itself for which we will pay any price, rather than a route to happiness, trapping us in a game we can never win.<br/><br/>Kudos too, to creator Vince Gilligan to have the courage to end the show at just the right time rather than string it out past where the story would bear. It may take a few episodes to get into, but you oweit to yourself to try. This is powerful, important and utterly enthralling stuff. I hadn't heard of this TV show until pretty recently and have already finished it. It was an absolutely amazing show and its such a shame it ended, in fact I think it is the best TV show ever to have been made (and I consider myself a pretty harsh critic).<br/><br/>This show has is amazingly entertaining through the combination of a breath taking story with a sense of authenticity in all the little details to the major plot line, so all in all you will be simply astounded with the execution of such a eccentric chain of events that transpires through the entire show.<br/><br/>In one sentence Breaking Bad is why the television was invented, you simply cannot watch one episode without having that addictive sensation that forces you to sit for hours watching every episode in every season. Like i was watching an ancient Greek drama!! I want to express so many feelings that i have inside me,since i finished the series,but my English are awful!! When i finished the 1st season,i said ,OK,good,lets see the 2nd season,even if i don't understand all this noise for this series...When i finished the 2nd season,i said,OK a little bit better,but still...After the 3rd season,i was anxious to see the 4th,which was great!!When i was watching the 5th,especially the last 8 episodes,i was sad,because i knew that this masterpiece is going over!!And its over with the most wonderful finale!And then,all the pieces from every season,they took place in my mind!!Sad because its over...happy because i saw this perfection!! THANK you creators for this wonderful TV experience!! The summary says it all. This show is just too perfect to summarise. With the amazing acting, perfect cast and quite frankly epic moments this show truly lives up to the hype.<br/><br/>However, what really makes this show "click" is the realism it entails. It's been the strategy of most shows (dexter, suits etc) to simply use a character and throw them at us as whatever character they need to be at that time with no reasoning, e.g deb is angry because she's deb. This is something that Vince bypasses all together with his incredible use of character development, and example of which can be seen when we consider Walt and Jesse, Walt always described chemistry as "the study of change" and wow how they both change, with Walt's decent and Jesse's growth it's hard not to appreciate Vince's skill when it comes the character development which I believe simply makes the show shine. <br/><br/>P.S sorry for the Incompetence of this review. Obviously this is the first I've ever done and I need allot more practise... :P I am not exaggerating, this show will go down as one of the best shows ever. Try to point out a flaw? It has the best writing I have ever seen. It has amazing and interesting characters who you get connected to. I am very sad that there will never be another episode of this series. It is a gem. A show like this comes around only once in a lifetime. Don't miss out on this opportunity, watch this show! A show about meth? How do you like that? I wondered the same thing before I began to watch it. After a few episodes you will realize that it is much, more than that. Experience the "growth, decay, and transformation," of Walter White AKA Heisenberg. Witness the great tale about the family man chemistry teacher who broke bad! The age of Bryan Cranston has returned. Once universally lauded for his work in Malcolm In The Middle, there had yet to be a good vehicle for this man's particular talents. He has that rare gift of generating sympathy and manic-energy at the same time. For those that would be content to label this show a Weeds knock-off, bear in mind that Breaking Bad is a new kind of monster. It touches on the very same themes, "living realistically as a middle class in the United States" which often makes us resort to extremes to survive. Like the mother and daughter team that robbed that bank. But the weed selling antics of Showtime's hit show is really nothing like "Bad." The Pilot was about as perfect a Pilot as I've ever seen, and much of it rests on Bryan Cranston's shoulders. Cranston plays Cheimstry teacher Walter White. He has a loving wife, a child with Cerebal Palsy and another is on the way. He also happens to be dying from an inoperable lung cancer situation, which happened although he "never smoked." His finances in disarray, the once great student of science turns to crime to solve his problems. He cooks Crystal Meth with a good for nothing ex-student. From the antics of the first episode, the show is leading towards a dark place, but a place of truth. This is a no nonsense black comedy. For people that love Tarantino or the Coen's, this might be your cup of tea. Breaking Bad is quite possibly the most complete and gripping show I have ever seen in my life.<br/><br/>I had the opportunity to watch every episode on NetFlix and was completely blown away. The plot of the show centres around Walter White, a high school chemistry teacher who discovers he has cancer and the cost of the treatment, which may not necessarily work would leave his family in huge debt.<br/><br/>He teams up with an old student of his, Jesse Pinkman and begins to cook and deal Meth. The story moves on from there, with plenty of mishaps and adventures which I wont go into in much detail.<br/><br/>The way the story changes the main characters over the 5 seasons is extraordinary. Walt changes from a kind hearted, bumbling high school teacher to a cold, calculating, sinister individual. The change is remarkable and credit has to be given to the writers for the storyline.<br/><br/>All in all, an excellent show which justifies all the positive reviews it has received. <br/><br/>Usually once I finished watching a show from start to finish I find there to be very little reason to watch it again, however I will be making a rare exception for Breaking Bad! I'll tell you now, if you start with episode one, you won't be able to stop, it will just sink your whole day away. Absolutely amazing show, great acting and superb story. Prepare for a fantastic ride! I started watching the show when season 5 began. And within the start of season 5 episode one, I was caught up and watching episode five on TV. I was hooked from start to finish. The acting all the way through the show was great. Right up to the very end of the show I guarantee you will be craving more and more and never want it to end, but sadly, every show has to end at some point and instead of drawing it out and possibly making the story become boring and dull they finished it with an absolute perfect finale. Thank you so much Breaking Bad for giving me some great memories due to watching your show. I started watching BB marathon three weeks ago. Just finished it today. They couldn't have picked a better cast for this show. Brian Craston puts on a performance of a lifetime. And I couldn't picture anyone else playing the part. Every episode will leave you begging to watch the next one. The sad thing is its over and I'm still wishing there was another season. This is the first review i've ever felt compelled to write. The best thing is the series finale will leave nothing to the imagination. <br/><br/>For the foreseeable future my TV watching will be forever ruined due to the fact that I will compare every show I watch to BB.<br/><br/>RIP Breaking Bad.... and Hiesenberg <br/><br/>Good Luck to all the cast Thank You Gilligan for creating my mind the <br/><br/>"BEST SHOW EVER"<br/><br/>PS. Even Anthony Hopkins thinks it's the best acting he's EVER seen. And it only took him 2 weeks to watch 5 seasons.... Breaking Bad is one of the most acclaimed television series in recent history. Created by Vince Gilligan, this TV show won ten Primetime Emmy Awards, was ranked the 13th best-written TV series of all time by the Writers Guild of America, and in 2013 it was enlisted in the Guiness Book of World Records as the highest-rated TV series of all time.<br/><br/>I won't go into detail about the plot, since I think you are all familiar with the story of a talented, underachieving chemist who learns that he has inoperable lung cancer and decides to cook crystal meth to make money. Instead, I'll go straight to the point and try to say what makes Breaking Bad so good and acclaimed. But, what is left to be said about Breaking Bad that hasn't already been said a thousand times before? The series was amazingly well directed and edited, it was shot on beautiful locations and it featured a prime soundtrack. But the things that made me, personally, enjoy Breaking Bad as much as I did were the writing and the acting.<br/><br/>Surely, the best aspect of Breaking Bad is how fine it is written – the way it depicts a man 'breaking bad' so well, the audience can empathise with that man. I'd say the majority of people live every day like Walter White did, just waiting for a dramatic change in their lives, just waiting for their 'inner Heisenberg' to pop out. I'd say, every person is partly Walter White, partly Heisenberg, and that's why the audience could root for Heisenberg. Even when he did menacing and horrible things, the audience still rooted for him to succeed, because they partly rooted for 'their own Heisenberg' to succeed one day – if he did pop out one day. Vince Gillagan knows that neither the characters in the series, nor the audience watching the series are either white or schwarz – we are all grey (matter). By acknowledging and developing this moral relativity, Breaking Bad easily became one of the most praised TV-shows of all time.<br/><br/>But, of course, what's the point of a well written story and characters if there are no decent actors to back this up? Luckily, Breaking Bad has one of the bast cast ensembles I've seen in a television series in a long time. Bryan Cranston is magnificent when playing two different characters – Walter White and Heisenberg – and their variations. Aaron Paul is perfect as the troubled Jesse Pinkman, Anna Gunn is great as Skyler White, the character whom the audience loved to hate, but also the character without whom the show would be impossible to imagine. And then there are Dean Norris, Rj Mitte, Betsy Brandt, Bob Odenkirk and many more – all of whom did a terrific job. Breaking Bad truly is a show full of memorable characters that are backed up by immensely talented actors.<br/><br/>I wouldn't dare to go as far as to call Breaking Bad the best TV-show ever created, but one thing is certain: I enjoyed the hell of it and I'm looking forward to future projects from the people that made this masterpiece as good as it is. I thank all of you for the good time I had while watching this show! It was one fun ride that, unfortunately, had to end eventually, but I hope I'll see all of you soon in another project!<br/><br/>Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/ if TV is ever defined ,,it will be defined by breaking bad.. the most enigmatic,thrilling,and the most awesome thing ever to happen to TV is BREAKING BAD..TV will never be same after BREAKING BAD... it touches every human being and the way its being made ,written , acted , directed stands out miles from anything to happen on TV.....unmatched ....the journey of walter white and the way he pursues it and the great thing in the end he admits, that he loved to do this, summons it up.reflecting the very essence of human emotion that no work is done and then excelled unless you have passion for it, be it a BAD work ..and perfect way of saying every decision we make every choice we make we will eventually have a life based on that only..the genius of walter white has been kept in such way that u every time you get astonished by his acts but every time you believe in them...every character was made brilliantly and was put forth in perfect way ...it made every scene worth watching.. ..it made BAD be good...will miss it always I write this review with a heavy heart! Why? Breaking Bad comes to an end in two days! So what has Breaking Bad got to offer you? Five seasons of complete and utter brilliance that's what! Pre Breaking Bad I enjoyed American TV series such as Dexter, The Walking Dead, Supernatural, American Horror Story and True Blood. Breaking Bad to me (I thought) would not satisfy my love for crime/horror/blood and guts! How wrong was I?? Don't get my wrong I still love all the aforementioned TV shows but Breaking Bad is on a completely different level! The character development is fantastic: you literally go from loving Walt to hating his guts!! Then without warning you go back to the original feelings of warmth towards him (see penultimate episode of season 5) Enter the world of Breaking Bad knowing that once you've stepped in: you'll never EVER want to leave! All the characters are fantastic, from Walt, Jesse, Mike, Saul, Syler, Hank, Marie, Walt Junior, Gus I could go on and on and on!! They are all so bloody brilliant!! What a clever show! Your heart will race, you'll scream at the TV, you'll cover your eyes, your mouth will hang open in awe - there is no other show like Breaking Bad and I am so sad we have to say goodbye! I am on my THIRD viewing of the seasons now and I still love it as much as I did the first time!! Cranston and Paul thank you for your brilliance and continue with the good work. Two words WATCH IT!!! Growth. Decay. Transformation. This is the foundation on which the show built it's own empire. The tale of an ordinary man and his death sentence. From the beginning, it is clear that the protagonist you're watching won't have a happy ending. Viewers were just not sure how severe on the spectrum that judgment would fall. However, as much as the show is praised for it's unique story telling, characters, and acting, the real prize for fans is in the details. Breaking Bad's success is fueled by its re-watch-ability as viewers will continue to find countless connections and theories. Although most of these are a product of over analyzing, there is still enough to make you question legitimately whether these clues were on purpose. I give it a perfect score. There are hundreds of reviews that do the same. You have to agree with the rest of us, it just feels so good to be bad. Not only is this the greatest thing ever to be on TV screens, its a total game changer. Nobody else will get away with anything substandard anymore, after people have gotten a taste of the good stuff anything less will not satisfy them anymore, just like drug addicts. This show is 99% quality just like Heisenberg's meth. It is impossible to stay emotionally unattached after watching this show, and that's what makes this the greatest show of all time, how will Walt handle everything? The characters are very real and relatable and the acting is brilliant throughout. Breaking Bad is not as popular as the most popular TV shows, because it is just too good and too intelligent, it is ahead of its time but it has brought us to the future of quality TV, everything from this point on will be compared to the greatest TV show that has existed so far. Breaking Bad... <br/><br/>For me it sets the bar so high that no Game of thrones or dexter comes close to it, they may call there self the "competition" The bar is out of sight though. <br/><br/>Breaking bad runs through the life of Walter White and his "sidekick" Jesse Pinkman, it takes us through turmoil and trauma to get to our end which has to mines and many others opinions has been the best way to go out, not just a bang an ever lasting mark on television history. <br/><br/>For anyone who hasn't seen this go watch this. Give yourself an early gift and watch the best ever show broadcast on TV. this is best TV show series movie I ever seen now 30 years old and there a lot of good ones... but this one goes much much further it goes couple levels higher than best movies ever like godfather... or Scarface and pulp fiction and it makes it even more awesome because it is a series so it has much more depth... its just perfect...<br/><br/>it has little things in it in which mostly you can see only in TV movies... it has some great effects of an action movie it has humor on it it has CHANGE you can really feel the change and the characters... the story the mystery and all main characters even smaller roles play excellent and have an own influence and most important of all.. it is the play between character... that it goes for all of them...<br/><br/>its true that it has some similarity's with the weeds... in story... but the whole directing the whole tone is set totally different... that I cannot compare it... with as far as I know there are none or few series like this and that makes it even more awesome some people try to compare it with prison break... mad man and dexter but it has nothing in common not even the level breaking bad is far beyond those the only one which could come close is Oz from tom Fontana only those 2 has such depth that it comes close to reality and still every actor seems to be in main role .... There is actually no way of describing breaking bad other than saying that it is brilliant.This is the story of a chemistry genius turned high school teacher who was diagnosed with lung cancer.Now you can see the story is really deep.And it gets deeper because Walter White (the main character) becomes a drug dealer and partners up with another drug dealer his ex student Jesse Pinkman. Walt has a handicapped son a daughter in the way and his wife doesn't work. So clearly he needs the money.He is not a bad man he just makes bad decisions. But after a while Walt loses sight of whats really important and why really entered the business in the first place.Now as much as you can think there is nothing brilliant about this show , but you're really wrong,because the writers develop this story into one of the most complex storyline you have ever seen. Also what i mostly love about breaking bad is that there is no bad character in this show such as there is no bad actor.From Bryan Cranston(Walter white) to Aaron Paul (jesse pinkman) who made two of the best performances in TV history and making one on the best duos of all time.But not just them all actors even guest actors.And every time the season end with some spectacular event that leaves you really waiting the next season. So what i am trying to say is that although this may not be the most addictive show you have ever seen this is worth a try , and believe me will thank me later. I highly recommend that you watch this show. A fantastic drama series with touches of comedy. Bryan Cranston plays Chemistry teacher Walter White. He has a loving wife, a child with Cerebal Palsy and another is on the way. He also happens to be dying from an inoperable lung cancer situation, which happened although he "never smoked." His finances are in disarray, the once great student of science turns to crime to solve his problems. Walter suddenly has a revelation, thanks to an idea handed to him by his brother-in-law Hank played by Dean Norris, who works with the DEA - he decides to become a crystal meth dealer. This is really Bryan Cranston at his best & has rightly deserved all awards given to him for this character. All in all - Great cast, Great acting & Story lines are captivating. A MASTERPIECE! Cranston's incredible ability to convey frustration, desperation, (and a good few other '-tions' as well) can't help but lead to wonder whether this was a role that was specifically written for him - it's certainly hard to imagine anyone better suited to it. This then, really does become a roller-coaster journey with that lead character and everything that the choices he makes present to him.<br/><br/>With plenty of seat-edge moments crammed into each episode and just enough dry (occasionally dark) humour to take the edge off, Breaking Bad is somewhat of a gem. It's hard not to feel perhaps a little exhausted at the end of each episode (which seem to end as quickly as they start), but with an overwhelming urge to start the next one straight away. Trust me when I say, with 5 seasons to watch you could very easily lose a week or two in one go. Cranston's portrayal of a man who never knew how to live until his diagnosis of cancer, was not only worthy of an Emmy award, but in fact a sure winner as he won it for best actor, for his transformation of a goofy dad from "Malcolm in the Middle" to a hard core drug dealer in "Breaking Bad". Breaking Bad truly demonstrates how far a man will go for the well being for his family, as he goes through a life changing transformation. Vince Gilligan has managed to produce a very simple storyline yet very effective in both action and drama, as he presents a man near death and running out of options the only thing left to do, "Break Bad". Cranston's not the only star in the show there's also Aaron Paul who has not only won one, but two Emmy award for outstanding acting for his portrayal of young adult gone down the wrong road, is absolutely fabulous as it reflects to real life of many people who have gone down the same path, making the show more intense, Breaking bad was nominated for cinematography, as its season 4 demonstrated the power of special effects. The opener starts off with a great scene of two planes crashing into each other, which is masterfully crafted as not only did it look realistic but also tired in greatly with the storyline as it shows how destructive Walters(Bryan Cranston) life has become. Great cinematography is once again shown in the equally brilliant season 5. Walter (Bryan Cranston) demand the murder of 8 people, yes it may seem a bit harsh calling a murder great thing but with the help of Gilligan's great directing skills they are all shown in an impressive montage of flashes where we see each prisoner being killed in different ways. As I said before murder is harsh, but with the help of music it s and looks like a piece of artwork. In many shows music is mainly used to represent certain emotions for characters, however in breaking bad it is used to create a surprising sense of humor every time when we see the duo "cooking a batch", by doing so it make something so dangerous such as making drugs seem almost fun and harmless, as such jolly music accompanies it. Breaking bad is not all about action as hard as it sound, in fact it can be quiet poetic as each character is represented by the colors of there clothing for instance in the beginning of the series we see Walter wherein grey to represent the dullness in his life but as the show progressed it soon changed to black and blue which highlight the dangers in life as well as the excitement. Overall I believe that there is a lot of potential left for the shows which we will hopefully see in 2013 where it will continue the legacy of it presodecer seasons or hopefully surpass them in excitement and drama. If anyone was to ask me for a TV show, the first thing I will say is breaking bad. I think Breaking Bad is one of the best shows in the recent years that reflected the ever lasting conflict between good and evil. Highly presented to the audience; screenplay, story facts, acting crew and directing. All aspects of this work have always proved being on top of everything else that's being played as these episodes keep you excited with curiosity every time one of them is on! Simply amazing...! In relation with violence as a factor that keeps growing bigger in each episode, where comes the smartness of this work, you find yourself supportive to such acts as a point of sympathy with the characters, where - at the end - are pure criminal acts! This work puts you in real conflict with yourself, sometimes, as you keep trying to understand the necessity to survive by practicing all morally wrong things you've ever known in your life! This show starts off slow-fast and then starts to get crazy never in my life seen a show take of like this! this show deserves every award for everything it dishes out, you just don't know how crazy it can go until the unexpected happens. If some how? they killed off the head actors at the end of the show for a reason so they can keep doing what they are doing but made it in a 2hr movie and started it off with faking there deaths? and some how did it! would be a #1 movie to go see, I've seen this show yrs ago but never started watching it because just didn't have the time and thought it was just another show that wont last long but! i was wrong in every way and cant wait until i start watching season 4 tomorrow, please don't let the first season disappoint you and think its a nothing show because its far from that, this show has to fit into your personality in some way. GOOD LUCK I have always been more of a movie fan than a TV series fan but recently there have been a number of television productions which have changed my opinion. Breaking Bad has been one such show. Gripping, intense and 100% believable- the series tells the tale of a high school chemistry teacher who turns to cooking crystal meth with a former student in order to provide for his family knowing that his life is due to be cut short as he is diagnosed with lung cancer. Bryan Cranston is truly amazing as the protagonist- initially an amiable, family orientated character, the story displays his change in personality- quickly becoming the most important asset in the meth trade. Cranston is the star of the show but he is supported by a superb cast. Fully deserved of all the accolades, awards and critical acclaim, this series will suck you in and spit you out. I don't want to spoil the story line so I will simply recommend that you watch it. Not to sound clichéd but this is truly ground breaking viewing. The direction and storyline makes you empathise and sympathise with the wonderful characters. Truly magnificent. This is the best show on television. Nowadays the shows that are so- called "main-stream" overrun the channels, but there are a few that detach from that group. And in that group there is that 1 show, the show that leaves you aching for the next season premiere, the show that overshadows all the others. That show is Breaking Bad.<br/><br/>This is by-far the best television program I have ever watched. It has that older Tarantino-Scorsese style and flow to it. Like the Pulp Fiction Tarantino and the Goodfellas Scorsese. In order to prove how exhilarating this show is I have to compare to the ELITE writers and directors in cinema. I can't just say that Vince Gilligan made a show I have to say that he made THE show. THE show that movie-lovers adore and can't wait for to air.<br/><br/>GIVE THE SHOW A CHANCE. I know many people that say this, "I don't condemn a teacher selling meth". Walter White isn't involved with drugs to sniff and puff. He is involved in order to support his family after he dies because he is diagnosed with lung cancer. So go on NETFLIX and watch the first 4 seasons of the show. It will be worth your while. The last season had just a teeny bit of drag for me, but I got over it. The new season starts next week and I cannot wait! It is the best show on TV for so many reasons. The writing is pure genius and the acting is perfection right down to the smallest roles. Anyone who has not watched this series from the very first episode cannot understand the hoopla. I've tried to explain it to friends and family, but no one understands until they watch that first season and get hooked. Breaking Bad is, like its own reason for existence, a drug. Oh, tried to post and I didn't write the minimum of ten. So...Way down upon the Swanee River, far, far away...now I have. LOL! I love this series and it is true to it is title. It is about a good man that breaking bad by just trying to be helping his family. It does make you see that breaking bad is one step at a time thing and sometimes it may start with good intentions.<br/><br/>I must say that I have been watching the recorded version of the show for the most part and that I had to fast-forward over some gruesome parts in order to enable myself to follow it after avoiding for a long time.<br/><br/>The acting is superb. The plots are highly inventive. The dialog is well written.<br/><br/>I don't think that it could have been done any better this.<br/><br/>What I find that is hard to believe, is that I am watching it. Only this year after watching this series I have been able to watch gruesome crime shows which I have avoided most of my life.<br/><br/>Now I am catching up on TV crime shows and having watched a few, this is the best one of the lot and highly unique. I have been forced to write this review after watching 2 seasons of Breaking Bad. This is one of the best series I have seen. EVER. Bryan Cranston is BAD ASS and his acting is one to be remembered. It is such a different character compared to his role in 'Malcom in the Middle'.<br/><br/>For those of you who enjoy watching action combined with drama and subtle humour, this is for you. This series may start out a little slow to the average viewers but once you get hooked, its hard to take your eyes off it. Everything is so unexpected and well planned and each episode begins from exactly where the previous episode left off. <br/><br/>The acting is pretty good. One of the best part about Breaking Bad is the chemistry between Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul. I love the attention to detail. Watch the series and you will know. The appearance of the characters that changes with time and such. <br/><br/>Ps : Breaking Bad is dark and it kicks ass ! THUMBS UP ! If I like a show I'll watch 2 or 3 episodes on the spin. With this I somehow have gone through 3 full series in three days! I had work the next morning and my wife had to call me to bed at 2.00am. I didn't realise how long I had been watching it.<br/><br/>The acting is brilliant, the way the show 'teases' you with images you just know are going to make sense sometime is brilliant.<br/><br/>The humour is very dark in the early seasons and it is a thriller first and foremost, but you will laugh out loud on occasion.<br/><br/>As a Brit I have to say some of the US series are very overrated but this one isn't.<br/><br/>The best thing about BB is that it's completely unpredictable. As soon as you try and second guess it, it takes you somewhere else. To an even better place. Something only brilliant writing can do.<br/><br/>The finale of Season 4 almost made me cry. Not because it was particularly sad in any way...but because it was so brilliant. I think I was a bit sad as I knew I would probably never see something so good again.<br/><br/>The good news is Season 5 (the final season) is outstanding too (at the 7th episode point).<br/><br/>Get yourself the complete set and sit down and prepare to curse eating, bowel movements and sleeping as they stop you on your BB marathon.<br/><br/>If I could have my memory erased I would remove BB from my mind so I could start again.<br/><br/>I am so jealous of you if you are about to start watching Season 1 for the first time. I have to share with you that this series is one of the most refreshingly unique and innovative ideas I have ever seen expressed in a TV drama. Walt, who is a chemistry teacher has just been diagnosed with terminal cancer. He has to make sure he provides for his family including his pregnant wife Skyler and his son who has a disability. He decides to start making crystal meth with his accomplice, a former student called Jesse. The comedy is so dark, with each episode as Walt and Jess venture further and further into the scary world of illegal drugs the audience is left thinking, 'oh please don't do that - please don't do that!' and then they do. The series is not for the squeamish however, I agree with many others, it's just about the best thing that's been on TV, I am a huge fan and have just purchased series 2. I just finished watching all 4 seasons in just under 3 days. I was totally addicted at first, somewhat lost my enthusiasm during the 3rd season, and regained it with the fabulous 4th season.<br/><br/>The writing is of the highest quality and the acting is exceptional. Bryan Cranston(Walter) and Anna Gunn(Skyler) are amazing. A special mention to Giancarlo Esposito(Gus) for one of the creepiest TV character ever.<br/><br/>It's nice that there is a main storyline linking all the seasons together. The main quest remains the same, and all the subplots revolve around it. Something Tim Kring was not able to do with Heroes for example.<br/><br/>The only critics I have (and it is the only one really, otherwise I would rate it 10/10) is that I found some of Walter's decisions rather foolish and hard to justify. Also, in a few episodes, montage was weak and didn't contribute to a satisfying pace.<br/><br/>I am now hooked on this series and can't wait to get my next fix in 2012 with season 5. I like to look at the pace of this show as that of life itself. It's hard (as I've read by other reviewers) for most to like Jesse as a character; Jesse honestly is just that type of character. I recommend you don't judge him, and accept that the character development will fill in the blanks, as does the acting. Take it or leave it, this show is "arts" in all meaning of the word. It's an amazing show and it has my recommendation for any who are interested! It is very intense, and it's moral issue scenarios are very unique, and very realistic. <br/><br/>For these facts, this show is set apart from any other I've seen. The newer shows like Miami Vice and Ncis: LA fall so very short to the cinematography and complexity of this wonderful piece of television (or to put it in my opinion, a long, extenuated silver screen movie, mainly due to the acting). Give it a try, you'll never regret it!<br/><br/>Easily a 10 star review! Two thumbs way, way up! **********! I just finished the series so now I'm waiting for season 4, but let me tell you Bryan Cranston is one hell of an actor, from playing an over-stressed and over-worked comedic father in Malcolm in the Middle, to a serious dramatic bad a** father and a Methamphetamine cooker. Not only is he phenomenal, but Aaron Paul definitely deserves an Emmy for season 3, I'll poop my pants if he doesn't win.<br/><br/>The main plot of the show is Walter White (Bryan Cranston) is a High School Chemistry teacher that is diagnosed with cancer. He and his family are already middle class and paying for Chemo-therapy is expensive, so he hooks up with a former student (Aaron Paul) and starts to cook Methamphetamine, and he can do it perfectly since he respects the chemistry. And from there it just gets better and better.<br/><br/>One thing I love about this show is not only the incredible acting and writing, but the character development. I don't think I've seen a show that focused this much on the dynamics of characters, which more shows should do. You'll see Bryan Cranston go from an average father and teacher to a stone cold bad a** in the blink of an eye. Also Aaron Paul in season 3 blew my mind, he is emotional, intense, and comedic all at once. This show deserves a perfect 10. Although Bryan Cranston has won the Best Actor Emmy now two years in a row, I think people are still really slow to catch on to "Breaking Bad". Perhaps it's because it's on Showtime and not accessible to all, perhaps it's the premise which, if like "Dexter" is explained in one or two sentences, might seem off-putting -- I don't know. But I'm so glad a friend of ours mentioned it to us a year or so ago, and we immediately NetFlixed to catch up so that we can be watching this season as it unwinds.<br/><br/>I love everything about this show -- the acting, writing, directing -- and I have to put it up there with other great shows like "The Sopranos" and "Dexter" that find a way to skillfully inject humor into the most seemingly horrible/terrifying/grim situations. We have since turned several people onto this show, but my husband's best friend still isn't budging -- he insists he finds the premise too "depressing" and just won't give it a chance. Too bad -- he's missing a real gem. Okay it's good but it's overrated ! It does not deserve 9.5 /10 ... There a plenty of shows better than this !
Completely overrated A more detailed end could be better than this. Left me with a feeling of frustration about Jessie's life, what happens with Walter junior, did he ever get his money or not!? What about Skyler and little Holy? Did she ever knows who her father was? Anyway some "years ago" details would be nice and i would prefer the end to be somehow brighter..like showing some kind of sweet memories Walter had with his family as he uses his own blue sky. Anyway that's all. If you have much of free time and you like stories with drugs, gunshots and things like that..watch this, otherwise...i really don't get this 9,5. Mr.White and his complicated personality it's interesting though, from a psychological point of view. Breaking bad is a good show but fails to achieve greatness on multiple levels due to a combination of bad acting, unrealistic writing and lack of grit.<br/><br/>Brysan Cranston plays Walter White who is terminally ill high school chemistry teacher who decides to leave his family with a substantial sum of money to support them in the future by cooking meth. There is no denying that Cranston is fine actor but the supporting cast and where the show gets let down the most. <br/><br/>The supporting characters do not come across as believable either with their dialogue or actions and sadly their acting is less than desirable. Like so many before it the show strives to show "true" grit but fails like so many American shows, I don't know whether it is the lighting or make up but everything is too shiny and clean and this is a common problem with American shows compared to British shows, which do often capture the rough and crude far better.<br/><br/>Breaking bad is good show but nothing special but worth a watch is nothing else is on. "Tread Carefully" as the last episode was called (Season 5 Episode 09) Was probably the worst episode that could be created, I'm not sure what the director was thinking? Maybe he wanted to give us a nightmare of an episode and then blow our minds on the next. Anyhow, He downgraded my love for the show from 10 to a stable 7 with just 1 episode. There is not much I could tell you about this episode other than it was awful, Right down the drain, 50 minutes of regret, I'm lying now in my bed, feeling lonely and frustrated of how just one episode could downgrade your favorite show from number 1 to a probable number 10-15. Sincerely yours, Rémy What exactly is wrong with Breaking Bad? I am not entirely sure. I do feel that I should like the show a lot, it is a good piece of quality television, and yet I'm not feeling it. Maybe it is because of the very slow pace. Something I am normally not at all opposed to, but this is too much. Often I am busy doing other things for 10-15 minutes, and when I return to the series I haven't missed anything important. Maybe it is because none of the characters are in any way likable. Walter is jumping back and forth between a pathetic failure and an emotionless hard-ass drug-lord; Jesse is a pushover who messes up everything he does; Hank is a violent simpleton; Marie is a whiny bitch; Walt Jr. is a superficial cookie-cutter "coming of age sick kid"; and Skyler must be one of the most obnoxious characters ever seen on television. Maybe it is because of the overall atmosphere of depression and hopelessness. All of the characters' lives are messed up in every possible way, and they all are all lonely, miserable, unfulfilled and doomed to fail. Altogether, this show unfortunately fails to have a grip on me, which is a pity as it is altogether well written and well acted. The creativity of this series can not get better. To me it is like a Twin Peaks in it's complex nature of human psychology, but with a vastly different theme and mood. I like to watch it at night, when no one is around. I hate drugs, and most of Hollywood's products, but this show stands alone, great, gritty as it gets, unique, and poetic. A great job at plot tie ins', surreal moments, dark side of human nature, imagery. I feel dirty watching the shows at times, but a dirty I like, a dirty we all have in us but suppress, a dirty that howls at the moon and sometimes, cautiously, needs to be expressed. <br/><br/>-Cal_Ford @ hotmail .com Exective summary: Breaking Bad is mildly entertaining.<br/><br/>As someone told me, Breaking Bad is a TV show that would be impossible to stage in Europe. Why? Because the main protagonist would have medical insurance which would cover at least a part of the cost for his treatment.<br/><br/>Apart from this joke, Breaking Bad was vaguely interesting show to me. In a way it was similar to Boardwalk Empire, another acclaimed show that didn't fulfill the expectations and left me mildly satisfied.<br/><br/>What Breaking Bad did well to a certain extent was to show main protagonists's struggle to survive in a new and hostile environment.<br/><br/>On the other hand, all characters were too artificial for my taste, almost like the synthetic drugs produced by Heisenberg. But i guess this was the writers' attempt to portrait "ordinary people" in the US. The whole show presented Walt as a character who was slowly becoming a sociopathic, ruthless, mastermind manipulator whom not even the greatest drug lord of all time could defeat (Gus). However, this episode shows Walt be absolutely annihilated by a group of careless dimwits lead by the uncle of a VERY simple Todd who was that low in life, his job was an exterminator.<br/><br/>I feel like the defeat of Walt (by killing Hank) should have been done by someone of much more power than the uncles of a simple boy. These people were nowhere the level which should have been required to defeat Walt and this just completely ruined the show for me. Bad episode that shouldn't have made it into the show. Anyone who watches a dramatic TV show series 7 times clearly has no life. Reading things like 'the show changed my life' and other nonsense validates what I already know- that I am not a couch potato. Yes, Cranston is a great character actor and the show is well cast for the most part, but it was also very cheesy in parts- yes, I said cheesy- so much so that I found myself skipping a lot of scenes that just didn't add anything. LOST is a much better show in my opinion- more original for sure, and worthy of the title in TV that it has- as being one of the greatest TV shows ever made. Breaking Bad is decent, but if it was so unblieveably good, I wouldn't have dozed off and missed at least 10-15 episodes of which I have no desire to go back and watch. I guess the creators of this tv series just wanted to tell us that we shouldn't be involved in any crime activities by showing ridiculously stupid ending of the series where all of a sudden everything goes wrong for the main character.
I was going to rate it 10 stars before I had seen the ending. Breaking Bad is one of those shows that is probably going to divide viewers. Those with strong views against drug consumption, production and sale will not be happy with this show. That would be, however, missing the point somewhat. <br/><br/>Although the main character decides to supplement his income as a high school teacher by producing drugs, this is by all means not an easy journey. The gains are few and far between and the downside of the business, that is the violence and human destruction that come with it, far from glamorise the subject. <br/><br/>The series can be extremely disturbing and, at the same time, extremely funny. The humour is usually dark and will therefore not be to everyone's taste but it is very well achieved in the series. This is more obvious in season 1 rather than on season 2, which grew darker and left me feeling uneasy at the end of each episode. This is a very violent show, both in terms of physical violence, with the usual shootings and general gore that are so prominent on a number of recent television series, but also in terms of human suffering and interaction, as is visible in the depiction of drug addicts.<br/><br/>The characters are generally solid and have enough depth to surprise the viewer. They are not all lovable; some are in fact rather annoying but this does not mean that they are superfluous. The story is good and keeps moving forward at good pace.<br/><br/>As already mentioned, there seems to be a turn to the darker side in season 2. This may tip the balance of the series too much to make it as enjoyable as before, but still makes pretty good viewing. Everyone says how good this is but I thought it was drivel , I don't take drugs so that's maybe why I didn't like it , poor scripts,rubbish acting ,waste of time Definitely good but not the best for me. I can see getting a more realistic perspective on topics like that was something innovative at the time but watching it for the first time in 2020 honestly felt kinda boring and slow. Maybe my expectations were too high considering the huge hype around this show. Great characters and a great script, if it wasn't so needlessly long. This series could have been reduced by about 50% and been an amazing action packed show. I get it, people love it. For me, it took about one and a half seasons to start getting interesting, kept me relatively engaged until a couple episodes into season 5 - after that, I was ready for it to be over. There are some great scenes all throughout, including season 5, but lordy, it's slow. By the time I started watching this show, it's been a year already since it's end. The show was very praised and called the greatest show of all time by many. I didn't binge-watch since while the show is very good, it wasn't that addicting for me. Anyways, I'll now start reviewing the show season by season.<br/><br/>Season 1 - It's not bad, but it's all a set up really and it has only 7 episodes, so when I finished this season, I was like:"So this is really the greatest show of all time?". Pilot episode was great and promising, but then the middle of the season was kinda dragging. There was some great acting, of course but it's all very small compared to the rest of the series. Then episode 6 came and I was amazed and I was expecting a lot from the finale, but it felt really anti- climatic. It was better than episodes 2-5, but it still wasn't anything special like episodes 1 and 6. See, the thing with Breaking Bad is that sometimes it may seem really slow and even pretty boring at times, but when it gets good, then it's DAMN AWESOME! And that was pretty clear even here, but this season is still a huge disappointment and the worst of the show. 6/10<br/><br/>Season 2 - A huge improvement over Season 1. We get to know more about the characters and their problems, it's pretty intense at times, some people call this season boring too, but it wasn't really boring to me. It started off pretty intense and episode 2 was extremely intense. After that, it gets a bit slower again, but there is a stand-alone episode which is an absolute perfection. It's episode 6 and it's called Peekaboo. After that, it's not boring at all, at least not for me and by the end of the season is where Walter's breaking bad really starts. And he's not the only one who is breaking bad here. It also affects some other characters and changes them in later seasons. And the finale is much more fitting here and has quite a cliffhanger. 9/10<br/><br/>Season 3 - This season was pretty good, but for me it's kind of a let down after Season 2 that very pleasantly surprised me. It's really slow for the first 5 episodes, but then episodes 6-8 make up for it, especially episode 7. The next episodes are also very good, but it feels like some of them are only appreciated for their climax. And the same case is with me because not really much happens during an episode, but then there comes a terrific ending, I'm talking mostly about the last 2 episodes of the season. And some people may call episode 10, "Fly", just a pointless filler, but I really enjoyed it. The whole episode was stand-alone and didn't have much to do with the main plot, but for me it was well worth a watch. So, at the end, I can say that this season is pretty decent, but not as good as Season 2. 8/10<br/><br/>Season 4 - OK, that was amazing. In my opinion the best season of the show. It may have a slow start, and even middle, but it's not as slow as it can be and it's enough to keep you interested. But the last 4 episodes, oh boy! That's the most intense thing I've ever seen. Especially the end of episode 11, "Crawl Space". I've never been so scared in my entire life. Just the way the last scene is shot is brilliant, and the soundtrack and Bryan Cranston's acting makes it all even better. I literally got a panic attack and I could feel my heart beating in my chest like it's going to burst out. Just incredible! And the last two episodes were almost as incredible as this one. This season may have a slow start, and maybe even middle, but the last 4 episodes make up for it all. 10/10<br/><br/>Season 5 - The one that ends it all. By now, Walt completely broke bad and this season gibes you such a mix of emotions. One more thing about this show is that you can't simply have a favorite character here. They all have a good side, but they are all really flawed. After all, they are just ordinary people and that's the main reason this show feels so realistic. You don't know how to feel about some characters and one moment you can't stand them, but the other you completely feel for them. Or vice versa. In this season, that happened to me with literally half of the characters. This season has only a few boring episodes and there is always something interesting happening in each episode, at least a small part. And I appreciated Aaron Paul before, but he truly amazed me in this season. He should be in more good movies, because that way he could get an Oscar one day! And I don't even need to say anything about Bryan Cranston. He's fascinating. This season was very dramatic and tragic at times and when it ends, you just can't believe it's over even tho it's all tied very well. And while this season was very good, I still appreciate the suspense of Season 4 a bit more so that one remains my favorite. 9/10<br/><br/>I'm so sorry to say this, but while this show is very good, it might be just one tiny bit overrated. Please don't kill me. But I still think everyone should watch it because some moments in this show are better than some of the greatest movie scenes. But it felt like it lacks substance at some parts, so I'm not giving it a 10. It's the best! I really liked it from the beginning but the end is amazing. Everyone should watch BB and i also thing many things in BB is how it could work with things like this so I would say it's realistic as well. I would say without spoiling anything that I change my minds about how I would end in every season. But I think one of the reasons I like it so much is how it ends. It has a good ending part. If a take Prison Break for an example I didn't like the end of it because it's not how it should end but BB isn't how it should end as well but it's still a really good end because it has to end sometimes or it just going to be a bad end anyway. I put off watching this for a long time as it sounded like it would be quite depressing. I am therefore surprised to find that it is actually quite good.<br/><br/>Only criticisms I would have is that it moves incredibly slowly at times and is frustrating as a result. Also the female characters in this show are unbelievably infuriating to watch. Like someone distilled the essence right out of a screeching cat, added in some dragon's blood and then mixed it all up into two loud, single-minded vaguely human shaped monsters with all the personality and charisma of shop mannequins.<br/><br/>I know that is sort of the point but I honestly cannot understand how any man in his right mind could be in a marriage with someone like either of them without going totally off the rails long before the cancer or drugs. If ever there was a programme to put someone off marriage this is it.<br/><br/>It is truly painful to watch them at times. I also get driven far beyond frustration at that whole 'get help' attitude. Said screeching-cat-dragon-blooded-mannequin-woman dives headfirst into everything without ever just using her own brain. The moment she finds out her husband has cancer she reads material on it obsessively whilst lying to herself. Then she goes all out convincing her husband to go through a painful treatment process which is unlikely to help and will only serve to make what life he has left horrific. Then she is moaning about him acting up in a group therapy session? She is one of the most annoying characters I have ever encountered on TV and I think the over the top nature of her is only partially intended as such. People being given 'interventions' rather than just being allowed to make their own damn mind up seems like an accepted part of American culture. It's just people who claim to have the best interests of their loved ones in mind whilst in fact all they are saying is 'fit in with our perfect utopian society which we are too blind to see any problems with'.<br/><br/>That kind of pseudo-psychiatric nonsense just seems to plague American culture though and I am unclear if it is simply a part of the story or if the writers were intentionally trying to poke fun at how stupid it all is like I am. Frankly I have similar issues with a lot of TV shows though and I can scarcely think of a family drama or sitcom where the wife isn't a total power hungry monster in a dress who wears her husband's testicles like a necklace.<br/><br/>Besides that however the programme has some good messages on serious social issues such as drugs, cancer and the horrifically unfair state of American healthcare. This is delivered through a pretty unyielding and hard-hitting plot. Just a shame about the dragons. It is the best TV-series I have ever seen. The performance of the cast and the direction is just so amazing that u will never know what to expect. The jokes are funny. Over all The series is very entertaining and you cannot stay without talking about it. It keeps you guessing till the end and most of the people including me didn't know what would come.<br/><br/>I loved this series the first time I watched it, now i've seen it more than 3 times and i still love it and want to watch it. The music was also good and the acting was the best. A must watch series!!!!<br/><br/>i m eagerly waiting for fresh episodes, yet to release in march 2013 i feel very bad when i can not get this series very easily in India.. but after all i feel very happy to enjoy show. A brilliant show. Enjoyed a lot, some episodes were just off the hook while others were worthy of watching, to say the very least. Don't get me wrong, it's one of my favorite shows but I am not so sure if I agree with the fact that it is the best show ever made though. <br/><br/>Excellent character development but it had clichés and tbh I expected more considering it's reviews and ratings. Crawl Space was probably one of the best scenes in any TV Series. The way Gus died, the way Hank died and the way Steve Gomez died were just disappointing they failed to make them dramatic enough plus the way Jesse found Walt poisoned that kid and the way hank found about Walt was just too convenient. <br/><br/>I think the last 3 episodes could've been better, they just didn't had enough in them. Most of BB viewers haven't watched, GOT, Hannibal, The Sopranos, Prison Break, Sherlock, The Wire and plenty other series, that's why it's easy for them to deduce it's the greatest show of all time. Being a personal favorite show is one thing, deeming it as the best show ever is another. <br/><br/>How is this the best written show? Jesse and Walt's domestic fights over and over again were just annoying, Walt lying to and concealing information from Skyler, wouldn't it be more convenient to explain than to lie, She would've found out eventually. Hank was supposed to be bad ass and had great sense of humor, seeing a person get his head on a turtle and people he barely knew were killed, suddenly he couldn't get out of his bed. Screenplay had nothing special. <br/><br/>Gus and Saul were the best characters for me. I'm not sure if I can watched this again, except for few episodes. I pushed myself to watch all seasons but it's so bad, yet final episode
And I noticed some mistake like a mic is seen in the first episode
#breaking_bad is so bad, don't waist your time If Game of Thrones has the same rating as Breaking Bad there is something seriously wrong. This shows isn't bad by no means. It was actually very good. An honest ranking would be somewhere in the high 8s. Perhaps an 8.7. And this doesn't have anything to do with personal taste or the genre. I've seen this show all the way through twice. I'm am comparing only the story telling and character building. Which I feel is no where near on par with GoT. So this is one of the worst TV shows I have EVER watched. The plot is pretty stupid, like why the hell would you cook meth for money for your cancer. Like you can do a fundraiser or walt could have got money from gretchen and elliot when he was offered and the treatments would have been taken care of. Not only does the plot make absolutely NO sensex its very very boring. Like I littlerly fell asleep watching it. Most of the time its showing stuff that is not related to the trash plot. The ONLY good thing about this show is the acting,Bryan Cranston,Arron Paul and Anna Gun did an outstanding job. Other than that the show is complete trash and I have no idea how people think this is the best show. ITS LITTERLY TRASHH!!! The first 3 seasons complete boring trash. The 4th and 5th are ok but overall very overrated and boring show Everyone I know loved this show. Everyone said that it's "really, really good". I cannot disagree more. It's not the worst TV show that I've ever seen, but it's quite down there with the rest of the garbage. I mean, it's watchable but only on fast forward most of the time. One of the insane wives on the screen? Fast forward. Jesse Pinkman is having a nervous breakdown again (for no good reason)? Fast forward. Walter is trying to save Jesse from who knows what and for what reason again and again? Fast forward. Jesse is saying the "B" word again or they all say "cook" again and again? Mute and fast-forward. Why the airliner crash was needed? Why the teddy bear eye was there? Why Hank had his panic attacks (or were they heart attacks)? And plenty more... No answers, big mystery. And what about his illness? I thought they'd mention it once in the beginning and that will be the end of it. Fine, we get it, that's the reason he's doing it. Stop reminding us of it again and again and again! Nothing made sense in this show. Absolutely nothing. Horrible writing. Horrible acting (but it's the writers' and the directors' fault, not the actors). Saul was the only character who was OK, but only in the beginning. They quickly ran out of ideas about what to do with this character too. I hated this show and I will never ever watch it again. And I agree with others that it was depressing because of it's absolute stupidity. After all the reviews and high ratings I was expecting a show that is better than "The Wire". This is an intense, back and forth drama that includes 10-15 people. An intriguing story of secrets, criminal conspiracies and betrayal. Not much more in this show.
On the other hand, "The Wire" is a show that explains the inner workings of modern fascism in which we now live. How criminals, lawyers, politicians and businessman all cooperate to form a unified plutocratic elite that makes all the young people say: "The game is rigged!" Now THAT is a masterpiece, not Breaking Bad. It's just bad, unrealistic, based on lucky "heroes" in lucky situations (too lucky). lack of imagination, no brain (except for chemical formulas) it's a fantastic script. Nobody can survive in a world of drug traffickers like these "heroes". No one in the world of drug traffickers is so lucky. it's a deadly affair. If you want to make an interesting show, give it a touch of reality (at least a little). I'm usually a big fan of crime/drama series, but this one over here drains your soul alive. I actually watched it all the way till the end to see if it gets any better, but it was just below my expectations Many people and sources were telling me that this was one of the greatest shows on TV, so I was getting frustrated that I had not seen it, but I finally decided to give it a go when I had plenty of time to watch, I am so happy I did, created by Vince Gilligan. Basically the show sees the story of high school chemistry teacher Walter "Walt" White (Golden Globe winning and three-time nominated, and four-time Emmy winning and twice nominated Bryan Cranston, also producing, and directing some episodes), he is diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer, and he wants to make sure his family is financially supported after he dies. Therefore, with former student Jesse Pinkman (Golden Globe nominated, and three-time Emmy winning and twice nominated Aaron Paul), having seen the opportunity to make thousands of dollars from it, Walter with his chemistry knowledge manages to cook a perfect batch of crystallised methamphetamine, coloured blue, so he produces it and Jesse finds methods to sell it. They start independently, cooking in an RV, selling to psychopathic Mexican drug kingpin Tuco Salamanca (Raymond Cruz), with Walter using the alias "Heisenberg", but he becomes too dangerous to do business with, so they find a way to dispose of him and move on. Walter and Jesse settle on business with Gustavo 'Gus' Fring (Emmy nominated Giancarlo Esposito), a respected man who owns many businesses, including fast food restaurant chain Los Pollos Hermanos (Spanish for "The Chicken Brothers"), he uses his businesses to secretly distribute crystal meth across America, he gives the pair their own lab, hidden beneath his laundry business. Walter tries to balance his life of crime while continuing to maintain his family life, with wife Skyler (twice Emmy winning and nominated Anna Gunn), who eventually finds out, but helps to hide the money and all from teenage cerebral palsy suffering son Walter "Flynn" White, Jr. (RJ Mitte) and the rest of the family. Meanwhile, Walter's brother-in- law Hank Schrader (Under the Dome's Dean Norris) is a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent trying the stop the selling and distributions of drugs across America, especially crystal meth, following the many clues he finds to find "Heisenberg", he is completely unaware (until near the end) that his own brother-in-law is responsible. To make certain that business continues to grow, and the DEA and other authorities do not discover Walter, Jesse and all others involved, Walter hires lawyer Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk) as their accomplice, he has connections to "fixers", and they also have his private investigator Mike Ehrmantraut (Emmy nominated Jonathan Banks), who also works for Gus, getting involved when needed. Throughout the series Walter struggles to keep his personal and "professional" life separate, with dangerous criminals and the authorities getting too close, Jesse struggles with his conscience in situations and to keep those he cares for safe, Hank gets obsessive about finding those spreading the blue crystal meth across the many states, and Skyler becomes understandably concerned for the safety of her family, as well as depressed and loathsome of Walter. In the end, after the deaths of Gus and Mike and much more going on, Walter's world crumbles when he is exposed for the drug criminal he is, Hank is killed, Jesse is forced to continue cooking by criminals, Walt goes into hiding for months with cancer before returning to see his family one last time and get revenge against the criminals who wronged him, Walt ends up mortally wounded and succumbs to his injury, dying as the police close in. Also starring Betsy Brandt as Marie Schrader, Steven Michael Quezada as Steven "Gomie" Gomez, Charles Baker as Skinny Pete, Jesse Plemons as Todd, Christopher Cousins as Ted Beneke, Laura Fraser as Lydia Rodarte- Quayle, Matt Jones as Badger, Michael Shamus Wiles as ASAC George Merkert, Lavell Crawford as Huell, Krysten Ritter as Jane Margolis, Carmen Serano as Carmen Molina, Emmy nominated Mark Margolis as HÃ©ctor "Tio" Salamanca (the bell ringing wheelchair-bound silent former drug runner and enforcer, one of my favourite characters), David Costabile as Gale Boetticher, Michael Bowen as Uncle Jack and Robert Forster as Ed. Cranston gives a brilliant performance as the ordinary dying man turned ruthless drug maker, he's both the sympathetic and loathsome anti-hero, Paul is equally brilliant as the street-wise drug-taking young man who has an ever-changing personality and a conscience, supporting cast members Gunn and Norris and others give great performances as well. The show I admit started slightly slow, but you are certainly hooked, and by season 2 or 3 you are absolutely gripped and cannot stop watching, it has everything you could ask for: brilliant acting, writing and direction; it has danger, intrigue, small moments of comedy and much more, the best episodes I think are the TV break down in the middle of nowhere and in the lab trying to catch the fly, and of course I agree with critics and opinions that it has a fantastic ending, overall it is a a suitably acclaimed, unmissable and superb crime drama. It won the Golden Globe for Best Television Series - Drama, and it won the Primetime Emmys for Outstanding Drama Series (twice, also nominated three times), Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series (also nominated three times) and Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Drama Series (four times, also nominated five times), and it was nominated for Outstanding Cinematography for a One Hour Series (three times), Outstanding Cinematography for a Single-Camera Series (twice), Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series (five times), Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Drama Series, Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series (three times) and Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Comedy or Drama Series (One Hour) (twice). Very, very good! AMC's Breaking Bad is a terrific show, that has won an unprecedented number of awards, but it's one that is extremely difficult to get into. The show is centered on High School chemistry teacher, Walter White (Bryan Cranston), who discovers he's dying from cancer. Determined not to leave his family with nothing, White teams up with his former student and local drug dealer, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) in an attempt to process and sell crystal meth. Producing the drug isn't the hard part, it's distributing it while staying out of trouble. That's easier said than done, especially when your wife is on your case 24/7, and your brother in-law is a DEA agent.<br/><br/>This show is terrific and worth every second I've spent watching it, but I almost missed out. The pilot episode was not a strong one, in fact, many fans of the show have called it the worst episode of the entire series. If you can make it passed that, the first season isn't much better. The first season is extremely dark and depressing, focusing mainly on Walt's illness and the effect it has on his family. It really wasn't easy to watch, especially if you've like me, and have had family go through the same thing.<br/><br/>The good news is that after the depressing 7 episode first season, the show gets much much better. The network or the producers had to have to seen the same thing that everyone saw and the attention of future episodes is centered around Walt and Jesse's growing business and the problems they have, including nosy family members, the DEA, seedy people looking for a taste, and of course rival dealers and gangs. The show really picks up in the second season and starts to evolve into the award winning crime drama it has become.<br/><br/>Bryan Cranston plays Walt and how good is he? He has won 3 Emmy's, and has been nominated every season the show has been on. The man he plays is so complicated that you really needed the very best actor you could find to play him. Walt White is a mess of emotions, concealed within a strong persona, it's this concealment that also helps to keep his conscience at bay, most of the time.<br/><br/>Jesse Pinkman is played by Aaron Paul who is also very good. Paul himself has been nominated for four Emmy's, winning twice, and will now and forever be required to call people bitch. Paul is a very good actor and does a great job playing a character who I find to be extremely annoying. Jesse is always managing to !@#$ things up, he's always putting them at risk by saying stupid things and doing stupid things. To be honest with you, I don't care much for the character, but the fact that the character, as opposed to the actor, annoys me, shows how strong his performances is.<br/><br/>Walt's family is also a main stay in the show, his wife Skyler (Anna Gunn), is as strong a housewife as I have ever seen. There is nothing Skyler White won't say and she is often Walt's morale compass, albeit one that is remarkably nosy and unappreciative. His son is played by newcomer R.J. Mitte whose handicapped angle is actually real. Mitte was born with cerebral palsy, which effects his speech and movements. He admits that he over-dramatizes the effects for the show, but he is still handicapped in real life and one hell of an inspirational person. Through it all he has never let anyone tell him he can't do anything and he has been open and upfront about his condition to anyone who has asked him about it. He's really an inspiration kid, who took a handicapped and used it to his advantage.<br/><br/>Finally, Walt's brother-in-law, DEA Agent, Hank Schrader (Dean Norris), brings much needed comic relief to a show that can be hard to watch sometimes. Besides being a great cop, Schrader has a personality that is larger than life. Even in the context of a show, where the cops are the bad guys, you find yourself drawn to Schrader and rooting him on.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad has won a total of 7 Emmy Awards and is one of the highest rated shows in cable history. The show most defiantly fits into the category of addictive television, but unlike it's neighboring show, The Walking Dead. The acting is as believable as it gets and the story just gets better and better every season. If you can make it through the slow and depressing first season, you will find an unbelievable show that may very well be one of the best that cable has ever seen. Many of you think Breaking Bad a dark comedy.<br/><br/>I, however, find nothing comedic about the nihilism of drug addiction beyond De Quincy. I saw enough of that in the Sixties, and it wasn't not hilarious then.<br/><br/>Neither do I consider the breakup of the family to be humorous. The absolute amorality of a man destroying other people to profit his own family is incomprehensible to me.<br/><br/>The wanton, pornographically lingering brutality, too, fails to elicit chuckles from me, what with the sundry decapitations, sliced carotid arteries, exploding heads, dissolution in various industrial chemicals, etc., ad nauseam.<br/><br/>As much as I enjoy the writing, acting, cinematography, plotting, and especially characterization of this series, I do so despite the brutalizing effect it has on viewers.<br/><br/>Perhaps I'm an anachronism, for I consider it a cautionary tale rather than a comedy of any shade. If I hadn't watched Deadwood or The Sopranos I would have probably given this a 9. It's definitely nowhere near the quality of the aforementioned shows for several reasons:<br/><br/>1. I cared more for the fate of Al Swearengen than Walter and Jesse. The characters in BB were just not interesting. In fact, Walter towards the end turned into a smug, criminal mastermind without the charm and likeability of Tony.<br/><br/>2. There was far too many contrived scenarios that were conveniently wrapped up with implausibilities. Compare Gus Fring being blown up and still walking out of a room with half his face missing to Christopher handing Tony Ralph's head. Both graphic, only one plausible.<br/><br/>3. As the show's popularity soared so did the pretentiousness and fan service. The lingering shots of debris that were given context in later episodes wasn't clever and didn't add anything. The whole fan discussion after each show that started popping up on Netflix and YouTube with the writers and fans was a cringefest. I'm of the opinion that writers should have ZERO influence from fans and should tell their story unfettered. I just finished binging all five seasons of this show. I went into it not knowing much other than what is described on here in its premise. I was familiar with the hype and knew that many have waxed poetic about this series being the best ever.<br/><br/>I believe the show's greatest strength is its cast. The producers did a great job casting the roles of Hank, Walter, Jesse, Mike, Gus, and Skyler. I found Saul to be annoying, but I guess that was the point, since he was basically an ambulance chasing lawyer with some super great connections. How he got those connections wasn't clear, and he didn't come across to me as a mob lawyer per se, but maybe that was the point too. Mike and Jesse were my favorite characters on the show. I was surprised that Mike didn't kill Walter after Walter killed Gus. And while I'm happy that Jesse didn't die in the series, I found it unbelievable. I kept expecting him to die at the end of each season (except for season 1)and I definitely thought he was a goner in the final episode with that shoot out. How everyone got hit multiple times and Jesse not even touched was beyond me. I guess it was so that he could get his vengeance on Todd for killing Andrea. Walter was very well portrayed, that actor was riveting at times.<br/><br/>What hurts the show most, and the main reason I give it a 7/10, is its pacing. There were very few episodes that didn't drag. That one episode where all they did was try to kill a fly was a total waste of time. Walter's sense of control and perfection were previously and clearly established in cooking meth. If I had been Gus watching him on the cameras, I would have fired him over the loss in cooking time, not to mention the damaging of expensive equipment that occurred. The series had moments of perfection where I was riveted to my TV either through the rising tension, or action that was going on, but there were too many dull moments where I could doze off or not feel bad about getting up to use the bathroom or fix something to eat without pausing the show first. For a show of this subject matter that simply can't happen. I never got invested in it. The series could have ended after Gus died. Gus was the only real threat to Walter. Season 5 didn't have to be made.<br/><br/>If you like shows that have plenty of violence and center around an unlikable antihero, then this is the series for you. Filled with suspense. Jesse Pinkman, the supporting character of breaking bad was just amazing! His entry with the little nude scene was just the entry anyone would expect. Bryan Cranston's acting was superb so was Aaron Paul's, who by the way has not taken any acting classes! The death of Krazy-8 done by Walter White was just the scene anyone would want to see. Overall, it was just perfection!A little comic relief is also given in this, when Walter is in the hospital and the doctor declares the news of him having lung cancer, then Walter pays attention mostly towards the drop of mustard that the doctor has on his coat. Also, in the first episode, when Walter creates a small explosion in the RV where Walter and Jesse first cook methamphetamine. Honestly, I never watched anything of this genre as good (or even close) to this series. <br/><br/>Over the course of 5 seasons, you will witness the evolution of the nerdy, old, overqualified school teacher, Walter White to ruthless, crazy and scary drug criminal. Started from an unexpected tragedy of getting cancer which sparks the criminal mind inside Walter. The first season deals with a struggling Walter juggling his daytime job and his meth-cooking career with Jesse Pinkman, his ex-student. They went through some thick moments as newbies in the upscaled meth operation. The series evolved well as both of them gained enough experiences in the business. This series just got better and better until the end. <br/><br/>I can't help to dislike Hank, though, I really think he should've died earlier lol. But seriously, this series is such a gem, watch it, at least once. Well this is my first review on IMDb and I thought of doing this for the first time,purely because of how classy the show was throughout.The show had twists and turns,so that till the very last episode you have no idea about the outcome of the story.Walter White stars as a pitiful cancer patient and turns out to be perhaps,the worst criminal on TV(someone everyone would want to see the back of).Every episode offers something more exciting than the previous.Breaking Bad should be what defines TV in the 21st century without a doubt.Brilliantly written,equally very well acted and hats off for that man Vince Gilligan for exploring one of the most disgusting business in a way that anyone of all ages could enjoy Masterpiece of the author Vince Gilligan. This series has a bow very special dramatic; Where if you start very slowly to Discover characters. The construction of the universe is slow, with much detail and elements to Regret Later. Everything that happens It has a connection and a reaction. While Character Evolution director Walter White, is very complex and well made, The Evolution secondary character, Jesse Pinkman, is overwhelming. screenwriters series punish knew how well this character, and Change Same at the beginning of the series extraordinary end, many Water passing under the bridge. It costs grab a number, but what Every detail thanks displayed on the screen. The series enjoys Various Genres in its plot, and that makes it very interesting. It has very versatile contents and allows different directors with very different styles Each other, give a touch of magic to the world history. A work of art film series fiction. Have you ever heard your parents say to you something on the lines of, "You weren't alive for any of the great shows back in the day." Well, if you were born >2000, I'd say you were. "Breaking Bad" is such an amazing show. The producers and script writers knew exactly how to get you to connect personally with the characters. They're just so relate able and real-life. It seems like they're just recording the lives of the cast because the actors play their roles beautifully. Many will tell you that it's "over hyped" and i say, yes and don't you think there's a good reason for it? It's very difficult to not spoil anything<br/><br/>so i'm just going to tell you the bear minimum so you can go watch it yourself The main character, Walter White (Bryan Cranston (also played in "Malcom in the Middle another good show) who is in a dead end teaching job AND car washing job full of very disrespectful students. During his 50th birthday, he almost seems left in the dirt behind his sisters husband, Hank Schrader (Dean Norris) who is a cop that is bragging about a massive drug bust. He goes on a ride along with him when he spots one of his former students fall out of a window. You can find out the rest by watching yourself. You WILL NOT regret it. I promise the beginning is very slow but for good reason. The first couple seasons are explaining the characters lives. It is a wonder, and a great mistake on my behalf, that I only got around to watch "Breaking Bad" now in 2016, because I have really been missing out on something phenomenal. What initially made me stay away from the series back when it was airing was the premise of a cancer-struck teacher making methamphetamine. I mean, how much fun could a TV series about such a thing be? But I was put to shame, multiple times over, because "Breaking Bad" is nothing short of extraordinarily spectacular.<br/><br/>The series starts out in a very high gear and never really slows down. Which is a very impressive feat, because it is quite a thing to keep it going at such a high and fast pace for 6 seasons without losing momentum.<br/><br/>What makes "Breaking Bad" so phenomenally good is the combination of a thrilling storyline, interesting and well-fleshed-out characters and a myriad of talents actors and actresses to portray these characters. The storyline and the characters come off as being believable and realistic and that is one of the aspects that really appealed to me. And also that Bryan Cranston was superbly cast for the role of Walter White.<br/><br/>I sat through all episodes in all of the six seasons in a very short time, and it seemed like I had just started when I reached the very last episode. A testimony to how compelling and captivating the storyline really was.<br/><br/>"Breaking Bad" combines seriousness and light comedy in a good manner, which does work quite well.<br/><br/>The only downside to the series is that it does suffer from predictability. You know what will happen to Walter White and Jesse Pinkman ahead of time, as they are the two main characters. But it is not really a factor that drags down the overall enjoyment of the series in any way. Especially because the director managed to build up the scenes throughout the series in a manner that you really want to see what happens, despite of you already knowing it.<br/><br/>Well, there are actually two downsides to the series, come to think of it, and the other being that it is unlikely that you will sit down to watch it a second time, as the series doesn't seem to have that much repeated watching value.<br/><br/>If you, like me, have missed out on this TV series, then you really should do yourself a favor and sit down to watch it, because it is really a blast of a TV show. I was skeptical at first as I don't typically go in for what others consider "all the rage" of the moment. But since I enjoy shows like The Sopranos, The Wire, etc. I thought I would give it a whirl. Right from the beginning I was hooked. Great characters, fantastic acting, and top notch writing all combine for an amazing series from beginning to end. It's not all 100% perfect but somehow that is even better than if it were perfect. Sort of like looking at an air-brushed photo of a supermodel...it just ain't real. This series, my friends shows what television can accomplish through great story-telling and edge-of-your-seat presentation. I will be following the careers of those who are behind the making of this fine series with great interest. The Staff writers of "Breaking Bad" managed to turn it into a rare series of television landscape. Although quite a successful series captured the screen with the season, sweeping quality, but very few were able to reproduce the same initial success and prove themselves even during periods that came later. Creators of "Breaking Bad" managed an impressive juggling walk on thin line, and for five seasons maintained a high standard of plot, aesthetics and attention to detail. These were signed for a brave decision to avoid tricks screenwriters or vague questions and provide a series an clear,complete and rewarding end. This show is as addictive as the drug depicted in it. This show not only brought on laughter, tears, and a sense of fear... but the realization of the true potential Bryan Cranston has to be the greatest actor of all time.<br/><br/>If you are considering watching this show, you must do it. As odd as the description may sound, it is incredible relevant. I found myself connecting with the main characters more than I would like to admit. It drew out emotions in me that I never thought a TV show ever could. It may sound a bit over the top to say something like that... but you can only understand by watching this show. Never have I EVER seen any actor preform as POWERFULLY and CONVINCINGLY as Bryan Cranston did in this series.<br/><br/>This show proved me many things... but the message that will stick with me forever, is that we all "Break Bad". IMDb is a excellent page but the problem is that a lot of people who like the other highest TV dislike pretty much the series, how is possible that Breaking Bad have under 8/10 episodes?...<br/><br/>Fly is maybe The worst episode but this series really have a bad episode, i'm not saying that 7 is bad number for the series but how is possible that One Minute have 8,8? really....well? 9,9 is the minimum...<br/><br/>IMDb users have at lest watch the series, if this page keep going on like this, for me is not what i'm looking for. it's a reall shame because is a page who has everything for a good review. It's hard to say something that hasn't been said about this TV show before. just to start with a cast, their acting was above every level of awesomeness, every single character, their lines, all of them were very interesting. plot was unbelievably cool, they way Walter Walter's character changed over every episode was just mind-blowing, it was done in such a way that you don't even notice until he does something unexpected. the final was one of the best endings I've ever seen, it was just pure definition of perfect. you literally can't find any flaws in this show. even most boring episode (fly) was very interesting because of it's dialog, and character development. pure awesomeness, can't say more. This show is the most BadAss TV show i ever watched. Awesome script, killer dialogs, best acting...this show has everything it takes to make the best show ever. When i first started watching it, i thought its too slow or seemed like it lacked the spark. The reason was i could not connect to its story but when i did its all i could think and talk about. All the time i used to watch which even made my friend and family addicted to it. And you wont stop saying "Yeah B***H". So believe me its worth the time. Bryan Cranston and AARon Paul made justice to their characters, superb acting...also the other actors did a great job in playing their character. There was never a time where i felt that these characters wouldn't exist in real life. Even though Skyler made me furious sometimes. My First review here, so let's go to it.<br/><br/>After Watching Breaking Bad this year i was in shock because it was Such a great show that i had to keep digging and finding more info about the show and maybe alternate reads of it, after seeing the color theory i will have to re-watch the whole show and pay more attention god i want to erase my mind and watch it always i'm jealous of EVERYONE who can watch breaking bad at first such a beautiful series my favorite of all time by FAR.<br/><br/>After the End and all of my research on the internet i have finally landed here and absolutely Agree with the grades (execpt the series it should be a 9,8 MINIMUM but h8rs everywhere), and man i think no series will ever get a 10 again because giving a 10 to another show would be the same that being said it's even with breaking bad and at this point no show is even close so like the title says: It will be Hard to give another 10 after seeing this show. I can't get myself to give anything above a 9/10 on anything, because I believe that means it's got to be absolutely perfect, however in a way I feel this show deserves that.<br/><br/>I will not to go into detail, but seeing a high school chemistry teacher, Walter White (played by the brilliant Bryan Cranston) manufacture crystal methamphetamine to pay for his medical bills and provide for his family when he's gone is obviously a very intriguing plot. Added to that you have terrific writing, brilliant character development and a good supporting cast.<br/><br/>Yes it does get very violent at times, and Aaron Paul's character can be very annoying, but I believe this is how the writers intended it to be, and with 2 Golden Globes, another 114 awards and 192 nominations, there's very little to argue about. Not surprised that Bob Odenkirk's character, Saul Goodman got his own spin-off show titled "Better Call Saul", that would be interesting to watch. First of all, anyone who claims that this show is overrated or not that great or only gives it 1-4 stars either: a) never watched it b)is jealous that it is critically acclaimed more than their favorite show, c)doesn't know art or acting or d)is stupid or e)all of the above. <br/><br/>That being said, this film, yes film-its not really a TV show since it is moving towards a conclusion from episode 1 and the story arc and acting talent and writing are all more cinematic than television- is not for people who have ADD or can't think. It's not for short attention spans. If you're stupid you won't like it. It's for smart people who know art and filmmaking, which is why it won and was nominated for so many Emmy awards and awards in general. <br/><br/>It has the highest rating in the guiness book of world records, was lauded by critics, showered with emmies and trophies, and big name superstars like Stephen King, Anthony Hopkins, and many more stand by their praise that it's the "greatest show" they ever seen. <br/><br/>It actually deserves more than 10/10. It's genius, a masterstroke of art, brilliant, and transcends the medium. Anyone who thinks it's a 1-4 star rating is nuts. Not only is it in many top critics' picks the greatest show of all time, but it has the hardware (Emmies and trophies of all awards) to prove it. The Writers Guild voted it #11 all time on its Best Written Shows list. That's probably not just- it should be in the Top 3, but that's All- Time. <br/><br/>If you don't appreciate Breaking Bad, you don't know movies, acting, art, and you can't be very intelligent. It's mind blowingly great filmmaking and definitely is an All American Classic for the Ages. <br/><br/>If you never saw it, be patient. It starts slow, especially the middle of season 2 and some of the beginning of 3, but if you can stay in there and not read the spoilers, I guarantee you this will be the greatest thing you ever experienced on a screen- greater than any movie you ever saw. A classic masterpiece hands down, bar none. 20/10. "Greatest Show of All Time." Guaranteed. And best acting performances of the past 50 years. This entire show is an absolutely flawless work of art. Fantastic writing brought to life by some outstanding performances, especially from Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul whose relationship is really the foundation throughout all 5 seasons of the show. The great character development will leave you with strong feelings towards each character, be it love (Jesse) or hate (Skyler).<br/><br/>More than just a show about drugs, this show investigates how a 50- year-old man can turn from "Mr Rodgers with lung cancer" to a criminal mastermind and shows how this sends his life spiraling into darkness. <br/><br/>This is done is such a way that will leave you wanting more after every episode - I finished the entire show in a week! I truly believe this show is unrivaled in TV today, including GOT which I am also a fan of. I have watched and re-watched Breaking Bad with family and friends, and if you have not seen it yet, I would highly encourage you to get watching! You will not be disappointed. well, I am new to American TV serials. Watching this was tough as the sequences shot are really long and the story moves at a slower pace, but as the serial approaches the final season it just compensates everything... the ending was just fabulous... watch it for its ending, it deserves that...<br/><br/>Every episode starts with a prologue, which actually obliges you to think, and as the story towards the end, they drop a clue for the upcoming serial which again makes you say, DAMN IT, LET ME HIT THE NEXT ONE NOW...<br/><br/>The way they have blended the chemistry aesthetics in the whole plot is really adorable, which is easily understood.<br/><br/>Overall, if u like suspense and those swanky tricks and turns in the story, then this one is for you. But... you've gotta wait for it... ;) I know I am jumping on the band wagon here, but in my defense, I started watching this show from almost the first episode. My mother recommended it to me. I remember going to FX On Demand often to see if there were any new episodes. They were far and few in between at first I think they were being picked up on a show by show basis. I remember when Aaron Paul tried to shove himself into a bin to see if they would be able to put a body in it after Walter shot the guy they are keeping down in the basement. I don't remember his name because that was like the first season. I just became, like everyone else in the country, addicted to this show. Its character driven and plot driven. I love the different characters they introduced like Saul and Chucko and Gus. The whole Gus story arc has amazing. I would find myself gasping and saying, "man I love this show"! Two that come to mind are Aaron Paul's girlfriend Over-dose scene and the plant in Walters's back yard. If you've seen the show, you know what I mean. GASP! They are scenes that establish how much Walter is actually, "Breaking Bad". This show totally deserves the Emmy's it's won. When Jessie gets beaten up by Hank and ends up in the hospital and the rant he goes on about Hank was great. I was even thinking, he's going to get an Emmy for this. It is just a truly well written show with no gimmicks or loads of special FX to over-shadow the great story telling. My favorite thing about it is the relationship between Jessie and Walter. Those two are great together. If you are one of the only people left in the country who haven't seen this show, watch it now! The entire series becomes addictive after watching a couple of episodes of first season. It reaches its peak in the last two seasons.<br/><br/>The journey of Walter white is like a roller coaster ride and the intelligence of the character mesmerizes you.<br/><br/>I had a marathon course while watching it and by the time i finished I felt the same way it feels like finishing a good book. <br/><br/>The best part is you are introduced to interesting characters all way and most of them make an impact as much as the lead characters. <br/><br/>The creators have made a good story and the scenes and direction of each episode is flawless.. I happened to watch the story making time-lapse video of an episode of breaking bad and truly appreciate the effort put into it. <br/><br/>I can undoubtedly say that this is the best TV show I ever watched and a highly addictive one. This is simply not a series to be missed. This is the best show that's ever been on TV and I have only just started series 5, the casting is perfect, the characters unforgettable and the story completely unpredictable, I cant recommend Breaking Bad enough and the people I have told about it have all loved it! The character progression is just fantastic as you see it unfold, I just don't know what will fill its place when I finish season 5. Walter White is the man, Jesse amazing, Gus is terrifying, Mike also, Hank is great as the DEA man and the numerous bad guys that we come across just make this show the most watchable, nerve wracking, tense and basically fantastic watch of all time. Watch it! When evaluating a show you must first establish the criteria that you are basing it upon, for Breaking Bad, those criteria are characters that you develop an emotional attachment to and are generally concerned for their well being, secondly the story has to hook you in and makes you want to watch the show. From the very beginning of the show the story line hooks you in when Walter White, the main character who is played by Bryan Cranston, is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. Walter has a wife who is pregnant and a son; he is a high school chemistry teacher who also works part time at the local car wash. The story progresses at a fast pace but not fast enough where following along is hard, it details his life and how he comes to be able to afford the chemotherapy that he badly needs to save his life. Walter begins to cook methamphetamine with a local drug dealer, Jesse Pinkman, who was also a former student of his. Jesse and Walt are very different people, for Jesse this is his life style for Walt this is a get rich quick scheme to pay for cancer treatment. The interactions between Jesse and Walt are often comical and lay the foundation for a partnership between the two, Jesse the veteran drug dealer who knows the ins and outs of selling drugs in the city and Walt the chemistry genius in charge of cooking the meth. The writers do a great job at getting you emotionally attached to both Walter and Jesse, you want them to succeed and you want Walter to get his chemotherapy treatments. Walter's wife Skylar is another reason why you become attached to Walter, he has a happy family with another child on the way, and she is kept completely in the dark as to how the chemo is being paid for. But just having a good cast is not enough for a TV show to be great, the story they are telling you is equally as important, if the story is boring and uneventful there is no reason to watch.<br/><br/>The story from episode one is thrilling and it emerges you into the world of Breaking Bad. When Walters's brother-in-law is introduced, he is a DEA agent about to raid a suspected meth lab and Walter goes with as a ride along. Walter catches Jesse slipping out of the window of the next door neighbor's house but doesn't say anything; because he is already scheming about possible going into business with Jesse. Once you think you have a firm grasp of the direction that the story is heading, the writers introduce a new element that completely sends the story in another route. A good example of how the writers do this is when Walter and Jesse were on one of their first cooks, in the middle of the Arizona desert in their mobile cook station inside of an RV. Walter crashes the RV into a sand dune, in the background you faintly hear sirens coming closer and closer to where Walter had crashed. As the sirens crescendo, you begin to think how can they get away from the police? At this point Walter has pistol to his head ready to end it, as he pulls the trigger it clicks, the gun was still on safe. He does not even know how to work a gun. As the camera pans to the sound of the sirens it is a fire engine, not a police car, racing to put a brush fire out in the desert. That crisis has been adverted and you really are starting to become hooked on this show, it is exciting and keeps you sitting on the edge of your seat for the whole hour you are watching. With the combination of a cast that you are emotionally attached to and a story line that makes you want to feel attached to the cast and a story that is both entertaining and enthralling Breaking Bad is the best show on television. I know thats a pretty generic title that you probably hear a lot but this is no exaggeration. This show is pure gold from start to finish of every episode. I watch the new episodes every Sunday religously and I cant wait until the rest of the season is aired. They are one season 5 and sadly it is going to be the last season.<br/><br/>This show stars Bryan Cranston. You may remember him as the goofy dad on Malcolm in the middle. Though in this show he is anything but goofy he is cool and calculating. Every performance of his is so good I really never thought he could act so well but every episode Im blown away. The side cast all does a very good job and the writing is just so intense and suspenseful it keeps you guessing every second.<br/><br/>This movie is about a chemistry teacher named Walter White(Cranston) who is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. His world is shaken when he finds out knowing that without him his family will certainly suffer monetarily. So he makes the decsision to cook meth in order to provide for his family once hes gone though once entering the drug game things start to go out of control.<br/><br/>This is with out a doubt the best show on television Im so upset this is the last season. This show is great for anyone who likes suspense and a terrific show. Some people are put off by the subject matter of this show but that should not put you off if you don't watch this show you are missing out greatly. I hadn't watched this show until I heard Louis Ferreira was going to be in it. He is the best actor, and if they keep him on the show, I will be watching every week. Louis is the most gifted and talented actor ever. I can vision his character being just what the show needed, to take them to the next level. Louis can accelerate this show to the top of its potential. If you were a fan of the show before Louis, just wait, you haven't seen anything yet. He will blow your mind, and nobody could play this type of role better than him. To all you Louis fan's, I know you all feel as strongly about him as I do. Good call BB casting! Your lucky to have him. Treat him right! this is a well made series so far there are only 4 series and do not know if there will be any more<br/><br/>well watching this series was great did not expect it , it got a low viewing rate because i think it was not as commercial as other but its one of them when you watch it , you want to see it till the end <br/><br/>Bryan Cranston is the main character who is the dad in MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE , and he was the best thing about MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE and he is a true actor in this series and is very entertaining to watch , this series has a great ending <br/><br/>the way its been shot with the camera is nice and there is some cg work as well that looks good <br/><br/>i would like to say much more about this series as there is a lot to say but its best to see it for your self , what can i say but its well put together in my opinion okay, so recently i was recommended a show. it was called dexter. i got so hooked on it that watched the first 5 seasons in 5 days. 12 hour a day sessions. i was like seriously hooked on it. once that finished i decided it was the best show i had ever seen... the same man who recommended that show then said "watch this"... and gave me seasons 1-4 of breaking bad. "its the dad from malcolm in the middle being a bad ass...". i was sceptical to say the least. i stuck it on and watched the first 3 eps. it was OK, but seemed a little disjointed. but i persisted and am so pleased i did. because after that it just took off. had me totally hooked. cranstan is just brilliant as the chemic genius walter white. but he is backed up by the even better arron paul as the street wise yet quite stupid jesse pinkman. the chemistry (excuse the pun) between the two is incredible and you get engrossed in the relationship that develops between the two as much as you do with the story itself. brilliantly written. beautifully acted. and dare i say... better than dexter... pfffffft..... its a bold statement but i think it may be you know... :) The first five minutes or so in the pilot episode did not have me very hopeful, but thankfully I kept watching because of the strong recommendations from friends and the exceptionally good reviews and awards it is noted for. The storyline, however brief is pretty much to the point. From that base, the writers have done an outstanding job. I liked that the cable broadcast domain does not restrict the writers and the producer from letting loose their creative juices; this series would never have seen the light of day in regular TV.<br/><br/>The very talented cast of actors was a delight to watch and a revelation in some instances. Watch the first season and you are hooked; the pun was too easy to resist. I have watched all four seasons and though I'm surprised there will be a fifth, I'm also thrilled and can't wait for it. There is so much going on, action, drama, some funny parts and the realism is its trademark now. If you haven't seen it, do; if you have and I assume you liked it of course, by all means recommend it to friends. They'll thank you for that. My guess is yes definitely. It's a brilliant piece of art, nasty and extremely shocking. I watched the first Season and I thought, yeah well, it's awesome, but I think Dexter is still better. Then I watched the second Season and was like, alright then, but I think the second Season of Dex was still a bit better. But then with the third Season and thing became sure. This Show is better than Dexter. Beter than every Series I've ever seen. But finally after thinking it can't get more thrilling, the fourth Season came along and blew my mind in every Episode. These perfectly worked out Characters this visual brilliance, this extremely convincing story. The way this writers made you love and hate all the Characters at the same time. And of course, the unbelievable shocking events of the final Episode of Season IV that blew my mind and left me in a numb mood that least for hours. Amazing, f***ing Amazing! Breaking Bad is simply brilliant, there is no other way to describe this show. It is the best acted show currently on TV and maybe all-time. There are not enough words to describe Bryan Cranston's portrayal of Walter White. His 3 emmy's speak for itself. Just like Vic Mackey on The Shield, the protagonist is becoming the antagonist but you continue to root for the guy. Aaron Paul has been unbelievable as his side kick Jesse and in my opinion gave a better performance during the ground breaking 3rd season. The concept and plot may initially turn you off but if you enjoyed The Wire, Sopranos, Mad Men, or The Shield then I guarantee you will enjoy this show. It may not be at The Wire and The Soprano's level yet, but one more season of greatness will put it right in the pantheon of dramas. This is my first review, however I thought I had to mention what a great show this really is! The first season is great, the second, in my opinion, is probably even better, and the third season is a little slower but some of the episodes are especially well written and acted. The way the characters develop throughout the show is nothing short of a masterpiece. The acting is top drawer. I never really rated Bryan Cranston before I saw him in this show. However I obviously overlooked what an amazing actor he really is. Aaron Paul as well plays the role brilliantly and provides a stunningly powerful performance, especially in season 2. To anyone reading this who is hoping to stumble across a GREAT show and hasn't decided whether they should give this show a go, all I have to say is please do, you will not regret it. Unfortunately this show has been slow to come onto UK TV, but this is probably THE best American TV show I have watched. Its better than any film because the characters are truly given time needed to develop. Is it 9.5 ? Its jokeðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
All 4 seasons 0/10
Season 5 4/10 I watched all seasons and for me this is the most boring show ever. Dont like it a bir. Overhyped and overrated This century three serials have perked things up like never before on the "vast wasteland". The Soprano's (begun in 99) , Six Feet Under and Breaking Bad are all filled with suspenseful twists well developed characters and story lines that left you guessing and hungry for more after each episode. Yet all imploded before they crossed the finish line. In the case of Six Feet it was in the last five minutes but in the case of The Soprano's and Breaking Bad hanging around a half season too long when things began to unravel like a bad Christmas sweater as logic and plausibility went on flights of fancy and perhaps greedy producers squeezed the life out of both.<br/><br/>Science teacher and part time car wash cashier Walt Williams celebrates his fiftieth birthday by getting a bleak cancer diagnosis. With a wife, child and one on the way his desperation gets the best of him and he hooks up with former wash out student Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) to produce methamphetamine out of a Winnebago. Walter wants in and out after he makes enough for some solid gold health care that will save his life. But once in he finds it is hard to walk away, especially since he is producing a superior product that gains the attention of a Mexican cartel. He then becomes intoxicated by the power transitioning from mild mannered science teacher to megalomaniac drug trade legend "Heisenberg".<br/><br/>Bryan Cranston's transformation is one riveting and absorbing performance as he moves towards the dark side, believable on both ends. As his drug whacked assistant Aaron Paul follows suit while creator Vince Gilligan over the first four and a half seasons keeps a tight grip on storyline by introducing a series of intriguing and comic characters pertinent to the telling, keeping it buoyant and suspenseful with some powerful twists. Of particular note Dean Norris as his narc brother in law from the outset, Bob Odenkirk as shyster lawyer Saul Goodman, Jonathan Banks as aging hit man Mike and especially the subdued menace of major player Gus Fring by one of the most underutilized fine actors in film Gian Carlo Esposito.<br/><br/>With a boatload of talent contributing unique and fully fleshed out characterizations and Gilligan connecting dots (unlike Chase in the Soprano's who began to scribble late in the series by going off on hunting expeditions with peripheral characters resulting in gross distractions) Breaking Bad's first four seasons was serial television at its best. Season five started off well but then as it headed towards denouement logic broke down and absurd reasoning took over. It was understandable for Walt with his terminal case of Lord Acton's disease to behave this way but disingenuous for the cooler heads such as the by the book Schrader going semi-solo without back up and the newly minted millionaire desperadoes opting to "live it up" in a fenced in compound in the dessert. Adding insult to injury and with nowhere to go Gilligan has Walt ride to the rescue via sloppy Deus Ex Machina with a multitude of casualties that unfortunately includes the series itself. Boring , and i think the whole story can be presented in 3 or 2 seasons While the idea behind this series is brilliant somehow the writers are unwilling to progress the story further than what already happened in season 1. Sure, the bad guys die and are replaced by other bad guys but the situation Walter White is in the middle of season one is the same as where he is now, s05e11. Nothing really happened. Make some money, don't use it and have your wife nag at you, your side kick be angry at you and himself, your brother-in-law at your heels and his wife being a nag as well. He becomes harder but he still makes the same hard decisions the same way. This is no Sophranos, this is more like the A-team, the same episode with different players every episode. There is not a man alive that could love Skyler enough to still do so after 4 seasons. And he is obviously in love with Jesse Pinkman because keeping cool with his mistakes is something his personality has no reason whatsoever to do. And now at the end his brother in law has a moment of clarity caused by his initials while the dude has been showing up all the time in his investigation with no effect. Suddenly he is Mr Supercop. Plus 1 for Heisenberg, Gus, Mr Pollo, Gale and Saul. Minus 2 for Skyler and Pinkman because they really annoy. Minus 2 also for a story that doesn't go anywhere, there are no real consequences. It's a roller coaster of love and hate and a finale full of depression and hate - no love for me.
Very hard to watch if you ask me.
Well written, great actors, very nice cinematography; love the conversation long shots.
It was worth the time. A long painful journey. One of the few series I could watch twice. Just not now. The show literally brought the desert,heat,the lab in my room! Was baffled to see the performance! The way the story was breaking bad along with the characters, leave you stunned Season 1. 90
Season 2. 90
Season 3. 95
Season 4. 99
Season 5. 95
Season 6. 100 Keep watching it, the first 5 episodes might be a little bit boring. But after that you wont stop watching it!
Very recommended! Unbelievable good series. All seasons are great. Good acting. Wide range of both likable and hateable characters. Deep and completely story with many layers. This is a show that i had not stopped watching for days until i had finished it as it had a story line that continued throughout the whole show and had not changed, this helps the watcher keep interest in the program and creates a sense of familiarity with all of their characters and their roles. The show is widely based around a man called Walter White how is a chemistry teacher at a high school, he then finds out that he has been diagnosed with cancer and to help pay for the treatment he starts cooking Meth. This then sparks a wide range of problems and stories that we see within the show. Altogether this is a very good TV show that is enough to last a while and keep you engaged and i would recommend this to anyone who has an interest in American TV shows or Netflix Originals. Walter gets up at 5am to exercise on the tedious stepper machine. His paltry recognition award for contributing to research awarded the Nobel prize is next to his award of merit from the public school system, immediately highlighting that he hasn't achieved his potential. He gets lame veggie bacon on his 50th birthday. He has to watch his cholesterol. His students are unenthusiastic and don't appreciate his passion for chemistry. He eats lunch hunched over and alone in the teachers' office. He has a side job as a cashier and is forced by his boss to do car detailing for one of his obnoxious students. The latch on his glove compartment is broken. He gets an unwelcome surprise party, and his wife chastises him for being late. After he gets his cancer diagnosis his wife tells him he used the wrong credit card. You just want him to stand up for himself. It's so satisfying when he finally does. Eventually he does things that make us question if we should be rooting for him. Great storytelling, and the sets and camera work are stellar as well. 10/10 I like the bit where they make crystal meth in the back of an RV Breaking Bad is a protracted Macbeth. It tells the same story, it just takes much longer to get to the point: relatively average man by all accounts has the opportunity to benefit from an evil deed, so he does the evil deed. But then he learns that sin corrupts and blinds the intellect, and evil deed after evil deed, evil becomes more and more easy to commit, and eventually is just about the only thing the person is capable of.<br/><br/>The show-- although this goes unreported-- issues many challenges to materialist philosophies and the like. Although modern, it is also very anti-modern in important ways.<br/><br/>Took away one star because there's some smut the show didn't need. Otherwise, the gold standard. No 1 in all i have been seen
I'll be seeing agian and again JUST THE GREAT TV SHOW ON THE HISTORY. GREAT ACTING WITH GREAT STORY. HIS GONNA STAY ON MY MEMORY FOR EVERE I'll keep it short: Each episode may not be better than the last, and there are certaintly "filler" moments in the show like any other, but never has a show been able to get you so invested into its story and characters like this one. Each season is better than the last and each big moment will have another to one up it till its finale, which isn't the best of all time, but certaintly better than Game of Thrones. Don't care who you are, you have to watch this show. It may be slow at first, but it is so worth it till the end. No matter what. JKKsjKsksikskskskksls

First two seasons are boring but the last 3 are masterpieces, worth watching not a waste of time The best TV shows I have ever seen in this TV shows you see how chemical teacher gonna be the king of meth in United states This show was pretty awesome, it had a great storyline. I like how walters character evolved to something ruthless. I didnt care too much for the jesse character, he was predictable in his actions Awsomme film keeping it coming more more episodes, bravo bravo bravo Like the title says, it's simply the best thing ever. By far one of if not the greatest TV shows of all time!! This show deserves all the praise it gets!<br/><br/>Season 1:
Starts off great to hook you in and gives you an idea of how good the actors are<br/><br/>Season 2:
Picks up in Season 2. Tuco is a great villain and the whole thing with the teddy bear is awesome and suspenseful! Great season<br/><br/>Season 3:
Season 3 is my least favorite season although it has some great episodes and scenes. Especially the scene where Hank gets shot!<br/><br/>Season 4:
Arguably the best season! Gus is probably the best antagonist on the show and the finale to this season is amazing!!<br/><br/>Season 5:
Starts off a bit slow but it's last 10 episodes are absolutely incredible! The end to this show is the best ending to a show I've ever watched!<br/><br/>Breaking Bad truly is up there in the greatest shows of all time! Vince Gilligan's directing is great and the acting is superb!! Recommend this show to anyone looking to watch something incredible!!<br/><br/>10/10 What can I say? This was one of the best series I have ever watched period... Nothing can even come close to it. Awesome best there is....period no doubt because it has spin offs because people can't get enough. It's just the dream show for everyone .. if you watch it for watching you'll get your fun .. if you wanna critical analysis you'll have fun analysing every little detail .. the direction was so good the actors and actresses were soooo damn good from Walter White to the fly!!! The sympolism the reality the morality every moment of Breaking bad takes you to a whole other word and to the real word at the same time .. really thanks a lot for such show and thanks for whoever recommended to me!! Constantly engaging, brutally breathtaking scenarios at points, pitch-perfect emotions and great level acting this is what makes all seasons of Breaking Bad very catchy. Memorable characters and extraordinary camerawork are its biggest strength supported by juicy plotting and a-level of dialogue and writting. Show for a lifetime. As the title says, I've just finished watching breaking bad through to the end for the 4th time. What an absolute masterpiece of writing, casting and acting. Infinitely watchable. The best TV series I've ever seen and I envy those who have yet to see it. Best show ever made in modern times. This show send you on a hard rollercoster of emotions. I've rewatched this show 4 times and just started on first season once again with my boyfriend that have never seen the show, so im enjoying him watching it for the first time at the moment I don't watch much of the series because I don't have time, but we only saw 5 episodes of the series. I missed this show when It originally aired and after hearing all of the hype from friends and family: I just had to see what all of the fuss was about.<br/><br/>Bryan Cranston from TV's ' Malcolm In the Middle ' stars as Walter White a chemistry Teacher who has seems to have It all a loving wife a caring son and a Job that he loves but after recieving some startling News; and a run In with an ex pupil named Jesse Pinkman played Aaron Paul he makes a decision that will change the course of his life forever.<br/><br/>This show Is a masterclass In writing and acting Bryan Cranston gives a tour de force performance you can't help both simutaneously sympathise with Walter's plight, while at the same time despise him while he is led down the garden path.
Aaron paul Is perfectly cast as Jesse Pinkman, who Is a lost soul who has been turned away by society and his parents due to his Inability to find a steady Job.
The supporting cast fare well Dean Norris Is funny and engaging as the noble if Slightly racist D.E.A. Agent 'Hank Schrader'; While Johnathan Banks oozes Coolness and Authority as Mike Emanhtraught.<br/><br/>The first season wasn't brilliant by any means, It was Just establishing the setting as well as characterization e.g. motivations etc.<br/><br/>And from the 2nd season,I was hooked If you like Anthology series series such as 'True Detective and Fargo' this will definately be up your alley. Walter Hartwell White Sr. Is, a, monster! But, aren't, we, all!<br/><br/>I cried, my heart pounded! I turned away from the screen on several occasions.<br/><br/>I couldn't help but care for these characters.<br/><br/>This show may well be the best TV show I have ever seen.<br/><br/>I've not long finished the last episode. And I'm going to watch it all again.<br/><br/>"I did it all for me, it made me feel ALIVE!"<br/><br/>OH! TO FEEL ALIVE!!!!!!! I can't stop watching it. Thanks a lot Netflix!!! Truly terrific and original!! For me, Breaking Bad was really good. I would highly recommended getting in to this because you might enjoy this. Best TV show i've seen, and the only TV show that I rated 10. Becomes a drug manufacturer wanting to secure and protect his family's future. Best series in the world
like all of it
is like a lesson for your live After watching compelte 5 seasons, i depressed too much. I missed my friend Hank.i cried for him two days.
Also for walter and jesi. I wish there were alive. I wanna lose my memory so that i can watch entrie series once again. After watching it, I can die peacefully. This is the best best tv series i watched.superb...i like this...10/10 Most simple way of how a good man break bad. Simple life experience of a chemistry professor The breaking bad is a good serials This is the best piece of television I have viewed so far, ever. I can say that with resolution. From the highly subtle and sensitive character development, to the outrageous and surprising twists and turns the plot takes, every scene is a necessity in the development of the story. No stone is left unturned. At no point do you feel like you want to scream "why are you doing that?!" and if you do, there is a definite and clear reason as to why the characters act in the way they do, often far more clever and calculated than any viewer could predict.
It is a carefully constructed combination of dry, dark humour and horrifyingly gory, depressing scenes, yet, beautifully paired with experimental cinematography, it manages to leave you constantly assessing and evaluating true morality. The plethora of particular camera angles, use of various filters, the brilliant soundtrack and the ambience of each scene is always somewhat upbeat, despite the many dire situations that the characters involve themselves with.
Having watched this series multiple times, I am truly never disappointed by a scene. Each scene is carefully constructed to lay bare the questions that we would ask within ourselves throughout different phases of our lives. Even, for example, the episode where Walt becomes obsessed with a fly - that is another very intricate yet important character building expression.
Vince Gilligan, Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul and Co truly capture an essence within our humanity that we ourselves cannot necessarily comprehend until we are exposed to empathissing with these emotional situations, through this series. Extremely accessible and relatable whilst also totally shocking in parts, it is a rollercoaster ride throughout, leaving you feeling simultaneously defeated yet very much empowered by the end. The best tv show ever. Amazing characters and story Easily my best series ever
Can't wait for the movie!! Best show ever . I mean this story tells how a good man make bad decisions and gets away from his family. Because all he did for its family he says in the end he says All I did it for me . That's what satisfaction to him . And he feels while working He's alive. ðŸ”¥ðŸ’¯ I like the end and everything and i like the characters like (mike-saul-walt-jessy-gus) From the best 25 series ever and it deserves more rating than this Great show, lost it's way a little in the middle but the ending was so strong. A great TV series. AMAZING! Super series totally love it! It has everything and more, fantastic acting Breaking bad is a series that never get out of theme and tempo, it is a perfect example of ending a series on a high note, most of the shows don't cope up, the writing, screenplay, acting. Everything is top notch, and few of people have watched better call Saul, it's a sub series of breaking bad, and will give you goosebumps. The one of the most amazing tv show and walter white have a great In winter we must protect ourselves, look after one another. When the snow falls and the white winds blow, the lone wolf dies, but the pack survives. Okay I get that calling it flawed and giving it full marks seems a bit silly, but frankly despite the parts of the show that I don't personally like 100% I cannot mark it down for them. I think that if I don't say this is a real 10 out of 10 that no show ever would be, every show will have its flaws. But the rating is a reflection of just how good the series got at it's peak and the journey you go through watching it. I'm always skeptical when a new show is made out to be one of the best ever, because it rarely ever lives up to that. Luckily I caught this at the beginning before people really made a fuss over it.<br/><br/>So what exactly are the flaws for me? This will no doubt be an unpopular opinion but Jesse Pinkman simply isn't a great character, he is only there due to Walt's original problem entering into the drug trade. He does show some character progression from being an addict and getting past it eventually. But beyond that he is simply an inconvenience and he always has something that is keeping him completely miserable on top of that he ends up with a holier than thou attitude when it suits. Walt himself asks what exactly does Jesse bring to the operation? and other characters such as Gustavo Fring see the same and want him out in one way or another. He seems only to get through because Walt has a bond with him. He does have a moment in later seasons were you get the impression he has learnt from Walt but for me it doesn't make up for several seasons of dragging his heels. Going back to the series later made me realise he's more unlikeable than Skyler, why? Because he's in every single episode.<br/><br/>The other big flaw for me is no doubt another unpopular one, despite a lot of positive reviews I really did not like the ending of the series. The reason it was a let down, despite knowing that Walt will die eventually from his illness the season essentially teased a better ending earlier were Walt goes off the grid. It could have finished on a note like that and it would have been better, instead they felt they had to have Walt's demise concluded and Jesse had to be rescued one more time and despite that there is no real long term closure in the episode for Jesse he literally just drives off into the distance. I am being overly critical as both endings would have left questions either way, I think that if I hadn't had an episode were Walt disappeared that the actual ending would bug me as much.<br/><br/>So what makes this series still a 10/10 for me? There are several characters who really make the show, Walt is a big part of that. Bryan Cranston is one of the few actors who could still win you over even when he becomes an antihero. The main villains in Mike Ehrmantraut and Gustavo Fring are formidable, they steal any scene they're in. Hank is intelligent, witty and likeable. I feel that Walt Jr and Marie are also very important characters, they're the mediator between both sides. On top of that the stories each of these characters have are creative, well scripted and so intense. I would say that Mike and Hank are my two favourite characters and considering they both get killed the show never lost me. It would be easy to see your favourite character go (nevermind two of them) and just want to stop watching. After finishing this show I became sad because I didn t find any other shows with the same levels as Breaking Bad Goodbye Walter white
I know what you've been through
I can feel you
I can feel how tired you are S1E3... Krazy-8 called it right there and then. "Your real problem is sitting upstairs." Jesse... Jesse mofo Pinkman. Now... BrBa isn't something new, and there have probably been doctorates written about it already. So I'll just summarize my emotions about the conclusion. I won't mark it as a spoiler, because it isn't. Besides... no matter how I describe Jesse - the truth is always worse.<br/><br/>To start off, BrBa reminded me of the final episode of Riget, another all-time cult classic, something that had a more abrupt ending and a far worse legacy, thanks to Steven bloody King. In that episode, the main actress was chasing someone and had to take an elevator down. And the elevator went to floor 0... -5... -10...-25...-50....-80.... It was an elevator to hell. That's what BrBa is. It's in the name, after all. No matter how tough do you think the situation where the protagonists find themselves in is - the worst is yet to come. It's not even seasons... it's almost like every episode is a floor down... to the last episode's abyss.<br/><br/>The cast is stellar. I mean, sure, there are some prime Hollywood stars that you can just put into anything and that'd be it, like Freeman, Willis, Depp etc, and I wouldn't say that I'd chase the cast of this show wherever else they'd star in. Well, maybe Cranston, he deserves that much. But the cast did their roles, and did them incredibly. Now, almost every character is unlikeable. In fact... only the secondary character are likeable. Steve Gomez, Gus, Lydia... Pretty much the entire main cast are basically mutations of humanity. There's Walter's wife, who really does an excellent job of being the least loving wife imaginable, let alone caring mother. There's their son, who tries his best to be sweet, but who is, after all, a literal r-tard. It's in the script. The DEA brother-in-law, Hank, a piece of work that really goes beyond even his pathetic agency, his wife, basically a mental criminal, who needs separation from society and placement into an asylum, but who is, after all, "family" and who is married to a DEA agent... I'm glad they don't have kids. This pair... deserves to be sterile. But no matter how terrible they are, Jesse, one of the protagonists, takes the cake.<br/><br/>Now, there were two actresses, whom I hated. Well, I mean, hated their characters. Because they were just too good. Marcia Harden from Mist... made the movie, which is quite basic by itself, pretty much unwatchable. Really incredible acting. And Kate Mara. The faces she made in FF2015 and Transcendence... You can't look at them without wanting to him her. Especially because she is female. But Aaron Paul... man. This guy... I'm not sure I'll be able to watch anything else he'd star in. Even that upcoming BrBa movie, if he'll be the lead. I... I really hate his character. He just gets the cake. The absolute monstrosity. The real villain. Hiding in plain sight. It wasn't Gus. It wasn't Walter or Hank. It was Jesse. And no, this isn't a spoiler, this is merely an opinion.<br/><br/>He went from being useless to more useless, from a mess to an even bigger mess. Somewhere in the middle of the show, when he sort of "steeled" himself - I thought they are going to develop him into something. Nope. Still a pathetic, useless shamble. A waste of life, literally. No lessons learned, ever. No effort, no effect. I mean, sure, there were a couple of moments with Gus, where he has sort of done something. I guess the writing can account to that much. But beyond that - he was the absolute antithesis of Walter. No matter what they do to Walter - he is an old man. He goes through hell so much that Dante would tip his hat. Yet he, from the beginning to the end... cares. He has an agenda, and this agenda is love.<br/><br/>Hank... he's an animal. A pig, a proper choice of an actor. Just literally a pig sniffling out his treat. Meticulous, narrow-minded, selfish. For a moment I hoped they'd develop him into anything resembling a human. But no... And yet, even foregoing Hank - Jesse is the real antithesis. A person, who cares for nobody. Well, he does get tantrums about children... not that he ever wants to make one, not unlike Hank. But beyond these tantrums - he is an empty shell. There is no loyalty, no care, no reason, no love, no logic, no comprehension. From the very first episode to the very last - his on-screen purpose is to be a parasite to Walter. A literal parasite.<br/><br/>Of course, the writing is sloppy. You can see the cracks from the very first season. Gilligan did a lot of work, and it is commendable, and I wouldn't do it any better, and that's something you can't say about most Oscar-winning movies nowadays. But still.... he had to tie just SO many loose ends, so many stories. Every character, every detail, every action - needed a consequence, if not a backstory. And so you begin to see the forced writing. I mean, obviously in the real world Hank's first guess would be Walter, come on. Doesn't take a genius. And even then - all of the "solutions" to their problems were forced. Krazy8's plate, Tuco's family\house, Gus' relationship with the Cartel... It's not documentary, but you see how many things are just "too much" of a coincidence.<br/><br/>And it's the worst in the last season. From Walter basically "Dark Knight Rising" himself across the country... to "book" that just happened to be... there... to that... pack of cigarettes... I mean, wow. Poor Gilligan really had to tie up everything and within a schedule. And I'll admit, again, he did it fine. Few shows and movies can brag about a proper ending, and I'd say I'm satisfied. It just felt a bit rushed. While, obviously, the story goes down stage by stage, and it couldn't overlap... "something" could've been done to make it more coherent. Less things left to chance, more things actually discussed or dealt with.<br/><br/>But then again, you realize two moments: "everyone lies". And Walter often makes a complete fool of himself, and I don't mean his "certain moments", forcing an unpleasant outcome. So when everyone lies - you can't seek reason or logic. When Jesse doesn't think, learn or improve, EVER... There is no other way. It could've been written better, but could it really have ended better, without dislodging the narrative? No. It is... Breaking Bad. And you can't break something bad without... breaking it.<br/><br/>Still, if there was something I'd give 10 stars without looking back - that's BrBa. Perhaps the last thing I should add - is how well the director operated, the style of the show. It's all.. REAL. I mean, I remember only once scene where CGI or special effects were used... you know, the Face-off. But other than that? It's all actually real. Filmed not on some 8k IMAX Red Digital Cinema. And such directing, coupled with proper writing and, again, stellar acting - makes this show actually palpable. That's something you really, really miss with modern movies, even Oscar ones. Everything is shot with green screen, stunt doubles, quality is replaced with CGI, writing - with pandering to the lowest common denominator. The fear of a 50 IQ kid\adult not understanding something, and thus requesting a ticket refund - is way bigger than the fear of making a joke of a picture. A joke can sell for a billion, Marvel can attest to that. But a work of art? Eh, it could rot in hell with all those 50 IQ kids not understanding it.<br/><br/>This show is not afraid to be brutal, depressing, nihilistic, outright burdening. I'm not sure fans of most shows\movies would like it, regardless of age. That is - I wouldn't mind showing it to a 10-year-old kid, assuming that this kid is raised properly. Because it would be a great lesson. But I'm not sure about showing it to my aging mother. She likes Vikings and stuff like that, semi-historic with dress-up and special effects. But for something to go dark, like pitch dark... Hell, even my friend of the same age doesn't quite feel like continuing to watch. And I can't blame him... but I can blame Jesse. That sonnova... Amazing, this serial show how a dad can make everything for his family This show has such a stirring concept. Though dark and twisted. The overall question, "What makes a good man a bad man", stirs up so many complex conversations that I could discuss for hours. The way it makes you think is so moving. As I watched, I found myself in the shoes of so many characters and was able to broaden my perspective on so many issues the show touched on. Thus why I am rating the show with 10/10 stars. I loved this show and if you haven't watched it yet why are you still reading this, go watch for yourself!!! Overwhelmed by the intensity of this series. Best ever ! This show is amazing. I'm on my third time watching it and it is rare I could EVER watch an entire series more than once. I have learned more with each watch through. This show is genius. Walter White is a sociopath and his rise and fall is very intriguing to watch. Screw it, it's a 10 in my book! If you havent seen this show yet, start it up Bitch!!!
One of the best series i have ever seen, brilliant acting from Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul
Cant tell too much about the story but its convincing and very good<br/><br/>Humour,action and suspense
5 seasons of pure entertainment, you see a good man breaking bad, entering a world he doesnt know in the beginning
But he does it all for his family........................and his ego :P Never have I ever been so immersed and attached to a television series such as Breaking Bad ðŸ™Œ
The story line is among the greatest, the cast absolutely fit in their roles, the scripting & direction of the series was something to behold. This is the greatest TV series of all time!! This is a stellar show that you should not pass up. I watched it without my wife, as she was not interested. After I finished watching it, I told her she HAD to watch it.....when she did, she beause addicted to it, too.<br/><br/>The entire cast is great, but CRANSTON owns this - you believe every change he goes through - no matter how small the change may be- he is a most amazing actor. He carries this series to a higher high.<br/><br/>My wife said she was even sad when she finished watching this series. I told her she would love it, and she surely did! Quite simply the best series I have ever watched, it takes a little while to get into, but stay with it and you will not be disappointed Bryan Cranston is the best actor on this show but I have got to say Aaron Paul comes profoundly close to being nearly as good as Cranston, both of their characters are are amazing and what complete this show of course along with all of the other actors. Wooow! Stop! Im emotionaly broken and very sad. This Show was the best Show i have ever seen! You cant compare it with any other series. The performances of the Actors are really really good + the writing and music of this series. This Show deserves more than 16 Emmys. When i think about this Show i think like i have to cry. This Show was more of just a Show.this series has moved me emotionally and spiritually into the spell. Whenever I hear the music or when I start to watch small parts on Youtube I find it very sad that I can not see this series again for the first time and I will never forget my feelings after the finale (S05 / 16 "Felina") . Im shocked. Pure gold...... Watch and enjoy! Walter White shines throughout the entire season. Breaking Bad is without a doubt a show that deserves the 10/10 rating. Everything about it is just incredible right from the very beginning of the show (with a fantastic pilot) and never breaks down in its scenic drive to the finish. The show has a unique use of cinematography, story and a fantastic soundtrack but where the story really shines from most other shows is in how real these characters and world feels along with how the show never forgets about the consequences of the character's actions and how they can never truly get away with what they did in their past.<br/><br/>In this way, the writing is some of best in film or television, every character never loses track of who they are and their personalities even as these horrible things happen to them or their loved ones throughout the whole show. Every character is just fantastically thought out, written and incredibly well acted. You never feel as if they are just actors playing characters for even one second, they always seem to embody that person which makes the drama and crime even more emotional, disturbing and gut-punching.<br/><br/>There's nothing bad I could really say about the show apart from maybe some episodes in series 1 were a tiny bit slow (which is totally made up for in how it is just setting up the premise/characters) and that some of the science early on isn't entirely realistic (which you wouldn't notice that much if you don't practice chemistry) but that's only a minor nit-pick that doesn't effect the rest of the show.<br/><br/>The show just feels unique in how gripping and disturbed the balance between the disturbing nature of bad versus worse (there's no real good guys) and how no one really wins in this type of situation. The DEA can't beat the cartel and the cartel can't get the DEA off their back. It's a perfect anti-villain show and character drama that never loses a sense of the story and thriller elements. It's not just focused on making one thing good, it focuses on making everything great from it's characters, story progression, writing, cinematography and acting, it fully deserves to be classified as a near perfect show.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this, watch this show, it is absolutely fantastic. You can watch one a night, you can binge watch it like I did but no matter which way, it is just a great experience and character study. I just watched for the first time it in 2019
You need to but Just because you intend to do good, doesn't mean you will.
A person is not bad, just because they do bad actions, and a person is not crazy, if they do crazy actions.<br/><br/>Such is the story of breaking bad. A crime fantasy that everyone has atleast once thought of. Yet the greatest horror someone with a family could ever dream of.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I loved the show, and admire it. In each and every department this movie is a milestone. I don't see any possibility of watching anything better than this one in the near future. Watching this one is my life time experience. I just wish this movie never ends. Please bring it to us again by hook or crook!!! And Bryan Cranston........... I owe you for my lifetime and I can definitely tell you that you are "The Best Actor". The show you pulled off with this is the all time best. Other characters were also felt real, original or even better than original....WOW............ no body will ever beat this, I can bet...............BEST OF THE BESTS!!!!!!!! This is considered as one of the greatest television shows of history. Critics and fans alike love this show.<br/><br/>Me personally was blown away by it.<br/><br/>It is created by one of the "X-Files" creators, so there is no surprise.<br/><br/>But this is one of the most uniquely dark television drama on a man's journey to perdition and we see it's inception.<br/><br/>We see madness, internal struggle, violence and drugs.<br/><br/>This reminds of Tarantino, Rodriguez, Ritchie and Joe Carnahan. A dark comic take on violence.<br/><br/>Bryan Cranston as Walter White is amazing. One of the best television experiences so far.<br/><br/>Overall - 4/5 One of the best shows I've watched but it's not for the faint of heart. It has some really slow spots and odd pacing at times. The characters are solid by and far. Some scenes are hard to watch due to the content. There are a number of shots that are remarkable in terms of the cinematography. Overall the show is very well done. No words to describe
It will just blow you mind
..<br/><br/><br/><br/>. Best TV series I've ever seen!!! Cast is beyond fantastic,story,thrill,light,camera,music,.... This is what we call A Masterpiece must see show!!! Amazing turns of events and great performances
A masterpiece of art Without Second Thought This is My Most Favorite Web Series So far ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ Whattaa Performances ðŸ™ŒðŸ™Œ Breaking Bad One Word : F A N T A S T I C ðŸ’•ðŸ’• Amazing contentcvvvvv xdthvnn ugcdseff<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>ghgdft<br/><br/><br/><br/>jkj Brilliant story, amazing characters, plot twits that will personally affect you, realistic and riveting script, excellent acting, relatable characters, amazing cinematography, creative directing-- this show is just a masterpiece!<br/><br/>The show is slow paced at some parts, but this show is still a gold mine.<br/><br/>Highly recommended: watch Better Call Saul if you still have a hangover from this show. Breaking Bad is definitely the best show ever made. The show follows Walter White as he is transformed from a meek high school science teacher who wants to provide for his family after learning he has terminal cancer into a ruthless player in the local methamphetamine drug trade. Initially making only small batches of meth with his former student Jesse Pinkman, Walter and Jesse eventually expand to make larger batches of a special blue meth that is incredibly pure and creates high demand. Walter takes on the name "Heisenberg" to mask his identity. Because of his drug-related activities, Walt eventually finds himself at odds with his family, the Drug Enforcement Agency through his brother-in-law Hank Schrader, the local gangs, and the Mexican drug cartels and their regional distributors, putting his life at risk.<br/><br/>If you haven't watched it yet it's a must. I give Breaking Bad 10/10 cause it's awesome! I first watched this series 3 years ago and was totally blown away by it. It truly deserves every accolade that has been bestowed upon it. How it sucks you in to every scene and makes you love or hate a character whether you want to or not, makes this the greatest thing ever to grace a tv or cinema screen.
When I got to the end of the whole series, I wished it could go on and on for ever but I knew it had to come to a conclusion sometime - otherwise what's the point of a film of tv show I suppose. But fear not - because if you haven't seen it in a while, watch the whole thing again. You will be pleasantly suprised how much you may have missed or misunderstood the first time around and it actually felt like I was watching it for the first time! What's so crazy about this show is that each season gets better than the previous which literally never happens with TV. In fact, my favorite episode is in the final three episodes of the last season. This kind of TV comes around once in a generation. It is as addictive as the substance they create in the show. <br/><br/>Every line, beat and thought is so perfectly thought through that it's exact definition of the sublime. <br/><br/>I don't think any review will ever do this show justice, it is just one of those things that no matter who you are or what kind of TV you like, you must watch BB. It will enhance your life but also leave you with a hole, which very few TV shows will ever be able to fill. And that's OK, because you will have experienced this, and therefore life is complete. The writers, directors, who ever came up with the plot, the character designs, the epic scenes, every angle i try to look at this show from, it's always damn near perfect! This is one of those shows that makes the audience feel smarter as their watching, in Breaking Bad the writing and acting are so technical, everything feels answered at the end. It's a very serious show but its aesthetic thru-out is just so engaging with the audience. The writers and directors did such a good job of just letting all the important characters progress, and from a birds eye view, looking at this show from start to finish, makes it a show like none other. I watched 5 seasons twice!
I think this is the best tv show ever! Long story short - if you have not seen this incredible TV show yet you have to watch it immediately! It is really that great!<br/><br/>It is so amazing to watch how Walter breaks bad during the series and how he manipulates with the ones he claims he loves and destroy everything he loved.
Vince Gilligan wrote a perfect TV series.<br/><br/>And oh my god, the last episode! Every final episodes in all TV shows should name Felina from now on. It will blow up your mind till the end of the series . One of the best series watched
Perfect acting skills by Bryan Cranston and Paul , thus all were superb. At starting you should have skme patience then you will get a fruit perfectly Grown a masterpiece.
A must watch TV series a classic series.
Love to watch series like that .
This type a series once or twice in a decade. Every element of this show leaves me awestruck. Over the top performances, spectacular cinematography, mind blowing plot and steady pace with faster ending makes this an all time favorite. Vince Gilligan and Bryan Cranston are respective geniuse. Huge round of applaud for the greatest show ever made! This show captured my attentionspan within 5 minutes of watching. Just amazing. Having been introduced to Breaking Bad on Sunday, I now find myself watching back to back episodes of the programme as soon as I've finished work, I watch solidly until 12 midnight and up again at 5am for work. No other tv goes on. Thankfully all my soaps are being recorded. <br/><br/>Great programme...A must watch! This is the best series I've ever seen. An amazing story, drama, crime scenes and direction. Great performance by Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul, Giancarlo Esposoto, Anna Gunn, Dean Norris. Every season finale is epic. This show is one of the greatest of all time. The story is incredible; the character development, acting and cinematography are all spot on. I'm really glad they decided to end this show gracefully rather than try to drag it out and ruin it like with others I've loved. 10/10 well done. I watch this show all the way every couple years, it's really well written, shot and acted. You will be on the edge of your seat from the get go.<br/><br/>It dips a bit around season three and picks up again before s3 ends, this is needed in order to stretch it out a bit because it is often very interesting and an intense watch. Nearly flawless. Words not enough to write this review. This thing just builds on you and in the end gets you. At the end of the day it is fiction but it has been portraid is such fashion that you like it more than reality. There are benchmarks being set by almost all the characters. Lots of TV shows come and go. Most of them go unnoticed. Very few TV shows manage to make an impact on the audience and out of those few some never leave your mind because they're just too good.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad is a show that will forever remain unforgotten and unparalleled because of its unique concept and also the brilliantly written plot and characters.<br/><br/>The character of Walter White itself is the highlight. I don't remember the last time I was so impressed with a character from a TV show. The way his character develops throughout the seasons is just wonderful. Bryan Cranston was absolutely wonderful in his portayal as the high school chemistry teacher turned crime boss.<br/><br/>Aaron Paul as his dimwitted and emotionally troubled assistant was also very good.<br/><br/>Overall this show is one of a kind and I've seen several shows trying to match up to this one but they failed miserably and eventually shut down. I enjoyed each and every bit of this show mainly because of the plot, brilliantly written characters and fantastic performances by the lead characters. It's no wonder it's the greatest show of all time. Loved it, if you haven't seen it, start watching now! TV series usually start pretty good then start to get worse season after season. But Breaking Bad, on the contrary, every season is better than the one before it. It's an amazing show, interesting, mind blowing, full of plot twists, emotions and action, and you can totally binge watch it! All the episodes are out and available on Netflix and other streaming services, and i guarantee you that you won't get bored. I'd totally recommend it for you to watch it, I give it a solid 9.5/10, it's my favorite show (after Game Of Thrones). What are you waiting for? Go start it ! Season 1: seems nice
Rest of the series: HOLY FRICKIN SH** WHAT JUST HAPPENED<br/><br/>That was basically my reaction during thw whole series while I watched it, this series have one of the best characters I've ever seen in my life and I LOVED IT with my life An unbelievably perfect plot. With each episode the series improves to reach a legendary and undeniable level in the last two seasons! Innovative and Perfect. This show was absolutely brilliant. Wonderfully written and beautifully carried out by the actors. I was hooked after just the first episode and could NOT stop binge watching. There is never not a time when it's boring in any way, it kept my attention throughout. Truly an "edge of your seat" kind of show, and that's just an understatement. Watch it now!!! And be prepared to have lots of spare time as you will definitely want to binge watch. The best TV series of all time, there are no words ... Masterpiece!
"It is life, first it is growth, then decay and then again transformation" 
<ul><li>Walter White</li></ul> This was such a dramatic show that had you feeling for the characters until the end. Some parts were a little tedious but they made up for it in other ways like the elaborate plans and over the top characters that were cast to their roles perfectly. The amazing makeup and costume designs were always perfectly executed and clever in what they represented. In my opinion this is THE BEST show ever made! There is not much left to say, but O really need to say that this is a genius and rare creation. Absolutely overwhealming and unexpected. Contains everything in a perfect dose, drama, suspense, comedy, horror and absolutely indelible performances. Unmissable. Everyone should watch this cinematic masterpiece at least once in their lifetime. Brilliant series that is a 100% certified must watch.<br/><br/>My only grip? Well I'm sorry to say, its Jessie. Some people love him. I hate him. His character is whiney, childish and irritating throughout. No other show has had the same impact on me as Breaking Bad did. It is literally a perfect show. I remember staying up till 3 am every night even though I had work the next day! Needless to say I was addicted to the show and was devastated when I finished it. I wish I could watch it all over again for the first time..Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul and Vince Gilligan, take a bow.. Breaking Bad is a show about two men deciding to make crystal meth, but what is magical about the story premise is that is what it feels like watching Breaking Bad. You can not help but be hooked and want to watch more and more and more and more. Aaron Paul is phenomenal as Jesse Pinkman, Pinkman is very, very dumb, but he is so lovable and despite being a drug dealer still stands up for what is right at times. The amazing thing about Jesse Pinkman is that he clearly he has a consciousness when it comes to killing people or ruining people's lives. He does not mind when they are drug dealers, but when they are good, normal people he cares and stands up for what he believes in. Cranston is amazing as suburban husband and teacher Walter White. The audience sees White morph from a wonderful, thoughtful husband into a cruel, callous drug lord. White becomes an entirely different person and even gives himself a new name for this new persona, but I will not spoil that. The writing is absolutely superb, the only bad episode that I can remember is called "The Bug". Breaking Bad may be the best show of all time, but that has to be one of the worst episodes in the history of tv shows. Please skip that episode, but otherwise it is absolutely amazing. I watched this show for the first time at a very young age and it definitely had an impact on me as to whom is involved in the drug world and erased any curiousness I had as to how drugs would make me feel. I suggest this for teenagers, adults, or anybody who wants to watch amazing television while discouraging drug use at the same time. Breaking Bad definitely does not glorify the world of drugs, it simply states what the drug world is like. Please, please watch it, you most certainly will not regret it! Watch it for for every cast member...Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul are superb in this Vince Gilligan Masterpiece... It really wow series it one of the most beautiful things that humanity ever make Heard "Those who understand the movies/series in deep they often cry", I cried in most of the episodes. It was so emotional for me. He does a great sacrifice for the sake of his family. Last episodes was very emotional. I am happy in watching every season and episodes but season 5 last episodes , i m not satisfied. I feel like does it an end of breaking bad????I feel like its should never have an end.It should be continued ...... Years passed since I watched Breaking Bad and it is still my favorite show. A truly masterpiece really well developed The show has put up clear eyed characterization, acting, plot twists and black humour. Breaking Bad embraced the chaos. Heisenberg for the win. Starting with the story, when you hear about a drug dealer makes drugs "methamphetamine" and kills souls, you will hate him without knowing him of course, and here comes the philosophy of the writer and the way he writes which made me sympathized with that durg dealar in this series and with the other side at the same time, that thing revealed to me how the writer is genius !!<br/><br/>The superb thing in this series when it comes to the writing is each and every character had their own impact on the story in a way or another, the writer put so many details to make sure that "death isn't the end" so that even if the character dies it's affect will appear in the series sooner or later ..<br/><br/>And the last thing is the family, the great message that made me fall in love with this series is the family in which the main character of the series became a drug dealer and he knows that thing is illegal but he did it just for his family so when he dies he will ensure his family future and even if he died his family will always remember him and what he did for them.. for me that message was enough to make this series one of the best in tv history.. This is undoubtedly the best series I've ever watched , the characters were originally just some infamous guys , but they gathered together to give us on of the best performances if not the best , whenever you start it I insure you that you'll watch all the episodes in a row. A little wink there for GOT fans, hehe. All my love to you brothers!
So, speaking of this specific work of art, I would say entertainment rarely comes with such compelling story, script, actors, drama, direction, intrigue, turns and twists, outcomes and begginings as this.
Many have said it and many others will stand for it: Breaking Bad is point break of an era of TV.
Enjoyable experiences as good as it gets. Wow this show is the best of all time is gets better and better This show is the best every episode gets better and better Heukskskksskskksksksk kskskkdkdkdk<br/><br/>Kskskkskdk flekkfjerning land ID k dl DnK. Finland d This beautiful piece of art is incredibly well written and directed, furthermore the actors are doing a tremendous job! The plot line is great... the acting is good... it has all the makings for a great show but for me it was just so dark and depressing I can't call it a favorite. Easily the best show ever
it was a little bit slow at the start but it gets better every epsode Ever since the first episode I was hooked on to this series. I got to say, this series revealed a lot of honest, savage and ugly side of being human. I have to thank the creators of this show for this show, I have learned a lot. Grate Story, Fabulous Acting, Super Strong Scripting allover its too good the best i ever saw, and most impotent Became more and more crazy and thrilling after every episode . There are shows that I loved in the beginning and shows that I loved by the end. Breaking Bad was one of the few shows I loved all the way through. 
The first episode immediately grabbed my attention and the constant forward momentum of the storytelling never faltered as the series progressed. <br/><br/>What ranks the show so highly in my books is the way it set up high stakes drama right from the out-set. Not only do we have the story of a man with cancer trying to provide for his family by cooking crystal meth (a fantastic and original premise in itself), we also have the story of a man who's trying to survive the criminal underworld and avoid being caught by his DEA brother in law at the same time. 
This provided a constant source of tension which continued to escalate throughout the shows 5 seasons. <br/><br/>When that tension is finally released in the final seasons mid season finale (the show had done an amazing job at maintaining it for the four and a half seasons prior), an even more sinister conflict then arises which is even more adrenaline inducing. I honestly loved the final season the most because it felt like everything was leading up to those final events. They saved the best until last in my opinion.<br/><br/>I also felt that this show was extremely well planned out. They had a story to tell and they knew exactly when to end it. <br/><br/>And then of course you have the icing on the cake: the acting, the scripts, the direction and overall execution which, as I mentioned, was top notch. 
Definitely go and watch this show if you can. You won't regret it! Though I may be very late (more than 4 years); but as soon as i got into the show, I watched the entire 62 episodes within a fortnight. Such an impressive job was done by the stellar cast, especially Bryan Cranston aka Walter White (also known as Heisenberg), that now I treat his character as a real life person out of fiction.
The way he comes to know about his inoperable lung cancer and considering how much troubled his life was at beginning of season 1, it was pretty much clear that he had to do something off the charts to earn huge amount of money before he dies(to provide for his family). Here enters the other half of famed duo, Jesse Pinkman. He's a former student of Mr. White who is completely into drugs.Both of them are imperfect but are in sync when doing their common job i.e. coooking meth. Walter, being highly qualified chemistry high school teacher, makes purest meth which even surprises DEA. Everyone is after his famed 'Blue Sky' meth and the sales department is under Jesse. As we later progress into the series Walt and Jesse face many obstacles and enemies like Tuco Salamanca, Gus Fring , a Neo-Nazi group and even Walt's own DEA agent brother-in-law Hank Schrader.
But Mr. White outsmarts everyone, either by trickery or total chaotic violence.
At the end Walter dies , but on his own terms. I heard many great things about this show. People claimed it to be one of the best shows on television. After seeing it, I must say that this television series is a pure masterpiece. The acting, writing, directing, camerawork, sound design & music, editing, and every other aspect of this show is executed flawlessly. This is more than a television series; this is a piece of art. Vince Gilligan has hailed himself as a genius by meticulously crafting this perfect series. I absolutely recommend this to anyone. I'm not exaggerating when I say this is the best television series of all time. To me, the ending of a TV series is a very important thing. Many great shows fail in the ending which doesn't make them remember long. <br/><br/>But in case of Breaking Bad, the story building from season 1 to season 5, character development, the inevitable fate of these characters, friends and family of Walter White make this show even more memorable. As a complete ended TV series BB is still the best. No matter how good Game Of Thrones is, the ending will tell the difference of greatness between GOT and BB..... Who hasn't watched Breaking Bad? it has become a cult show in so many countries at a level that hasn't happened before. Everyone says that it's great, that no other show can top it, and they are right, but why is it?<br/><br/>How can someone not like a guy, a chemistry teacher in his fifties, who looks at his life and says "fuck it" and starts cooking meth, in the same way we like the character of Kevin Spacey in American Beauty. He kills the monotony in his life, which makes the plot full of possibilities in many aspects of the story.<br/><br/>The most important trait of Breakin Bad is the originality of everything. It doesn't have a source material. Everything looks fresh, with no clichÃ©s and no trite elements. And if you are a movie buff you may have caught some references to classic movies, especially, Tarantino's movies.<br/><br/>Each episode is powerful, filled with emotions and character development, interesting dialogues, and situations of all type. Every character, every scene, every dialogue, every shot is meaningful for the whole of the story. <br/><br/>From episode one to the final episode the series reached a climax, and level of expectancy never reached by any other TV show.<br/><br/>I've watched breaking bad three times, and I've always found some new deep peculiar meanings in the plot. <br/><br/>I have no doubt that this is the best TV show of all time. "Breaking Bad" is the best television show. Ever.<br/><br/>We start out with one main character, Walter White (played by Bryan Cranston), who is struggling to make ends meet working both as a high school chemistry teacher and part-time at a car wash. Then he gets diagnosed with cancer. Then he breaks bad.<br/><br/>Teaming up with an unlikely sidekick, Jesse Pinkman (played by Aaron Paul), who is the immature "yo, bitch"-spouting, high-school-screw- up small-time drug dealer, Walt, and Jesse both put their skills towards the drug world to try to make good by their families.<br/><br/>This show has been masterfully put together with layer upon layer of insight into some of the most interesting characters ever realized in the history of television. We have some very dark characters and a lot of Grey characters, and it all adds up to brilliant dialogue and plot lines.<br/><br/>The creator, writers, directors, and actors have paid attention to every single detail, putting thought into every nuance in every character in every scene. Because of this attention to detail, there is something for everyone in this show. Every thinking brain will immediately be attracted to the intelligence so evidently on display, that even if you're not a drug dealing chemist living in Albuquerque, you will find something in the characters that connects you to them and makes you hang on for dear life.<br/><br/>Get on your couch now and start watching "Breaking Bad" from the very beginning, and don't miss a single scene.<br/><br/>My Favorite Dialogue:"You clearly don't know who you're talking to, so let me clue you in. I am not in danger, Skyler. I am the danger. A guy opens his door and gets shot, and you think that of me? No! I am the one who knocks!" "Breaking Bad" is the best television show.

For me, Breaking Bad deserves to be named the best TV series ever. Like seriously, how does one get to shoot perfection such as this? I cried in some parts of the show because I just couldn't imagine what was going through the writer's head when the plot was written.<br/><br/>The show's intoxicating and for me, it's simply perfection. I've never really been able to binge watch TV shows, I lack the attention span and usually get bored, often opting to watch 1 or 2 episodes of a show a day... then I started watching Breaking Bad, and my god was I hooked! I ended up finishing the whole series in about a week. From beginning to end I found Breaking Bad to be an entertaining thrill ride. I often hear people say the show doesn't really pick up until Season 2, but I was hooked after the first 2 episodes, I found Season 1 to be equally entertaining as 2, 3, 4 and 5! The show of course picks up the pace as the series goes on, rewarding viewers with thrilling suspenseful finales each season and some of the most memorable one liners, speeches and *POTENTIAL SPOILER* plenty of shocking character deaths! There wasn't a dull moment, even slower episodes I now realize were completely necessary to set up some of the groundwork for later reveals and action sequences. Fully recommend this to everyone! In short, watch the show. I've thrown up the spoiler tag because I don't even wanna hint at what this show is about if you haven't already seen it. If you want more of a critique and review of the show, keep reading! Breaking Bad is, and probably will remain the best television show I've ever seen. I could talk for days about just why this show is so damn good, but having watched the show through about half a dozen times now, I can articulate EXACTLY why its the best show around and why it probably will remain the best show around. Breaking Bad is CONSISTENT and HONEST with itself. It's a crime show, it's a drama, it's a pitch black comedy, but most importantly, it's a show about a guy, a guy who we know is gotta change, but just how far he's going to change, well... I guess we'll just have to watch. Chances are if you've watched a television show from 2010 on you've seen Breaking Bad. I say this because Breaking Bad really capitalized on character drama, specifically that of an anti-hero and a nefarious rise to power (turns out this was a market most networks didn't even think about). Vince Gilligan and crew had a mighty task ahead of them when crafting a show like this: "If Walt's gonna become an evil guy, how are you gonna get folks to root for him?" You make it honest. You cast an unlikely villain too. Often a subject of jokes in it's earlier seasons, everyone only knows of Bryan Cranston from the outlandish performance in Malcolm in the Middle. Try to remember that when you get to season 5. Breaking Bad doesn't paint an unrealistic portrait of a drug kingpin, but rather a man in a dance with fire praying to God that he doesn't get burned. Walt plays a dangerous game in this show, from his humble beginnings of "just one cook" to "just this much money" eventually get wrapped into "we have to get rid of Tuco" to "we have to get rid of Gus" to "I'm in the empire business". We stick with Walt all the way through because the show is honest with us. It's a slow burn to be sure but it's one that we believe, and more importantly, it's one that we trust. Looking back on the show I realize that to some degree, I was willing to let the poisoning of Brock slide simply because I wanted so badly for Walt to make it. That's good writing. That's good acting. That's INCREDIBLE pacing. The real surprise heart of the show is in fact in the side kick, Jesse Pinkman (hats off to Aaron Paul who really delivers in this show). If Walt's change is that to go from good to bad, Jesse's is much more focused on heartless to caring. I could speak volumes to Aaron Paul's performance here but I wanna focus back on the show as a whole: The title of this summary is Lightning in a Bottle. This show is consistent. You know from the first episode Walt has cancer. It's going to end, it's just a matter of time. I give this show a 10/10, but that does not mean it isn't without its flaws. I think season 3 is kind of a drag. It's good. I know why its there. It's all building for the eventual topping and emotional payoff of seasons 4 and 5. Unfortunately I'm an American, which means I can't go more than 60 seconds without a wink, nod, one liner, or an explosion to keep me invested (only kind of). I think Marie is just not that interesting a character. Early on she gets some attention, a problem that Hank often has to intervene, thus giving screen time, thus slowing down the pacing (something about stealing spoons in an open house tour just isn't as captivating as running a meth empire on Walt's end). Tuco's cousins are my least favorite part of the show. They're hinted at when Walt and Jesse are captured, a force from south of the border will come along and kill Walt and everyone he loves. They are intimidating... but at the same time... they're kind of comical. They're these "silent badass" dudes, hit men for the Cartel. They're given some depth but these clowns just feel laughably one dimensional. But they're important, they really affect the story. I guess I just wish they weren't crafted to be so stereotypical (at one point they even walk away from an explosion). But Breaking Bad is more than the sum of its parts. There is no perfect show, but this is damn near close. I cannot recommend Breaking Bad enough. It's a classical story, of a good man turned bad, but oh man is this show creative. Thank you Vince Gilligan. Thank you for giving us this magnificent work. This is not the best TV-series ever this is the best piece of cinematic experience you will ever have its just not as simple as mr chips turns scarface its about pride ,lies ,regret , anguish, greed, indulgence, making choices its about breaking bad its about a man with cancer who is dying but in an attempt to gather 737 grand for his family takes the whole drug syndicate in albuquerque from bosses to manufactures to distributors to soldiers down with him (on trip to belize as saul goodman says) I Like this show, This show is beautifully written with plot twists coming in refreshing ways, and at just the right times. Some of what is shown I was surprised they put it on television,... and that's a great thing !! The acting is brilliant, and the themes are amazing, timeless and timely, and are presented to us in thought provoking ways that leave me pondering philosophical ideas long after the show is over.<br/><br/>Only GOT can compete with it for me. Wow, congratulations to all the staff, the writers, the directors, the actors that made possible to create this unique emotional experience. Thank you Netflix giving me this opportunity. I am surprised about the strong content and message to all of us audience. I enjoyed every part of it with dramatic and unexpected turns. There are many interesting details from the drug scene. They are developed and shown very professionally that I have never seen before in other thrillers of this genre. Check this out. It is a great entertainer that you won't forget for the rest of your life. This is why it deserves 10/10. Walter White is the salt and pepper - innocent man, two masks, cruel and merciful in the same body. Great acting, Bryan! Pinkman, typical person you HAVE to avoid doing business with. The actors' attitude and acting is top, combined for an exceptional realistic film series. My well recommendation to watch this series. Brilliant! Intelligent, original and interesting story. Great acting. Logic in its own universe. Metaphorical and matter-of-fact at the same time. Simple and complex at the same time. I watched it twice and kept finding new reasons to love it. What other TV or movie can make buying a plastic container in Home Depot or installing a water heater actually interesting? It is the simplicity of the normal life that makes it so believable. Unlike other shows where one someone is "smart" you just have to believe they are. Here they SHOW you why they are smart. Actions have consequences. Godfather-like, except for 65 hours which, like a long classic book, I loved so much! Breaking Bad, in addition to being one of the best shows ever, is also one of the easiest to love. Never before have I seen a show that seems to have everything you could want. It has the fiery explosions, the gruesome death, and the quotable lines of "Game of Thrones." It has the brilliant dark humor of "The Sopranos." It has the quiet character study of "Six Feet Under." It's recommendable to pretty much anyone, whether you're the type who wants awesomeness and explosions, hilarious dark comedy, or (and this one is me) quiet, brilliant character drama.<br/><br/>How it managed to combine all that is beyond me. If you're able to look past the fact that it's built on what seems like an unrealistic premise (but is actually very realistic once you get to know Walt's backstory), and will often sacrifice hyper-realism for better drama (unlike "The Wire," which sacrifices better drama for hyper-realism), and the fact that, it can, at times, seem a tad stifled in its writing, you'll find what is, without doubt, one of the great shows to ever hit television.<br/><br/>It should be said now, and forever, that "Breaking Bad" is the best- acted show on television. I truly hope people aren't still arguing about that. You can point to any regular member of the cast, and find at least three episodes for which they deserved an Emmy. For certain members, like Cranston, Gunn, and Paul, you can point to pretty much ANY episode and see an Emmy-worthy performance. That can't be said for any other show. Cranston, in particular, gives what is hands-down the greatest performance in television history, and in "Crawl Space," possibly gives the best performance in the HISTORY OF ACTING. Think I'm exaggerating? Get to season 4, episode 11, and you'll understand that I'm not exaggerating at all.<br/><br/>Then, there is another trademark of superiority for this show, something that can rarely be said, and that is the brilliance of the directors of this show. Whether it's "Pilot," directed by Vince Gilligan, subtle but near perfect, or "One Minute," directed by Michelle MacLaren, the best directing television's seen since the first episode of "Lost," or "Hermanos," "Crawl Space," or "Ozymandias," all giving subtle-but-brilliant moments in directing, or the brilliant "Felina," which (and to this day, I'm impressed by this) makes Walt seems about a foot shorter than he actually is, because of the framing, which, given the context, couldn't be more appropriate.<br/><br/>Then, there's the music selection, which may seem unimportant, but is quite great. Whether it's the original soundtrack, masterfully constructed, heart-pounding, or heartbreaking, or the songs they choose, such as "Crystal Blue Persuasion," "The Hole," "Baby Blue," and fifteen others, all of which are positively perfect for each situation.<br/><br/>And the writing, though I criticized it earlier, rightfully, at other times can be some of the best in television. "Gray Matter" sees Walt's fantastic pillow speech, "Grilled" Tuco's insanity, "4 Days Out" the humor the show is capable of while remaining dramatic still, "Ozymandias" the art of the downfall, "Felina" the perfect conclusion, "Crawl Space" the cruelty of Gus Fring, and (UNPOPULAR OPINION), "Fly," one of the best episodes, because of the humor, and it proves itself to be, on multiple viewings, one of the funniest episodes of television ever.<br/><br/>And then, there's the fact that it produced "Ozymandias," which is, as far as I can tell, the inarguable pick for the greatest episode of television ever created.<br/><br/>But perhaps the show's greatest accomplishment is the fact that it takes the trajectory most shows take and flips it. The vast, vast majority of shows start out great, and get worse and worse, until the finale, which is once again great. "Breaking Bad" flips it exactly. The pilot is great, and the show starts out worse than the pilot, and then gets better and better and better, ending in the legendary final season, without hesitation the greatest final season of television ever.<br/><br/>It also has the second-best series finale I've ever seen (seconded by "Everyone's Waiting" from Six Feet Under), brilliant tying up loose ends.<br/><br/>I struggle to find the words that can accurately convey the brilliance of this show, so I'll simply tell you to watch it, and know that I've never known anyone who disliked this show. Not much can be said about what hasn't been said. This is one of, if not the, greatest drama of all-time. It has revolutionized viewer expectations, and has created a nightmare for TV drama writers. People now expect BrBa quality, but that is extremely hard to reach. But acting, directing, writing, story, characterization, are all phenomenal. My only flaw, is that like meth it has formed an addiction with no way to truly suppress my addiction now that its over. But I am thankful they ended this show on a high note, and didn't continue it past its lifetime, like so many great shows do **cough** Walking Dead **cough**. Imagine you live a normal life with a normal job and have a family. Everything is going well and one day you find out that the bad guys are making more in an hour then you make in a year but that doesn't deter you and you keep on going with your normal life. Then suddenly you realise you wasted all your potential and got nothing to show for your life and the moment you plan to do something you're struck down with a disease that's not curable and you have a very short time to live and you have left nothing for you family. What will you do?Welcome everyone,I know that the introduction was a lot sad but that's the starting point of this show which shows us the reality of what would happen if good guys try to do bad things. Let's talk about the life of Walter White(Heisenberg).<br/><br/>Check out the article at : www.paul96.org<br/><br/>Articles related to Breaking Bad : http://paul96.org/breaking-bad-hail-heisenberg/ http://paul96.org/walter-white-jesse-pinkman-the-devilish-drug- lords/ http://paul96.org/gustavo-fring-the-grim-kingpin/ http://paul96.org/breaking-bad-the-best-episodes/ A slow steady heart throbbing start, mixed with a lot of unexpected events. And when you have seen the whole season its like something is now missing from your life.<br/><br/>Walter White is truly unique character. Go on watch it, love it and just fell for this addictive, surprising and sublime series. An amazing series about a Chemistry teacher diagnosed with cancer who decides to make drugs. At first Walter's decision to make drugs is to make money for his family to pass away, but the real reason why he keeps doing it, is because those years that he spends making math are the times that he has felt most alive, ironically despite the fact that he is dying. What makes this series so good is Walter's character, watching him progress from this person who has never had any excitement in his life, to doing "new" things due to the fact that he is living as though it was his last day. I rooted for Walter through the end, despite many of the monstrous acts that he committed, due to the admiration I have for this amazing character. There are many other very well fleshed out characters who are all amazing, but not on the level of Walter Hartwell White. Also, every single soundtrack which is picked in this series fits in perfectly and suits the scene which it is put in. This ... this!!!!!! my life is divided into two parts , a part that did not watch breaking bad , and a part that did watch breaking bad . this TV series shows you what it's like for meth dealers out there , how they live their lives , are they happy ? does money blind them ? but it's not just this: the drama and the sad parts the betrayals the *EVERYTHING* this is not your ordinary TV series talking about drugs , no .. no this is bigger than all TV series , this is a documentary ! a sad and painful to watch documentary ! and it's all true! everything happened in the series has happened in rel life! This show changed my life! I was someone else , I thought differently when I saw season 3 and 5 , I should appreciate life and what's given to me , I will never do drugs , I will study and become something! this is what the show gave me! gave me hope to change and maybe quit some of my own addictions like smoking ! please: if you want to change your life and maybe quit some bad habits , watch this TV series , it's something else . at first i can't tell anyone how much i miss breaking bad ,, but i will Waite for anything like it.. sometime i still thinking about everything in breaking bad.. sometime i love to watch it every time .. so i really miss breaking bad .. i miss Walter_white___Jesse_pinkman.. oh how much Breaking Bad - Season 4 was so amazing .. and another seasons were amazing too .. at last i hope to watch any new will be for breaking bad .. but maybe will be more of breaking bad ?? or any new like breaking bad .. i hope that .. i found something about ( better call soul ) .. i will wait to watch it .. really i will wait because maybe that will be amazing too .. with my best wishes for all .. thanks for all about it.. The show is too much slow for my liking. At times I kind of just want to skip some parts. The repetitiveness of both the plot and Bryan Cranston's acting mixed with the dull and boring storyline for the last 3 seasons make it easy not to care about the characters. What a shame for a show that began so strongly to end on such a predictable whimper. I lasted until the third season with this. It started off initially good and had an intriguing concept but by season three it began to run out of steam, all the characters were unsympathetic and when it started laying the foundations of his wife having an affair, I realised that the initial concept was being replaced by a tedious daytime family soap opera.<br/><br/>Wasted opportunity and I can't help but think it gets such good press because believe that saying they liked it makes them look cool rather than it actually being something special. An overwrought,overly-hyped, overly precious, hipster type of show if I ever saw one! Of course, this is all subjective, as is one's taste in movies and television shows.<br/><br/>"Breaking Bad" never held my attention, never drew me in at any level or point in time. It has become an almost sacrilegious thing to criticize everyone's darling TV show! Yet I really don't care...just as not everyone I know likes the same shows I do! <br/><br/>You can try to explain to people why you dislike a certain television series, as is the case with "Breaking Bad", yet some of the more vociferous fans take it as a personal insult if one should disagree with the premise that "Breaking Bad" is one, if not the best TV show ever made! According to them, you must be suffering some-kind of brain damage by not seeing that very fact which looms soo large before your eyes! <br/><br/>Well I thoroughly disagree with that, and I have more than enough shows in mind that I consider far better than "Breaking Bad"...shows that shall remain nameless,since as I said, it is all a matter of perspective and taste.<br/><br/>I have tried repeatedly to get into the show and its universe...but to no avail! I have tried watching individual episodes, but never made it through more than half...I have tried to take on the marathon showings over at AMC, with little success. I was just not attracted or interested. I did not identify with the characters, nor was I drawn in by the story, which I found left me indifferent. Suffices to say, I am not a fan! <br/><br/>As for "Heisenberg"..."Malcolm In The Middle" dad! That's it! Nothing else to say about the lead or the cast! <br/><br/>So I did not break bad watching "Breaking Bad"...I just didn't care. Nor will I...ever! There are some shows like that... you feel pretty alone not adhering to the unanimous enthusiasm.<br/><br/>It started interesting but lost steam pretty fast and around season 2 or 3 the story started going in circles and resorting to all the tricks writers use when they run out of inspiration, never-ending problems, characters acting like parodies of themselves, any conversation was a shouting contest, heavy doses of annoying drama were introduced, tension was artificially created in a not so subtle way and once in a while the plot was moving forward, occasionally. The last season actually raised the level back up a little, but the previous one felt extremely tedious.<br/><br/>The production quality remained higher than a really low-grade cash-cow week-day afternoon show so it was still watchable without too much fast-forwarding, but the ingredients of a tired idea producers want to squeeze to the last drop are so obvious to me that its unbelievable, passionate success is a true mystery to me. People are not very demanding. The pilot was very strong and first episodes promising, but the plot is simply unbelieveble. The actors do a great job, but the story just fails to captivate. Sny real person would be dead or busted half way season 1. I think people really like to see self-destructive people maybe they want to see how the other half lives, maybe it gives them a sense of being a bad ass because they like a show so disgusting, but I am seriously worried when so many people find such trash to be brilliant. I watched it, the show is grimy. Couldn't go past the pilot episode. Nothing stands out, the characters are walking talking clichÃ©s. The humor is flat, and the script is not worth the time spent on it. Weeds (different name, same story), is corny and over the top, but was released first, and is a lot more entertaining. And don't take itself THIS seriously. Trolls can create different accounts to raise the rating, it won't change anything. And I'm surprised the website allows these spam reviews, that clearly come from the same little group of people, every time a Â« bad one Â» is posted. See for yourselves ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘‡ I expected an ending that could make the audience to give some sympathy for Walter White but the truth is he just made things right and if somehow could save his family and still producing drugs he would do it all over again as he himself confesses to his wife in the last episode. I also couldn't as a viewer develop any hatred about Jack, Todd and the gang as they were only in the final episodes. It would be wiser to end the series by killing Gus and making things just again like in season 4 which was the best season in my opinion. It's like season 5 is independent from the rest of the series. The plot was also unfair regarding Hank and the way he died. Favourite performances were those of Walter White, Walter White Jr and Gustavo Fring. Very tiring and long scenes without any impact on the plot whatsoever. A few moments of suspense in specific episodes. Very nice directing and performance regarding director and actors but really poor scenario. Mediocre series with one of the most disappointing endings. I can't rate it higher than 6. It was way too slow of a start. They focused on the wife way too much and the show is incredibly over hyped. Overall - very good show, except the unlikeable characters SÃ¶ssmsmsmsksmsmsmsksksmdkdmskskskskskskskskwkskskekekekskdkwkekekekek First off, 9.5 for this show is way too over rated. I was utter disappointed after watching this with big Hype.<br/><br/>After a point, Most of the characters in this series are literally unlikeable and I got to a point where I din't give a hoot about what happens to whom. And what's worse, the very few good ones in the show also gets killed. And the only Happy thing was that Piece of Garbage protagonist or should I say antagonist of the show
was finally dead. Now that's a Happy ending. I was rooting for his death for a long time.<br/><br/>My Point is the show is pretty decent/good but any show must establish some sort of connection between the audience and the main characters but this show fails big time on that. So one can easily lose interest as you go through the last few seasons.<br/><br/>My advice is Don't get fooled by High ratings. Watch and decide for yourself. My Friend recommended me this TV series, So i decided to watch it. The starting two seasons is just okey.But the real thrill began in the 3rd season .And I finally was eager to watch the next episode after finishing one.<br/><br/>This show has been masterfully put together with layer upon layer of insight into some of the most interesting characters ever realized in the history of television. We have some very dark characters, and a lot of grey characters, and it all adds up to brilliant dialogue and plot lines.<br/><br/>now Em fan of Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul (yoo!!)..i love this TV Show! I absolutely loved this show! I have watched every season twice! I recommend this show to everyone! You will be hooked right away and find yourself wanting to watch episode after episode! Everything about this show is excellent! Bryan Cranston is sensational, his acting is one of the best performances I have ever seen! The character he plays, Walter White, becomes one of the greatest television show characters of all time! Even though Walter White does a lot of bad things, you will be rooting for him the entire time! Aaron Paul, who plays Jesse Pinkman, is Walter Whites partner in crime and you will love him and hate him equally! I had never heard of Aaron Paul until I watched this show and I was so impressed with how great his acting was! There are so many other great characters in this show that you will love! I do not want to give away any spoilers so take my word for it and go and watch every episode, this show is a must see!<br/><br/>I give Breaking Bad a 10 out of 10 Acting: A+ Story/Writing: A+ Characters: A+ Ending: A+ This is the best television series I've ever seen, and really goes into the realm of feature films as well, as far as being in my top ten. I cannot think of anything as of late that punched me in the face like this show did. I absolutely love it. If you have not seen it, do yourself a HUGE favor and rent the first season so you'll know what's going on, and you can see the transition of the characters. This show is beautifully written with plot twists coming in refreshing ways, and at just the right times. Some of what is shown I was surprised they put it on television,... and that's a great thing !! The acting is brilliant, and the themes are amazing, timeless and timely, and are presented to us in thought provoking ways that leave me pondering philosophical ideas long after the show is over. Yeah, this is a TV series !!! On AMC !! Hard to believe. This is one I'm raving about to everyone I know, and hope keeps going for a long, long time !!! Thanks to everyone involved with this genius show !!! 10/10 Masterpiece This is one of those top of the league series. Once you start watching you can't stop it. My wife and I were completely hooked on this series. Brilliant actors with a great storyline. A lot of twists that makes it that you want to see the next episode as soon as possible. The suspense that is build in every episode is great. You can't do anything else then hope that Walter White gets away with it. Too bad that at one point the series had to stop because for us it could have gone on and on forever. So we were disappointed when it was over but now that there is a spin off we are already looking forward to that one. If "Better Call Saul" is in the same way then it can't go wrong. Anyways, "Breaking Bad" is a must-see if you never saw it. What more can I say about this show other than that it is the best show I've ever seen. I watched this because I saw that Ozymandias got a 10/10 and I saw all the awards and I was like, heck yes I'm watching this show. I finished it in under 2 weeks and was so intrigued every second of every episode. The last episode was my favorite ending ever. It ended perfectly! I love this show because of the phenomenal acting, writing, directing, and plot overall. It is a genius idea. Thank you AMC for making amazing TV shows. I love Breaking Bad. <br/><br/>Nuff said.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad. I've watched thousands of movies and TV shows and have to admit, some of them were really great. However; I've never written a review for any of them, watched without sleeping for days, listened the soundtrack, classified a TV show as a movie, watched youtube videos of it's characters and yeah, never written RIP for Walter White!!!! Breaking Bad is a punch in your face. You'll question whats good and bad in life and it will affect your reasoning. Breaking Bad will touch you one way or another, and you'll never forget. <br/><br/>I no longer enjoy watching a TV show or a so called great movie. Nothing thrills me anymore. Nothing keeps me idle for whats next. Nothing does touch actually. After watching top 100 movies, the top TV shows and many other crap, I can undoubtedly say that it's the greatest production of all times. After watching entire 62 episodes for the third time, it is time for me to write a tribute to the greatest TV show ever. I was reading some reviews on the site and very few of them had one star and even those small population of reviews instantly and immensely pained me. It got me to think how you will always have a section of people who cannot bring themselves to like even the best things in life. Such reviews are really sad. And this show does not deserve anything less than 10/10.<br/><br/>This TV show is epic - well written, well acted and well edited. It is Shakespearean. It is an instant classic. From the first episode to Felina - gripping, endearing and loftiest style of story telling. Memorable performances by the actors that will get permanently etched into your memories. No amount of hype does justice to the sheer brilliance of this show.<br/><br/>This show should be on everybody's "Things to do before I die" list. Do yourself a favor, go watch it. I'm onto my 4th round. It's simple. I've never been so hooked up with a series in a my life. Since I watched the first episode in season 1, I couldn't stop watching it. Vince Gilligan did a fantastic work here. The written is a piece of art. The opening theme is sticky. The characters, the script, the actors, the locations, the shots... it's ALL WELL DONE! Every minute, every second is enjoyable. Want to know my truth? today I finished watching all seasons, and I can't imagine my life going on without more seasons of Breaking Bad. I'm sad, because I will miss Mr. White and Mr. Pinkman.<br/><br/>This is the best series in history. No doubt it is the best TV series.The story really touches our heart. The first season was a worthy start.We come to know about Walter White,the man with the Chemistry High School Teacher-cum-"The man who knocks". The second season unfolds the story ,while the third,fourth and fifth season will keep you rooted to the spot .The last 3 seasons brings out other lead characters like Saul Goodman,Mike Ehrmantraut,Hector Salamanca,Todd Alquist etc.Vince Gilligan was the mastermind and really did a great job.Now talking about the actors Bryan Cranston(Walter White),Aaron Paul(Jesse Pinkman) and Anna Gunn(Skyler White) was at their career best while Bob Odenkirk(Saul Goodman),Giancarlo Esposito(Gustavo Fring),Jonathan Banks(Mike Ehrmantraut) were awesome. I cried as the series ended and badly wanted for more seasons to come. It's a must watch for everyone and I hope you will enjoy the 'nail-biting' episodes. Thank you ! My brother, a year or two back, started watching Breaking Bad. Having heard a lot about it, and wanting to know what was keeping him glued to his computer screen, I watched the Pilot one day. And I was blown away.<br/><br/>Before Breaking Bad, I hadn't seen very much television. When I heard of the premise, I immediately thought that it would be about the character becoming a drug dealer, and his many different drug deals. Kind of like a procedural. But, when I was watching the first season, I was confused. Each episode flowed into the next, telling a story. It wasn't like other shows that had a case of the week. It was special.<br/><br/>I proceeded to watch the first two and a half seasons, and then it was summer. I went to camp that summer, as the first half of season 5 was being released on TV. All the time, I was anxiously awaiting when I could go home and finish watching Breaking Bad. So, when I got home, I finished all that exists thus far of Breaking Bad.<br/><br/>This was my first foray into truly excellent, serialized television. What I loved the most was that it was a gripping series, full of subtle nuances that made it above average. For example, the teases during the second season that foreshadow the climactic ending of Season Two, or the excellent opening of Season Three. I could go on. It was surreal to see these images that translated into poetry, even through the darkness of Walter White.<br/><br/>Speaking about Walter White, I still think that he is the greatest television character of all time. Some say that Tony Soprano is the greatest, or Don Draper, or whomever else; but Walter White stands above the rest. His descent into Heisenberg is eerily perfect, played to the finest detail by Bryan Cranston. It's the best part of the show.<br/><br/>Really, to understand Breaking Bad, you have to watch it. It's the only way to understand the genius behind it. I will be honest, I haven't YET seen The Sopranos, The Wire, Mad Men, or Dexter (other supposedly excellent shows), but I feel that they won't ever aspire to the greatness of Breaking Bad, yo. I appreciate the show for holding nothing back. I think it demonstrates how ridiculous the war on drugs is, while showing in detail the devastation drugs can have on one's life. This show demonstrates that most of the problems resulting from drugs are created by criminalizing people for such victim-less crimes. The residual victimizing drugs create are as a result of the illegality of them. It shows the hypocrisy of many issues, such as alcohol prohibition. as to how one day they can be illegal and the next day be legal. The DEA's wife is committing an actual crime such as theft, but it's OK when your husbands a DEA. Just got into the show and I busted out the first 2 seasons in the last few days and I'm just now getting into the 3rd. I have to admit the show gets a little draining, because it seems to have way too many lows and not enough highs. The wife thing got really draining for me... if I wanted to deal with that crap I would have gotten married... instead I watch this show and I feel like I am. It's like I totally understand about the wife's frustration and all, but do I really need to deal with it every frickin episode!!! What were they thinking... that's not fun to watch, man! I really hope the writers figure that crap out before the end of the 3rd season. The constant nagging between Mr. White and Jessie get's tiring and draining as well (mostly created by Mr. White). It takes 2 full seasons before the show even goes into a potential caring or friendship between the two of them. You have Mr. White being a total ahole to Jessie all the time and Jessie always on the defense. 95% of there interactions is one of them screaming at the top of their lungs at the other one... not entertaining, not fun, not funny, just really draining! When he lit the money on fire, I was honestly about to stop watching the show, but luckily he had a change of heart, because that would have been the straw that broke the camels back for me and I'm sure a lot of other people as well. The neighbor chick dying was really sad... also bummed because she was soooo hot, now I'm left spanking to sage brush. Anywho I rate the show a 10 because it's better then most the crap out there, and I like the message the show is portraying. Overall the show is mildly entertaining, it's nothing I would wait on in anticipation on weekly basis, but I know that's the case for a lot of the peeps into this show. Breaking Bad had a slow start. The first season took some time to get used to. The second season became interesting, and the third and fourth make it one of the finest dramas of all time. What's so interesting about Breaking Bad is that you simply cannot take any character's side and stay partial to him/her. The story picks up pace brilliantly as seasons progress. One of the major assets of this show is its razor sharp and quite splendid characterization.<br/><br/>Quite simply, Breaking Bad is one of the finest, American television has had to offer after the likes of Six Feet Under, The Sopranos and AMC's very own Mad Men. Should have been one series only as it goes on and on and on. I think it is very overrated. The caveat here is that I only made it through 1 season and a couple episodes of season 2 then had to quit. I really tried to like this show but my god is it boring. I've heard the show gets really good in the later seasons but you shouldn't have to watch 10-15 hours to "get to the good stuff". I honestly don't get it. Aaron Paul is a horrible actor too, it's honestly cringeworthy. Someone please tell me what I'm missing. Oh one more thing- I don't want to see Bryan Cranston force himself onto his wife anymore, I almost puked I know what this show is about but really not that great. Show tried to keep things real, but it became too real and too boring to watch The worst I've ever seen
This can't be 9.5
It deserves 0/10 Overrated
A teacher of chemistry becomes a drug dealer after he knows that he have cancer it's normal and not nice actress no comparing to GOT the greatest ever or to peaky blinders plz for god sack stop comparing this to them Semi ok story but too much foreign language. If you wanna succeed in a country that plays you, speak it's language. Drop the spanish, esp w no subitles. I will not be brainwashed. I stopped watching beginning of season 2. This show doesn't deserve all the praises it gets. It certainly does have its moments action wise, but the characters are way to flat to carry the whole story for that amount of time. The side characters don't seem to have any personality whatsoever with the exception of Hank. Walter's wife and son are just walking stereotypes of the middle class suburban household but without any feelings. They get into superficial fights but there is no love or anything, no deep connection normal people tend to have with family or friends. This bland character writing is also evident with other figures like Fring or Marie. The same goes for Walter and Jesse. None of them really experiences any character development. Walter is an evil guy from the beginning, just hiding behind the curtain of a family man. Jesse, while a little less evil, seems strangely indifferent to everything and even when playing the role of a good guy for some time he solely drowns in self-sorrow, that's all. No empathy, no character change. There is no real personal struggle like normal people would experience and therefore I lost interest in their fate pretty quickly. Talking to your family like they are estranged relatives you just want to get rid of before turning into an equally unfeeling murderer doesn't count as character development. I recommend watching Gomorra instead, there is a lot of violence and everyone is horrible but you can also feel the love the characters have for their families and fear for their well-being so you care for the story a lot more. I'm so mad people kept telling me to finish this. This is the WORST show ever. The whole series could be explained in one episode, would give it a 10 but nah fing 50 episodes one hour long give me a fing brake. I never see stupid boring story like this , and it what the most wasting time of my life A very good series but its to much overrated . I gave it 8 and i am so generous with it<br/><br/>Got is the goat I watched because everyone said it's THE show to watch, my kids, my friends, critics I respect. Two seasons in and I'm utterly bored. The plot meanders along, most of the characters are utterly unbelievable and do stuff that just does not work. I can't watch any more. An irrational event and chemistry teacher suddenly becomes a drug dealer in one episode It is truly an amazing show. Great cast great story but for me personaly its a bit overrated :(
But its a hell of a tv show First time I saw the show it was pretty good. Now, I'm watching it again, and it's kind of painful.<br/><br/>Not sure why, maybe because of familiarity with the characters, or maybe because of something with the suspense. But if you're a Breaking Bad virgin, which is unlikely these days, cheerish your first time. In 2011, this show had a 9.4 out of 50,000 votes meaning that the vast majority watched it after watching the fifth season.I hope people expecting an amazing series don't quit watching after the first 14 episodes<br/><br/>Season 1= 4 out of 7 episodes are good.Overall a watchable season. Rating 7.5/10<br/><br/>Season 2= 4 out of 13 episodes are good.The weakest season by far.The first 7 episodes are complete filler till better call Saul episode.Not to mention the filler is boring as well.But the season ends nicely. Rating 5/10<br/><br/>Season 3= 6 out of 13 episodes are good.Better than the second season but also includes a lot of filler in between.2 good episodes at the start, 2 in the middle and 2 at the end. Rating 7/10<br/><br/>Season 4= 8 out of 13 episodes are good.First 2 are good and 6 at the end.This is where breaking bad starts to truly get good.<br/><br/>Rating 8/10<br/><br/>Season 5= 16 out of 16 episodes are good while last 8 episodes are exceptional.This is the season that truly deserves that 9.5 rating<br/><br/>Overall, I think Breaking bad should have a 9.3 rating according to IMDb standards If you are a bit like me you might think that a TV series on drugs can't be very interesting. However I've been proved wrong. This show is the most intense, profound and brilliant show I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Describing this show is not easy though. What makes it this special? To me it is the psychological depth of the characters, the progression of life stories and the small and large scale snowball effects in response to choices being made.<br/><br/>I'm not a professional in filming techniques, but even I can see that Breaking Bad is also unique in camera work. Unusual angles are used to shoot a different than usual series and little imperfections are cherished instead of polished away. This series shows wrinkles, body hair and moles. Just as it shows people making little normal daily mistakes, that don't add to the story but make it look so much more natural. <br/><br/>To conclude I'd say if this TV series was a book it would be literature, so it is definitely a must watch! *** EDITED & UPDATED<br/><br/>Excellent concept, high quality acting, etc., etc... Probably one of THE most brilliant creative ideas for television since LOST, and Vince Gilligan being one of the prominent X-Files producers is obviously quite intelligent and capable, no question about it.<br/><br/>BUT...<br/><br/>There are two things that come to mind that I humbly feel would have TREMENDOUSLY strengthened the show: First, okay, I get the part where Walt was hiding everything from his family and yes, I was truly looking forward to the point where inevitably his wife would find out and then work together with him in his 'enterprise'. Okay, good... BUT... I really think they kind of pushed the back and forth with the relationship between them a little too much. I think that they did this strictly for a supposed 'dramatic' effect. They introduced a number or 'contrary-isms' to add to the drama between them, which I feel with the overall strength of the story, was not necessary and resulted in many WTF moments, especially in particular where she was concerned.<br/><br/>The second main point here, and this is even a bigger one, what the HELL was up with all the back and forth between Walt and Jesse...??? This struck me as very artificial and contrived. I mean, they take ALL this time building up this affection Walt has for Jesse and all that they have been through together, and then they throw these 'curves' into the story. Even Hank summed it up quite well to Jesse that despite as totally ruthless as Walt was, he clearly and CONSISTENTLY cared for Jesse and even killed to save his life. He paid for his rehab, made him a 50% partner, and saved his life more than once in quite dramatic ways, even putting himself in danger. Then, after all this... the writers have them at each others bloody throats at a moment's notice... And the 'subplot' about the poisoning and later Walt's saying 'I saw Jane die'...? WHY...!?? REALLY...??? I just didn't buy it. To me this seemed TOTALLY out of nowhere and greatly diminished our emotional investment in them, and I feel, really wasn't genuinely in sync with all the things that had gone before between them. Just think how much MORE we would have been engaged emotionally If they had strengthened the bond between them and then had them united against whatever Bad Guys who came along and then come up with clever things to deal with them. But, no, the producers in their wisdom thought this constant, mindless enmity was somehow better. I really just don't think so...<br/><br/>Also, I understand and appreciate how they would want to try to market this edgy Crime Thriller to women too; okay, understandable. There were indeed a primary executive producer, a director, numerous producers, and a couple of writers that were women. But the WAY they did it, I think personally, really pushed the believability of many of their actions. And all this likely just for the sake of 'Conflict' and 'drama'.<br/><br/>The bottom line (and I DO like saying 'Bottom') is this: There seemed to be too much superficial 'Dramatic' manipulation, WAY too much Flip- Flopping back and forth, just for the sake of supposedly getting the audience worked up and more 'involved'. I simply don't think that all this extra 'Drama' was necessary; the BRILLIANT, involving plot and NATURAL evolution of the characters are PLENTY to keep us involved. It's like throwing in excessive and gratuitous language or sex or whatever in an otherwise well written and produced show; it detracts from the excellent quality that is already there.<br/><br/>They screwed with the authenticity of the main characters so much that to me the only ones left where their actions, motivations, and reactions stayed believably true and consistent most of the time, were Mike, Hank, & Saul. They were the ones I liked best because my emotional and BELIEVABLE investment was much stronger in them.<br/><br/>These particular elements I feel dominated the story more than they should have done. In light of the overwhelming talent in the show, both behind and in front of the camera, these manipulations were ultimately unnecessary and detracted from the overall effectiveness of the show. Sure, there were MANY great plot turns and scenes that were quite honestly brilliant, but when averaged out over the course of how they chose to 'develop' the characters, I feel that it diluted the potential of the show, which COULD have been pure genius.<br/><br/>I would honestly give my left nut (the smaller of the two) if they would have just cut down a little on all the contrived character / relationship fluctuations and conflict and just let the strength of the story and the more NATURAL development of the characters carry the show.<br/><br/>Still... one of the best ever series to come to television in a while! Seasons 1 and 2 are good but it gets really (really) good on season 3. At first i thought that everything will happen very fast and he (the main character) will be king of everything and all. Wrong! the show takes its time and that makes it more realistic about the difficult decisions that must be taken. Most episodes are really "quite" with a hint for next episodes or with one define moment. What i really love is the ironies and how everyone/everything are being connected with the story along the way. Watch it if you like slow, clever, realistic and a little bit hard core movies/series. it's not "Tarantino style" hard core but has its moments! I'm not saying is bad but isn't the greatest either, love the adrenaline, suspense and drama, yes WW is a genius but that's about it. I don't understand what's all the fuss about.
And yes, I'm writing this review after watching GOT Enjoyed the first two seasons. 3 and 4 were boring AF. finale was okay. thanks for keeping it to 5 seasons because i couldn't take anymore. how does this show have nearly 10 stars? for Cranston's acting? while his acting was great (obviously WW sucked from the start) it's not enough for me to leave a higher rating and i don't plan to watch this series again. Yes this series had potentials. The reason I'm using past tense is because that the damage is unfixable. Unlike to other reviews that you will read i will stick to the essence of what people need to read and that is facts. <br/><br/>To begin with i will start with the pros. Character selection is the major asset of this series. All roles are well played representing exactly the feelings that need to be transferred to the audience. Other than that, what i liked in this series is the photography. Nice original shots that make you partially not to pay attention to the scenarios flaws.<br/><br/>Yes the scenario is leaking from everywhere. <br/><br/>First of all there is lack of focus. When i say lack of focus i mean what is this movie about? Is it a drama which speaks about a family man doing whatever he can to provide? If this is the answer then 4-5 episodes should be enough to present that. However the series is off to the 4th season and i yet to understand why i am watching it. Definitely is not for the suspense or the action. Neither for the cool chemistry involved.<br/><br/>Second, the scenario does not convince me. Although that 70% of the story is brightly written many scenes just do not sum up. What you would expect from a chemistry genius related scenario is at least to justify its actor's actions.<br/><br/>Another con is the long meaningless dialogs. In every episode there are at least 3-4 dialogs that put you to sleep. <br/><br/>Summing up what i would like to see from this series is: 1) Cool chemistry involved 2) More action 3) Less talking<br/><br/>and 4) please some suspense Dosn't have the power to keep my attention at all, i expected better. To be honest i don't know why this TV series is being called one of the best shows ever created by critics. In series 1 you are introduced to the characters and Walter finds out about his cancer. Nearly all the episodes in the first season are slow paced but this isn't always a bad thing but sometimes it is for example a man is kept in a basement for 4 episodes and you may not think this is long but it is for a 7 episode series. And also the whole show is suppose to be about Walter and Jesse cooking and selling meth, however they barely sell any in the first season. To be honest the only thing that kept me watching was the amazing acting. And it was only from a few characters...everyone was on top form. The second season is where the show starts getting good. No episode is slow paced and now there is some guaranteed action such as a shootout or fights. Unlike the first series where there was barely any action violence. Also This is a 13 episode season which i think is a good amount of episodes. Also everything is on a bigger scale like the deals, buyer, and basically all situations and trust me its keeps getting better from here. This show is very boring i can't belive that people compare this with game of thrones. Game of thrones is 1000 times better than this boring show This is a decent show but 9.5/10? NO "the greatest show of all time" NO. I seriuosly cant see what all the hype is a about. This is no wear close to game of thrones(even tho season 8wasnt good).<br/><br/>I seriously gave this a chance and watched all seasons and after each episode i was paining myself to see the next one. Not even once was i like ''oh i wanna see another''.. more like ''omg still so many epsiodes left of this season''..<br/><br/>I find the show average 5/10. If i find a show good i would wanna rewatch it again sometime. Neverever this show. I hated it it was extremely badly edited and the story line was horrific It has some of the best scenes I ever seen, sadly the whole thing is so streched out that majority of run time is as boring and slow as it could get. Once everywhile something awesome happens, but the wait in between makes me question it's greatness. It's quite a cash grab when you think about it, instead of masterpiece 30-40 episodes they streched it out to 62 to make more money. First 2 seasons were gripping then it begins to drag. It's quite difficult to believe how Mr white's character changes drastically .Lot of loopholes and coincidences makes it a bit boring. The story mainly concentrates on Mr white so much that other lovable characters like Jesse and Hank are neglected in the end. By the end actually I started hating Mr White and was a bit disappointed with the climax. Everyone of my friends and family said this was the dogs b****cks first few episodes not so good but you will get into it, I'm now on season 4 episode 4 and its still absolute RUBBISH, one of the supposedly good TV shows I cant get into, I don't get what the big deal is with it, same old rubbish over and over again. I really don't get why this TV show is so high rated, if you want to watch something intriguing climatic with twists watch these shows, I recommend Game of thrones, Wentworth, the 100, Power, The blacklist, Blindspot, Homeland, Stranger things, Empire, How to get away with murder, Making a murderer, Narcos, El Chapo, I don't know if its because I watched these before Breaking Bad but was really terrible compared to these especially as so many people thought breaking bad was amazing. In the opening credits, being that part of the show is focused on chemistry, letter combinations in the opening credit names that correspond with element symbols are highlighted, with the first letter of the chemical element capitalized.<br/><br/>The Director of Photography is Michael Slovis (if you read this, great job!). The two letters that are highlighted as a chemical element symbol are the 3rd and 4th letters of his first name (mine as well)... Ch.<br/><br/>But Ch is not a symbol for any element! And we wonder why we are so behind in science compared with other countries! Michael Hogan, PE Chemical Engineer if uve seen some and you like the general style then id say you are in for a special period in your life.<br/><br/>when someone asked me what it is (really unknown in Europe at the moment), i said it's a bit of a genre of it's own, being a mix of suspense (The Unit type of thrill), and black comedy within tragedy; i.e. it has serious stuff in it as well / is thought-provoking.<br/><br/>i really hope they will keep it up for the 4th season.<br/><br/>p.s. id skip episode 4 of the first season though, and maybe the 3rd too, i don't remember about the third.<br/><br/>p.p.s. many will disagree, but i think it's on par with The Wire, if not better :) In my opinion, this tv series and others (such as GOT) along the same lines are only suitable for teenages who enjoy films that depict violent actions.<br/><br/>The series doesn't have a clear point. If as some say, the movie shows that one has to be fearless in life, we see that it's exactly this line of thinking that led the character and those around him to utter ruin. So the message cannot be this.<br/><br/>If, however , the movie is for entertainment, it has failed to do so as well. The tone is not facetious enough. But it may be argued that this tv series is serious fiction. This is not true either. If it is serious we must see some clear point which the movie fails to make. If the theme of the series has been consequences as many argue, up until the end of the fourth series the only deliberate and evil choice that Walter makes is that he decides to cook meth, and that is justifyable because as a good man he has failed to provide for his family. And it is to protect Jesse and later himself and his family that he is propelled to run over two guys and later to kill Gus.
But a man who was good until the end of season 4 suddenly turns bad and there is a lack of justification for this transformation. He becomes ruthless and a monster. The consequences of his actions are only limited to season five. Plus, he is not the only one who pays the price. The innocent ones such as Hank or Jesse's second girlfriend who haven't done anything wrong also face consequences which puts the theme of consequences in serious doubt.<br/><br/>The weiter/s seems to make up the plot as they go along and the excitement of violence for attracting a large audience and winning awards is what the show, in my view, is all about.<br/><br/>Recently, the series such as this one and GOT rely more on violence and knotty plots (that teenages enjoy) to put on the clothes of serious fiction rather than tell the audience a good story that they can enjoy. Oh my God!!! I started watching this series because I checked out the reviews and the ratings was over the roof, the lowest was 9/10, like what is wrong with people? This show is one of the worst shows I have ever seen, it is so slow with unnecessary drama rotating amongst 7 characters. I can't believe the people who watched this and rated it anything above 4.5/10, I think the Meth was distributed after the show and everyone got HIGH hence the HIGH ratings. Starts VERY well but descends into utter ridiculousness. Walter Sr. is, quite simply, utterly unbelievable as a "bad guy", which taints the entire show. 5 seasons of the series are not too long. Almost all EPs are very interesting and smart plots. Just some EP or motivations i feel like it lacks evidence and characters are too dumb at some point. Breaking Bad<br/><br/>This was my choice for a quarantine box set as I missed it at the time.<br/><br/>Much was brilliant, a gathering storm up to the end of series 4, it then perhaps seems the case it was a victim of its own success. Series 5 became baggy and unfocused and really was quite unrecognisable from what had gone before.<br/><br/>Walter had clear motivations behind his actions, following the death of Fring everything just fell into an abyss of contrivances.<br/><br/>The cast universally were quite brilliantly played. I would say that Aaron Paul was the right man at the right place in the right part and perhaps of the entire cast the weakest actor, but still gave a mesmeric performance.<br/><br/>If I was to put my finger on the key brilliance of this show I would say it lays in the meticulous planning and nuance of the script, and really striking new ground in the breadth and scope of TV drama.<br/><br/>Overall I loved it This show tells underground life of South USA perfectly. You have to watch that. Meth Meth Meth<br/><br/>Season 1 enemy - Tuco

This one is so exciting and fun. 2 man making drug by chemicals way and going hard way with some dangerous man, that story is so good , so impressive and so addicting When you don't sleep for several days/weeks
because of a series,then this is something
serious... Maybe best acting show ever ,,,,,, its impact on me more than big movies ''drama ,, mystery,, action,, crime,,comedy,, and horror sometimes,, its complicated to describe I can't believe I waited this long to watch this show. I wish I could watch it for the first time over and over again. This series is the best. OF ALL TIME. All the characters are so intense and the story telling gets better and better. Loved the series from the core of my heart. I wanna thank all the people involved in the making of this series that made the greatest series of all time. Now, I watch all the other series and think to myself that: this series won't be as good as Breaking Bad. YEA The best tv series ever produced and no one (I mean literally no one) come close to this masterfully written series. There was a hope for GOT but they sucked so badly.
10/10
Mr. White, your legacy will remain forever! ðŸ˜ŒðŸ’™
PS- Don't get me wrong but Felina could've been much better (it was still a great ending no doubt but as the last scene occurred their was a lil dissatisfaction I felt. Just my opinion though, peace!) "Breaking Bad" is an incredible TV Show on television to watch, for the hole entire audience around the world, can't stop talking about it. "Vince Gilligan is the best creator of the show". "Bryan Cranston is phenomenal", and "Aaron Paul is incredible". Best performance on television that deserves the golden globe awards, and Oscars winning best actors, best picture and best winning TV show on television. And you can see it again, and again, and all over again. Te prende do inicio ao fim.
Boa histÃ³ria. Parece real. Personagens incrÃ­veis Well, I've finally finished watching the entire Breaking Bad. I can honestly say it's quite probably the most consistently excellent TV show I've ever seen, with the arguable exception of The Wire. Damn, but it's hard to call which is better, so I'm not going to.
Most shows which have longevity really struggle to bring things to a close when their number is finally up, but the way Walter White ends his meth-cooking saga, on his own terms, is nothing short of genius.
There's really not much that could've been done to make Breaking Bad better, even with hindsight. The lead performances of Walt and Jesse are superb, and the majority of the supporting cast do solid work with sometimes slim material. If I was being uber critical I might suggest some of the lesser characters don't serve much purpose, but then again they're part of the wallpaper of life, as it were; no one lives in a vacuum, especially not meth-cooking master criminals. The dialogue is frequently fantastic, but not generally out of character, and the storyboarding is more than occasionally astoundingly good. Notable scenes are the mariachi tale of how much the Mexican cartels had come to hate Heisenberg, and the flashy intro to Walt's compulsive purchase of twin musclecars for him and his son. These flashes of humour throughout the series really lift the dramatic content too.
If you've never watched BB, but have ever wondered what all the fuss was about (like I did for 10 years), just buy the boxset and start binging. I defy you to be disappointed. I luv this best tv show on par with game of thrones Best actor on tv. Hands down. We witnessed a legendary legend at work ladies and gentleman. Best show ever on tv and will be forever nothing can beat it for next century Breaking Bad has completely changed the way I view people that are seemingly bad. Although Walter has done horrible things throughout the show, the chemical analogy makes one believe that it was just a matter of one element (Walt) being exposed to factors (poverty, being powerless) it shouldn't have. The show raises many philosophical question about human nature. It was a pleasure watching. The hype about this show was such that my expectations were high, I admit, but overall I think this show is just 'good', rather than the brilliant object of adoration it seems to hold in many viewers hearts. Excellently acted, it nevertheless has so many plot holes I struggled to maintain a 'willing suspension of disbelief'. Without a spoiler warning I won't go into specifics but too many protagonists act out of character too often to make this as superb as it's portrayed. I'm aso surprised at how slow some episodes were and, dare I say it, even boring at times. While I think this series is littered with poor writing and is hugely overrated I would say that overall the show is worth a watch. It's popular, different and generally entertaining. **SPOILERS** It's a great show, okay? Just a couple of small gripes that to me should have been corrected. First in the fact that it was totally unnecessary to kill Mike, and unbelievable, to boot. We're supposed to buy it that Walt has it in him to take Mike's gun from his GO bag and then shoot him? Like Mike just lets it happen? Next, he's supposed to be able to pick up and carry, and then load Mike's body into his car? Mike was made out of barbed wire and spring steel - Walt was in remission from cancer. Does anyone think they can go through concentrated cancer treatment and stay strong? was Walt EVER strong? A chemistry teacher? the entire scenario was ridiculous - got it? <br/><br/>Next, killing Andrea was also stupid; yeah, Gilligan, stupid. Why? because she was standing on a lit up front porch when that psychopath Todd calmly shoots her in the back of the head. They could have easily been seen by anyone looking out their window. Any good criminal knows that you NEVER kill if you don't have to. When they do that, Jessie HAS to assume that they'll also kill Brock, right? All they had to do was POINT the gun at her; they would have owned him from then on. Also, in the final scenes, the impact of killing her has to be magnified. Anyone who thought Jessie had any place to go has been doing too much "Baby Blue". Who's gonna help him? Badger or Skinny Pete? They'd just gotten ten grand apiece to blow on Blue; ANYONE ELSE? NOPE.<br/><br/>The last two episodes would have been a great place to clear up any other loose ends, but mostly to finally give a good back story to Walt and how he came to the start of the story. It's not hard to imagine, but, this show could easily have carried two 2-hour sendoff episodes and done it right. To extend the series by a year and then not do so is just dumb.<br/><br/>Stupid mistakes in a great show. A high school chemistry teacher diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer turns to manufacturing and selling methamphetamine in order to secure his family's future.A high school chemistry teacher diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer turns to manufacturing and selling methamphetamine in order to secure his family's future.A high school chemistry teacher diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer turns to manufacturing and selling methamphetamine in order to secure his family's future.A high school chemistry teacher diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer turns to manufacturing and selling methamphetamine in order to secure his family's future. The series about Walter White, who is a chemist, and he has been diagnosed with cancer. So he turns he's life upside-down and starts to make methanol with his old student Jesse Pinkman. And why, you may ask, is Walter doing this, to his wife Skyler, his boy Walter Jr. and to his daughter, who hasn't born yet.<br/><br/>Vince Gilligan, the creator off this series, had a simple plot and made it a unique one. Uniqueness in the series is in the characters. Bryan Cranston is a wonderful Walter White. The way he made the character in to his own, is still a mystery. We see Walters light side on all of the episodes, but when he is dark, he really is dark. The dark side is what you wait to see from a teacher and Bryan is great at it.<br/><br/>Aaron Paul is great as Jesse Pinkman. Aaron character is wise, alone and very powerful. Aaron has a way off making the character live to his expectations. Jesse is a very alone guy, who is only trying to stay alive and make it in life, but there a obstacles on the road.<br/><br/>Dave Porter, who has made the music, is great on this series. The cinematographers had a great way to make the viewer see what they needed to see. And the series director are all one of a kind on Breaking Bad.<br/><br/>I think that in the past ten years or so, the TV-series has become, and still are becoming, even better than movies. In movies you have to be excited only for a couple off hours. In a series, like this one, you get to be excited, anxious and even tense for a whole year. You have to wait for a whole week to see the next episode and wait for a whole year that the show will continue.<br/><br/>This series is definitely one of a kind. First of all I should say that "only" 10 rating is not enough for this show,just due to Breaking Bad IMDb should increase max. rating to more than 10 because I have rated many things 10 before but believe me those things were no where close to Breaking Bad.So either I have to change those ratings to less than 10 or IMDb should increase max. rating and I am sure many people think the same. Now about the show I will say that it is the most reasonable show I have ever seen Every event has a reason of why its happening and how its happening.Its like watching a real life happening.This is the most important reason why I like this show the most. The actors are wonderful,outstanding,superb and mind blowing.Everyone has done their role with excellence.But most beautiful actors are both the lead Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul.Its so pleasing and interesting to watch the duo on screen.Their chemistry is out of this world,each second they act together on screen its like gem. There is lot to say about the show and I can ramble on paragraphs and paragraphs but keeping it to this much only I would like to add this that if you haven't watched any show in your lifetime and you know you are going to be dead in some days and also you want your last days to be amazing than this must be the show you should watch. This serial has been Bad example for the others so that they should improve themselves to reach the new standards set by legendary serial BB.<br/><br/>it would be great to see whole cast (except death ones) in new serial "Better Call Saul" where they can extend the story. <br/><br/>in my opinion, Serial shows what will happen when ordinary people face serious health problems if they don't have enough financial source to afford the cost. People will better die instead of making a big hole in their family budget. Economical problems will lead people to Break Bad where they only can find temporary solutions with no happy end. I have NEVER been a fan for the type of TV series where you HAVE to watch every episode to understand what exactly is going on. I also personally don't like being obligated to watch every episode in chronological order especially when each episode is 45 minutes long or more. Thats quite a bit of time I have to commit to the series. <br/><br/>This has been the first series that I have watch all the way through. Binged watched actually. So far, other than sitcoms, Breaking Bad is the only drama series that I have watched every episode, which totals out to be 1 day 22 hours and 30 minutes of non-stop viewing. <br/><br/>It was worth it! Breaking Bad is a show that stays with you for a long time even after you finished all the seasons. It is brilliant writing, acting and keeps you wondering what's going to happen next. <br/><br/>I must admit my first shot at watching BB did not go well. I found the first episodes quite boring and didn't feel that interested in watching any more. Months later I decided to give it another try and I'm so glad I did. This is one of those shows that you can watch 5 episodes in an evening and feel like you can't wait for the next night to watch some more. <br/><br/>I have watched BB all the way through twice. Once on my own and once again with my partner who I persuaded to watch it with me. He is very fussy when it comes to TV shows and does not get drawn into them easily but, like me, he was hooked on this. <br/><br/>Like any other TV series BB does have its boring parts but this more than makes up for it with the rest of the show. The thing, the 'only' thing, I didn't like about AMC's TV series was that you had to watch them in succession; and, at the time "The Sopranos" and "Breaking Bad" came out, I didn't have On Demand, so, I missed a few episodes.<br/><br/>Anyhow, after watching various episodes of both shows, I knew that they were great, so...I bought the DVD series when they were available and watched them in order.<br/><br/>This is an impeccable show with great characters and crew, and, some, not so great as with any show (villains and pain-in-the-butt characters); but, overall, I dare anyone to top this show.<br/><br/>Can anyone believe that the creator/writer/director of this show wrote the script for the movie "Hancock;" and, later, "Better Call Saul!?!?" Vince Gilligan is very much like Quentin Tarantino - a 'do-it-all-yourself' kinda guy.<br/><br/>Did anyone ever notice that the actor of Walter White was in "Saving Private Ryan" and "Malcolm in the Middle" (very versatile actor); the actor of Mike Ehrmantraut was in "Beverly Hills Cop;" the actor of Hank Schrader was in "The Negotiator;" and, the actor of Gustavo 'Gus' Fring was in "Trading Places?" I love figuring out 'who is who' in movies and TV shows, and, this is a 'who's who' of great actors!<br/><br/>This is an incredible TV series...and, if you like directors such as Quentin Tarantino, Martin Scorsese, Sam Peckinpah, Clint Eastwood, Oliver Stone, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, and, Guy Ritchie...and, the minds of Alfred Hitchcock, George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, and, Rod Serling - you'll certainly like this TV series...guaranteed! :)<br/><br/>This series could'a and should'a went on much, much longer! I have always been meaning to review Breaking Bad, and with its two-year anniversary coming up this year I thought I would reflect on life without Breaking Bad.<br/><br/>If you have never watched Breaking Bad or have intended on watching it but never got around to it, the main message that I want to get out is, it is a show that you have to watch. If you tell me that I never get around to watching a TV series, I will immediately shut you up say, Breaking Bad has to be an exception. There are only a handful of shows that come close to the competing to Breaking Bad with Game of Thrones being equal in amazingness in my opinion. The amount of themes Breaking Bad directly and indirectly touch on is astonishing and is the main reason as to why I adore the show. That and the in-depth characterisation, compelling storyline and episodes and scenes that literally take your breath away (for those who have finished, Ozymandias, Crawl Space, Face-off, To'hajiilee are just some of the greatest pieces of entertainment that I have ever witnessed which is on the scale of both movies, TV shows and video games). <br/><br/>I have never and will never forget Breaking Bad, even if later down the track a TV show does beat it in terms of my own personal taste of entertainment. At the moment, Breaking Bad will always remain on par with other amazing TV shows such as Game of Thrones. <br/><br/>If you haven't watched it yet, I promise you will have the best time watching it. Don't think it's an easy watch, they deal with many themes and many scenes will make you toss and turn in bed but it is worth it. You also have to sit and absorb the series to fully comprehend it. The one person I know who hasn't liked it, passively watched the show and knew heaps of spoilers. <br/><br/>Once you've finished, Better Call Saul is one season into the series and is a perfect spin off for Breaking Bad and stands on its own as a series. <br/><br/>10+ out of 10 for Breaking Bad The only star lacking in my rating is due to the slow parts in the White family & household scenes. I found myself thinking " get on with it!", then I started to just fast-forward thru that. Otherwise, just great writing. Usually I find something implausible but Mr Gilligan did a great job. The X-files never really caught my attention but now I'll have to start watching that show. Great casting as well. At first, I couldn't stop thinking about Bryan Cranston as the goofy dad in "Malcom in the middle" or as the converted dentist in Sienfeld but before I realized it Cranston was & always be Mr White... until the next great role he plays. All I heard for months was what a great series this show is and after watching pretty much the entire thing in the span of 3 weeks (I know, but it was winter break for my school and I love movies) I was not disappointed in the slightest. I rarely found anything wrong in the acting or script. Very minimal awkward moments.<br/><br/>The only thing I wish that didn't happen was that awkward lull in the middle of the series where it became kind of a "same sh*t different episode" although I have rarely found the series that can pull off not doing that.<br/><br/>Bryan Cranston has shown a side I always knew possible and I am just happy he found it. Him and Aaron Paul are phenomenal actors and I hope to see more of them thanks to this.<br/><br/>In short, it's definitely worth your time and if it wasn't for the fact that it's really long and I have things to do with my life I would sit down and watch it all over again. Watch it and love it and welcome to the club. this one of the best shows out there it comes second after the walking dead for me it has an excellent acting skills from a very talented actors and the episodes are emotional and very good action an drama. personally like the fact they pull no punches. I find myself pausing at the fact that I am so intrigued by this hard core street wise program, more than any of the other big name series. This one really hits home and gives a true behind the scenes look at what most would consider the bad guys. I'm not condoning the contents of the story, and I don't think the show is either, there is no glamor in what these boys are doing, but it's giving an insight to the darker side of many streets. Most of our Critics here possibly have been around 1 or 2 of these characters in real life.. for whatever reasons who knows.. I would think some of you have and then again maybe not. I have... and to say this story doesn't draw you in because of that fact of knowing some Meth. addicts would be lying!! If by chance you have known anybody or been around anybody that struggles with this terrible addiction then maybe you can relate to the series. If you haven't then you'll get a good lesson on the in's and out's of what this "fictional in a lot of ways" story is about. I think everybody evolved in creating this series should be given credit for creating a very believable character that being Walter White has been screwed around by a lot of so called friends and why should today be any different then the next for him who just cares about his Family... and they just care about getting by on a day to day basis... kinda like we all try to do if we can.... and we're all trying to survive life the best we can right? Well we try each and every day to deal with life's addictions... and for Walter White the only addiction he has is the love of his Family and keeping them happy and safe... so he thinks at least until his life takes an unexpected turn. So we live each day the best we can....it don't always work out that way for some reason though does it... especially for Walter White anyway. Sorry just ranting here... anyway.. Great directing!!... and for sure some of the best acting I've seen by all the cast members.. and when I say all... I mean all of the them regardless of their small roles or large. Simply a great job of television work on all the episodes and the phenomenal way of drawing you in at the end of each show is unprecedented. Thank you for all 5 seasons.... it was educational and very entertaining and has a place in my Family's lives right now... and some of the people we know and love!! Thank you Vince Gilligan and all the other people involved and I mean all of you.... you just may have possibly saved some lives from this terrible drug.. possibly... let's hope so... Hail the King!! You gotta take your laptop with your booming headphones and sit down for hours cuz all that what happens in there won't let you move your head even an inch. A perfect blend of picturization,story,thrill all together with a set of excellent characters bringing out "THE BEST" compilation of crime drama ever seen!! The best part is the sequence of the story, you can never predict what's next and its always the beginning of the episode giving the thrill. You can't skip this series if you are a thriller freak. Excellent work!! Hope it would have continued forever!! Hats off for Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul for their work and to all crew members!! Breaking Bad is what I consider thee greatest show ever aired, while many would disagree they couldn't say it was anything less of incredible. The first scene, a man looking at what he's done scared and upset, to the last scene, with the grin and happiness he's long sought. While the show is very linear there are subplots they create and get rid of. The acting is 10/10 Emmy worthy, I love Malcolm in the Middle and all I can say is, wow. What a transformation. Cranston has always either captivated me or had me laughing in tears. Every character feels so necessary and needed to continue a great story. While Skylar can get annoying you can't help but feel for her. Walter Jr exaggerates his disease perfectly, and Jesse, ooh Jesse. This man sold me from the start that he would be amazing. Each character develops over time and I'd say he (a tad more than Walt) has the largest transformations. Before I watched Breaking Bad on Netflix I'd never seen any of these actors besides Cranston, and now I love all of em. Walt is a guy who you shouldn't root for but you do through the entire series, and when you don't believe me it's very short lived. Every action has a consequence, and the "answer man" as Mike says can either avoid them or fix them. From police to dealers to his partner. If you never seen this show and are hesitant to watch it. Sit down, get a drink and some popcorn, watch the entire first 7 episode season and see why this show is so highly praised. I caught wind of the popularity of Breaking Bad after an interest created by the shows original advertising. However it was not on at a time I could watch. But when it became available on NetFlix to stream I decided to watch it. Great decision! Breaking Bad is overall possibly the most satisfying show I've ever watched. There is an element of everyman in the story in that our main character is a man of potential who was persuaded to take the risk adverse path in life and now finds himself with terminal cancer and the very common reality of bad insurance after a lifetime of hard work, all that is going to leave his family with nothing and him dying a miserable death at the hands of the cure. A very real story grounded in most peoples mind through relations and seeing this horrible story play out. Granted not everyone has the missed chance to have been part of a hugely successful corporation, but everyone had regrets. Age and hindsight at missed opportunities are simply part of life, Walter White's were just of having given up his share in a billion dollar corporation to settle for teaching high school and struggling financially through his sons expensive health. All the foundation for a story that may be born of middle age regrets resolved, but what a great ride. There are several layers to the story. W.W. being a good father, good guy with regrets, facing death and a bad HMO. The "average guy" going rouge and creating more money in a few years than he can even launder doing what would consider immoral. Then the effects on the man from being an average guy "taking what the world dumps on him" turning him into his alias "Heisenberg" which he chooses as an ironic name but by the end of the series has lost his moral direction in becoming a drug lord supplying crystal meth to the southwest and eastern Europe making hundreds of millions. The thing that makes this show great is how it hits home with real life subjects at the same time as taking us on a wild ride in so many directions that it is amazing that they wrote this series with these many story lines and yet managed to bring closure to every important one in a satisfying way. The bizarre relationship between Jesse and his former teacher Walter White ("Mr. White" LOL!!!) to Heisenberg who would do just about anything to secure money to care for his family but in the end unable to give them a penny of the hundreds of millions he made while losing himself in a life of mass production of an incredibly pure form of crystal meth. The show is one wild ride in which we are drawn in to care about the characters yet resolve ourselves to certain realities like the one that W.W. must die. No other show I've ever watched has managed to draw me in to care so much and manage to bring closure to most every aspect of the many story lines created and by the end closed with authority. Aside from our last views of Jesse riding off into the night, we know that he is free. The final episode left me numb for quite some time, and the choice of 'baby blue' as the song to play during those last few minutes as the magnitude of what just had happened sank in was brilliant. Walter White becoming Heisenberg had become a slave to the pride he took in his blue meth that took the streets by storm and made him rich beyond imagination with money he couldn't spend or leave to those he loved. But he went out on his terms taking out those who deserved it and setting free those who deserved it. There are few exceptional shows any longer, but Breaking Bad would get an 11 on a 10 point scale if possible for among the many shows and movies I have been captivated by in my over half century walking this earth, none had quite the effect of Breaking Bad and managed to finish what it started so thoroughly.<br/><br/>Watch it, savor every moment, there will only be one first time!!!! I must start by saying that Breaking Bad is the best show on TV i ever watched.<br/><br/>I heard about this since it started it's 2nd season, everywhere wonderful review, really good critics, and high IMDb rating, but i just let it slip since i didn't think this is that good.<br/><br/>But a few weeks back when i heard that Breaking Bad ended it was every where and that is when i decided to give it a go, so i bought it and it blew (especially after i watched the first season).<br/><br/>Today i completed watching it and I'm really happy that i did and sad that it drew me inside and like every time you watch something you think what next, what now after this.<br/><br/>Now, i think AMC is the network for mind blowing shows Madmen, Low Winter Sun, The Walking Dead... and the greatest of all Breaking Bad.<br/><br/>This show has everything packed in, everything you look for in a good show, Very good cast (characters), writing, directing, story, layer upon layer carefully placed, nicely developed... just great.<br/><br/>Keep up the good work and bring us the good shows AMC. I don't think there can be enough praise in the world that I can give to this show. It's nothing short of perfection. I started watching on Netflix about a week and half ago, and I've just finished all 5 seasons today. Yep, I've lost my job because of all the sickies I've been pulling since watching ;) It's like a good book you can't put down, you get so involved with the story and characters and you can't bear to put it down. The writing is superb and all the actors were brilliant. Cranston and Paul are two of the greatest actors I've ever seen, and their performances were worthy of every award nomination and win that they received. Same goes for the show in general. I haven't seen anything like it and I doubt I ever will again.<br/><br/>Honestly, do yourself a favor - watch this show. You'll be seeing something truly spectacular. Often at times the standard of writing and acting in TV series can be sub par, however from the the initial synopsis you can tell this was a thought provoking labor of love. And if this series was going to everything the writer and director hoped it would be, it would needed everyone to be on there game and Bryan Cranston was from start to finish. In my option Aaron Paul grew as an actor as did his character throughout the show and the relationship between the two of them really took you through all the emotions possible. I am sure you will have heard a lot about this series and it's never really advised to believe the hype and more take the journey and judge for yourself and enjoy. I haven't seen a perfect structure like this in my whole life. Astonishing plot, hilarious directing, fabulous performance. All these assemble together forming this splendid show. How would angels become devils and devils become angels! This evil which is inside all of us varies from someone to another. Some people can restrain it. Others surrender to it letting it ruin their lives. How can this evil justify every sinful deed we do! Pride, desire, arrogance and selfishness how can they destroy someone's life even if they were protected by extreme caution and intelligence. All these questions were put up in this show in a perfect way. <br/><br/>Although I don't like watching series as much as I like watching movies, I haven't enjoyed anything like this before. I have fallen in love with the figures that I was very sad at the last episode because I didn't want it to end, moreover, I have watched this whole series in only 7 days. Ik had the luck that when VPRO started Breaking Bad they aired a week long every evening at 23:00 hours a episode of the Season one. At the start I realised that I've never seen anything that was comparable. There was comedy there was suspense. There was a normal family with his ups and downs. There was a brother in law at the DEA who had a very good relationship with his brother in law who gets into crime. But what was most astonishing was the fact that i could remember every episode. All of that beautiful filmed with sometimes surprisingly camera-shots and angles. Normally I watch a series but after a while the details and storyline are out of memory. Not with Breaking Bad. Every episode will stuck in your mind. The best thing you can do is sit down watch Breaking Bad and it will come in your live. All good things must end and sadly now the final episode was shown 11/5/2014. I'm looking forward to buy the Barrel so I can watch it again in remembrance of the Best Show I've ever seen Me and my partner sat and watched this together, we got addicted by just the first episode. The journey of the characters is phenomenal, how your opinion changes from one extreme to the other. Especially Walter White. <br/><br/>I can't believe the difference in Walter from me wanting him to be not caught, then towards the end me wanting him dead. His character changed drastically, he became a evil, selfish aggressive man. <br/><br/>And the journey of Jesse is always exciting and intense, with him battling his drug addiction time and time again, then his journey of being forced into things he doesn't want to do. <br/><br/>Vince Gilligan is a very talented man, and has made a bloody good series. I've watched it all once, and no doubt about it I will be watching all over again, I've recommended it to everyone I know because it was probably the best series I've watched EVER!! <br/><br/>Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul WOW! Fantastic actors. A true phenomenon. Just finished watching this masterpiece. I think it deserves every accolade going including an Oscar. Hard to describe how one feels after the last and final episode finished. The writing, the acting, the directing, the skill, the list goes on.. how on earth can anyone top this I don't know!!!! LOVED IT LOVED IT LOVED IT!!!!<br/><br/>The baddies were really bad. The actors top class each and everyone of them even the Baby acted on cue! The series took you on a roller coaster journey. Just as you thought you had it figured out it smacked you with something else. <br/><br/>Where do we go from here? I would have liked to have known what happens to the characters afterwards. Just a few loose ends. Breaking Bad is by far the best show ever created, The writing is just brilliant, the acting just fantastic with such a huge sense of realism. The show would not be at all the same with out it's amazing writer Vince Gilligan, and it's extremely talented actors/actresses especially Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul, and Dean Norris. You just get sucked into the show and can't stop watching, the show just he's more and more action packed every single episode building up to the shocking final season.<br/><br/>Everything about the show is perfect, it's sad to see the show is over and to know there will never be anything else on television up to the extremely high standards of Breaking Bad. Today (22/04/2014), i watched the last episode of the most awesome TV series that i ever watched! I'm crazy about series, i watch every kind with no restrictions, but no other series let me so speechless. The amazing performances from the actors, the complexity and transformation of the characters, the realism of the plot, the perfectionist way that the story is conducted, all the construction and development, every single detail was extremely well "architected" by the director, Vince Gilligan. A mixture of drama, suspense, psychological thriller, with the right pinch of comedy and action who makes you tense from the beginning to the end. Every new season is better than the previous and the series finale closes the story in a epic way. No wonder that Breaking Bad won so many awards, 63 at total in these 5 seasons. No wonder too, that even before the series ends, it was already considered cult. I highly recommend. I'm already missing Walt, Jesse, Saul, Gus, Mike, Hank, Albuquerque, Blue Crystal and everything about this series... Breaking bad it's not just a series. It is a work of art. "I am the one who knocks". It's more then excellent, it's a master piece. I never heard about this series until a few weeks ago, here in EU you don't get the change to see them all. If you are here it is because you heard about it and probably currently watching it or heard someone talking about these series. The only think i can tell, go tell other people about this series, as you now you will understand it's unbeatable insane good written 5 seasons catching drama. The story, the character development, the setting, music, locations, reality, it has so many elements in to it, that no episode is boring and everything just sums how it should and what you just never have seen before.

The most beautiful TV Series Ever I never seen a TV Series Like This Bomb! My rating: 9001/10. Over 9000! I used to think that Game Of Thrones, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Star Trek: The Next Generation were the three best TV shows ever made, but Breaking Bad is on a whole other level, the level of genius is out of this world. It's the only TV show I've seen that cannot be rated simply a 10. Giving it a 10/10 only gives it an "excellent" rating, it's much more than that, it's a masterpiece among masterpieces. I've seen hardcore fans of: Star Trek, Game Of Thrones, Star Wars, Walking Dead admit that Breaking Bad is much, much better, so much better it cannot even be compared. The skills of the camera team are the best I have ever seen. The actors are the best I have ever seen. The music is the best ever. The story will stay with me for the rest of my life. The script is mind boggling. Breaking bad is so powerful that it will change the way I live my life forever.<br/><br/>I also used to think that the actor Bryan Cranston, the main actor in Breaking Bad was a terrible actor. I could not have been more wrong. The only reason why Bryan Cranston was terrible is because the TV show Malcolm in the Middle destroyed his reputation in my eyes.<br/><br/>The show also even contains hidden subliminal messages, flashes of information on the screen, quick references to libertarian politics and was most probably written by a libertarian who follows the Austrian School of economic thought. I could clearly sens the social and economic awareness of the author throughout the show, pure genius. There were also references to former congressman Ron Paul, my all time favorite politician. The writing never falters throughout the course of the five seasons.the show goes on we realize that there's a lot more to his character than just a clever chemist trying to leave a legacy. First you will like this guy Walter White, then you will pity him, then you start feeling good for him when he starts becoming a bad-ass, then you will despise him for he goes too far too brutal in his actions.It's a fantastic concept and watching a character develop and change. AS WALTER SAID-CHEMISTRY IS A STUDY OF MATTER....AND WHAT HE PREFER TO SEE IT AS A CHANGE...THIS WHOLE LINE EXPLAINS EVERY SINGLE ASPECT OF HIS LIFE.... AND I FLATTER WHAT VINCE SHOWS US THE REALITY NOT A FANTASY WORLD....<br/><br/>Its not just a TV show Breaking Bad is an experience. #‎BreakingBad‬ - All Bad things must come to an end.<br/><br/>>>>>SPOILER ALRET<<<< I'm going to give a long review here. so Prepare yourself, if u like to see my opinion. First of all a very big ‪#‎hug‬ ‪#‎Respect‬ to Vince Gilligan - Man who started it all. one of the best TV show i have ever watched. Suggestion from members and IMDb Rating, I started watching this TV series. Before I started watching this TV series, I read the story plot in IMDb and I wondered , how a drug dealing story plot will have above 9 rating ? so I kept all my thoughts aside and give it a try. Well, it was a worth a try. Yeah ! From beginning to end , it just made my days better, whenever I watched it. Normally all TV serials , starts off in a good note , but later it will lose its track and the creators somehow wanted to end it before it's losing its fans. Here things are entirely different. this one started as good, and gone to better and ended as best. Not the very simple best , but the extreme best . It's so rare to achieve the 100 % satisfaction , but this show made so near to it. The way Vince wrote the screenplay and handling the characters at most at the best. He did lot of home work I think. I can see so much effort in there. Mostly, it's so rare to see Movies/TV serials based on a dry lands , but this TV series crew made the show, so interesting, by shooting the series in the dry areas. This crew deserves a lot of respect. Most of the time , I can't able to guess what happens. yes, the element of surprise is mostly there to amaze me. only in few areas I guessed what happens next. this show have sentiments, emotional, action, thriller etc., Also it projected how cancer can turn the things up , how a normal man become a don of an empire, how he to do things to cover a lie , to cover a single lie many lies are introduced. One of the main thing about this show is , THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE - it bought so many fans and Also BryanCranston (W.W). There are few loops there, but that doesn't matter a bit when we have such fantastic screenplay.<br/><br/>Never thought a drug based story was this much interesting . As for entertainment it's OK to enjoy and we all support WW , but in social view i didn't want any of this to happen.<br/><br/>I need to mention about the lead actors here .They did a great job in placing this TV SHOW In the crown of the king. ‪#‎BryanCranston‬ (Walter White) - known him through this series only. When started, he looked like a normal guy and somewhat I remember that, he had that comedy image around him for almost before he started acting in this show. certainly I don't know about that. that's turned out to be good for me. I enjoyed his performance when seasons pass by and every time he amazed, stunned me by his unbeaten acting. he had shown the exact body symptoms and body language for a person who suddenly came to know his cancer and the way he dealt with it was simply superb . In last season , in last few episodes , he showed the true dedication and true character by making differences in appearances.<br/><br/>‪#‎AaronPaul‬ (Jesse Pinkman) - This man also impressed me with his acting skills. he got real talent in him . hope his future projects bring that out. About his character , he gave his best performance and one thing I didn't like is , he's getting emotional too soon. that's kind of odd for me to watch it repeatedly. Apart from that he's best. to say the truth means, I kind of like his acting more than Bryan cranston.<br/><br/>‪#‎GiancarloEsposito‬ (Gustavo Fring) : One cool villain character for show like this. Almost had his coolness up to most of the time and shown his anger face at the end. his look, his way of dressing , way of speaking, liked all of it. One calm villain i have ever seen.<br/><br/>‪#‎AnnaGunn‬ ( Skyler White) : Perfect house wife at sometimes and over reacting house wife some times. At one stage, kind of hated her , but at her point of view and what she was trying to do , made sense and started to like her character slowly.<br/><br/>‪#‎BobOdenkrik‬ (Saul Goodman) : "Better call Saul" . One of the brilliant lawyer character i have ever seen. The way speaks , the metaphor he uses to mention things were awesome , catchy and spicy. Without him most of the things in this show wouldn't be possible in moving the story line. I'm addicted to his metaphor. As WW said , "You are full of colorful metaphors, aren't you Saul ? ‪#‎DeanNorris‬ (Hank) , ‪#‎BetsyBrandt‬ (Marie) ‪#‎RJMite‬ (Walter White Jr.) ‪#‎JonathanBanks‬ (Mike) did their part well. I watched the whole series, and I still watch it; can't stop no matter how hard I try to stop thinking about it. But easily its hands-down the best show I've ever seen. But I more than recommend it, you have to watch this show before you die. Its so good, that you can't spoil it--you have to see it to believe it. The acting is so good, that its super believable--everyone puts 100% love and effort into making each second of it. But its not just the acting and effort. It is even artistic in every way, and haven't seen as much art in any movie or TV show in my life, since the art in this is beautiful and unbelievable; touched up with the perfect songs for each scene. The amazing series ended with an equally impressive episode, which connected all of the flashforwards we'd seen and methodically led to the story's conclusion. It gave us closure on everyone we cared about – and satisfyingly finished off the ones we really wanted to see put in the ground.<br/><br/>"I did it for me," Walt said, and there you have it: the dark pit of the soul of "Breaking Bad." Walt was never good. Walt chose evil. "I liked it. I was good at it. And I was really — " and here he paused. "I was alive." It's remarkable to think back on all five seasons of "Breaking Bad" and see so many perfect notes like that, so much pit-stained anxiety, so much confidence in the story that it set out to tell, but also so much confidence on the part of Gilligan and his writers to let the story tell them where it wanted to go. Bored with the usual stuffs? Then this is the one for you.Perfect! piece of gem! Complete package ! <br/><br/>Breaking Bad == Superb plot + Outstanding acting by Bryan Cranston + Kickass story line + Bone-chilling moments + Unexpected twists and turns + Love + Emotions + Psychic behavior of Cranston + Comedy.<br/><br/>Since the day I watched First episode, Cranston has occupied special place in me because of his mesmerizing acting, I'm astonished that how a person can be so involved with his role like this.Aaron Paul's acting is really cool and you'll see the complete involvement with his role.<br/><br/>This TV show itself is like a drug.I was and I am highly addicted to this TV show.I feel to watch it again and again.It's impossible to take Bryan Cranston out of your mind. I was first introduced to Breaking Bad through my friend. I thought," Bryan Cranston doing a serious role? He will fail." I was a big Malcolm in the middle fan and was used to him being the stupid father. I was wrong. He did excellent in his role of Walter White. And the rest of the cast is perfect. It has deep characters that you get invested into, and moments that just make you go," did that just happen?" It will always keep you guessing. This is why it is the best show ever. Aaron Paul was pretty much what you would imagine a drug dealing failure of a student to be. This show is also very realistic. You finish an episode, go outside and think to yourself," and this really happens?" If you decide to watch this show. Say good bye to your social life. i am a high school student who was taking honors chemistry when someone told me about this show on netflix. the first weekend i sat down to watch an episode i ended up watching the entire first season. this show is something completely different. the plot is so elaborate and well thought out, it feels like an endless movie more than a TV show. the way vince gilligan was able to create a show that contained every time of emotion you can feel is truly amazing. i became a huge fan of this show and after watching the first episode i was hooked until the end. brian cranston does am amazing job as walter white and is able to depict this moral transformation that white goes through in a way i have never seen before on a television screen. this show has set the bar for future televion. honestly no other show is even close. breaking bad is without a doubt a 10, and even though amc's other show "the walking dead" is great, its a 6 compared to gilligans masterpiece. I've never seen a show so perfectly executed. i made an IMDb account just so i could review the best thing television has ever seen. The story line make me to want more and more. I want to see every small detail form this TV series because the producer was extremely careful to details if you watch when you are disconnected from your daily concerns you will see all the evidence left by the characters some times you see something that will be an important clue in the investigation that the camera does not focus on it but is in a light that make you to remember the thing till finely it come and make a change in the life of Walter and Skyler White, Jesse Pinkman and Hank and Marie Schrader and the other characters. I'm still viewing the TV Show and I hope that the end will be as original as before and will not be a clichÃ© like the other movies and TV Shows I follow before. Thank you for reading my review and I strongly recommend this TV SHOW! Breaking Bad is iconic in the way it altered the lead character Walter White (played excellently by Bryan Cranston) in appearance, both physically and metaphysically. Jesse Pinkman (played as unreliably as the character itself by Aaron Paul) lends himself to Walter's increasingly atrocious plans with the zeal "totally" becoming of a drug user. Giancarlo Esposito deserves the next mention for pulling off the hidden-behind-pastel-shades evil character with aplomb. The cast is exceptionally talented and the performances match up to their status, if not elevate it. Directors from Mad Men etc. give certain episodes their own spin, sometimes literally, and point-of-views and tracking shots complement the excellent cinematography, making full use of the dreary, dry, impersonal setting of the desert.<br/><br/>As for the story, watch it! :) I personally fast-forward through Skyler/Marie sister talks, but that's just my anxiety to see the action ASAP. I have ticked the "Contains spoilers" button just so first-time viewers may watch without preconceived notions, as that sets up the plot twists and random coincidences very well. Thank you, thank you, thank you to the makers of Breaking Bad for giving us an ending that was completely satisfying (screw you Sopranos, Dexter, Seinfeld etc.).<br/><br/>Thank you for not staying to long. You never made crap just because you could make money by staying on the air for longer.<br/><br/>Thank you for starting out as a extremely good show and only get better as it went along.<br/><br/>This show was like reading great literature. The story was great, but so much was going on on different levels.<br/><br/>May be the greatest work of art ever on TV. The Show Is Killer Seriously,Delight And Wonderful Every Imaginable Way And Show Never Lost Its Height Or May Not Being Dull At All & Its Making Fly You High For Days Only One Bump And Telling You What Mr.Gilligan's Best Work Be Careful When You Saw It You'll Never Gonna Regret This At All.<br/><br/>When You At The End Of The Journey Just Check Your Heart Beat Raises Like You Never Seen Before Just Chill Your Heart Beat Stops But You Not Gonna Die Watching This Just Because Show Won't Let You Just Because You Won't Believe In But Show Must Let You Believing In It.<br/><br/>All Credit Goes To Creator Vince Gilligan For Making A Stunning Breaking Bad Life Lifestyle And LifeCycle Alive And Cast Is Not So Good But Great Awesome Never Gets Too Old. <br/><br/>At Last I Make Sure You Remember His Name!!!! To be honest this show has a very boring and dragging on first season. But you must watch this as it is very important to the show. As soon as season 2 starts THIS SHOW IS AS ADDICTING AS IT CAN GET. A mix of drama , action and some suspense. This show is very intriguing and can get you confused at times with some of Walters Bold decisions , that You begin to understand later on in the show. Walter is a very unpredictable character as well as the show is. I highly recommend you watch this , well worth the watch. GREAT SHOW. If you are wondering "why I decided to continue watching after season 1 ? " I decided to keep watching because I was told by a friend that it evades its slow paced first season and becomes a lot more interesting and intense. Evil isn't a light switch, it's a journey and it's a journey that Walter White has been on since the story began. Walter White could have gone far in life as a scientist but instead he took the easy path and became a lowly high school science teacher with a disabled son and another child on the way. Then he discovers he is dying from lung cancer. What is a man to do? Well this man starts to manufacture meth as a way to cushion his family for when he is gone. This show is very dark and yet very well written. There is not a needless character in the story. From the brother-in-law DEA agent to the wily lawyer, from the increasingly suspicious wife to the Ne'er-do-well business partner, Everyone has a purpose. In essence you are watching something truly beautiful. A good man breaking bad.....and taking everyone else down with him. Breaking Bad puts a whole new perspective on any television series before it. This action/adventure goes places that other television shows wouldn't even dare to look. Walter White (Bryan Cranston), a high school chemistry teacher, is diagnosed with terminal cancer. With a pregnant wife and son with cerebral palsy, he knows he needs to make some quick money to support them after he is gone. He quickly falls into the drug world with a former student of his, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), cooking and selling one of the most potent and dangerous drugs known to man, methamphetamine. While he is trying to make a more stable life for his family, he must watch as his own life spirals out of control. actors are fantastic in this thrilling melting pot of intrigue and mystery. cranston knows what's up in this modern classic as he faces moral dilemmas and insurmountable odds. from episode to episode the action ratchets up and up fill your mind with questions and incredulous tangents. i couldn't peel my eyes from the screen, i was worried that i might hurt my eyes. all joking aside, to be alive during the premiere airing of this monumental show is a gift. every Sunday is Christmas as far as i'm concerned. but what's great about this show is in the watching of it and not the reading of this review. thought-provoking and mind-blowing. i haven't been this excited about a television program since stargate. must-see extravaganza! I got to say this is the best series i've ever seen.... I gotta like much the roles of Walter and Jesse and etc... This for me is true actors... This can be way more addictive then a random movie.... If i would classify it from 0-10 ? i give a 10 ! I think this has to be really hard making a series like this and not touching a dime...... Looks like i already think like you guys...... It's a very creative story and i can't wait to see the next episode...... Keep up the good work boys and girls, you all will be a good reference for me...... it's very recommendable.... XD.... heads up i'm no pot head as simple as that, but i gotta love the dedication..... :) A story about a chemistry teacher who learns that he has lung cancer and to support his family starts preparing the drug meth from which he hopes to earn enough money.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad has everything going for it whether its the direction or the acting or writing.This is one of the few shows which provides such a detailed character arc of all the leads. What this show does well is blend dark humor with suspense with (occasional)action with detailed character sketches.This show is all about the details, its amazing how well the script is thought out(many scenes resort to metaphors).The moral dilemmas which each character faces in many situations throughout the 4 seasons are quite intense.Many complain that this show is slow but its this slow pace which helps to build the tension.If we didn't care about the characters then why would we care about what happens next in their life and in order for us to care about the characters we need to understand them and their mindset and that is only possible if the show has a slow pace in which each actor has time to showcase their character. In season 1 walter white is this reserved chemistry teacher who loves his family and seems like a person who wont even hurt a fly but as the seasons progress he truly breaks bad and his evil side is let loose. The marvelous thing about the show is that the supporting cast is brilliant, they are not just random people who are penned down on the script just to accompany walter white in his story but they are well thought out characters who affect the whole story.<br/><br/>The acting in this show is the best you will ever see. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul are currently my 2 most favorite people in this world.They live the characters and give their characters life.Their are many tense moments in this show where the characters are in a difficult situations and they have to get out of them and these situations are really thrilling ,but what i find more thrilling is when the character has 2 choices to make and in most cases one choice is good and one choice is evil and the way the whole scenario and the moral dilemma is showcased really makes you just want to stand up and clap.<br/><br/>I truly recommend this show cause this show will absorb you into its METH world. This show might just be the best show you haven't seen!!!!! This show is better than nearly every movie coming out of Hollywood. Those clowns that spend 100 million dollars to make crappy movies that rely only on CGI and explosions could learn so much from a show that likely costs a couple million...for the whole season!!! The show has fully developed characters, incredible plot twists, slow suspense peppered with just enough shock and horror to leave you on the edge of your seat. It is also funny at times.<br/><br/>The only bad thing is each episode is so good the time flies and you must wait an entire week in suspense to watch again. Few shows in history have that quality. The only one in recent memory that was just as good and quite similar with the suspense, characters etc. was the rebooted and much darker Battlestar Galactica series that ran on Sci-Fi a few years ago (also called the best show on TV at that time by Newsweek, TV guide etc.). ....Two of the best shows I've ever seen hands down The message that the average Joe, when he's forced to make decisions, should just take the low road is Bad. You need money, your job sucks, your life is out of control - you've got two choices: stay where you are or deal meth. You can also pimp yourself middle America or you can deal weed. You can do all these things and feel redemption somehow. This isn't how real life works and it's Bad. Will Hollywood write the script about the guy who rises above it all by becoming a legitimate entrepreneur? Doubtful. For now, they'll stick with the detective who kills or the teacher who pimps, all to convince you this is all there is and that it's Good. No really, it's all Bad. I forced myself to watch all seasons just cause friends said it's getting way better on last seasons.<br/><br/>Breaking bad is not an action, adventure or thriller movie. It's just a drama, a miserable boring drama.<br/><br/>That Jesse whining all the time omg, I was like please someone kill him so won't watch more of his face.<br/><br/>I know I will get a hell of downvotes but that's ok, guess it's all about taste.<br/><br/>Making this review so people who are like me won't waste their time. Watch 2 episodes,if you don't like it then just stop watching. Nothing will change.<br/><br/>For me the best series ever is 24.
Jack Bauer is the answer, now tell me what's the question! I watch a lot of shows and when this show was recommended to me I decided to give it a chance. I wish I never did it is the worst show I've ever seen poor acting , storytelling anything a tv show needs to prosper it lacks including interesting characters 0/ 10 I began watching this and was immediately hooked. Obviously, dark issues are addressed from time to time, and mostly, the killing is in house, that is , within the circle of the drug manufacture and supply chain. Most of these were living by the sword in any case. <br/><br/>Slowly however, I felt myself less and less on Walt's side. I was well into the series, which loses momentum, but the gains it back, but then starts to deteriorate in terms of the growing collateral damage. I was well into the entire series, but enough was enough with what happened to the kid on the trail bike and, the usual "the business must continue at all costs" rational was used, which was beginning to become a justification for anything goes. Suffice to say, I felt this episode really crossed the line as to what was acceptable and what is not, and that was the end of breaking bad for me. Quite frankly, I really felt it lost the plot at this point, with no possible redemption. I knew I wanted to wait till the series finale had aired to write a review about Breaking Bad because I kept holding out to see if the show would surpass its potential like I thought it could. It never quite made it past it's potential, though parts of seasons 2,4 and 5 definitely dabbled in that territory. This is not to say that just living up to the potential isn't a bad thing. Breaking Bad was often a great show and a great story to follow along with. It also boasted two incredible performances from Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul throughout. The evolution of the series and of those two characters is something special to watch. The show never quite reaches that next level for one gaping reason, and it's partly because of it's two leads... the shows supporting characters are for the most part boring and irrelevant. When I think of some of the best dramas ever (Justified, Lost, Fringe, Damages, The Wire) the big thing that they possess that Breaking Bad doesn't are relevant characters. It's a lot easier to take your story in lot's of different directions and have relevant sup-plots when they involve characters that grab your attention. Breaking Bad struggled to have that throughout, with key supporting characters Hank, Walt Jr.,Marie, or Skyler (ohhhhh Skyler :S ) providing the spark for any good sub-plots. One great supporting character is Saul, but mainly for his comic relief. Most of Breaking Bad's supporting character's are ones with only a season or two story arc like Gus, Mike, Jane and the Salamanca's. Though the show doesn't quite get to the heights that some of other great dramas, it's still thoroughly entertaining from the opening episode to the satisfying series finale. Jessie is the only character I care about the entire series. It takes 3 entire seasons for anything interesting to happen. Half the show is boring useless scenes of eating breakfast or silence. They had an entire episode dedicated to killing a fly cause they couldn't come up with an interesting story. Ozark is 10 times better and has only been out 2 seasons and has done 10 times more development than breaking bad had in 5 seasons. There is many mistakes in the story and there is boring and boring and boring and there is many episodes is bad like the fly episode what's that that show !! Not interested and I do not approve. I do not approve of this tv show and I should not of watched it. Entertaining, but way over the top. Could the whole of the US really be this bad Haha Great TV show. Some important plots are just missing. Mad people just show everything on TV. Don't let us imagine different stories. Like how did Walter/Saul poised Brock and how did Jesse joined the dots and came to the conclusion that Walter tried to kill Brock. The vacuum cleaner guy was so damn professional but met Walter the same place where he had called Jesse. What about other 70 million dollars? They should have showed Jesse's future little bit with Brock and Elliot giving money to Walter's family. Could have shown future of Walter's family and Mike's grand daughter. I don't know why I am being asked to write more lines than this. First three seasons were awesome,Bryan Cranston did justice to his character Walter white.Only point I dint like is skyler's relationship with ted(even though it was for short duration)apart from this all three seasons are great. chemistry lecturer cooking meth to make money very interesting.<br/><br/>But I think fourth season is going out of track.....<br/><br/>but I am waiting for what would be the end as gus and walter are trying to terminate each other,also hank behind gus which would put walter in front of hanks gun.<br/><br/>trust me give a try Using an ancient theme we are treated to the same old story that dates back to Macbeth and the Greeks. It's an old tired story. Hollywood continually dishes out terrible content such as this and we eat it up. And that in itself is nothing new. This show makes you appreciate other truly unique TV shows by showing how great it is, but how old and stolen the theme has become. Everyone knows that Aaron Paul is a famous Hero of America.

Except it I also much like his dashing and smart leather jacket, hence, I wanted it in real look for my brother then finally I got it according to my want at Ultimo Fashions dot com I am happy today because my brother is happy. Was so bored. It was just Same thing over n over. Don't compare with GOT, GOT has worst ending, but breaking bad is bad all seasons Boring so much boring ðŸ˜´ðŸ’¤ when i want to watcin the morning i felt sleep ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜´ðŸ’¤ Breaking Bad is one of the best shows ever made, and by one of the best shows ever made, I mean that it is in my top 5, albeit at the bottom. There is not a season that is disappointing, but when it comes to today's audiences, they are too quick to forget that Breaking Bad is not the only TV show that's ever existed.<br/><br/>The combined annoyance of both Skylar White and to an even more extreme extent, the always annoying Marie Schrader alone take away from a lot of the show. At times the both of them are just unbearable to put it simply. It seems today people are quick to point out that Breaking Bad is the best show ever, without ever have seen shows like The Sopranos, The Wire, Oz which essentially paved the way for Breaking Bad to ever exist. One of the best series in the history but the first seasons were boring Good, but kinda annoying at times. Nagging women are totally annoying and make you wanna fast forward. But other than that quite ok bit never a 9.5. totally overrated Breaking Bad. Heard a lot about it and started watching after the show stopped airing; managed to drag till season three and could not go on anymore. It felt too slow (interestingly, I have been keeping up with The Walking Dead, which is arguably even slower and repetitive) and the story simply failed to intrigue me. It's got great acting though. Boring and boring and boring and i hate this serie ðŸ˜Œ Don't get me wrong this is still one of the best tv series shows out there, but would I watch it again second time round?! No! Can be long winded in some episodes but overall is really good and did have a really good ending unlike GOT. But as a overall series GOT is better as can be easily watched over and over again. It's mad and unfortunately we are for persisting. It's not funny. It's not clever and it breeds. I'm very sorry because obviously a lot of people love it, rightly but I don't know how. This is great TV show. We are better than this. OK so im late to the party so lets try to bullet point it.
* One of those "i will watch it soon" series for years.
* Same as Better Call Saul
* Noted BCS was a prequel to BB so tried BCS first, managed 5 episodes and slated it, 2 stars.
* Was going to give up on BB but sometimes prequels can ruin a classic, thought give BB 3 episodes and see.
* Watched the entire 62 episodes solid within 5 days.<br/><br/>Not better than "The Wire" that still remains the greatest series ever created but definitely worthy of top 3/5 status.<br/><br/>That good i could probably watch it again next week. No story is ever rushed to fit into an episode, where an episode ends might not always be where the next one begins because theres more angles to this gripping, funny yet tragic plot. You can love a character then flip and hate them. So very well written and apart from the last couple of episodes to have 5 series and only cover a 18 month span really kept it more real. Unfortunately Walt Jnr & Jessie do age more than 18 months lol but look past that and this will be a classic still in the year 2040 and onwards.<br/><br/>Brilliance at play BrBa deserves nothing less than 10/10
hell i give it 11/10
just accept it that BrBa is million times better than GOT ,GOT S08 was epic failure hence,the greatest tv series ever made
Hail HeisenbergðŸ’— This is one of the best piece of art I have seen in my my life. Every inch of story deserves 9 rating . This show is dam realistic . Last episode is completely deserve more than 10 rating . I really wonder how this hustler paid himself #3 top rated series. 
And Hannibal, which's better than Breaking bad, standing on the right spot One of the best shows I have seen on TV, original plot and excellent writing, is as real as it gets in the fantasy TV world, of course in real life some of this characters would die faster like Jessie because in real life there is no job contracts or ratings do not take matter if a character gets killed but as far as TV is as close to reality as it is going to get. I think is easier to believe shows based on fiction or fantasy like Game of thrones because a person can ignore realities and the range for the imagination is wider and anything goes, however in shows that imitate reality is much harder to write because the writers have limits and like I said before you cannot kill a character because that particular character could affect the rating of the show. In reality Walter White seems very real, the only thing that I find to believe is that someone as smart as him would put his life and family in danger for a low life junkie like Jessie in a real situation in the drug world we would have not lasted very long no matter how cool he is. No matter the variety of interesting characters makes it awesome. I just love Breaking bad, please do not tell me episode 5 is the end of it can we get more please, i hope the is a plan ahead?<br/><br/>I have been waiting long now to be told the is season 6 coming up, is the anyone who is doing something about it or that is the end of it all? i just cant wait to hear the good news.<br/><br/>the story line is on point and it is indeed interesting and i would not mind to extra 10 episodes BB and it is indeed so different, the creativity is on point and you can compartmentalize between Breaking Bad and the random series I have ever watched.<br/><br/>I hope this massage get to the right people and if the is something on queue i cant wait. Breaking Bad is so far one of my top ten, top five even, favorite shows ever. The story is so deep, but in the end of all of it you realize: this is what some people are really doing right now with their life. Whether we realize it or not, as entertaining and fascinating Breaking Bad can be, we live in a world that truly contains the struggles, addictions, and lifestyles shown on such an amazing show.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad should forever be considered a grand and original show, with such a moving, powerful, and exciting storyline. This show isn't just about meth, death, and sex (trust me I've heard enough people who haven't watched the show say so). For anybody browsing IMDb right now here in Breaking Bad reviews, I hope anybody reading mine right now knows how much they need, NEED, to begin this series. Now go log on to your Netflix, you're gonna binge watch this for sure. The greatest! That is the word to describe this TV series. I can't imagine, now, the filmography without this golden movie. 5 season, 5 stars, 5 time the best! I really want Gilligan to continue the story. Great thanks to the producer! "Keep calm And Watch Breaking Bad" Yooooooooo !!! Please give me some alternative of TV series, at least as good as Breaking Bad. I try The Wire but is not so deeply attractive. Recently i saw Dexter. Great! Very good, very psyho! Oh! I almost forgot! Please include Jesse Ã®n Better call Saul. He is the salt from the food! I hope you will think about it and give us a good chance to saw again that funny guy. This show is absolutely amazing. Everything about it: the acting, the characters, the writing, the plot...it's all there! This show doesn't fall short at any moment and keeps the audience always wondering. I love it! It is not action packed in the explosive and life and death type way 24/7. No, this show takes time to develop everything. Everything has a reason, and they actually make sense. It is still action packed, but in a different way.<br/><br/>The acting is on point in almost every scene. They bring the characters to life, and they portray the characters how the writers probably want them to be portrayed. I loved every character, even if I disapproved of their actions. Moreover, I sympathized with them, got mad at them, was screaming (inside my head) at them.<br/><br/>This show is an art. I don't know if I could express how much of a treasure it is. I read somewhere that someone said something along the lines of : "I am envious of the people who haven't watched this show because they have the opportunity to watch this brand new." That statement is gold. Could not be more true. This show is life, and definitely my favorite show. It says something about a TV show when even the episodes could be called, 'filler' are entertaining and do something great. Breaking Bad is a show where no episode, scene or moment is wasted. Everything about it is brilliant, the writing is masterful, handling characters and plots with ease with each season building on the next. Delivering both funny, profound, shocking and heartbreaking moments. The directing is superb especially considering they film each episode in only eight days. It always tries to do different things while always serving the story. Visually it is wondrous to behold. The acting is top notch, Bryan Cranston delivers Walter Whites slow decline into villainy wonderfully and Aaron Paul will only be remembered for his role as Pinkman.<br/><br/>This show delivers, when people say it's great, they mean it. It is one of the best shows I have ever seen. Late into season 4 I got a chance to be cast as an extra. I had to admit that I was really excited but really had never seen a whole episode. Before you hate me understand I just hadn't found the time to watch. I got asked to be involved and the first day I could tell how huge this was. I then found a way to watch condensed episodes and watched all the previous seasons marathon style. So now fully prepared for the magnitude of this great show and all that surrounds it. I found myself just as "Geeked out" as my fellow extras because we were fans and could saw things and places that are now famous for our city and people that would become icons of this wonderful adventure. Thank you Vince for trusting in me, and the rest for helping make it a wonderful show. This is my 1st review & I'll keep it short. I don't remember ever watching a series as good as this & the fact that the quality was kept up throughout the whole run was (to me), amazing. I love/d this show & doubt it will be bettered. I'm looking forward to the "Better call Saul" spin-off but i don't expect it to compare. It was a rare show, in the fact that the producers stopped when they did & didn't try to take it past it's best in an attempt to make more cash. The Spin-off looks as though it may be trying to do just that though, only time will tell. Finally, on the off-chance that there is anyone out there that needs any more of a hint that this show wouldn't be a waste of their time &/or cash (re; DVD). I would recommend this to anyone except for young kids, due to the drug theme throughout. "Nothing stops this train!".. you realize early on how accurate those words are, and the intensity only ramps-up as the episodes go by... unavoidably and ultimately heading towards a very dark place (and you start to make an educated guess how it is all going to end). It's a highly acclaimed, award winning show... with production values that are very high, and acting across the board that is outstanding. Bryan Cranston and Anna Gunn are pure gold.. his transformation to an uncontrollable monster, and her attempts at having to deal with all goes with it, is unquestionably remarkable work. There's really only a couple main characters in the entire show that are at all likable, the rest are drug-dealing criminals and low-life's, or damaged personalities. It was most disappointing to see the alluring Krysten Ritter.. bit.ly/15r7d1Z .. depart after so few episodes.. most fans would have truly liked to see her continue for another season or two. It was a loss for the show, having such a dynamic female character excised so quickly. Once she left, the only reason to stick with the series is to see how all plays out between Skyler and Walt. What is most at issue is the writing. The story just has numerous obvious and unbelievable elements that cannot be overlooked, although it appears most viewers are unabashedly willing to do so. It's not enough of a reason not to watch (although the recurring violence could really be a deal breaker for many). A solid 5-stars, not to say, it could have been better with just some minor script alterations. After watching Breaking Bad , it seems that I've made some legendary childhood memories. This series made me cry,gasp and I could hear my heart drumming most of the times. Aaron Paul did an awesome work. Jessie was/is my favorite Breaking Bad character. The part which I loved in the entire series is that WALTER WHITE NEITHER DIES OF CANCER NOR GETS KILLED BY MAFIAS. He was the sole reason behind his death. And that part where he says to Skyler ,I DID IT FOR MYSELF. IT MADE ME FEEL ALIVE. That part was just legendary. I just cant believe that its over. Gilligan, please surprise us. I still cant believe that he is dead. Jessie on the other part was the only one who got out alive. But man,he deserved much better. He was just a kid after-all. Walter White ( Bryan Cranston ) Totally amazing work! I could feel that change. From S1 to S5 , a complete transformation. This show is plain out memorable and one of the shows that should not be missed. It revolves around greed, revenge and redemption. These elements has been portrayed in other shows before. But not as articulately, intricately and meticulously done as this show (or at least I have seen so far). This show boosted Bryan Cranston career and popularity for good reason. Walter White aka Heisenberg has become one of the most iconic television characters. Some show has a first season that is good and starts to go downhill from there. This is a show that has a good first season and it keeps getting better and better until the grand finale, with a exquisitely stand out ending. It's like Vince Gilligan the creator of the show planned just about the main jist of the story when it comes to the 5 season all out from the beginning. With it's high adrenaline build up that build and builds while staying consistent and relevant through out the whole thing. With the chemistry between characters and transformation, thus the title "Breaking Bad". This is a show I would recommend people to stick through few episodes and there is a high chance that it will hook them. This show is a downright great mix of serious drama and comedy. Overall without giving anything much away, this is a well written show with great character developments that is worth checking out.<br/><br/>9.3/10 Well the whole thing was very spectacular, the minute details were taken care of. The ending and everything is realistic of what should have happened in real life consequences. The Story revolves around The Crystal Meth and about how a Nobel Prize Winner wasn't given much appreciation later in his life, probably it was his choices. It has always been his choices about everything he did and he really liked it, we can see him singing while enjoying his glorious crimes and concentrating on something which is illegal, his love for his ninety-nine percent blue baby is fascinating, it comes down to crime and Murders and how the things that mattered the most in life were turned up against him, the sudden realization of losing all that he cared for was tempting and making him clear that it was his love for chemistry that didn't changed and so the two years he lived in his tactical Benevolence was way better than his fifty years of Mundane surviving. "Breaking Bad" It starts with Walter White who knew that Crystal Meth is famous in Albuquerque. He got cancer and he starts making meth with Jesse Pinkman so that when he died he got enough money so his family can survive. It's first season is interesting. My favorite part was when Walter goes to Tuco because Tuco has taken his meth and beat Jesse. I enjoyed the first season. Second and Third season of Breaking Bad is too slow. I get bored watching these episodes. After Hank, Walter's brother-in-law shot Tuco, it get pretty much depressing. Meanwhile, Walter start business with Gustavo Fring who's having very vast meth business. It's get interesting in very end of third season. Fourth and Last Season of Breaking Bad is very interesting. How Walter White take out revenge on Gustavo Fring? How Gustavo killed his old enemy? After killing Gustavo, Walter become king of meth empire. When Hank knows about Walter White in second half of last season, he tries to take down Walter with Jesse Pinkman. Unfortunately Hank was killed by gang who before works for Walter White. They take all of the Walter's money(about 80 million$) and take Jesse as a prisoner. They tortured Jesse and forces him to make meth for them. Here, everyone knows about Walter and his business. Walter decides to came back when Elliot and Gretchen said about Walter White on TV. Walter asks them to gave money to his son on his 18th birthday. In the end, he killed everyone who was with him in meth business, except Jesse and Saul Goodman. He asks Jesse to ran away as he himself get shot. A little disappointment for me is Jesse should also be killed. Some of the dialogs of Breaking Bad are becomes famous like, "I am not in danger, I am the danger", " I am the on who knocks", " Let's say I know a man, who knows a man, who knows another man who can get through your work". It was a brilliant show. I liked it. When i started watching this show i didn't get hooked at once, like i had been by sherlock or by supernatural.. Instead, i hated it. In my opinion the first season was a stretch, long and slow . But little did i know, the story was just getting started.<br/><br/>And from season 2 , to mind-blowing seasons 4 and 5 , this show held the strings of my heart and had me waiting every week with a tub of popcorn and some cola. Even the waiting between two episodes seemed beautiful, it was the time to recall the moments of the last episode and picture the joy in our mind. The series might pick it's pieces up slowly but when it does, your mind will be blown. The story revolves around a chemistry teacher(walter white) in high school who is diagnosed with cancer. And to protect his family's life after him, he starts making meth with his old student(Jesse-Yo) who now deals in drugs. <br/><br/>I know the idea might not appeal to all but when you see it, you'll have a change of opinions. And in my opinion, Watch it! This show is the worst. Boring, stagnant cinematography. Horribly predictable, mundane writing. Worst casting ever assembled. Unbelievably irrelevant, soulless soundtrack. By-the-book editing. Boring subject matter. <br/><br/>I feel as though at times, RL STINE was capable of producing more suspenseful material. This series is the television equivalent of some of the early works of Chad Kroeger, and his friends at Nickelback. <br/><br/>But none of that's true. <br/><br/>You've never been told a tighter story, and you'll never see a better show. Watch it. Watch it again. I don't care what season you got to, finish it. And sorry if you genuinely enjoy the likes of Nickelback. I'm really, very sorry for you.<br/><br/>10/10. "Breaking bad" is the meaning for someone who is following an otherwise normal and moral lifestyle decides to "break bad" and enter into an immoral or an illegal lifestyle. Perfectly sums up this series, Walter White, an Overqualified Chemistry teacher gets diagnosed with stage III cancer and decides to adopt a life of crime and deception as a maker of meth amphetamine with "Jessie Pinkman" or "Captain Cook" a high-school drop-out and was taught Chemistry by Walter. As they pair up and develop the best recipe in the business. When Walt gets diagnosed he has the hard choice of how his family will cope financially. <br/><br/>As he makes his way up the meth making ladder until he starts to attract attention from other drug gangs, the Mexican cartel and Evan the DEA (Drug enforcement agency) in which Walts brother in law works for. Walt and Jessie begin to go through many distributors like Tuco Salamanca and Gustavo Fring. <br/><br/>This show is a very good with good portrayal of characters from the main characters like Walt and Jessie to the smaller characters like Saul and Mike they all are very good. They wrap all of the series up at the end mostly although they usually add a cliff-hanger. In any circumstance I would give this show 10/10 purely because of its plot and unravelling. It is no wonder that it is the number 1 show in America because of its mix of humour and seriousness of a serious subject. Breaking bad is in my opinion the greatest TV show of all time, and I think it would be hard to deny it is one of the most neglected TV show in terms of TV ratings. The writing is unbelievable, the acting amazing with superb character development down to the minor players. My favorite character is Saul Goodman who isn't even in half the episodes, he's hilarious, almost everything thing he says cracks me up. It kills me that the show is not more well known than it is, I put it up there with the sopranos and the wire. It deserves so much credit as well because it is so original, the subject, characters, and story line. I just had to put pen to paper on this one, my man Bryan Cranston has done too good of job. Thank you so much for all your work! I've been a huge fan of Breaking Bad since I first started seeing the ads for season 1. I've told everyone I know about how great this show is. I've gotten my wife and all of her friends hooked on it, and we religiously watch every episode.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad hooks the viewer immediately with it's lets get down to business approach. This show is a unique, candid portrayal of shocking realism. Each individual character in Breaking Bad is unforgettable, and as real as can be. No fluff. The unstable balance between Walt's criminal endeavors and his middle-class teacher profile is brilliant. The excitement over all of the characters coming within a millimeter of exposing Walt and the threat of the ball of yarn coming unraveled at any time is thrillingly unnerving.<br/><br/>I can't wait to see what season 4 brings, and how all of the pieces of the puzzle will come together. Breaking Bad has all the elements of a timeless drama. Well thought out, and well executed.<br/><br/>Buying the DVDs! I am a new member here. My summary says it all. Every facet of this series is top-notch. I know that meth is evil. Yet I'm rooting for Walt and Jessie to get away with it all and come out on top. Unlikely. I pray there is at least 5 worthwhile seasons. This is must-watch TV. But some may want to suspend some of their moral predispositions - at least for an hour/week. I have seen every episode twice. And some three times. Every viewing I have enjoyed more then the last. This entire cast is, well, magic. The highlight of the show for me is the intense interaction between Walt and Sky. There have been scenes over the three seasons that have been as riveting as anything in my favorite films. Breaking Bad, like (for me Six Feet Under) is a showcase of what television can be. Unlike Six Feet Under it has yet to slide, even briefly, into mediocrity. Breaking Bad, on the surface, seems to be a marketable and typical show following the usual premise of a middle class American leading a double life- one for good, and one for evil- in the wake of other great shows like the Sopranos, Dexter, Weeds, etc.<br/><br/>However, what starts off as an enjoyable drama evolves into a beautifully crafted tale- the stuff of a complex modern Shakespearian tragedy. Breaking Bad is more than just a television show. It is a work of art. The acting is mostly impeccable, and the writing and dialogue is original and profound. On top of it all, the directing style seems to have evolved and improved throughout the series. Nearly every shot is a masterpiece of its own.<br/><br/>So if you are looking for an original series, which will not only kill a couple of hours, but also leave you seeing the world in a different way- finding story in every small instance around you- this is the show for you **minor spoilers**<br/><br/>Breaking Bad is simply put one of the very best TV series in the history of television. The plot sounds very simple and in some ways generic at first glance. A law abiding chemistry teacher is diagnosed with cancer and decides to use the time he has left to leave behind some money for his family by producing crystal meth.<br/><br/>This series runs with that idea and never slows down. Everything here is top notch. The Acting on this show has won multiple Emmys (Lead and Supporting in a Drama Series), the writing keeps everything fresh and fluid, the cinematography is movie caliber, the direction and editing are also spot on.<br/><br/>However, accolades and awards are what this show wins but not what is it about. This show is about telling a story that is in every way fully developed and deliberate with its steady pace.<br/><br/>Walter White is a man who as the series starts; appears to be your typical nerdy science teacher. When pushed to desperation we see him take the road less traveled by and step outside society's rules. We see him go into a dangerous world and go deeper still after seeing its harsh reality. We see this is a man who has some demons of his own. Who, for reasons revealed as the story unfolds, feels like he is not where he should be in life. He played by the rules and feels cheated and now he plans to get what is owed him.<br/><br/>He teams up with Jesse Pinkman. A small time dealer and user who at first teachers Walter the ropes. We see their ambitions rise ever higher and their relationship become wonderfully complex and intricate.<br/><br/>Skylar is Walter's wife who we see go on a roller coaster of emotions as events unfold. From loving wife who is scared for her husband to suspicious wife who starts to notice something is not quite right and more.<br/><br/>Hank is Walter's DEA brother in law who comes off as buffoonish and simple at first but soon we see his many layers underneath the initial glance.<br/><br/>Many other great characters as added as the story goes on and all of them get their time to shine as we get to know them.<br/><br/>What they all have in common is all of them are affected by the choices Walter makes and we see again and again how things slowly get a little worse because of them. This is a story of going into a toxic world and having it contaminate you and the people around you. About how good intentions can lead to bad results. About how a bad environment can bring out those latent emotions of rage, greed and ruthlessness. Most of all though, perhaps it is about asking a simple question.<br/><br/>How long can you stay in that world before it starts to become a part of you? And how long before there is no way out? <br/><br/>Walter White made his decision and started breaking bad; but is there still a chance he will change his mind and start breaking good? <br/><br/>This emotional, tense, funny and often unpredictable ride will keep you glued to your seat waiting for that answer. After the consistent awards this series has gotten, I caved in and decided to catch up on the craze, and I am everything but disappointed.<br/><br/>The story is about a high school chemistry teacher's introduction into the darker side of life, drugs. His wife is pregnant, his friends are successful, his son has cerebral palsy, and a couple other significant factors that cause his break-down from everything he once knew.<br/><br/>Bryan Cranston (Malcolm in the Middle), Aaron Paul, and RJ Mitte are my three favorite actors in this series. Bryan Cranston has won numerous awards for his portrayal of Walter White. Aaron Paul is one of the first actors I've seen that pulls off the "thug" style without being over-the-top or embarrassing. RJ Mitte portrays a kid with cerebral palsy extremely well, I hope he gets enough recognition. Anna Gunn and Dean Norris are both extremely talented in the series as well.<br/><br/>The series seems as if it has a limited storyline, but every episode leads to more potential, and it is bound to be a classic. The opening to the episodes are sometimes set in the future, which is creative and refreshing from the normal openings.<br/><br/>I cannot praise this series enough, let's just hope it continues to be successful. It's worth the time and money, perfectly perfect. I saw this on the wall at the video store so many times. I even picked it up a few times, but always moved on to something else. I finally one day brought the first season home for my wife and I to watch. We were hooked! This is our favorite show now. The word needs to get out about this show because it is the best show on TV right now and no one has heard of it. If you haven't watched this show, do yourself a favor. There are some slow moments in the first season, but it all pays off. It seems like such a strange premise, man cooking meth with some flunkie kid he use to teach in high school, but somehow they pull it off. The complexity of the story is compelling and the acting is spectacular. Its starting to seem like there are better shows on the cable channels than network TV now. This show is up there with Rescue Me for any you FX fans out there. personally this TV series made laugh at several scenes & on several occasion i find myself keep watching the next episodes. But frankly i would recommend to focus on the new generation & give them a message that they need to build qualities that demands sacrifices & persistence in life in order to overcome situations that occurs during their life journey. in this TV show, the ultimate escape was to produce highest quality crystal meth. everyone wants to become a chemistry guru & make easy money now :) If it was me to edit the story, i would have added more negative results so people (the young ones) could learn & avoid it (making $1.2 Million) was an easy job. in these days young people should always build & develop qualities that demands aspiration, patience, persistence, etc.. Matters are qualities no college in the world could teach. Title says it all, not my type. Just thought I should put this out there This is the most overrated show of all time
Complete torture Makes you wanna forget everything you just saw as soon as you finish this genius masterpiece of a show.
Btw there are several Easter eggs you may find when watching this perfect show over and over again. Episodes are stretched and felt sometimes irritating which pissed me off.
Season 1 start is amazing and mind blowing but the way it goes it became boring.
Jesse role is mostly college brat than drug dealer. He dont fit in that role.
Walt role cool in first season but later it feels monotonous.
I was bored and I am not the only one. when I asked my few friends and they had same opinion. The Best Show ever Created<br/><br/>You will watch it more than once<br/><br/>(Watched it 8 times) I love Breaking Bad but honestly it is a bit over hyped. For my liking it's one of my favorite shows ever but I would have never expected it to have such an amazing rating. 8.5 IMDb rating sure but 9.4 is surprising. There are way too many filler episodes that build up for some epic craziness in the episodes following so you have to get through them. Also, I would have thought the acting, which I think is amazing, would hurt the shows rating. The actors play the characters so realistically that it might be mistaken for bad acting, especially Bryant Cranston playing Walter White. In real life, people in tough situations people tend to struggle with decision making. I believe that people who don't like this show, which I thought would be a greater number, don't understand that we are watching the characters from 3rd perspective. For us observing the events, it seems so obvious to how the characters should react, but put yourself in one of the characters shoes, lets say Walter's wife Skylar, and you would react SO SO similarly to how she did/does. The story line progresses so much throughout the seasons that it's hard to believe where it started. The build up to the main episodes is so great that it gets pretty predictable to what is the big thing that is suppose to happen but these main events are so crazy that even when we know what's going to happen, they are still surprising. If that even makes sense. You have to watch the show to understand what I am talking about. I highly recommend Breaking Bad. Try taking into consideration what I mentioned above when watching and you will be one of those people that understands the show and wont be skeptical of it. You know Hype? Yea It can be a beach. I've been following IMDb for a while now and I can honestly say that there's a certain demographic that votes for TV shows and movies on this site. In this new millennium there have been new shows with great ideas like Game of thrones,Dexter and of course Breaking Bad taking over modern television, but unfortunately all of these shows are overrated. I don't want to bash breaking bad-The show definitely has some good qualities and ideas going for it, but I just cant feel underwhelmed by most parts on this show. The writing and duologue are just average and the characters personal lives are about as interesting as my next door neighbors(which I can actually care about).<br/><br/>Compared to the witty and thought provoking duologue of dramas like six feet under, Oz, Sopranos, Shameless,Walking Dead and The Good Wife-Breaking Bad can just not add up. Don't get me wrong I wont doubt Vince Gilligan as a decent script writer,but this show has too many pot holes for it to be called the best thing on television. To elaborate the show has a lot of dead time that just leaves it to meander. The characters are unconvincing and the duologue cannot support them and just falls by the waste side.There are people that I respect that love thisshow, but I just cant help but feel a personal tragedy that I cant get into Breaking bad.<br/><br/>I remember seeing the score on IMDb, metacrtic and hearing about all of the accolades the show has gotten. So I decided to watch the show from the beginning to catch up with the loyal fans. I really didn't like season 1 and 2 and found the rest was thoroughly enjoyable, but earlier today during the amc marathon I wanted to show my mom,sister and grandma breaking bad. Sadly they weren't into it and unfortunately neither was I. For some reason the spark was gone that was once there from season 3-5. All the episodes seem boring and pointless. It almost seem like I was watching a boring Tarantino movie with no plot or duologue(And we all know that's what makes his movies special.<br/><br/>In the Top 20 alone there are shows with violence,drugs and sex.Breaking Bad has all of the above and im not saying that's a bad thing, but it seems like breaking bad is relying on its shock value to keep people intrigued. Breaking Bad is a show that clearly has a lot of hype and a cult fanbase backing it, but the acclaim for this show is baffling to me..People act like its the best thing since sliced bread .There are better TV shows out there than this(An average 99 average score on metacrtic and loads of nominations/Awards!! are you fuggin serious??) This show is average at best, but hey that's my opinion. Dexter,Mad Men and Breaking Bad they all have one thing i common: Their all overrated and rely on style instead of actual substance, but they do have their moments which deserves some consideration of checking them out.<br/><br/>It's freaking great to see the idea of a show like breaking bad taking off on regular cable television and I'm worried that the hype has affected my opinion for the worse, but I felt it was kind of necessary to make a review for people looking for a little more elaboration,and possibly a dissenting opinion. Thank you for your time. This is just my opinion. I really don't like the first season that is not the best game even if you have played it A decent show but based on the reviews I expected way more. Pretty predictable, never really left you on the edge of your seat. Has some good characters with interesting arcs at least! Mr. white is an a bad actor and some time give us a over reacting and some stupid thing with his brother in law First season was good then it went down hill fast. I feel like they fired a writer or two. First season was so much drama and omg then season 2 Walt goes insta dumb and desires to make dumb mistakes left and right. Breaking bad is a good show but fails to achieve greatness on multiple levels due to a combination of bad acting, unrealistic writing and lack of grit.<br/><br/>Brysan Cranston plays Walter White who is terminally ill high school chemistry teacher who decides to leave his family with a substantial sum of money to support them in the future by cooking meth. There is no denying that Cranston is fine actor but the supporting cast and where the show gets let down the most. <br/><br/>The supporting characters do not come across as believable either with their dialogue or actions and sadly their acting is less than desirable. Like so many before it the show strives to show "true" grit but fails like so many American shows, I don't know whether it is the lighting or make up but everything is too shiny and clean and this is a common problem with American shows compared to British shows, which do often capture the rough and crude far better.<br/><br/>Breaking bad is good show but nothing special but worth a watch is nothing else is on. Since the show came out I've watched the first season a total of four times. I know so many people that love the show, so I've tried my hardest to get into it. The acting is great and the original storyline is great, I just don't think the show deserves the accolades that it has earned. By the first 3 episodes you've basically gathered the entire gist of the show, and not much changes from start to finish. I've forced myself to watch this show multiple times and I just can't get a feel for it. Love the actors, love the storyline, but the growth of the show and its ability to grab my attention leaves me wondering why this show has the ratings it does. If you're looking for a decent show to consume your time, I recommend it. Past that, the show doesn't really stand out to me. Its extremely overrated and not comparable to other tv series like got its also very boring and cant make u to watch many episodes in a row.7 is the score i give So, the Breaking Bad was a trend. And I watched it. I was sure blinded by the high IMDb score. But when I saw, that separate episodes got bad reviews (average around 7), was even more frustrated, that I spent several hours behind TV and watched this crap.<br/><br/>Why crap? I can't enjoy the show, if the main character isn't a positive one. It could kill, and be in the wrong side of the law. But still, he should have some positive principles.. But not in this show. Main character is lying, he doesn't care about his family, total egoist. And other fella, his partner. Spoiled idiot. That's why I hated this series. Story could be very interesting, but the actors spoiled it. For the most part I am eager to praise great acting for all five seasons, but when it comes to the story line I feel they should have either ended with the 3rd season, or approached it with more thought over sensationalism and shock tactics.<br/><br/>What is it with TV show producers that makes them continuously choose to milk their concept to the point when there is no choice but to end the series?! I binged watched the series, literally fast forwarding the last couple of seasons (considering I watched it during the cover-19 quarantine, you understand how desperate it got that I couldn't wait to get it over with!<br/><br/>The main character started out as a sensitive, gentle and troubled individual, that at some point just bridged into a psychopath, without warning or proper evolution. This makes me think that the focus groups forced writers to concentrate more on the antics, special effects and hysteria than the evolution of this fascinating character. Which is difficult to accept since the pace of the characters is so thoughtful for the first three seasons.<br/><br/>I accept that the character needed to disintegrate towards the end, morally and physically. What i don't accept is that someone rather tortured and sensitive, suddenly became callus and calculating. All these years he was accumulating pain and failures that all came to a critical point with his diagnosis. Half the show he is creating a safety net for his family, and the other half building his legacy. One does not necessarily cancel out the other, but we don't see that evolution...we are just made to accept it and move on with the show.<br/><br/>I have noticed that many shows overstay their welcome by the end of third season. You are literally watching not out of interest in the character, but wanting to get it over with and move on! I think this is a missed opportunity to leave a viewer without some reflection, and regret that we have to say our final goodbyes to the characters. Instead I was relieved it was over and done with! This is me sitting at the start of episode 3 of season 5. What do I do? Do I drop the show, it still hasn't captured me... but how is this possible, everyone I know around me says it's THE best TV show EVER made.. What do I do at this point. I am really trying to find reasons beyond just ''having seen it'' so my friends stop bugging me and I can disappoint them by saying I thought it was ''okay''.<br/><br/>So as of writing this I'm not yet finished with the show but I'm so clogged up I have to write it out for my future self and perhaps after seeing the explosive final episodes which will surely be really engaging and good yeah. But that doesn't make up for 3 seasons of lackluster TV. The 3 seasons I'm talking about are 1-3.<br/><br/>So how do I start to compare this to show like The Sopranos or The Wire or Mad Men.. They are not even in the same ballpark.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad is a ride, with a long and slow chainlift, and then at the end you get your 50 seconds of action in the final 2 seasons. Was the slow climb worth it, no way.<br/><br/>Let's start with the directing. First being that this show is on AMC, so bad words are a no go. This directly hurt the realism of the show which it is so desperately trying to portray. Jesse saying ''screw you'' in a moment of intense rage.. come one. But okay, that's just how it is I guess. Fine. But then, the display of violence or shootouts are mostly just a mess of jump cuts or shown off screen for no apparent reason. I mean why does a show that wants to show the bleak side of a character's choices not show the actual reality of them? The only case that we had this that I can remember was when Gustavo killed one of his goons. Which was also incredibly drawn out for ''suspenseful'' reasons but it ended up being incredibly underwhelming. Third, what can I say, orange filter mexico. The directing isn't anything special it's bog standard no attempt at even the slightest of symbolism or something more trying.<br/><br/>Then the acting, man, people must really love the strong and silent type on this show, makes writing pretty easy huh. First the twins that just stare and walk like some gangster duo out of bad film. Then Gustavo who again just likes to stare. I mean what do we really know about Gustavo, why should we see him any other way than just a big bad drug boss, that's all he is, and his death scene, was incredibly cheesy. He comes walking out a room, were a massive explosion happened and with half his face blown off, no blood or barely mind you, he straightens his TIE!? Congrats, you just confirmed to the viewer he was just a character, nothing more, no depth. But oh wait, what about that car bomb he managed to use his spidey sense to sniff out. That scene in particular made me question what made people praise this show to the extremes we are at now. Am I missing something?! Is it not incredibly cheesy? Doesn't this completely destroy any sense of realism or immersion? He had zero reason to know there was a bomb there. Now I am not saying he should've died there either, but honestly after how he actually died, he probably would've walked it off. Also now that I remember that explosive scanner one of his mercenaries uses to scan the room, went right by the wheelchair, and didn't even signal anything. Like how even?! Weak writing. If it nearly misses the bomb, then somehow SHOW the viewer.<br/><br/>I went a bit offtopic and into writing but back to the acting. The acting is great from Walter, Jesse and pretty much everyone really, they all perform well, even if the dialog is quite plain. And for that plain dialog the show adds staring as one of its key plots. Man, like I said these writers love the strong silent type and its everywhere in this show. Silence is meant to convey thought, and yeah the show does this, but it seems like people are just constantly not in the mood to open their mouth. But that's the dialog writing, it's simply weak. And honestly one of the mean reasons the show didn't hook me. You might've noticed I mentioned a couple shows at the start of this review, what are one of the strongest points in those shows, DIALOG. It's absolutely amazing, drags you into the world. Grounds you. BB failed at that.<br/><br/>No for character development, i'm not gonna comment too much on it because I need to finish the show still and need to see how their arcs end, albeit slightly predictable. But so far character development has been really slow, and my main issue is with Walter who seems to jump back and forth between pushover and sociopath especially in earlier seasons. Some moments just felt very uncharacteristic. Take Walt blowing up some arrogant man's car at a gas pump for instance in S1. Just because the guy is judgmental doesn't mean you go crazy and endanger lives. Thankfully they clean up his actions a little more later on in the show but its just really stupid.<br/><br/>
Okay so Walter junior, I don't know if he's gonna be part of the final season in an instrumental way but 'm having a hard time finding the actual point of this character. Yes, in a way he is what kept the family together I guess because he didn't want them to divorce (even though that ended up never going through because Skyler never filed it). But beyond that he feels very wasted. And he has a ton of screen time but most of it is for nothing.<br/><br/>Another thing I miss in this show, COMEDY, only one I could think off that could provide some comedy is Brandon and Hank. But even at that it's mostly pretty forced and I barely laughed during my time viewing. Which is a real bummer because comedy is an essential ingredient to a show. The Sopranos is one of the best examples for that.<br/><br/>Oh wow.. I wrote a lot. I guess I did it because I know that I just have to put down on paper what I feel right now after having seen 4 seasons of what people call the best tv show ever made. I mean.. I'm disappointed really. And sure, expectations were high but so were they for The Wire and The Sopranos and many other shows. But *most* of them didn't fail at delivering them, this one did.. and it feels terrible, also knowing that people IRL love the show and have been urging me to watch it. And now I gotta come back and say it was just ''okay''. Yeah that's not fun.<br/><br/>FINALE UPDATE: Finished the show and I can definitely say it's at its strongest in S5 with S4 being a decent build up. My points still stand pretty much. It got a very traditional TV land ending and I guess that's okay. That said, the little teasers at the cold opens for when walt went AWOL ruined a lot of the ''what is he gonna do'' mystery. So I wish they didn't do that, also they kind of messed up with that because they showed some key clues, but then just recapped them in the finale so the those teaser kind of lack any value now.<br/><br/>In addition, If there is one annoying thing about the final season is that they extort the cliffhanger trope, its cliff after cliff. I find it cheesy these days because a good show shouldn't have to rely on cheap tragedies to keep viewers coming back, the actual content should suffice.<br/><br/>Also... another thing is the shootout with Hank, which was also the biggest offender of the cliffhanger, but they got Steve dying off screen in between cliffhangers.. disappointing as well as the whole shootout, None of them would've ever been able to walk away and get in cover as slow as they did. They had like 10 automatic guns and shotguns pointed at them.<br/><br/>7.5-8/10 is my final verdict, it did have a good enough finale / final episodes, but nothing too unpredictable really.<br/><br/>Solid entertaining show but definitely NOT a GOAT. This TV series is brilliant but. There is to much useless, sitting home, not working (and they have money trouble) wife. Annoying, ugly character absolutely useless in this story This show has repeatedly been labeled "Best television series of all time" Sometimes I think these are the people that once they read something a certain amount of times they believe it.<br/><br/>I have to call BS.<br/><br/>Average writing.<br/><br/>Average dialogue.<br/><br/>Suspense gets good as it goes along as S4/S5 bring out the Emmy worthy material.<br/><br/>After the demise of the Token black character who happens to run a huge drug empire and sell chicken as a front for said empire the show brings on a bland new antagonist that you wish would just go away but sadly they stay the duration of S5. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul is made legend series I can certainly recommend.<br/><br/>When I reviewed the first series, I asked: What is Walt up to? Is this some desperate, incoherent scream of rage in the face of the approaching blackness? In the end, we do learn the rather simpler answer because, well, Walt tells us. And it really does make sense of everything. Almost. Breaking Bad is great. But it's not perfect. Cranston's performance alone is enough to keep me watching for a while, but I'd like to see something resembling a completed formula, and soon.<br/><br/>This show is just amazing,I loved every episode,This is one of my favorite shows...... <br/><br/>But....It's not for everyone ,This show is not safe for people under the age of 15.... <br/><br/>But it is enjoyable for pretty much everyone else :D The story and acting are incredible. I think we need a new word for what Aaron Paul does. It's so real it can't be "acting"! He has to be the best actor of our time. And Bryan Cranston and others: on the same level. Incredible. So sorry it's over. Still hoping they'll bring it back somehow as now I have nothing to watch (that compares). The way the story is mixed with action, you become part of it and it is so real at times that it can be hard to watch! An emotional roller coaster! To see the change in Walter White over time is insane. For me, I started out sympathizing a little but by the end of the series, I was ready for him to die (like most people in his life I think, including him). What a change and brilliant the way it was handled! I love this show. No show will ever be better or as good as this show. I love the characters,the actors and the storyline. The best characters are Walt,Jesse,Saul,Hank,Badger and Walt jr. The best episode of the show is the one where Gus dies. That was amazing just watching him walk out of Hectors room after the explosion with half his face blown off. Season 4 was the best. It was amazing watching there feud with Gus fring and trying to kill him.I love the episode where Hank is shot by Tucos cousin. There were times when the show got sad like when Walt and Skyler divorce and when Hank dies. The last episode was amazing. The gun on the car was so cool. It was very sad watching Walt die. I miss watching this show. I've only watched two episodes of Better call Saul and I'm enjoying it but it's obviously not as good as Breaking Bad and like I said no show will ever be better or as good as this show. There are plenty of shows close to it but not as good.The saddest deaths on the show were Hank,Mike and obviously Walt. This is an amazing show and i'm glad I watched it. Firstly I want to thanks AMC for bringing such a amazing experience to us "Breaking Bad". let me tell about pros and cons in point for better view :) <br/><br/>Pros---> 1) Acting is never like this on TV before. 2) You will love the bad guy more than good guy. 3) All characters get space and no one will say that its one sided hero act. 4) "Hizenberg" or W.W (Bryan Cranston), I don't know but surely you are the best best actor when comes to acting. How on earth you change so much from season 1 to season 5. 5) Director "Vince Gilligan", only one sentence for you. You know exactly what to show and when to show. 6) Hank and Pinkman are like best person I ever seen, I cried when Hank was killed. 7) "Meth" is a unknown word for me before seeing Breaking Bad :) 8) And the best part , for no doubt that surely in bad way, there is pleasure and money. But the lose in the way is extreme and is shown in best way possible. I don't think anyone else in the world can do different than what Mr. White did. Even though Bad is Bad. Hence paid the price.. Bit sad for those good characters who died unnecessarily due to him, which shows bad have nothing good. Money Can't buy happiness ever.<br/><br/>Cons---> 1) Aaah tough to find .. Even though Season 1 was slow, but please somehow don't miss first 4 episodes. Theraafter you will love it. 2) Jisse stop saying "Bitch" word from Season 3, seems like to capture family audience, not good to see him so good :) . 3) This is a family show, so the pickle and soda not find much place, though the script and direction replace that beautifully. 4) I am sad about the ending, Hank didn't get justice, neither Marie or Walter bigger son. I am bit unhappy as it totally shows the bitter truth. May be I am expecting for happy ending which was not possible. 5) Walter White was the character to whom people love in starting and may be hate to some extend in the end, on the other side Pinkmen got vice versa result for the same. It defines how the time changes.<br/><br/>I don't want to really go with what was "Cons" seriously as It is the "Experience" i got for whole life time. <br/><br/>#ThankYouBreakingBad I just watched this recently - not sure how I missed it when it was originally broadcast.<br/><br/>This series will put you on an emotional roller coaster of epic proportions. You'll change your mind over and over again with how you feel about certain characters, but in a good way. By the time it's over you will feel completely satisfied with everything.<br/><br/>The acting was phenomenal, as was the story. Bravo to all those who were involved in making this series.<br/><br/>You will NOT be disappointed.<br/><br/>Looking forward to what happens in the spin off of "Better Call Saul"! If I'm going to write a review on IMDb it has to be about Breaking Bad.My favorite TV Series.If you want a TV Series going to change your life style you have to watch Breaking Bad.What can i say... First season is go very well.Second is quite slow but not boring.And when the Season 3 come it's make you feel what i said on the first place.The other seasons follow the 3.I wish it didn't end.Because i didn't like the end.It has to ended but not like that.I don't know maybe happy ending going to be more cool.But I'm not judging.I only say end might be more happy then that.This is it all my words.I hope you enjoyed my review.This is my first so sorry if i bored you. A rave review of Breaking Bad doesn't do the show justice. My words have been said by many, but I'll say it again, Breaking Bad is the greatest show of all time. It goes to another level. The story is intriguing and, in the sense that many men with little income are diagnosed with the financial and physical burden of cancer, quite relatable. The use of symbolism is evident and is done in such an intelligent way. The show is written with such versatility and excellence. Vince Gilligan is able to write each of his characters in the own way; he uses wit and humor, while also effectively writing dark, dramatic scenes and lines. The acting is - for the most part - unbelievable, which is mostly a testament to the show's star, Bryan Cranston. He captivates audiences with his dilemma that they sympathize with, and he presents a dramatic, and sometimes laughable character, which he brings to life. Supporting roles filled by the likes of Anna Gunn, Aaron Paul, Dean Norris, Giancarlo Esposito, Bob Odenkirk, and Jonathan Banks are performed brilliantly. The show is directed in such an interesting and unique way. <br/><br/>What really goes a long way with Breaking Bad is its standalone nature. You'll never watch a show similar (except its spin-off, Better Call Saul, which is also phenomenal). WATCH THIS SHOW AND WATCH IT NOW. My first review on IMDb (I think). I want to congratulate the entire cast, crew, writers, producers, etc.. on this monumental achievement. Binge-watched the entire series in 2 weeks. Remarkable casting. Superb writing. Even the film stock has subtle qualities not seen in regular TV shoots (I understand BB was filmed in 35mm film). Rarely predictable, layered and nuanced in ways TV rarely is, and emotionally gripping. It's had me thinking about it for days afterward, like a really excellent novel. I didn't realize Walt was the zany dad on Malcom in the Middle until the 3rd season. Never knew he could really ACT in a deeply dramatic role.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and watch this artistic masterpiece of dramatic theater. Do yourself a favor and watch arguably one of the best, highest rated, most award nominated/award winning shows ever. I probably don't need to tell you about the plot, because most people know what it is, but in case you don't know, Walter White, a high school Chemistry teacher, and Jessie, his old high school student, meet up and work together with Walters knowledge of Chemistry, and Jessies' street knowledge, they build a meth empire. Each season has its own story arch, revolving around a different character or idea, and each season is more intense than the last. This show also has some of the best acting I've ever seen. And all of it is on Netflix. You know what to do. This show is easily the best show I have ever watched. The story is excellent and is executed to near perfection. From a plot standpoint, it does a brilliant job of having an intriguing overarching plot through all the seasons, while having several mini-plots that get resolved as time goes on each season. It's very easy for a show like this to lose grip with reality, but it does a very good job of not falling off the unrealistic cliff. The characters are played exactly as the story would want them to be. Each character develops throughout the show with some of them creating internal conflict within yourself as to whether they're someone to root for or against. It has enough action to keep you on the edge throughout the show. I also appreciate that the network and writers didn't see its success and try to drag the show on and on. Without providing spoilers, I was very happy with the ending, which can't be said for many shows. I have almost completed watching it in its entirety for the second time. Maybe when I was a small child I watched a couple of shows such as Inspector Gadget and Heathcliff in their entirety, but in my adult years I mostly could not have cared less about TV and have watched only a handful of modern shows until this show was released on Netflix. It's the best TV show of all time, and it will probably have that distinction for decades to come, like the Beatles. I actually continue to like movies much more than TV shows, but I cannot even think of a movie that I like nearly as much as this show. The Beatles of movies has yet to be released, I guess. :) This's a serious story which indeed looks so realistic that in many ways it resemble how people really falls into crime! Rise in the story is scripted so well that in end if you would have been asked to resign from your job just to watch the remaining series, you would do that and think of yourself later :)<br/><br/>It's a masterpiece. I highly recommend this as the most watchful series. I'm a serious fan of Bryan Cranston, so I won't say that he has done role of his lifetime :) but he surely did a class act in this epic series for which he would always be remembered for and without him as "Walter White" "Breaking Bad" would have not been THE "Breaking Bad".<br/><br/>Aaron Paul has also done a classic role I enjoyed it but the real deal is Bryan's character "Walter White". Story revolves around him. Once you start watching this series you'll feel for all characters, you'll develop emotions for him and in end when everyone else hates Walt you'll become his greatest supporter!! Loved every minute of this show. The development of the characters, the acting. All just compelling viewing and believable until season 3's "fly" episode. OMG! What were they thinking? The main guys Walt and Jesse acted out of their characters. Especially, usually smart Walt using a clipboard, a shoe and a mop to kill a fly... in a lab? Then the two start hitting each other that I can only liken to watching Curly and Moe of The Three Stooges. Were the original writers on strike or were they on methampethemine when they made this episode? It was a waste of time and should not have been made and included on the series. I still love this show and will pretend this sorry episode did not happen. Breaking Bad is one of the most addictive shows out there. I started watching with a little bit of skepticism but it proved me wrong very quickly. <br/><br/>Throughout the shows duration I have never seen a character transformation like the one Walter White undergoes throughout his various experiences. I'd always pictured Bryan Cranston as a "nerdier" actor however, this series completely changed my view of him.<br/><br/>By far one of the greatest modern shows. It has it all from action, suspense,comedy etc... <br/><br/>Definitely worth a watch! <br/><br/>http://gmretro.ca First of all: Breaking Bad is easily the best show ever made, great story, brilliant actors, 10 out of 10. Only one thing is a bit puzzling.. what is the point about all those allusions to Germany? Many characters (an they are not all nice guys) have names of German origin: Family Schrader, Ted Beneke, Gale Boetticher, Mike Ehrmantraut, Gretchen Schwartz, Dan Wachsberger etc. Walter White calls himself "Heisenberg" (a German physicist). Jessy uses terms like "Adolf" and "Hitler" to show his disrespect to certain people. Hank says things like "we are not in Nazi-Germany" or "there are enough Germans here to invade Poland". Last not least the company "Madrigal" that controls the drugdeals is located in Germany. To much for coincidence, or not. Anyways, the makers seam to have a special affinity to our country:) I was first skeptical about this show to be honest. But im glad I gave it a shot when I had the chance. The show revolves around the main protagonist of the series Walt, who finds out he is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. In efforts to leave his wife and handicapped son with the best future financially, he partners up with a fromal student of his, Jesse to cook and distribute meth and other drugs around the area. The show does not cease to disappoint its audience by leaving viewers with the anticipation to watch more.Walt, usually finds himself in hot water throughout the show keeping the audience attracted. Walt and jesse constantly are plaqued with the troubles and hardships it truly is to be a successful drug dealer, which is what truly keeps the show running. The bigger question is will Walt be successful in his illicit and controversial efforts, or will he end up regreting this decision? The show ties in self morals and provocative questions that can lead many people in the audience questions about themselves. Give this show a try.....u wont be disappointed. Since you are checking out Breaking Bad on IMDb, you already know this show so you are probably hooked on it as well as I am. For those still doubting when to start watching it, make it a top priority! Leave the groceries in the hallway, the goldfish can go on a diet, leave it all and go watch. It really is as good as everybody says it is. All the actors give Oscar-worthy performances, but you can tell the crew is giving their best as well. The interiors of the houses feel very real, whether it is the house of a drug addict or a middle-income family. I want to commend the casting agency for all the right picks, and the writers for developing believable story lines and making all the pieces fit even after five seasons. The actors also deserve a compliment for showing all aspects of their character's grief, including showing them on their most vulnerable and ugly moments. Have you ever experienced a life changing event which has turned your complete world upside down. I can't say I have, but I know someone who has. His name is Walter White: Loving father, true husband, dedicated chemistry teacher, crystal meth master chef. "Wait a second!" you think. Something in that sentence didn't fit in. You're damn right it didn't, and that's what makes Breaking Bad fit in perfectly in the series hall of fame! <br/><br/>50 year old Walter White has a teenage son with cerebral palsy, trying his best to fit in, and a pregnant wife not afraid to speak her mind. When Walter learns that he has lung cancer and probably hasn't got very long to live, he decides that he must do Whatever IT Takes to secure the future of his family. As far as I am concerned, producing crystal meth serves perfectly well as the IT and Walter seems to share my view on that. He's got the brains, he knows the chemistry but lacks the street experience. Better gain some.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad is all about conflicting opposites with an antihero leading the way by erasing the fine line between right and wrong, good and bad. How long can you keep keep a double life double? How much bad is acceptable in the attempts to achieve something good? There are many questions to answer, but there are no clear answers to be found. Once the iron chains of the law have been broken there ain't no easy way to mend them again, unless you want to play the part of the missing link. Walter sure doesn't and is driven further and further down the path he has chosen, transforming into someone no-one had expected. As long as I can be the spectator watching from the other side of the screen I'll cheer it all on with eyes big as steering wheels screaming: "Break that law! Break it bad!"<br/><br/>Oh, did I mention that Walter's brother-in-law works for the drug enforcement administration? When straight-laced high school chemistry teacher Walter White is diagnosed with cancer, he turns to cooking meth hoping to sock away some big money for his family before he dies. But the cancer might not get a chance to kill him after all... his new profession might just do it faster.<br/><br/>From frame one... of episode one... of season one... this series will grab you by the soft and hard parts and not let go. You will be drop-jaw-wowed by the production quality, scripts, acting, and execution of this stand-out series. <br/><br/>True artistry and brilliance is transparent in writing and filmography so that what appears to come through is real life in all its gritty, ugly glory. Breaking Bad delivers in a way few series ever have. The casting is superb and virtually every actor is stellar. The twists and turns of the plot are delicious and the ride is as intoxicating, unpredictable and addictive as the killer meth Walter cooks up.<br/><br/>This AMC gem is every bit a premium cable channel production from start to finish. You will swear you're watching HBO or Showtime. If only every show on TV was even half as good! Breaking Bad deserves every industry award and accolade to be had. Re: episode 407: Everything continued to close in on Walter White in Sunday night's intense episode of Breaking Bad, in which the repercussions of our leading man's hubris the week before exploded heavily in almost every scene.<br/><br/>The episode began with Skyler confronting Walt on his insane need for recognition and potential desire to be caught — as we saw the week before Walt finally admitted that things are going very wrong — but he still doesn't want to admit to himself that by remaining in his current situation he will eventually wind up dead; otherwise he might have taken the business card Saul offered him.<br/><br/>Instead, he reverted to pushing Skyler away with lies and obvious tells — his stall tactics, which included laughing like his wife was overreacting and never directly answering her questions, have become so commonplace it's obvious no one believes them anymore. What was interesting was that Walt finally came out and admitted that if a killer comes knocking on the door, he would be the one doing the knocking.<br/><br/>It was explosive diarrhea typical to the emotionally responsive character, but for the first time it allowed controlling Skyler to see who her husband had really become. Naturally she bee-lined for the door while Walt showered and considered his choice of words, but in the end, even though she knows she should leave Walt in the dust, there's a continued love there that made her turn around.<br/><br/>For Walt, knowing that he is finally worth something to his family, that he is providing more money than he ever could legally, is what is keeping him going. As we've seen so many times in this series, until the character began cooking, he never had a sense of control — Skyler made all of the decisions with her bossy personality, he was dying from a disease he couldn't beat and despite his clear smarts; all he had ever amounted to was the ranks of a high school chemistry teacher.<br/><br/>Through cooking, the character has earned some sense of purpose and accomplishment, and his need for others to acknowledge and respect that will be his ultimate downfall. It explains his unrelenting relationship with Jesse despite the drugs and now, lack of desire to seemingly live. Walt feels as though he can control his former student because he's always had authority over him, but he also uses him to exude that last card of power against Gus.<br/><br/>Gus, being wise to Walt's many character flaws, is starting to break away at that though. By allowing Jesse a sense of purpose, he's pulling him away from Walt, as the latter figured out in Sunday's episode. Unfortunately, since Walt has made everything about him from Day 1 and never sincerely been out to protect Jesse, Walt's discovery sounded more like another self-concerned rant rather than actual concern.<br/><br/>The problem, as was foreshadowed in the conversation between Walt and his former car wash boss when he picked up the keys, is that Walt isn't tough enough to be the "boss." Sure he wants all the power and recognition that comes along with the title, but when it comes down to the nitty gritty, he isn't willing to get dirty. The scene where he paid off the Honduras workers to clean his lab proved as much, as he sat back and enjoyed a cup of coffee the way his former boss predicted he would.<br/><br/>God complexes can only take a character so far, and there are plenty of bombs ticking near this one. Between Skyler, Hank, Gus and now Gus' enemies, every facet of Walt's life is chipping away. It's no longer a question of whether or not he will survive; it's a question of who will be the one to pull the trigger. This show is a mystery to me. I finished season 1 a few minutes ago which I had started a few days back. I don't really dig "Drama" genre that well unless it has something extraordinary to add to it, much less the real-life day-to-day stuff. This show, somehow, falls into that category for me. But there is something about it that makes me go back to it again and again. Bryan Cranston makes you feel sorry for him, embarrassed for him, feel his insecurity, feel his stupidity, feel his determination, watch him in awe and be blown over every once in a while. Aaron Paul, from what I've seen, is just fantastic, best character apart from Bryan. This guy really pulls off the irony and the associated comedy really well. A very different and fresh show. Have a watch. Good chance you'd like it. Pretty sure you never thought about Chemistry this way. Cheers! Few times I've become addicted to a TV series. I started with Breaking Bad just randomly, and I don't regret it. Just watch the first episode and you will know what I mean.<br/><br/>Although the main subject may be a little bit unpopular for wide audiences and perhaps unsuited to kids and youngsters, I would recommend this show for the rest of us. The story goes about an underachieved high-school chemistry teacher and family dad, that one day is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. Since then, he will try to gather as much money as possible to sustain his family for whenever he is gone and to pay his cancer treatment. He finds a gold mine when he applies his knowledge to the meth business (chemistry freaks may enjoy the technical stuff in the episodes), and he finds himself and his business partner in a number of kafkian situations that will keep the audience tied to their sits. <br/><br/>Cranson and the rest of the cast make a hell of a performance (note: Cranson got 2 consecutive emmys for the leading drama role beating Dr. House and the Lost guy). In my opinion, special mentions are also due to Hank, the DEA officer, and Saul, the attorney; they make outstanding performances in their secondary roles.<br/><br/>All in all this is a TV series with a very fine balance between suspense, drama and even some comedy, with an original plot and with an outstanding crew. <br/><br/>2 closing comments: Do not feel guilty if you find yourself with the need of watching 4 or 5 episodes per day, and yay!, they are coming back in July 2011! As other reviewers have said, this is a fantastic show, which the awards are evidence of. I watch it every Sunday. However, the story line is too drawn out. I enjoy watching it when it is on, but when it gets to the end, I think to myself "what the hell just happened in that past hour". Of course the writers do this so one watches it next week, and the following week, but I personally think they should give the viewer a little more: A little bit more excitement; a little bit more substance. The show is likely best when watched as a complete season in an afternoon or something. The story line, characters and acting are all great, but the excitement is just not there This show has the best use of colour I've ever seen. Visually it's fantastic. I can see the story they were trying to tell but honestly aside from Walt and Saul there wasn't a lot here for me. In the beginning I liked the series.It was interesting to watch as them cook drugs. The first season was in line with my expectations. The series stirs some tension, but it was never like - the "main" scene. The action in the series is interesting at first. But later is seems forced and not as watchable.
I expected more from this series. I know this show is one of the most popular shows ever, but I don't get why.<br/><br/>I mean, is it just me, or is this show super boring?<br/><br/>I binge watched up to the second episode of the second season, after the third or fourth was already out. The video buffered half way through the episode, and realised I didn't care how the episode ended.<br/><br/>I'd only lasted that long because I like Bryan Cranston.<br/><br/>After the show was already over, I had nothing to do, so I binged up to the last season. I didn't bother watching the last 5 or 6 episodes and don't plan to.<br/><br/>Instead I just YouTubed the last 5 minutes and called it done.<br/><br/>The whole show was just 5 minutes (in a "good" episode) of something happening and 40 of stretched out filler, and whole scenes where literally nothing is said or done..<br/><br/>As far as I can tell, every episode is: nothing happens, nothing happens, something happens for 2 minutes, Jessie screws it up, then nothing happens, nothing happens, credits. There are many unnecessary things in the plot. It feels like they didn't use their common sense at certain episodes.
Overall it's the worst series except for the acting. This show started off mildly engaging and plausible, but by the second season it descended into an infinite regression of the ludicrous, and with each scene, episode, and season it not only became more ludicrous but duller too. I know I am almost alone here in my view of this The Emperor's New Clothes of a series... Not very good story honestly so many hetter shows. This show is boring, it is literally the same episode for 5 seasons. Better call Saul is 10x better don't waste your time on this show I watched this TV-show twice, to be precise probably 1.85 times. Somehow first time I didn't finish it and on the second run was determined to get to the end as a bull pursuing its target. Why? First of all, it is considered to be "one of the best TV-shows of all times" and secondly I kind of wanted to finish off what I have started.<br/><br/>I can see why people love the idea. It is so close to reality, meaning the problems with the system in general and the cruelty of the world. The character development is on point and is not straightforward at all.<br/><br/>However, I have a big problem with the show overall. To my personal beliefs there was too much drag, I know a lot of examples where really deep characters were introduced and finished with an immense emotional explosion in a matter of several episodes. In this particular case, I had a huge struggle with getting past 3, even 4 seasons. I don't know why there were so many uncomfortable scenes that I wanted to skip.<br/><br/>I consider the fifth season a real winner, although it had many downs. The ending was powerful and definitely worth watching, the problem is that you need to experience that distorted relationship of main characters to feel it fully.<br/><br/>In the stretch of the show you root for plenty of heroes, you hate them sometimes and then get back those warm feelings. Bryan Cranston really pulled out the big guns and Aaron Paul stood right beside him. This duo indeed is iconic, however, hats off to Dean Norris who outperformed all my expectations and made you interested in his character right to the end. These three are not the only diamonds of the show, but for me - the brightest.<br/><br/>I stay by my word and cannot stress enough that despite all of its intensity, violence, ruthlessness the show is a bit stretched in time. I know many people that could not go further than 2 or 3 seasons and having watched the ending I can say that they have lost quite a bit but I can understand why.<br/><br/>Due to this, I cannot say that this is one of the best TV shows of all the time. It is great, but not the king of the mountain as here it is literally "through the thorns to the stars". Breaking bad focuses on a man named Walter White (Bryan Cranston). A Mild-mannered chemistry teacher who despite being happily married to his wife Skyler (Anna Gunn) and a loving father to his disabled son Walter Jr. (RJ Mitte) is somewhat dissatisfied with the life of mediocrity that he has settled for. Shortly after Walt's 50th birthday he is diagnosed terminal lung cancer and thus begins the biggest mid life crisis in history.<br/><br/>With this news and his certainty that it will bankrupt his family Walt in a desperate attempt to assure his family's financial well- being he begins cooking methamphetamine with former pupil Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul). Along the way Walt must juggle his family, his newly found life of crime, the evasion of DEA Brother-in-law Hank Schrader (Dean Norris), rival drug dealers and most of all his own personal demons. <br/><br/>Breaking bad is one of the best dramas put on big or small screen. In normal circumstances one may find it easy to anticipate where the show is going and what the plot will focus on; Walter's quest to set up his family's financial future right? Wrong. Breaking bad focuses on the on process of the protagonist's degrading humanity as he turns from a mild-mannered door mat to murderous drug kingpin named Heisenberg. Yet even still Walter manages to at least receive sympathy from viewers and this is thanks to subtle, versatile performance by Bryan Cranston who had four emmy awards to his name when the series concluded. <br/><br/>For those thinking about watching Breaking Bad for the first it's important to bear in mind that Breaking Bad has more of a studied build up in early episodes which maybe as well as the hype seem to be thought of as slow by some yet it is all build up and at some point most likely towards the end of season two you will become hooked and won't be able to take your eyes away from Walter for a second. <br/><br/>Another thing I must say that separates Breaking Bad from a lot of other TV dramas which were excellent the final episodes and the finale especially leave the viewers so satisfied that'll they'll want to start watching it all again. JUST an amazing piece of work. From the beginning, Walt remains methodical in his attempt and success to rise in the "Empire" business. Jesse Pinkman, (Aaron Paul) delivers a great break out performance as a troubled man who gets blackmailed into working with his old High School Chemistry teacher, Walter White. He gets dragged deeper into a dark world of, drugs, cartel, guns, Crazy 8, Uncle Tio and more. I freaking love this show. From the chicken brothers, Los Pollos Hermanos, to Todd, a creepy boy next door looking kid with evil intentions and family. Glad to call many of the cast my friends.The Salamanca twins, Daniel and Luis Moncada pull off a superb performance. Breath taking. This show has you sitting on edge every episode. BREAKING BAD is best serial in the television history. This show is beyond comparison. Many people's and critics compare this show with Game of Thrones but Breaking Bad is far much better. I watched Game of Thrones and yeah it's good. But not good as Breaking Bad because Breaking Bad is perfect show.<br/><br/>I can give this show 100 stars out of 10. Story is brilliant and well told. It's perfectly balanced. If I talk about performances then I can say every actor plays their characters beautifully. Bryan Cranston as Walter White is great. What an acting by Bryan. Aaron Paul as Jessie and Anna Gunn as Skyler is Great. Betsy Brandt, RJ Mitte and Dean Norris are great supporting actors. Bod Odenkirk as Saul is a great comical character.<br/><br/>This show is best. For me BREAKING BAD is the best serial ever made in TV shows history.. Must Watch Show. Thanks to VINCE GILLIGAN... The specialty of this show is, the consistency. Through out the series(except for 'Fly';was bit of boring)in every episode the suspense, intelligence in every second of the script was displayed.<br/><br/>I would say almost every character did a fabulous job. Walter White, Jr. White, Hank, Jesse, Todd's crew, Skyler, Mile, Gus were exceptional.<br/><br/>I think the show scores highly, with the perfect end of the show. Some people say the show has a tragic end, but some people say it doesn't. Isn't that awesome. A show has a fabulous end and different dimensions to the end. There are no words to fully describe "Breaking Bad". It is truly a show of its own. Its a show that draws such a personal attachment to all the characters...a show that make you feel with the story and leaves you every single episode wanting to hit "Play Next Episode" on your Netflix account. Sure some episodes are slow but its for a reason, every second of every episode is for a reason. If you have been living under a rock for the last few years and haven't watched this show...I suggest you do. Its the greatest show in TV history and there will never be another like it! Its dark yet has humorous moments and will leave you at the edge of your couch every time! WATCH BREAKING BAD!!!!!! Breaking Bad has every aspect of a show that could possibly be right right. The characters, the drama, the acting, the cinematography, directing, editing, suspense, action, and writing. It is perhaps the most baffling, surprising, pleasing television series ever to enter production. Breaking Bad sure was good, but who doesn't know that now? This review is for those of you who haven't seen it, and the review is simply telling those of you who haven't seen it one simple little thing, a thing so simple it will change your aspect of life forever: What are you doing with your life? You missed a major landmark in Earth. Go watch it! Breaking Bad may just be the best thing I have ever seen on TV. <br/><br/>Brian Cranston and Aaron Paul are magnificent as two characters almost everyone finds interesting. <br/><br/>I started watching this thing in a very unsympathetic mood, but the premise interested me.<br/><br/>Once I got through about episode #3, though, I was continually amazed at the way the story grabbed on to me and just would not let go. <br/><br/>All the supporting cast members are also superb, especially Anna Gunn and Dean Norris, who are like the two gatekeepers of WW's life, one from the legal side, the other from the family side. <br/><br/>I think the main appeal of this show is how WW keeps coping and over achieving in his new choice of vocation. He is at the same time the most unlikely drug lord and the most brilliant manipulator of those around him. It's just amazing to watch all the machinations he comes up with to stay on his game when you don't think he has a chance of surviving. <br/><br/>Special kudos for RJ Mitte as Walter Jr.--he is a fascinating character; both sympathetic and assertive. <br/><br/>Walter can be such a jerk, but you just keep rooting for him, warts and all. He's the ultimate underdog of TV drama characters. And America loves an underdog, don't we? First of all, I really liked this series, and think the direction and acting was excellent. That said, I must ask "why the hell couldn't they get a native Spanish speaker to play the part of Gustavo Fring?" It is more than apparent that first, he is not a native Spanish speaker, and second, in no way resembles or speaks like a Chilean. I mean, c'mon - some 16% of the population of the U.S. is Hispanic, and in the huge pool of people they couldn't find a good or even great native Spanish- speaking actor, maybe even a Chilean? Even the main chemist in the lab in Mexico did not appear to be Mexican. To name just a few candidates for the Gustavo Fring part known in the U.S.: Edward James Olmos, Jimmy Smits, Andy Garcia, Benicio del Toro, Hector Elizondo, Alejandro González Iñárritu, Raul Julia, etc. Probably any of these very fine actors could have been coached to have a convincing Chilean accent. Héctor Noguera, one of the many fine Chilean actors, could have done the part without breaking a sweat. This is without considering that the character may or may not really have been Chilean, but that's another discussion, and in any case, he was SUPPOSED to have been Chilean, so he could at least speak like one. None of this is to disparage Giancarlo Esposito's work, which wasn't bad, although he only seemed to have a few facial expressions. Perhaps that was what the director wanted, given the character, so I'll give him the benefit of the doubt there. In any case, great series. The first thing that came to my mind about Breaking Bad was that it's a kind of modern-day MacGyver with drugs. Except that instead of a ridiculous mullet the main character has a moustache. And instead of fighting crime he commits it. Now that I think about it, it's really not like MacGyver at all. But there you go. Breaking Bad narrates the misadventures of Walter White (Bryan Cranston), a fifty-year-old, overqualified high school chemistry teacher who discovers he has terminal lung cancer. Having always been the quiet pushover type, Walter decides to man up and live the rest of his life on his own terms. In a desperate attempt to secure his family's financial future after his death, Mr. White starts cooking methamphetamine with Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), a former student of his, and together they sell it to the local junkies of Albuquerque, New Mexico. However, Walter is a complete stranger to the intricacies of the demimonde and things don't go as smoothly as planned. The central storyline is one of an innocent chemistry teacher who gets sucked into a vortex of drug wars, death and business with mentally unstable criminals.<br/><br/>Still new to being an outlaw, Walter spends his days balancing between expensive cancer treatments, teaching at his school and keeping this huge secret from his family and friends at whatever cost. To make matters even more exciting, Walter's brother-in-law (Dean Norris) is a hilariously stereotypical federal agent at DEA, the Drug Enforcement Adminstration. Despite some difficulties in the beginning, Walter and Jesse actually manage to make a sort of breakthrough in the drugs market with their superior-quality product, and cause some unease at the DEA in the process. But the road towards the top of the proverbial food chain of the drug world is fraught with danger, setbacks and some very unexpected yet entertaining twists and turns. And most of the time the solution to Walter's problems lies in chemistry. He uses his knowledge of the subject like a cross between Batman and MacGyver to get out of various pickles along the way.<br/><br/>The cliché of Breaking Bad is the relationship between Walter and Jesse, two people from two different worlds who are forced to work together because they need to make money, but instead make a new friend. And some money. The whole concept would be heartwarming if it wasn't so old and obvious. The contrast between young and old, good and bad , educated and streetwise, it's all there to soften the tone of the show, and it actually works well enough. And in fairness, Walter and Jesse's friendship is far from Disney magic, as they habitually beat each other up and break off all contact. In the end, however, their mutual purpose of making lots of money always brings them back together, closer than ever. And everyone lives happily ever after. Not quite.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad is admittedly an interesting idea, at least. It doesn't happen very often that one finds oneself rooting for the drug dealer in the show, but Walter's apparent banality in the beginning and his endearing determination have the viewers on the edge of their seats every time he comes close to getting caught. Some time into the series the writers thought about introducing some comedy to the script, and it actually works surprisingly well. A subtle kind of humour very rarely seen in American TV shows can be found in some episodes from season 2 onwards, and they do add a little spice to the proceedings. After all, it's only so long you can entertain the great public by making a nice man do naughty things for a good cause before you have to think of something new. But so far Breaking Bad has been an impressive innovation that hasn't failed to surprise. The inclusion of the chemistry aspect provides the viewer with a little more brain stimulation than the average TV turd you see nowadays, which I find to be refreshing rather than a drag. The dialogue is well written, the characters believable, (even if half of them are about as likable as baby seal poachers), and the storyline unpredictable. All said and done, Breaking Bad is definitely one that's worth checking out. while there are awesome and successful shows like prison break, dexter, and house etc. I've noticed a trend that after around season 4 or 5 and so on. there is the sudden decline in writing and ritualistic storyline to the point of being unavoidably predictable or immensely CONTRIVED. this is where breaking bad stands above the rest.<br/><br/>one thing i didn't quite like was that walter's close relative brother in law just HAD to be D.E.A. that being said, breaking bad is surprisingly filled with ingenious humor and you cant even tell for the most part whether intentional or not...then hits you out of nowhere how serious it can be. the plot twists doesn't feel fabricated and over the top but its in a rather more realistic perspective which works really well.<br/><br/>unique show. continues to be interesting! Disgusting, hyper-realistically gritty, painfully frustrating in that "I don't want to watch but I'll look through my fingers" kinda way . . . yet eminently watchable and extremely funny. I don't know how they get through the situations they do but fate always lends a hand, albeit digging a bigger hole each time.<br/><br/>Every single aspect of this production is a little quirky - plot, script, casting, acting, cinematography, music. Nothing is straight laced which makes it endearing. But that's not likely to be the adjective that comes to mind after the pilot episode . . . think Tarantino does Weeds.<br/><br/>Just remember not to eat anything beforehand. Breaking bad is Good tv series but it's so so so Overrated Walter white is Good character but his not the best
breaking bad 1/10 This was an ok show, but it clearly has problems with characterization of the main characters, unlike family guy, a show with amazing characters and with groundbreaking racial commentary. This show is clearly a ripp off of the best family guy episode: peter sells meth together with his earlier student from science class(brian the dog from family guy)(brilliant episode). Just saw session 4. and i hate this stupid series.
i just want to see both lead characters walter white and jesse pinkman to die..
this series dont want you to feel sympathetic for lead characters,
it encourages you to favor negative characters. A marvelous show. It is kinda boring at the beginning but gains pace after season 2. First 2 seasons too have great moments but it's all dissolved in the family drama. 3rd season is a mixed bag. It contains great episodes. An unpopular opinion "Fly" is the only episode I didn't liked in the season. Season 4 is my favourite. One of the best I have ever seen in TV. Season 5 is a bit long but beautifully wrap up the show. I think last season only is perfect and other seasons could be shorter It's a good show, but only the characters that are in "the business" are worth listening or watching to, I always skip the parts where they have family meetings or whatever, super boring and adds nothing to the actual story in my opinion. -Hank must not be died but Jesse should be killed as it was a a reason of all the happenings at the end that Walter cannot overcome. -Skyler should understand the things done by Walter. -Walter Jr. gave up just like mother as a son must listen to father once more. -Why the Jesse been not killed as he ran .It is really good afterall as compare to Games of thrones i really enjoyed the time as well it is very true can be understood any time by the situations given in the play are awesome.In the mid it was bit confusing now it was very thrilling at 5th as well things were going very well on the right side but HANK was might be saved. If you are looking for a series that you want to enjoy more than any other TV series I'll suggest you to watch Breaking Bad.This series is far better than any other TV series I've ever seen and believe me I've seen many good series but no other series came even close to Breaking Bad.Everything about BB is just so simple and yet so good you'll end up amazed or shocked many times throughout the series.BB is like an everyday struggle of a common man who is forced to do extraordinary things that will shatter lives of many individuals.Strong performances from Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul.I'll say simply best TV series ever made and also no other series in future can take place of BB. #YoBitch I had to write a review, I simply had to do it. I never understood what all the fuss was about when people said the show was one of the best ever until I watched it a few weeks ago. I watched the whole five seasons in just a few days and words cant express the way the show made me feel about how shows should be made. I could just imagine the love viewers must have over the years for the characters. You just can't forget the characters unlike other mediocre shows.<br/><br/>The acing is top notch, the directing is pretty flawless, the writing is genius, the editing is so tight that if you skip five seconds you might miss a major twist. <br/><br/>To see Walter White grow from an ordinary teacher to a criminal drug lord is worth every bit of your precious time. The themes of Family, Loyalty, Greed are explored and displayed on screen with such precise accuracy. <br/><br/>If I have to recommend a show to a person on his or her deathbed, this is it. In the words of Jesse Pinkman: What you waiting for... Bitch. This, coupled with American Horror Story, Justified, True Blood, and The Killing is a prime example of quality television. Bryan Cranston is EXCELLENT as Walter White, and he's excellent because you don't think "he's such a good actor" you're thinking "that guy is f****ed up." Dean Norris is a good, obnoxious brother-in-law who gets in some hot water, and then some. Anna Gunn turns in a solid performance. Everyone else is solid too, but what stands out is the setting and cinematography. The deserty plains of Alburque, New Mexico are a gorgeous backdrop to such a bloody and gruesome story. The story itself is nothing new, but handled with a gritty style. Danny Trejo guest stars in a memorable episode and meets a memorable end. This is not the *best* show, it is *one* of the best. 10/10. Good solid work. I HATE roughly 95% of all television shows that I've ever seen. It offends my intelligence, my world view, and pretty much everything else I hold dearly. Breaking Bad is still television...but its *good* television. Sure, there are some cringe-worthy moments. The presentation of the Salamanca brothers was down-right uncharacteristically cartoonish and silly, with their melodramatic silence and oh-so-menacing expressions. But I forgive Breaking Bad. Jesse is irritatingly familiar, the scumbag bro you hoped you wouldn't see at parties, played to perfection by Aaron Paul (I'm hoping its not one of those "Keaneau Reeves" scenarios, where he is actually ALWAYS an airhead). You just wanna smack a bro, at times. But I got over it, even grew to like this character at times. Funny, the way the writers play with us, so deftly injecting and removing our sympathies at the drop of a pork-pie hat. Without spoilers, I've had issues with some of season 5 as well, as some of the subtleties in Walt's development, some of his lines, seem to have been exchanged for the more predictable and cheesy TV/Hollywood tropes. And yet...I am still counting the months until July, when we'll all be put out of our collective, suspenseful misery. Hopefully, in a good way. Because, despite these and a few other missteps, I haven't been this engaged in a TV show since I can remember. <br/><br/>For some reason, likely a surplus of spare time that we won't go into, I've now watched the first 4.5 seasons, twice. I am notoriously picky, and an infamous hater of most things that appear on the small screen. Why? Because TV most often lacks the focused creative genius that is allowed in film. There is no independent venue for TV, as there is for film. Either you're palatable to the larger American audience, or you don't make it past the pilot episode (assuming you aren't shooting for the dreaded network TV stations, where creativity and intellect are sacrificed at the whims of advertising dollars. I think I've vomited on the keyboard.) Amidst all of the prerequisite cartoon violence and melodrama, there are some absolutely poignant moments--and having watched a father of the same age (and similar life situation) encounter cancer--with a less spectacular outcome--I quickly noted that Walt's experience, sans descent into Scarface, was hauntingly realistic. The struggle of each character's encounter with existential malaise and disappointment, the will to survive, and the will to power, amidst all of the fantastic fictional elements, are incredibly real--and not just for Walt, but for almost every single character on the show; from Hank to Marie, Gus, Skylar, Mike, etc. Though I may not even agree with Gilligan's philosophical premises about the nature of morality (or maybe I do...I'll see how this ends!), I applaud the refreshing way in which it is being explored. Our protagonist constantly makes the wrong choices. Or were they wrong? We aren't exactly sure. Is there redemption? We don't know that, either. Now, again, you can bicker about the merits of this quandary, but the point is that this show is engaging enough to keep us guessing. Very enjoyable and entertaining.
Simple and easy to follow story.
Good acting and great story.
Not quite up there with the greats such as the Wire but well worth watching. I loved it. Only negative thing was very unnecessary talkings. Especially druggers' too much talk. This show was okay but I loved the lines that they had and my favorite character was Jesse. Decided to watch Breaking Bad after hearing nothing but good things about it for years. The first season was great, really interesting and intriguing. Then it just went kind of downhill from there. A few times it would pick up, but over all boring. I actually don't understand how this show has such great reviews and why it's said to be one of the best TV shows made. The characters consistently did things out of character, or I couldn't understand what their motivations were coming from. I would recommend first season, and after that just stop. It's not worth watching the other four. I wish I would have stopped and watched something else. Spoilers will be hinted at and will barely touch on the finale.<br/><br/>I got to admit right away I got into it pretty late, I watched it from the first episode yes but that wasn't until just before the second half of the final series had started. Like many I have only seen Bryan Cranston for the most part as Hal in Malcolm In the Middle (or other TV Sitcoms) and was hard to imagine then him in a drama I could take seriously. After seeing him as the only consistently good thing in the Total Recall remake suddenly I changed my tone.<br/><br/>The series throughout is full of great drama, with some humour too throughout. The series is always full of diverse characters, many with a dark side and there's few that I wouldn't consider forgettable. As the series progresses there's a startling transformation in the title character and his family. The sad thing about it was the thought it only took place over the space of two years (most of it covered in the first 5 1/2 seasons), which is one of the things that did make it slightly disturbing.<br/><br/>The humour itself varies from dark, gross out and mildly slapstick in a few episodes, Many guest stars like Cranston I knew as reoccurring characters in sitcoms too. (You may not look at some of them the same way again).<br/><br/>Warning most of the following touches upon the last 8 episodes.<br/><br/>But towards the end it does get intense and extremely disturbing, when the truth truly comes out then the tone changes drastically. Suddenly characters you cared about from the get go are portrayed in a whole new light. It definitely shows how the drug world can change people to rapidly yes but you may start to change your hopes for the ending. <br/><br/>Walter White who you might have once felt for was truly a one of a kind character you loved to love and at the same time loved to hate. The transformation he goes through in the first episode to the final few episodes is what made the show so emotionally disturbing, there was one episode I couldn't sit through in one go. I found myself hoping for the cliffhanger only to find there was another ten minutes left.<br/><br/>But sadly with all this in mind, the ending I feel looking back on yet was fitting and what I wanted but it was hard not to feel underwhelmed by it considering the buildup to it. The tone felt too somber, you knew it was going to lead up to a big confrontation which you get and it has some awesome moments.<br/><br/>But well the final moment just disappoints, there's a sense Walt and his on off partner still cared but it just left me thinking "that's it are you kidding me?" but still you hoped for the opposite to what happens between the two.<br/><br/>But despite this the show did live up to the hype, and is worth checking out regardless. Breaking Bad is breaking whatever limit there is for breaking the limits on television! And that, it is certainly the best when it comes to being the most bad-ass show there was/is/will be on television! I am a bit late to review this title but I started watching it just about last month and it is so addictive that it has had me hooked onto it until I craved for more... Breaking Bad is a journey of a certain Walter White, an underachieving man, a man way too qualified for the job he does, the wages he earns, a man barely able to provide for his family which he loves more than himself is left with no option when he understands that he has cancer and little time on his hands; to choose the path that seems impossible for him- a timid, meek guy....a path were red is shed for green...lives are put at risk on a daily basis. He takes on the role of a manufacturer of crystal meth along with Jesse Pinkman a former student of his, who is a small time drug dealer! And he chose to break bad!! I'd rate it 10/10 A Must Watch for anyone who has eyes!! In Jesse's words: IT IS THE BOMB, BIATCH!! I have just started watching reruns of this program and so far like it. After reading some comments I figured maybe I should hold off before giving this program 10 thumbs up. And then I figured, 'what the heck?' I usually write about a show the first time I see it anyway, and I will doll out accolades now. For later shows – my opinion may change – but for now – I really enjoyed the pilot and the early programs I have seen. The writing and acting all seems exceptional. The guys was a winner and is now a loser, spiraling further downward. And I bet there are a lot more out there now-a-days with such a poor economy. Well let them eat cake – right? Anyways, the terminal cancer this guy has; seems to give him the right to cause pain and misery and death to others he disagrees with or just plain doesn't like. Since this is fiction, I can look beyond that. Come-on, this is a dark comedy at its best. From week-to-week (or episode-to-episode) the stories keep me coming back for more. Weird or not-weird, that is what I want in a show. When I finally catch up to everyone else – I hope there is nothing there that will turn me off – but if there is – I will duly edit these comments.<br/><br/>UPDATE: I have made it most of the way through the first season and it is beginning to become draggy. Thank you whoever invented the fast-forward switch I would easily give this show a 10 if they would of gotten rid of Jesse early on. Instead of killing him off they make him a crutch for Walter. Walter ends up caring more for Jesse than his family or himself. It made no sense whatsoever that a major drug dealer would throwaway everything for a backstabbing loser. Plot was too similar to Death Note to really enjoy it though. First and last seasons were a bit boring but those seasons in the midlle were kind of nicely done. <br/><br/>I hated all main characters except Jessy Pinkman, they were so obnoxious and hypocritical I just couldn't sympathize with them. That being said I appreciated cast choices and perforformace actors gave. Also dialogues are very well written.<br/><br/>Remarkable shots of amazing landscapes and quality camera work alongside with those pros I've already mentioned make this series totally worth watching. Note: This review is about the ending of the show overall, but does not contain content about what happens.<br/><br/>The ending to a show is a lot like a break-up. Nobody wants to get hurt or to hurt the other person (usually) but intentions aside we're human and no breakup is without its scrapes. <br/><br/>Breaking up with Breaking Bad was devoid of emotion which left me feeling very empty. It's as though a great love had just ended but as you and your beloved parted ways you shook hands, expressed your feelings, and ties up all of the loose ends, never to return and seldom to think about one another again.<br/><br/>The problem is that this is not real, nor is it emotionally satisfying even if it technically satisfies and soothes the burning questions. People - we're not built this way. We not only crave the emotional rollercoasters that relationships and sometimes stories provide, we feed off of it and I'd say we need it. <br/><br/>Imagine, for a moment, that years later you've found a new woman or man (or TV show) that makes you feel alive. Despite your happiness, would you sometimes think back to that b*tch or b*stard who broke your heart and treated you poorly? Do you even remember the name of anyone you dated with whom you had a "safe" and "tidy" break-up? So it is with stories. We remember the endings and the stories of "The Sopranos" much more poignantly than perhaps we will "Breaking Bad". Vince Gilligan broke our hearts once with the X-Files and the mediocre films that preceded it... I hardly believed we would take him back, that he would then treat us so well, and now am in shock that I believed in the end that it would not feel so empty and bare. Walter White... you are dead to me. I have been glued to the screen for five seasons - approaching the end of Season 5 with reluctance. This is one of the best series I have ever seen with stunning acting. One flaw has kept me from giving it a ten. Everything to do with Skyler's pregnancy and with tbe baby just doesn't ring true, as if it was written by someone remote from the subject. Women of forty - however, glamorous - do not sail through pregnancy problem- free, occasionally stroking their bellies to remind us of what's going on. As for Holly, she must be the most unobtrusive infant in the history of mankind - occasionally someone shoves a bottle in her mouth or dandles her on their knee but she is simply not a presence in the family and seems happy to spend her time sitting in a baby chair looking demure. She also doesn't seem to be aging at the right pace. As I said, the only flaw I found. Most overrated series I had ever seen, it's too slow. I never suggest anyone this series After I finally finished watching whole five seasons of this series I have to say I have mixed feelings about it. Some things about it I like, some I do not. <br/><br/>Let me start with what I like. I liked characters and acting. Also camera work sometimes was outstanding and there was a lot of twists and turns in the plot. I was impressed by the actor who played White Junior, RJ Mitte, and his character, I was sad that he could not stay in love with his father, but what Walter White character did it is very logical that he had to break with his father. Hovewer, I really liked the sweetness of the character and the actor RJ Mitte. Do not think wrong about all of it, I liked other actors and the work they did, but somehow he jumped out of the ordinary. <br/><br/>What I did not like? I did not like too much violence. I did not like the length of the series. It was just too long. I think 3 seasons would be better then 5. I did not like unrealistic plot. It just was too unrealistic, I do not think that 10 per cent of it would of been possible in the real life. I just do not like that. It seems that New Mexico is not that of a happy state, as far as I can tell from the series and I would probably be not very happy there, or am I wrong?<br/><br/>All in all some of you might like the whole thing, I just did not that much. Don't get me wrong, i liked this show. But its not the best on television like everyone keeps ranting. There's a lot to like, and it deserves at least some hype, maybe not as much as its been credited.<br/><br/>This is a really dark show and i honestly get depressed when i watch more than an episode in a row. It depicts really well a downward spiral of a high school chemistry teacher to the ruler of a meth empire... This is no rise to glory.<br/><br/>The characters are very realistic and the whole thing has an air of cinema verite. Its not a feelgood show, its moody, quiet, and then loud, and then agonizing, and then grim. The episodes usually start out with some strange inanimate object foreshadowing future events, just odd enough to peak your interest. An eyeball floating in a pool, a tarantula walking in the sand, etc. The people in the show are unidealized and flawed in their own ways. Walter with his egomaniacal rages, sometimes to the point of embarrassing himself. Skyler with her underhandedness, and her sister with her lies and shoplifting, Hank with his gruff bravado. If you like shows that seem like they could actually happen in real life, this is the show for you.<br/><br/>I really liked Gus Fring's character. It was a really cool change of pace to see a drug kingpin so different from what you'd expect. Careful, timid, polite. Everything you don't expect from a meth dealer. Even before then, Crazy 8 and tuco both seem like gangbangers i've met in real life, and they capture the erratic sociopathy and fearmongering quite well. Jesse seems like the guy i used to buy weed from a while back. Its clear the writers have actually experienced a bit of the drug world before and are not out of their depth.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the show doesn't get really good until season 4. Even then i still wouldn't put it in my top 5. Its a well made piece of television, but perhaps its just a matter of preference. Its suspenseful at times, but not all the time. There are some very undeniably badass moments when i cheered, such as Gus taking on the cartel, or Erhmantraut's lake scene (no spoilers!) but i'm just not always in the mood to get all cynical about life like i do after watching Walter for too long. I swear this show is gonna turn me into an alcoholic.<br/><br/>Final note: I love Saul Goodman, such a classic scumbag and always with some really memorable quotes. I would not be opposed to a "Better Call Saul" spin off, preferably with more humor and dirty tricks In conclusion I'm just finna say that this is the most boring series ever existed dexter is better than this garbage It's good but so so Overrated I don't like it ever and it's so boring Watch narcos instead watching this crap..... i mean skyler slept with her boss and her husband even care for her...... he care and love her after knowing that she's cheated on him..... what is this crap i mean..... i think this is a great badass show about the meth dealer..... but this is just crap... Nice series actually but I think there is better actually Very good but not the best show at least i don't like the pace because at the first two seasons it's too slow then it increased the speed then the ending isn't what i hoped I didn't "hate" it. I mean I watched all 5 seasons finally, years after not finding much to keep my interest in the first few episodes. Reviews here, several friends, and what seems to be near unanimous opinion about the greatness of Breaking Bad brought me back.<br/><br/>The acting is first rate. The story premise and cinematography really deliver the proverbial goods. As an anti hero, the Walter White character is as good as they come, maybe the best.<br/><br/>But.<br/><br/>But, but, but. I kept waiting for some kind of breakthrough moment or episode where I could identify with a character enough to root for them. Sort of with Aaron Paul's character Jesse and his raw humanity sometimes. But the characters were so flawed in ways that weren't just human shortcomings, they were cartoonishly simple personalities. I don't think it was the acting, it was too consistent across characters. I mean moustache-twirling Mexican bad guys and chronically PMS'ing wives don't engage me even in a hyper-realistic set/scene with decent dialogue.<br/><br/>I'm glad that I watched it all the way through. I don't regret the time spent and now I will be less likely to miss popular culture references to this series.<br/><br/>But.<br/><br/>But, but, but. I think it's pretty overrated. I'm unlikely to ever watch it again. I think if you are web series viewer you must watch breaking bad once in your life A 5 seasons show, 3 of them are boring and full of nonsence and fillings...
seasons 4 and 5 might take 6/10 for me Great show and great characters but i think this show is overrated in my opinion. GOT in my opinion is still the best show ever made i have seen GOT 8 times and it is still great! They just ruined every character in season 5.
Before watching season 5 I rated the series 9 but now it's just 7. Don't know what all the fuss is about, the characters just lurch from one disaster to another. Mr White even says 1 step forward, 2 steps back. One of the most boring TV shows ever. I will never get the time back that I dedicated to watching all of it. There is no question that this show broke new ground. But I would never give it 10/10. I really liked it up to season 3. After that, I lost interest. It plunged into darkness as a way to justify its name. And as a result, all the depth and richness of what it could be was lost. One of the best series in the world with a sad finish As a series in itself, Breaking Bad is both entertaining and well made, and while a little slow at times if you can make it through the 'action' makes up for it, usually towards the end of each series. Though I'll go into a little detail about this later. <br/><br/>I think one of the largest letdowns of this series is the hype it gets. Saying that 'This is the best show made on Television ever', as it seems so many people do just highlights the fact that they are a little naive to better programs, or that they're used to watching lower quality 'junk TV' such as CSI and the likes. Because of this comparing Breaking Bad with other dramas considered to be on similar levels; The Wire, Twin Peaks, Game Of Thrones and of course Six Feet Under will really just disappoint you a little - at least it did for me. <br/><br/>Content wise there's a lot going for it. The concept is great and I love being able to watch his drug empire grow from scratch throughout the series. The action scenes are very entertaining (if you like action scenes) and it looks like no expense has been spared during these sequences. Overall the plot is good and well structured and easy to keep track of even if you zone out a little. For the most part the acting is to a great standard, and Bryan Cranston (Hal :P ) being probably the perfect man for the job. <br/><br/>However:<br/><br/>Unfortunately the series isn't perfect, and there are quite a few things that annoyed me during the program. Probably the biggest one was the sickly sweet happy family vibe with the disabled son and the typical wife. I'm not American but I like to think that they don't fit the stereotype. I also found both the character development and script quite flawed throughout and I don't think I'm alone in this. Most of the characters aren't really likable, or dislikable, they're just filler for the few more interesting characters such as Walt, Jesse, Gus etc. and this is what really lets the show down (for me at least). It's like they had a budget, spent it all on visuals and then didn't bother employing scriptwriters of any notable worth. <br/><br/>I'd like to add that although I found the character development flawed and a little shallow, that doesn't mean I don't think they tried. Throughout we see Walt become less and less of his old self and this is very noticeable, but again I think the scriptwriters let this down and they didn't take this as far or as deep as it could have been. - Character development of good note however was between Jesse and Mike towards the end as Mike began to take Jesse under his wing :)<br/><br/>however this is sadly let down by other characters, my least favourite of which being the woman who has 'contacts in Europe'. She lacks any sense of realism at all, I mean I'm sorry but you don't get into the high quantity international methamphetamine trade when you firstly meet in a public location to talk business, and secondly are very timid and easily shaken. There are a fair amount more characters like this in the show and they really prevent you from being drawn in.<br/><br/>I find the entire show also lacks character, it's very typical American high octane car chases in big black SUV's and the directing lacks any artistic merit, giving it the look and feel of so many other shows out there, and while it does try its best to be messed up and show the dark side of it all, really it fails massively. <br/><br/>There's more I could say but really it's pointless. Essentially nothing in this program is bad by any means, it's not realistic at all but that doesn't matter because it is still entertaining. If you don't take television or film too seriously then you'll probably love it, it's on the same level as Dexter or House, but just don't think of it as this revolutionary groundbreaking television achievement because it's not, and the hype will probably die down massively when Game of Thrones starts again and everyone goes back to being obsessed with that (granted I think with better reason). :) I had heard SOOO many good things about this show so Initially I was very excited to start it. The first two seasons were very boring and literally nothing happened in them. Then when it finally started getting good one of my favorite characters gets killed. I will not be watching this show again, just awful. They could have put all the episodes of every season just into the length of a movie. It's the same thing over and over again.<br/><br/>Eyes glazed over many many times watching the episodes, would never watch again 👎🏻 I mean really the story is nice. But really It is so slow i do not want to wait 44 min for Mr.white to say we need to talk. Nether I want to know what does his wife feel. I really do not care. Give me story about drug and keep going with it. It is like they don't know how to make it long to they just filled it with family issues that nobody care about. Yes part of the family is important for the story but I think it is too much to the point where it is so boring. This show was good. It kept me entertained, and bored, for a lot of it. I usually have a hard time finishing a series but this one I made it to the end, so that says something. But on the other hand there are just SO many plot holes and things that just don't make sense. One of my biggest pet peeves was the baby, the family had a child, but most of the time the baby was nowhere to be found. Would a 1 year old child be anywhere but with its parents? It's like the producers just forgot for half a season that there should be a kid in a lot of these scenes. Near the end they started to have the kid around more but still, just couldn't get past how they could miss something like that. Another thing is the characters personalities. One episode they hate each other and try to kill each other until the show starts to get boring and there's not much else to do, then the characters all of a sudden love each other and want to work together again. Then something ridiculous happens and they want nothing to do with each other again. Or the cancer, once Walt went into remission, there was no mention Whatsoever of the cancer. It's like it never happened. And then the science part of it, which is huge, is just not at all realistic. Blue meth, not possible. That acid melting through a bathtub and floor, not possible. Not sure if all this was just laziness or lack of research, but this was definitely not one of the best shows out there.<br/><br/>I would give it a lower rating just because of how bad it all is after putting some logic to it, but it did keep me watching. I don't understand the hype the hoopla the show has. So i started watching it and season after season i hope it will get better, intelligent and more gripping but it failed on all counts. So many people told me to watch this. Turned out to be hours of boredom punctuated with the odd good moment. I am used to sharp, intelligent scripts from the US shows that I love - Sopranos, The Wire etc. This show is neither sharp, nor intelligent. I found no emotional involvement with any of the intensly unlikable characters. It got so bad that when any of the huge number of life threatening situations a main character is put in, I didn't care whether they died. (and frequently wished some of them would for a change). I am just glad that I don't have to watch Walt & Jessie sit on chairs in front of people who should be killing them for the umpteenth time. With a deus ex machina ending almost every time. One of the worst threads was the depiction of the Mexican cartel. Absurd. Just look at Sicario to see how it should be done.<br/><br/>Better than the Sopranos? Better than the West Wing? I am afraid not. Not even on the same planet let alone ball park. Just posted one on the title two days ago. Have to write another right in the middle watching S5E11 -- whatever this is, the plot at this point is simply over-stretched and full of holes. Really? Using a "confession video" as a threat? Is that a joke? Is there a point to Pinkman's sudden virtual-signaling money tossing? Why not develop Pinkman character with a little more depth, rather than just painting him as a helpless addict, a puppet of WW? First of all, I have seen Breaking Bad series after watching Ozark. It's bit too late to watch one the most famous shows of all time right ?<br/><br/>That's ok. Neither the title nor the poster make feel to watch. However, due numerous recommendations from friends, I decided to give it a try.<br/><br/>I would like to draw parallels between Ozark and Breaking Bad. Walter White character has certain shades which will not let you understand what's in his mind. On a contrary Marty Byrde character remains predictable and proves its worth in each situation throughout the seasons.<br/><br/>Jesse Pinkman vs Ruth Langmore: Ozark team believed in Ruth Langmore. They gave ample space and script to showcase the complex emotions in the heart of Ruth Langmore. On a contrary, Jesse merely supports/admires/have to support Walter emotions throughout. Probably, creators of Breaking Bad too might have felt the same and released 'El Camino' movie. I haven't seen the movie yet. Probably I will.<br/><br/>Helen Pierce vs Saul Goodman: This is indeed a tough comparison. Isn't it ? I love the character of Saul Goodman. However, I am more convinced with Helen Pierce characterization as a lawyer to mafia.<br/><br/>I would remain sad, If I don't mention Hank Schrader character. What if I say: I like the script work done for Hank Schrader character: It is more convincing, heartfelt, truthful, and most importantly it won't deserve to disappear in the hands of funny gang and hopeless Walter in a situation where good Jesse hides under a car?<br/><br/>However, Breaking Bad will remain in top list of suggested shows to watch. May be, because Walter White won't let you forget him after all :) I have the option of giving rating from 5 to 8. I go with 6. I have already stated the reasons I suppose :)<br/><br/>Please give it a try, if you like drama genre. 1st episode of season is a banger, after that, it gets a little boring with too much talking between family members and and it felt just a drag, last two episodes were good.
Season 2 and 3 are pretty good but first 4 episodes of 4th season are very boring, but the end is where you'll forget about how boring those episodes were. But till now, from my point of view it's not the best show I've ever watched. It's not even on my top 10. Well, It's good. It's kind of slow and suspenseful. But there are some flaws at some points where I can say it's not making any sense. I had different mind at some episodes which a thought I am gonna hate this but end of this show, was kind of sentimental.<br/><br/>The characters that I want to talk about, Walt's character was little selfish which I was assuming at some point. Jesse Pink, yo! I loved this guy, his acting is just remarkable and amazing, I have heard that he never went to the acting school, and he really excellent actor for sure. Aaron Paul is brilliant actor. As a drug addict, he nailed it. There is a genuine acting of Skyler White, which I loved it. Gustavo Fring, the man of honor, the man of well disciplined, I really loved this guy, the way he acted was just authentic.<br/><br/>It could have ended just after the season 05 episode 01, this is where it should have ended because it all seemed over in that episode.<br/><br/>Just good show, but not my favourite, it is seeming to me that it's overrated because I don't think it should be ratted 9.5/10 and there are many flaws. Like that threat video to Hank, Walt not giving money to Jesse; his half share.<br/><br/>After all the fuss, like getting rid from Tuco and his cousins and then from the Gustavo as he didn't deserve that, it could have ended right after that, but what...after killed Gustavo, Walt just stated to cook again???After all been in such death troubles, he still wants to cook again??I didn't admire that. It seemed little motiveless at such points. Well, it was good and just good. I have to confess that I wasn't a huge admirer after the first couple of seasons. In fact I left it for a year or two, before coming back to give it another shot. I don't agree it's the perfect TV series as many here argue, but it is a very good one.<br/><br/>Let's dispense with the negative first. I found the pace of storytelling slowed alarmingly every so often. This was my main problem with the first couple of seasons and even later, with episodes like The Fly, where the story arc (s) just seemed to stall and the writers appeared to be spinning their wheels. I also had a more minor issue with RJ Mitte playing Walt Jr. Whereas initially in the earlier seasons he looked pretty much the part as the teenage son, in the later seasons he just began to look too mature to be playing 16 year-old Flynn. I do accept that he would have been a difficult character to replace, but imagine if he'd been killed off. Now that may have been interesting.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad aced it with its cast creating many memorable characters. In Bryan Cranston, they scored an incredible actor with a huge range, who seemingly effortlessly is able to convince us, that this mousey chemistry teacher, has the smarts to become a major drug player and in the process, transform his persona across the series.<br/><br/>The supporting cast are wonderful. I loved sisters, Skyla and Marie, not just because they were fine actors, but also because they looked like sisters; one blond and one dark-haired. Dean Norris playing Marie's husband Hank, was an outstanding land-bound Captain Ahab, ever chasing his mythical white whale in drug lord Heisenberg. Giancarlo Esposito as Gustavo "Gus" Fring, the Chilean high-level drug distributor and fried chicken king in Season 3 & 4 is scaringly good. I also enjoyed seeing Jonathon Banks's Mike Ehrmantraut, gradually build up to playing a very prominent role in the series by Season 5. He is such a seemingly confidently laconic, but at the same time, intense character. Then in Season 5 we are introduced to a couple of unforgettably attractive scoundrels in Jesse Plemons's well-mannered Todd Alquist and the woman he longed to get closer to, Laura Fraser's fearful, but deadly, Lydia Rodarte-Quayle.<br/><br/>The New Mexico locations, especially those of the desert variety make an exceptional background to the action that frequently occurs in that sort of environment and the plentiful sunshine contrasts well, with the ever-darkening themes and actions of the narrative.<br/><br/>Finally, what also impressed me with Breaking Bad is the fact, (with the possible minor exception of Marie's kleptomania - not sure why it was ever introduced as a sub-thread anyway) there don't appear to be any loose ends left to annoy viewers. Everything that was started in the beginning and during the course of the 5 seasons, appears to have satisfying and believable outcomes. The most obvious and arguably important being, Walt's discovery of lung cancer early in Season 1, which leads to the poisoning of not just his body, but also his soul, both of which, it's not spoiling to suggest, end up being beyond salvation. I've watched some slow burns but this is way too slow. Each episode moves at a snails pace I got so bored while watching this. I couldn't get past the season 2 finale. I know this show is beloved by many but I just didn't have the patience for it. There isn't even music in most of the episodes. This show is probably worth it if you can sit down and appreciate the really slow burn. The author: (Vince Gilligan) was Born on February 10, 1967<br/><br/>After being diagnosed with a fatal lung cancer, a high school chemistry teacher cooks and sells meth to support his family.<br/><br/>"Breaking Bad," a new seven-part series on AMC about a middle-aged chemistry teacher in Albuquerque who becomes a methamphetamine dealer, The series has a slight vein of black humor, but it is very, very dark, The series is very enthusiastic and exciting in all its parts, And I love the main character: walter white I hate Skyer and her personality in the series, Walter White was a very clever personality and had a lot of trouble especially the part when he was stuck in the desert, The series is very interesting, how Walter White suffered, and how he succeeded in helping his family and their troubles, The series has a wonderful and dramatic ending, finally, I highly recommend watching this series.<br/><br/>My rate : 9/10 Can't find a word to describe my excitement after watching this series; those characters really go into my heart, and I already bought a T-shirt painted "Heisenberg"! Very good but it is too long 62 ep very one is 45 minutes too long but it worth every minute This show is very inspirational and unique concept how to handle normal people Mafia and never give up to our life Walter and Jade each had a parallel bond to each other, at least it is what clearing butabinasium claimed. Both fall clear and black and white. For as Walter is caucasion, that would not revolve around his birth infections. Or so you think. You see, I want a show that is not pandering to the youth, political stepping, or drought of ponkleovbis, and this show takes the three, and sort of concocts them into together. When Michael and Steve were going to the parlor to shoot Tony, you can hear the photographer breathing in the background. I am not sure if this was intentional, but it is very clear. In season 3, episode 8, when Michelle and Jade went to the beauty salon, the correspondance between life and roundness was present. The earth is not round, but flat, and it is very immature of the director to pander to mindless internet memes. Do not watch this show, do not trust the ratings, and do not listen to the reviews. I watched all seasons of Breaking Bad twice. It is by far one of the most visually-stunning TV shows. The cinematography is brilliant and it features very creative choice of shots.
I did not find the story very compelling, though it had some original elements. The acting was average, with few characters standing out, while others were cringy and unrelatable.
Overall, decent show to binge on. T's has been eleven years since the first episode of Breaking Bad was aired , and still it remins as one of the best TV series of all time .<br/><br/>Right from the opening credits Vince Giligan makes sure this whole journey is going to be around Chemistry . The Protagonist Walter H White is an over qualified high school chemistry teacher affected from Lung Cancer who surrenders to this sickness from the moment he came to know about this , tries to provide for his family thinking he would not be there for them in near future. Walter however chooses the criminal way to earn money as fast as he can teaming up with his former student Jesse Pinkman . As mentioned Walter White is an chemistry genius , he makes some really good numbers in the meth cooking business but with everything there also came the bad days , the series has shown us everything within its 62 episodes .<br/><br/>However the series always sticks around it's male protagonist weather he makes a battery or a bomb , it seems every time they wants to justify his charecter . Walter has always tried to justify his work by the phrase 'providing for family' however things went more deep and egoistic . The series got it's real pace at the end of season 3 which is after about 30 episodes. The Mexican cartel segment was treat to watch.<br/><br/>The only thing to remember from this series is Aaron Paul's acting as Jesse Pinkman along with some genius of work by Walter White. RJ Mitte has also shown some maturity to his character , Walter Jr. , over the years . However in its last episodes this show went into another level . The climax demands very much appreciation .<br/><br/>Though it is one of the best series , it's clearly an overrated one . Breaking Bad is an ordinary criminal drama with some special flavour on it . The background score seems to be normal . Though it is based on an ordinary social life , It's not something memorable. Jesse has always been the misguided innocent & Walter's character changing judges itself when he broke the bathroom glass of the hospital .<br/><br/>In the final episode , titled Felina , most of the important loops were closed with clever precision in what felt like the fastest 75 minutes of television in history . In his death, Walter White was able to exert control over his own destiny and be the man that Heisenberg temporarily made us forget. And now he will live on as one of the great TV characters of all time. Have u ever had insomnia??<br/><br/>But guess what,<br/><br/>You will have if u watch this show till end.
Man, I am like how can something is perfect.<br/><br/>This show is 99.1%..! Some moments just amaze, some sad some excite. It was a beautiful story.<br/><br/>Buuut, it felt like creators tried to fill it with senseless things sometimes so to make it longer and add extra hours. Just for business. that's why 9/10 First Season was good , Second an third was boring , Fourth one is to make you ready For The madness And Omg The Last one was A Shock ,The acting was extraordinary The Ending was epic.This Show really let you see what is really happened in drug dealers lifes. Recommended ðŸ”¥ All Love,for the Cast to this great work... I have no idea how such thing get the highest rate it's bad graphics and story I find it so normal a teacher have a cancer become a drug master I tried to like this series. When it debuted, I watched two episodes and quickly just stopped recording it. Later, after c oming to really enjoy "Better Call Saul", I bought BB on dvd. It didn't get any better than my first impression. I absolutely hated the two central characters. Cranston, with his mouth sagging open all the time, revealing his bottom row of front teeth, made his character look like an imbecile.<br/><br/>Aaron Paul, looking like a skanky little rodent from a privileged background and acting like a barely sentient child was every bit as annoying as Cranston. I've seen both of them in other work since then and they are the same; annoyingly bad actors.<br/><br/>
Maybe if the central characters weren't so insufferable, I would have been able to like this series. The main idea was OK, but the way the story was developed made the whole thing ridiculous. I despise Brian Cranston, to start with, and can't stand to look at him, so maybe that soured me on the series to start with, but his whole family and circle of friends are insufferable as well.<br/><br/>The wife, the son, the sister in law and the DEA brother-in-law are totally unlikable characters. Pauls' circle of friends are imbecilic and the constant nonsense about Paul using dope and making messes is ridiculous and unbelievable. People who do the things he did in a neighborhood like the one where he lives would be in prison in short order. This is supposed to be Albuquerque, not NYC.<br/><br/>The dvd sets had no subtitles and the sound levels were very inconsistent, so maybe I'm missing a lot of what was said, which could be why the whole thing quickly became uninteresting, but that wouldn't have made good characters insufferable. That had to be the fault of the writers and casting directors.<br/><br/>4 stars is being generous. I bought the entire series on dvd because so many people raved over it. I soon learned that all of those people would probably rave over a series depicting dogs crapping on carpet. The producers, actors and everyone involved with Breaking Bad are comic geniuses. Not a scene rings true. In every moment the performances represent behaviour that has never occurred or never could between real human beings. Somehow the television viewing world generally regards this comedy as serious drama.<br/><br/>Where to begin? Why not the crazy driving scene in episode 1 of season 1? The only reason for the comical driving is to produces a crash that leads to more comedy. Ho hum, so it goes - on and on and on. Walt has coughing collapses to remind us how ill he is between periods where he seems as fit as you (probably) and I (probably not).<br/><br/>By the end of episode 4 I'd had enough. The paranoia scene in which happy-slappy bicycling evangelists were seen through a suppose paranoid misperception as vengeful, sword-wielding, grenade-toting bikie avengers finished it for me.<br/><br/>Absolute rubbish, but if America can elect you-know-who to lead them, favourable opinions of televisual crap fade into insignificance. Some people have said outs the best tv written series ever. I thought it was ok. The main character was taken a little too far from the original place he started. The sequel to this was horrible. What makes breaking bad special from other tv shows is its attention to detail. Every part matters on the grand scheme of things. It is an amazingly well written show, and I hope there were more like it. I was waiting to see how GOT ended. It should be the greatest but they failed miserably in the final season Great Movie I would watch it on repeat had me on edge of what's next After watching El Camino, figured I go back through BB. Only a couple of episodes in. Damn, this is good tv. Highly recommend to anyone, even for a second time around. Breaking Bad along with Better caul Saul both break the mild where tv shows are concerned.
These are how shows should be made. It's worth the time to wake up and see.
sehr gut und super serie Breaking Bad is no doubt one of the greatest TV series. I was surprised at how hooked I had got to it. It is so addictive that I just could not watch an episode and not watch the next one. With a lineup of incredible actors led by Bryan Cranston, the show is full of intense drama, explosive action, mystery, suspense and a shy bit of gore. It almost feels like a really long movie with a really good ending. Like a lot of shows which rely on plot twists, I don't think Breaking Bad is very re-watchable though you'll definitely be blown away the first time you'll watch it. Best TV series ever<br/><br/>Every action has reaction and sometimes you don't have any redeem for it, that exact happened with Mr. White..
I'd just finished the whole seasons of this unparalleled tv drama, I would request u pls watch the whole seasons don't cut off till the last episode come.. the story begins with Mr. White and his wife skyler and challenged son Walt junior, Mr. White was an erudite chemist man & family lovable guy, he'd researched on chemistry & invented some kinda charismatic stuff, and started a company with his comrades, they were threesome but Mr. White sold out his share ( merely $ 5k) during some inferior disturbance in company, the rest of two co-founder got married each other, after a few year that Corp. reached on highest transcendence of market cap. around 2.6 billion dollars and Mr. White was teaching chemistry at albuquerque high school, he was quite delighted over there & sharing time with his family and brother, sister- in-law but sometimes he feels a like fish out of water..
When Mr. White diagnosed lung cancer he was in pickle, he wants to make money for his treatment & for his family that spend their live well, so he shook his cerebrum when he saw a junkie boy (Jesse pickmen) he'd decided to methylene cooking with his former high school student Jesse pinkmen in an RV, mr. White made a charismatic blue crystal product that was "chart-topping" in drug market, his product was on high demand he made a lot of money with Jesse pinkmen and accidentally killed many ppl..
When he become popular with code name 'hisenberg' he plan to work with guso he earned millions of dollars monthly, during mess up with guso Mr. White conspire murder to him & blew guso head away with a bomb..
Mr White brother-in-law was a DEA agent (Hank), Hank was investing on drug dealer & meth cooker but he doesn't know about his brother-in-law Mr. White is a meth cooker and his blue crystal product on the contrary Mr. White wanted to build an empire in busniess, he's consistently doing that business & he was also off the hook for his family, his wife skyler (Mrs. White) constantly walking on eggshell she knows that his husband is drug-dealer and due to him her whole family jeopardize, she cares her challenged son & little innocent girl, she started detest with Mr. White but intially she cares for him, while DEA agent (Hank) puzzle-out utter case, being knownst about his brother-in-law conspiracy he planed to imprisoner him, whence he caught Mr. White(Hisenberg) some scumbag murdered hank & they kidnapped pinkmen for meth cook and all blame come upon Mr. White, now he leave the town and bring the money but he was still desperated so he deicide to go back to the town take an avenge with those scumbags, he planned to slaughter those punk, he made an autonomous machine gun and killed whole punks, and liberated the pinkmen, but he lost his life on that occurrence, before died he gave estimated 9 million dollars to his family through charity..
So as I said every action has consequences Mr. White his brother-in-law lost their lives.

A man can be anything seriously,at one moment he can be a school chemistry teacher and at the next moment he can this most wanted man in the town due to multiple crimes including drug business,robbing a train, attempting lots of murders in his interests..I mean there is no limit for the character here to do things in the name of his family.<br/><br/>This simply shows that one person can be this much dark at a time and bright as well at other point.The one thing I liked about this leading character is he is just fearless to do anything,he doesn't have anxiety issues,he is not obviously coward at all,he is a real man,he understands that he is a man he have to do things that is best suited for his family,it doesn't matter for him whether his family love him or wait for his death,it doesn't matter his son is abusing him,he just want to provide the drug money to them.<br/><br/>He has this hard heart that he goes on murdering hell lot of people,but it didn't affect him mentally,while Jesse finds it hard to deal with his ongoing emotions.<br/><br/>Walter white is also very much greedy for money,it doesn't matter for him whatever hell may happen,he doesn't seem to be demotivated, demoralized to start his illegal drug empire again and again<br/><br/>He is right at his cooking after every tragedy,he is playing around and using his brother-in-law all the way,until his brother-in-law actually finds his truth.<br/><br/>I think Walt and her wife had hurted Mike and her wife so much,but they were still very much supportive at times to them,so I felt very bad at Mike's death and about her wife,yes her wife is kind of a thief,which found certainly unexpected at times.<br/><br/>
Walter White was certainly luckiest,smartest,selfish,rock hard character shown in this web series,where I think we must face situations in our life like this,I mean we can't kill the people who betrays us,put us down,bullies us,threatens us in real life,just like Mr. white did in this series,but we can at least forget,forgive those people and situations,get out of the city where you live,get away from the people who let you down and always go for a new start at new place somewhere,which may turn out to be fruitful for everybody.<br/><br/>This web series is so much addictive,I binged watched for 1 week to finish it totally. When you watch this show you will not be Able to se another, the quality of breaking bad, the colors is just simply perfect Parents need to know that Breaking Bad isn't intended for kids; its intense, morally ambiguous characters and storylines are a much better fit for mature audiences. The main character starts out as an essentially good person who's driven to extreme negative behavior (manufacturing methamphetamines and more) by depression and desperation; over the course of the show, his good side becomes less and less evident. There's a good bit of swearing (though "f--k" is muted on the network airing, but not on the DVD or streaming versions), frequent violence (sometimes extremely graphic) As a lot of ya know by now, BREAKING BAD is a hit show brought to us by Vince Gilligan, telling the story of a high school chemistry teacher named Walter White (Bryan Cranston) who gets diagnosed with lung cancer, so he decides to cook meth with an old student, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), to make all the money he can from it, and give it to his family when he dies.<br/><br/>Not every pilot episode leaves you with a bang. That doesn't necessarily mean they're bad shows, but instead they need more time to develop their characters and the world, like PEAKY BLINDERS or GAME OF THRONES, for example. With the pilot of BREAKING BAD, however, you're into it from the opening scene. The show just grabs you from the minute it starts, and rarely ever lets go. Throughout the season I constantly found myself drawing closer to the screen mesmerized by the out of this world performance by Bryan Cranston, and those around him. Jesse, Skyler (Anna Gunn), and many other major characters in the season don't get to do much, but rather serve purpose as conflicts and supporters of Walt, but over time they all really grow and also become phenomenal characters.<br/><br/>Vince Gilligan has such a perfect understanding of how to balance comedy and drama, because throughout the season at points you would be laughing at the arguments of Walt and Jesse and Jesse's stupidity, but then also find yourself taken back by some emotional scenes, one being the lengthy pillow talk scene, where Walt says he doesn't want chemotherapy, and just when Hank (Dean Norris) and Marie (Betsy Brandt) start taking his side, Skyler yells she doesn't want Walt to die at all. BRILLIANT ACTING on everyone's part.<br/><br/>Season 1 of BREAKING BAD in my opinion is the weakest of the entire show, but even then, it's a pure masterpiece and worth the watch.<br/><br/>Season 2 of BREAKING BAD picks up right where season 1 ended, and follows Walt and Jesse, continuing to cook meth, while the latter of the two gets more development this time around, presenting him as a more emotional, mature character, who faces grief of being kicked out of his house, and soon meeting a woman named Jane (Krysten Ritter) who he falls in love with.<br/><br/>Season 2 of BREAKING BAD goes on a darker route than season 1. With Jesse being the main focus of the story, we get inside his head and see his struggles, and it is truly painful to watch, especially in the last two episodes. The tragic death of Jane is such an emotional gut punch to not only the two main characters, but the audience too. Seeing a shocked, helpless Walt watch her choke (which he is indirectly responsible for) from an overdose and then die, making him cry is the darkest scene in BREAKING BAD history, and Bryan Cranston's performance in that scene is on point. The original script did not demand for Walt to cry, but Cranston getting so emotional in the scene not only shows his vulnerability, but also helps pushing the character of Walt.
Aaron Paul really shines too, his interactions with Jane being the highlights. From here on Jesse doesn't just serve his purpose as an immature goofball.<br/><br/>I will admit having one problem with the season and the show overall, though, which is this season's ending. Jane's dad is shown to be an air traffic controller, and the grief of having a dead daughter makes him distracted from work, causing two airplanes to crash and hundreds of people die. The fact that this was built up so much makes the ending more disappointing. The scene right before it, where Skyler becomes extremely suspicious of Walt and thinks he might be involved in drugs and leaves him, was a scene already brilliant enough to end the season with, but then it keeps going and the airplanes crash leaves you with a sour taste in your mouth.<br/><br/>Despite a pretty disappointing ending that does get kind of better on rewatch, season 2 of BREAKING BAD is another fantastic chapter to the series that keeps getting better.<br/><br/>As if BREAKING BAD before already wasn't great enough, with Season 3 it turns into a masterpiece. This season picks up right where season 2 ended, the plane crash, and it puts Skyler and Walt's brother-in-law Hank Schrader (Dean Norris) as its focus, showing how those most closest to Walt, are slowly starting to be effected by him.<br/><br/>Let me get the FLY episode instantly out of the way first. It is considered to be the most polarising episode of BREAKING BAD, with many calling it one of the series' worse, while others saying it's one of the bests. I stand on the latter side. FLY is the defining blueprint of what you call a bottle episode, and it is fantastic, from the usual great writing, to the performances, and it really shows that you can just have an extremely dialogue driven episode of BREAKING BAD, and still keep our attention.
While Bryan Cranston continues to steal the heat, Anna Gunn, Dean Norris, and Aaron Paul also REALLY shine here, the scenes with Jesse at group therapy and at the very end of the season having to kill Gale against his will, while crying, holding his gun, are the highlights of the season.<br/><br/>In this season, Hank starts getting in really deep with the whole Heisenberg (he doesn't know Walt is the meth lord Heisenberg) mystery, and it brings him no joy. The parking lot shootout that happens halfway through the season is mildly intense, and despite me knowing that Hank is gonna make it out alive, I was more revetted by HOW will he make it out alive.<br/><br/>Season 3 is the season of BREAKING BAD many consider to be the one that got it its attention it deserved, and serves as an intense, action packed entry to the story that only cranks up even more. Beside season 5, this is also the most personal season of the series. And it's always great.<br/><br/>After the murder of Gale (David Costabile) at the end of season 3, Jesse is now a target of his and Walt's meth runner Gustavo Fring (Giancarlo Esposito). The two know they can't work with Gus for long and his evil ways, so they decide he has to be eventually killed, and the entire season becomes a thrilling, heart pounding game of cat and mouse, that ends with a very satisfying conclusion, where Walt literally BLOWS UP Gus with a bomb. It doesn't get any better than that, folks.<br/><br/>Season 4 of BREAKING BAD is truly a work of art. Many days I say the final season of the show is the best, but then there are other days where season 4 challenges my statement. The fourth chapter of the BREAKING BAD series is so exciting and nail biting from its opening episode BOX CUTTER to its last, FACE OFF, I couldn't help but keep pressing next episode after next episode with each episode's ending. This season REALLY tightly grabs you from the moment Gus brings Walt and Jesse to the meth lab, considering killing them but ultimately deciding not to, all the way to the ending that could have easily worked excellently as the series finale, but then we got season 5, and it managed to still be God's work of art.<br/><br/>I have waited to talk about Gus until now, in season 4, where HE becomes the focus. Gustavo Fring in this season is incredibly menacing, and I would not only consider him the greatest villain to ever appear on TV, but one of the greatest villains in general. Gus is extremely self reserved, cold hearted, and when he snaps, you know things are about to get serious, like the desert confrontation scene in CRAWL SPACE for example, where , Bryan Cranston also shines once again. His performance in the episode's final minutes are heart pounding, and put Joker's laughs to shame. Walt's breakdown and taking over of Heisenberg is also my favourite scene in the entire series, and I can't stop rewatching it.<br/><br/>Season 4 of BREAKING BAD is a tour de force that keeps getting more intense, and leaves you wondering where season 5 will head...<br/><br/>After Gus Fring's death at the end of season 4, Walter White as Heisenberg now becomes in charge of the meth business, and during his reign as the new king he faces loss, betrayal and a lot more, that ends with one of the most satisfying conclusions to a story EVER.<br/><br/>Season 5 of BREAKING BAD was a joy to watch. A show I spent a year watching came to its end after what was five years of build up and a story over the course of two years, gave me so much pleasure, it felt almost like an honour that I got to watch it. Season 5 and the series overall has been so nearly FLAWLESS, and as if the first half of the season wasn't already engaging enough, the second half gets even better and then the last four episodes end the show off with something that isn't just great or a masterpiece, but peak storytelling, peak acting, and writing, and episode OZYMANDIAS is a blueprint of that. What I, amongst many others consider to be the greatest episode of all time, hits you with so many emotions, and Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul and Anna Gunn's performances blow my mind just by how unbelievably amazing they are, and Vince Gilligan's writing and directing, Rian Johnson and Moira Walley-Beckett's involvement make this the greatest show ever made, and I objectively say that.<br/><br/>We all suspected Walt would eventually have to die, and it was done very well, with him finally killing his alter ego Heisenberg, and dying from his own bullet in the meth lab he created, his empire, and it was just so fantastic, I can't find words to describe it.<br/><br/>Season 5 of BREAKING BAD and the series overall have been such a joy to watch, and I would say the same for its spinoff BETTER CALL SAUL, and as you know I cannot wait to watch the movie. It takes a lot to keep me invested in a TV series until series fin....OH LOOK SQUIRREL BEST SHOW ON TV EVER MADE! WHY DISCONTINUED ILL NEVER KNOW! SHAME This is one of the best tv series i've seen.
The characters of Walter and Pinkman are great. Absolute TV Perfection. Believe the hype. Watch it and get hooked like Walters clients. Peace It's very rare to find a series that keeps getting better as the seasons go on. In Breaking Bad's case, it peaked at the very end. Whilst watching I was hooked from the first episode, and I thought it was amazing then, but as I watched it more and more, it continued to keep surprising me. Bryan Cranston's performance is immaculate with Aaron Paul's contributing to my favourite duo in TV. The plot twists and element of surprise this show had on me is simply amazing, and I would pay good money to watch it again for the first time. Best tv show ever. Can stop watching, it's both painful and exciting to watch as time goes. This is not breaking bad.. This was breaking heart...... Just wow I am in the midst of watching Breaking Bad and I have just finished the second season of the show and I am still really enjoying the show and feel this season was a slight improvement on the first season. The premise of the season sees Walter White and Jesse Pinkerman attempting to avoid the DEA and deal with their crazy kingpin Tuco. Bryan Cranston continues as Walter White and he is amazing in this role, he combines the toughness and loveable family man very well and provides such a powerful performance as an anti-hero. Aaron Paul is back as Jesse and his character has a really tough time during the season, he goes through probably just as much or even more then Walter does this season and it makes you really care about his character and their relationship. The supporting cast also all do a great job, Krysten Ritter from Jessica Jones plays Jesse's girlfriend on this show and she does a very good job in her role and it is interesting to see how her character affects the overall arc of the story. I thought Hank was one of my favourite characters of the first season but he is given a lot more depth this season and he is an even better character this season. Also shoutout to the character of Saul Goodman who added so much charisma to this show. The story is really interesting especially for the first few episodes, you have no idea what is going to happen and the intrigue is huge to see what is going to happen to the main characters. However, I felt during the middle of the season it slowed down and wasn't anywhere as interesting before picking up for the finale but the pacing of the season wasn't as strong. The script is fantastic with a great blend of real drama with the appropriate use of humour to truly humanise the people and make them feel as realistic as they can. The style is great, it makes the drug dealing business seem glamourous and gritty at the same time and it keeps you more interested throughout. Overall I really enjoyed the second season of this show and can't wait to continue watching this show. Usually I don't put enough efforts to write a comment. However this masterpiece needed it all along. Perfect acting, amazing storyline, great get going. Everything about this series is just perfect. I've watched it twice. Can't get enough of this. I gotta say. I'll miss you Heisenberg. Feels like its a part of me U'all guyz who ever took a breath in the world must watch it no spoil no nothing just watch 🔥 I have seen the series Gomorra, that made a real impression and impact for me. I do not think you can compare these 2 shows, but I think because of that I am not too much impressed with this series.<br/><br/>I have watched many episodes a day. Not always to know what will happen and sometimes I did not want to see it anymore. The acting is great, the camerawork is nice, the characters make mostly logic choices and there is not much luck involved. It looks like a raw show, just like in real life.<br/><br/>But that is why I do not like some parts of the relationships and how the characters are communicating. Sometimes they look like some children who have lost their toys. Maybe that is the point, but I did not like it. And when they almost come to an understanding, it will go wrong again with full force. I do not think that is realistic.<br/><br/>I have also the feeling the series wants to be a lot of things together and that is why I am a bit confused. There is almost no gore, yes sometimes a few body parts are flying around, but suddenly you see half a face. Not shocking, but I thought: why? And that only happens once.
And the balance between serious stuff and comedy is tipping over as the series progressing. I think Fargo did a better job at that. Is it realistic how the drug world operates? Not really, you only see the top of the iceberg. The violence the drug world is using then? I have not seen so much about the all powerful kartel, but suddenly it is gone... So it is action? Yes there is enough action.
It also likes to show you what the actions do to other people related to the main characters, but also not too deep.<br/><br/>What I am trying to say is, I am left with a bit of an empty feeling, because I did not know exactly what I saw. So I think it is a drama/soap/action and it is a good one. I am not sure that I can relate to the main characters fully. It is difficult to know what is going on in the heads of the characters. Or maybe I am the idiot here...<br/><br/>So wanted to watch the next episode, I do not want to see more if it. It is good like this. It was a nice ending of a good series. You will never be the same flyer watching this amazing series. Honestly I was hooked after a few episodes! Can't wait for the movies to be released in October. It's about the drama it's about the performance of actresses Bxjxhxh

Jdhdhdhdbndbd I just want to say that this is perfect, isnt bored, and the end is the best that I had never seen. It is not a series if you watche the series it will become a part of your life you are going to live with them
Masterpiece Amazing & unbelievable acting and drama.
I will not see a show in this level.
Thanks Mr. Walt & gessi your performances are a role models. This is one of the best TV show I have ever watched from characters to story everything is just in its place. Waiting dor the movie now! I love breaking bad because he bring reality to this show Every action has reaction and sometimes you don't have any redeem for it, that exact happened with Mr. White..
I'd just finished the whole seasons of this unparalleled tv drama, I would request u pls watch the whole seasons don't cut off till the last episode come.. the story begins with Mr. White and his wife skyler and challenged son Walt junior, Mr. White was an erudite chemist man & family lovable guy, he'd researched on chemistry & invented some kinda charismatic stuff, and started a company with his comrades, they were threesome but Mr. White sold out his share ( merely $ 5k) during some inferior disturbance in company, the rest of two co-founder got married each other, after a few year that Corp. reached on highest transcendence of market cap. around 2.6 billion dollars and Mr. White was teaching chemistry at albuquerque high school, he was quite delighted over there & sharing time with his family and brother, sister- in-law but sometimes he feels a like fish out of water..
When Mr. White diagnosed lung cancer he was in pickle, he wants to make money for his treatment & for his family that spend their live well, so he shook his cerebrum when he saw a junkie boy (Jesse pickmen) he'd decided to methylene cooking with his former high school student Jesse pinkmen in an RV, mr. White made a charismatic blue crystal product that was "chart-topping" in drug market, his product was on high demand he made a lot of money with Jesse pinkmen and accidentally killed many ppl..
When he become popular with code name 'hisenberg' he plan to work with guso he earned millions of dollars monthly, during mess up with guso Mr. White conspire murder to him & blew guso head away with a bomb..
Mr White brother-in-law was a DEA agent (Hank), Hank was investing on drug dealer & meth cooker but he doesn't know about his brother-in-law Mr. White is a meth cooker and his blue crystal product on the contrary Mr. White wanted to build an empire in busniess, he's consistently doing that business & he was also off the hook for his family, his wife skyler (Mrs. White) constantly walking on eggshell she knows that his husband is drug-dealer and due to him her whole family jeopardize, she cares her challenged son & little innocent girl, she started detest with Mr. White but intially she cares for him, while DEA agent (Hank) puzzle-out utter case, being knownst about his brother-in-law conspiracy he planed to imprisoner him, whence he caught Mr. White(Hisenberg) some scumbag murdered hank & they kidnapped pinkmen for meth cook and all blame come upon Mr. White, now he leave the town and bring the money but he was still desperated so he deicide to go back to the town take an avenge with those scumbags, he planned to slaughter those punk, he made an autonomous machine gun and killed whole punks, and liberated the pinkmen, but he lost his life on that occurrence, before died he gave estimated 9 million dollars to his family through charity..
So as I said every action has consequences Mr. White his brother-in-law lost their lives. It's better than Rick and morty, better than Peaky Blinders, better than Dark and obviously better than GoT, too! Well, this review will not tell you anything new as far as a summary of events, or anything that isn't popular opinion. Most shifting through these probably seen it all anyways. To the rare few who havent. This has to be the greatest show ever created. From the start the show flexed its muscles on engaging story and Incredible acting. The twist of events that happen and how walt managing to keep the train rolling. Amazing talents of acting such as crawl space. The writing and story so engaging. Being able to blend comedy into serious situations without taking away from the gravity of the moment is unmatched and always timed correctly. Theres a reason this is ranked 5th highest on imdb. (Although , not sure how itz below some with less rating and less votes). The legacy of this show brought us better call saul and now the movie. In their reunion it was brought up as the greatest show ever. And modestly Bryan Cranston said it's for people to decide. Jonathan Banks interrupted and said it is. Which I got to say I agree. Love this show, But the worst character had to be Skyler. Talk about mental illness, leaves Walt when she finds out he's cooking, then sleeps with another man. Then gets a taste of the money and loves it, then finds out Walt killed people to protect the family and plays the battered woman all scared. Ups and downs highs and lows. In real life he would of left her back in season 1 and figured out a way to give her the money as a fake life insurance policy or whatever else for the kids. The best series of all time 😍😍😍
My favorite part is the end of season 4 I have to say that I did really like the show, Since it contained alot of action, drama, adventure, etc...
 I said this show must be an outstanding one.
But in my opnion it's a littile bit over-rated,
Since that there is way too much talking, Especially from Skyler. Way too much !!!.<br/><br/>In overall I give a 8/10 for this show and hope you enjoy it even more. I wanted to tell you guys many things about this tv/web series but i don't want to spoil you guys, It's just amazing, every character is pretty good and there are lots of scene that gave me goosbumbs like hell, I have watched many web/tv series like dark,money heist,game of thrones but still breaking bad is far better than any of them imo and i want to forget everything and watch it again. Every episode stuns you. The direction, production, acting skills, and the sound effects are all excellent. Worth a watch. About 60 Episodes, but I wish I had more to watchðŸ˜€ Perfect
U always want to see more.

Last series is amazing but the end was not expected Breaking Bad has in my opinion the Greatest Acting, the best Story ,The Best Finale, Pilot, Episodes, Transformation, Quotes to any show ever. I mean it is unquestionable The Most Perfect TV SHOW Ever! There is a term of researcher known as forshadowing, and is simply a wink or Hint in the story comes early to confirm (or justification sometimes) a event will come from, yet you are out of the outlet from the bottom of the table and if you can understand it will be expected in certain events and maybe predicted to the whole network. If you do not understand the unevenly, you will not affect your understanding of the network. The Breaking Bad series was full of many physical instruments and in particular the Forshadowing. In the second ninth of the second season, each of Jesse Bincam and the Walter are limited in the RV truck amid the desert for three days, when we lose Jesse hope hopes the wild building robot for their pork! Which is as a result of the begun and laughter from viewers at that time .. But after three seasons and in the last episode, take it to the catastrophic situation, the bottom of the robot operates from inside the car corresponding to the building, an idea that has been died by Jesse three months ago, saved both of the death of the investigator. Hi I am abadi this movie it's very good I want movies like him plzzzz Hahahikaghagj shsjksksksjshsg shjs scsuekeke shjsjsnssbvs The title of this series is Breaking bad.The genre of this series is a Drama.The country of origin of USA The orginale language english.The Number of seasons is 5.

Walter White is a chemistry teacher at a high school and lives with his disabled son and pregnant wife in Albuquerque, New Mexico. When diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, everything collapses. He then decided to set up a methamphetamine laboratory to support his family by partnering with one of his former students, Jesse Pinkman, who had become a petty drug dealer.
19/20 I like a series because the stress is present and action. It's a series that has several genre (police, drama, thriller and black comedy)
The country of origin is the United States.
The original language is the American language.
There are 5 seasons.
There are 62 episodes.
Breaking Bad is the story of Walter White, 50 years, a professor of chemistry at a high school in New Mexico. To support Skyler, his pregnant wife, and Walt Junior, his disabled son, he has to work twice. His already gloomy life becomes downright black when he learns that he has an incurable lung cancer. Doctors do not give him more than two years to live. To quickly raise a lot of money to protect his family, Walter sees only one solution: to use his knowledge of chemistry to make and sell crystal meth, a synthetic drug that pays a lot. He affers Jesse, one of his former students who has become a small second-clss dealer, to team up with him. The improvised duo set up a traveling lab in an old motorhome. This unexpected association will lead them into a series of adventures both comical and pathetic. What i like in this series is that there are a lot of adventures and that a lot of things happen to the main actor (the chemist), sometimes it's surprising, sad, funny, and sometimes even horrible, it is the mix of emotions that can be felt in this series that i love the most. In addittion the universe is quite special and the story is really intriguing, which interests me a lot.
I will give the series a score of 9/10 because i would have liked it to continue. The series is just over the top right from the start to the end. If you haven't already watched this series, please DO IT. You won't regret it. Number one on my list of greatest shows I have ever seen Bom pkrl :v............................................................................... "Breaking Bad" is one of the best TV shows for multiple reasons but mainly is that it have the perfect sequence of events (even if they weren't planned ahead before pilot episode) and the well chosen cast. The flip in Walter's life is the one that is of importance here but still you have a ton a lot of characters that do not fade away (by feeling they are only tools to showcase Walter's behaviour) but instead you care for them as they are related to Walter White by a mean or another and can play considerable part in Walter's progress in this TV show. Walter White has always been "Heisenberg" but needed something to break the shell to fly out. Its never boring and you don't feel a scene or episode is wasted (in general). The best series, all the scenes were so smoothly, the actress really were so good It's really good, but there's a bit too much drama in season 3/4, which is annoying af. One of the best tv shows I've seen, although I'm not that into TV and haven't seen a whole lot of it (haven't even seen game of thrones). But having just finished it and it being one hell of a ride, I really enjoyed it. I've been dipping in and out of it for like 2 years and binged the last half of season 5 the past couple of days. Things really hits the fan in the second half. The cast is great with well developed characters, although I still find Skyler annoying. They managed to make Walter White, who is a complete evil nutcase in my opinion, someone I actually rooted for. My only problem with the show is that big character revelations weren't done as well as it'd hoped due to all the build up. Like they'll not show the first time they learn something and just skip to the end of middle of that conversation/ revelation. Which was quite jarring as I would of preferred to see the instant reaction (although would be more difficult to write and act I'm sure). I also noticed a probably excessive amount of montages lol In season 5, which was probably due to an increased budget tbh but still it was quite a shift in editing style. Overall I highly recommend this show and will probably begin watching better call Saul soon as I want to see more from vince Gillian and this world. This series paints the ultimate anti hero story - beautifully directed and acted. The story will enthrall and make you cringe as you see the characters descend into depravity through the drug trade The best for all time
walter white and jessie pinkman the best ever
i love it This is one of the all time great series and great for rainy day watching. This is by far my favorite series... Everything is perfect. WATCH IT. The most realistic show I've ever seen. It's like a documentary, and I loved how they express their feelings and how real it feels. It wasn't just breaking bad for Walter White; Hank, Jessy,.... it was a breaking bad for all of them. Whoever wants everything, will lose everything and leave. Amazing characters and storrytelling is what set this show apart from the rest. It's heads and toes above from most tv shows. If you are among the few who haven't seen it yet: believe the hype, it really is THAT good. Breaking Bad may not depict reality the way 'Generation Kill' or 'The Wire' did - but then it's not about that, either. From an artistic point of view - performances, writing, direction, camera, music - this show is every bit as good as the other two mentioned above, but unlike those, 'Breaking Bad' just wants to entertain and therefore enjoys a lot more creative freedom.<br/><br/>The show plays like the daydream fantasy of any underachieving, struggling middle class family man who's had to bury all his dreams (I mean: who wouldn't want to be a meth-kingpin for a little while?), before it turns into a nightmare. One could almost say that 'Heisenberg' is Walter White's 'Tyler Durden'(for those who don't get the reference: watch 'Fight Club' - you won't regret it).<br/><br/>For pure entertainment value, this is simply the best show I've ever seen. Every single one of the main characters has already reached the status of a screen icon - when does that ever happen?! Most fun I've ever had watching a TV-show and an instant classic No review is gonna do it justice. I first watched it in the later years of airing, getting a hype that made it really addicting. After the series ended, I didn't want to lose that sensation and ended up listening to that Gnarls Barkley's song again and again until I got tired. For a long time, I wanted to watch again. This 2019, I finally watched it again and all I'll say is I got a different experience mostly. The series is full of so many details that I sense I'm gonna watch it a third time after another 5-7 years or so, maybe 10. The best show in its time! Unveils the curtain on so many different issues around how far someone would go to help his family. The characters truly come through in this series so much so that it's addicting to watch. AMC was very lucky to have this series on their network and I haven't been able to find another series that matches it. It came in with a bang and ended too soon. For many viewers but I think they ended it perfectly as far as the amount of seasons. They didn't get greedy like other shows in the same era. I'd watch this entire show again and again. Highly recommend this for anyone looking to get hooked right from episode one. Bing worthy show! Just masterpiece , its above all television show ever made. You get to follow Walter White and his story when he's very slowly destroying his life to try to save his family but everything just turn out bad and he keeps on going, one of my best series, you really get to know The characters Best show I've seen in ages...10/10 Highly addictive once you start you will want to go until the end!! Walter White (Walt) has a high IQ but couldn't always succeed in life, but an opportunity occurs just when Walt gets terrible news. The opportunity comes with risks and terrible scarifies that Walt normally wouldn't take, but the need for money forces him to take it.<br/><br/>The character build of Walt is unique in some ways - only a few shows have done as great as job as the character development of Walt. The world of Walt is not as "grey" as the real world and hence the struggles of Walt are presented in a different way. This way enables the show to present the real-life struggles in a kind of art form. This way comes with more drama, action and comedy than, probably, possible in real life.<br/><br/>Sounds great right? While the supporting characters have "reason" to cry. So, they complain about different things. The wife of Walt wants to get evolve with the world of Walt, but right away wants to stay away. While she doubting her life, she feels free to burden Walt with her troubles. At the same time there is a junky, that has a terrible life, because he is doing drugs. While, I hear you say, he is doing drugs because of reason A or reason B right? Hahahaha don't let laugh, he irritating character that destroys the TV show.<br/><br/>So, Walt is great and the story is beautiful. However, expect for Walt there are a few characters that contributed something positive to the show. Still it's worth watching, but there are better shows out there. Great story line with a great start but progresses slowly with predictable happenings. Wow what can I say...
I just love the series and didn't want it to end but it's to eventually<br/><br/>Think I will watch better call Saul as nothing to watch next...<br/><br/>Any recommendations pls guys/dolls Breaking Bad features Bryan Cranston chewing the scenery like mad in a desperate bid to show that he is a Serious Actor while everything around him is Three's Company.<br/><br/>Jesse and his buddies are morons; Walt's sister-in-law wears nothing but purple.<br/><br/>The writers seem to have learned how human beings talk to each other only from watching other TV shows.<br/><br/>During the final season the cinematography takes a turn for the Very Serious.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad is supremely delicious camp on the order of Showgirls.<br/><br/>1/10 if you take it seriously
10/10 if you watch it as camp The best ane greatest tv show that I have ever seen in my life ❤❤❤
-Heisenberg- This series have it all : good plot, bit humor and a good soundtrack. I must see 😍 With all of the skills WW had, chemistry, business management electro mechanical he could not come up with a cure for his cancer It seems like he didn't even try.. He could have volunteered with the American Cancer Society He ruined thousands of families while trying to save his own I only rented the final season at my local library to see what the hoopla was about. I know of no one who had watched the show so I watched it with no previous judgment of the show. It is captivating in a way like watching a train fall off a trestle Since WW's partner in crime got away, there must be a sequel in the works to be called 'Breaking Worse' Tooooooooooo Gooooooooooooooooood
Best series ever made Best serial rick and morty after that this but awsomr In my opinion this is quite simply the best non-Sci-Fi drama series of all time. It starts off pretty slow in the first and second season, but by the third and fourth you can't stop watching. I watched the entire series in the week between a Christmas and New Year on an AMC marathon.<br/><br/>In addition to impeccable writing, direction, and acting, it is actually very realistic unlike all those CSI-type shows. The drugs and drug-prohibition businesses both work exactly like this in reality, and other than a few simple substitutions (it's actually quite easy to obtain methylamine in bulk; pseudoephedrine and P2P are the chemicals that are very difficult to obtain in large quantities), the science is on point as well. It's also the most accurate portrayal of the behavior of meth addicts I've ever seen in fiction. Literally one of the greatest shows I've ever seen in my life. No one could bring that character to life the way Cranston did and Paul was phenomenal. Pffft. Vince Gilligan?? Evil genius. Better Call Saul is great too Breaking Bad is the best thing ever happened. I still can't believe it's over. ... just give the man some cancer bro! Jokes aside, this series is a really great show. It's a great cat and mouse spiel between WW and the FBI uncle. While some villains are a bit over-acted and stereotypical, they do play an integral part in forcing Walter White to evolve into the badass he is towards the end of the series. And one is quite torn between sympathizing with the protagonist and hating him for his lack of humanity. But it's not necessary to 100% like a protagonist for a show to be good. After all, character development is what makes a show interesting and BB clearly is a great example in this regard.
The camera and the plot are done very professionally and most actors deliver a great performance.<br/><br/>Pro Tip: Skip the Skyler episodes. If you're not into family drama, they can be rather boring. When the actors make the story the most wonderful because of their talent Love the series! Wish it would come back with Walter and Jesse. The Aftermath! Walter H. White is a chemistry genius, but works as a chemistry teacher in an Albequerque, New Mexico high school. His life drastically changes when he's diagnosed with stage III terminal lung cancer, and given a short amount of time left to live: a mere matter of months. To ensure his handicapped son and his pregnant wife have a financial future, Walt uses his chemistry background to create and sell the world's finest crystal methamphetamine. To sell his signature "blue meth," he teams up with Jesse Pinkman, a former student of his. The meth makes them very rich very quickly, but it attracts the attention of his DEA brother in law Hank. As Walt and Jesse's status in the drug world escalates, Walt becomes a dangerous criminal and Jesse becomes a hot-headed salesman. Hank is always hot on his tail, and it forces Walt to come up with new ways to cover his tracks.<br/><br/>Well directed throughtout the series, great cast, great acting all round.
Superb drama, very addictive tv show. Each episode always leaves you wanting to watch another. I haven't been hooked to a TV show like Breaking Bad in ages.The creator, writers, directors and actors have paid attention to every single detail.<br/><br/>Get on your sofa now and start watching "Breaking Bad" from the very beginning, and don't miss a single scene.<br/><br/>Highly recommend this. Great tv show. It's just perfect. Great actors, great, great story and great creator. thanks Vance! It's probably the best TV show ever. You should watch it. A brilliant series!<br/><br/>The characters are very believable and realistic. There are some truly funny moments that you can imagine would happen in reality when things don't quite go to plan.<br/><br/>Jesse is a truly irritating character, full of his own self pity and selfishness which I have to say is played to perfection by Aaron Paul. Would I watch it again? Yes, the entire and full set of series. I have to admit that I wasn't enthusiastic at all in the first 2 seasons. But it is really worth watching this show. Especially the last 3 episodes are mind blowing! Im watching the series for the 2nd time after 5 years and it still is the best tv series ever. Walter white his actor was great and every minute in breaking bad i cant stop watching this is the most goodest tv show i watch So great series! I am just amazed!
The best one I have seen till now Everything is just perfect! The acting, the music, the script, the director everything Just watch it. Then you'll know why it's a 10/10. Such a great show. It'll keep you hooked no matter what. This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad is a crime drama television sener created by Vince Gilligan. The show stars Bryan Cranston as Walter White, Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman, Anna Gunn as Walter's wife Skyler, Dean Norris as Hank Schrader, Betsy Brandt as Marie Schrader, and RJ Mitte as Walter, Jr. White. The story is about a genius high school chemistry teacher that turns to producing methamphetamine after learning he has terminal cancer.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad is a hallmark of television. This television series features a small amount of episodes per season but each of the episodes is high quality. The episodes are easily of quality similar to HBO in production and in script. This show had taken many of the lessons earlier television serials to heart and crafted something that had deliberate pace and writing. These elements made the show as a whole a complete package in drama and action.<br/><br/>All of the characters in this show embark on a journey in this show. They are touched positively or negatively by Walter White, played by Bryan Cranston, in some way. It is this attention to detail that makes the show prevail where other shows rush to a conclusion they have not earned.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad series retrospective<br/><br/>Breaking Bad got better over time. Each season improved on the last one and made watching the series more enjoyable as time goes on. It is this feature that makes watching the series rewarding as well. Each character and season builds history on its last episode. The series not only builds this but also reuses it in later episodes. Breaking Bad truly rewards the viewer for paying attention to the small details.<br/><br/>I highly recommend the series as a whole. Any viewer that may find the first season too slow should still try to stick with it until the second season's finale. Anybody that sticks around for this long will get to see how well written the series is.<br/><br/>Grade: A Amazing how can u match between breaking bad and game of thrones Amazing plot and acting for sure. Aaron Paul and a Bryan Cranston killed it and the ending of the show is definitely something else.
Gets more intense with every season and shows every well that every action has a reaction.
Worth it Breaking Bad Is very very good this review Doesn't contain spoilers Loved this show! Well-timed dark humour and very disturbing turns. Unexpected violence. The bad guys probably were a bit over acted at times but for the most part, an awesome series! I'm so addicted to it.. 
I'm on series 2 ep 8 at the mo and loving it 
It's just very different and scientific!<br/><br/>Since I've seen stranger things and was struggling to find a good series but this one is up there with stranger things and the punisher This is a brilliant tv show where ego and pride goes beyond any morality level. The story is so well tell that you almost don't realize the methamorphosis.
Bryan Cranston's Walter White is a fascinating caracter.
Take it from me now, when you start with this one you just can't get enough. Breaking bad is totally love. What an incredible show. A series of legendary deserves to see from all parts A scenario touches the reality of the very form Dramatic unexpected unexpected intelligent plot Professional representation of the role of heroism and the assistant wonderful wonderful 👏✊👍 Great acting, characters, plot, shooting, writing, all great. One of the best scenes I refer to as traffic lights...if your not sure if this was a great show search "breaking bad traffic lights" just a snippet of the heart of the writing that went into this show that had me hooked from the start - take the time to enjoy you won't regret Have you just completed watching this and came over imdb to rate it other than 10? Well i suggest you to go back and rewatch every single episode over again and come back! Still not convinced? Well then you have to watch this over an infinite loop until you feel this deserves a 10 cus this must be given a 10 and if not you havent watched this good enough If you are looking for an immersive story and perfect acting, you should watch this show. I have. Never seen a serial like this. I myself a chemistry teacher really enjoyed it. I'll never forget some of the characters in it like Gustavo heisenberg, Mike, saul, and off course Pinkman.
At last I want to add " one more season please". The best TV show of all time !
Yeah Mr.White! Yeah Science! I have learned to like this series. Put the first season and a few plots aside and it is a "must-watch" show. 
Season 1 with the whole corpse dinsingrated in the bathtub, the bathtub falling, the fulminated mercury explosion, were just among those things that pissed me off. But I liked Jesse Pinkman, who was suppposed to die, and became the sidekick instead. It took the usual five season to expand the lead character but it is worth it. Some plots are unbelievable (how are they sill alive ?) but if you go with the flow, just like with season one, it is pretty enjoyable. You will care for Pinkman (Aaron Paul), you will watch the good teacher on his highway to hell. I hated him with passion season 1, then just despised him. The whole point is to make him despicable by showing his true self. Madness. That's the name of this tv show wich has opened the world of tv series and wich is an will be the best series of all time The series generally is not bad
Watching breaking bad you feel very bored in the first 2 seasons and half of the third one
In the rest of the series it will be faster and better but there is no excitement
Things I hated : 1- when Gustavo was going to kill Hector salamanka how didn't such a man think it may be a trap. Why didn't he order one of his men to do it
2- how can Heisenberg put a proof of what he did (the w.w. book ) in the bathroom. Stupid
3- when Tod's uncle arrested Heisenberg , why didn't he just shoot him without letting him with nobody watching him to let him take his car key and then kill them
And a lot of stupid things like those BeSt TV show I watched it made me cry I'm the end and favourite episode is crawl space and feline By saying "the best tv show" i mean great story, amazing performence and ovarall characthers that make you care for them. If you regret watching this you are not human. Rewatching now that better call Saul is closing the gap on the timeline whereas by end of current season 4 we will be at breaking bad point in time. Already are just have not fully but when it happens I suggest everyone rewatch this and if you have never seen it you are missing out on best show in modern history if not ever IMHO. Def watch both but this one is a must see for sure! Better call Saul is def worth investing in. But both? Epic stuff going on here. I 'll make it short: if you can resist this, then you are one out of a billion.
In other words: I had the tip from a friend and from the first episode on, I could not make myself to see only one episode. At least two per day and I remember seeing five (and that was before noon on a Sunday...). Yes, I know I am weird, but I'm not the only one. I've never left a review on IMBD, this is the series that changed that! Impeccable in every way. Stunning performances throughout. 
I watched it only last year and am rewatching it as I type this. <br/><br/>If you're a fan of crime drama, this is the standard to which I measure any series. The best show to ever hit television. Every scene means something, nothing is wasted in this. Awesome, brilliant, emotional, and every amazing things This is by far the best tv series by a country mile. Writing is one of a kind and so is acting. It deserves all the accolades. At the end of season 4 you'll feel "wow that's amazing, best, etc." . But at the end of 5th season u will cry, regret. Cuz in Breaking bad you'll feel like living the series. They show every little detail in the show which makes us more attached, you miss nothing. Best ending with the intention to make audience heartbroken. Well done! I don't think a few paragraphs can do justice to the amount of hard work the crew has put into making Breaking Bad. But, I've been moved so much by this series that I can't help but pen down my thoughts. I just finished watching final episode of the season finale and I feel extremely satisfied. It's going to stay with me for many days.<br/><br/>If I were to get a bit poetic about my perception of this show, I'd say it's a beautiful painting. A painting that you can't help but admire forever. Strokes of five prominent colours intertwined with each other on a black and white checkered canvas. Five colours being the five main characters of the show and the black and white checks being the contradictory nature these characters display at various levels, various frequency. One colour influencing all other colours. Oh it's beautiful.<br/><br/>Having gone overboard with my admiration to the show above, I wish to deconstruct this work of art below. Namingly, Plot and characterisation, Cinematography, Screenplay, subtexts. A disclaimer well in advance - I have no formal training nor any background in movie making or writing. So do comment if I've made any technical mistakes in the below exercise.<br/><br/>Plot and characterisation: 
What can I say! A totally well knit fabric of beautiful characters. The plot can be summarised in three lines, it's that simple. A "good" guy turning a "bad" guy and in the process bringing out the "good" and "bad" of people he deals with. It's commentary on the struggle of humanity in finding order in a chaotic world. Simple enough ? Yes.<br/><br/>Characters. Well, no character is brought in just to use as a wild card to help the narrative move on. It's done mostly by some writers when they hit the "Block", one of the techniques is to introduce a new character and kill the character once its purpose is served. (A callback to the Queen's Justice of Game Of Thrones.) Breaking Bad on the other hand uses the death of the characters to escalate the situation and the move the narrative. Tuco, Combo, Jane, Gus, Hector, Mike, Hank to name a few.<br/><br/>Like the abstraction above with the painting, the main characters show various shades of themselves through the goodness and the badness, based on how the main character Walter White is interacting with them. This plot here is so amazing, they make the main character stay on top of everything and make the this character script the story, You see the trick there ? With this trick we're being exposed to how the creator of story is thinking, it's like the creators talking to us directly through the character of Walter White on the story goes. Bravo!<br/><br/>Cinematography and Art direction : No effort has been spared to make us feel emotionally connect with the characters, those close up shots really move you. Those wide shots of sprawling deserts, the Point of View shots during intense sequences. If you notice that sequence of Walter white sitting by the pool and turning the gun over and over you'd know what I'm talking about. Just one example that came to me mind as I write this. <br/><br/>Screenplay: I don't know if there's a name to this specific technique, but I've seen some screenwriters use this. It's to show how it's going to go down in the beginning of the episode and build up the anticipation of the audience. There have been certain interplays in a few episodes that subtly poetic. Such as Walter having a baby girl and Jane dying the same time while Walter and Jane's dad sit in a bar and talk about baby girls. Walter helping Jesse - his pseudo-adopted son - while missing his own son's birthday party. <br/><br/>Subtexts: A ocean of them. Everytime there's a TV or Radio playing in the background, the content playing on the TV or the radio is foreshadowing the show itself. Pick one and you'll see what I am saying. Thematic subtexts with color of the costume people wear. Purple. You see purple in an episode you're sure going to be awed with something critical to the plot. Those conversations between Hank and Walter. Every conversation, Walter challenges Hank in his own way. I am sure I've missed quite many, these things come to mind when I think back. I Loved everything about this tv series . Great Actig Great Story Great Direction and ... and ... and ....
WATCH THIS SERIES ! Comedy by actors show wit of the writer's and director who have supported the gesture. Gestures like making 'drugs' are based to the comprehension that drugs kill us. The drugs that involve the medicine industry are steroids and antibyotics which are harmful to the internal system of the body but the other sort of drugs are recreational meaning for achieving sleep. 
The actors and actresses while watching these Television Show were adults who had a relation who was mortally going to die. The example through the years are that actors who performed the series were doing their payed jobs and did not reveal if they worked pro bono or without money. 
Attention to the forty minutes series lead us to encourage the importance of being self agonized to continue living. Living after a certain age is the important attempt to 'not give up' to death which like in race hears the start and knows the stop. 
The attention to death is a passage to create our final chapter with illumined attention. Observing slips and falls in life because after an age the body is ready to have children over wasting the 'grey matter' that goes in using the brain behind the actions that daily we are legally here to perform after our birth. 
Responsibility like that of the persons in this Television show where drugs that killed humans in real life are consumed or created rather. The sequence of courage is to bring an important achievement in direction and screenplay is the cinematography of 'Breaking Bad'. I had to admit, when I watched the first few episodes of "Breaking Bad" I was quite unsure of what I thought because the characters appeared to be very predictable and the story wasn't immediately that interesting. I just took it to be a saccharine drama involving a man who ends up selling drugs with his younger stereotypically "comic relief" stooge.<br/><br/>HOWEVER, as the story develops it completely reversed the initial view that I had of it. I found it very gripping, completely unpredictable, moving and, generally, it is unlike anything I have seen from this kind of genre. Nothing feels forced or overdone. I think this is because the series starts off in ordinary surroundings and in a typical environment. Every character has a real depth to them, which shows how much thought has been given to the detail of the overall series and the direction it will take. Once you start watching you are very unlikely to be able to stop watching! If you're watching with anyone you will be both be heatedly debating what will happen. The improvement of breaking bad's characters is very successful.For example,there are deep differences between the time that walter white was a chemistry teacher in high school and other time that he transformed to Heisenberg not only physical appearance but also psychological attitudes.In fourth season,Walter said that I won at telephone conservation with Skyler.This scene is the best for me because Walter demonstrated the changing at himself very well. Breaking bad is the best series I ever see.
If you want to enjoy from your free time it is better to watch this series. Whole the time I really enjoy and at the end I cried.
I really recommend this This show is simply amazing. I wish I can convince Gilligan for another season as tears filled my eyes watching the season finale.You will enjoy the amazing cinematography of this show in every minute. The chemistry between Walt and Jesse will make you fall in love with chemistry again.
You will never regret watching this show. It may go on a slow pace but I think it is pretty necessary to go on this pace to develop plot 
Other than that it is the best TV show you will ever see in your life 
Every performance is top notch 
Especially Bryan Cranston So Powerful, Amazing Best Masterpiece in the History of Television Shows, I bet there will never, no show come even close to it.<br/><br/>I just Say Watch it, You will Remember me after Watching Last Episode. Look Guys it 2018 and want to watch this again and again! It truely is one of the beat shows of all times the writing, the acting, the directing are all top notch. Again, what are you waiting for?!? You will not regret! The only reason I gave it a nine is because of the character skyler..It's a nice serial not a movie .. 
but I hate the character skyler.. this is the type of woman who will kill u ... who thinks they always right .. even if they have done any terrible mistake and blame it because of u or the others.. I get irritated wen ever I see her .. she is the main reason who can get u killed in ur life ..
Hats off to the director who casted a character skyler and the actress looks the women who can do this .this is y lot of people get divorced ,, who can't give peace to their husband .. and more common in USA.. .. whom do u hate the most in breaking bad .. I just want to know wat people think ..
But the serial drama is awesome. U have to watch it ... and I also recommend u to see game of thrones if ur age is 18 +... Started off very strong in season 1 and 2! In series 3 it felt like more and more of the same concept. The story dragged along, and did not grab me anymore. In 2011 I watched the first 3 series in a row. I'd better give it a break after series 2. Should pick it up again at series 4... Will never get tired watching this series all over again!! Yeah b*tch!!:D This show is amazingly good, I started watching because everyone said it was amazing and I was not disappointed. The plot isn't over complicated but still manages to be very smart and rich. This is so addictive, but I recommend taking your time while watching as major actions in the plot are more satisfying. Meth, amazing acting, great script is the heart of breaking bad. This show is a masterpiece. One of the best TV shows... just brilliant. Like I mention before nothing will ever beat this masterpiece. This show started off really good. Was slow at times, especially seasons 2,3,4 and early into season 5. But the ending? Incredible. Amazing. Extraordinary. GENIOUS. So worth the wait. Thank you. Would give it a 9.7 but it didn't let me do that :( At first it is boring But be patient and see<br/><br/>Do not hurry. You will see the wonder I've watched the show twice now and am still in awe at what a masterpiece this show is. The first season may start off somewhat slow, however it only gets better and better from there. There is so much development in the show for every character that by the last episode you will almost be watching an entirely different show. I cannot think of a tv show I have ever been so shocked at the level of quality and talent showcased. And without spoiling anything, the series finale has to be the most satisfying episode of any television show ever. The ending was so well done I wouldn't want the show to end any other way. All I can say is godlike!<br/><br/>Breaking Bad is one of the best tv-show have I ever seen. And yeah the number one is Breaking Bad. Since 5 years any of the series can't change my mind on number one. There are so many elements that can make a show fail. Poor writing. Poor casting. Bad directing. I have never seen a show that conquers every facet necessary in molding an unforgettable series. The casting is impeccable. Creator Vince Gilligan put together an ensemble that features no A-list stars, just hungry, experienced thespians who give him 100 percent, including the brilliant Bryan Cranston, Anna Gunn as his wife, Dean Norris as Walter's intrepid, wise-cracking brother-in-law who happens to be a DEA agent, Bob Odenkirk as amoral attorney Saul Goodman, Aaron Paul as Walter's stoner sidekick, and Giancarlo Esposito as hiding-in-plain sight drug kingpin Gus Fring. The premise itself is plausible. A chemistry teacher finds out he has inoperable lung cancer and begins a new career creating methamphetamine with the help of one of his former students. The residual effects on the lives of both are profound. Every human experience is explored along the way. Love, greed, murder, betrayal, and, ultimately, fate. But what I like best about Breaking Bad are the nuances. Walter holds a drug dealer captive. When Walter brings him a sandwich, the dealer removes the edges of the bread. In a later episode, Walter begins to cut off the edges of his own sandwiches. The message: even your enemies can make a point. The show mixes tragedy, violence and even comedy as it tells the story of a mild-mannered man who has nothing to lose morphs into a monster. Breaking Bad is simply A-class television. Simply the best. 
Adrenalinic, ingenious and funny. This show has everything and mixes all the elements perfectly. Walter is one of the greatest created characters in the history. Best show ever period. This show is too good goddamn! Who loves Simply the best show ever made without a doubt.i would recommend to anyone who loves quality TV. Yeah, he's not a good guy, but he's definitely someone you want to win. Well first off, What the hell is there to say about Breaking Bad that hasn't already been said. Even though Better Call Saul is now in it's 4th season and is due to air at some stage this year, Breaking Bad is still very much at the forefront of AMC's hit list and hands down one the most addictive show I've ever seen in my life . <br/><br/>The first season starts off simple enough. Set in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Walter White, a high school chemistry teacher, discovers he has stage 3 lung cancer (despite being a non-smoker) and after discovering how much money can be made in the drug trade he teams up with Jesse Pinkman, a former student. It's there they begin manufacturing Methamphetamine as a way of financial security for Walt's pregnant wife and teenage son who has cerebral palsy.<br/><br/>Later on in the first season, Walt and Jesse get introduced to Tuco Salamanca, an extremely unpredictable and violent psychopath (played brilliantly by Raymond Cruz). Walt and Jesse sell the first batch of their product to Tuco and make their first fat stack of cash by doing so. The last scene of the first season really sets the standard for the rest of the series and gives you a solid idea of what's ahead.<br/><br/>I won't spoil anything for those of you that haven't had the chance to experience this masterpiece of a tv series yet, but the later seasons of Breaking Bad introduce more high profile figures of the underworld, shows A grade character development of the main cast of characters and shows the dire consequences and toll it takes on families who are caught up in the dark world of crime.<br/><br/>Of course, this series probably isn't for everybody, that's understandable considering it's content but Breaking Bad is hands down one of the best series ever made. The first time watching it, I couldn't believe how quick i got through the first season. It's just that kind of show. Brilliantly written. Brilliantly acted. Dangerously addictive, just like meth! <br/><br/>10/10 This is the most captivating, interesting, chilling series that has ever been created. It's almost a pitiful to watch it because once you do nothing ever comes close. If I could rate it a 20/10 I would a million times over. I love everything about this series from the location to every cast member and else thing else in between. Once a lifetime a series comes and leaves the audience in complete astonishment from start to finish! Breaking Bad is that series! The impeccable writing team lead by its creator Vince Giligan and the lead star Bryan Cranston who delivers one of the greatest, most convincing, and powerful performances in the history of Cinema, TV, and theater; engraving his mark on history! It's so well made, that you as an audience become a member of the cast, living with them and sharing their experiences! The things we do for family.... it really makes you think; how far would a desperate man go to save his family ! This is without a doubt the best TV drama I have ever seen. I have now watched this show three times, and I am sure I will watch it many more. The plot is the so incredibly interesting and entertaining, filled with characters so well constructed, and dialogue that can be heartbreaking but also darkly funny. I would recommend to everyone, but I would also recommend watching it again even if you've seen it. This is because, even though there are many dramatic and exhilarating moments throughout, it is quite something to look at this series as a whole and see how it all comes together in the end. It is so clever and so well thought out, which is missing in so many otherwise good series on tv today. The acting is so incredible. Aaron Paul gives an outstanding performance as Jesse, and enables you to sympathise with and love a character who usually you wouldn't. What is most amazing is the detail put into the growth and evolution of Walter White. It astounds me how you can initially feel sorry for and be worried for a character, but there are points later on in the show where you actually despise that same character. I haven't seen anything like it, and I doubt I ever will again! I know Game of Thrones is an awesome show, but there's no real-life drama that even comes close to B.B. Cinematography, direction, plot, acting has never been equaled. The last three episodes in particular, but really the entire show, is an amazing triumph of television viewing. I have a great life, & I still watch the last three episodes of this to get a charge! Unbelievable! "Feeling a little 'under the weather?' It must be the ricin that I put in that Stevia crap you put in your tea." Hahaha The show starts slow but keeps getting better every season, the story, acting and direction is so amazing that no episode in any season was a dull. The show keeps you hooked it is made for binge watching !! Couldn't believe it was better the second time I watched the entire series. <br/><br/>Amazing amazing television.<br/><br/>If you haven't watched you are so lucky. Get stuck in and enjoy. All time greatest series.<br/><br/>What an awesome change of pace for Bryan Cranston, who is best known for playing the goofy dimwitted Homer Simpson like dad from Malcom In The Middle(2000-2006). But this character is not goofy or dimwitted. Walter White is your everyday man, who is a high school chemistry teacher, and has a loving wife and handicapped son. On the verge of his 50th birthday party. He begins having a mid life crisis, to make matters worse, he is diagnosed with terminal cancer. But not wanting to leave his family with nothing, in a quick way to make a lot of money. He teams up with a former student named Pinkmam(Aaron Paul) who is now a drug dealer, to make the drug called Crystal Meth. You don't like what Walter is doing, but at the same time you try to understand why he is doing it. I like watching the transformation he is going through, like Mr.Chips turning into Michael Douglas from Falling Down(1993). This series is quite enjoyable, it's a good dramatic series, with some humor moments. Cranstons performance in the show is memorable, and at times heartbreaken to watch. And he and Aaron Paul play off each other so well. I hope it will last a little while. This is the best series ever made in every artistic aspect. Is THE masterpiece series. My friend recommended it. Actually I don't like violence but it's an exception. This show is absolutely a masterpiece to television. When I was fifteen I gave the first episode a try and after finishing it, I kept saying to myself "This is the show. This is the show. This is the show." I am sixteen now and I am still watching it again and again and again because of how much this show means to me. It has hands down the best acting I have ever witnessed, the writing is phenomenal, the character development, everything, everything, everything, everything. It is available on Netflix, so binge watch as much as you want. It was a real pleasure to watch this masterpiece !!! Thank you Vince Gilligan and all staff members !!! It's the second time I've written here, I've never been very good at it, but I couldn't leave this series behind, I had to come here to leave you my opinion. 
I feel that I have lived for almost a month in a world completely apart from what I was accustomed to, in the midst of wars, drugs, despair, between illnesses and always with my heart in my hands almost in every episode, was an whole other perspective of what surrounds me. But it was a good experience, the way the series captivates us, watching the growth of Jesse and the transformation of Walter, it was soo amazing to see!
Many people had recommended me to see this series and I've never seen much interest until finally coming here to IMDb and seeing the trailer and realizing that it was a very good series. I gave it to me to pass from a person who thought that it was more a series like the others to idolize both Walter and Jesse for being phenomenal personages.
I regret the fact that this series isn't rated best here because it deserves a 10. For all the good representation by the characters and the way it was edited and performed, what quality! This series will be one of those that will see and review and recommend to all who wanted to see something with excellent content and as well represented as Breaking Bad. 
So, I recommend you to see if you have not seen it, because you are missing one of the best things ever done in the world of cinema. For those who have seen it, enjoy it again, because it is worth it. Breaking Bad
 Breaking Bad is a virtuosos performance of a modern day crime drama. Set in Albuquerque New Mexico the show primarily follows the exploits and character development of the two main characters, Walter White played by Bryan Cranston and his streetwise sidekick Jesse Pinkman played by Aaron Paul. Initially seen in the pilot as a strait laced goody two shoes high school chemistry teacher, the titular character Walter White has his world turned upside down when he is diagnosed with terminal, inoperable lung cancer with chemo he is estimated to have a few years to live at most. 
After hearing about the money that could be made by selling meth and a meth lab walk through arranged through his step brother Hank Schrader, Faced with his impending mortality, and the dire financial straits his family will be without him, the primary breadwinner, Walter chooses to "break bad" a southern colloquialism to raise hell or turn to crime by making meth as a means of making money to leave his family.
Walter is a brilliant chemist, having contributed research that lead to a Nobel Prize so the life of a down trodden and underappreciated high school chemistry teacher was far below his credentials. To further the humiliation, in order to make ends meet for his family Walter was working a second job wiping down cars at a local car wash and many students jumped at this chance to mock him publicly. 
After tracking down Jesse, who he had seen at the scene of the meth lab and realized was going by the moniker "captain cook" he buys a campervan and cooks meth for the first time, Jesse awestruck as right off the bat Walter = has produced a potent and clean product "this is glass grade and some of these crystals are two, three inches long" he says denoting purity and the size of the meth chips. 
However, when Jesse goes to sell the meth to Crazy eight Molino he is accused of being a snitch by his previous partner Emilio who thinks Jesse knew the raid was coming rather than having coincidently escaped the raid though an extramarital affair with a presumably married woman a few doors down. In order to show his loyalty Jesse drives crazy eight and Emilio to the mobile meth lab where we left Walter. 
Walter is recognized by Emilio as having been there with the cops at the raid. At gunpoint Walter bargains for his life by offering to show how he cooked his high quality meth. A flicked cigarette butt accidently starts a bush fire, using this distraction Walter is able to start a chemical reaction producing deadly phosphine gas and trap both assailants in the camper van leading to their demise.<br/><br/>The pilot begins by showing the desolate landscape of rural New Mexico a harsh and unforgiving environment in which a panicked and nearly naked Walter is struggling at the wheel of his rapidly moving camper van. The gas mask shows danger, his lack of clothes portray a sense of vulnerability. We see him leave a tearful good bye message to his loved ones , pull out a gun and stand facing the approaching sirens, ready to shoot the first cop he sees, we see him put the gun in his own mouth. Clearly here is a man at the edge of sanity, overwhelmed by circumstances so far outside his normal that he is utterly lost and Bryan Cranston makes it believable. Then we cut to Walter in his bedroom at night, working out on a step master. The drastic disconnect between the panic and violence of the previous scene and this boring mundane normalcy leaves the audience with a burning question, "what happened to bring him to that point" it then fleshes out some of the family and family dynamics through a family breakfast. The wife is health conscious having them eat meat free bacon, the son is disabled and somewhat bitter. Walter is very accepting. Overall I greatly enjoyed Breaking Bad. I think it had amazing and believable acting. Compelling characters and excellent use of dramatic camera tricks. I would recommend Breaking Bad to my friends. I sat in my sofa watching Breaking bad every day, and i could not stop. This is one of the most breathtaking things I've ever seen in my entire life. The plot, writing, cinematography and dialogue is absolutely outstanding - And on another level from what i have watched before. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul fits into the role as Walter and Jesse perfectly.<br/><br/>So if you are reading through the reviews and are still unsure whether to watch this or not, I'm telling you - WATCH IT ASAP! The characters role play was marvelous, looks like real life acting. In the 20-30 minutes of 1st episode you will know what the tv series is all about.
Each and every episode was full of suspense and thriller. I can say it's better than game of thrones if you are a suspense lover. Must watch... AaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa Oh my God, this is just great. I never anticipated this series to be laugh out loud funny. The main characters are great, I take my hat off for Bryan Cranston portraying Walter Heisenberg. All the actors are just killing it. 
Walters character development is interesting to say the least. Meth cooking by your next door neurotic chemistry teacher...go figure. It´s hilarious. And it hits hard too.
I´m at the end of season 2. Ep 1-2 Season 2 isn´t that good, but I am very happy I gave it one more chance. I tell you, the best, you'll not regret watching it Extremely well played roles and a beautiful detailed production. A masterpiece. If you never watched breaking bad I wish I was you. One of the best emotional and realistic tv show ever Not as good as Game of Thrones, but it's pretty good. Pretty exemplary character development and just the right balance of comedy... actually I'm not sure about that. The comedic elements, albeit very very funny, are just not realistic so they take you out of the element of "being there" in the series, but other than that and some bad acting, especially the stereotypical typecast druggies, the series is pretty good. Definitely worth a watch. Well thought out TV series. Definitely a thumbs up!!! The best box set ever made! Watched it twice through and went into complete withdrawal post Breaking Bad, nothing to prepare you for this addiction, just jump straight in and enjoy! First I watched tons of great tv shows, comedy or drama and none had make me feel so many emotions I actually stopped thinking of it as just a show. The characters,camera action, brilliant ideas and mainly Script. The way conversations made me hear more, but in the same time turn off tv, so i dont have to feel that pain and angre...I actually stopped watching after something dead on the bed, wink wink. I started watch again in more than 6 months thinking that one moment that was the longest minute of my TV show expirience cant be out***** . Boy I was wrong and watched last 2 series in two days with look of another victim of that geniously written lines and all around perfection my nightmares see when they having a beutifull dream. The creator, writers, directors and actors have paid attention to every single detail, putting thought into every nuance in every character in every scene. Because of this attention to detail there is something for everyone in this show. Every thinking brain will immediately be attracted to the intelligence so evidently on display, that even if you're not a drug dealing chemist living in Albuquerque, you will find something in the characters that connects you to them and makes you hang on for dear life.<br/><br/>How the denial and desperation that can occur to the common working stand up citizen, the pillar of society that suddenly changes his moral standing in a society driven by the almighty dollar. This is pretty dam close to Fallen (Michel Douglas) but with up to date street smarts nd a lot more punch. <br/><br/>The characters don't over exaggerate their roles and the story line isn't filled with cleaver dialog or near to impossible feats of bravery or beating impossible odds. Just true to life screwed up events that could take place in the real world. I think they did their research on this one. Good work everyone. I love this movie
Change my mind
Change my life
Best movie forever Best series ever........ last season changed my life ...episode in Season 4 'the Fly'...then again a great 'read' and equally a 'show' by Cranston, which admittedly, I was not expecting. <br/><br/>Walter White has momentary moments of decency and accountability but, in the end, he's all about himself and his self-pitying on why he got screwed, regardless of his accepting what he negotiated from his fellow college classmates in their 'chemistry classes and their subsequent 'idea' on what their analysis of their discovery, is the genesis of his own depravity.<br/><br/>See this if only for the great ensemble of true talent from all assembled. The script writers have truly selected the right actors for each role. We don't have anyone acting in 'brown face' for Hispanics rather we have authentic portrayals by all. Mark Margolis is, once again, remarkable in this series as well as the prequel 'Better Call Saul'. In fact watch 'Better Call Saul' before you watch 'Breaking Bad' - it'll make a lot more sense.<br/><br/>Cranston, as 'Walter White', is excellent but thankfully he gets what he so justly deserves as does 'Jesse'.....watch the series and enjoy the ride. The brother-in-law 'Hank' is your typical 'white bread' hard ass cop but he is also someone who understands the reality of the 'barbarians' (Mexican drug cartels) at the gates. His finest hour is when he understands the corruption in El Paso of the federal DEA as the US officers mock him by using Spanish in his presence but he viscerally 'knows' their (US officers) socializing with known Mexican drug 'informants' is a indolent, compromised effort by US officials who are supposed to protect us from monsters rather than play golf with them.<br/><br/>A great and enobilling series of true commentary on the moral decline of our nation by the relativists who 'act' like the 'high priests' of 'Shinar' before God scattered all of them to the 4 winds of the earth. Bet 'Barakska' loved this series until that scene at the pool down in Mexico in Season 5....'Barakska' man de' koolest prez we evah had...lazy is my name and the smooth con is my game....just ask CNN huh fools? I have seen more than 2500 movies-series in my life, i have some favorites performances from great actors in classic movies.With breaking bad I had one of the greatest experience in my life with Bryan Cranston's Performance as Walter White, I can't forget how good he was in Breaking Bad, i cant erase many scenes from this series from my mind. This performance is definitely one of my 10 favorites and one of the best of all time.
i like to thank mr. Cranston because he is a great actor.<br/><br/>the series are really great, very good scenario and nice performance from the other actors
i like the direction and the photography<br/><br/>great character Devolopment
nice dialogs
very good plot This show had me completely glued to my screen,at work I couldn't think of anything other than get home and catch up on where i left,complete master piece. There is this episode about a fly, but still kept me thinking about that fly!!! Big up to this show I don't How any of you give Breaking Bad a score of anything less then 10 stars. That is insane. This is literally the greatest TV show of all time. It literally changed TV for the better. Someone explain to me how you rate Breaking Bad an 8 or a 9 or a 9.5 or anything less than a 10? What could have possibly been the difference from being a 10 and a 9 or 8.5? That is insane. This is literally the greatest TV show of all time. It literally changed TV for the better. Shows that came on after Breaking Bad ended compare themselves to Breaking Bad. THE GREATEST SHOW EVER. Best tv show,...worth watching every single moment First off...I do not write a reviews on many things. Only at a time at which I truly feel that compelled to do so will I take the time to write out a review. It was probably 2012 when I had first heard of this show just in passing...it was one of those "Man you need to watch this show" type of statement that someone told me. Of course people say these types of things all the time trying to sell other people on good shows to watch so I didn't think anything of it and continued on my merry way.<br/><br/>The day had finally come when I was searching tirelessly on Netflix for something to watch and by this time Netflix had just added the first 4 seasons of BB so I decided to actually sit and watch the pilot episode. Right away after hitting the play button on my remote the show snatched up my brain and grabbed a hold tightly...the creative genious that is Vince Gilligan really put together a picture perfect pilot episode which could really stand along as its own animal. The Cinematography is brilliant, the show's opening title sequence is picture perfect (Not too long, not too short and currently serves as my phone ring tone btw) and just over all feel of the show is very real in tone. You don't feel like you are watching a "tv show" but rather experiencing the lives of these people.<br/><br/>So after watching the pilot that was it...I couldn't pry myself away and I then binged the entire 4 seasons up to that point taking breaks only to sleep and eat...Everything about this show is perfect from the pacing, the character development, the acting and the creative attention to detail in the story telling...it is all so perfect and amazing to experience. Bryan Cranston has become my new favorite actor after watching this show...he is so relatable and everyone knows someone like Walter White in their life but he does an absolute amazing job in this role, it is no wonder why he has won so many awards.<br/><br/>What is great about this series and is something rarely seen is how it progressively gets better and better right up until the finale...there are no weak moments or weak episodes, everything has a point and purpose to the story telling and every episode gains momentum from the previous...its like a giant rolling snowball just waiting to hit something. The reason I am writing this now is because for the 3rd time I am re-watching the entire series simply because nothing is out there for me in the form of the same good entertainment I can find. I watched the series for the first time by myself, then I watched it again with my girlfriend a couple years ago, and the just last week I was bored one night going to sleep and thought what the hell I'll just watch the pilot episode again just to fall asleep to...Guess again, just like the previous 2 watches I got hooked again and was up til 3 am watching 4 episodes (That I had already seen 2 times) that is the effect this show has on people... it is as addictive to view as Heisenberg's baby blue Meth is to consume. I find myself with this stupid vindictive grin on my face when I finish watching these episodes even the 3rd time around...I catch new details never seen before.<br/><br/>In conclusion, if you have read this all the way to the end and are in the unfortunate group to have not watched this masterpiece of a show, please reconsider your time over the next couple of weeks and take a seat in front of the flat screen, pull up Netflix and enjoy what is probably going to go down as one of the greatest pieces of television in all history. Wow. I just watched through the whole series for the first time, and I never thought "beautiful" would be a word I use to describe a show about meth cooks. This show had me hating characters and loving characters simultaneously while also being marvelously shot. The dialogue was almost always great and even the weaker episodes were fantastic. This show is like The Office of dramas. Speaking of, "Felina" was only the second finale I shed a tear for, the other being The Office. This show is something that will live forever and will never lose its quality. Long live Heisenberg. Most outstanding: The writing! And that is all that needs to be stated. It never becomes boring, new twists coming non-stop and all the conflicts are maintaining suspense every episode and every minute.<br/><br/>The acting is in all regards outstanding. They embody well written characters that win the heart of everyone in the audience. There is such a vast verity of different personalities and every is interesting on its own.<br/><br/>When I watch this I almost feel captivated into the problems that the characters have. I feel their pain and feel how it is being tracked by the police and family at the same time.<br/><br/>Really interesting series with very complex plot and character development. This the one and only TV show that makes me nervous even reviewing it cause of my lack of ability to describe it properly. It's a show where almost every season, every episode is monumental. The pacing is somewhat slow at some point, but it is nothing to worry about. It is easily overshadowed by its epic moments throughout the entire series. This is a show that leaves me hanging, hangover, having that void of a feeling when it ends and it lasts for quite a long time. Vince Gilligan is a name that's hard for me to forget, and I often forget names. Easily one of my favorite shows of all time with a perfectly crafted ending.<br/><br/>The only show of all movies/shows I've ever given 10/10. Very good series. It is definitely worth your time. Very well done. Always keeps you on the edge of your seat. Didn't want it to end. Best show that was ever created and will ever be created! My favorite show of all time. Brian Cranston is amazing, to show the rise and fall of a man entering the meth trade could not be done better. Although I've never watched an episode of GOT, I believe Breaking Bad is the best dark dramedy ever put on television. If the vastly underrated pilot episode doesn't hook you, then I don't know what will. Breaking Bad is almost too good to describe. I think I was never in my Life so hooked from a TV Show like i was into Breaking Bad. The Writing, The Acting, The Direction, The Storyline is just stunningly Perfect. In my Opinion it can´t get any better than this in Drama TV, so you definetely should check this out if you haven´t already. The writers created a tribute to high dostoevskian dark comic buffoonery, set in ABQ New Mexico...brilliant. The clarity of Walter's blue meth is the writers winking at you as if to say, do yourself a favor and re-read a few pages of Crime and Punishment while watching this one... Breaking Bad is like Crystal Meth, you'll get addicted... The "chemistry" between the teacher and his student, the two parters, two friends, a father son like relationship and enemies of each other... These two are the highlights of the show... The Last Fifth Season is the Ultimate season... Its the best finale season of all time of any show... Watch the Series... It will be an experience... I watched so many different tv series. by far this was the best ever in my life. thanks for the producer and actors If anybody watching this series i m telling you this is the best series when i start this series i watched around 10 episodes in one day believe me this is really cool "yeah mr. white yeah science". Perfect? Nah, but what ever is? Nothing. Nothing stands up to constant scrutiny, but this show was and still is quite an exhilarating journey in character development. This should have closed the book on pop culture's infatuation with exploring toxic masculinity and moral ambiguity-at based on these specific demographics, but yeah, TV AND Hollywood runs on reboots and regurgitation. Do I subscribe to all of the shows' theses about morality? I dunno. It's too incredibly well acted and engaging for those issues to take me out of the universe they've created, and it's a place you can revisit time and time again. Very, very few shows have ever pulled this off, so, kudos. Mr Lambert AKA Heisenberg AKA Walter White commits his greatest crime at the very end of season 5 episode 15 when it revealed that he did not finish drinking his Dimple Pinch. It was my first ever series I watched and I didn't excepted to be so perfect.Everything is perfect in this series starting from directing,actors,story,characters.Bryan Cranston in leading role was just legend,he build up his role so good with the help of Aaron Paul making a duo of actors you just cant stop watching.I highly recommend this series you will enjoy them 100% <br/><br/>PS: I already watched it twice... The episodes get more and more interesting. Bryan Cranston plays Walt, a high school Chemistry teacher that starts manufacturing crystal meth. He needs the money for his family, because he is dying of cancer. Complications arise with production. Complications arise with distribution. Complications arise with collecting. Complications just arise.<br/><br/>It is a lesson in starting, running and failing at business. Things get better; things get worse. Walt is a regular Jeckyl and Mr Hyde. He tries to portray himself as a person of quiet demeanor but quickly turns into a monster (without taking drugs) turning rabid on his slacky partner.<br/><br/>Family involvement is a distraction except for his brother-in-law being with the DEA. It is similar to "Weeds" but not as good. This is the best storytelling of all time. hands down. the writers of this series put on a clinic on how to tell a story. <br/><br/>i understand that there is a mystery as to what good storytelling actually is. but the bottom line is this: a story must be rich with irony. this is what makes breaking bad so good. a high school chemistry teacher cooking meth. after getting diagnosed with cancer, he pursues this goal to provide for his family after he dies. meanwhile, his brother-in-law is a DEA agent who pursues drug traffickers such as himself. all of this is extremely ironic and it plays across the whole series.<br/><br/>i've never seen such good storytelling from any other TV series. some movies come close. but nothing really touches the scope of breaking bad. the character arc of walter white. watching him transform from a meek man to a murderous, vengeful drug kingpin is fascinating. jesse pinkman is also a revelation. he is the most tragic character in this story. his inner conflict is heartbreaking. <br/><br/>nothing comes close to this TV series. the sopranos is a joke compared to breaking bad. with time, TV and film historians will look back and agree that breaking bad is the best television series to ever be made. that's guaranteed. walter white is the best protagonist to be ever portrayed on the big screen. other television series like Lost, The Sopranos, The Wire, Mad Men, and others have shown flashes of brilliance .. they've even had many seasons in a row that were brilliant. however, they fell apart at one point or another. Lost really dropped the ball at the end of their series. however, breaking bad maintains an incredible quality throughout. the ending is like no other. ironic. palpable. captivating. one of my favorite episodes is the 2nd to last episode of the series. i'll never forget the closing scene of the 2nd to last episode. <br/><br/>just wow. 2 words into the review and I didn't know what to say, I am really astonished by this series. It has everything, great actors, brilliant plot, the idea in itself was so simple yet created such epitome of perfection. 5 Seasons, they are, but you won't feel it, you will get addicted to it. <br/><br/>Breaking Bad is simply a phenomenon that won't re-occur, because in its ingenuity, it is so unique. It's so genius, comedic when necessary. There is Action, Drama, Humor, Joy, Melancholy, plot-twists, cliff-hangers and everything.<br/><br/>It feels so unfaked, the way it's all set up, it feels like a real story, no place for supernatural events. You will see yourself as part of the series.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad cannot be judged by one or two episodes, it's a puzzle of 62 episodes, won't unravel 'til gathered.<br/><br/>I recommend this to everyone, and I mean, everyone.<br/><br/>10/10 Started really slow, but then evolved to be one of the best TV shows ever made. I felt that the most powerful acting was done by Jesse Pinkman. His dialogues like," Hey, Yo! Mister White" and "Bitch!" will forever be etched in my mind. His relationship with Heisenberg, how he always felt that he was being used, like he was just a pawn, a means to an end is reinforced throughout the series, and when he finally gets out, the feeling is of liberation, in part quite literally. The relationship between the two is the high point of the series, how Walter considers him to be his son and goes to great lengths to protect him, time and again. His portrayal of transformation of a teacher to a drug lord is praiseworthy. As the series progressed his motivations are shown to change which is true for most people and hence is a very relatable character. The acting of his wife is also good, however I feel that time and again, she was shown in the wrong light. The series is made great by the acting of these three. Honorable mentions include Gus. The plot develops in such a way that the stakes increase every time. However, by the end of the season four you have a fairly good idea about what comes next. Even then the events play out in such a way that they keep you at the edge of your seat. Definitely one for the books, the highlights being the incredible acting and the relationship between Walter White and Jesse Pinkman. People who love reality should go for this show. It starts slow but it does not lose a grip anywhere. Last season is mind blowing u will find some sensible conversation and sensible spin off. Storyline is so good the best thing about this series is direction is at its best. The way they describe everything without any dialog feels awesome while watching it. If u think like a common man u also can predict the show while seeing it. So best of luck and go for it This is a powerful and evocative story of resentment, ambition, greed, and despair.<br/><br/>I have little more to say on this show that has been so well-reviewed in so many places over the past several years. It is the rare combination of being both an ambitious and artistically successful story and also an entertaining adventure that pulls no punches.<br/><br/>Both mundane and terrifying, "Breaking Bad" is the triumphant icon of our golden age of television. <br/><br/>Enjoy it. I know I have.<br/><br/>(I have seen this many times, most recently binging it in September 2017) I wish I could get more specific with review scores because this show is not a perfect 10 but it's more than a 9 I would say it's about a 9,5 or a 9,6. Now I wouldn't say I'm an expert on TV but so far this is the best show I have seen. The story is fantastic, the dialogue is amazing and it's funny in the darkest f*cking way possible. I always remember this one scene when Walter is making dinner after Skyler kicked him out and Skyler does not give a sh*t at this point and she goes: "I f*cked Ted" and Walter's smile just disappears and Sky walks off and it was the funniest f*cking thing. The finale of season 2 was annoying. That entire season was building up to this big thing and then BOOM! two fuggin planes crash into each other! Great! Look you can't just skip it but the ending's not great. If you were turned off by it don't worry it gets better, like way way way better. Please watch this show preferably on a streaming service and if you don't have access to a service that has it buy it on DVD/Blu-ray trust me it's worth it When i saw the first 3 episodes i wasn't really thrilled by this...As i went on seeing this it got more interesting..,and at the end of 2nd season i was blown away by the story,twists and turns. So hang in there for first few episodes after that you cant stop yourself from watching this. And for those who think breaking bad is boring guys seriously there's something wrong with you. Breaking Bad could have gone down in history as one of the greatest television shows ever if it had ended on a high note.The logical place to end it was at the end of the fourth season when Walt killed Gus Fring.Not only was it the greatest on screen death ever, they couldn't possibly ever create a more realistic and terrifying bad guy.The next season was spent trying to tie up all the loose ends and it was very unbelievable.Even worse, they decided to insult your intelligence by cutting the season in half and making it two seasons.That's a bitch move.They knew they had jumped the shark but they weren't done taking your money.So they forced a last season on us and it had a lame story and disappointing end.They went with the old tactic of bringing in Nazis to make the real bad guys look good.A last ditch attempt to win over anyone who thought Walt or Jesse weren't great people.All they succeeded at was ruining a great TV show.One good thing is that I never saw that end coming, because it was stupid.I'd recommend this show to everyone, just stop after the fourth season. best acting best scenes best episodes in TV series history Brayn Cranston in this TV show has excellent acting and Aaron Paul too for me this is best show ever to me and lot of people said like me and we all know this is the best show ever i want thank Sony and Amc for this show its really a good show for all people who want watch better real acting just breaking bad its best one Best TV series that I had ever watched. Most of series lost it's momentum after 2 or 3 season, but the essence of this show is that every season it you are more in it. Throughout the show, you are facing bittersweet feeling towards the main lead. After watching season 1 you think it is overrated (imdb-9.5),but seriously hook up for season 2 and after that you regret why there are only 5 seasons. This series gives you a roller-coaster of emotions.Without giving spoilers, just watch the show how beautifully they execute each minute details and excellent writing. Im Stunned with this show so much so i kept thinking of the event a lot of time after i have watched it on Netflix,so much so that I ran three or four episodes at on session. I admired and sympathized with Bryan Cranston to the very end for his genius and loyalty to Aaron Paul in the last episode,(both are the major players),for pegging and offering the 80 million dollars to the gang and save the DEA agent Dean Norris(Hank Shrader,his relative) ,almost cried for seeing the moments of death of the beautiful Krysten Ritter(Jane Margolis) so young because of overdose.62 episodes of criminal drama leads viewers to believe that crime in general and drug business is really futile. I would love to see RJ Mitte in real life because he perfected his role as a teenager with cerebral palsy . In short this is a real work of art. This series makes every chemistry teacher look cool. The premise is refreshing and brilliant. The writing stellar.<br/><br/>It walks us through the painfully ordinary life of Walter White and shows us what happens when faced with his own impending mortality.<br/><br/>I'm now viewing the series with fresh eyes after a second run through of all six seasons and it still measures up as one of the best written series of our millennium.<br/><br/>During my first viewing, some of the plot lines seemed a stretch to me but I realized after a second viewing; we're actually watching a super villain in the making.<br/><br/>Whatever minor fault we may find from episode to episode, on the whole Breaking Bad shows us there are no hard lines between the good or the bad. Only our choices that lead us down horribly wrong paths or horribly right paths.<br/><br/>I also think Anna Gunn should be extremely proud of her portrayal of Skyler White. She played a modern day Lady Macbeth with such artistic angst, viewers passionately despised her character. No easy task so kudos to her.<br/><br/>Much of the credit for the series success must go to the stellar acting of each supporting character yet at the end of the day we must also acknowledge the brilliance of Brian Cranston. He played Walter White to perfection. Through all his character's fallibility we find him to be ineptly human just like us. <br/><br/>While there are no redeeming characters in the show, the series prompts deep emotional responses from the viewers.<br/><br/>We get lost in the story and come out the back end wondering why we didn't pay more attention in chemistry class. Breaking Bad is one of the best TV series I have watched. I started enjoying the show from it's first episode and enjoyed till the end of it.<br/><br/>It's about drug, about family, about friendship, violence, trade, business, investigation, law and risks and luck. White and Pinkman as partners, is a perfect casting. Hank's satirical and comedy punches are also equally interesting.<br/><br/>Curiosity is always at its peak. I not just felt for the protagonists, but also for wide number of characters. In short, I developed sound rapport with most characters during my watch.<br/><br/>If you are in dilemma, you shouldn't. You will love it, trust me! This is the best show i've ever seen and I don't think I will ever watch something this good on television again.<br/><br/>The cast is absolutely outstanding, not a single weak performance,they were all perfect: Bryan Cranston gives one of the best performances of all time and the same thing goes for Aaron Paul. The rest of the cast is excellent as well, with the best performances coming from Anna Gunn, Giancarlo Esposito, Jonathan Banks, Dean Norris, Bob Odenkirk... hell even Jesse Plemons.<br/><br/>Walter is (and by far) the best character of TV history and his evolution an relationship with Jesse are two most interesting and addictive things ever. There's not a lot of comedy but when the show wants to be funny is HILARIOUS.<br/><br/>The directing is stunning; every episode is a visual masterpiece and some directors (not only from TV) could learn something out of this).<br/><br/>The original soundtrack is beautiful and incredibly intense (Crawl Space) and the non original songs made this one of my favorite soundtracks of all time.<br/><br/>Each season is better than the last one, look my at 10/10 rating for the episodes on each season:<br/><br/>.S1: Pilot .S2: Phoenix, ABQ .S3: Fly, Half Measures, Full Measure S4.: Crawl Space, End Times, Face Off S5: Live Free or Die, Say My Name, Confessions, Ozymandias, Granite State, Felina<br/><br/>Perfect writing, perfect acting, perfect direction and soundtrack... go watch the show. I love media and entertainment. Movies and video games tend to be my favorite but one form of media I don't really like nowadays is television. I used to love TV series as a child but growing up I've lost a lot of interest. Despite this I actually thoroughly enjoyed one show, and that show was Breaking Bad. I've always heard about this show from everyone saying how awesome it was, but I never really had any interest until I saw my uncle watching it. I was hooked on just one episode. <br/><br/>The series is all about a chemistry teacher named Walter White who is diagnosed with lung cancer. His future looks bleak but he decides to get treatment for the cancer anyways which would be expensive and probably put his family into debt, so he decides to do something crazy just to support his family. He had two jobs already but being a teacher and car wash worker alone could not do the job. He teams up with the second main character, Jesse Pinkman to synthesize and market methamphetamine. This point is where the series takes off and gets much more interesting. Walter White and Jesse Pinkman turn from zeroes into successful and rich drug lords. <br/><br/>Everything about this show was just fantastic. My favorite aspect of the entire show though had to be the characters. All of the characters, even the minor ones were three dimensional and exciting. I loved this show so much that I even liked to see the characters I didn't like, because they still added something amazing to the story. There was also loads of character development and even character derailment. All of the characters' relationships and interactions made sense and tied together. The main character Walter White, who turned into a monster, I still supported because he was just so well written that I couldn't help but love him no matter what he did. If anyone wants a show with great characters they would really like this show. <br/><br/>Another aspect about this show I like is the theme and dark tone. This show was intended for mature audiences and nothing about this show was sparkly or innocent. I love morbid TV series and everything about this show was morbid. I was on the edge of my seat every episode. It was almost as if I could feel all the suspense and nervousness the characters felt. Usually it's very difficult to pull off dark themes, but Breaking Bad did it with perfection. I do admit though that the first couple of episodes were really hard to watch but it turned out to be worthwhile. Let's just say the whole thing about drugs, murder, sex, families being torn apart, and etc. was pulled off marvelously. <br/><br/>This show just had everything. Although my favorite parts of this show were the characters and tone, I still liked everything else such as the plot, music, visuals, and writing. I don't think I'll find another show that can hook me like this one. If you couldn't already tell I highly recommend this show to all adult viewers who like something edgy. If you don't really like edgy shows try this anyways because it's just that good. well where do i begin , this show is not just another television show its the most awesome thing a person could ever encounter . its fiction everyone knows that but still its like the most real thing i've ever seen. the acting , the story , the direction , the dialogs ,everything is out of this world . And at top of all these things Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul had portrayed there characters fantastically . i mean i can't imagine anyone else to act the way these two did. Its the thing that is gonna be remembered for centuries. i don't know about any of you people but this show has made a major impact in my life .And for those who like watching TV series haven't seen this one are missing the best experience of TV. It may have been an overrated TV series, but it's overrated for a reason. It's just that good for what you can watch on Basic Cable at the time. Each episode of Breaking Bad is filled with great dialogue, character development, intriguing plot lines, and sprinkles of humor here and there. It's jam-packed with content on expert story telling.<br/><br/>The story of Breaking Bad follows Walter White (Bryan Cranston), an overqualified Chemistry teacher at a high school at a part-time car wash worker in Albuquerque, New Mexico. After being diagnosed with lung cancer, he uses his chemistry knowledge to manufacture methamphetamine by partnering up with former student, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul). Right here is where the fun of the show us. We watch episode after episode of a highly educated man with a kid who only knows street smarts interact with each other and develop a bond while struggling with their lives. It's a complex relationship that the two characters but you will totally get invested in it.<br/><br/>Other points I would like to make is that there is a good amount of scientific accuracy in Breaking Bad to the point where you might get a little educated watching this. This is also one huge character study regarding Walter White. We see an under-appreciated man become someone huge and that causes a building of a huge ego that will eventually wreck havoc. In fact, think of Walter White as a sociopath in the making. A law-abiding citizen becoming the biggest and smartest criminal you could imagine. Show Creator Vince Gilligan said that this show is about "the protagonist becoming the antagonist".<br/><br/>You get five whole seasons of amazing storytelling if you watch this. It is impossible to think of every adjective to describe the epic story that is Breaking Bad. The show from beginning to end is probably one of the most incredible rides in the history of television. <br/><br/>This series doesn't just dive into the drug trade and the criminal underworld that cooking crystal meth delivers, this show also dives into the lives of each character and makes you see the moral complexity of each and every character in the show. <br/><br/>So why is it that I also said it is one of the worst series of all time too? Well it's pretty simple really. Once you see this show from beginning to end, you will be amazed... better yet so astounded, that you may not be able to watch ANY other show on TV because of it. No matter what you do, or what you say to yourself, you will almost always compare every other TV show to Breaking Bad and find that you will not find anything as incredible as this show is. The show is that amazing. I only watch Game of Thrones, True Detective, and Sons of Anarchy now because of it, and they still pale in comparison to this show.<br/><br/>And in fact, upon another binge worthy viewing of the show, it may actually be better the 2nd time around since you can actually see the changes that each person goes through without wondering what will happen next. I keep saying it to anyone that I'm friends with and others as well, you are doing yourself a disservice by not watching this amazing piece of art that truly will stand the test of time. Breaking Bad is one of the best TV shows to ever air in history. Now for me, this is the best TV show I have ever seen. Just seeing this guy go from being all nerdy and timid to this tough and self absorbed man is truly incredible. I have to give it up for Bryan Cranston. He is one of the best actors living right now. He was born to act. I mean his face just has so much emotion in it. Most actors have to try and get the right facial expressions to play that character right. But Bryan's face can make a wide range of expressions without even having to do much. And oh my goodness... Aaron Paul... When I first saw this show, he didn't seem like such a good actor. To me at least he didn't. But as the show goes on, his acting becomes phenomenal! Like when he gets mad in the show, it makes you think that he's in full rage in real life. It's truly amazing. Everyone did an amazing job on Breaking Bad. Every single character in the entire show was incredible. Breaking Bad is the gold standard of television. The Sorpranos broke ground for many of these "follow on" series. The Sorpranos were East Coast gangsters Breaking Bad, Western gangsters but still both stories were captivating in there own way. I've seen every episode of both of these series and I vote Breaking Bad a winner by a nose. Perhaps its because Breaking Bad had little nudity, sex and graphic swearing. HBO did Sopranos and A&E did Breaking Bad which is likely the reason in the differences in sex, etc. HBO has also done the Game of Thrones and its very similar in sex, etc. etc. to Sopranos but still GOT is an excellent series and well worth watching. I'm only halfway through the second season of GOT but have liked it so much I've done a review of it and gave it a 9. To sum up this review Breaking Bad is a very well written, directed. acted and shot series. I will admit when I was first introduced to this show I did not think I could get into it but when you give it a shot and watch through the whole first 3 episodes your hooked onwards to see the roller coaster ride that unfolds for Mr. Walter White. Many times throughout the show you "think" you know what's about to happen but things take a split second turn. I was satisfied with the ending but would have been more stoked to see how one other character that drives away ended up. I wont give away who it is but it would have been gratifying to see how his life turned out since we saw how his partner ended up. Or at least have seen what was next for him. Either way the best show I have seen in my life. It's basically an extremely long movie thats about the best way to put it. i finished watching this TV show a while back but my profile checklist says i still have to write a review, and what better way to do that by reviewing Breaking Bad, since Aaron Paul and Bryan Cranston are in my icon? Well guys, Breaking Bad is simply amazing and my life will probably be a downhill from now on cause what am i supposed to watch now, Breaking Bad is over, what is the point of living am i right, ha ha ha..ah..h.. Aaron Paul and Bryan Cranston are such perfect actors, they could probably manage to sell me anything cause i'd buy everything from them, and in this TV show they're really over the top. The plot is already genius, but mostly the way it's build is what makes it absolutely special. I know a lot of people complained/will complain about how slow it is, but the truth is that THAT is its biggest asset. Things that might seem useless and boring, like for example constantly seeing Walter and his family having breakfast and talking about common stuff, makes you indirectly perceive the characters as normal human beings, maybe even part of your own family. So when the tense things happen they're even more shocking, cause they gave you this comforting chill zone to settle in and then they take it away from you. This is how i see it at least. Therefore PLEASE don't drop it if you get bored because i swear, it's its slow building that makes the adrenaline scenes be as powerful as they are. Okay last things: 1) the characters are all perfection. i can't honestly think of one character that's been terrible or pointless, they're all important and great in some sort; and i seriously don't understand at all how is it possible that so many people dislike Skyler White, when she's one of the greatest wife/mother figures on screen you could ever possibly see, but well that's my opinion i guess; 2) the finale episode is extremely simple and yet a series finale that is imprinted in my brain and i just loved it to death; 3) Simply, watch it, man. Breaking Bad was and still is the best TV Show and I just love it. I might be a guy who really doesn't care about shows that get talked about a lot. So when I was recommended the show I was like OK fine. The pilot episode got hooked I'm in. I wanted to see where these characters go; I wanted to see the ideas and plot twist and turns. The show is just so good, by the end of the show in season 5 episode 15 I'm really happy. <br/><br/>OK... I think you know what I think of this show it is just so good. I want to explain what makes this show so great. Walter White is the best portages of the show he goes through a transformation into a villain. Brain Cranston is one of the best actors in the show if the best. Jesse Pinkmen is a great character; he was broken by the end. He changed massively and for the entertainment of us. This show featured some of TV's greatest villains like Taco, the twins, Uncle Jack and of course Gustavo Fring. Hank is a great character too; he fits the cop kind of character.<br/><br/>This Show was also trying to teach us something about the drug life. If you become a Meth dealer you could lose your family, friends and your life. I believe that we must realize that drug dealing is wrong.<br/><br/>The dialog really is great with some emotional, depth and humor. I'm never bored by the dialog scenes because it's needed for the rest of the story. <br/><br/>This show is a drama and it's thick, Even though it has it funny moments. Every season is darker then the last and that's why the 5th season was that depressing. Sometime Walter White does things which make you go he wouldn't do that in season 1. Oh yeah... Skyler is bitch.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Breaking Bad is a masterpiece and it will be remembered. So hail to the king. And thank you ever much for reading, Goodbye. Breaking Bad is one of the best series I have ever watched. I think characters and fictions are selected masterly. The series let some question marks in mind. Actors make their duties well ( even Skyler ._. ).<br/><br/>Leading Roles :<br/><br/>Walter White ( Bryan Cranston ) : His a chemistry teacher. He is Skyler's husband and father of Walter Jr. He learns his illness and then enters drug jobs to earn more much money with his student.<br/><br/>Skyler White ( Anna Gunn ) : She is Walter's wife. I think she is very irritating. Mother of Walter Jr.<br/><br/>Walter JR ( RJ Mitte ) : He is Skyler and Walter's son. He is a disabled.<br/><br/>Jesse Pinkman ( Aaron Paul ) : He is the most lazy student of Walter White. He sells drugs with his two friends. <br/><br/>Hank ( Dean Norris ) : He is Walter's wife's sister's husband. He is a police man.<br/><br/>Marie ( Betsy Brandt ) : She is Hank's wife and Skyler's sister.<br/><br/>Saul Goodman ( Bob Odenkirk ) : He is a lawyer. <br/><br/>Gustavo Fring ( Giancarlo Esposito ) : He is a famous drug seller.<br/><br/>Mike ( Jonathan Banks ) : He is a Gustavao Fring's partner. He is a killer. I am going to miss watching this series, yo!<br/><br/>I just finished binge watching all five seasons of Breaking Bad over the past two or so weeks. I knew from the beginning that once I reached the finale the entirety would be superb. I was right. And it just had to be because when I started this "greatest show of all time," as some describe it, I only mildly liked it.<br/><br/>Yet, I was intrigued and had a continual fascination with my/our obsession with anti-heroes, or in some cases, flat out villains. Why do I/we want so badly for them to get away with it? Especially when said "anti-hero/villain" is such an incredible asshole?<br/><br/>I am uncertain as I know I would want this person stopped in real life.<br/><br/>Other than the obsession I had with the lead baddie, I loved something even more about Breaking Bad: 92% pure unpredictability. Almost every single time, in 62 episodes, but *maybe* 2-3 times, I guessed wrong on how that scene or storyline would play out. It helped our asshole characters (yeah, there are definitely more than one) were incredibly human and therefore, continuously made horrible and big mistakes.<br/><br/>I knew this was fiction, but almost each time a huge decision had to be made or something significant had to be said, I wanted them to go this direction and when they, far too often, went the opposite way, I was dumbfounded and frustrated. But, that made this extremely well written.<br/><br/>These characters all became real in this fictional tale and they all did act like true human beings. If me, a non-user and my non-user drug friends were to become dealers and then worse, this is probably how it would play out. Or a lot worse. You see, these guys, or mainly the wonderful lead, Bryan Cranston's Walter White, were extremely lucky at times. Make that many times.<br/><br/>Like I said, I took the better part of two weeks to make it through the six years of this series. I loved a ton of the shockers, most of which were toward the second half of both season four and five. Also, I loved how dark and realistic this got towards the inevitable ending. And I will now miss the characters I grew to truly like and admire, such as: Walt, Mike, (Better Call) Saul, (only because he was cute) Badger and Gus.<br/><br/>No – not Jesse, yo! He was a little bitch! And for the most part, annoying as all Hades.<br/><br/>Take my advice and do as I had. I hadn't announced on social media and only to 1-2 select friends in person, that I was watching this. I wanted to avoid every single possible spoiler and over the years, I saw nothing but spoilers all over Facebook, Twitter, etc. Now, back when the show was on, I had never actually planned on taking on the series in my already overloaded TV watch list, so I either ignored the spoiler posts, didn't understand them or didn't care to read them to put to memory. So, I went in and stayed completely clean throughout the entire series.<br/><br/>And nowI am ready to share my viewing of the complete series of Breaking Bad with all my friends, watch the countless YouTube videos and open the door to the discussions and questions I need answers to. I registered with IMDb just so I could write this review. I am almost finished with Season 5, and I think this may well be the best TV drama of all time. I got onto the bandwagon late, and already knew how it ended when I started watching the show, but that was basically all I knew. I cannot express in words how amazing this show is. There are so many amazingly interesting characters/performances, but I have to say that Esposito as Gus Fring is unbelievably great as a villain, and Bryan Cranston is sublimely flawed and interesting as White. The relationship between White and Pinkman makes the show, and the decision not to kill off Pinkman in the first season is THE thing that turned this show into a phenomenon. Whoever made that decision, I assume Gilligan, turned an interesting and great TV show into an all-time great TV show. "I am the one who knocks" and "I won" are two of the greatest TV-drama lines of all time. <br/><br/>Minor Quibbles: So far, Idon't think season 5 is as good as the others. I don't really buy that Beneke would just not say anything after what happens with Skyler's guys. <br/><br/>I know how it ends, I don't think season 5 is quite at the level of the others (so far) and I still cannot wait to finish the series. You are diagnosed with terminal cancer, fully aware that what time you have left is slowly ticking by. With this tragic scenario upon you, how would you choose to spend what time you have left?<br/><br/>In the world of television you could perhaps choose the Hayley Cropper route, living your remaining days on the cobbles of Coronation Street, surrounded by Norris, Rita and Deirdre. Spending the high percentage of time you have left working at the local knicker factory and spreading butter on Roy's buns.<br/><br/>Or you could choose the route of a down on their luck chemistry teacher, deciding that what time remains is better spent using those chemistry skills, making sure your family are financially secure by cooking and dealing crystal meth, leading the way to becoming a millionaire drug king pin.<br/><br/>By the latter, I am of course referring to Walter White, the iconic anit- hero of AMCs outstanding TV series Breaking Bad. <br/><br/>Breaking Bad follows the story of over qualified chemistry teacher Walter White, a down on his luck family man who also works part-time in a car wash establishment to provide for those he loves most. When Walter is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, he makes plans to ensure his wife Skyler, son Walter Jnr and soon to be born daughter are to be financially secure after his death. <br/><br/>However, we are not talking about your usual pension plan or life assurance, Walter has a far bigger contingency plan. He decides the best way forward in providing financial security and payment for his chemotherapy treatment is to come up with a business venture. Now this sort of business strategy is not one that requires a visit to the bank in anticipation your business loan is successfully approved. Instead Walter decides that he should use his exceptional skills as a chemist and team up with ex-school pupil and small time drug dealer Jesse Pinkman. The most unlikely of business partnerships is then formed as the pair produce and manufacture (cook) crystal meth, enabling them to sell their product on the streets.<br/><br/>From season 1 through to the concluding final season, viewers around the globe have been glued to their TV screens as they witness Walter and Jesse go from small time dealers to then produce the finest, most wanted product in the market.<br/><br/>Of course this all comes at a price, as success leads to egos and greed and a foray of catastrophic events change both Walter and Jesse's lives forever. <br/><br/>The path of both characters is intriguing to watch and their change in personalities become apparent. Especially in the case of Walter as he tries to hide his secret life from his family, which is even tougher when your own brother-in-law is the investigating DEA agent trying to bring down the infamous drug lord Heisenberg (AKA Walter White).<br/><br/>As the story unfolds you see how a family man with ethics and principles can completely change, lies and deceit become a natural trait for Walter who stops at nothing to get what he wants. Unfortunately for him this leads to relationships with his family and Jesse to become beyond repair.<br/><br/>What makes Breaking Bad stand out from other shows is that from the outset each season provides a story and plot that just gets better and better. Breaking Bad goes the distance without lapsing and concludes with an adrenalin hitting impact on the viewer, this is the power behind Breaking Bad.<br/><br/>The show is unlike any other before, it does not lose momentum, there is not the disappointment of its eventual ending, this is because the story concludes at its peak, it finishes at the top. <br/><br/>The credit for this has to go to creator Vince Gilligan on knowing when to conclude the story and for creating the character of Walter White. His creation is sure to lead Walter White in becoming a cult icon in the same league as a Tony Montana, a Michael Corleone or a Tony Soprano. This of course would not have been possible without the superb portrayal by Bryan Cranston, who along with Aaron Paul's Jesse Pinkman provide phenomenal performances throughout the show.<br/><br/>High praise must go to all behind the show, cast and crew. All involved are responsible for making arguably the finest TV show of our generation. Maybe I should reconsider that statement, as Breaking Bad as a complete package has to go down as one of the greatest TV show ever made. This series is the best i've ever seen. I watched many series like walking dead,game of thrones,sopranos,the wire but Breaking Bad is the Number one.<br/><br/>The funny thing about Breaking Bad is that when you urge people to watch it, and describe the basic idea of the show, they think it all sounds a bit ridiculous. Well, hands up, so did we when it was explained to us. To anyone out there who has these doubts - put them from your mind! This is, without doubt one of the finest pieces of drama ever made. There is not a weak performance from any of the actors, and the consistent quality of the storyline is maintained through all 5 series. I would go as far as to say that Bryan Cranston's portrayal of Walter White (mild-mannered chemistry teacher gone bad) is bordering on genius.<br/><br/>The first and second season was a kind of boring(in action), but there are so many good conversations. And the actors are so good. I really loved the show and i was really surprised at the end. Watch out for spoilers in the internet, there many dump people..<br/><br/>Watch my Top 20 series list: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls058488063/ . . . . mfg M You're literally on the edge of your seat throughout the ENTIRE 5 seasons. I watched the whole series in just 3 weeks because it was so addictive. The whole thing is very interesting. Have you ever heard of a story like this before assuming you've read what it is about. A normal boring middle-aged high school teacher who breaks bad into crazy chemical genius? It gets harder and harder to sympathize with Walt as the series continues but you just can't help but like Walt?!?!? I think it's the thrill of watching it and thinking what if I could do it because we relate with the character in so many ways yet we would never do it. JESSE PINKMAN, thank the lord Vince didn't kill him off because just watch and see Aaron Paul's phenomenal acting. <br/><br/>Overall, wow. just wow. The entire series is just a piece of television greatness and I'm sure it will be up in the likes of the twilight zone in many years to come.<br/><br/>It will be the best TV show you have ever watched. First off I have never been one to describe anything as perfect in the past. Every girl, show, movie, book, etc. I can always find a flaw with anything especially TV shows and movies other people think are amazing. But I must admit breaking bad is the most amazing TV show; from the acting, plot, writing, directing, and cinematography it is dare I say: perfect! Highly recommend if your a fan of dark comedies, or good filmmaking in general. I didn't think shows could get much better than "the wire" or "it's always sunny in Philadelphia". It's even up there, or perhaps better than, such films as "pulp fiction" and "the shawshank redemption". Anyway enough complimenting this show, lord knows it has enough recognition it doesn't need me to say anything. But I will leave you with this thought, every other show I have seen in the past, when I found out it was getting canceled I was relieved since most shows have run their course by this time so I want to see how it is closed out and say goodbye for good. Not only did I not want breaking bad to be canceled but I felt it was getting better every season and needed a few more seasons to do it justice. On the bright side is you won't get bored and begging for the end, you will be begging for Vince Gilligan so release the missing seasons in the future sometimes. So if you are an intelligent, open-minded person who appreciate good television and is sick of the other 95% of mindless garbage that ruins TV, "Breaking Bad" is the show for you! If you watch this show and do not like it, please email me, I am curious to see what the reason is since I have never met someone who has seen the show and not loved it. Possible reasons you won't love breaking bad: 1) Your idea of a great show is "here comes honey boo-boo" or "lizard lick towing", I'm which case there is no hope for you anyway so do not waste your time filling your head with any form of intelligent programming. 2) You are a recovering meth-addict and the sight or name "meth" sends your life into a downward spiral where your selling your body for 5$. In which case I understand and wouldn't recommend this show, i would recommend counseling. 3) You are a hipster douschebag so the thought of liking something that everyone likes drives you crazy. So now you need to prove how much of an individual you are and go against the grain so enjoying this show would be like "being a sheep" or something like that. So instead of watching this show smoke your electronic cigarette indoors so people can say "sir you can't smoke in here", and you can promptly reply "how it's not a real cigarette it is water vapor" "I only smoke it to get attention it's not harmful to anyone's physical health, only mental health. 4) And last reason you won't love breaking bad: you died and now your a ghost and can't change the channel to put it on cuz the dumb-ass human you are haunting continues to watch a marathon of "hard-core pawn" while chain-smoking crystal meth and e-cigs. Firstly and foremost i'm not going to blabber on with a comparison of other successful television series i.e, GOT, SOA, LOST, DEXTER and the rest of these brilliant projects. This is a series in an entirely different and unique realm of TV.<br/><br/>After hearing through the internet/tabloid grapevine that Bryan Cranston would be taking the lead in a new AMC series it got me very excited and anxious,..anxious with regards to the fact that this fresh series would be conveyed in a ''Black Comedy Drama'' setting, to which I felt intrigued whether Mr Cranston could pull it off? not only does he 'Pull Off' the role of Walter White in this 5 series bonanza, he moulds walter white into one of the biggest on screen marvels of ALL TIME, Bryan Cranston is a truly terrific actor who deserves nothing but praise and commendation for his electrifying performance as the power hungry, ruthless Meth Kingpin...Just for the record his display of Walter White is so good it grabbed the attention of Hollywood legend Sir Anthony Hopkins who personally wrote an email to congratulate Bryan Cranston on his depiction of Walter White.<br/><br/>Obviously the show isn't glorious purely on Cranston's acting ability, huge credits have to be awarded to the brilliant cast namely Aaron Paul Anna Gunn, Dean Norris, RJ Mitte, Betsy Brandt, Bob Odenkirk and many other worthy actors/actresses who brought this series to life.<br/><br/>It would be scandalous of me not to mention the brain behind this project, Vince Gilligan, a insanely talented and imaginative screen writer/producer/director who injected the show with a shot of pure class.<br/><br/>Overall I just can't describe how perfect this series is, there just isn't enough words, even with the 1000 characters I'm allocated for this review.<br/><br/>Bottom Line, just watch it, it will probably be the finest thing you'll ever set your eyes on. It certainly was for me.<br/><br/>Magnificent. Ever since Tony Montana i was not thrilled until i saw the performance of Bryan Cranston as Walter White. The series begins with a chemistry teacher who is detected with terminal cancer. On his 50th birthday, Walter, along with his family which includes DEA agent, watches a local news report about a methamphetamine drug bust and is impressed by the amount of money recovered from the dealers. Walter considers secretly cooking meth as a way to ensure his family has money and security after he dies. He accompanies Hank as a ride-along during a DEA drug bust against a local dealer named "Cap'n Cook". During the bust, Walt sees a former student, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), fleeing from the scene, and realizes that Jesse is the dealer Hank is investigating. Using the school's records, Walt tracks down Jesse and blackmails him into letting him enter the drug trade.[16] The two form a partnership in which Walt will manufacture meth and Jesse will sell it, producing the product in an RV that Jesse purchases with Walt's life savings.<br/><br/>Very recommended series. The actors performance is great. This may be one of the best shows on TV I have seen. This show was excellent. The acting, the story, the characters, all masterfully done. <br/><br/>From the start we know this story is going to be a tragedy. An underachieving genius with a terminal illness decides to start down a dark path as means to better provide for his family. Or is that the excuse he tells himself? As Walt dives further into the darkness, the dangers grow, as does the evil within him until he simply embraces his alter ego. Dr. Jekyll unable to control Mr. Hyde (or simply not wanting to). He goes from being Walt, to embracing Heisenberg (You know my name).<br/><br/>The show also managed to do, what very few shows are able to, and that is ending when it was time. Far too many times a show doesn't know when to stop, and starts to get stale, or jumps the shark as they say. Not here. While the end is predictable, and Walt's fate known from very early in the show, it is still satisfying to watch unfold. wow!what a great series. 1 shouldn't missed this show. Bryan Cranston@Mr.Heisenberg...You are such a great actor. Just loved this show. Totally worth watching. Cant believed its over. All those thrills,the excitement...wow...just wow......the actors are great too. Vince Gilligan thanks for such a wonderful series. AMC thanks for presenting yet a wonderful show like this beside "The Walking Dead". Hoping for many more wonderful shows from amc and Vince of course... it was great waiting for the show while it was running. The storyline's just perfect. A perfect pack.Aaron Paul also did a great job.All the crewz are awesome. Breaking Bad is as ominous and poignant as it is amusing and flippant, the escapades of the Chemistry Genius High school teacher gone rogue with an ex student is as comical as it is meaningful, but what really provides is how striking this series is as an enigmatically exceptional production that ceases to amaze on both levels of scope and scale.<br/><br/>From the beginning to the end Breaking Bad exceeds to captivate and involve the audience cognitively and materialistically, each episode holds equal to importance and intrigue; the choreography illustrates masterful simplicity in coherence with the plot. Throughout the series the audience is played emotionally. Empathy and apathy play fundamental roles in the portrayal of characters that never once become a tedious appendage to the bigger picture, even less significant roles are imposed as impacting and spur charisma and diversity into a story line that at first glance seems rudimentary.<br/><br/>Walter White, the main role in Breaking Bad is acted and directed in exemplary fashion, his pitiful situation reflects a superlative in character development and provides an ample perspective to the resultant outlet of his intentions. The family of Walter, while being implied as implicitly innocent actually come into interaction with the dark side of Walter White often, this continuity and differentiation between clandestine and regular give not only Walter White two sides of a coin but also his lifestyle and the subsequently subversively progressive nature of the plot.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad holds true to the realism and philosophy of ethical and morale situations, while also making these situations entertaining in a perversely farcical manner. It's this often uncannily insinuative implication of life's misdemeanours that makes Breaking Bad such an unimpeachable, refreshing and original achievement. Among the series I've watched so far, some faded away after a couple of seasons, became diluted and mainstream. But I say this one is unique in terms of story development. I feel it gets more and more exciting season after season. The dialog was short to the point that the story wants to convey without deliberation and with some everyday familiar context. Abundant use of specific techniques ranging from zooming scenes on small little things to fast forward scenes, also kind of serve as a theme of Breaking Bad. The best part of it is excellent character depiction. Every actor and actress was really good at the respective role and not just them, the screenplay writers make the scenes longer. I normally agree with filmmakers when they don't want to show excessive seconds every scene as it could derail the story. The downside is the audience is unrealistically crammed what the makers want to show with just dialogs. But in Breaking Bad, the scene may not cut after a character finished conversation and slammed the door but followed him a bit longer when he expressed his state of mind. So all in all, I recommend Breaking Bad 10/10. If you haven't already watched this series or are not sure then don't hesitate - just get it onto your watch list!<br/><br/>The use of unusual opening scene camera angles is fun. There are also some 'flash forward' scenes which just give enough away to put the full episode in context. All in all, the editing is outstanding and enables a quicker paced approach than some other more leisurely based series like the Sopranos. <br/><br/>I watched the series via LOVEFILM but will be buying the box set so I can do it all again and see what I missed first time round. I've never done this before for any other TV shows. Life is NOT too short for a second viewing!<br/><br/>The next paragraph contains a spoiler so please stop reading now if you don't want to see it.<br/><br/>Spoiler START Only one criticisms and that is the unrealistic plane crash scenario. The coincidence is just a bit beyond what is acceptable even for 'poetic license'. i give a 9 not a 10 simply because we need to hold our breaths for most part of the show..the lighter moments do not contain much wit and humor.The show pretty much reflects reality in terms of Walter's cancer,so you cannot experience immense joy or laughter watching that family..and his wife is also the type of person who's concerned with every little details of her husband's life and very curious when she feels the husband's hiding something..the plot is great,the storyline is great..but,you won't laugh or even smile much during the show even when it's a little bit slow..so prepare to acknowledge the reality what any serious sickness can do to you... The character development of Walter White and Jesse Pinkman is just amazing the love and hate relationship between the two could be a show in of its self (altgough I cant see spinoffs being good for the Breaking Bad series). The high school chemistry teacher going on a DEA ride along meets his ex student who is making Meth and decides to join in on the operation. The two acquire an RV to cook with Walts chemistry supplies. Walt is in it for famliy because of his lung cancer Jesse is well Jesse. Walt and Jesse shares some famously amusing quotes that if you don't know you need to! One complaint about the show is there are only 5 seasons that I have enjoyed a lot but tgen again its better to go out with a bang then sputring downward spiral of viewership like some hit shows such as the Office over stayed there time. All the characters come in to the show and make it worth watching and never disapoints. Better Call Saul is a spin off and is coming November im a little scared sure a reunion would be nice but Saul for a whole new TV show I don't know. The series Breaking BAd is excellent. When I saw the first episode I was immediately in love :) I finished seeing the first series I was blown away ... :) Now I've seen all the episodes I am absolutely sure that is the best series made throughout history ...! Surpasses all others with distinction ... Who likes a good argument and appreciates quality stuff, with all certainty that I will find it and give note 10 to this series. It is the BEST SERIES MADE UP TO TODAY!! I hope for more shows like this in the future :)<br/><br/>The series braking Bad will be remembered in the next 100 years. 100 years from now maybe this series will still continue to be in the Top 10 on this site :)<br/><br/>If not in the top 10 is better for us because it is a sign that in 100 years have made at least 10 excellent series like this Non-stop adrenalin-rush crime-drama following the story of Albuquerque chemistry teacher Cranston turning into a methamphetamine kingpin in order to secure his family's finances after being diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer, calling upon ex-student Paul to assist in the streetwise aspect of the drug business. Cranston is perfect in one of the most mind-blowing hero-to-villain transformations, backed by unforgettable recurring characters like Saul Goodman (played by Bob Odenkirk), Gustavo "Gus" Fring (played by Giancarlo Esposito), Mike Ehrmantraut (played by Jonathan Banks), Todd Alquist (played by Jesse Plemons), Lydia Rodarte-Quayle (played by Laura Fraser), Gale Boetticher (played by David Costabile), Victor (played by Jeremiah Bitsui) and the Salamanca Family (played by Mark Margolis, Raymond Cruz, and twins Daniel and Luis Moncada). Unfortunately, the major supporting roles played by Paul, Gunn, Norris, Mitte, Brandt and Quezada all take their turns at being incredibly annoying or ridiculously codependent on the despicable main character. The show's intensity ends up overshadowing some great themes and symbols involving moral consequences and family devotion. Also, for such a nail-biting show, the ante isn't actually raised all that much in hindsight. Still, and most importantly, it's an overall excellent show—actually one of the few series that literally gets better and better as it progresses. High recommended.<br/><br/>***½ (out of four) This is a fantastic series and if you give it 3 episodes you'll be addicted. The changes within the characters throughout the series' is brilliant but myself I found the ending incredibly predictable and disappointing. This is what stopped it getting a 10/10 from me. The tension and cliffhangers leave you wanting more and I myself spent 3 weeks watching the episodes back to back between working. This programme doesn't really have a target audience because everything about it is so good. Basically if you're not into it after 3 episodes stop watching. Second only to my number 2 GOT (but you have to like the genre) and my number 1 'The Shield' which has numerous themes used in Breaking BAd. I have no words for this show. It is without question the best show on earth. People think the walking dead is better but trust me its not. This show is rated the highest show on IMDb. The acting is awesome. And they never stop running out of ideas. In every episode there is a twist. I especially liked the pilot episode and every one of the season finales. If you don't watch breaking bad you do not have a life and you should start because it will become your favorite show. GUARANTEED. My favorite person in breaking bad is Jesse pinkman. He always makes me laugh with his personality and twists. My favorite episode was when they killed hank and Skyler holds a knife on Walter. Then Walter junior attacks his dad to save his mom. That was the biggest twist in the show. I loved that episode but I was very sad because hank died. You have to start watching this NOW Photography, acting, storyline. Relationships intermingle with action. Unpredictable plot turns. Great character development. I cant think of any TV drama that comes close. (Seinfeld is a 10 but thats a different genre). The dynamic between Walt and Jesse, Walt and Skyler and Walt and Hank each have their own development ups and downs. The beginning of each show is an attention grabber, the viewer gets immediately hooked. I especially love the colorful supporting characters: lawyer Saul who acts unethical and illegal but strangely is loyal to his clients and can be trusted with millions of dollars. Mike is from the old Mafia school and of course Hank's wife is hilarious. Having a handicapped child, cancer and a cheating wife gives drug dealer Walt some sympathy. Will his empire grow? Or will it collapse? Great show! It looks like Vince Gilligan has cooked up meth of his own: the show which is so addictive that we, the viewers, keep wanting more of it. The addicting element for me in the show "Breaking Bad" is the depth, to which the author explores human character. W.W. is not a protagonist, he is a true antagonist, whose redeeming qualities wither away with each new episode. <br/><br/>When the chemistry teacher, who is obviously passionate about his subject, receives a life- changing diagnosis, we all feel badly for him, for his family, and for his unborn daughter. He seems like a good guy, who leads a "normal" life working hard to provide for his family. Most of us try to understand him and justify his choices when he breaks the law cooking meth in order not to leave his family behind penniless. We even root for him to succeed! <br/><br/>However, as more events unfold, it becomes clear that proving to the world his genius is the sole driving force behind Walter's actions. His cancer is merely a catalyst that has accelerated the process. I believe one's true nature is stripped naked in excruciatingly difficult circumstances. W.W. finds himself in such upon learning about his cancer. And we, the viewers, hopefully begin to see through him.<br/><br/>A man, who loves his family, does not put his family in danger. A man, who understands what it means to be a friend and a partner, does not betray. A man, who values life, does not wash his hands with innocent people's blood. A man, who is a genius, does not have to prove it to the whole world. <br/><br/>A brilliant chemist, who has not received a recognition he believes he deserves, a manipulative son of a bitch, who only knows how to use people, an egotistic maniac, who is obsessed with sanitary conditions of the physical world, Walter White gives a new meaning to the scum of the earth. <br/><br/>I was sad to see Mike go. He saw right through W.W. I hope Jesse will too. Who knows, Jesse Pinkman might just turn out to be our Jesse James! If I were writing this show, this is how I would end it, with Jesse blooming into a real "hero." <br/><br/>I hope that giving up Gilligan's meth won't be too painful when the show comes to its end! This is such a tough review to write for this show. Much like your emotions as you watch this. Every character has something you root for and something you hate about them. I found myself cheering for Jesse much of the time, but he is a meth junkie and cook. Not the person you generally cheer for. I keep wanting to root for Walt in a weird way, but his evilness is taking him over.<br/><br/>I think the character development is what I really appreciate about this series. Each character has a background that makes the character human and someone you can relate to. I really enjoyed the character background of Gus. He is such an interesting character.<br/><br/>Another thing I really like about the show is each episode has parts that are very funny. Saul is the sleazy lawyer for many of the characters and I laugh each time he is on the screen. Walt's brother in-law (DEA agent) is a trip and just plain funny.<br/><br/>For anyone wishing to start watching here are some suggestions: 1) The concept of a chemistry teacher becoming a drug dealer after getting a cancer scare is a stretch in a way. But the story allows you to make it OK, you just have to keep an open mind. 2) You have to be OK with most of the main characters doing immoral stuff. You have to watch it as entertainment and stay curious how the story lines play out. 3) Put your seat belt on because there are twist throughout the seasons.<br/><br/>When I watch the show, I feel dirty afterwards and feel like it is real life, which means the show makes me feel like I am in each episode.<br/><br/>Overall, a unique show that has not been done before. If you like Lost and the Walking Dead, then you will most likely like this series. I can't stop myself watching this movie till end.In short it is a nice movie.Naturalization is very fine as well as characters.It is different form the past stories.a struggling high school chemistry teacher who is diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer at the beginning of the series.He turns to a life of crime,producing and selling something with a former student.This is all for creating a nice situation inside the movie.The viewers will never get bored.it is difficult to write for Walter White because the character is so dark and morally questionable.Another nice thriller is that Walter's wife who was pregnant with their second child prior to his diagnosis,and who becomes increasingly suspicious of her husband after he begins behaving in unfamiliar ways.nice to watch movie. I felt compelled to write because I really enjoyed breaking bad, not all of it, but it had its thrilling moments, ones really memorable are the turtle scene, bombing Gus and the second encounter with Tuco.<br/><br/>What I really need to say, the fact that Walter is victimizing himself in way that you can relate to is well crafted. He has a grandiosity dementia which is the product of his acute intelligence, yet sometimes, he is sensitive and breakable by the least of emotions. Severe paranoia mixed with psychopathic morale is the actual trade mark of Heisenberg.Creating such a character is really a job well done! We are almost days away of the final 8 episodes, and let me be frank for a moment, the first 8 were not up to par. The absence of a powerful adversary kinda took away the magic of Breaking Bad, Walter is going down, one way or the other, but I hope his fall is going to be as memorable as the fall of Hitler, if you know what I mean.<br/><br/>P.S: Spinning off Saul, eh, fed up with corrupted lawyer drama, I would rather see a crossover between Hannibal and Heisenberg. Breaking Bad is so good!! The writing is simply incredible. When I first started watching this show I was hesitant because I typically don't watch shows like this. (I prefer, SNL, 30 rock etc) But when my cousin told me to watch it, after at least 3 episodes I got hooked! The plot is extremely intense, and super suspenseful. Bryan Cranston is an amazing actor, the character he plays is extremely complex due to learning he has lung cancer in the pilot, then later hiding a secret life of cooking meth from his pregnant wife. As someone who only knew him as 'the dad from Malcom in the Middle' he is so much more then that! His performance in this show, its truly phenomenal, in every way. There's a little bit of humor throughout the series as well, which lightens the hectic plot. I'd say the only downside is that, there aren't that many episodes, the seasons aren't your typical 20-25 episode seasons. I wouldn't suggest this show for younger audiences, because there is a solid amount of cursing, constant discussion of drugs, a little blood and guts and some sex. Other then that, its totally worth watching!! I never got to watch this show on TV (apart from the pilot which I loved) as I was always working so I only ever caught the odd show. So I have rented seasons one and two from the DVD store and will be doing the same with the following seasons.<br/><br/>This show is superb from the acting to the dialogue to the sets to the characters to the directing to the realism to the classic character names (Gonzo, Skinny Pete, No-doze, Badger to name a few). It has everything I could ever want.<br/><br/>I love how the two main characters White and Pinkman develop and change with Mr White undergoing the most severe metamorphosis, sometimes subtle and sometimes in your face. His change, even by season two, is significant having gone from the typical suburban husband, who has never lived up to his own personal expectations of what his life should have been to the hardcore get it done at all costs semi street wise drug pusher. The scene where Mr White lets Pinkman's manipulative, ambitious girlfriend die from her drug overdose is permanently etched in my mind. You can see the thought processes and the hesitations as White considers whether to assist this girl or not ultimately knowing that to protect his family and Pinkman he has no other choice but to let her die. Just another necessary body piled up along the way and with it another small step towards becoming just like the vile characters that Whiteman has had to deal with in the drug world. Another death necessary to ensure the survival of his family.<br/><br/>In Season One I liked Pinkman and thought he was given a bad wrap by White. I thought Pinkman had potential to be a very capable business partner even though he was prone to making some immature and stupid choices. Despite this he does bring his druggie contacts and street smarts to the table. This enables Mr White to infiltrate a society much quicker than he would have on his own if at all. However in Season Two Pinkman just continues to make every possible cockup there is and potentially derail the whole operation at every turn by making small but key mistakes through oversight, bad judgement or just not thinking. You sense the frustration from White which threatens to explode at every turn and scene.<br/><br/>The relationship between Pinkman and White is complex. At one point Mr White states that for every step forward they make they take two steps backwards. So true. Every time they make some decent money something happens so they lose this coin or they have to pay bribes or make payoffs to avoid going down and so Mr White has to keep "cooking". White and Pinkman are like an old married couple forever arguing and deriding each other interspersed with the odd happy time due to some temporary success. Yet they are intimately linked together not seemingly able or wanting to escape "the beast" they have created. Despite heavy criticism of Pinkman by White and vise versa you can tell that White still feels a certain minor level of responsibility towards Pinkman at least by the end of season two. This of course may change as the seasons progress.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad reflects what ordinary people will do in the name of survival. I have always believed that despite mankind's modernization and progress you only need to scratch at the surface to reveal people's true motivations and what individuals will do in order to live another day. This is a show that uncovers the seedy side of society and shows the ordinary viewer that the drug world may not be quite what they expected.<br/><br/>Despite seemingly a licence to print money for the upper echelons there is always a cost. You have to be prepared to do very bad things and have a certain moral flexibility. Actually your success in the drug world means having no morals and no empathy for other people for if you have these traits or show any weakness it will for sure be your undoing.<br/><br/>So for those that have ever pondered going down this road BB is a fantastic wake up call all from the safety of your armchair.<br/><br/>I am looking for forward to the watching the remaining seasons. Firts off all actors from this series is making their job amazing.Especially Walter white(Bryan Cranston) make this series special.<br/><br/>The negative part of this series is sometimes you can get bored easily because The theme is always same.And sometimes you think that can a man do all of it? And that make this series far away from realism. And if you make Show that has been improved from a realist theme you should keep on doing it. or else it makes people who watches it sick.But if you making this for money you are right Because nobody wants to see something ordinary.But still better than all the other crazy staff<br/><br/>This is unique show that you never watch equal. 9/10 Ä°f you still haven't started you miss a lot...
