Just watched this for the first time, and enjoyed it immensely. Some here have suggested that there's no 'real' story at all. I don't agree: Lynch doesn't work like that - no matter how bizarre and reticulated, there's a story there, all right, but you have to dig for it.<br/><br/>'Mulholland Drive' informs this film considerably. Having deconstructed that one to my satisfaction, I have a clearer view of how Lynch does things; how he shows us the elements, the language he uses, and what he leaves out for us to discover. So, then - *SPOILERS*, if I'm right:<br/><br/>As with MD, there's a big clue in the first few seconds: Fred is shown in close-up, looking thoroughly wrecked, smoking a cigarette unsteadily. There's a buzzing sound, and light sweeps across his face and the room. *The sound is one you'll become familiar with later, in the jailhouse.* Fred looks up, warily.<br/><br/>Major premise: I believe this scene shows Fred, in the last moments of his life, having his last cigarette before they come to take him to the chair. This may, in fact, be the only 'real' scene in the film, with everything else being Fred's distorted recollection, and the rest a psychotic break fantasy he constructs to escape from his grim situation.<br/><br/>As the door to his cell opens, Fred rejects the awfulness of reality, and transforms the buzz into the sound of his door intercom, and at this point we go into his personal flashback as the story continues.<br/><br/>The acting and dialogue is often stilted and unrealistic in this flashback. What we're seeing is Fred's recollection, which - as he himself says - is not necessarily the way it actually happened. His relationship with Renee is tense and unreal, with lots of suppressed rage. Cleverly, the undercurrents are conveyed mostly by the background sounds - listed in the credits as 'Ominous drones' - and these provide the significance that the dialogue alone would lack.<br/><br/>At the party scene several events take place: his suspicions about Renee and the impossibly sleazy - because he's seen through Fred's eyes - lounge-lizard Andy are effectively confirmed (for him). And he meets the 'Mystery Man', a devil-figure who tells Fred "You invited me (into your home). It is not my custom to go where I'm not wanted". I suspect that this figure is Fred's attempt to unload his guilt onto someone else: a 'devil who made him do it' - don't you have to invite the devil into your house? Perhaps he's the personification of Fred's insanity, or his jealousy. Or all of the above - all the dark influences in Fred's life and head.<br/><br/>As the flashback continues, we see the progression up to the point where he finally does murder Renee, horribly. Again he attempts to reject the reality by showing it all on video, but reality intrudes and a few seconds are shown of him 'really' sitting among the dismembered parts of his wife. His subsequent trial and sentencing are skipped over - they're a blur to Fred - and he winds up on Death Row.<br/><br/>Facing execution, and unable to tolerate his real state, Fred then creates a fantasy in which he escapes his fate by miraculously turning into another person - an innocent: young, enjoying a simple life, good at his simple job; with groovy, understanding parents and a pliable girlfriend.<br/><br/>The scenes around Fred's miraculous replacement are classic Lynch fantasy-made-real: the dialogue is ludicrous; the events comic-book. We see the same in the fantasy world of the central character in MD.<br/><br/>Although safe in this new fantastical environment, Fred/Peter is unable to resist being drawn back into danger, initially via his unlikely relationship with the - again comic-book - gangster boss, Mr. Eddy. This gangster character is a one-dimensional, violent crazy man who recalls the fantasy mafia types invented by the central character in MD to 'explain' her bad break.<br/><br/>Even so, Peter's life will remain peaceful if he avoids any dealings with Eddy outside of the grease-monkey relationship. But Fred's paranoia demands danger, and Peter begins an even less plausible and obviously perilous association with Fred's new incarnation of Renee: the pure-hearted damsel in distress that is Alice.<br/><br/>Except that, once again, Peter's life is contorted by Fred's paranoia, and Alice slowly metamorphoses into a spiteful, greedy psychotic who leads Peter further into danger. <br/><br/>(I looked for the 'Eye of the Duck' peripeteiac scene that Lynch always puts into his films, and one of the candidates is, I think, the moment where Alice points the gun at him after raiding 'Andy's' house. The tableau is held long enough to allow you to contemplate all that could happen if she shoots Peter and takes off. But that's not possible in a Fred/Peter fantasy, so we continue, with the point about her ruthlessness made.)<br/><br/>What else? The storyline continues as might be expected, with Alice now in total control. The cabin we've seen before just prior to Fred's metamorphosis. Alice disappears. The Mystery Man returns, and so does Mr. Eddy and Fred. All of this in a fight, during which the devil-figure hands him a knife that allows him to defeat Eddy/Dick Laurent (as we have discovered), and finally everything turns to crap as Fred heads back onto the highway with retribution on his tail. Things look hopeless, and the escape fantasy has brought him back to the point where he came in.<br/><br/>And then Fred begins another metamorphosis, which we never see completed, and the film ends. Is this another fantasy escape, or his death in the Chair? <br/><br/>I don't know how much of this is correct. Perhaps one day someone will tie Mr. Lynch to a rack, put electrodes on his nuts, and extract the line-by-line details of his wonderful creations. Until then we must wonder and worry. And marvel. Clearly, as with most of David Lynch's films, Lost Highway is not for everyone.  It is, as Lynch intended it to be, a film realization of a dream. In this regard, it is comparable, in terms of artistry and raw intensity to Kurosawa's _Dreams_.  Indeed, in terms of sensory experience - cinematography and sound, for example - Kurosawa and Lynch have few rivals. However, the comparison falls away rather quickly in consideration of the film's content.  Lost Highway is really no dream, but a nightmare.<br/><br/>Let's face it, like it or not, everything Lynch does is intentional.  This film has inspired polarized reviews here on IMDB.  Those looking for a plot-heavy movie that they do not necessarily have to pay attention to tend to despise it.  Those who are open to allowing this manipulative, intensely disturbing and thought-provoking film to carry them into its own parcel of hell love it.  This is, in my opinion, what good art can do.<br/><br/>Like a dream, Lost Highway has as many plots as it does viewers with their own individual interpretations and perspectives.  It forces itself upon you with a vengeance, but simultaneously encourages the kind of disengagement you experience when you are conscious that you are dreaming.<br/><br/>I recommend Lost Highway highly.  See it with intelligent, open-minded friends who like to talk about film experiences.  And expect that the conversation will keep you up way past your bed time. First of all let me say, that it is not as serious, if you don't get the movies of David Lynch at once (or even never). Lynch is not a film maker who tries to make movies with a problem-solving message, but an artist. Moreover he started as a painter and so he tries to create an atmosphere more than to develop a story.<br/><br/>Most viewers will have realized that "Lost Highway" is a story about a schizophrenic murderer (even Lynch mentioned it). But that is not the complete clue to the movie. Cause everyone is aware of Fred's metamorphosis (although no one seems to really care about). So his mutation seems to be real and till the end no one proves the opposite! But "Lost Highway" is not a common movie about schizophrenia like "Beautiful Mind" or "Das weiße Rauschen" (Which is a must-see, too!). INSANITY IS NOT THE SUBJECT, BUT THE NARRATIVE PRINCIPLE OF THE MOVIE! In other words: The movie is not a presentation of mental sickness, but a complete sick presentation, which means that the subjective perception of the protagonist becomes the objective reality! You'll find this way of telling a story quite often in surrealistic literature (i.e Franz Kafka's "Die Verwandlung" engl.: "Metamorphosis" - just note the title!!).<br/><br/>All Lynch-Movies refer to mental illness or the state of dreaming: No character ever seems to care about the illogical and irrational twists of the plot(just like in dreams), the landscapes are unrealistic and change appearance or size and the story takes place at deserted areas (forests, claustrophobic rooms, industrial areas, desserts) far away from civilization or reality!<br/><br/>Insanity - Sanity/ Evil - Good/ Reality - Fiction are no longer categories one can rely on. The protagonists see their surroundings and environment always threatening, but they never question it! They act with such a matter of course, that one has to ask whether it is ignorance, naiveté or self-deception. Perhaps you don't have to ask yourself how far you are able to UNDERSTAND the message. Perhaps you have to ask yourself how far you are willing to ACCEPT the message. Be aware, that once you started seeing the world at a different way you will follow that white rabbit right the way in his burrow... David Lynch is known for his  art films; films that defy the rules and rubricks a movie should follow. Of course, Lynch isn't one to follow any kind of Hollywood Rule. His films always have a general sense of the surreal, of emotions only understandable to the characters and actions that defy comprehension. They always have lurid eroticism or at least one character with a sexual perversion. And, for the most part, his films are incomprehensible to a mainstream audience. 'Lost Highway' has just been defined for you, though not explained. Perhaps the film is not meant to be explainable, perhaps it is just an abstract work meant to involve us and toy with our emotions until we forget it right after we leave. But the film is memorable so that cannot be the reason. Maybe Lynch is just working out personal demons and only he is meant to benefit from doing the film. I'll explain what I mean.<br/><br/>'Fred Madison' [Bill Pullman] is a sax player who performs at the local club. He and his wife 'Renee' [Patricia Arquette] live in a funky Lynchian house that seems designed specifically to disturb the audience. Their marriage and sex life is not going well. One day, 'Renee' finds a videotape on the doorstep. When they play it, it is almost like a promotional video for their house, moving down every hallway before entering the bedroom where 'Fred' and 'Renee' are shown sleeping. The tape abruptly shorts out to snow. 'Fred' and 'Renee' are obviously quite bothered by this. They call the police, who don't really impact the situation in any way. Later, at a party, 'Fred' meets an ingratiating pasty-faced man [Robert Blake] at a party who calmly explains ''We've met before, haven't we'' and then goes on to explain they met at 'Fred's house and that the man is ''There right now, phone me''. He does seem to be at both ends of the line. 'Fred' immediately grabs 'Renee and they leave to go home. This leads to one of the most tense and terrifying sequences I have ever viewed on a piece of celluloid since Hitchcock. Since we know Lynch is directing, we know anything could happen......And does.<br/><br/>I have not given away anything. In fact, the events I have described might have never happened. In fact, any event or character that enters the film may or may not have happened. The film exists in it's own queer dimension. Lynch shots the film like a noir, with 'Renee' as the femme fatale. The colors are pitch-dark and lush which helps structure the film into what it is, a psychological nightmare. It manipulates our emotions to a shocking extent and we don't know how Lynch is doing it because nothing in the movie makes sense. Lynch himself uses the phrase 'psychogenic fugue' when describing the movie as he says the hero is 'inventing a fantasy because his real life is so screwed up.' Patricia Arquette is more blatant when describing the film; 'Fred Madison is a f@#$ed up guy who invents a fantasy because his real life is so f%$#ed up. But Fred is so f%$#ed up that his fantasy falls apart...'' Makes sense to me. It would explain the bizarre events and would explain the ending. Fred is so angry and so paranoid that he has a fit in his car, twisting and whipping his head around in circles because his fantasy has gone wrong and collapsed. The film reveals clues that support this explanation. At one point, the pasty-faced man says of Renee ''Her name is Alice, if she told you her name was Renee, she was lying. And you, who the f$#@ ARE YOU!'' This suggests that Renee has used him and that 'Fred' doesn't even know who he is. If you were inventing a fantasy about yourself and you wanted to create a given persona, isn't it possible that you could forget who you were in the first place?<br/><br/>Some people have suggested that the 'Mystery Man' [Robert Blake] is a manifestation of 'Fred's' illness. But then why does it seem that the 'Mystery Man' is trying to help 'Fred'? Perhaps 'Fred' has created the 'Mystery Man' in the hopes that this being will solve the mystery for him, to egg him on until he saves himself. And the mob boss 'Mr Eddy' [Robert Loggia] is the real villain: cold, calculating, abusive and spontaneously violent, just like a virus. And 'Renee/Alice' is just one of the virus' cohorts, reproduced from the DNA of the virus to spread the illness and incapacitate the victim.<br/><br/>Or perhaps the most likely explanation; It is a Lynchian fantasy designed to screw the mainstream audience and entertain open moviegoers.This makes the most sense. People will always want to explain this film, to dig up it's secrets. Maybe the secrets will never be uncovered. Maybe there are no secrets and it is just a Lynch film calculated to please his fans. Any way you see it, it will never be solved. I wish you good luck if you try to solve the film in its entirety,... But you will certainly have fun doing it. I started this film upon renting it one night at 11:00 PM.  I finished at about 1 in the morning.  I was so stunned and awestruck that I stayed up until 3 in the morning to watch it again.  This is one of the most spell-binding movies I have ever seen.  Each time I see it my theory of the plot thickens.  What I love about the movie is that it leaves you with the option to fill in the blanks.  You will keep asking what happened and why that happened, but that is what makes the movie so awesome.  David Lynch's skewed opinion of reality is very inspiring and I feel that my reality has changed ever since I watched it.  Having watched it 13 times I can pretty safely say that my theory of the plot is set, but I still love to ponder exactly why. Buckle your seat belts: this film is quite the ride. As so often with David Lynch's movies, 'Lost Highway' doesn't bother with a traditional narrative and follows its own, dreamlike (or nightmarish) logic. It is a wild, expressionist work of art, and while it starts on a slow, brooding note, the film soon explodes into a crazy, violent trip that hooks you competely and doesn't let up. My advice to people unfamiliar with Lynch's work is this: just enjoy the experience and let yourself be immersed. While it is fun to analyze Lynch's movies, especially his most surreal ones, they're not mysteries that require resolution in order to be enjoyed.<br/><br/>As for the filmmaking itself, the pacing is fantastic throughout, the cinematography outstanding and the cast of character actors like Bill Pullman, Robert Loggia and Patricia Arquette simply a joy to watch (especially Loggia gets to shine in a wonderfully over-the-top part). Another aspect that should not go unmentioned is the music. The orginal score by Angeolo Badalamenti (who is to Lynch what John Williams is to Spielberg) is hauntgingly beautiful, but equally important is the amazing soundtrack - featuring greats like David Bowie, Lou Reed, Rammstein, Marilyn Manson, Trent Reznor and more - which fits and enhances the images on screen perfectly.<br/><br/>As far as I'm concerned, this is Lynch at his best. 'Lost Highway' is a dark, violent, surreal, beautiful, hallucinatory masterpiece: 10 stars out of 10.<br/><br/>Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/<br/><br/>Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/<br/><br/>Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/<br/><br/>Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/ This is the first film directed by David Lynch I've seen, not counting The Elephant Man, which is another great film, but is an outsider in his career, since it is not surreal. This film is, however, making it the first typical Lynch film I've seen. And I'm honestly not sure what to make of it. I had heard a lot about Lynch's films before watching, but I guess I hadn't heard enough. I went into this film hoping for a good mystery, an interesting puzzle to solve. As the end credits rolled I didn't know what to make of what I had just seen. I didn't get an answer to the question I kept asking while I was watching; "What exactly is this film about?". As soon as the credits were over, I read a comment or two by Lynch fans... and the truth dawned on me. It's not supposed to be solved. It's not a movie where you, when you see the very end, exclaim "Ah! Now I get it!". This film won't provide you with some twist ending or have a character come up to the lead and explain it all. It's not supposed to make perfect sense or be easily explainable. It's not real. It's fantasy. Fiction. The whole film is like a dream, or, more appropriately, a nightmare. The film is great; it's just not for me. I won't let that affect my rating, however. This was an excellent example of masterful film-making. Lynch's direction is eminent, evidenced by the fact that I kept watching, despite not understanding half of what was going on or being able to sympathize with any character(something we are much too used to from mainstream movies). The lighting is great. Lynch really plays around with it, and it's always interesting to look at. It also really adds to the mood, nicely set by careful editing and music usage. The acting is flawless, and that is not a term I use lightly. All in all, a wonderfully well-done film, but definitely not for everyone. Wasn't in my tastes, but I enjoyed how well-made it was regardless. I recommend this to fans of art films, rather than conventional ones. Fans of Lynch should enjoy this. Very surreal and loose. 10/10 I believe it was the legendary Homer Simpson who once gave the ideal description on David Lynch productions. During watching a Twin Peaks'-episode he said, `Brilliantbut I don't get it'. Too trueyou love what you're seeing and you want to be a part of the mysterious Lynch universe! You actually feel the urge to search for solutions, you want to solve the riddle that is Lost Highway and you desperately try to do sountil you realize it's in fact a puzzle that cannot be solved. Therefore, my advice would be: Don't try to be Einstein and develop too many theories' just get overwhelmed by Lost Highway and enjoy the mixture of weirdness, violence and erotica you get to see. It's amazing what David Lynch pulls off here! He serves an absurd and impossible structure that involves an inexplicable metamorphosis of the protagonist and he actually gets away with it!! Meanwhile, he introduces a bunch of bizarre  but extremely fascinating  characters of which you don't know they're real or just creations of a mentally ill mind. Lynch in top-condition, in other wordsyou almost start to suspect he's laughing with his audience.  The quality of Lost Highway is brought up to an even higher level by the terrific musical score (Angelo Badalamenti), a blasting soundtrack (Rammstein!) and sublime acting. Bill Pullman and Balthazar Ghetty supply each other terrifically, even though they don't have ONE scene together. And Patricia Arquetteeither blond or brunette looks gorgeous. No wonder men in this film fall into madness over her. <br/><br/>Lost Highway comes with my highest possible recommendation, yet I still prefer the David Lynch of the lat 70's and 80's. Can't really give a reasonable explanation for this Films like Blue Velvet and Eraserhead had something extra. This was the first time I was in anticipation of the release of a David Lynch film.  Having only discovered his movies (and Twin Peaks) in the period of 1992-1997.   I became a huge fan, owning several films on video as well as the complete Twin Peaks series.<br/><br/>I was not disappointed with Lost Highway.  A film that left me totally stunned.  A film that I did not want to end, in the hope that I could figure out what was going on.  A film that left some scenes imprinted on my brain like a tattoo.   A film that is a dream.<br/><br/>This film is what dreams are.  There are times when you feel you control the dream, and times where you feel it escapes you.  Slow and rapid events. Images that don't make sense.  Fantasy. Horror.  Surrealism.  Symbolism. All part of a long dream, that I doubt anyone can decipher, including Mr Lynch.<br/><br/>Seeing this film for the second time with a person who truly did not "get it" (though I thank her for her patience to watch the whole film), made realise that there are two kinds of people in this world.  I love this film. I can't wait to watch it again. I absolutely loved this movie. I have always loved to watch a good flick that puts my brain to the test. Maybe the film isn't suppose to make much sense, but that's what I love about it. You have to try and analyze it and make your own theories about what just took place. This movie isn't for a lot of people and I mean a lot. You have to like movies like Mulholland Drive, Memento, The Man Who Wasn't There, etc.. to even begin to like this one. I'm not necessarily a big David Lynch fan, but this movie rocked big time. <br/><br/>    One of the most eery parts of the film is when (Bill Pullman) is making love to his wife (Patricia Arquette) and her face turns into the mystery man (Robert Blake). A very freaky looking individual, indeed. In my eyes, he represents the devil. But, that's my take on it. <br/><br/>    Another great scene is when Pete is making love to Patricia Arquette in the Desert. The lighting, music, camera angles, emotions and everything is just one of the best pieces of cinemtography I've ever seen in my life.<br/><br/>      My recommendation is this: If you liked Mulholland Drive, Memento, Pulp Fiction, Fargo, The Man Who Wasn't There, Blue Velvet, then this movie is your cup of tea. If not, don't waste your time, cause you'll hate it, more than likely. 3 1/2 *'s out of 4 *'s. I'm not going into the plotline here because I'm limited to 1000 words.  I don't think I can wrap up the plot that space.<br/><br/>I'm a recent inductee into the strange and twisted world of David Lynch. It all started when I caught a rerun of "Twin Peaks" on a low-budget digital satellite channel.  Since then I've been hooked, and have had fun with cult films and filmmakers since.<br/><br/>Lost Highway is, as descried by Lynch, a new twist on film-noir.  And only Lynch could put a twist like this on a classic genre.  People keep wanting to draw comparisons to other films, saying: "Well, it's not Blue Velvet" or "It's not Mulholland Dr,"...they're right.  It's Lost Highway, a unique and twisted foray down a dark highway that may or may not be entirely metaphorical...or metaphysical.<br/><br/>One of the things that I've noticed about David Lynch--and what probably inspires much of the hatred non-Lynch fans have towards his work--is that he doesn't explain everything.  He lays it out, says "Here's my story.  What do YOU make of it?"  It's an incredible artistic attitude, much like viewing a Dali painting as opposed to a Da Vinci, and not for everyone's tastes.<br/><br/>Lost Highway is open to many interpretations, as are most of Lynch's works. Are we in our world, and being invaded by some outside force?  Are we in a world we don't know we're in?  Are we in Hell?  What would you do if this happened to you?  Maybe we are all someone else, really.<br/><br/>
This film is at the same time allegorical, philosophical, incomprehensible, and satirical.  It warps understood movie conventions, and is always pulling the unexpected.<br/><br/>All that praise aside, it is NOT the best of Lynch's work.  One would have to be a fan to enjoy this, and should establish that fanhood with his better works, like Mulholland Drive, Blue Velvet, or "Twin Peaks."<br/><br/>
If one has a set standard of how movies should be, an A-B-C pattern, stay away.  But if it's originality, unanswered questions, and a break from standard Hollywood convention, go full ahead.<br/><br/>In my humble opinion, it's better than Wild at Heart and Dune, but not most of Lynch's rest.  It is definitely an experience, but not one everybody will enjoy. The thing that's great about Lost Highway is there is no absolute solution to the events in the film, everything about the film is open to interpretation and after you watch it you either need to thing and talk about it for a couple of hours or watch it again. In Mulholland Drive, people say that it needs to be watched twice to be fully understood. Lost highway needs to be watched about 3 or 4 time to be slightly understood and will probably never be fully understood. All the clues are there in the film but to include all of them to make sense is very difficult. However it is very rewarding to try and find out the meaning of Lost Highway.<br/><br/>Although it is described as a modern film-noir, it's more inspired by Alfred Hitchcock. The use of music to increase the suspense of the film is used a lot here and in many Hitchcock films such as Psycho. Even if you cant work out what it is about, it is still a very tense thriller.<br/><br/>Final Score  10/10 (Don't read this unless you want it explained). Fred found out that his Wife had done adult films in the past. She promised him she wouldn't do it again. He can't handle it. He's super stressed out about it and can only feel release through playing jazz and having frenetic sex with his Wife. His behavior freaks her out.<br/><br/>She starts to reconnect with her friendships she had neglected due to her marriage. One of them is a former adult film producer/star with whom she had worked years before. Fred sees her talking to him at the party. Their somewhat over friendly behavior gets Fred really angry. They return home with Fred still seething. His Wife tells him that Dick Laurent wants her to go back to her adult film career. His hatred for her past life explodes in a moment of rage when he murders Her in their bedroom. This is the Woman he loves and married. How dare She dirty them both? He gets arrested and thrown in Jail.<br/><br/>While in jail he reminisces about when he met her when He was younger (as Balthazar Getty), more carefree and when She was still pure in his mind. This is why we see two version of his Wife, One pure and clean the other dark and dirty. The fantasy image he wants to hold onto vs the dirty whore. He has fantasies of killing Dick Laurent too, but he can't because he is in jail. His mind finally cracks and he goes crazy, his mind wanting to only remember the good things, but the truth of the horror of his actions keep invading his thoughts. This is what the Mystery Man is. Truth. The truth about his guilt. This is why he follows Fred whever he goes. Because the Truth of our bad actions will always haunt us. Just like the intrusive video tapes. It could be argued then that the whole movie is Fred sitting in jail stewing in insane grief and guilt, yearning to escape and run free ... down The Lost Highway. "Lost Highway" is a great many things, but often seems to be reduced to a love-it or hurts-my-head-from-the-confusion, so-I'll-just-dismiss-it kind of movie. Some critics have written it off as self-indulgent swill, saying that only people who could hope to appreciate it would be Lynch himself and his plethora of wide-eyed adoring fans, etc, etc. I myself have never actually been a huge fan of Lynch, perhaps because I thought his stories didn't take themselves seriously enough, were just too darn quirky, who knows. Still, I've always admired his talent for creating beautiful, disturbing imagery, and "Lost Highway" has to be my favorite film of his, and possibly one of the most beautiful and mesmerizing I've ever seen! Certainly not for everyone, as those who want a definitive "answer," who think that seeing it again and again is really going to explain everything, or those who are simply into the ol' explosion-packed action blockbusters are going to be left shaking their heads. It's definitely open to interpretation. Myself, I'm not one to offer any new insight, I view it as--SPOILER AHEAD??--a purely subjective movie, with nearly all the events seen and largely imagined by its protagonist, Fred Madison, and once you can simply accept him as insane (or at least very imaginative!) you can simply quit puzzling over it and allow yourself to enjoy the ride.<br/><br/>While incarcerated for killing his wive in an act of jealousy, he embarks on a "psychogenic fugue" as an act of last-minute escapism from the looming dread of his upcoming execution--sort of like Ambrose Bierce's "Occurence At Owl Creek Bridge"--imagining himself as a younger, more likable/worthwhile guy (valued auto mechanic, "Mr. Eddy's" favorite), with people who care about him (his parents and girlfriend, as opposed to his real-life murdered wife who didn't even bother to go to his musical performances), and definitely more virile, as he is able to both attract and fulfill his "wife" (seen here as the slutty, icy femme fatale-type he always suspected her to be). However, try as he may, he ultimately can't avoid his past (notice how the fantasy him is put off when he hears Fred's jazz song on the radio in the garage), and thus after the fantasy Alice/Renee rejects him in the desert, he immediately turns back into his typical view of himself--hurt, older, sensitive, vulnerable (represented by his nakedness)--proving that even his fantasies fail him, and thus he's left to die an unpleasant death in the electric chair after all (notice the way he violently contorts in the closing moments, almost as if he's being electrocuted). Call him a modern-day murderous Walter Mitty I guess. The Fred Madison/O.J. Simpson comparisons made by some are interesting--if just a BIT cynical!--though I have to halfway wonder if that real-life spousal jealousy murder case provided any grain of inspiration for this fictional one. The cast is impressive and do a great job; Bill Pullman definitely has the haunted, deer-in-the-headlights look that his confused, out-of-it character requires, though at the same time I don't know if he quite portrays the extreme jealousy and animal savageness deep down inside that caused him to murder his wife as gruesomely as he did (if of course you even want to accept what was on that final videotape as something that actually happened in the first place!). Needless to say, the whole moebius-strip "twist" of having the film end at its beginning greatly complicates any interpretation; even without it, the film could STILL be difficult to decipher by some (heck, I'm still not even really sure what the significance of the Mystery Man was!)<br/><br/>Perhaps the film could have benefited from a few extra scenes or lines of dialogue to make it a little less cryptic for the more literal-minded members of the audience, but still, even by suggesting that you'd be implying that there was one concrete explanation for the film, which there most certainly is not.<br/><br/>Regardless, all plot and interpretations aside, you can almost certainly enjoy for its images, its music (an EXCELLENT soundtrack), for its mood and atmosphere, and simply for it as a whole: dare I say, it's almost more of an experience than anything (though for what it's worth, at the same time I can't think of the last time I saw a film--or work of art period, for that matter--that provoked such a wide variety of interpretations and opinions, as should hopefully be the case with ANY great work of art).<br/><br/>Fascinating. Lighting.  That's the thing I remembered most from the first time I saw this film.  Amazing lighting.  Certain directors, Lynch included, are able to tell the story using camera movement, what's seen/not seen.  Lynch, however, has taken that a step further with the way he chooses to light his scenes - he sculpts his shots in a manner that seems almost more like a theatrical lighting designer's work.  The use of shadows within the home, the stark colors that accompany certain scenes, even the car lighting in the titles - all of this is used to draw the audience's attention to a certain point, and all of it thrills.  With the terse, "European art-film" dialogue style (at first the most distancing thing I found in Lynch's work, it is now one of my favorite elements), sharp sound work, a strong cast, and the marvelous, spiralling structure of the film only reinforcing it's strongest feature - its atmosphere - this is a work that will be discussed long after the credits fade.  In my short 22 years, the best film I've seen, bar none. 'I like to remember things my own way. Not necessarily the way they happened.' <br/><br/>These are the words of Fred Madison (Bill Pullman), a man with an unfair share of problems. He lives in a deadly quiet neighbourhood, in a dark, oddly designed house. He works as a jazz musician in a nightclub and suspects his beautiful wife Renee (Patricia Arquette) of cheating on him. But, without knowing it, he's caught in an infinite, time-travelling, paradox conundrum. Confused? It gets even more complex.<br/><br/>Someone is leaving sinister video tapes on their doorstep. At first it only shows the exterior of their house. But the subsequent tapes reveal a little more and more.<br/><br/>At a party hosted by one of his wife's sleazy 'friends' a mystery man appears out of the crowd and tries to convince Fred that they've met before. Not quite aware of the true nature of the nightmare he's falling into, Fred dismisses this man as crazy and promptly leaves the awful party. At home, Fred disappears into the shadows of the labyrinthine hallway and isn't seen again til next morning.<br/><br/>The last videotape reveals Fred brutally murdering and dismembering Renee. Only he cannot remember doing it. Caught by the cops and sent to prison awaiting the chair, Fred begins to suffer agonising headaches. Then, one night, in solitary confinement, he goes through a psycho-genetic fugue and transforms into a completely different person.<br/><br/>Next morning the guards and warden are freaked to discover Pete Dayton (Balthazar Getty), a 24-year old mechanic, in Fred Madison's cell. With no choice but to let him go, Pete goes back to his parents house while closely tailed by the cops. Something has happened to Pete a few days earlier and his parents are keeping their mouths shut. They can barely comprehend it themselves and it appears that Pete is involved in the same nightmare plot as Fred Madison was.<br/><br/>A powerful gangster named Dick Laurent/Mr. Eddy (Robert Loggia)has a fondness for Pete and his ability to fix any car. But when he swings by the garage with his new floozy Alice Wakefield (Patricia Arquette again) he falls instantly in love with the woman, despite having 'femme fatal' practically tattooed, in bold, on her forehead.<br/><br/>Pete and Alice begin a relationship of nothing but aggressive shagging. And slowly, but surely, a world of mystery unlike anything you've ever seen is so vividly realised that you are practically pulled right into the film itself. The atmosphere is so thick that it'll flood over into your living room.<br/><br/>David Lynch's direction is honed to perfection. The cinematography is flawless and expertly framed. Lynch is a master of space and sound and the world of Lost Highway is at once beautiful and downright evil. He uses sly editing tricks to keep you paying the utmost attention and even if you don't take your eyes off the screen for a slit second it will still takes dozens of viewings to even begin solving it.<br/><br/>The ingenuity of Lost Highway is that it can be interpreted in so many ways but there is always one piece of the puzzle that Lynch has deliberately warped or hammered out of shape so that it doesn't fit and negates any theory you may have. You could spend hours (and I have) painstakingly trying to make sense of it all and you can some close to the answer but be so far from the truth. <br/><br/>Be it a dream or reality, a trip down the Lost Highway is one you seriously need to take. Though you might not come back. The first time I watched this movie I enjoyed it but was left confused as to what was really going on. As a huge fan of Lynch I was expecting as much. So a few days later I watched it again and everything clicked and made perfect sense and seemed so obvious this time.<br/><br/>If you hated it the first time and found nothing interesting then you probably shouldn't watch it again and put yourself though the torture a second time. But if you feel how I did, watch it again and you'll enjoy it much more.<br/><br/>This movie does require a second viewing for a complete understanding of what's happening. In Mulholland Drive and Inland Empire you get what's going on the first time. Multiple viewings make the details much clearer but you don't leave confused like with Lost Highway.<br/><br/>Great story, the first part is truly one of the scariest things I've ever seen. I think one thing about this movie that is interesting is that almost all of the actors are playing roles that you've never seen them do before. And they do it very well. I was a little apprehensive about Pullman being the lead, as I know him from Spaceballs and Independence Day, but he is very good in this. You rarely get a bad performance in a Lynch movie.<br/><br/>My only criticism is that the movie is a little slow and long. Not in a bad way but I do find myself waiting for the end as opposed to some movies where I don't want them to end. I'm actually feeling pretty good about things: I've been liberated. After seeing *part of 'Lost Highway', a life's truth has been revealed: I don't ever have to see another David Lynch film. Hip, hip, hooray!<br/><br/>*The more you see, the more "mysterious" the film becomes, or, putting it another way, the sewage of this guy's mind, badly transferred from film to DVD, in this case,(or perhaps that was the **'look' he wanted) finally bored/aggravated me enough to turn my interests to more engaging things. <br/><br/>**Which look was physically and mentally off-putting and tiring.....literally.<br/><br/>Having spent some years in the film industry,and got to know a couple of dozen producers somewhat, I marvel that Lynch can get the financing to make a film as miserable as 'Lost Highway'. This may be his greatest talent. (How does he convince some financially tough hombres to invest in a story of such low merit?)<br/><br/>So I'll extend myself in the future, with as much time and energy as I can, to continue trying to get Criterion to restore the films of Satjajit Ray, perhaps the greatest filmmaker, who struggled his entire career to raise funds for his movies. <br/><br/>Final comment about some previous rave reviews of L.H.: Comparing Lynch's writing/ideas to Kafka's suggests a superficial misread; Lynch revels in obfuscation while Kafka torturously and brilliantly tries for meaning. All hail David Lynch. All hail the other David Lynch.<br/><br/>Lynch is not a complex man, I think; it is easy to read him. But he is cinematically articulate and its a pleasure of a special sort when you meet an articulate artist. His interest is simply described: duals.<br/><br/>All his films work with some exploration of this idea. What makes him interesting is that he doesn't work the usual way, with a reality and then a surreal overlay. Both elements in his experiments are what we coarsely call "surreal." The game in traveling with him is an investment in the idea that there is no anchor to reality, that all references are among imaginations, sometimes twisted. "Mulholland" was a little too conventional for me because you could actually explain things and one of the realities was sorta real if you ignored a few things.<br/><br/>My favorite Lynch is "Velvet," which imposes the two warring realities on film genres. The most fun is the seemingly straight "Straight" story, which is perhaps the most bizarre encounters of dual strangeness because it seems so ordinary. Dualing roots that keep getting mowed.<br/><br/>But if you are into Lynch, this is an extraordinary pleasure, this one. Its the most obvious in plan, the least hidden in the swirl of two worlds. Neither world is anchored in reality and each hallucinates the other. Probably the only anchor with reality is the most disturbing character in appearance, The Robert Blake guy.<br/><br/>But even these two surrealities are nested in cinematic realities. One is the gangster movie, elevated to cosmic status by the French new wave. The other is visual jazz and the accompanying dream linkages that have been similarly blazed, starting with Dennis Hopper so far as American films.<br/><br/>What you are open to determines what you can get, I suppose. What Lynch provides is a sort of post-post modern notion of film as sometimes centered in itself, with its own cosmologies and lives that always refer to other film notions and never to real ones. There is no fold of us as viewer, no acknowledgment of our world at all (except for the mysterious videos). Celestial madness.<br/><br/>I prepared for this by watching four bad Holmes movies in a row. How we detect and discover is what this is about and is so superior to what we normally encounter, you should watch it.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching. I must admit that this movie is one of the best I've ever seen I think only Brazil can match it. The first time i saw it was back in 98 and my impression of the movie was that it was disturbing thrilling and captivating but made no sense at all, and thus didn't care that much for it and forgot about it shortly after. Last year i saw Mulholland Dr. this movie didn't make that much sense to me either, but I ended up discussing it with one of my friends and together we made us some ideas of what and how the movie could make sense, during this discussion I mentioned lost highway and we decided to see it, but only after reading about the movie on various sites. WOW I was blown away. This most weird movie suddenly made sense, it still has that creepy disturbing feeling as a any film seen from an insane killers perspective should, but its a feeling that I embrace due to the brilliance of Lynch. This movie is quite surrealistic and its quite a job trying to figure out what is real and what is just a product of Fred Madison's dreams/imagination/distorted memories, just to and further complications Lynch made this movie far from linear. To round things of. If you see this movie and is not repulsed by the grim story the dark atmosphere and enjoy "thicker movies", then read of some guidelines for understanding pay much attention to the little details and start puzzling for your self. I still am, after having seen it several times.<br/><br/>10/10 for a great puzzle that just keeps getting better, and includes a naked Patricia Arquette naked (any mans dream). As much as I keep thinking about the content of 'Lost Highway', every time I watch it I'm so captivated by its style and atmosphere that I never really analyze what makes it work technically, nor do I have much of a desire to dissect it. Even so I know that it is a film-experience that very much feels unlike any other, with pretty simple frame compositions that focus on faces in front of monochrome walls or black nothingness and on intricate empty spaces alike, visually beautiful because the images are impactful, and a sound design that never lets up with what almost feels like wall-to-wall music.<br/><br/>So with 'Lost Highway' we have a wife killer who for legal purposes isn't named O.J. Simpson but Fred Madison. As he's awaiting execution in his prison cell he's plagued by guilt, crippling headaches and a lack of sleep so he receives a sleeping pill that doesn't appear to be too successful at helping him fall asleep but it certainly helps him to go places.<br/><br/>Fred takes a trip to wish fulfillment land where he is Pete, an attractive young lad with "half-biker, half-Beaver suburban parents" (thanks Donald Lyons) who don't forbid him to go out with his druggy friends at night but actually encourage him to do so. He's popular at work and talented at what he does. He has an influential friend who sticks up for him (preferably with a gun up somebody's butt) and a girlfriend who he is able to fully sexually please. And the sun is shining on him and on his next door neighbor's idyllic garden that unmistakably belongs to the poor guy who keeled over at the beginning of 'Blue Velvet' although except for the little family dog nobody seems to be at home.<br/><br/>Skip to "This Magic Moment" as Pete hooks up with Alice, his criminally influential friend's girlfriend who conveniently is the blonde spitting image of Renee, Fred's dead wife. After some fun times in cheap motel rooms Pete starts to question Alice's sincerity about really carrying about him, she comes off as calculating as she seemingly out of nowhere comes up with a murder plot that requires Pete's assistance with him getting to do the dirty job. It recalls the plot of 'Double Indemnity' while a lot of minor things ooze of 'Vertigo', from the dame's blonde doppelgänger to a floating head in a dream to policemen tailing an unfaithful guy as he "gets more pussy than a toilet seat", but those small similarities add up.<br/><br/>As the frame shakes and quakes from time to time and the image loses focus for a moment while the volume of the droning on the soundtrack fluctuates the dream gradually turns into a nightmare and the irony of it all is that Fred's fantasy-self eventually is the cause of his predicament for Pete ends up in the position of the guy who Fred's wife cheats on. After his elaborate trip of denial Fred probably understands this "other guy" better than ever but instead of this knowledge bringing about a catharsis it more and more makes his dream resemble the nightmare that his life has become.<br/><br/>This "loss of control" is where the highway from the opaque movie title comes into play. The two credit sequences show the view from a car as it drives on a highway at night while David Bowie sings "cruise me, blonde - cruise me, babe" sounding like he's falling into an abyss as he lets everybody know "I'm deranged". As much as this image is associated with Lynch's film this particular highway actually is only seen once as part of the story. It's when Pete and Alice drive out into the desert after she got him to kill Andy for some money. Now she tells Pete that they have to meet a friend of hers who lives in a 'Kiss Me Deadly' cabin in the desert. He wouldn't know what else to do and of course he loves her so he goes along with it. But Alice is taking him for the proverbial ride.<br/><br/>Fred thought he couldn't keep his wife in his own bed because he was a lousy lay, which was devastating enough for him to go mental on her and to cover their shared bedroom floor with her body parts like he was making his own little home movie adaption of the Black Dahlia case. But when Alice says to the stud Pete while having sex "You'll never have me" he makes a banally simple realization, a truth so basic that he can only hope to escape it by leaving wish fulfillment land behind and entering the world of his memories, the past as he remembers it, not necessarily how it happened. That truth is that woman isn't only flesh and bone and smooth skin but also soul, and unless maybe her name is Beyoncé woman isn't a thing that can be owned, not even if you like it and you put a ring on it.<br/><br/>As the fantasy-bubble bursts and Pete turns into Fred again without a change of location his mysterious friend already awaits him to put the Betacam on him once more provoking him to face facts by insisting to say to the camera what his "fücking name" is. But not all hope is lost quite yet, Fred still has enough delusion left in him to refabricate his memory making himself believe that he's prosecuted for taking revenge on the bastard who screwed his wife and making himself the sinister-voiced unknown who tells him that "Dick Laurent is dead" before the whole thing ever even started, a message that really tells him that it was all predestined to happen, that he's a victim of his own fate with him having no choice in the matter, that maybe Fred never even existed for he all along was a movie character stuck inside a film noir. The jazz saxophonist Fred Madison (Bill Pullman) is married with Renee (Patricia Arquette) and they live in a comfortable house. Fred is suspicious of the relationship of Renee with her friend Andy (Michael Massee). One morning, Renee finds a videotape on the doorstep of their house and when they watched the footage, they find that someone has broken in to film inside their house. They call the police, but the two detectives do not find any clue. Fred and Renee go to a party at Andy's house and Fred has a bizarre encounter with a mysterious man (Robert Blake) that tells him that they have met before and he is at Fred's house. The upset Fred calls Renee and they go back home. On the next morning, Fred finds another videotape and when he watches the film, he sees a bloodbath with Renee murdered in bed with him. He is found guilty of murder of first degree and sentenced to the electric chair. While waiting in the death row, he morphs into the efficient mechanic Peter Raymond Dayton (Balthazar Getty) and is released from the cell, but followed by two detectives. Pete fixes the car of the powerful and dangerous gangster Mr. Eddy (Robert Loggia) and when he meets his mistress Alice Wakefield (Patricia Arquette), they have a love affair and the woman convinces him to escape with her from Mr. Eddy and travel to some other place. <br/><br/>"Lost Highway" is one of the most intriguing, bizarre and challenging cult-movies that is to be loved or hated but never fully understood. I believe that even David Lynch that directed and wrote "Lost Highway" does not have answers for all the mysteries of the plot. The best and most provocative scene is when the mysterious man tells Fred that he is at his house and gives a cellular to Fred to call him. The film is shot following the style of film-noir and Patricia Arquette is the "femme fatale". The beauty of the half-naked Patricia Arquette is astonishing and her strip-tease is very erotic. The soundtrack with music of David Bowie, Angelo Badalamenti, Rammstein, Lou Reed, and Tom Jobim (with Insensatez") is spectacular. Last time I had watched this movie was on 23 December 1999. My vote is ten.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): "A Estrada Perdida" ("The Lost Highway") Among David Lynch's many bizarre and extraordinarily audacious works, one film stands out above them all - the one film I like of when I think of David Lynch: Lost Highway. Possibly the most underrated of all his films, and certainly one of the biggest cult hits.<br/><br/>The film stars Bill Pullman as a disturbed jazz saxophonist named Fred Madison, Patricia Arquette as both his mystical black-haired wife and Mr. Eddy's stunning blonde-haired girlfriend, Balthazar Getty as a young mechanic named Pete Dayton, Rogert Loggia as the powerful Mr. Eddy, and Robert Blake as the ever-so-creepy Mystery Man. The film also features some interesting cameos from Richard Pryor, Giovanni Ribisi, and Gary Busey as Pete's father.<br/><br/>The film flirts with such ideas as reincarnation and psychogenic fugue. Lost Highway was to be the first of what John David Ebert calls his "Los Angeles Trilogy," the second being Mulholland Drive and the third being Inland Empire. Although, I must admit Inland Empire is probably the strangest and most unsolvable of the "Trilogy," and possibly of all his films, ever.<br/><br/>Lost Highway, I found, was his most well-written work. He seemed to dissect subject matter which hadn't even been seen on film before. The idea of somebody recreating their life in their own imagination upon the realization of their reality. Some may disagree, suggesting many other interpretations, or stating that that idea had been done before. Well, I must say that it has never been done this way. This film was the start of an original and trademark style of Lynch's, the style which would make his films recognizable based merely on the use of camera-work and lighting.<br/><br/>With Lost Highway, Lynch reinvented the usual film narrative in a way which put the viewer directly into the driver's seat of a delusional and/or unstable mind. In this case, Fred Madison's. Slavoj iek noted Lynch's prominent use of exploiting "the opposite of two horrors." Lost Highway does this by observing the mystical, and noir-ish dream-land versus our much more disturbing everyday life of alienation and deceit. Lynch takes refuge on this technique in both Mulholland Drive, and Inland Empire.<br/><br/>I don't much listen to what most professional critics have to say about a film because, frankly, they're opinions aren't usually the smartest or well-guided out there. Take any film from Stanley Kubrick, for example. It's much more fun for a film-goer to discover cult films like Lost Highway, than stick with the same Casablanca-esquire formula you'll find in most critic favorites. And in the words of Robert Blake -- It's been a pleasure talking to you. This was my first encounter with David Lynch. I fell in love.
The atmosphere in this movie in incredible, it aspires you in a whole different dimension, where time and space lose their meaning. Everything in here plays with your mind and your senses, to the point where you finally abandon yourself to the current of this movie.
Great acting, deep dialogues, crazy photography. As for the scenario, well it definitely exists. Or not. Or closer to the truth, you should choose your own scenario. Because when reality fails you, imagination remains, and it becomes your only anchor. So let your brain lose, for this is not about logic. It is about broken minds and lost souls. Someone said that Lynch has said that Fred was a schizophrenic murderer. Well yes, he either killed or had Dick Laurent killed. I don't believe he killed his wife. We see the evil mobster Mr.Eddy showing snuff films in his house where someone apparently is murdered in it on the TV screen. Which seems to represent true images. Why not just porno, of course it makes Eddy look more menacing but is that necessary? Showing the snuff film is not an accident, it is necessary to the plot. We see Arquette with the mobster watching the snuff film on the TV late in the film. She makes films for a guy she knows kills people on film, she is embracing him and letting him have his way with her We never actually see Fred murder his wife. In fact Fred in the video before he is punched by the police Fred clearly has no weapon in his hand and is in shock. Why leave the weapon out of the video if Fred killed his wife? Given the people she was in with why isn't it a possibility that unbeknownst to her she was put in a snuff film, murdered, and then brought back to her house so as to frame the murder on Fred? Fred comes home sees the body and could have very well been forced to play in the gore by whoever was behind the camera. Tape ends up with the police, case closed. <br/><br/>As far as Fred as a man he is obviously not a big time musician, he is playing in a small club. The house he and his wife share is a multi-million dollar house there is no way Fred could afford that kind of house on what he makes. <br/><br/>So he marries a woman who has a multi-million dollar house and doesn't know what she does for a living?(heck it might even be Eddys house that would explain the horrible vibe in the house) No way. The laugh they share at the beginning of the film when Arquette says she is going to 'read' when he is out tells us all. So out of the window goes the explanation that Fred and his happy wife were plodding along and suddenly he discovers she is in porno and kills his wife, Andy, and Eddy. He had to have known she was in porno and aligned with Andy and Eddy, million dollar houses don't grow on trees. <br/><br/>That also explains why the satanic character in the film tells Fred: 'You invited me into your house, it is not my custom to go where I'm not wanted'. He invited evil into his house by living with the knowledge that his wife was a professional whore, and associated with wholly evil men. This analysis is also backed up by the fact that Fred sees the mystery man/satanic character briefly imposed on his wife's face. This sends a clear message and clearly explains how he got 'into the house' it was through Fred's wife and her evil conduct.<br/><br/>Fred lived with his wife day in and day out with some childish notion he could 'save' her from her degraded life.(which is represented by the way the naieve Pete character treats her) When it was in fact her choice to live it, and in fact Fred benefited greatly from that life materially. He had cars, million dollar house, nice clothes, status. So really his romantic notion to save his wife was self-deception. Fred liked the life his wife's evil afforded him.<br/><br/>However at some point he found out that his wife was in snuff films where people got killed. Instead of at this point realizing the total and complete degradation of his wife and leaving her. He hangs onto his fantasy image of his wife being forced into participating. Blames Laurent, and has him killed.<br/><br/>Killing Laurent sets up the horrific chain of events. Laurents partner in crime, the sleazy guy at the party finds out about Fred's hit on Laurent. Which is shown in the film at the party, we see the instant where it becomes known to the sleazy guy that Fred had something to do with the death of Laurent. <br/><br/>The sleazy guy is the one responsible for the videotapes that get the police involved. If hes not why have the long setup with the series of videotapes? He is the one who kills Freds wife to set Fred up. They probably even force Fred to play in the gore while they tape it as an added punishment.<br/><br/>The film is incredible it really shows the type of person that lives a life like Fred. Fred is utterly human, and I think anyone who tries to write him off as 'mentally ill' would have trouble doing so. After watching the film one must admit there's a little bit of Fred in all of us.(some more than others :) I've never rated a movie before but I felt that this movie had such high reviews, contrary to what i took away from it, I had to say my bit. No offense to those who loved it (you are welcome to your opinion) but I HATED this movie. I feel I've seen a lot of crappy movies but this one shames them all. I read a great review on IMDb so decided to watch it...I think it quoted Homer Simpson saying something like "Brilliant, I don't get it." Well I didn't get it either and I did not find it brilliant. It was like one excuse after another to see tits, sex and gore...I could rent a porno for that. I kept waiting for it to get interesting but, to me, it was just a drawn out acid trip that I should have turned off the first time I felt like doing so. I make no secret about David Lynch being my favourite ever director. He makes films like no other by building dark worlds which draw you in by putting you in some sort of spell. I love him so much that I put off seeing Lost Highway for over a year because it was the only David Lynch film I was yet to see. I was even considering not seeing it at all just so I could always have that one new David Lynch film, but then I thought that would just be ridiculous. Also, the revival of Twin Peaks was enough to pique my David Lynch anticipation meter to breaking point so I finally gave in and stuck in Lost Highway.<br/><br/>Firstly, I don't think it's as grossly strange as some people make out. Yes, it has all the trademark bizarreness you come to expect from David but the majority of the film is surprisingly linear. I was expecting some next level INLAND EMPIRE stuff the way some folk bang on about it! The first 40 minutes are like Michael Haneke's Hidden in dream form. It's probably some of the best stuff our David has ever done due to the inexplicably tense and hellish atmosphere. A lot of the scariness is down to the terrifying music which ranges to ominous drones to extremely loud strings. There's one seriously nightmarish image near the start (which I've never heard anyone talk about, surprisingly) which sent chills up my spine. It's a full-on Lynchian assault on the senses which takes you down some dark and enthralling corners. The atmosphere is chock-a-block full of mystery.<br/><br/>There are endlessly beautiful scenes including Fred playing the saxophone, the unsettling meeting with the Mystery Man and extremely frightening dream sequences. I think it's also important to note the expert positions David places the camera. There always seems to be too much space surrounding the characters and it makes for seriously eerie viewing. There's also that fantastic Francis Bacon inspired colour scheme of dark purples/pinks and shadows. He really does direct the hell out of the first forty minutes of this film.<br/><br/>Suddenly the film changes into something entirely different as soon as Fred Madison randomly transforms into a young mechanic called Pete Dayton and takes on an entirely new life. No one seems to bat an eyelid about Fred Madison disappearing and the sudden change is quite jarring. In my opinion, this is when the film goes down a gear. I think because the first story is so strong, this second one pales slightly in comparison as the suffocating atmosphere somewhat dissipates and the overall strangeness ceases. Don't get me wrong, there's still a lot to love it just feels less Lynchy and more straightforward, and the Pete Dayton story is the biggest chunk of the film.<br/><br/>There are still some spectacular sequences though, including a mysterious gangster getting road rage and Patricia Arquette's intriguing Alice character. There's also a strong feeling of everything not quite being what it seems and it gives you time to ponder over exactly what the heck you're watching. Thankfully for us weirdos things do start to get extremely strange towards the final half hour of the film before breaking down into total chaos until your mind finally explodes.<br/><br/>Lost Highway is extremely puzzling in a similar way to Mulholland Dive. All of the clues seem to be there as well as a few abstractions to throw lots of spanners into the works (what does this Mystery Man have to do with it all!?) but there is a complex and very intelligent story buried underneath all the bizarreness. It feels like a warm-up exercise before Dave finally broke the mould of film with Mulholland Drive. Everything in Mulholland feels like a perfected version of Lost Highway from the more passionate love story to the unrelenting dreamlike atmosphere.<br/><br/>Lost Highway is still a film to cherish on the Lynchian canon though. It's very much its own thing and I felt a strong urge to see it all again once it had all finished. Unlike Mulholland Drive there doesn't seem to be a universal theory to Lost Highway which makes it all the more interesting to watch again and again to dig for clues. However, as with all Lynchy films the best thing to do is just sit back and let your intuition drive you rather than your brain. It's not an IQ test but a piece of art which is designed to take you on a journey. No one makes films that make you feel quite like David Lynch does. Let's hope that the Twin Peaks revival encourages our Dave to get back into more regular filmmaking again. I couldn't bear to wait another ten years! The trend these days seems to view anything "artsy" and weird as great stuff. If it's weird than there MUST be some cosmic hidden meaning....yeah, right. This movie is not only horrible, it isn't even artsy. Weird doesn't adequately describe it. It is the most disconnected, indecipherable, incomprehensible movie I've ever seen. No plot. Period. I don't think there were 5 consecutive minutes that were related, much less made sense. If there is some "deeper" meaning behind this junk then it sure is lost. If you're a psychopath in a mental ward maybe you can make sense of it - even then I doubt it. The only reason I watched it is because I was on the treadmill while the station was on and didn't feel like changing the channel. Do yourself a favor. Don't waste your time unless you want to be shaking your head for 2 and a half hours wondering what the hell this is all about. Horrible. There, that title alone is enough to get fans to cringe and generate torrents of seething hatred now. This film is a Lynch film, it is therefor a mystery/crime with a very strong emphasis on the mystery...and the crime. But in both cases, an extreme version. So extreme in fact is the mystery, that it never actually unravels its coherent meaning, for simply, there is none. This sounds all very seductive to the pseudo-intellectual, but for others this comes across as clearly lacking a coherence even within the incoherence, an order in the chaos attempted. This comes across as way, way too many sex scenes, unnecessary violence to cover up strong plot work, easily too much length, and ultimately an artist abusing his status in creating lazy and complacent pudding: it's sweet, it looks good, but it's amorphic. Shape cannot entirely replace content, and if the content is to be this sort of fantastic network of vistas and concepts then it should at least provide a certain understanding to its public, some light along the dark alley. <br/><br/>Lost Highway is interesting visually, pretty enjoyable to watch, but it really doesn't amount to anything of any valuable quality when it comes to an actual resolution of the plot and never provides the fullness in meaning, the satisfaction of understanding the whole. This film may have a compelling, abstract narrative to start with but it becomes so very self-indulgent towards about the last third, and it just goes on and on and on... Sincerely not a great film. Not as well made as 'Blue Velvet', to give an example, made a decade earlier. 5/10. this is truly a classic. the entire film can be read on several different levels; literally, a bit deeper, and the significance of that deeper level.<br/><br/>currently i've only just been able to get under the surface. let me be the first to tell you: beyond the surreal atmosphere and the best lit sex scenes of all time is something very interesting going on.<br/><br/>i won't spoil this for you, as it wasn't spoiled for me when i first had the pleasure of watching it. i would agree that the widescreen version is the way to go, but either will do.<br/><br/>do not watch this film if you are not interested in thinking about it. it was produced to be thought about. it is more than just surreality and chaos, but only if you let it be. keep an open mind about it and expect nothing but the best from the master of the bizarre.<br/><br/>david lynch, i am in your debt. Fred Madison (Bill Pullman) is told that "Dick Laurent is dead". He plays the saxophone. He and his wife Renée (Patricia Arquette) are hounded by someone unknown. A mystery man, supposed to be a friend of Dick Laurent, meets Fred at a party. Fred is jailed for brutally murdering Renée. In prison, his identity changes to Pete Dayton (Balthazar Getty). Pete is released for being the wrong guy. Sheila (Natasha Gregson Wagner) is his girlfriend. He's a mechanic working at a garage owned by Arnie (Richard Pryor). Gangster Mr. Eddy (Robert Loggia) needs his car repaired and Alice Wakefield (Patricia Arquette) is his mistress.<br/><br/>David Lynch has made something confusing. Following this logically may be a fool's errant. The problem is that it's not terribly compelling either. It grinds along like a car stuck in first gear. It is impossibly slow with an unknowable story. When the switch happens, the movie goes into a WTF restart. I'm not sure I care about the first part. At least, the second part has the great Robert Loggia. Lost Highway is a film that can be perceived on many levels. There is some truth to the claims that it is film that musy be FELT. This is Lynches most painterly film to date, working heavily with textures and experimental camera techniques. It is a film that can indeed be appreciated on a purely aesthetic level. However, this is not to say that the film is without meaning or that it cannot be understood. There are many theories to the true meaning of Lost Highway, some of which are easier to back up than others. Certainly this the first time that Lynch has truly entered into the mind of an entity, and the film deals with different levels of consciousness and perception. It is also concerned with voyeurism and the medium of film itself.<br/><br/>But hey, go see it for yourself, see it more than once, work out your own theories. Certainly, the film must be seen in a cinema and requires more than one viewing. It is a film that requires concentration, time, deep thought. Given those things, it will soon become clear that this is the most complex and fully realised motion picture of the decade.<br/><br/>Lost Highway IS Life. I was actually right on top of the action every step of the way in this film. But you have to have an understanding of the dream experience, particularly falling into such an intense sleep that you actually dream you fall asleep and have another dream INSIDE your dream in order to understand what's going on. This is what happened to Fred. I remember having two such dream experiences before. If I hadn't I probably would've been quite confused watching Lost Highway. I'm pretty sure this is what David Lynch portrayed here.<br/><br/>Fred is basically a homicidal maniac so whacked out of his mind on drugs that he is not conscious to committing these murders. In prison he goes through such severe narcotics withdrawal that he's given a powerful sedative, after which he falls into a deep, intense sleep and dream sequence. In the dream he is Pete, Fred when he is younger. Pete represents Fred's wish to break out of prison, and the sedative is so powerful Fred dreams Pete falls asleep and has a dream inside of Fred's dream. That's why there is so much wish-fulfillment going on in the last half of this movie (killing Mr. Eddy, Renee's betrayal e.g.) Pete's dream begins the morning he returns to work and his employer is Richard Pryor, the most bizarre casting call I've ever seen. But if you've had the experience of dreaming about celebrities being casual acquaintances, you understand. You know when Pete wakes up from his dream inside Fred's dream when B. Getty turns back into Bill Pullman. This is the most crucial scene to understanding what's going on in the film.<br/><br/>The last hour of the movie is displaced. Chronologically it takes place after the doctor gives Fred the sedative, and before he wakes up in his cell and bangs himself to death on the floor. Fred wakes up after the final scene when he's being chased by a phalanx of police cars. He's having a seizure in the driver's seat, the final scene in the movie. I actually let out a yawp watching this, patting myself on the back when I predicted the movie was over, and it was. Because I kept telling myself during the final 20 minutes, "Fred HAS to wake up from this eventually." The next scene chronologically (instead of the closing credits) is Fred waking up in the middle of the film on the floor of his cell.<br/><br/>Definitely one of the most brilliant productions I've ever seen, and my favorite David Lynch film of all time. I see there's a couple of smartasses writing these comments writing stuff like " uh its not art or anything"  well you try  making a movie like that. Maybe it doesn't make any sense, maybe it's not supposed to, maybe Lynch is just making fun of us and having a good time watching the critics trying to figure out what it's about. But don't tell me that it doesn't take any skill to make a movie like that. I bet most of the hollywood directors wouldn't be able to make a movie like that "Lost Highway" is an unbelievably awful film (and believe me, being a B-movie junkie, I've seen some pretty bad films) that pretends to be an art house film.  Well, I've got news for you, art house films have more substance than "Lost Highway"'s contrived drivel.  Lynch made the huge mistake letting his images tell the story (which, I have no problem with unless the imagery lacks creativity and skill, which this film does).  As a whole, the way most of the scenes were shot were pedestrian at best.  On most accounts, Lynch failed at letting his images do the "talking".  I absolutely adore dark films that have a penchant for being weird and offbeat, but Lynch can't even manage that. In "Lost Highway", he uses forced artfulness.  Compositions of dialogue and images cease to be artful when they're crammed down the throats of the viewers, which was exactly what Lynch did here.  Everything about this film is so claustrophobic that it denies the viewers of their freedom to interpret what they're seeing on screen in their own way (which is the worst thing a director can do).  The lack of coherence was not one of the many main gripes I had with this film; the pacing was.  The pacing of "Lost Highway" was wrought out so much to the point that it was torturous.  And those damn pauses in between dialogue, and even in between words in sentences of dialogue drove me up a wall.  There were, literally, at least three occasions where there were twenty second pauses in between exchanges of dialogue between characters, and one where some moronic blond girl that has no self-worth (the movie was so mind-boglingly lumbering, I can't even remember her name) takes a twenty second pause (in the middle of a freakin' sentence!) while talking to some ugly young man (I can't remember his name, either, nor care to) while they are driving.  I guess Lynch thought that this film would be more true to life (or at least pretend to give it some sense of realism, which it doesn't) if he had his actors take those long pauses, but again, he made another huge miscalculation: people in real life do not talk like that!  If anything, people talk too fast, not too slow.  The only characters that were memorable were Bill Pullman's character Fred (but this performance left much to be desired), and the creepy man with the video camera (too bad he wasn't in the movie for longer).<br/><br/>My rating: 1 out of ten.<br/><br/>*Side note:  "Lost Highway" rivals "Castle Freak" for worst film I've ever seen.  And guess what, we have a new winner!  Yes, that's right, "Lost Highway" is my new least favourite film.   At least "Castle Freak" had one redeeming quality in it: the amazing Jeffrey Combs who delivered a decent performance despite one of the worst plots I've ever seen in my life (excluding the attempted one in "Lost Highway"). This has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen.<br/><br/>I made myself sit through it and watch it until the end in the hopes that it would connect and make some sense.<br/><br/>Alas, it did not.<br/><br/>I would not wish this movie on anyone.<br/><br/>The movie is all over the place and never comes together or makes sense.<br/><br/>I have heard the theories, had discussions, etc... and I keep reading about the genius of Lynch but I have to strongly disagree. I could make a better movie because my movie... although being a bit out there, would make sense. I think he ran out of time and just created an ending that he felt like.<br/><br/>Don't see this movie... you will regret that you did. Just about everything about this movie is weird but in a awesome stylish way! Patrica Arquette stunningly gorgeous with a few provocative scenes! This is one of the greatest art house films; felt like it'd be better to watch at night, still great anytime of the day. David Lynch's tone in all his projects are like a perfect tapestry pouring out of his mind and the cinematographer's. I haven't read the other reviews...i'm sure lots of them try and explain what 'this movie is about'. they should become psychoanalysts...i'm pretty sure if we asked LYNCH 'what it was about', he'd say, 'beats me'. it's as if had storyboarded a dream...and it's something to experience...robert blake playing 'the midget'. a character lynch seems to employ in lots of his work, was fantastic...plus i hadn't seen him in anything in quite a while...
i saw this film for the second time last night, thinking it might make more sense... and what i realized is that some stories impact me viscerally and are every bit as valid as the ones that 'make sense'. I've rated probably one thousand movies or more here at imdb, but "lost highway" is the first one i give a 1/10 to.  This movie, if you can call it a movie, sucks.  Don't plan to watch it and be entertained...the color bars on your tv has a better plot.  This film is just artsy-fartsy rubbish. The way I see this film--and it may not be original or new to anyone, if not, I apologize--is that it should be understood, at least partly, as a film noir movie, and that the "message" (if there is one) or intent of Lynch is to comment on the modern psyche through the film noir genre. <br/><br/>The elements of film noir are these: a man who is innocent of all wrong, finds himself in an inescapable situation in which he is pointed out as a culprit/criminal. He is helpless not only in wrenching free of the circumstances (usually he is set up by someone), but is quite in the dark as to how he arrived in the center of the mess in the first place. Another element is that the man is usually used by a woman.<br/><br/>All of these fit in with "Lost Highway". The Bill Pullman character definitely finds himself in bizarre relationship with his wife (played by Patricia Arquette), receives strange videos of someone entering his house, and then showing him murdering his wife. His character is completely innocent from the audience's point of view. In some supernatural, nonlinear way that must involve some kind of time warp, he is fingered as his wife's assassin and jailed for it. And you can't help think that his wife is somehow in on it.<br/><br/>When the transformation into the Balthazar Getty character happens, it is Balthazar's turn to meet another woman (played, not by accident, by Patricia Arquette)who then seduces him and uses him to escape her relationship with her mobster boyfriend. The Getty character is unaware that he is being used, although comes to some realization that she's not as innocent as she seems.<br/><br/>In the end, when the Getty character transforms back into the Pullman character, you realize, a little at least, why the two are connected. They, perhaps, are connected because they represent the fact that finding oneself helpless, framed, and convicted (at least on one level), is a universal phenomenon, not just one meant to tell a story.<br/><br/>When Pullman, running from the cops, stops by his own house to warn himself via intercom of his future--that's really a nice touch, and makes your hair stand on end. The self trying eternally to reach back and save itself (or something like that).<br/><br/>And then, when he's driving down the Lost Highway, it's really spooky because you don't know whether it is a highway to redemption or a useless attempt to escape the inescapable.<br/><br/>It's such a great movie, and a million things could be said about it on so many different levels. Lynch's creepiness, and his use of the other-worldly elements really make the movie. To me, Lynch is the best American director alive. Jarmusch, Scorsese et al are fine, but they've yet to produce the kind of complexity of form and transcendence of vision that Lynch has achieved. Have you never wanted to kill? An intense artist, a cuckhold, an inadequate, aware of his wife's history and infidelities, and his own failings, turns the corner.<br/><br/>The souless apartment they inhabit is unloved. The gap between need and satisfaction is breached only by increasingly voyeuristic and violent paranoia. A videotape of the apartment exterior arrives, someone is watching. In a second tape, the observer ventures further. The camera films them sleeping. A disastrous party, wife drunk in another man's arms, an encounter with a dark force at the bar. Disturbed sleep. A third tape in the morning shows the cold, murderous fact.<br/><br/>Some history can't be redescribed. You can try to justify a terrible crime in fantasy if you wish, but the truth is inescapable. Dear reader.<br/><br/>First of all, I must say that my review is more like a discussion and it's meant for those who saw the movie rather then those who didn't. So if you didn't see Lost Highway, and just reading the reviews in order to decide whether to watch it or not, then I'll only repeat others in saying that this is a masterpiece in every aspect. It has one of the best cinematography ever, amazing soundtrack and a superb cast. An unforgettable movie, one of those, people like spending time to talk about. Well I guess that my rating already speaks for itself.<br/><br/>Now, a discussion for those who saw the movie.<br/><br/>Lost Highway begins with Fred getting a message that "Dick Laurent is Dead", hearing the sirens of the police vehicles. The movie ends in the same tune, with Fred leaving this message and running from the police. Which one of these scenes happened? Maybe both of them are elaborations of Fred's mind?<br/><br/>At the beginning of the movie, Fred said to us as a clue, that he remembers things not exactly the way they happened. This is exactly what we are shown. A collection of scenes without a particular order, while some of them are real and others are not. The whole plot of this movie still remains a mystery to me, though some parts of the puzzle could be placed. <br/><br/>First of all, there's a general consensus that Fred killed his wife. It's unknown whether he did it himself, or hired someone else to do the job, but he's sentenced for that crime to death. While awaiting the execution his mind elaborates an illusion / dream where he manages to escape his death. This is the catharsis, where Fred is haunted by what he's done.<br/><br/>The second part, where Pete is the main character, is clearly an illusionary one from start to end. Nothing in it seems rational. Here are some of the things that make it obvious: 1) Peter doesn't know why he is in prison ( because it seems to be a dream ), apparently he doesn't really have a reason to be there, so he is released. 2) Peter's parents showing little interest in what is going on in Peter's life. They just sit still in their house, watching T.V. and not interfering in his life. 3) The girls in this part are seems to be crazy about Peter. And he satisfies them - which is contrary to his real life, where he is not much of a lover to his wife. This is how he would like to be 4) When Eddy takes Pete for a ride - he does this for no particular reason ( as in our dreams we do things without a reason ). 5) The ride itself is highly fictional. Starting with the part when Pete fixes Eddy's car ( what does he do there). Continuing with the driver in the white car that Eddy's Mercedes hits. When Eddy looks in the front mirror of the car he sees the driver in the right seat, but when the driver passes the Mercedes and shows Eddy "the finger" he is sitting on the left side of his car. The crash itself is very unlikely either. 6) When Alice tells Peter how she met Eddy. She was forced to undress. 7) The hallway in Andy's mansion is the same as the hallway in the Lost Highway Hotel shown to us near the end.<br/><br/>Some scenes from the first and the third parts ( by parts in this movie i mean to the sequence of scenes between two adjacent shots of moving highway ) are imaginary also. Like Fred's running from the police at the end of the movie, but in fact he's not going anywhere, he's in prison. What I think is real in the movie, is the scene of police in Andy's place. Why? Because it is the only scene where Fred (or Pete) is not participating. In this scene we have a mention of Peter Dayton, Fred's wife, Dick Laurent and a coincidence between the murder cases. Maybe ( purely a theory ) Peter Dayton is the one who has been hired to kill Andy and Dick Laurent...<br/><br/>Lost Highway resembles in many ways Lynche's other work, but still remains original and adds something new. There are the dark corridor, the red curtain, the fade in / fade out change of scenes etc. To me Lost Highway and Mullholland Drive are David Lynche's best movies I've seen ( but not the only that are good ), where Mullholand Drive is slightly better being less cryptic and having a solid logical solution to it. I have a theory . David Lynch is obviously crazy . I don't mean " Oh what a Crazy guy . " I mean he's really truly insane . I recently saw an interview with him and it was all too apparent .<br/><br/>So , here's what I think . They were ready to toss him in the booby - hatch and he tried to convince them he wasn't insane even after they had seen some of his movies . So he did " Straight Story " to convince the guys in white jackets that he was mentally competent . Long story short - " Straight Story " convinced the guys in white jackets that he wasn't as nuts as they thought . So he dodged the loony bin and went back to making nutbag movies . See " Lost Highway " or " Mulholland Drive " if you doubt me .<br/><br/>Anyway , they should grab him up again before he makes more of these totally incomprehensible , unconnected , disjointed and totally worthless movies again . This was the second Lynch picture I ever saw, the first being Dune. It blew my mind. I remember walking away from it reeling about how it captured the sheer madness of existence. We wander around all our lives, sometimes in horrible situations right from the beginning, not really knowing what is going on in the big picture, without seemingly having had a choice in the matter. This aspect of the mysterious horror of life is portrayed in sublime fashion in Lost Highway. The persecution by the Mystery Man...the ultimately unatainable yet intoxicating persona of Patricia Arquette...it makes you wonder, do these people deserve what they are going through? Are they being punished for transgressions in another life? Is there any sense to all this madness? Is it all just a sick game by some sadistic omniscient power we never see? These questions could be asked about both the film and life itself. The key to this movie is to simply experience it, and not try to understand it, as, like existence itself, it is fundamentally impossible to comprehend in the bigger sense. Some of them women have a darker side,and no matter how dark it is,some men will do anything to keep them on their side.I think it's the Marilyn Manson cover on the soundtrack expressing it the best:i put a spell on you,because you're mine-even tough i can't stand the things you do. It's a darker side of love,some kind of an everlasting hunger,can't be satisfied. Lynch cached that feeling very well,with 100% emotion and professionally made. A masterpiece-as usually. Lynch is my favorite director and filmmaker,his films are living. I know i'm a "bit" subjective,and i'm proud of it.You need to feel his works,and then you'll understand them.And the soundtrack makes it even better,but no,it is the very part of the film,professionally chosen here again. Crazy love. I just returned from a screening of this (it was double-featured with "Wild At Heart" at a local vintage theater). I've lost count of how many times I have watched this film and been mesmerized by it in new and different ways each and every time, and this time was no exception -- seeing it on a big screen with a proper sound system and a proper audience revealed many bits that I had not thought about upon previous viewings and, given the opportunity, I would recommend everyone else reading this do the same (regardless of whether you liked, disliked, were just confused by, or haven't seen it at all).<br/><br/>I should mention that David Lynch is not my favorite director, and I am not some Lynch fanatic who gobbles up every last drop of pretentious nonsense the guy will drip. I think his "Dumbland" series is pretty much worthless, I think "Mulholland Dr." is a numbingly 'over-directed' film whose content is simply too exaggerated and ridiculous to take seriously from any perspective, and I think he as a person -- while certainly having his charming whimsical moments -- is far too hoity-toity about his own work and doesn't give his fans enough credit for me to thoroughly respect him as an artist. And I do not have high expectations for "Inland Empire".<br/><br/>However "Lost Highway" is a perfect example of why I always come back to him. It is the perfect measure of his potential for crafting a lean, polished film that yields just the right balance of surreal and pragmatic content, and with just the right amount of subtle (and not-so-subtle) dark humor and "entertainment devices" to make it watchable in any number of mental states (passive, engaged, stoned, hung-over...). A significant part of the reason I love watching movies is for the temporary aura they drown you in -- most directors are more comfortable with letting the narrative carry that aura, but few are comfortable with letting the aura carry the narrative, and that is precisely what this film effortlessly does. And while the film unabashedly acknowledges its indebtedness to the conventions of the mystery genre, it completely subverts all of those conventions by assigning the role of "detective" to the audience (rather than to a character in the film), effectively making the "clues" cinematic (rather than concrete) in nature -- and thus the abstractions in the narrative become a way of paying homage to the genre rather than a way of deconstructing or criticizing it. As odd as it may sound, this film is most certainly a celebration of rather common cinematic conventions, as every last frame is crammed with them -- they're just deployed in a very surprising way, which is precisely where the film's brilliance lies. I know I'm probably not the only one who's said it, but I'll echo: seeing this movie once is simply not enough. As a stand-alone piece of cinematic art, it simply demands that you drop whatever pretensions you have with David Lynch the auteur and engage it upon its own terms.<br/><br/>...As a side note, I have to mention that my favorite line in the film has to be the only line uttered by one of Mr. Eddy's henchmen during the scene with the tailgater, spoken rather quietly while Mr. Eddy is screaming at the top of his lungs: "Tell him you won't tailgate." You might not even notice it the first time, it's just so oddly placed. Something about the delivery......... I just watched this and ... damnation. What a film! One thing I love about David Lynch is that, while some of his obsessions (thematic and visual) appear over and over again in his films, he doesn't seem to repeat himself or to be in a rut (as opposed to an artist like, say, Laurie Anderson, who I think made her best statements in the 70s and has been doing the same thing ever since).<br/><br/>Lost Highway features some of the same elements as the later _Mulholland Drive_: the structure that "turns itself inside out," the blonde vs. brunette woman thing ... you'll even notice the trademark red curtains (familiar from M.D. and also _Twin Peaks_) and the white picket fences of _Blue Velvet_.<br/><br/>But there is much here that is unfamiliar and completely terrifying. I'd go so far as to say that David Lynch is the only effective director of the horror film that we have. I just posted a comment on the lousy 1999 remake of William Castle's _House on Haunted Hill_ & lamented there what I saw as Hollywood's complete inability to frighten anyone, any more. I take it back ... in a way. Of course, _Lost Highway_ is not a "genre" horror film, but ... is there anything in _House on Haunted Hill_ that is as terrifying as Robert Blake is in this movie? Not to me.<br/><br/>I may be posting prematurely, since I just finished watching this film for the first time and am still sort of flushed with it. I highly recommend that people who love good film see this one again and again. The plot was confusing to say the least, but the cinamatography was excellent. It was often frantic, dreamy, disturbing, it even acheived a tarentino-esque quality at one piont. In my mind this was much better than blue velvet. The camerawork and effects were the most haunting I have ever seen. This is a must see for any film buff or aspiring director. all I can say is...wow! The best Lynch film since "Eraserhead." If you watch this expecting for it to make any sense on a logical level, forget it. It makes sense the way dreams make sense--the only way to watch it is with your right brain. You can't "think" about it, you have to "feel" it. The closest thing to a dream experience I have ever seen except for "Eraserhead." Extremely eerie, especially the music and the spooky/funny Mystery Man. Just as in a dream, people inexplicably turn into other people, or one person is really two people, shadows and strange angles abound, and the most mundane comments can send chills down your spine. When the mystery man appears to Fred and says to him, "I'm in your house right now. Call me" my heart just stopped. One other thing worth mentioning: to fully appreciate Lynch's genius, this movie must be seen more than once. It makes a lot more "sense" (if you can use that word) the second or third time. A must-see for Lynch fans and those who like psychological horror. A movie that, like a bad dream, is hard to shake off. As a rule I like David Lynch films,I have seen all of them except Eraserhead.My favorite is Blue Velvet. I did not like this movie at all. I have a 3 digit IQ and I like movies that make you think-but this movie made no sense at all. I don't have to worry about being a "spoiler" on this one because I don't know what it was about. Plot-well if there was one it escaped me,because the various elements of the film never came together. Even a nightmare has a kind of surreal,linear logic this movie did not. Robert Blake was scarier than an audit notice from the IRS but even his role is unclear. I thought he was a supernatural being, but he pulls a gun and shoots another character in the movie. I would think a being that can be in 2 places at the same time could think of a more imaginative way to dispatch someone. I'm just glad I didn't plunk down any loot to see this movie--awful is too kind a word for it. oh, the thought this film provoked (for me anyways)! i was attracted to the box cover, then fell in love with every frame as i watched the story unfold. this film intrigues, inspires, CONFUSES, seduces, and fascinates me with each time i watch it. i still have no idea what the hell is happening, or how to comprehend it, but still i can't stop myself from watching it over and over. David lynch is the antitheses of a directoral hero, which in a way makes him heroic (i mean, who else could come up with this wacky s**t??) he respects and exploits his actors in the most unconventional ways. i look forward to his future masterpieces, but no matter how good they are, they'll pale in comparison to Lost Highway....for me, anyways. David Lynch is one of the few directors that have managed to sustain a niche audience for his movies. His perception of movie making and how he views the world was very evident from his debut "Eraserhead". Many critics have questioned his style and some have not been convinced also. Many people refer to him as the master of mystery and horror. However a majority of his features have dwelled more in to the mind of the individual rather than presenting a linear story. It has not been his style to present everything understandably. To confuse the viewer and raise questions has been his speciality. Each one of his movies have been different to each other. But the common factor has always existed, character driven. One element that has been very repetitive in his movies is 'black comedy'. This theme he manages to beautifully blend with mystery and horror. I admire his obsession with the mystical world and surrealism. He really has the ability to depict all this in a convincing and believable manner. He is a director to be reckoned with. One would have hoped that he would make movies more occasionally. In recent interviews Mr Lynch has commented on saying that he draws inspiration from dreams and nightmares that he has. This is easy to relate to and this is transcended to the screen. Many of the mystery elements that pervade in his movies have never been explained by him. But he is an artist and I feel that as a movie viewer one should admire and appreciate his work as a piece of art or a painting rather than attempting to decipher and unravelling it.<br/><br/>Lost Highway is one of his movies that I highly regard as having cult status. It may well be in the archives for being the most complicated movie to understand. However I doubt it could hold a candle to the recent "Inception". It is presented in a mobius strip format where the beginning comes back in full circle. The noir elements very much exist in every form and character, right from the Patricia Arquette's femme fatale wife to Robert Loggia as the gangster. David Lynch used his own residence in the first 40 minutes. It may have saved on production costs but the setting was appropriate for mysterious environment. Initially we feel that we are about to watch a movie about a couple trying to discover who is sending them videotapes with the footage of their house. But this leads to more suspense and mystery after the wife is murdered. And the movie takes a totally different turn. The movie could have turned in to a murder mystery, but Lynch cleverly averts that. Barry Gifford supported Lynch on the script and has presented a fabulous outcome. A simple plot has been presented in a complicated manner. Every scene mystifies and raises questions to the point that it feels difficult to digest. Lynch once stated that O.J Simpson's murder trail inspired him to make this movie. To what extent that is true, I could not say.<br/><br/>SPOILERS Fred Madison and Renee are couple that live together who seem to have secrets that are hidden from each other. Fred doubts Renee about what she may be doing in her free time meanwhile Renee acts very mysteriously. One morning Renee picks up a video tape from the door step. They watch it together and there is a footage of the exterior of their residence. Later that night after a miserable session of attempted sex, Fred begins to doubt Renee even more as she sympathises with him. The next morning they receive another tape. This time it shows footage of them the couple sleeping together. This immediately become a concern to them and they contact the authorities. Two detectives arrive and after inspecting the residence fail to find any signs of forced entry. The same night at a party of Renee's friend Andy, a mysterious short man calls Fred's house and surprisingly he himself answers. The couple return back home to find nothing. Fred is then arrested and given the death sentence for Renee's murder. He however does not recall anything. After complaining of headaches his identity changes to a young mechanic Pete played by Baltzar Getty. He is released from prison and two detectives watch his movements. Surprisingly a woman who resembling Renee appears with the gangster Mr Eddy, by the name of Alice. She is a adult movie performer. Both Pete and Alice romantically acquaint secretly. However she holds a secret and has intentions of her own. END OF SPOILERS<br/><br/>This is one of those movies that really requires attention to the highest level. Uninterrupted concentration too can help fully enjoy the feature. To truly appreciate the movie for what is it is I would recommend that the direction and cinematography is payed attention to. The sub conscious mind also has to be engaged while viewing. Lynch and Gifford have written a script that is flaw less. They have incorporated their imagine to the full potential to create a mystery noir. This is one of Lynch's less disturbing movies but is full of psychological moments. There is confusion at every turn. Everybody will have their own individual theories and takes on the mystery elements. But I can't recall ever having heard of any being an official.<br/><br/>The background score by Angelo Baddlamenti is top rate and suits the tone of the movie perfectly. Many camera shots are sound effects help to assist the movie in terms of special effects. Bill Pullman has the best performance in the movie. The role required a lot of emotional acting and less dialogues and his paranoid expressions are speechless. Patricia Arquette is ravishing in her two different get ups. For a 2 hour 10 minutes movie it may seem long, but it is worth it for a true noir movie fan. I personally love Lynch's work and this film is no exception. Lynch is a genius at creating disturbing, surreal films that continue<br/><br/>to both scare and excite me regardless of how old I get.  His films delve deep into psychological realms within in me and that is why I find his films to be more frightening than most "horror" films.<br/><br/>
The film Lost Highway is enigmatic from the very beginning & it is also quite confusing at times but that is exactly why I enjoy it.  Lost Highway does not have the same qualities that big "Hollywood" movies possess and will not spoon feed you a predictable plot so if you don't enjoy thinking outside of the box than you will not enjoy this movie.  But for those of you that thrive on the strange and unusual, this movie should be a treat, just remember to keep your eyes and your mind open to knew things. Also, keep in mind that some films take several viewings before you get to wrap your mind around them & understand them fully but even if you don't fully understand everything that a film has to offer that does not make the film bad or worthless.  Some things just can not be totally understood, and perhaps that is the point and the pleasure of it all. Lynch is a master of film and his brilliance has shocked and enthralled many, kudos to Lynch for bringing our nightmares and fears out of the dark and onto the screen. Long live Lynch!!!  Long live Lynch!!! The word bizarre is almost an automatic one whenever trying to describe David Lynch. Even at his most accessible, Lynch can't help but strike us as unusual. "Lost Highway" is certainly no exception. In fact, it may be even more bizarre than typical Lynch fare.<br/><br/>The script is an extraordinarily clever example of the possibilities of eschewing all bounds of physical reality for the realm of psychological reality. Psychotic mental disorders present endless possibilities to a filmmaker, since they are defined by their breaks from reality and thus allow the sense of the real world to be ignored. Viewed in this light, "Lost Highway" goes from nonsense to brilliance.<br/><br/>Lynch's direction is beautiful, and he fills the film with endless labyrinth-like shots, reminding us that reality is infinitely dark and unknowable. It is almost impossible not to feel the chills run up and down one's spine when Fred Madison seemingly disappears into the darkness in he and his wife's house and somehow seems to have been lost in it for hours when we next see him, and the metaphysical ramifications of this scene alone--questioning our senses of time and space and our ability to know anything about our reality--are perhaps the defining characteristics of David Lynch and especially of "Lost Highway." The acting is, for the most part, weak. Fortunately, Lynch provides the actors with simple and plain enough characters that their weakness does not get in the way as much as it could; but it is definitely noticeable that Patricia Arquette in particular cannot do a thing (and I cannot imagine men drooling over her the way they are in this film--I really have a hard time imagining any man drooling over her). There are two noticeable exceptions to the generally weak (though not generally as terrible as Arquette) acting: Robert Blake and Robert Loggia. Though much of Blake's work is done for him by the makeup and the script causing his character's undeniable creepiness, Blake plays the character with a sort of cool happiness that is even scarier than this character could be if he truly seemed malicious and then, when he picks up his camera near the end, it's as though a mask comes off and we see someone who is more pure evil than any film character this side of Al Pacino's Richard III. Loggia meanwhile has a fairly easy character but plays him with a wonderful charisma and hits everything on the money. Bill Pullman and Balthazar Getty spend much of the film just looking as confused as the audience but don't seem capable of doing what little else their characters ask of them, though we can hardly see what may have been Pullman's moment to shine--after killing his wife when he looks directly into the camera. Unfortunately, the blurriness of that shot makes it impossible for us to see the evil and anger he should be displaying at that moment.<br/><br/>If you've watched the film and you're looking for an explanation of the plot, here it is: Fred Madison kills his wife and her former boss (when she was in porn) then has a psychotic break, imagining himself as another person and living out the ultimate masculine fantasy in his mind. But reality (The Mystery Man, in my opinion) is always chasing him and once reality catches him, Madison is unable to maintain the illusion and finds himself still attempting to escape the police on a highway (though not the title highway, as I think the title highway is a metaphorical one--the human mind being its actual name). You can see some things rather differently as to what's real and what's not and when things happen, but the basic plot is hard to see differently, even if it might take hours of agonizing later to understand it, still. (Though I will admit that I got it the first time and just have discovered that others say it takes much more work to discover it.)<br/><br/>All in all, "Lost Highway" is a brilliant psychological thriller that delves deeper into the psychotic mind than any other film I have ever seen and wraps us up in an odd mystery of wondering what is happening until there are about fifteen minutes left and suddenly the film shifts into overdrive (play on title not intended) and tells us what's been happening all this time. It may not be the easiest watch, since it doesn't really exist in the linear real world we're used to and it has a ton of sex and some very violent moments; but it's powerful and frightening, as well as deep and gorgeous. Its scares aren't cheap, and so they last far better than those of typical horror/thriller fare. Like Peter Jackson's even more brilliant "Heavenly Creatures," "Lost Highway" preys on one's mind after viewing and becomes more frightening with thought. This is the way thrillers should be and never will be made. My Rating : 9/10<br/><br/>If you are curious about what a nightmare is, watch this movie!<br/><br/>Inspired by classic film-noir and O.J Simpson's case, David Lynch's 'Lost Highway' is his ultimate style statement as a director. All of his trademarks are scattered throughout and it is a pleasure to see it all fuse together like a Moebius strip within the logic of a dream state of consciousness - unconscious/conscious/superconscious.<br/><br/>This movie reminds me of 'Fight Club' greatly due to the main character's identity dissociation - We also have here clever use of surrealism and an arthouse-horror sensibility intertwined within Freudian fundamentals of Id, Ego and Super-ego and a portrayal of different defence mechanisms such as : Denial, displacement, intellectualisation, fantasy, compensation, projection, rationalisation, reaction-formation, regression, repression and sublimation.<br/><br/>Fred's character sums it up nicely when he says : 'I like to remember things my own way. How I remembered them. Not necessarily the way they happened.'<br/><br/>All in all, Lynch's approach works and the emotional and psychical states of the main protagonist are clearly and skilfully shown and interpreted but never fully explained in order so that it can retain viewer engagement and curiosity.<br/><br/>An absolute must-see if you're into psychological movies. For some reason I've always been inexplicably drawn to David Lynch's movies, regardless of how absurd or convoluted they sound. There's a certain dream-like quality to his movies, where things happen and people react in ways that are only slightly removed from reality, not so much that it becomes fantasy and not so little that it's just something that's been scripted, but just enough to unnerve you and make you feel uneasy. In Lost Highway, that's exactly how you feel, you feel like you're in a bad dream; albeit someone else's bad dream. Bill Pullman is the Jazz musician imprisoned for killing his wife only to wake up in his cell as someone else, and then things start to get surreal! For a large part of the movie Bill Pullman becomes Balthazar Getty - a kid with good intentions but seduced by a femme fatale into the shady underworld of pornography and murder led by her mobster boss. The usual cast of mysterious and often scary characters are all in check. Of Lynch's movies, I think this is my favourite so far; the story makes sense to me (in a weird Lynchian way) and the elements of the narrative comes together quite cohesively to give a satisfying conclusion. To me (experts may disagree) this is Lynch's take on the Noir genre, I can easily see this being a Lynch adaptation of a James Ellroy or Raymond Chandler mystery. I highly enjoyed Lost Highway, it's not for everyone though. A saxophonist (Bill Pullman) and his wife (Patricia Arquette) start to receive anonymous video tapes of their house, and each time as each different tapes appear the content starts to change little by little. Their story gets more messed up when they meet a strange and sinister character (Robert Blake) that seems to know more about them than themselves and can be in two different places at the same time. What is revealed after that is the wife's murder by the husband who'll later be arrested, and while waiting for his death sentence simply disappears out of his cell and in his place there's a younger guy (Balthazar Getty). And from that it's a whole different story with different characters but somehow is connected with the earlier plot. Those who love David Lynch mysterious puzzles will love this classic. <br/><br/>Critics underestimate this film and some audiences to do the opposite with it. It's not a bad film neither a great and spectacular film. What's missing here is a higher purpose, something that would made the whole thing more enjoyable than it is. The plot goes through so many twists that are efficiently put to confuse its audience but it gets lost somewhere at times; it just pretends to be a deeper film than it is, but it's not. No message, no ideas, it's given so little to start a discussion on how great the plot is. However, each person can make better readings than I did, so I won't be arrogant enough to say I'm right and you're wrong. <br/><br/>Purely for its aesthetic and the way it is composed, that's what makes of "Lost Highway" a superb film that holds its viewers from the first minute until the credits roll. It is incredible slow in its first half hour but even so you're already there and there's no way you can't walk out of this movie. It's THAT good! The director thinks big in his public while making this film: the soundtrack is absolutely great, one of those that really makes you feel stone cold, fearing what's going to happen next; it's an complex, exciting and thrilling film noir filled with many Lynch references and classic films references as well; it's unmistakable good. It's far more interesting to watch "Lost Highway" to see how the artist builds his art than to root for what's he making, the story and etc. It's far more daring to enjoy how the auteur creates the paranoia of his characters than the paranoia itself which is just a way to mindless people keep saying how crazy this film was. Lynch always knows how to fools and surprises us, never makes us uninterested or bored, he always pushes the envelope and "Lost Highway" is filled with those bizarre moments where you keep saying "Hold on!" trying to connect all the dots and process all the information given to you throughout the experience.<br/><br/>The greatest example of how to make an audience really connected with a film, surprised, shocked and excited at the same time is the classic meeting between the mystery man with Bill Pullman, where everything surrounding them stops, silence for a moment and then it's surprise after surprise. The plot is carefully built in its device of manipulate the viewers but it never explain things in satisfying ways, it's a little bit empty. LIke said earlier the way of the artist to make his thing is what makes of this film something really worth seeing but not just that, the acting is equally great, from the minor characters to the some of the more relevant figures. Best of the show: Robert Loggia playing an menacing gangster; the fore-mentioned Robert Blake, in a performance that should have gave him some awards and nominations (and as of now, his last acting job); Pullman and Arquette (playing double characters) are quite good, hold the film very well. But the director and/or his casting personal should hire another actor for the hunky guy played by Getty. While he has some sex appeal I found him a wrong choice for the part, someone good looking enough to make me believe that an blonde femme fatale like Arquette would feel so attracted to. <br/><br/>Certainly one of the strangest films of the 1990's and a good one. Take a dare and travel to the darkest paths that this lost highway can lead you to. Enjoy the ride and try not to lose your mind while in it. 9/10 I saw this one first in 1999 and was quite intrigued and puzzled; a second viewing in 2006, and some research, helped to clarify what many see as a narrative that makes no sense. On the contrary...<br/><br/>Everybody's on the highway of life and so is Fred Madison (Bill Pullman), a jazz saxophonist at a local club. Fred's life revolves around his jazz music – he plays tenor sax at a local club – and his wife, the stunning Renee (Patricia Arquette), who he thinks is having an affair. But, Fred's not sure with whom, and he's at a loss about what to do...<br/><br/>His seething jealousy is palpable, however, raging just behind the smooth mask of his handsome face.<br/><br/>The appearance of mysterious video tapes at his doorstep, on successive days, changes everything about their lives: first, just a video of the house front, then a second tape has some clips from inside, and when Fred and Renee see a third video of themselves asleep in bed, it is Renee who demands that they call in the cops. Puzzled, but well meaning, the cops give them some advice, check the house, and as they leave their cards with Fred and Renee, one of the cops says: "It's what we do." <br/><br/>Unhappily for Fred, they do more when, a day or so later, Fred finds another tape with a video of himself, covered with blood, and the dismembered body of Renee thrown about the bedroom Fred's arrested, tried for murder and sentenced to die – a very quick and compressed action that's done in three or four quick frames, and with no need for much dialog.<br/><br/>Thereafter, the real story begins – and the viewer is then sucked into a bizarre and complex narrative that is so confusing many viewers throw up their hands in despair.<br/><br/>David Lynch is on record as saying that his film art has been much influenced by Francis Bacon, a painter whose work must be seen to be...hmmm...appreciated. No words of mine can effectively describe a Bacon painting: blurred images, raw flesh, body parts, blood galore, contorted faces all form the immediate images. Beyond that, it's up to you to interpret what you see. So also Lost Highway, it seems, which I would characterize as a dynamic – in a literal sense – work of art that must be seen, again and again and again.<br/><br/>As I indicated, most would say that the complete film makes no sense at all, and you'll find many quotes from critics – including Roger Ebert – to that effect. Space, here, is too short to fully discuss this narrative; suffice to say that I disagree with the Eberts of the world on this one.<br/><br/>Because, for me, Lost Highway makes complete sense when I accept the following premises: (1) Fred is in fact the murderer of his wife; (2) he is, at the very least, temporarily insane, with all the attendant implications of that condition; and (3) he is attempting to rationalize within his mind the unbearable knowledge of what he did. Hence, from go to whoa for the whole movie, we're inside Fred's fantasy as he attempts to absolve his guilt.<br/><br/>The irony, for Fred – and the viewer – is that we're never absolutely sure if Renee was in fact an unfaithful wife.<br/><br/>The plot, the sequence of events, appears to be non-linear – hence my initial confusion and that of others – and yet it is not. It's perfectly circular from start to finish – from the very first frame to the very last – with the full story unfolding with each bizarre event. However, being so complex and so effectively done, it would be foolhardy for me to attempt a summary. See the movie and you'll know why.<br/><br/>The actors in this tour-de-force are well suited to their roles. As Fred, Bill Pullman has that nice guy look that's perfect for hiding homicidal tendencies; this is still his best effort in serious acting, in my opinion. Patricia Arquette – the wife Renee, suspected of infidelity – appears as the quintessential femme fatale – sexy, voluptuous, devious, untrustworthy; her deadpan throughout is the obvious symbol of her dead love for Fred – or anybody, perhaps. Robert Blake – as The Mystery Man – looks suitably spooky as the visible manifestation of Evil. Robert Loggia does the role of gangster so well, I sometimes wonder about him(just kidding). And, Balthazar Getty – an actor I'd not seen before – acquits himself well as the confused young lover (and as Bill Pullman's alter ego) playing with fire.<br/><br/>Finally, if you've not seen any Lynch movies, well... you're in for a psychological treat unlike anything you've seen before, maybe; but, if you're squeamish, be warned. There are gruesomely bloody scenes, explicit sex scenes, and – for fans of terror – creepy dark corridors, a staple of Lynch's later works. In a very real way, I think, Lost Highway is the first of a trilogy of films that has a theme which centers upon the catastrophic effects of jealous rage, and which is expounded upon further with Mullholland Drive (2001) and ending with Inland Empire (2007). It took four of us about two hours of discussion, five hours of thought and eight hours of sleeping on it to work out what the hall happened - but we did it in the end.  I can't tell you what we came up with.  But I can vouch that there IS a plot and it IS possible - and great fun - working out what it is.<br/><br/>By the way: the `it's all just the subjective experience of the central character' theory is false, although it's exactly the kind of dumb thing a modern audience would come up with.  Almost everything we see happen, actually happens.  It's NOT just a dream.  What a lame movie it would be if it were.<br/><br/>David Lynch fans tell me that sure, this film is okay, but I wouldn't like it so much if I'd seen some of Lynch's REALLY good stuff (`Eraserhead' and `Blue Velvet' are the ones appealed to).  This may be true, and it may be why `Lost Highway' isn't so well regarded as it might be, but it's hardly a fair criticism.  `Lost Highway' would be good if it were the only David Lynch film in existence; therefore, it's good.<br/><br/>And I wonder if the Lynch-philes are right.  Of the three other Lynch productions I've seen `Twin Peaks' is a kind of tedious torture, `Dune' is risible, and `The Elephant Man' is virtually a TV special.  `Lost Highway' is terrifying and has a story well worth the effort of deciphering.  In case you're wondering, there's no gratuitous gore, either.  Scenes that force us to shut our eyes are all very well, but while we're looking away from the screen, we can't be frightened by it. (There are Spoilers) Not really a story but a mind altering nightmare for jazz saxophone player Fred Madison, Bill Pullman. Fred goes through a life-changing experience that has him go through the film at first as a victim of a brutal crime where his wife Renee, Patricia Arquette, is murdered. Then later Fred become a participant of another murder of porno film maker Andy, Michael Massee. It's after that where he's evolved into an entirely different person altogether! Then later back to being himself Fred Madison as he again becomes involved in yet another brutal killing in the slashing/shooting of a murderous mob boss Eddy aka Dick Laurent! All this is with the help of this creeped-out looking Mystery Man, Robert Blake, who pops up in the movie in a number of scenes, unannounced and unexpected. The Mystery Man looking like he was made up to be an over-aged and over plastered Japanese Geisha Girl.<br/><br/>The nightmare begins for Fred when he receives in the mail, with no forwarding or return address, a video tape of his house an later another tape of not only his house but himself and his wife Renee sleeping in bed. Going to the police Fred is told that they can really do nothing since no crime, other then voyeurism, was committed. Earlier we see Fred invited to this strange party where he's introduced to a friend of Renee named Andy who in turn introduces him to the Mystery Man. The Mystery Man tells Fred that he not only knows where he lives but that at this very moment he's in Fred and Renee's house! Calling home on the Mystery Man's cell phone Fred is answered by the Mystery Man himself who seems to be at two places at the same time!<br/><br/>As both we and Fred are trying to figure what exactly is happening in this weird movie that were watching he's suddenly arrested for the murder of his wife Renee and put on death row, without the benefit of a trial and conviction, waiting execution. Freaking out to whats happening to him Fred then seems to morph into a much younger man named Peter Dayton, Balthazar Getty, in his jail cell. The warden then has no choice but to let him go free. We then learn that Peter was arrested some time ago for car theft, and given a years probation, and lives with his parents William and Candace Dayton, Gary Busey & Lucy Butler. Peter also has this hot to trot girlfriend Sheila, Natasha Gregson Wagner, who's always taking off her clothes when she's with him as both her and Peter are almost always eagerly making out with each other. If it wasn't for Fred coming back on the scene later in the movie I had the feeling that actor Bill Pullman walked off the set being disgusted in what he was offered to play in the film and was replaced by actor Balthazar Getty without the writer/director David Lynch not bothering to re-shoot the scenes with Pullman in them!<br/><br/>It turns out that Peter is a crack a jack car mechanic working at Arnie's, played by a wheelchair bound Richard Pryor, garage who's very well regarded by gangster Eddy aka Dick Laurent, Robert Loggia, for his mechanical abilities in fixing his car. Eddy is a hair triggered hot tempered hood who you don't mess around with. We see him in action later when he works over this tailgater on the highway, who also gave Eddy the finger, by first ramming his car and then beating and pistol whipping the guy almost within a inch of his life.<br/><br/>Eddy is also seen at the garage with this blond bombshell of a woman Alice Wakefield who's his personal squeeze and gun moll, also played by Miss Arquette. Alice get's Peter so turned on and excited and ready to go into action that he can't seem to keep his mind on his work for even a moment. Peter is instead played by Alice like first-class sucker in having him not only risk his life and freedom but also lose his overly friendly and sexually active girlfriend Sheila.<br/><br/>Playing around with his moll behind his back can have the loose wired Eddy put an end to Peters life with a gun stuck up so hard and far up his behind and then having his brains, like Eddy told him, blown out of his head. The manipulating Alice also wants Peter to murder her former porn movie producer Andy and then take off with her to this creepy hotel in Death Valley and from there take off to Mexico. Thats after a night of fun and games in the sack, or in the desert, with her that turns the cool night temperature of the area up some 50 degrees.<br/><br/>Getting all that she wanted from him including murdering Andy Alice then leaves Peter with his pants, in fact all his clothes, off and takes off leaving him to his fate; being murdered by her outraged lover Eddy. It's just then Peter turns into Fred and the Mystery Man, camcorder in hand, shows up together with a couple of cops looking into Renee's, remember her, murder and what at first seemed like a dream or better yet nightmare becomes a reality.<br/><br/>Very strange movie that doesn't make any sense at all until the ending that gives you the impression that it was all some kind of hallucination on Fred's part. In that the entire story was the result of him being on drugs or somehow hypnotized until he finally snapped out, or the drugs wore off. It was then that he finally realized what he did! As the mysterious saying at the start of the film "Dick Laurent Is Dead" takes on a whole new meaning when it's repeated, by Fred, just as "Lost Highway" finally, after 135 minutes, comes to an end. ***Spoilers do follow for Lost Highway and  Mullholand Drive.  You have been warned.***<br/><br/>I watched it two nights in the row. After the first viewing I knew I'd missed a lot - but also knew I wanted to see it again. "Whatever I understood was beautiful, whatever I did not understand was probably even more beautiful" and I wanted to find it. What helped me to figure it out (or at least I think I did) were two films I kept thinking about when watching LH both times: Bunuel's 'That Obscure Object of Desire' and Lynch's Mulholland Drive. In Bunuel's film the main character's object of desire is played by two very different actresses. In LH the man who desires is played by two actors (Bill Pullman as Fred, the musician - in the amazing performance and Balthazar Getty as Pete, the mechanic). The object of their desire is Patricia Arquette, gorgeous Renee the Brunette, Fred's wife and seductive Alice the Blonde, the fire of Pete's loins. Is this the same woman? Are they twins? Is she a dream? That's for us, viewers to figure out. And we are on our own - Lynch knows but he would not help. I also think that in LH Lynch tells the same story (if he ever tells the stories) or paints the same painting like in MD: the story of gut-wrenching love, desire, obsession and jealousy. You can destroy the object of your desire but you will never be able to kill the love and longing for it. It will come back to you in your dreams; it will haunt you as long as you are able to feel. It will live in your soul and your head and torture you as long as you are alive. And you will never be able to have it.<br/><br/>I think Lost Highway is Lynch's masterpiece, absolutely perfect film on all levels. It goes on the top of my list a little ahead of MD because the original idea belongs here. Quoting myself:<br/><br/>      "One thing I don't understand: why MD which is secondary to LH  is so universally praised and well known while LH is considered lesser movie or even the failure. For me, LH is a masterpiece, a perfect film where everything works: visuals, sound (one of the most amazing soundtracks ever. I never thought I'd say this: I liked Marylyn Manson's version of I Put a Spell on You), acting - Patricia Arquette -there is some child like innocence in her that makes all men in the film completely mad about her."<br/><br/>
How  does Lynch do it? What is his magic touch? How does he make his actors do what they do? Who dictates to him how to arrange perfectly every single frame so nothing is missing and everything is on its place? In the film so claustrophobic, there is a breathtaking aerial shot of the highway with two cars racing - it is beauty itself. <br/><br/>That's what he had to say about his enigmatic underrated gem:<br/><br/>      "There's a human condition there - people in trouble, people led into situations that become increasingly dangerous. And it's also about mood and those kind of things that can only happen at night. You can just take that and run with it your own way."<br/><br/>      "There is a key in the film as to its meaning. But keys are weird. There are surface keys, and there are deeper keys. Intellectual thinking leaves you high and dry sometimes. Intuitive thinking where you get a marriage of feelings and intellect lets you feel the answers where you may not be able to articulate them. Those kinds of things are used in life a lot, but we don't use them too much in cinema. There are films that stay more on the surface, and there's no problem interpreting their meaning." <br/><br/>
      "Death Valley is so beautiful. It just goes on forever. I like the idea of shooting in Death Valley - just the name. It made perfect sense for Lost Highway."<br/><br/>On the lighter note - You actually can learn something very important and useful from Lost Highway - please be polite to the other drivers on the road - you never know who the guy you just fingered turned out to be. :) This is the climax of pseudo-intellectual, sexist, complacent cinema which is so frequent among directors who either can't accept their age or have no talent. In this case, though, it's both and that's what makes it so terrible. <br/><br/>Of course, one might praise the visual aspects but it's no use doing so if the contents are that ridiculous. The (rare) dialog is embarrassing and there are a few shots of Patricia Arquette even adult film directors would refrain from. The plot is not mysterious or difficult, there simply is none. All of a sudden the leading character is someone else. That is the clumsiest plot twist conceivable. Besides, it's boring and obvious that even the actors don't know what they're doing. I can't believe a woman edited and co-produced this stuff because it is a degradation and offense to all women.If you watch a Jerry Bruckheimer film you'll at least get a story even if it's unpleasant-this is far worse. Okay, that one subplot about the couple receiving video tapes of their home was scary and had great potential. Totally wasted, of course.<br/><br/>The movie quickly becomes a disjointed mess and was so utterly and completely EVIL that I threw up on the sidewalk outside the theater. That's right, this movie is not merely bad, stupid, appalling, and wretched, it is EVIL, that's right, evil to the core. NO WONDER people thought poor Robert Blake murdered his wife, how such a fine and extremely talented actor could appear in this sewage defies the imagination.<br/><br/>Movies are supposed to entertain, perhaps educate, enlighten, even scare you...but they should not make you honk up your popcorn and hot dogs. I felt like I needed an exorcism just for having seen this film, but had to make do with a 45 minute steaming hot shower. This is the most shockingly religious film I've ever seen. I think i finally get the point of David Lynch after seeing this movie again (first time around i though it was a bit pointless and artsy like everyone else). The one little thing that finally made the film register for me was the Islamic tattoo on Bill Pullmans hand that you have to strain to see in the party scene, thereafter everything fell into place : The born again thing when he turns into Balthazar Getty, the introspection at the beginning when he finally discovers himself by watching the video tapes, the demon/demonic angel he meets at the party and dispatches Robert Loggai to hell after showing him his sins (on a portable TV), Gettys vision of hell in the mansion (now i know why Marilyn Manson appears in that sequence) and at long last i get the ending. It's not just a hackneyed cliche of the chase movie, he's on the run from the demons that chase us all, and again he starts to change personality right at the end of the movie. That seems to be the whole movie summed up : the human fight between attaining god and avoiding sin and evil. It's just a shame there seems to be a little bit of male heterosexual idiocy in painting women as the symbol of sin and temptation. Some things never change. Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>I love this film. I knew I would be in for an unforgettable ride that would not give up for a second. I got what I expected because my expectations were just right. Let me explain. I didn't know about David Lynch until I saw Mulholland Drive. Sure, I remember seeing the commercial for Lost Highway when it first came out, but I knew nothing about the film or who made it then. I loved everything about Mulholland Drive except for the incoherent story. Well, that is a big part of the movie, isn't it? It took me some time to get over that, and actually think about it (although I'm not close to being done). Anyways, having watched Mulholland Drive, and learning some information about Lynch afterwards gave me the right expectations for this film.<br/><br/>Lost Highway is not for everybody. I think film noir, surrealism, and dark movies are generally not for the mainstream casual movie audience. I think it is an acquired taste, and only certain people will like this movie. Of course, if you're an open-minded person, and can handle strong content, then you might appreciate this film. Most detractors don't like this film for the same reason they don't like other Lynch films like Mulholland Drive, mainly because the story doesn't reveal itself right away. Their main argument is that films like these put nonsensical elements together and pretend to be art, and that people just eat it up. I am glad that there are critical people like this around who question the artistic value of such films because it's good to be skeptical rather than accepting things right away. I'm not art expert, and I believe it's hard to be one because so many subjective elements make up art. Sure there are objective elements one can look at, but it still comes down to your personal views about it (somewhat like film reviews). Anyways, these disputes will never settle, and so there is no point in arguing one way or the other, it's more about how the film connects with you.<br/><br/>For me, entering the Lost Highway, I knew I would see bizarre things with wild twists and turns. I knew the movie would not be wrapped up with everything explained at the end. So one reason I watched this is mainly for the experience. So what can I say about the experience? Most of the movie was dark (literally and figuratively). Only few scenes contained daylight. The atmosphere was intense and never let up the entire movie. The background was droning with ominous sounds. <br/><br/>I think Bill Pullman who plays Fred did an excellent job of creating the mood. At the beginning, we see him smoking, his face distraught and lost. He gets a buzz at the intercom and the message says, "Dick Laurent is dead." At the end of the film, Fred leaves that message at his home before going on the wild police chase. Supposedly, Fred killed his wife, Dick Laurent, and Andy. One key line in the film is Fred saying, "I like to remember things my own way...Not necessarily the way they happened." One theory is that while he was being executed for the murders, Fred thinks back to what happened, mixing the real with the imagined (the Pete character).<br/><br/>
One question that some wonder about is who taped Fred's house along with the murder of his wife, if indeed the Mystery Man is a part of Fred's conscience. To answer this question, one might refer to the Mystery Man saying, "You invited me. It is not my custom to go where where I am not invited." This doesn't necessarily answer the question if he's real or not, or if he really videotaped everything. One thing to remember is that the character is pervasive throughout the film. He's on the intercom at the beginning, at the party with Andy (and at the same time in Fred's house), with Dick Laurent when he calls Pete, at the cabin, and at Dick Laurent's shooting.<br/><br/>The imagery in this movie is unforgettable, from the love scene between Pete and Alice to the look on Fred's face as he rides away at the end. I still can remember the scene at the beginning when Fred is making love to Renee and the time shifts to slow motion. With exasperated pants and breathes from Fred we realize that he is disturbed and disgusted as something is eating away at his mind. The look on the Mystery Man's face is haunting with his big black dark eyes, his pallid aged face, and the look of a sinister being.<br/><br/>
The soundtrack to Lost Highway is great with songs by Marilyn Manson, Rammstein, Smashing Pumpkins, Nine Inch Nails and others. Lynch packed the movie with great eery sounds throughout so that it's made to feel like a nightmare. Yes, some may feel the movie is a nightmare because it gets under your skin. It makes you uncomfortable. I think that's what makes it so great, to have the power to cause real reactions.<br/><br/>Lost Highway is one suspenseful horror that takes the viewer to the depths of the mind and reveals fears of the unknown. I loved this film, but I'm sure most mainstream viewers won't. This movie will appeal to the film noir audience and people with a love for the Absurd. After this, the U.S. Horror Movie Genre died, and what a shame. This film is simply a masterpiece, a true nightmare caught on film and concocted by the genius of David Lynch. This is his best work, Mulholland Drive is great, but can't compare to this underrated classic. Everyone involved in the film hit their marks and the actors involved gave some of their best performances of their careers, especially Bill Pullman, Balthazar Getty, and a creepy Robert Blake.  Must be seen more than once, I won't explain anything except that Bill Pullman's character transforms into another person, and other, otherworldly events occur.  Strongly recommended for film buffs. I saw this in the theater because it looked slightly interesting, but had quite low expectations. I was blown-away. I came out of the movie theater in a daze wondering what happened. A movie has never had so much impact on me before.<br/><br/>It's a masterpiece. It leaves you confused, yet it makes sense in it's own way. Only after repeated viewings did I figure out why I liked this movie so much. It's basically about how jealousy and suspicion can drive someone insane. Ideas I could relate to, more or less, in my lifetime. So while I may not have understood it at first, deep down it was always a pleasing experience. This movie MADE me become a David Lynch fan.<br/><br/>The VHS version does this movie NO justice. Seeing this in a movie theater is a must. This movie is incredible!  Very original approach at filmmaking and an awesome dreamlike/nightmarish original plot.  This movie is very surrealistic, but doesn't go over the top to become an artsy-type film.  I could go on and on about it, but I'll just say- you have to see this movie!!!  Lynch at his finest. In this day and age, there are few film makers who are no longer just in it for the money, few who don't stick with the same old formulas. David Lynch is one of them. Being a Lynch fan, I was a little cautious watching this, thinking he might have sold out, but this is PURE Lynch! Great film that makes you feel different after viewing it. Highly original, and Fantastically directed, this is one of his best. 10/10 I've seen the film some fourteen times and every time I try to make sense out of it, it's just a jumbled mess. If you don't try to make sense of it, it makes perfect sense. Bill Pullman and Balthazar Getty are just guys, the mystery man is who it is about.<br/><br/>From that first creepily echoed laugh over the phone at the party it's confusing as hell. And then Bill Pullman murders his wife and Balthazar, that wacky kid, runs off with both girls who are only one girl.<br/><br/>Situational sensibility:<br/><br/>The beginning is strange and doesn't start to make sense until Pete turns into Fred at the end.<br/><br/>Going back over it, it's a confusing ten mile a minute(600 mph)run. The mystery man is Fred and Pete. Mystery man is an old guy who never chronicled his youth photographically. He's old now and using some sort of psychic sensibility takes over the minds of already mad, not explained but implied madness, men and forces them to perform acts he's accomplished in his youth. Taking their lives, ruining their lives, he uses them(notice how they all look strikingly similar)to make a photo imaged report of the activities in his youth.<br/><br/>That's as much sense as I've pulled from this film, as of yet. It's amazing and if you decide to watch 'Go' instead, Robert Blake'll get you too.<br/><br/>Marilyn Manson stars as a porn star. This movie defies various axioms, paradigm's, and conventions of the movie world in particular and of the art of storytelling in general. Lost Highway is a must see for every true appreciator of cinema. This movie forces the spectator to have an opinion, and whatever yours may be after viewing... the genius, meant in the most strict sense of the word (!) must be admitted. Even discarded of it's "intellectual" values, stripped down to a sequence of moving pictures it remains a masterpiece! As more of David Lynch's work it is a mind blowing visual experience. And just to say after reading some comments on the board: the music is very supportive of the scenes and amplifies the visual experience as a whole. This said I do understand the sense of "lostness" after viewing the movie, but rather then jumping to conclusions let it sink in, just for one minute if you will. Think about this feeling of despair you are left with, trying to tackle the bigger plot or story, and then, maybe, just maybe you'll see the greatness of Lost Highway. If this still doesn't convince you, get a copy anyway. Put it away, and whenever you meet someone you like, but you can't help but wonder if (s)he is the right one for you...let him / her watch Lost Highway and watch their reaction. Trust me, there is no greater divider of souls in this world.<br/><br/>greetz. In interviews Lynch has said that he tried to imagine what it was like in the mind of a murderer. He wondered how someone can keep on living after having committed this crime. He made a movie about it which ended up being Lost highway.<br/><br/>Sound like fun? Not really. The film is a trip through Hell and it's disturbing, frightening, eerie, unsettling, bleak and depressing as you might expect.<br/><br/>What's the point of making a movie like this? It's an examination of the psyche. A presentation of Lynch's speculation and imagination. A serious affair. But to what end? In my opinion we're better off going to the cinema to get inspired, thrilled and entertained.<br/><br/>That's not to say that Lost highway is bad. Far from it. It's a well made film technically and artistically. It's just that it's a depressing affair which if you ask me is rather pointless in the end.<br/><br/>When shown to psychologists it could spark a discussion that's interesting to them though. But at the same time, it's not like Lynch has shown anything new. He has also stated that someone came to him during or after the production and said what the correct medical term was for the psychological state of the main character of the film. So once again, what's the point? If you don't know, 'Lost Highway' is the 1997 film by (Twin Peaks-famed) David Lynch - a writer/director known for his slightly obscure types of films. Calling Lost Highway 'slightly obscure' is one of the biggest understatements of all time.<br/><br/>It's a puzzle and a mystery and maybe even a visual experience rather than a traditional narrative story. You could even liken (some of) it to an 'art house' movie, if it wasn't for the fact that there definitely is a recognisable story in there... somewhere.<br/><br/>It's about a man who changes into another man when he's locked up in his prison cell. Why? Good question. Just don't expect any answers (or at least any concrete ones).<br/><br/>Lost Highway is visually stunning with magnificent direction and a haunting soundtrack. But is it understandable? No, not really. Yes, if you go to the lengths of looking up its 'true meaning' on various internet message boards, you will see what's supposed to be happening. But, before you watch it, ask yourself whether you're willing to invest over two hours of your life in a film where you have to research it afterwards to truly understand it. So, although it CAN be understood, I seriously doubt there are many people who can (honestly) say that they 'got it' the first time around.<br/><br/>I love it. I love all of David Lynch's work. However, I confess that I did have to look towards the internet to finally determine what it was all about.<br/><br/>It is certainly enjoyable, even though it's brutal, sadistic and violent. However, it - like all Lynch's work - is not for everyone. You have to be in the mood for something (more than) a little different. It's not just horror, it's mind-bending horror that may or may not even be horror in the first place. You think you're confused now... wait until you've travelled down the 'lost highway' with Fred, Renee, Pete and Alice.<br/><br/>Special mention to Robert Blake for his portrayal of 'the mystery man' - one of cinema's truly terrifyingly creepy characters. As I find with most of Lynch's films, Lost Highway works best if one can decipher the basic story framework through which the illusory doublings and wish fulfillments, and desires and agonies filter. A sort of male antecedent to the distaff Mulholland Dr., the story is likewise driven by sexual obsession, denial, and intense guilt that leads the protagonist, Fred Madison (Bill Pullman), to create a dream scenario into which he can escape his inner torment. He's perhaps even more delusional than Diane Selwyn, however, and at one point he voices a maxim ("I like to remember things my own way; not necessarily how they happened") that both illustrates his fear of confronting reality and neatly explains the vertiginous twists and refractions contained in the film, which is Madison's chronicle of reckoning with horrific choices. Lynch prepares the viewer for the big twist (Balthazar Getty taking Pullman's place in the story) by suggesting Madison's turbulent inner life with frames that jar in and out of focus—approximating subconscious interference and, in Getty's portion, the intrusion of reality—extreme close-ups, figures materializing in darkness, and his own disruptive sound design, full of synthesized industrial noise and heightened everyday sounds. Appropriately, Madison recasts his victimization tale as a film noir, with himself-as-Getty as a mechanic who falls in love with a gangster's pretty blonde moll, played by Patricia Arquette, who also plays his slain brunette wife. Madison deifies her as an insatiable love goddess, irresistible and ever-receptive to his needs, but tarnished by her dissolute associations with other men, a jealousy that mirrors his adulterous suspicions involving his wife, a smut peddler, and a man named Dick Laurent, envisioned as an old gangster named Mr. Eddy (Robert Loggia).<br/><br/>Further doublings, reflections, and parallels between the two stories abound—there's an unidentified incident that Getty can't remember, and the vision of an inversely exploding cabin bookends the central transformation. There is a thrill in trying to unlock the puzzle, but the film is most significant for seamlessly evoking the layout of an involved dream-delusion—Getty's repeated exclamation, "I want you," to the idealized image of Arquette (who replies, "You'll never have me"), concurrently summing up the state of waking from a great dream and Madison's sexual despair, may even top Mulholland Dr. for mapping out tactile subconscious yearning—and detailing the bleak recesses of a tortured soul. More than just an oracle of figurative states, Lynch also displays a finely tuned sense of droll humor. Like the bumbling hit-man in Selwyn's projection, Mr. Eddy's menace is absurdly realized in his battery of an obnoxious tailgater. Aurally, Angelo Badalamenti shares the soundscape with various rock contributors, notably Lou Reed and David Bowie, whose brooding "I'm Deranged" sets the tone from the opening credits. So easy to get lost in such an immersive ambiance, which truly provides an embarrassment of sensory riches; one can simply coast along for the ride and still find a transportable experience. Lynch is that rare director who can illuminate unknown territory through his complementary cinematic and storytelling abilities. OK, been awhile since i seen this film but memories of the film still remain with me. I like odd films so keep that in mind in respect of my high mark. I sometimes find reality abit questionable myself so this film was right up my street. I found the film mostly easy enough to understand compared to some of David lynch's other works so that was a big plus. I enjoyed mulholland drive for obvious reasons but hadnt much of a clue what it was about. The film moves along at a nice pace. The devil character is worth watching the film for alone. Acting is superb all round. Film leaves a lasting effect on the audience. In a good way. Really enjoyed it and hope anyone who watches it does too. Well, thats my little piece. Give it a shot, not everyone will like it but hope a few of you do.... any new movie for David Lynch means a new discovery,a new vision of film-making,a new nightmare as i have mentioned before.he is my favorite director of all decades.above Hitchcock,Ford,Hawks &... he follows his method of film making without any mistakes and does not care about others.he gives the final conclusion to the viewer and wants him to think and analyze what he wants.i refer you to his very early movies like Eraserhead or Elephant man.he goes as strange as it gets.and sees no further description to destroy viewer's mind .how many movie directors do you know in the world that does the same job??? to tremble you and passion you all over the picture?to force you to think and analyze?thats just few ones that do it.one of the most expert ones is Lynch.he makes his movies straight from heart.that doesn't make his heart wild.he has very special opinions of the industry and makes himself responsible. about Lost Highway i cant judge very simple,it is most strange,most Disturbing.so it is not that simple to review on this picture.it faces Fred Madison's(Bill Pullman) nightmarous life.a jazz man who always suspects his wife Renee(Patricia Arquette).Fred lives within a dark condition of life.he supposes his wife that has a close affair with Dick Laurent(Robert Loggia).a porno firm maker and a gangster.and while having sex with Renee he always sees a terrifying face who is Mystery Man(Robert Blake).he receives video tapes from inside his own house that shows Fred that has massacred Renee and for that he goes to prison.by being on the prison Frad changes to Pete(Balthazar Getty).a mechanic who has no clear idea what he does in the prison... is it confusing?if yes,thats not your problem.it is maybe the problem of 90 percent of the viewers.its not just simple to find out about Lost Highway.it is a real highway that you are losing at it.anyway David Lynch makes this dark picture to do this with your mind.force it to be an analyzer.that depends of your mind of how to make it or get along with it.it is most terrifying picture of the Lynch.it is full of bizarre.starts with darkness and ends with darkness.putting you in a very suspending position. the performances are good.everybody is doing their best.but Robert Blake's performance as Mystery Man is shining above all.he is most terrifying person in the picture.for that i do admire him.the rest are good. my suggestion as a new interviewer:don't bother yourselves too much.you wont get it too simple.they are all masterpieces.10 out of 10 Lost Highway puzzles every viewer. You don't know what it's about, but you seem to keep getting clues that there is a way to get to know the meaning of it all. Lynch himself of course doesn't tell, and probably also doesn't know what the movie's about, too. I remember I read somewhere that a journalist asked Lynch if the film may be was about schizophrenia (which could be, I think, a plausible explanation); Lynch answered something like: "... yeah, may be... that could be what it's about! ...". Another suggestion is, that the first story follows the second. In both cases the transformation sequence in the prison would be just a scene to mislead the viewer. It doesn't actually matter what it all means, the experience of Lost Highway is powerful enough, answers are not necessary... This movie is a favorite of mine, and I have a very personal connection with it that is unperturbed by the comments involving its excessiveness or vacuousness. I can imagine such a person, energetic and excited by his own misunderstanding, looking for a channel with which to justify his apparent ineptitude with some explanation of an antithetical sanity. I am not challenged or disturbed by anybody like that.<br/><br/>Lost Highway is an authentic movie. Its director is genuine, and has always made films like this. He has always been somebody troubled by an uncommon lack of distraction, and therefore, when he is not seeing everything in its nakedness without an amiable song in his head or a happy facade he is superimposing on the world, he is seeing it all with a troll shard in his eye, recognizing the immanent ugliness which a nice connotation cannot conceal. Although it is a theoretical idea, one that you may have no use for, it is evident through Lynch's collection and application of sound, along with his visions of everything in the world as unassisted and scarily uninviting. Undoubtedly, David Lynch would never admit to anything like this, because he is too pure to be an intellectual. He is experiential and intuitive, a real and indisputable artist rather than a critic, theorist or didactic informant. <br/><br/>And Lost Highway is, amongst all of his movies, the most audacious, (Eraserhead coming close but being too complete and ambitious to want to inspire much interpretive difficulty or frustration). While I will always love Lost Highway despite claims against its incoherence and frivolity, I must at least waste my time to say that the observations of the detractors are right. Those two qualities are present and actual attractions, and are demonstrative of the artistic fullness and unimpeded representational ability of the director. I go to Lynch's movies because of their incoherence, for the same reason why I go to a writer who lacks sociopolitical interest. He is someone too generous to ideas to cloud them with periodic assertions and interruptions involving social or political information. And coherence is a social product: it has been developed traditionally by filmmakers, and has been proved to work because audiences generally like it. People generally like understanding what is going on. Not to say that they should be ashamed of their often anxious and natural inquisitiveness, but they should at least realize that the most timeless art is not devoted entirely to lucidity and linearity. A thought, reflection or image gestates independent of such obligatory qualifications, which is why the impositions of structure and common interpretations of quality force it through a filter. David Lynch is the real thing, and his films defy the filter. Why can't certain viewers understand this? Why is authenticity so difficult to receive, and why is it that any kind of experiment seems to them a failure to match convention, and why are you so proud of your claims regarding its incomprehensibility, as if its fans had never realized this? Why have you all made me look ridiculous, sitting here writing this tirade in support of an artist you need to come to terms with, to submit to? How well I remember the arguments among the faithful Lynch fanatics when "Wild at Heart" was released.  And yet again when the Twin Peaks film showed up for its two-day run.  It seems that about the only things Lynch fans can agree on is that "Eraserhead" is a classic, "Blue Velvet" is his masterpiece, and the Twin Peaks series is certainly interesting, if not entirely successful.<br/><br/>"Lost Highway" beats them all on the debating front.  However, I beg to differ with the reviewer who claimed it is a love-it-or-hate-it affair.  I neither love nor hate this film.  To me, it is a triumph of mediocrity, with the odd spiky bit here and there to remind one that someone of great filmmaking ability had a hand in it.  Here's the good, the bad, and the ugly:<br/><br/>The good is essentially the first 40 minutes or so of the film.  The atmosphere is almost unspeakably tense, and the low-level rumbling sound present in every scene truly makes one feel trapped in a nightmare of sorts (incidentally, a theater is required for that effect).  The infamous "tailgating" scene is also wonderful, though it is just a fragment that could just as easily belong to another film.  An honorable mention goes to the sex scene in the desert illuminated by headlights while This Mortal Coil's version of Tim Buckley's "Song to the Siren" plays on the soundtrack.<br/><br/>The bad:  Almost any scene which attempts to push the plot forward.  The arguments against this film usually state that the plot doesn't make any sense.  The arguments for the film counter that by saying that it is a work of art and doesn't need to make sense.  While in the latter camp as a matter of principle, I must also state that a film which attempts to be plot-focused and intimates that its story makes sense when it clearly does not is neither artistic nor intelligent, but merely clumsy and calculated.<br/><br/>The ugly:  The sadomasochistic eroticism introduced into the film for no other reason but in awareness that the audience's patience has been stretched to the breaking point, so we'd better give them an eyeful of something.<br/><br/>My recommendation?  Watch the film once, and if you haven't hit the rewind button by the end, watch it once more.  Then pop in "Blue Velvet" to see a talented director completely assured of what he wants to say. This film is simply a beautiful journey through the world of your own imagination. It's as beautiful as you would like it to be or as ugly and evil as you'd like it to be. Is there really a murder on the wife? Is it really Pullman leaving his cell or is it all just in his head, picturing himself as a younger boy, looking at his wife as he always wanted her to be? Is she really cheating on him? Why is the picture changed from two Arquettes to just one when the cops look at it? Is perhaps the last ride in the film a way of showing us that Pullman is being electricuted? Well... Lynch only knows. But please don't be upset about the confusing plot, this is what is there for. It's there so you can decide for yourself... David Lynch takes the cinematic experience one step further. Again! When I saw this film for the first time, I found it fairly complex. But its complexity and Lynch' variated use of powerful means, makes this movie what it is; an overwelming cinematic experience. David Lynch' particularly choice of lightning and camera angles makes it interesting and exciting to watch. The movie's excellent soundtrack and superb acting performances keeps you riveted to the edge of your chair through the film's two hours. The surreal and sombre tone contributes to enhance all of the movie's different aspects. I recommend this movie for everyone with a taste for a wicked, different told story. By one of the greatest inside his range, David Lynch. I study art, and many times in art history, people ahead of their time have been ignored or neglected because of how different what they have accomplished is to everything else. This is a perfect illustration of it. Lynch is ahead of his time, and this film is a gem. The wide range of elements that constitute a film were given a thought, from choosing each actor and actress that constitute the cast to the various musical choices who are also very relevant to the sequences they accompany. One can appreciate the quality with which Lynch frames each one of his scenes, the humor in the dialogues, the intriguing story and concatenation of events, or how punchy and dynamic some sequences are, when it comes down to describing anger, passion or excitement. I hope the missing sequences of this film will be added in a re-release or on a special version of a DVD someday. In the meanwhile, as many people as possible should watch this atemporal film... Make sure you dim the lights! I remember when I read a review for this three-hour test of my patience and sanity. Words like "terrifying" and "provocative" leaped off the page making Lost Highway sound like a modern masterpiece of horror. Unfortunately, David Lynch and the critics that praised this complete waste of time were obviously on heavy doses of LSD.<br/><br/>The first 15 minutes start off OK. In fact, if Lynch had of followed the direction the first few scenes took, Lost Highway could have been an OK film. But alas, the plot quickly takes the downward spiral and just keeps gaining speed until it resembles a bad acid trip. The plot is not even illogical; it is non-existent. I have seen the cast in previous films, but nothing seemed to be able to save this film from becoming a kaleidoscope of nonsensical scenes, irrelevant plot twists, and sub-standard acting. I watched it through to it's anti-climactic 3 hour conclusion expecting at some point for it all to make sense, and ended up feeling that I had wasted three hours of my life I would never get back.<br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy. It has justly earned the title of "The Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen". Please, just bypass this one and avoid torturing yourself. Lost highway is not your typical Hollywood. It is something else. It's not about how the plot ties and winds; it's about how you feel. As soon as the movie starts to "thrill", you have this feeling of uneasiness that won't go away. Even in the most hardcore thrillers there are moments of relief where you can recover for a couple of seconds and take a sip from your coffee. Or the director uses this as a "fake relief" in order to achieve a great shock. But a typical moviegoer knows this trick well and expects a shocker during these fake relief moments.<br/><br/>But in Lost Highway, there are no reliefs. At all. You have that uneasy feeling of "OMG, something is about to happen" all the movie; yet most of the time nothing shocking happens. Sometimes it does though, seemingly randomly. So you expect it to happen, and it happens and is still a big shocker to you. This is Lynch genius.<br/><br/>Don't expect to fully understand the plot. Understanding does not reward you any tiny bit like in "Memento" for example. Just let your feelings go. This is a journey and Lynch is the driver. But everything is not non-sense random, there seems to be a twisted link between everything, you feel the connections but cannot name them.<br/><br/>Lynch is a pure artist. But it's not an "art for art" movie at all. His plots could be cunningly smart. Some weird subtle gesture of an actor may lead you to think "OK, Lynchian absurdity", and turns out to be a big clue for the real plot. Like "I like to remember things my own way." You'd think that this is weird to say to a cop when you first hear it, after watching the whole movie it makes another sense.<br/><br/>You can also never be sure of the chronological order of the events, it may or may not have happened now; one event can fit in so many gaps perfectly that you can have a hundred theories yet each one can make perfect sense all at the same time.<br/><br/>This movie is something else. Watch it with zero expectations, Lynch knows where to lead you. But I should warn you, this movie haunts you long after. It will take a long time before you can let it off your sub-conscience. Not because it is so scary; it is; but because the story is told directly to your sub-conscience, bypassing your daily brain. Go watch it. 9/10 My girlfriend says. i really like lynch, the elephant man is awesome, so i take the movie from the store an I start so see Lost Highway with the idea of a very good night of movies, but Oh My God...<br/><br/>An horribly photo direction, the worst music selection ever (please, rammstein an Marilyn Manson are good, but not in this way). A veeeery slow movie without direction, just a Bob Pullman in a very flat role,and OK, Mrs arquette looks sexy but... if a want to see her naked, i go to internet, Mr Lynch just put a naked woman every boring scene (a lot).<br/><br/>OK, you can see that I'm very disappointed whit this man, Lynch is the most fake art creator ever. Just see Dune to agree with me, OK the elephant man is kind of nostalgic, but, Lost Highway just makes you feel older and stupid, and i want these 2 hours of my life back. By far one or lynch's best movies. When I watched Lost highway for the first time round I was left confused. When it came to watching it for the second time round it all made sense. Lost highway is a film full of mystery/romance /crime perfectly blended together. Lost highway is one of the very few films I recommend to people. In my opinion lynch's second best movie ! Lost Highway is another Lynch film that captures the blurred line between dreams and reality. There's something about the way David Lynch's mind works that allows him to completely control the grey area that stands between normal feelings and insurmountable fear or discomfort. A lot of times he does so with the aid of using dream-like elements for the narrative. In the case of Lost Highway, the dream is really more of a nightmare, as the themes explored in this "story" can be pretty dark or just overall pretty scary. Yes, Lost Highway is definitely a horror, and an effective one at that, at least to me.<br/><br/>Whenever I try to recount the main events of the film's plot, I really can't make out a singular cohesive story. I can read analyses for this movie and probably figure out the baseline narrative but while watching the movie, I really did feel like I was subjected to a series of anthology scenes or something. In other words, a good portion of Lost Highway is just a bunch of surrealistic events happening one after another. This is not to say that Lynch dropped the ball on storytelling for this one though. I actually think, by going for such a fragmented and irregular plot structure, he creates an even more interesting story, as he always does. For Mulholland Drive, I talked about how we're presented different parts of the narrative that eventually flips. It's not very different in Lost Highway except that the pieces of the narrative that we're given are even more of a mystery, which makes the film so good and almost satisfying. David Lynch seems to constantly play with our expectations and feelings about what is supposed to, or could happen throughout the movie.<br/><br/>I also really love David Lynch's brand of horror. Somehow he's able to mix ambient music with artsy, still camera shots (upon given context) to create extremely unsettling scenes. The mere fact that there isn't a solid story to fall back on (while watching Lost Highway) after an intense scene can be scary in itself because the audience's expectations for what happens next could just go off the rails. This is a very strange film with unusual pacing and an extremely confusing plot. But there are enough hints that you feel like there must be some kind of deeper meaning. However, you'll never get a definite answer. You're not meant to. Human emotions and memories just aren't like that. Arguably the universe itself isn't like that. There are always exceptions to physical laws and weird phenomena that you thought were surely impossible that are actually possible. The important thing is that you *want* the answers, that you care about the characters and the story. And here you do, I guess mainly because the characters are very human and we see everything from their point of view. We relate to their fear, confusion, lust and curiosity.<br/><br/>David Lynch commits so strongly to his ideas that you can't just casually dismiss them. Laughter is infectious and so are visions when they're presented so earnestly. Lynch seems to believe in what he's doing so you have no choice but to go along for the ride. It's funny because most movies are full of plot holes anyway, they have so much exposition, so many unnecessary scenes. Typical plots where you can predict later developments. Screen writing that's just going through the motions. Everything is restricted to conventional reality and a linear sequence of events.<br/><br/>For me, movies are about ideas, emotions, themes, building tension, playing with expectations, a big climax. The aim is to affect an audience, make them laugh or cry or think or remember something. I think Lynch is a painter. His movies contain images that are hard to forget, they are very stylish. Your brain takes a longer time to process them, they enter your long-term memory in contrast to ordinary films that are often fun but instantly forgettable. His movies are more surreal or abstract, an aspect of film that seems almost completely untapped.<br/><br/>I think Patricia Arquette's role is one of the sexiest in any movie ever. She's soft and feminine and kind. She's in most of the movie. I really like the music. It's very moody and adds to the atmosphere a lot. Many of the shots are held a bit longer or shorter than what feels natural. It keeps you guessing, keeps the flow unpredictable. The acting is good, although most of the time the characters are just concerned or confused.<br/><br/>Lost Highway is very similar to Mulhulland Drive in many ways. In particular, both movies are split almost into two separate narratives with confusingly similar characters and plots. Like two alternate realities strangely interlinked. A common interpretation seems to roughly be that one story-line is reality while the other is a dream which explains why the same themes occur and why details partially overlap. Also the tone is similar, they're dark and sometimes scary.<br/><br/>I'm reminded of Rashomon and The Usual Suspects, where characters recount what happened and we see flashbacks but aren't sure quite how accurate they really are. Lynch's movies exist in that subconscious part of our mind where a person can abruptly morph into another person for reasons we don't understand. If movies are like books and musicals are like poetry, Lynch's movies are like stream-of-consciousness writing - maybe Ulysses.<br/><br/>It's exciting that this movie could have a totally different meaning for different people. I find his movies very entertaining just for their strangeness and creepiness. Horrors are meant to scare you in a fun way and thrillers should have you on the edge of your seat puzzled but fascinated. Lost Highway does both for me. I think Lynch understands the weird way our brains work and plays on that. I think his movies contain a lot of humour if you really get them. For me, Lost Highway was exciting, funny, confusing and probably won't ever completely leave my mind. Lynch's wildest story line. deftly realized. The intensity of the Jazz solo glimpsed briefly is a poster for the ride this film provides. How could a film be this uncomfortable to watch and so fascinating too? Only Lynch.<br/><br/>What this character is going through is like a class in German Expressionist agony. He is being manipulated by forces both sinister and mysterious, and there is no understanding any of it if you are him. For extra credit, the supernatural manipulation that his life becomes is shot in realistic, commonly found imagery. This is my favorite Lynch. I did not consider Mulholland Drive a stretch because I had already seen Lost Highway. I wish I had more than a poorly mastered Canadian DVD of it. Be prepared to watch multiple viewings of "Lost Highway". It's not that the film is confusing, the film is just that fascinating. You'll want to watch it again to see the narrative from a different angle or maybe catch something you missed. Possibly one of the most abstract and frustrating films ever made...and that's a compliment. Lynch is a great director but with "Lost Highway" he made his masterpiece. A truly intoxicating film, it not for every movie goer. It's a little out there for even "Twins Peak" standards.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around a sax playing husband Fred (Bill Pullman) who begins to suspect his wife is unfaithful. He soon discovers her past is connected to pornographic filmmakers and she mysteriously turns up dead. Sentenced for her murder, the husband supernaturally changes into a completely different person over night in his jail cell. Once released he meets a doppelganger of his deceased wife. What follows is the twisting and dark road of the lost highway.<br/><br/>It's a film that seems to be playing on multiple levels with several different interpretations being valid. Is it all a fantasy created by Fred? Is there something more sinister and supernatural occurring? Are we witnessing an alter version of events that transpired (Fred's discovery of his wife's betrayal)? It's all how the viewer interprets the narrative. A masterpiece of story telling and film making. Great performances all around. And Patricia Arquette in this film...Holy hell, she has to be the sexiest woman ever put on screen! See this film...with an open mind. Like watching a dream. Being a Lynch fan since his movie Dune (1984), where I was introduced with his work for the first time, I have always been very excited what's next he would bring. And he stunned me every time when I saw one of his movies. Only a handful of directors could manage that; David Lynch, Stanley Kubrick, David Cronenberg, Ingmar Bergman, Alfred Hitchcock, Akira Kurosawa. Im not talking about directors that made 2 or 3 epic movies in their entire lifetime. I'm talking about directors who have changed the way, format and concept of telling a story, in a time that was unusual for the time and place. Most of their movies left me either stunned, head filled with questions and/or pondering every now and then if I finally found a connection where I didn't see one. This movie is all that. I will not try to tell you the story of the movie, 'cause I don't like to take away of the mystery that the movie deserves. One of the things I realized early on is, if I read the story on the back of a rented movie, or saw a long trailer of a movie, I would wait for those things in the movie to happen. It takes so much of the movie magic away. Therefor I like to read short plot lines and watch teasers instead of trailers hehe. Lucky me, Lynch's Lost Highway is on the menu. If there was a rating for a movie that told a story parallel to a subconscious story, in my opinion this movie should be on the top 3 list of all time. I'm that serious. I loved everything this movie had to offer; excellent acting by everyone, managed to get a crush on a stunning Patricia Arquette (maybe the most underrated actress out there), scenes were utterly brilliantly constructed (imprinted in my memory forever), dialogs left you always wondering what it meant and I was desperately looking for connections or clues that would give me more insight to the whole thing. For this you need a master like Lynch. I have watched Lost Highway every 2 years since then (but when it came out, 3 times that week) and every time I watch it, it radiates that odd atmosphere. Brilliant in every way. Caught this at a Midnight screening last night (early this a.m.), and I have to say David Lynch's LOST HIGHWAY resonates a lot more loudly now than it did 13 years ago.<br/><br/>In fact, I not only didn't "get it" oh those many years ago, but I found it to be a "lesser" Lynch. So much so, that I waited till last night to revisit the film on the BIG SCREEN in all its wide-scree glory! (and the print was clean too)<br/><br/>***SPOILERS*** I had forgotten that Bill Pullman disappears completely from view halfway through the story, only to magically reappear at the end and save the day. I had also forgotten how much nudity Patricia Arquette exhibits to indulge Lynch's appreciation of the female form. She (as twins) has multiple sex scenes (indoors & out), and proves a most provocative of "femme fatales."<br/><br/>Lastly, I read IMDb's note about Robert Loggis's first meeting with Lynch at a "Blue Velvet" audition (Hopper got the part), and had to admire Loggia's dirty-old-man-gangster that could kick a tailgater's ass one minute and make B&W porno's for the pleasure of his entourage.<br/><br/>Although the story drags a little in the last reel, Lynch's use of voyeuristic video's (prior to Haneke's CACHE, 2005) and oddball doppelganger/wormhole-transport (pre-"DONNIE DARKO, 2001) is so ahead of its time the film could be released today and still catch fire.<br/><br/>Dial up your Midnight programmer and give this one another look ON THE BIG SCREEN!!!<br/><br/>3-1/2 stars (out of 4) -THEreelreviewer.com and best of Lynch. Gets a perspective on what jealousy might be. Plus successfully marries painting to narration. Like never before, so to speak.<br/><br/>Kind of reminds me of them days in the woods. For full appreciation, you gotta relax and let yourself take for a ride though. And better not be tailgated, because you wouldn't like the sound of something.<br/><br/>While watching closely, I'd recommend to remember: there's things that occur, and things that did. Which of them are shown on TV I couldn't be sure. Guess you gotta find out for yourself. It's fun anyway.<br/><br/>You could even come back to me, what I'd really appreciate, if you found out who that dog owns. Might well be the last, greatest mystery of mankind.<br/><br/>Thanks David. Great stuff. Lost highway is a masterpiece and a great puzzler that's sure to stay with you long after the movie ends. Lynch provides the film and you provide the explanation. You're sure to go through several iterations trying to fit this mystery into something that feels real. That's the fun of it. My latest guess has the main character as the mystery man.<br/><br/>Spoilers!! Most explanations have Fred as the main guy who morphs into Pete after a ride down the lost highway. But isn't Fred's life in suburbia pretty synthetic. The aloneness, the weird sound, the tapes, the overhead skylight, the dog barking somewhere. It's all a fantasy, so why can't Fred be a fantasy too? Why is he any more real than Pete? We only see one murder and it's the mystery man who does it. I 've just watched the film for the first time. After the end I was like "Duh?",kept bubbling "what the f**k did I just see".I probably stick to the interpretation that Fred killed his wife Renee, went to prison for it,and then the madness starts. He creates Pete and try to live a normal life but he is damned.Remember the line of MM "In Far Asia the ones who is sentenced to death, are going in a place that can't escape from it".Fred's transformation to Pete is a try to escape.But he can't.MM represents the "Truth that hurts".Anyway, no one can say that his explanation of the movie is right and the others are wrong.The way I see it,the film has multiple meanings,everyone chooses what suites him best.Lynch likes to do films like that.I love this guy! This picture is a hybrid of a thriller, art film, horror film and music video. It is in my view the culmination and peak of Lynch and Badalamentis collaboration, and is perhaps one of the most under-appreciated movies I know of, yet it has scores of devoted fans around. The follow-up production Mullholland Drive was far more successful, and had many similarities with Lost Highway, but lacked the same intense rawness, the possible nest-ups and interesting characters in my opinion. What is most fun with this film is that you wind up thinking of it long after seeing it to try to make sense of the story, which might be possible, but it wont necessarily be what others think. From seeing pathetic attempts on video covers on how to sum up the experience, I've learned not to make the same mistake. See the film, two or more times, its wort it, and the soundtrack rocks! "Lost Highway"... The very title entails an abnormality. Getting something wrong. Getting out of the route. I consider the movie as the most enigmatic one from among those which I have seen. I have watched it not once. Subsequently, I have made a conclusion that the plot of the movie is unexplainable. I think there could be no sure explanation of transformation of Fred Madison into Peter Dayton or duality of Renee Madison/Alice Wakefield. Certainly, every viewer might come forward with his/her understanding/vision of the happenings. But you should not mind the actual plot! The most important thing is that it is so fascinating, mystic, touching and prone to diverse interpretations. I find equally enchanting and very suited soundtrack of the movie. For me, D.Bowie's "I'm Deranged" is a special one, but all the tracks of the movie are so in place. As to actors, Bill Pullman suits the role of "deranged" Fred Madison, Patricia Arquette seems to be a true personification of sexually unsatisfied and insatiable woman, Robert Blake - hauntingly real Mystery Man, and, it seems to me, no one could forget Robert Loggia's (Mr Eddy/Dick Laurent) encounter with a speeding driver. To conclude, "Lost Highway" is a movie for a sheer pleasure of watching and irresolvable mysteries. David Lynch is the Director. i know that many people that have seen lost highway were amazed to the negative side. meaning they did not understand what was going on, who is against who and what should i feel after this. well, i don't know what about you but this film really made me appreciate lynch and see him as the most creative director of our time. he plays a game with the audience. the viewers try to figure out what's going on but suddenly everything changes to a point of no return. so much was already written about this film that it takes the mystery out of the film. so i will not try to explain the film here on IMDb but rather say that you have to be ready for a new kind of story telling, a new kind of look into the human psyche, a new kind of narrative formation and above all you should be ready to look at this film as an example of what cinema is all about. lost highway is first of all art and then it is entertainment. lynch knows how to entertain and the film does not lack of humor or sexiness. its got one of the best soundtracks ever recorded to film and it creates an experience you will not forget for a long time. after seeing all David lynch films i think this movie is lynch's best work and it concludes a non official trilogy of the same theme. the 3 trilogy movies are "eraserhead", "blue velvet" & "lost highway". in order to understand lynch's view of the world these 3 movies are his key works that explain in their own special way all his other works, such as "mulholland drive", "twin peaks" and even "the straight story" that has en eeri side to it also. this movie is a lynch must! This isn't a simple Hollywood style movie. Basically all the negative reviews I've read concern the fact that the story doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>Mainly I think because most people are accustomed to the simple storylines that basically all Major Hollywood movies serve up. The story does make sense in a certain way. Most people don't seem to pick up on that. If you watch closely you'll notice that certain events happen twice.<br/><br/>Just from different view points. Take the scenes involving Fred coming home from the party. You'll hear certain sounds. Those same sounds apear later on in the movie. Only seen from a different viewpoint. Same as the Dick Laurant Is Dead scene. My theory on that is that the characters are stuck in a time loop. Which would explain the weird occurance during the car chase at the end of the movie. Since right after that happens Fred is at his house again and mentions to himself that Dick Laurant Is Dead. And I think the Timeloop is caused by that Highway though the desert we keep seeing.<br/><br/>Anyway that's what me and a couple of friends concluded after discussing the movie a bunch of times.<br/><br/>Anyway I love this movie. Nice and disturbing. A gem among the garbage Hollywood usually produces. "Lost Highway" is generally regarded as Lynch's most incoherent and inaccessible film outside of "Eraserhead."  It certainly may be his darkest film both in image and mood.  (POTENTIAL SPOILERS) Essentially it tells the tale of a man driven by jealously to murder his wife and her lover and the fantasy world he creates for himself while awaiting the electric chair.  All the essential Lynch stuff is here: duality, multiple psychosis, homicidal tendencies, dangerous women, red curtains, electric disturbances, dead pan detectives, dream imagery, and non-linear storytelling.  Lynch does for wife killing here what he earlier did for incest/child killing in "Twin Peaks" and later did for suicide in "Mulholland Drive."  This film isn't quite as "fun" to try and figure out as "Mulholland Drive" but it still makes for a good mind bender, and you have to love the mid 90's goth metal soundtrack. With most Lynch films you are lulled into the dreamworld courtesy of composer Angelo Badalamenti's hypnotic and beautiful orchestrations, but here on this highway you are pounded into the psychogenic fugue of our protagonist with the likes of the Smashing Pumpkins, Nine Inch Nails, Rammstein, and David Bowie.  Also, the scenes with mystery man Robert Blake seem more disturbing and creepy than ever thanks to his current real life predicament on trial for killing his wife.  Lynch really seemed to tap into a certain LA mindset with this one and probably didn't even realize it. If the comments you're reading here have you intrigued with their polarised views, wondering whether you'll love or hate this film, don't bother seeing it.<br/><br/>But if the comments make you laugh, you'll probably love the film it.<br/><br/>Let it be known that this is one of my favourite films of all time. Having said that, it's a puzzle which has no solution and that is part of it's appeal.  You won't get a clear conclusion to your story here.  You may not even be sure of the storyline at all.  If these things concern you, don't waste your money.  For all the poor cliches this year about Kill Bill's mastery of "style", this film has style to make Kill Bill look like a mere drop in the ocean..<br/><br/>It's a mood piece, a character study, a story to decipher, and a good old fashioned thriller.  It's even a dialogue based comedy ala Woody Allen if you want it to be.  It's up to you which one you will see it as.<br/><br/>Don't waste your time.  If you like the unusual, the dark, the challenging and unique then buy this one.  If you are sceptical of art and don't like the pseudo-intellectual crowd, give it a miss.  Or if you aren't a judgemental fool, try watching it alone with a clear conscience and a lot of time to yourself.  There aren't any others like it.<br/><br/>I rate it 10 out of 10.  The only improvement I could suggest would be to spend some more money on superimposing the mystery man's face on Renee's whilst in bed.  But even the budget constraints have an appeal almost 10 years on. This is not an accessible film. It is also a work of genius. I suspect there are only a handful of people alive today capable of estimating it. They shall be the ones who have learned or understood what Lynch has to say for themselves, independently. The film serves as a confirmation that there are only a handful of such people.<br/><br/>In mind of that, I make only a fleeting observation, somewhat extraneous to the moment of this film, directed rather at the inability of the majority of the viewing public to face up to the reality of their existences. (Not that I seek to educate.)<br/><br/>People complain about irresolvabilities in the narrative which is or might be their viewing of Lost Highway. Yet somebody capable of creating a film as beautiful as The Elephant Man (1980), conforming to somewhat orthodox narrative structures, excelling at that, does not transgress such structures either lightly or unintentionally.<br/><br/>In a sense, this film cannot remind one what film is capable of (because it has no comparable predecessor). It rather determines what film is capable of.<br/><br/>One could rarely say of a film of this moment that one could not have wished to have made it simply because one could not then have had the benefit of purely viewing it. Lynch has succeeded in disbenefitting himself only in this way.<br/><br/>Camden Town, 1997; Everyman, Hampstead, 1998; L'Entreport, Paris, 2 Jan 1999; L'Entreport, Paris, 11 Sept 1999 I've seen this movie many times, and eventually after sinking enough money into renting it repeatedly, bought the tape.  I've watched it many times with a variety of friends, and very few people seem to really enjoy it, because this is not a movie to watch over pizza and beer.  The movie takes significantly longer to watch than the running time, and needs somewhat constant pausing to contemplate what happens.  Several times while watching it for the first time, you will rewind the tape a few moments to notice a bit more about the scene.  This is a movie for someone who wants to think about what they see and about how they process what they're seeing.  It's great for anyone who appreciates art, psychological introspection, and contemplation of the supernatural / natural links in the world. I buy this movie like the Lynch fan that I am. It's perfect, it has a great rythym, excellent photography. The takes on the first hour are great, is like the Goddard style. The Soundtrack is a selection of dark that helps the work of the editor, a lot. The script is great, I think Lynch is the only one that can direct a script like this.<br/><br/>David, keep travelling in the dark side I recently picked up Lost Highway in an ex-rental store - for £1.99. (Along with Jackie Brown and Dark City also for the same price.) A bargain I thought.<br/><br/>After spending what seemed like a year of my life watching it, (although it was only a Sunday evening/afternoon) I felt I'd been robbed!<br/><br/>
As the end credits rolled I released a startled, choked laugh of surprise, which woke my girlfriend who was sleeping on the couch next to me -she couldn't even remain conscious throughout it's duration - and when she asked me what happened, I was at a loss to offer an explanation.. As would most people be.<br/><br/>But - I'm not a dumb ass - and I knew I'd seen something genuinely original. After dwelling on it for a while, primarily the credit sequences - that hurtling road and Bowie's fantastic song Deranged, - I simply can't wait to watch it again. Three days later and I'm still thinking about it!<br/><br/>I'm a fan of cheesy films, independent films, violent films, chaotic - disruptive anarchic films - good films or bad films - I don't care (hence my hysteria at watching the cornball `ghosts of mars' - it was *FUN*) - as long as they are entertaining - or have some justification in their being made in the first place. As so many films these days are made simply to expand the coffers of the studios so they can release more and more idiotic tales of stupid sentimentality and right wing propaganda.  I like films that get by on their own merits  - not by just having big name actors mug and wink at each other - which is why `Harold and Maude' is a better love story than `Sleepless in Seattle' and `Notting Hill' and their nauseating ilk will ever be! I just like films - period - I also write screenplays and novels too, it doesn't make me any more qualified mind - I'm just a big fan of cinema and the medium of film as both an art form and an entertainment media.<br/><br/>In fact the only films I dislike are the patronising formulaic studio crap - sequels, Julia Roberts/ Demi Moore vehicles etc. mindless action films, unless they have originality or personality, (like Jackie Chan for example - I can forgive him anything as he's fantastic) and Lost Highways staunchly anti-commercial, anti-narrative, hypnotic and hectic collusion of images and scenes, the dreamlike storyline that atrophies into a disturbing, insane loop, makes it a contender for my film of the year!  - Or at least the film that I like seemingly just to confound my friend's as they never get them and think I am deliberately doing it to be highbrow!<br/><br/>If you can relate to my tastes then you'll probably like it - if you enjoyed the uneccessary "Planet of the apes" remake/ debacle/ reinterpretation, then you'll find this very heavy going!<br/><br/>What you get with Lost Highway is an open-ended narrative that deliberately explains nothing and blurs both the accepted cinematic rules and visual vocabulary of what we expect in modern movies. It's a free form, lazy, almost easy-going nightmare that glides hauntingly and quietly from one surreal scene to the next - some are simply gripping in their intensity, others alienating in their sparse, Pinter-esque dialogues. Characters are dispassionate, guarded creatures that show little emotion, and the sinister Mystery man in black, comes across as the most interesting, but is also sadly afforded the least screen time.<br/><br/>Overall - if you watch this film expecting to follow a story and passively allow the visuals to narrate to you, then you'll be disappointed - and big time! But if you are tired of knowing what is going to happen next when you watch a film, and are sick of the sight of the same few industry assholes getting paid millions, and confusing their pay-checks with their talent, then watch this dangerous and unpredictable masterpiece of the surreal and enjoy it as a unique piece of visual artistry.<br/><br/>It's not Lynch's best  - I'm a big fan of Blue Velvet and Wild At Heart (although I do find some parts hard to take!) But he's undeniably an intriguing intelligent filmmaker, and worthy of support. There maybe difficult moments where you may lose the thread, but it's worthy of perseverance if you are interested in expanding your movie-going tastes.<br/><br/>
It's not perfect - perhaps only Halloween and Star Wars are the only true ideals in capturing their respective genres and remaining unequalled masterpieces - You do have to invest an amount of attention to enjoy this film, and even use your brain while you watch it, but it's a hell of a lot better way to spend a winters evening than watching something like pearl bloody habroror, or whatever.<br/><br/>I can honestly say that, now after seeing the film, I can understand why there was nothing in the way of a description or a synopsis on the back of the video box!<br/><br/>7/10 Unique, flawed, disjointed, confusing, unsettling, disturbing - Great. After recently re-viewing 'Lost Highway' I'd say it has surpassed 'Blue Velvet' as my favourite David Lynch movie, and would go as far as to say that it is his definitive statement (so far). All the promise shown since 'Eraserhead' back in the 1970s has been fulfilled with this movie, and then some.<br/><br/>I've read many interesting theories about the relationships between Fred Madison (Bill Pullman) and Pete Dayton (Balthazar Getty), or between Renee Madison (Patricia Arquette) and Alice Wakefield (Patricia Arquette), or who the Mystery Man (Robert Blake) "really" is, both by fans and detractors, and even co-author Barry Gifford, but they're just that THEORIES. The beauty of this strange and haunting movie is that it is a puzzle with no "solution".<br/><br/>
Like most of Lynch's  movies, or Antionioni's classic 'Blowup' or the surreal films of Bunuel or Jodorowsky, or the enigmatic novels of Kafka or Kobo Abe, "what it's really about" is up to you, the viewer. You get out of it what you put in. Some people can't handle that and want things to be clear, and obvious, and have "meaning". Those people should steer clear of 'Lost Highway'! But movie lovers who are willing to try a bit harder, who are willing to enter a strange place and see what happens, will absolutely love this movie. My advice is to treat it like a dream (or more like a nightmare!) on film, like the best movies of Dario Argento, or Herk Harvey's stunning one-off (and major Lynch influence) 'Carnival Of Souls'. Watch first, sleep on it, and ask questions later. 'Lost Highway' is a movie that will stay with you for years! One of the decades greatest achievements. This movie has incredible lighting, and the colors used in the movie are hypnotic. This is also a movie which you can't say: "O, its a comedy, drama, horror, action or country movie, because it's all that at once! This is what I admire of David Lynch in this thick movie. Even the music from the film is very diverse. David Bowie, Rammstein, the Smashing Pumpkins and then Lou Reed. =) Who can pull this off? Only Lynch.... Lost Highway is undoubtedly one of the most striking movie of all time. It sometimes resembles a contemporary art installation or video, but it's also both an Hitchcockian thriller dealing with identity and an experimental, almost underground film. The photography is superb and the actors, as always with Lynch, reach unknown territories where no one would have expected them to go. The musical score is ironic and modern. Lost Highway is something rare and precious: an attempt by a famous director to explore modern urban mythology without any of the tricks of the trade most film-makers use. It is free as art itself, violent and puzzling. It shows images never seen or fantasized before. It is a masterpiece! David Lynch has made some good films, Wild At Heart, Blue Velvet, and in these films, he has often trod that fine line between weirdness/surreal and gibberish.  This film is horrible, self indulgent, and what looks like a desperate attempt to repeat the "weirdness" of some of his better works. But it's a mess. Lack of anything vaguely resembling a coherent plot aside, the film fails to register its audience with any intelligence. Odd, intriguing situations are presented but like something out of a "cop-out" writers class, these themes and incidents are never followed up or ignored. This is lazy film making parading as art. It amazes me how people will call something art, just because it doesn´t make sense.  "I don´t get it, so the artist (writer, direstor, whatever) must be genuis!"  Don´t be fooled.  D.Lynch had a bad dream and decided to make it into a movie.  Just like dreams it doesn´t make sense.  People and locations change.  There is no discernible plot.  By the time the movie ends, you´ll be wondering why it ended here of all places when the merciful thing to do would have been to end it after half an hour. If anything this movie proves that if you´ve got a big name you can make crap and people will love it. I gave the movie 1 out of 10.  I wanted to give it 0, but 1 is the lowest you can give.  So it gets a "1" for the first half hour which was kinda spooky. The truth is it was boring. Slow, tedious, holiness, indulgent.<br/><br/>Really, really indulgent. Not as pretentious and nonsensical as David Lynch's more recent movies, this is still pretty random. Starts as a decent enough mystery-drama, at some point it just takes a random detour and never fully gets back on track. Troubled by a thought. This is the tale of a horrible ladybug (and other ladybugs). Murderer of innocent aphids. The aphids are just trying to live their lives. The dastardly humans help the ladybugs destroy the aphids. A cloud drifts past the scene. The cloud puts on its headphones, not wanting to listen to the echoing sorrows. "I love David Lynch (director of "Mulholland Drive" and "Eraserhead"). I think he's a brilliant, though sometimes dense, director that asks the questions many people are unwilling or unable to ask- the kinds of questions that make us ask why we're here, what existence is all about, that sort of thing.<br/><br/>When Lynch is at his peak ("Eraserhead", "Mulholland") I think you could pit him against any director that ever lived, and he'd still hold his ground; I don't think this is peak Lynch, however. I liked this movie, more and more the longer I think about it, but I did not love it like I did some of his other films (though it is a heck of a lot better than "Dune").<br/><br/>I suppose it should go without saying that this film is freaking weird, most Lynch films are; while this film isn't as weird as "Eraserhead" I'd say it's weirdness is about on par with "Mulholland Drive". The problem is that, with this film, I'm not entirely sure what Lynch is getting at. "Eraserhead" has moments of total surreal bizarreness, but I could always tell that the overall film was more or less about anxiety surrounding parenthood, and how that anxiety is universal; everyone from Henry as the parent of his deformed child, to God and his children here on earth feels some kind of nervousness when bringing forth new life. "Eraserhead" takes it a step further- is it proper to even bring life into a world so cold and strange? Even though there were certain scenes that I couldn't tell you exactly what the meaning was, the overall result still left me feeling satisfied, as if Lynch had shed light on some questions I had never asked myself.<br/><br/>In "Lost Highway" I felt as if I got the general gist- many of the scenes were saying certain things, many scenes were incredibly memorable and meaningful (some, downright terrifying)- but overall I was still left feeling as if I'd missed some of the depth I usually feel with Lynch's other films. I also think that Lynch is an incredibly smart filmmaker, and there are Eastern philosophy influences that I probably am not as familiar with as he, so I'll be the first to admit some of the more nuanced moments might've gone over my head. To me, the biggest clue about this film's meaning came from the Mystery Man (Robert Blake, "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre") when he was talking to Pete Dayton (Balthazar Getty, "Feast") over the phone; in that scene the Mystery Man says: "In the East, the Far East, when a person is sentenced to death, they're sent to a place where they can't escape, never knowing when an executioner may step up behind them, and fire a bullet into the back of their head." In short: Watch this. Several times. You might find it annoying the first time, after that you're going to start enjoying it. SPOILERS BELOW.<br/><br/>The first time I watched Lost Highway, it seemed to be a surreal drama about a man wrongly accused of murdering his wife and an unrelated young man going about his life. I mean, in every film like this the character is always innocent, right? Then the two plotlines merged, things became extremely hard to discern and I left the film feeling irritated and confused.<br/><br/>The second time I watched Lost Highway, it was clearly a surreal drama about a completely insane murderer deluding himself into imagining he hadn't killed his wife! It was then that the genius of this film began to dawn upon me. It actively takes expectations of the thriller genre and completely rewrites them to chilling effect.<br/><br/>At this point David Lynch's name is pretty much a by-word for surreal insanity with meaning behind it, and this film is the epitome of his style. Many criticise the opening of the film as "too slow", but for me it's the most brilliant part of the film, and one of the most amazing build-ups I've seen in a film. For that reason I will cover it in depth below.<br/><br/>We have Fred (Bill Pullman) living in his flat with his wife Renee (Patricia Arquette). Firstly, the set design tells the story and this is one area in which the film is incredibly clever and rewards repeated viewing.<br/><br/>Fred's "man cave" is at one end of the building, and Renee never enters it. Renee spends her time preening in the bathroom at the other side of the building. The one time Fred attempts to enter she gives him a cold and disapproving look and he is rebuffed; even before we get to the dialogue or what's going on, the mere design of the set tells us these characters are distant and growing apart.<br/><br/>Next we have superb visual metaphors again doing the storytelling for us. Fred is a jazz musician, and plays frenetic and headache inducing jazz at the "Luna Bar", a name calling up the phrase lunatic. He hallucinates seeing his wife there and becomes jealous and suspicious.<br/><br/>We see a sinister cloud of smoke rising from Fred's front door. On your first viewing this is merely confusing and you have no idea what this means. When you watch it again with a different perspective it's disturbing - this is Fred arriving home, not as a human, but instead a primal cloud of irrational rage and hatred.<br/><br/>The opening ends with Fred walking slowly and unnaturally into a shadowy hallway, and then sluggishly emerging again from the darkness. He has made that decision to give wholeheartedly into his inner evil. To become his dark doppelganger, a motif also explored in Twin Peaks.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most disturbing visual I've ever seen in a film is the aftermath of the murder of Renee, which we only see once very briefly and under heavy distortion, as if it's being videotaped. Fred sits on the floor, laughing hysterically (*laughing*!) and gurning psychotically, covered in blood and surrounded by the mutilated torso and limbs of his own wife. He doesn't even remember doing this later in the film, which is perhaps a mercy.<br/><br/>This one piece of horror is almost censored by its brevity of a few seconds, yet Lynch makes that one moment profoundly and almost boundlessly disturbing, driving the whole movie onwards.<br/><br/>This is an everyman who is our protagonist, who you probably believed was innocent on the first watch...but he's a man capable of not only killing his wife, but completely losing his sanity and defiling her corpse as well. This short one completely deranged shot is flipped on it's head, becoming the one piece of actual truth in the movie. It's the rest of the film which is Fred's deranged delusion!<br/><br/>Other standouts include the performance of Robert Blake as the unblinking, inhuman and incomprehensible Mystery Man. He is the very embodiment of sinister and I've not seen a film character like him since. Is he the Devil? Is he Fred's jealousy? His insanity? His inner evil? There is never a clear answer; the only obvious fact is that Robert Blake knocks this role out of the park.<br/><br/>I'm aware this has been a long review, but I really wanted to draw attention to the expertise in crafting an insane but coherent narrative that Lynch displays here, even with he first 30 minutes of the movie. Highly recommended, this gets 10/10 from me. After many years of watching David Lynch's films, I've finally stopped trying to figure them out. Instead of wrestling w/ endless theories, it's much more enjoyable to simply allow Lynch's ghastly universe to unfold in all of its dreadful glory. LOST HIGHWAY is the Director's neo-psycho-noir masterpiece of nonsensical, palpable, choking doom. Jazz saxophonist, Fred Madison (Bill Pullman) is convicted of murdering his impossibly hot wife, Renee (Patricia Arquette). This has something to do w/ someone who had secretly videotaped them while they slept. While in prison, world's collide, and Fred wakes up as younger, auto mechanic, Pete Dayton (Balthazar Getty). Thrust into a netherworld of crime, Pete romances the forbidden wife (Arquette again) of notorious mob boss, Mr. Eddy (Robert Loggia). This is enough to know, since its all just a wonderful dreamscape for Lynch to play around in anyway! Loggia is menacing and hilarious in his explosive role (he also plays Dick Laurent), and Robert Blake steals every scene he's in as the sinister, seemingly omniscient Mystery Man! His eyes burn holes right through the screen! Bleak and convoluted, Lynch stirs violence and sensuality in w/ an unsettling atmosphere, creating quite a creepy stew! Another unique puzzle-box from Lynch's attic of the unknown... "We've met before, haven't we..."<br/><br/>Chilling words from a stranger...made even more chilling thanks to the smiling, devilish performance from Robert Blake who plays the horrifying Mystery Man, a major piece to the brilliant puzzle that is "Lost Higway".<br/><br/>"Highway" is one of Lynch's most accessible surrealist works, but that does not mean it is not at all challenging or mindbending or experimental, it has all of those elements firmly in place and more. It is a wild, entertaining, and enigmatic ride powered by a storm of engaging twists, dark plots, and unique visuals. The lighting gives it a glossy, exaggerated look, almost as if it were some kind of cross between a whimsical fantasy and stylized hard boil detective flick, but it is neither of these things. What is it, you may ask? It is a David Lynch film, I will respond. And that is all you need to know.<br/><br/>It is scary and brilliant and dark, it embraces speculation and analysis while also remaining coherent, its story and characters are enough to keep the viewer engaged; the more difficult riddles and metaphors are interwoven with action and music and horror and drama, it's a non stop rocket ride through Hell, it's a plunge into the darkness of death, that everlasting, unwinding road with the power to mesmerize, confuse, and frighten. <br/><br/>The way I see it, the film can be split into three lose parts. Part one is pure Lynchian surrealism, it is deliberately slow and yet it still keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat, always anticipating the next move a character may take, the next dramatic shift in the story. Its atmosphere is one of absolute dread and unbearable if often unexplained tension, it is Lynch doing what he does best. The second part speeds things up a bit. Sexy, funny, fast paced, and bizarre, it's easily the most digestible and coherent part of the movie, encapsulating the mood of a film noir and a 90's crime thriller peppered with heavy doses of the surreal...and it steadily inclines into the third half, where things get really weird. It's a cross between the surrealistic, blood curdling, mind blowing horror of the first half and the fun, exciting weirdness of the second, culminating in one huge avant garde masterpiece work watching over and over and over again, allowing that vision of the infinite highway to swallow whatever is left of your soul and haunt your nights for all the years to come... There really is little point to add another review here, except well, I should for my own collection of reviews obviously have something on what I feel is STILL - probably - the best film ever made: although, oddly (like the film - odd!) initially having caught it on very first release, in a small (almost fleapit) theatre in D.C. (Washington), I got that 'what the heck was that all about?', the master has indeed lost not only his highway, but his grip / the plot! Talk about bewildered as you leave the theatre blinking into the daylight. So I empathise with any that feel this is nonsense! Ah, but wait, give it a second chance to reassess: <br/><br/>Rather as like myself, one year on - (and pre all too soon video (DVD) home use releases) - it came on TV and having adored his earlier efforts, had to watch again to give benefit of doubt was an aberration in his oeuvre and possibly so reassess: and by which, just coincidentally, was set up to also hear, too, on the recently invested in, (then rapidly proliferating), home theatre set up sound system: and in that (aural) sense, finally, it stood- sounded - out mightily superb: since having known what was to unfold - so, knowing likely not able to make much (mundane) narrative sense to it - and so is the reason I'm adding this here, since, otherwise, really, what could I add that might be useful (new?) that hasn't already been mulled over countless times? Since otherwise, there'd really be little reason to add my take on it other than to recommend this: if you have already seen it once, then counter-intuitively, DON'T try to work it out; rather just let the images and weirdness wash over you. <br/><br/>That's all. Indeed, even let go of the obvious movie use sense of 'viewing', so that for a change rather than intently watch, trying to work out the unlikely unworkoutable, just listen to it: the soundtrack and design (Lynch himself with long time compatriot Badalamenti) is an experience to savour on its own: as for example, as the most disturbing, (likely snuff inference?) home porn movie scene approaches, as characters career down corridors and the ominous sorta chop chop helicopter like opening bars of Ramstein's eponymous 'tune' chimes in, surreptitiously ramp up the volume on your home sound system: as the Teutonic cacophony crashes through, it'll startle and raise the hackles on ya neck even more and add to the fearful paranoia that Lynch has masterfully inveigled you into. <br/><br/>Other than that, I wouldn't dare to try and interpret it: (Coz it's a fugue, innit? Or what?) it's best left entirely to your own impression (e.g. disjointed claptrap - or deeply disturbing take on the mysterious power of alternative personality (DID = largely dismissed Disassociative Individual Disorder?) manifestation, that may likely affect those that have power and control over us?!  Opps! There, still sneaked in my take!), and just be grateful, Lynch did decide not only to put it together, but also originally for proper appreciation on on the big screen, too. <br/><br/>(Oh, and if you have the spare time, then a must to try and triple bill it with similar themed, companion pieces, 'Mulholland Dr.' and 'Inland Empire'.)<br/><br/>Truly masterful from a cinematic genius master: there, that's my take / recommendation done. "Lost Highway" is undoubtedly one of David Lynch's masterpieces. All of Lynch's films are challenging. He rarely uses a linear plot structure and the line between what is real and what is imagined is usually blurred. "Lost Highway" is one of the most difficult films to interpret, but it can still be enjoyed even if you don't fully understand everything on the screen. The acting is very good. Pullman pulls off Fred's nervous demeanor perfectly and Arquette is suitably mysterious. I particularly liked Robert Loggia's performance and he oozed menace every time he was on the screen. Robert Blake as the Mystery Man sent shivers down my spine and he didn't always seem human. As well as a cameo from Marilyn Manson, watch out for a glimpse of Henry Rollins as a prison guard. The choice of music perfectly matches the mood. We hear from Rammstein, Trent Reznor, Marilyn Manson, Lou Reed, This Mortal Coil, and many others. The whole thing is held together by Angelo Badalamenti's haunting score.<br/><br/>The mystery man is truly the most fascinating aspect of this movie. In my opinion, he is Fred's idea of the "devil". He has supernatural powers and he feeds off the sins of mortals. The scene at the party is one of the creepiest movie scenes I've seen, yet at the same time it is hilarious. The way the music and party noise fade when the mystery man and Fred walk up to each other created a bizarre and surreal exchange. Another great scene of the movie is when Mr. Eddy and the mystery man call Pete together. "Yeah Pete, I just wanted to jump back on and let you know I'm glad your OK!" Click. That was great. And of course, I can't talk about the great scenes in the movie without mentioning the "tailgating" scene. Robert Loggia (Mr. Eddy) is a master. "Lost Highway" is a must-see. I still don't have all the answers and I know they'll never come. But it's the mood and eerie visual images (the reverse shot of the exploding cabin, like a premonition)that make this film so brilliant (and some awesome music tracks). This film will haunt you for years to come.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 9 out of 10. David Lynch's Lost Highway is a fuzzy, feverish portrait of a fractured mind attempting to make sense of extremely distressing circumstances that are both alienating and possibly self inflicted. Lynch is always keen on probing the cerebrally murky waters which border on the potentially paranormal occurrences, and the often frustrating line, or lack thereof, which is drawn in, around and between these two aspects. Psychological terror, ambiguous scenes that leave you scratching your head once you've caught your breath, identity crisis, elliptical narratives that leave us haunted and wanting more are all tools in his bag, ones he's employed countless times throughout his monolithic career. Usually he implements that in an esoteric, earthy way, but there's something cold, clinical and unsettlingly voyeuristic about this that somewhat separates it from a lot of other stuff he's done. The term 'Lynchian' in itself has become its own genre, there's no debating that anymore. It's usually within this self made genre that he explores, but it's almost like with this one he went in with a mindset to play around with a sordid, almost De Palma-esque style of genre, and then inject it with his trademark eerie weirdness, in this case to great effect. Bill Pullman stars as jazz trumpet player Fred, spending his nights belting out unnerving solos in smoky clubs. Pullman is an all American prototype, seen in a lot of generic, regular Joe roles. Seeing him venture into sketchy material is jarring and super effective (see his career best work in David's daughter Jen Lynch's Surveillance for an even better example of this). He and his gorgeous wife (Patricia Arquette) wake up one ominous morning to discover a packaged video tape on their doorstep, the contents of which show someone breaking into their house and filming them while they sleep. They feel both horrified and violated, and call the police who prove to be just south of useful. From there things get terrifically weird. Fred attends a party where he meets the Mystery Man (Robert Blake) who plays a mean spirited magic trick on him that will have your skin crawling out the door. This was one of Blake's last two roles before the unfortunate incident that cut his career painfully short, but he's perfect for Lynch's stable and eats up the frames he inhabits, a pasty faced ghoul with beady black jewels for eyes and a piercing laugh that will stain your psyche for years. Before he knows it, Fred wakes up and is accused for his own wife's murder, whisked away to a dank death row cell, plummeting the film into a new segment, Lynch's way of letting us know this isn't going to be an easy watch. Fred wakes up sometime later... And isn't Fred anymore. He's a young lad with amnesia whose been missing for a while, played by edgy Balthazar Getty. It's a stark left turn for the plot to take, a stinging reminder that from there on out, we're in for some nasty antics with no light at the end of the tunnel. Getty is released from prison, since he's not Pullman who they arrested to begin with. From there he gets entangled in a hot mess of a subplot involving a volatile gangster (Robert Loggia), his seductive wife (also Patricia Arquette) and the ever present Mystery Man who lurks over both planes of the film's narrative. I'm trying to be deliberately vague about the plot (lord knows Lynch did as well), both to not spoil any surprises for you, and partly because after many viewings, I'm still not sure exactly what it means for myself. It's a great big clusterfuck of extremely disturbing sequences, surreal passages of auditory and visual madness and a frothing undercurrent of atmosphere that constantly pulls on your sleeve to remind you that something is terribly wrong, but never gives you the solace of telling you what that something is. Traumatic viewing to say the least. Lynch assembles an extraterrestrial supporting cast including Michael Massee, Jack Nance, Natasha Gregson Warner, Marilyn Manson, Henry Rollins, Mink Stole, Jack Kehler, Giovanni Ribisi, Richard Pryor and the one and only Gary Busey (when Gary is one of the calmest, sanest people in your movie you know you've driven off the cliff). Some highlights for me are anything to do with Blake's paralyzing spectre of a character who is one of the best Lynch creations ever, Loggia intimidating an obnoxious driver is priceless and the closest the film gets to comedy, and the final twenty minutes where the lines of reality, fantasy and the jagged planes of perception within the characters minds collide, providing us with a creepy non-resolution, part of what makes the entire show so memorable and affecting. A classic that begs countless re-watches before it can fully cast all aspects of its spell on you, and one of Lynch's unsung best. Are you confused? or disturbed? or paranoid? or turned on? or all of the above? If you've answered "All of the above", congratulations, you've had a terrific David Lynch experience. Lost Highway isn't one of Lynch's better known films. Perhaps its not as whimsically demented as Eraserhead or as nightmarish as Blue Velvet. But PLEASE don't let this one pass you by. This is a terrific mind-bender. This movie creeps you out in the best ways Lynch can. He leaves us hanging with a few mysterious characters, all of whom not knowing who they are, and more importantly, not knowing what they're doing. At the picture's end, we still don't know.. but we've enjoyed the wild ride while it lasted. Terrific performances abound. Patricia Arquette is at her best here, I definitely got an Alabama Whitman vibe here. The cameos are the best. An insane Robert Loggia, a strangely subdued Gary Busey. Legendary comedian Richard Pryor given merely (and I'm not joking) a minute of screen time.. and he kills it. But the best part, and undoubtedly the creepiest character and element of this picture is Robert Blake. Terrifying is a word that appropriately describes him here. It doesn't help that he's Robert Blake either. "Lost Highway" is a David Lynch film from 1997 and, like most David Lynch films, it's hard to describe, hard to understand, and even after you've described it, you haven't told anyone what it's about because it's not about what you just described.<br/><br/>Bill Pullman is Fred Madison, a saxophone player sitting on Death Row for the murder of his wife (Patricia Arquette).<br/><br/>In the beginning of the movie, a tape is delivered to Fred and Renee's home. It shows the front of their house, but each tape sent shows more and more of the house, including the inside. The film "Cache" does a similar thing, with tapes of the house being sent. Cache is also a film that causes a lot of discussion, and the director is probably a devotee of Lynch.<br/><br/>Fred is ultimately filmed with Renee's dead body, though he remembers nothing. He's found guilty and is on death row, though he is tortured by the fact that he really doesn't know what happened to Renee. As a result he has bad headaches and can't sleep.<br/><br/>He goes to the prison doctor, who asks him how he's sleeping, and he says not well. The doctor gives him pills and says, "You'll sleep now." Thus begins Fred's dream.<br/><br/>In Mulholland Drive, the film begins with a dream; here, the dream comes a little later. And you know how dreams are -- things are different, people are different, everything is askew.<br/><br/>In the dream, Bill Pullman becomes Balthazar Getty who plays a mechanic, Pete Dayton. The dream becomes a noir, complete with a femme fatale (Arquette). In the beginning of the film, Arquette has straight black hair as Fred's wife. Now she's a blond named Alice, who is trying to help him find answers. Pete Dayton wakes up in prison, but he gets out and seeks revenge. He knows what happened to Renee. In Fred's dream, Pete sees The Lost Highway Hotel, where Renee had liaisons with Dick Laurent (Robert Loggia), who heads a crime syndicate.<br/><br/>If you just sat through this film, you wouldn't have any idea what was happening except that it's dark and strange and the characters seem to wind up as other people. The thing with Lynch is it's a dream world where not everything makes sense. In this case, it may be the dream world of a schizophrenic.<br/><br/>Lynch's movies feel like dreams -- they're disturbing and something is not quite right. People make weird statements. Does it all mean something? Probably, but I don't think we're meant to know everything.<br/><br/>Another fascinating film from David Lynch. This is not a psycho-analysis or a review of Lost Highway's artistic merits. It is only an explanation FOR THOSE WHO HAVE ALREADY SEEN IT. And since you have already seen it I will skip telling the story and only decode it for you.<br/><br/>The "real" backdrop of the movie is this: a man has murdered his wife on suspicion of infidelity. He is sentenced to death by electrocution. While in prison he creates a flashback and a flash-forward. The movie runs linearly through these mental compositions, beginning with the flashback and ending in the flash-forward. The flashback is the man's attempt to understand how he ended up in prison. He then creates a flash-forward to project a fantasy. The flashback informs the flash-forward and both are entirely informed by the reality that led the man to commit the murder in the first place.<br/><br/>FLASHBACK: The first 40 minutes or so of the movie are the flashback. In this Fred lives with his wife Renee, who he believes is cheating on him. Hints that this is unarguably a mental construct are: 1) Renee is constantly in heels, even when she is in a nightgown and fresh out of bed. 2) The video tapes. 3)The mystery man. Renee is constructed as a seductress. The videotapes are messages from the murderer's subconscious trying to tell him he murdered his wife. The mystery man is an embodiment of jealousy/rage whom the murderer himself "let into his house." Fred tells the detectives, "I like to remember things in a particular way." This flashback leads him to where he actually is; in prison.<br/><br/>FLASH-FORWARD: In this fantasy he is the exact opposite of Fred. He is Pete, young, reckless, wild, and cuckolding another, much stronger man (Laurent). The woman is the same person as his wife in the flashback except in this flash-forward fantasy she is won by him (Pete) and ALSO more explicitly imagined as an out-of-control prostitute/amateur porn star/nymphomaniac who ultimately wants to be with him. The mystery man as embodiment of rage/jealousy first appears in this phase as the cuckolded Laurent's friend. When Pete kills Andy and he and Alice escape to the shed where they copulate successfully - even though at the end Alice tells Pete (who by now visually transforms into Fred) "you can never have me" because in reality she is dead. But then Alice disappears and the mystery man sends Fred back to the motel to abduct and ultimately kill Laurent. He in fact helps Fred kill Laurent after showing Laurent what Laurent is being killed for through the mystery man's video-phone. In this sense the mystery man is not specifically the murderer's jealousy/rage but jealousy/rage in general (hence appearing by Laurent when Laurent suspects he is being cuckolded). At the end Fred returns to his apartment and lets Fred from the opening scene (flashback Fred) know that Laurent is dead. This isn't a resolution of a through-line but hints at the loop in the murderer's mind where he will probably go over different variations of these two mental compositions over and over as he awaits his electrocution. <br/><br/>In the "real" sequence of events the murderer probably suspected his wife of sleeping with a Laurent. After killing her in a fit of madness, his subconscious attempts to tell him what happened (in the flashback, through the videotapes) while in the flash-forward his imagination/fantasy constructs elaborate characteristics of the two objects of his jealousy/rage: Laurent as a tough gangster whom he cuckolds and kills (this is his mind saying "I banged your girl and killed you mofo - ultimate revenge), and Renee as a nymphomaniac with overly transgressive sexual inclinations (this is his mind saying "man, she loved me but boy was she a slut"). In either case the mystery man is the embodiment of jealousy/rage. In a recent interview, renowned Indian painter and film maker M.F. Husain revealed that 'Cow,Umbrella+Lantern-shoe=Woman' was the original title that he had thought for his short film 'Through the eyes of a Painter.' When a few members of the film division complained that they didn't quite understand the film, he replied that it is not a mathematical equation like E=Mc2, which one can logically explain, but merely a visual equation, that has no particular solution. David Lynch's Lost highway is no different. Its not a coincidence that David Lynch also started his career as a painter. This movie shows us that it is not always necessary for some one to solve the puzzles of a story in a cinema in order to enjoy it. Unlike the movies that I have seen on schizophrenia, this one doesn't deal with the decease itself, but explore the surrealistic possibilities associated with it by creating the mood though perfect background score and light play and make it a enjoyable cinematic experience. One should be able to enjoy this journey even if he may not find his destination. The essence and grammar of the movie is nothing but what the character Fred rightly explains when he explains why he hates video cameras. "I like to remember things my own way. How I remembered them. Not necessarily the way they happened." This is like a complicated jigsaw puzzle, only when you finally fit the whole thing together you discover that each piece is from a different jigsaw puzzle -- part of a cowboy boot here, a puppy dog's nose here, a chunk of an El Greco skyscape somewhere else. It's one of David Lynch's less coherent efforts but I couldn't take my eyes off it.<br/><br/>Okay. Here's what I make of the story. I'm going to try to cut some of the diverting flab off it. Bill Pullman and Patricia Arquette (in a long auburn wig) have one of those marriages where the couple no longer has much to say to one another. At a dull party, an eerie Robert Blake pulls some supernatural stunt while conversing with him. They really are supernatural. Puzzled, unhappy, Pullman gets his wife and they leave. Then Pullman begins to get headaches and nightmares. Suddenly, he's found leaning over his wife's battered body and sentenced to death.<br/><br/>So he's sitting in his death-row cell, right?, a little gloomy, and he begins to get a really TERRIFIC headache. One of the corrections officers hears the commotion, strolls over and takes a peek through the cell window. Then he calls his boss over. "Captain," he says shakily, "there's some really spooky s*** going on here." And indeed there is. Bill Pullman has changed into Balthazar Getty. Getty is properly identified and, the cops having no reason to hold him, allow him to go back to his job as an expert mechanic at an auto shop run by poor Richard Pryor, disabled by the disease that would finally kill him.<br/><br/>One of the shop's regular customers is Robert Loggia who likes Getty and embraces him and pinches his cheeks with a warmth only a Mafia capo could muster.<br/><br/>And here the story gets a little twisted, as if it weren't twisted enough. Loggia has a sexy girl friend, Patricia Arquette in a long blond wig, and the two of them get it on behind Loggia's back. Loggia traps the two of them in a run-down desert shack. Then -- I THINK this is what happens -- Pullman and Arquette make love outside but it's love interruptus when Loggia prepares to kill them. Arquette walks naked into the shack and morphs into the supernatural Robert Blake figure, who shoots Loggia full of holes. Pullman get into the car and drives off at high speed. A moment later, he appears to have another terrific headache, as if he's about to morph again, and then -- The End.<br/><br/>I take it that Loggia had Pullman's wife killed and framed Pullman for the job. Blake is the spirit of justice who sees that Hammurabi's code is properly followed. As the wanton blond, Arquette was only Blake in disguise. Getty is an innocent bystander pulled into the story merely to pin Loggia to the board like a butterfly. Loggia is the only guy who is exactly what he seems, an expansive murdering thug.<br/><br/>If you call me on that interpretation, I'll fold and you'll get only a small pot. I anted nothing.<br/><br/>It may be a lesser effort by Lynch but there's nothing quite like it around. Nobody, except the Coen brothers, are making such idiosyncratic movies. The music is as jumbled as the plot. Source music includes cowboy songs and whatnot. The overscore ranges from bossa nova by Antonio Carlos Jobim to something called "Rammstein" sung or chanted in basso profundo German. The interior sets are sparse, almost barren, and the color of internal organs. Women wear excessive makeup. Daytime outdoor scenes are few and there is, lamentably, no sense of "place," usually one of Lynch's strong points. We know some scenes take place in the desert but mostly because we hear of it. There are few glimpses of Death Valley, and all at twilight.<br/><br/>It seems incomplete, mystic, mystifying. But, again, it demonstrates a vision that is anything but commercial and deserves applause if only for that. Lynch takes the viewer again on a wild ride in his dark bizarre world of mystery. Rather than casting actors with whom his films are usually associated, he brings together a fresh cast that includes Bill Pullman, Patricia Arquette, Balthazar Getty and Robert Loggia. Yet, 'Lost Highway' has that surreal feel of fear and suspense that one associates with most of Lynch's films and the story presents themes such sex, murder, desire, obsession, jealousy, betrayal and doom which have been a key part of the director's other movies. This time he includes themes like pornography, prostitution and infidelity as part of the story. The treatment and style of execution is also similar to his other works, especially the use of light, colour, music, editing and cinematography, all of which are fabulously done. 'Lost Highway' is full of surprises. It is a complex puzzle but at the same time their are hints which may not be apparent at first sight but they do show the viewer which direction to follow in order to find the answer. The actors do a superb job. Pullman is cast in a different light and he proves that he can do more challenging roles. Renee and Alice seem to have been written for Patricia Arquette because she completely owns the part. Getty is just right for Pete and Loggia is brilliant. In 'Lost Highway' Lynch has used his usual ingredients to tell a new exciting story and involving the viewer in his dark world . I've just finished watching Lost Highway and it's almost like I have no idea what hit me. This film has some of the creepiest moments I've ever seen on film. Granted, I wouldn't say it's as creepy as Eraserhead but it still gave me the same feeling. David Lynch is truly a master of film making and though his films are hard to follow and no one ever really understands the meaning, it's a lot of fun to try to figure out what it means for myself and come to my own conclusions. This movie requires the viewer to do that.<br/><br/>The cast is great and perfect for the film. There are awesome performances from Bill Pullman, Balthazar Getty, Patricia Arquette, Robert Blake and even a couple funny cameos from Henry Rollins and Richard Pryor. The story is hard to follow and confusing like most David Lynch films. I've found that with Lynch's work, the best thing to do is just sit back, try not to think so hard and enjoy. You can try to figure out what it all means afterward.<br/><br/>Fans of Lynch will no doubt enjoy this film. Just prepare to be creeped out and confused! Lost Highway is my 2nd favourite David Lynch film. Unlike Eraserhead, which before also puzzled audiences, Lost Highway has a ratio of meaning that is just right. It desires to be analyzed. It is also his most frightening film. It is perhaps a film that you do not want to invite into your living room. My strategy to describe this movie is as before, to decide first of all what is real, and then what is not real. Lynch told audiences that this movie is about the OJ Simpson case. He was puzzled with the notion that a person can walk away from a crime, seemingly capable of forgetting that he did it. <br/><br/>The way I see it, the central character in Lost Highway has a split identity, triggered by murdering his girlfriend. As a grown up this character has the identity Fred Madison (someone who likes to remember things his own way, not necessarily how it happened), a saxophone player, played by Bill Pullman. Fred murders his girlfriend Renee Madison, played by Patricia Arquette, and ends up in jail. (But, for all that you know he was already in jail, for murdering her the first time. I don't know.) The 24 year old younger Fred is Peter Dayton, a mechanic, played by Balthazar Getty. Pete falls in love with one of the shop's main customer's (Mister Eddy, also known as Dick Laurent) girlfriend. The girlfriend is Alice, again played by Patricia Arquette. Mister Eddy is smooth as 'sh*t from a duck's ass' and on the wrong side of the law, with an abhorrence of tailgating. He and Andy are making porn/snuff films, with Alice as one of the actresses. My assumption is that Pete ends up killing Alice. <br/><br/>The truth grid of the story is thus the following: The main character, Pete Dayton, kills his girl friend because he can never fully have her, and keeps re imagining himself and her in fragments of the truth. He keeps re inventing the situation. Everything that does not stick to the grid is fabrications of Pete in his attempt to forget and re invent, and part of the process Lynch follows. <br/><br/>I'm going to highlight some important aspects of the film. Pete gets very likely jealous of Alice at one point. She asks him "Do you still want me Pete?" and tells him then "But, you can never have me". One never actually sees Pete murder Alice. My point is that what is happening, is kind off similar to what we have in Solaris. The beloved personality returns. No matter how many times Pete/Fred murders her, she always returns. In his mind, she might appear like twin sisters in a portrait. She doubles up like Dolly. If this movie would have continued, it could have opened with another manifestation of Fred, now middle age, and Patricia Arquette returning as his fixation. It is the obsession of a man that can never 'have her'. Fred meets a freaky looking mystery man played by Robert Blake at a party of Renee. The mystery man told Fred that they have met before, at Fred's house, and that he was invited into Fred's house by Fred himself, "It is not my custom to go where I am not invited". This is likely because Fred has murdered before, as the younger man, Pete. However, the mystery man said the same thing to Pete "We have met before, haven't we". We all know Lynch use mantra like phrases that reappear thru out his films. But I think this could reflect on the relativity theory and on the nature of time; on the configuration of Lost Highway, and likely of evil in itself. Pete invites evil into his house when he ends up murdering Alice, with the result that he is also then introduced to it at an earlier stage, to 'back up' the present. That is why he has met the mystery man before he even murdered Alice. The past is altered, and his parents, having watched parts of it, are 'lost for words'. It is kind off interesting that Fred decides to leave himself a message on his house intercom "Dick Laurent is dead". I think the mystery man whispered that in his ear, after Mister Eddy is killed. Linearly that is a tough part to explain, because the cops show up at that point. It might just fall thru the truth grid. It could be fabrication.<br/><br/>I'd like to add some references to Transendental Meditation (a process Lynch follows) here. The mantra needs to be repeated as easily as thoughts; as easily as thoughts manifest in your mind. It needs to float thru one's mind as effortlessly as clouds. I like to think here of the density of Patricia Arquette's words. Her voice has an ethereal quality. It must have appeared to Pete like utter magic on the phone. (Floating like smoke thru the holes in the receiver) It must have been an invitation that was inescapable. "Meet me at the Starlight Hotel at Sycamore, in 20 minutes" But her tease proved to be ultimately too much for him. "Miaaw miaaw. It's me. I can't see you tonight" <br/><br/>The film has spectacular moments. One of them is when Mister Eddy had Alice at his house the first time. This is one of my all time favourite scenes. Marilyn Manson's "I've put a spell on you" in the background. A fire blazing in the fireplace and Alice in her black underwear, sensually, and uncertainly awaiting Mister Eddy's orders. Mister Eddy's small nod for Alice, to approach him. The gun against her head. And, Pete asking her, "So, why didn't you just leave? You've must have liked it". I missed the opening minutes of this film and it's late at night, but it held my interest through till the end and left me thinking...<br/><br/>To me, it seemed a collage of strongly dramatic sequences, closely matching or harmonizing in tone, dynamics and texture, so as to present an overall sense of unity and aesthetic balance of composition. It reminds me of the Arnold Schoenberg approach to music, i.e., the creation of 'music' through pure application of structurally determined music theory (as in a computer simulation) - as opposed to the slower, traditional, "analog" methods involving individual inspiration and creativity. At the same time, it reminded me of "What's Up Tiger Lily" - a work I find unwatchable, but which is also a "collage", though a collage of music, voice and script elements over a thespian backdrop which is cinematically third-rate - i.e., Allen might as well have selected his characters from an anthill. What's more, the tone, texture, pseudo-logic, dramatic impetus of the elements in WUTL all seem to me too mediocre to endure - like a bad joke that doesn't know when to end - NONE of which is the case with Lost Highway, which is visually and dramatically gripping. And of course the title, itself, is revealing and subject to multiple interpretation.<br/><br/>I felt I was experiencing this film on various levels, one of which was of course the beautifully filmed and tense "tenor" of the story, but at the same time, I was witnessing the great sense of humor behind it all. <br/><br/>A aesthetic, well-constructed work; as said - at least an 8. You can understand nothing and make comment about everything at the same time after watching this movie.Moreover you don't need to watch to make comments on it.From this point of view it is amazing movie.So You won't lose approximately 2 hours for understanding the Lost Highway. It is like making a film by yourself.Everything is reasonable about your comments no matter what you think and what you say.I want to compliment Lynch, this movie will be enough for you about the cinema.Just watch it and never watch any other. I should write 10 lines to submit my comments.I can write more than 10000 lines which are irrelevant just like Lost Highway.You can not relate two things in the film, every point is a movie by itself. Again, just watch it and never watch any other...<br/><br/>(11 out of 10) Lost Highway is one of my most favourite movies.<br/><br/>The story is about Fred Madison (Bill Pullman) who plays the saxophone. He lives with his wife Renee (Patricia Arquette). One day he starts receiving some anonymous video tapes. Strange things happen after that and as in most of my reviews, I won't give away anything beyond this! This is another abstract movie, in which pieces are presented to the viewer and he/she is supposed to put them together! When you finally put it all together, you realize there might be alternate angles to the story! And indeed there are: and all theories seem to hold enough water to qualify as valid explanations to the movie! That is the magic of Lost Highway. <br/><br/>This is a highly misunderstood piece of art and for a good reason; it's just not everyone's cup of tea! There are some great performances here. Special mention of the supporting cast, i.e. Robert Loggia and Robert Blake.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is excellent as well. The score complements most of the scenes beautifully! <br/><br/>Watch it at least once, before you die! And I am sure you would want to watch it over and over again.... Ignore the rating and read on; to reduce thoughts on a film to mere mathematical weighting is inconsistent and unfair...<br/><br/>In the early days of narrative cinema, there was a problem with even the most simple of edits: the cut away, wherein one shot is replaced with another shot, which at first appears to be unrelated. It is only in the context of this transition that these separate shots form a meaning intelligible to the audience. In Lost Highway, however, precisely the opposite is true. When, a third into the movie, Fred Madison transforms into an entirely different character Pete Dayton, it confuses the viewer. Proceedings are given even more complexity when Pete, our new protagonist in the narrative's discourse, meets Alice Wakefield, played by the same actress as Fred's wife Renee, Patricia Arquette. When the cops, who have just released an innocent Pete from jail, reveal that his gangster associate Mr. Eddie is in fact Dick Laurent, things become even more confusing. And when, by the end of the film, Pete has transformed back to Fred, and Mr. Eddie into Dick Laurent (not to mention an appearance by Andy in both parallel narratives), viewers could well be throwing in the towel.<br/><br/>This is, then, no conventional work. Lynch employs Brechtian techniques in a meandering plot which deals, essentially, with questions of identity and character crises. When trying to justify the over-elaborate, dense narrative of his Mulholland Dr. (2001) on the Region 2 DVD, Lynch hints that questions of identity are part of everyday life, and we all have to deal with it. This contemporary noir, with its convoluted character-switching and circular narrative, may be taken as a film which labours a point which could easily be dealt with in less tortuous circumstances. But there is a fitting quote from one of Lynch's influences, to counter this point, and the director may even have paraphrased it himself at one point or another. "In order to convey fact, you can only ever so do through distortion," so painter Francis Bacon was announced. Here, in Lost Highway, the distortion becomes, oddly, the only way to get Lynch's message across.<br/><br/>Told, as ever, as a brooding Lynchian nightmare, with Peter Deming's camera accentuating the alarming reds and stark Baconesque yellows and pinks of the characters' spacious, minimalist apartments, Highway starts as a conventional film noir before turning into a disturbing, often frightening mystery, slowly unfolding itself into an even deeper, denser world of mistrust and suspicion. The opening third, in which Fred and wife Renee receive a series of mysterious videos of footage of themselves sleeping in their bedroom, comprises a succession of short, disjointed scenes made all the more strained by the editing: a slow train of fade to blacks, as if to suggest falling in and out of consciousness, dreaminess, a state of nightmare. Lynch's camera lingers on the dark corners of rooms, wanting, but scared to, explore them further. In contrast, the part in the film dealing with Pete's decline into lustful desire for mistress Alice is more wordy and, to perhaps seem as far away from Fred's opening character arc as possible, told with more purpose.<br/><br/>That Fred and Pete are the same characters has widely been argued, and to valid extent. But what if we, as an audience by now used almost too used to the language of film, and immune to its potential to create new, innovative sparks in its mechanics, are taking it for granted that, as the same characters crop up in each of the film's parallel narratives, they must belong in the same world? What if, when we cut away to Pete's story, we have been taken to a whole new world which only looks the same as that in which Fred was jailed? Looking at the film in this way, taking one world as some kind of reality and the other as a dream, each separate story, even when morphing into one, as it seems to do in the latter stages, can now be enjoyed for what it is. Or indeed, the two narratives could well be two cogs on the same wheel, and the film itself is, in true Lynch fashion, an inescapable nightmare for all, with characters taking on the names of others. Or rather, this is a kaleidoscopic precursor for Cronenberg's A History of Violence (2005), a film which deals with masculine wish-fulfilment to transform into an alter-ego in order to cope with the boredom of life. Here we have the predominant characters all with their own alter egos; Fred and Pete, Renee and Alice, Mr. Eddie and Dick Laurent, and, it could even be argued, the Mystery Man and Andy.<br/><br/>From whose point, then, is this nightmare told? An obvious answer would be Fred's. It has been debated that the second half of the film is merely Fred convincing himself, through an extended fantasy in which he is Pete Dayton, of his own innocence in his wife's murder. But the film could equally be regarded as from Pete's point of view, with Fred the fictional character. But to ask these questions is to not necessarily seek an answer; indeed, when watching Lost Highway, you get the feeling that Lynch is simply exploring ideas here: masculine doubt (both Fred and Pete have problems finishing during sex), identity crises and, to study the haunting surface level of the film, nightmares and their connection to memory and the unconscious. Although not as confusing as "Eraserhead" and "Muholland Drive", "Lost Highway" still manages to screw with your mind and make your head spin while trying to figure the film out. Of course like most of Lynch's work, "Lost Highway" has lots and lots of sex and violence. At times the material is such a hard R rating that it feels almost NC-17. It's like David Lych has taken someone's nightmare and filmed it. Bill Pullman plays Fred, a saxophone player who is constantly being stocked by the creepy Robert Blake. He receives a strange box on his porch, the box contains a video with footage of him and his wife (Rosanna Arquette) sleeping. The mysterious character (Blake) claims to know him. Ironically Fred's wife is murdered. (and no it wasn't Blake who did it)(well in the movie at least). All kidding aside, Fred is accused of the murder and put on death row. He has a blackout and wakes up as a completely different person, Peter. Peter is a young twenty something mechanic who has ties with the mob. In the film, the two characters morph back and forth into either Fred or Pete. Either way both guys are wanted by the law. So I felt that basically this guy is trapped in a parallel, switching back and forth into each body. It's like he's stuck on an endless highway, a hell that keeps going full force into nowhere. This is just my perspective. I could be way off. Oh hell, who am I kidding? I'll have to watch this film 3 more times. See what films like this do. They make me think too much. But sometimes thinking can be a lot of fun! Not for everyone, but I found "Lost Highway" to be an absolutely stunning movie. The camera work, the lightning, the soundtrack and the acting all blend together to perfection, telling a story about a man on the verge of a nervous breakdown, or is it? Fred Madison, a saxophonist, is accused under mysterious circumstances of murdering his wife Renee. On death row, he inexplicably morphs into a young man named Pete Dayton. Yes,the story IS complicated and it DOES NOT give straight answers. If that is something you don't like, then "Lost Highway" is simply not for you. You will miss a really good movie though (in my opinion much better than "Mulholland Drive"). David Lynch once again takes us on a ride "beyond, beyond, beyond". My rating: 8/10 David Lynch's philosophy has always been art over entertainment, and this film continues that trend. However this is Lynch's most entertaining film to date, despite the slow start and annoyingly whispered dialogue.<br/><br/>This odd film centers around a jazz saxophonist(Pullman) who is convicted of murdering his wife(Arquette). While in prison, he transforms into a twenty four year old mechanic wiz(Getty), but that little plot line never gets fully explained.<br/><br/>This film will leave many viewers scratching their heads, which is always Lynch's intent, but if you can't follow the plot, just enjoy the soundtrack, which features Rammstein and Nine Inch Nails, and Patricia Arquette showing off her flawless form often.<br/><br/>Finally something decent by David Lynch. This film simultaneously pays homage to and reshapes the film noir 'genre' into a turn of the century neo-noir that only David Lynch could make.<br/><br/>The opening half of the film is slow, difficult at times to follow and understand, yet is central to the second half of the film where films make as much sense as one could want in a film from this director. It is almost as if the first half becomes a 'b-film', played before the main spectacle (many film noirs from the defining period of the 1940s and 1950s were featured as such - deliberately low-budget). Lynch's 'main-spectacle' begins when car-mechanic Pete seems to metamorphise into Fred, a convicted murder in a death-row cell. The innocence youth Pete is released upon identity, and Lynch from then on in abounds in tributes to classic film noir imagery, such as a burning beach house, high speed west coast car chases, and a chilling camera shot that makes the viewer think the mechanic will get crushed by the car he is operating under, as poor Nick perished in 'Kiss Me Deadly'.<br/><br/>However, the two noir motifs that blend the 'b-film' and 'the main spectacle' are the 'femme fatale', played by the same actress (a striking brunette, and a deadly blonde. Perhaps their character's relationship to the plot makes more sense in light of Mulholland Drive's lesbian sex scene?), and the obese and incompetent detectives. The development of these characters through the two 'films' within a film binds the narrative together whilst leaving several threads of the plot open to question. The most valid interpretation is as the director himself as said, in life there are no answers, so why should his films have answers? Like all noir films, that were not made under Hollywood's strict codes of production, Lynch challenges the 'safe' world of classical Hollywood cinema, in which questions are answered and film making rules obeyed. For this reason, if one can categorise Lynch, he is a director of noir films. A rebel who questions both filmmaking and becomes a modern philosopher.<br/><br/>Lynch's genius is that he at once acknowledges the importance and ambiguity of the noir 'genre' (in film criticism it is highly debatable whether noir is even a genre in its own right, or not a hybrid of the gangster or detective), yet challenges its boundaries, presenting a 'b-movie' as both a prelude yet also an integral part of his main feature. Lost Highway takes an already ambiguous 'genre', and creates a movie that breaks even its' 'genre's codes of production. The house doesn't burn. The mechanic isn't crushed. Who the hell is the mystery man?! Lynch's ambiguities elevate the mystery surrounding Kiss Me Deadly's 'Great Whatsit' to extended hyperbole, that extends the noir 'genre' boundaries to the point where the genre is 'noir', it is 'Lynch'.<br/><br/>This film should be looked at as a challenge to criticism surrounding the noir 'genre' and is a central part of Lynch's filmography. It should be watched after seeing 'Kiss Me Deadly' and after being acquainted with Lynch's other films. possible spoilers? - Dick Laurent is dead. this is the message fred gets through his intercom at the beginning. the joke is we only get to realize that it was Fred that killed Dick at the end of the picture...<br/><br/>everything in this film is a reflection of the inner workings of a deranged (song title) wife killer's mind. When questioned why he hates videocameras, Fred says: 'I like to remember things my own way, not necessarily the way they happened...' This is Lynch's mantra. Forget conventional storytelling. it's boring, anyway you learn so little from it. the story here is what's inside this man's deranged head, not how things necessarily happened - what you get is a fascinating journey through a clearly sychizoid mind (fred plus that other fantasy guy pete, he wishes he could escape to, but can't). Fun aside (and Lynch lets loose at every occasion; mr.eddy's phone call to check if Pete's 'alright' is priceless...), you might think it's all a bit pointless. True, it doesn't exactly have the pathos of 'Mullholland Drive', and yet it is entirely more fascinating in style and direction - if that matters, is up to you. i prefer Lost Highway. haven't had so much fun watching a film since Bunuel's masterpeice 'Exterminating Angel'. This is a film that very few people seem to agree on. I think it is one of the better films that David Lynch has done. It is ahead of its time, and highly unique, even though it pays homage to many film noirs before it. Highly Recommended. Magnifique. After I first finished watching this film I simply sat back in amazement as the credits rolled.  I had never seen anything quite like this, I had hoped for something good from the latest David Lynch film but I had never expected this, in my mind I could only think of one thing: "This is the best film I have ever seen!"  Okay so maybe it isn't the best but it's at least number 2. This film has an amazing feel to it that simply keeps you glued to the screen with eyes wide open.  Lost Highway isn't the sort of film you can really explain, or even understand, and I don't think we're supposed to, this is a film that you feel, and it feels good! Tell you what. Watching David Lynch's Lost Highway is like getting a new sex toy. At first you just sit there scratching your head, trying to make head or tail of it, but once you figure it out it'll give you immense pleasure. I discovered Bill Pullman about a year ago while watching an older movie, and I've been trying to find and watch all his movies ever since. I saw L.H. on the shelf every time I went to the video store, but I read so many negative comments about it that I kept passing it. Those comments were interesting though. I was surprised to find that the number of people who thought it was a piece of art was pretty much the same as the ones who thought it was a piece of crap. So at the end I got tired of the bickering and decided to see it for myself. So I took it home and watched it. After about 10 lines of dialogue I sighed and thought:"Gosh, it's gonna be a long movie!" Well, it sure was. At the end I sat there wondering what the heck I've just seen. It didn't make a lot of sense to me, seemed like a mess, scenes thrown together for no apparent reason, etc. Lots of nudity, silly, dragging dialogue, a creepy man with a monkey face... I thought it was either a terrible movie, or I'm a mental midget, or maybe I missed something. And guess what? The latter proved to be the right answer. I went searching for a David Lynch site and I found an interview with the director, in which he described his movie as a "psychotic fugue". When I read that I felt like someone just turned the lights on. It all started making sense now, I even understood Pullman's reference to the O.J. case. So I watched the film with renewed interest and I found that I actually enjoyed it. Finally, the previously incomprehensible scenes had a meaning. I can't claim I have the whole thing figured out, but it sure got me thinking. The key is to try not to look at it as a movie, but more like a painting. First it might seem like one of those abstract things that look like a monkey dipped its fingers into paint and smeared it all over the canvas, but the more you look at it the more sense it's gonna make. So I suggest you guys just take the time to observe it before you decide it's crap, because you might get surprised just like I did. I found I didn't feel like taking the tape back at the end.It's been 6 weeks now since I saw it and I still keep trying to figure out the whole thing. Some people managed to find all the pieces of the puzzle, I read some pretty impressive, detailed reviews on other sites. All in all, once I "got it" I really enjoyed this movie, and I think I'll keep putting the pieces together for a long, long time. The scenes with Bill Pullman in the lead are quite simply, creepy as hell. These scenes are for me the best the film has to offer. The rest is okay and you have got to love the rest of the cast, especially Robert Loggia. What'd they do to get him to scream at the tailgater like that? Last time I screamed at someone like that, it was at my four-year old niece for leaving her jacks set on the floor, which I unfortunately stepped on barefoot. This movie will warp your mind and I suggest you watch it for what is lain before you. Trying to put this movie together will rack your brain and give you a headache. The film equivalent of the question, "Does God exist?" You'll have an idea but chances are you'll leave out one minor detail that'll tear your concept down. My head hurts now, just thinking about it. Watch it in the dark with whoever you're sleeping with. Rating: **** out of ***** When I entered the cinema to see this film I followed the plastic highway placed on the floor and knew I was in for a treat. This films beauty is in its soundtrack, imagery and dream like mind state. It will be hard for people who like a more formulatic approach to movies, but wonderful for people whose mindset is not rigidly stuck to the usual formulas for film.<br/><br/>This film is utterly entertaining and fascinating, and is worth watching again and again for the effect it has on you. I watch this when I want to be taken away into an uncontrollable dream like state where I am thoroughly captivated by the films mood.<br/><br/>For those of you who post the one star reviews (notice there is mainly 5 or 1 star reviews?) please go back to Titanic or something that will not challenge you too much. A true lesson in original film making. I happen to be a big fan of Twin Peaks, but not a big fan of most of Lynch's movies. When I first saw Lost Highway I didn't really like it. I hadn't read anything about it up to that point so I had had a hard time following it. However, I started discussing the film with a fellow "Buff" and he helped me look at the film in a new way. I decided to read up on the film and I found a quote that Lynch had said about the film, he had mentioned the mental illness "psychogenic fugue", a disease where you create a new identity and completely forget your past identity. Also, the term "fugue" used in music is for when a song starts off in one direction and then moves completely in another direction and then finally shifts back to where it started. With that in mind I watched the movie again and made sense. I started noticing a lot of beautiful visuals that I hadn't noticed before. By the time it was done, it seemed like I had seen a completely new movie. I still had a hard time getting over some of the gratuitous sex and violence but it seemed to actually fit. I'd like to end by saying that I watched other Lynch films and had better appreciation for them, well except for Dune. Folks, I think I've got an answer. Who was it up there that said something about this being a lesson of sorts in male insecurities? I think there's something to that. Consider: Fred Maddison is obviously bad in bed--the one scene with Renee is in extreme slow motion. Seeing's how I'm short on time, we'll leave that alone.<br/><br/>I just want to tell everyone out there that this film is entirely decipherable. It's a puzzle box, but a deeply rewarding one. Because once you see it, you realize this truly is a wonderful mood piece. It goes not for explanation, which would detract a great deal from the emotional core of the movie, but for expression. The music is an A+ effort, and so is the character of the Mystery Man. Lost Highway is a nice blend of hateful spices, and if you ever do figure out everything about it...forget it. Unlearn it. Look at it as a possibly routine, drab, everyday subject turned magnificent. Because what are we left with? We're left with angst. We're left exposed to our aggressions. We're left feeling the urge to find our own Dick Laurent, who spoiled our innocent women. Strange movie that doesn't seem to be about much, but yet it's totally absorbing.  The cinematography is good, lots of shadows and strange lights cast on things create a sinister look. The soundtrack is equally creepy and sinister.  There's not much dialogue in the film and the plot is deliberately confusing, often contradicting itself.  Ultimately, and unfortunately the resolution of the plot is unsatisfying however.  The film is worth a look however as it's a change from the norm.  <br/><br/>7/10 ***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS**** Lost Highway is definitely David Lynch's most obscure film, but in making it so obscure he has remained completely true to what he was trying to do. He's giving us a completely subjective viewpoint of a man who is insane, and how can anyone argue that he's doing it wrong?  What throws people off about this film is that it is so subjective it can be misinterpreted as a pointless exercise in weirdness.<br/><br/>Subjective films are nothing new.  Requiem for a Dream was a subjective film.  However, Aronofsky is showing us these things as an outsider might view them, and ends with an outsider's perspective.  When Sara Goldfarb wanders out of her house toward the end and ends up in the television station, we see the reactions of others and can therefore accurately judge the reality of the situation.  Lynch does this a little during the first third of the film, for instance, when Fred is talking to the detectives or talking with Andy after first meeting the Man in Black, but as the film progresses, the viewpoint becomes more and more internalized.  The film doesn't make much rational sense, but then again, insane people don't behave very rationally.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT!!!!!<br/><br/>In the final third of the film, when Pete turns back to Fred, obviously because his fantasy has left him as dejected as he was in real life, he has no choice but to face up to what he has done.  The cabin exploding in reverse is Fred's psyche, which is shattered, coming back together in the guise of Pete.  As mentioned earlier, Pete fails.  After this, he mentally retraces the steps of his earlier murder of Dick Laurent, which happened before the film even starts.  He followed Dick and Renee to a hotel, waited for Renee to leave, put Dick in his trunk, went out to the desert, and killed him.  He then comes back to his house and says as much.  Of course, this is all in Fred's head, and he still can't come to grips with what happened, so everything loops back on itself.<br/><br/>END SPOILER<br/><br/>Anyway, I don't like to verbalize what happens in David Lynch films because a lot of the magic is lost in the translation.  It's like translating a foreign language to English.  The meaning is still there, but it loses something, its flow, its fluidity, its beauty.  I just wanted to explain that because I'm sick of people complaining that the film is pretentious nonsense.  It's not at all.  It just operates completely within the language of film, and most people don't know how to read it. Lynch really takes the to the road. He knows it all the way as deep as knowing goes.A sound scape of equal value. An all pervading medium of light, of color, of sound that fuse and separate and engulf whole carloads of matter, rudimentary and deadly. I have to say that "Lost Highway" is a true masterpiece. It's exciting, surprising, mystical, thrilling, weird - everything that a really great movie has to offer. Bill Pullman does a great job. And of course Patricia Arquette - she plays so many different characters and she's fantastic. I really love this movie! David Lynch made a one of a kind film, where nobody able to make some real sense of it. In fact you can come up with different theories or senses about this film, but there's always at least one tiny piece in the puzzle that won't fit at all. SPOILER ALERT There is a time-loop in it (Fred Madison answers a door bell and is ringing it himself at the end of the film - even the background sounds are in time), a complete change of the main charachter and his personality (Fred  into Pete) and a whole lot of other stuff to disprove any possible theory. One would make up any theory and its still this tiny little scene that makes another say: "but what about this particular scene?"  - And that's the films point: it hasn't got any sense! Accept it! As you watch the short "behind the scene"-Feature of the DVD, you can see that even the actors didn't have a clue themselves. I think it's very hard to do that kind of a film, so I rate it 5 out of 5. After watching the movie, I can't quite grasp how I feel about it.  This is most likely due to the fact that I am not 100% certain that my idea about what happened is correct.  But then, maybe it's one of the rare movies that actually <gasp> wants you to make up your own meaning.  Well, even so, I still can't decide if I liked it or not.  At times it was fascinating, at others I was bored.  If you are a fan of Lynch, you will no doubt appreciate this.  If you don't like Lynch, you should certainly not watch this.  If you don't know Lynch and you like to view styles that you don't see in mainstream movies, give it a try.  I can't promise that you will like it, but it is definitely an experience. What an excellent film!. The first 45 min. of the movie are the best ones I´ve ever seen in History. The cast is excellent. The dark photography, the wonderful soundtrack, the strange story, plenty of hidden secrets... everything is perfect! When I saw the film, I went out the theatre completely stunned. Mr. Lynch, you are great... The truth about this film, one of Lynch's finest, is not complicated. It is a story about the passion for a woman, both a demoness and a goddess, wonderfully played by Arquette, sadly undervalued in her time. The pure desire and madness inspired by women like her is the focus of the film. Simple and complex in the same moment, and Lynch is able to capture the sensation perfectly. Truly amazing, I must say. Arquette is absolutely spectacular, and Pullman and Loggia carry the film during the moments where she is absent. Art in its purest form is not meant to be understood, it is meant to be analyzed. Hats off. What a bizarre, disorienting movie. It feels similar to Mulholland Drive but in a cold, detached sorta way. It's feels very distant which makes sense considering how distant all the characters are. Everyone is one note but it seems intentional, even though I'm not sure how well it works. All the performances are like this. Cold and monotone. It makes it a little difficult to connect to anyone or anything. There's sparks of that typical Lynch humor, but it's more or less gone here. For the most part the film is quite dark and serious. Without the typical Lynch humor some of the more serious stuff doesn't quite land. It's a hard movie to describe due to this unique tone and presentation. This may be the only David Lynch movie I've seen where I didn't like anybody, nor was I invested in the story. There's a clear rhythm to it all but the constant changing characters and surreal imagery just doesn't play here for some reason. Somehow it comes off overly convoluted. Again, it's hard to explain, but it just didn't click for me. Looks great though This film has some dreamlike and atmospheric moments that are the best part of the film. unfortunately, at a certain point the film loses steam and my interest dwindles. Acting is solid and the above mentioned movements elevate the film when they happen (The Robert Blake sequence is creepy in hindsight especially) but the story is not very engaging and can't keep me invested through its runtime. Like a dream, Lost Highway has as many plots as it does viewers with their own individual interpretations and perspectives. It forces itself upon you with a vengeance, but simultaneously encourages the kind of disengagement you experience when you are conscious that you are dreaming.<br/><br/>Technically, for me this film is super interesting as I study film history and media theory and this film has so many hidden theorems, techniques and thought-landscapes woven into it.
It does not even depend on wether one 'liked or not liked' the film, but the many different tricks this film play on the audience (hence some of the 'I don't like it!' attitude - who likes being tricked, guided and played with?). Lynch loses the conventional logic in this one, as well as continuous time and space connections; he displays scenes as dreams and as reality without explaining which is which - he is super unconventional in the way he tells the story: view it the first time and you won't get many scenes (such as memories, jump-backs, dreams,...). You get confused by the Doppelgängers (or something like that!). You get promised a story about Fred, but end up with another character. So many things that are used well-selected and (surely) mostly intentional.<br/><br/>I find also some visual elements very interesting, such as very silent, long shots (where actors come or leave the frame and the camera keeps shooting 1-2 uncomfortable seconds the empty room). Characters feel like ghosts due to their empty gazes, slow movements and often being shot in a weird angle (or half hidden behind something else). The light situations change subtly in an unnatural way from shot to shot (the usual viewer won't recognize it, but subconsciously it DOES something to them!). The rooms are most likely shot straight on with a parallel wall behind, enclosing the scene, making it feel sometimes claustrophobic. In some sets (like Freds home) the walls are uncomfortably empty, like a theatre stage (also mind the red curtain in front of the windows.. another reality outside that building?). Lynch plays harshly against the viewing 'habit' of the audience that is used to continuous story-telling (with logic!) and a story where all mysteries will be dissolved by the narration itself. He breaks 'all' the rules and creates his own, surreal universe. One that makes the viewer think and explore instead of just receiving images - we start projecting, thinking, dreaming, imagining on our own. That is, for me, the true magic of Lynch.<br/><br/>It is not so much about the interpretation (which, I am sure, there are TONS of 'this means this, this means that,...') but the fact that you have to guess it on your own, if you like it - OR NOT!<br/><br/>What you make of it is your thing - go watch it with some friends you can discuss it after. Expect this to go on even days, weeks, years after you watched the film the first time - and hold on! You might have to watch it 1,2,3,4, ... times to dive deeper into the universe of this film.<br/><br/>Watch it on a big screen and don't look at your phone in the meantime - get sucked in, it becomes an experience. Get sucked in! It's time to put that thinking cap back on, and use your noggen, for yet another Lynch pic, and his most complex. This is a Lynch film I like a lot, the rocking opening music score, a mini entree, for what follows, demands heavy concentration. This is Lynch all over again, weird moments and unforgettably dark and funny images. Sax player Fred (Bill Pullman) is framed for murder, and sent to jail. He comes out, only he's another person in the film, Pete. What happened in between? A big problem is to be solved here. Fred's wife, Alice (Patricia Arquette) was seeing Pete, while also being a mistress and star of porno flicks, for a bad arse Mr Eddy (Loggia at to peak). Arquette exudes so much sexuality, this is a talent to her acting, she's really good at, after whetting our whistles in True Romance. When she strips in a flashback scene, when introduced to Mr Eddy, it's a really gratifying moment, as is the whole film is gratifying. Lost Highway is very dark, and vaque as in trying to master it's story. Robert Blake as a mystery man, exudes so much menace, he's one of the best things about this cinematic experience, while Richard Pryor in his last acting role, and very sick at the time with MS, has minimal viewing time, running a mechanic's garage, where Pete work, where for Pryor's presence, it's kind of degrading. Lost Highway ends too on the same highway, with the same music score, and the end credits rolling along, as we speed down it. This 97 Lynch is taken up a few more notches, as in it's trying to master plot. You really have to think about, if more so don't, and just enjoy it, especially Lynch fans. In a world full of hollywood blockbusters that cram their ideals into your minds, David Lynch tells a tale that is completely open to suggestion.<br/><br/>Here is my interpretation:<br/><br/>A saxaphone player named Fred begins to doubt his marriage. He begins to believe that his wife is cheating on him and that she is not the same woman that he married. The "mystery man" that he meets at the party tells him the he "invited" him into his house... and represents his newfound doubt and fear. He has invited doubt into his house. His once balanced life and mind is now full of doubt and is therefore a "lost highway" which only takes him further into the unknown... a.k.a More and more doubt. Once you begin to doubt yourself, there is no end to it.<br/><br/>The second half of the story is his delusion while he spend his time in prision. A young man that works for a mob boss and is tempted by desire who just happens to look exactly like his wife. Fred has convinced himself that there is more to it than simple adultery, and David Lynch shows us his newfound fantasy. How can his betrayal be as simple as that? The steamy love scenes between the young man and his wife is merely his desires to be with his wife again the way they were, unfortunately doubt once again gets into the way.<br/><br/>As for the reason why doubt sides with him in the end? Because Fred's fears were correct. His wife was cheating on him, but from then on he will never trust anyone fully again and is therefore stuck on the lost highway.<br/><br/>If you want an intellectual film, watch it. If having to think about a film is not you style, go rent the Fast and the Furious. "A world where time is dangerously out of control" and "A graphic investigation into parallel identity crises" are both quotes from David Lynch's Lost Highway Screenplay - I got this Screenplay from an un-official web-site, so I assume that this can be credited to Mr. Lynch. I start this review with these quotes, as I feel they neatly sum up this perplexing film.<br/><br/>The great thing about Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive is that they are both films that engaged me, and left me with a riddle I felt I had to try and solve. This involved checking other IMDB reviews and the Internet for "clues" and solutions to the storylines. This is a rather futile exercise, as I do not think the answers are that simple, but it's rather endearing that movies can still have this effect within a culture that expects everything to be neatly wrapped up and explained.<br/><br/>I will not try to explain the plot, apart from that it seems to be two stories and characters that merge together at the end of the film, only to Moebius loop around to leave you where you started (how's that for a Lynchian explanation?).<br/><br/>I have read several reviews that ask you to "let the art of this film speak to you on an subconscious level/just enjoy the images" and not try to make too much sense of it. Now that's fine - but a little unfair to mainstream movie goers, who would (should?) get a storyline that at least make's sense after a little effort and thought from the audience. Lynch is well know for refusing to explain his work, and that should be his artistic right - so is he being deliberately antagonistic with this work, or does it all make sense and we are missing the message? Either way - it's got me thinking about the film and writing this review....<br/><br/>Personally, I find this the "weirdest" of all the Lynch films I have seen. But I like his work, and am pleased that art-house movie making is still taking place, and known directors like Lynch can bring this to a mainstream audience. Seeing something that is very personal and un-filtered by the Hollywood system is pretty rare these days - so we should applaud Lost Highway for this fact alone. David Lynch's "Lost Highway" is an astonishing acheivement that will blow you away.  It is a sexy, surrealistic, abstract film that has subtle humor, but is genuinely creepy, disturbing and haunting.<br/><br/>    Many complain it didn't make sense, but its David Lynch's art that maybe only he understands and they say you really shouldn't question art.  Trying to piece it together is not the point.<br/><br/>   There are Lynch trademarks galore, including the highway shot, a bizzare man the film is centered around, offbeat characters and humor, the theme of control and much more.<br/><br/>    There are great players for the film.  Patricia Arquette looks great as a woman who the main characters are focused on.  Bill Pullman/Belzhar Ghetty (as practically the same character) give quiet performances, but the brilliance is their ability to show their character's internal emotions. Robert Blake steals the show in a truly frightening performance.<br/><br/>    I loved every original minute of this film! Absolutely underrated.  This film is perhaps one of the best film noirs to emerge for quite a while.  Whilst it may not appeal to all tastes, it is pure cinematic genious.  I highly recommend it to anyone who likes a good film noir, a brilliant alternative soundtrack or just a good mystery.  A must-see for any David Lynch fan! In so many of David Lynch's movies it helps a lot to have studied the unique world of his films because Lynch has the most personal film vocabulary that I have come across. Without that background, Lost Highway will leave you just that, lost. You may wonder if maybe a murder has been committed in this movie but after about half way through, are you sure of anything?<br/><br/>One part of Lost Highway is about someone who suffers from a type of amnesia where a person completely forgets who he or she is. Now, Lynch never plays things straight and so there are events in the movie that go far beyond this basic idea but still remembering the amnesia premise makes some sense with the main character at least for a while. <br/><br/>Another part of the film is a return to a theme Lynch has explored many times but especially in Twin Peaks. It is the idea that underneath the real world is a supernatural world of evil. (Is it possible for Lynch to have positive supernatural forces? Only rarely.) This power comes into play in Lost Highway in the manipulation of people as if they are puppets. Our main character is transported and transformed in some strange horrible way. Also, the gangster in the movie played by Robert Loggia can be seen as a representation of evil. <br/><br/>Finally there are the dream images. At times Lynch will film something that is based on what he has dreamed. He likes that effect and for him such scenes are beyond explanation. While using dream images makes it hard to know what is going on, it is also a key to Lynch's success and the main reason that Lost Highway is so fascinating to watch. Lynch is masterful at creating filmed nightmares and they have a grotesque, hypnotic quality.<br/><br/>
The whole effect of the photography, music and acting creates an eerie off balance quality. Lost Highway spills out of the screen like ooze pulling you into another world which you think is real but after a while you may want to pinch yourself to wake up because you know this isn't Kansas, definitely not Hollywood and maybe not even earth. The film is a hypnotic nightmare come to life. A surrealistic celluloid masterpiece that left me spellbound. It's Lynch at his best with scenes that both provoke laughter and creep under your skin. That tailgating scene with Robert Loggia is a gas. I can't honestly say I "got" most of this movie but I don't think I was meant to. So I guess what I'm trying to say is although I may not have understood it,I loved it. Does that make sense? Just see the movie. This is a movie to be experienced. True, if you try to think of it logically, it makes little sense. But if you just absorb the movie and let its interior logic do its work, you'll find yourself entranced. It is a real atmospheric masterpiece, not to mention the great performance by Robert Blake. Who cares if Ebert didn't understand it, check it out. Lynch does good work. This is a wonderful movie. Typical Lynch. I spent the first 45 minutes in awe. The movie losts it`s way a little at the mid part, but came back at the end. Yes, this movie doesn't make sense if you look at it straight on. On a diet of fluff that Hollywood feed us, a movie like Lost Highway will seem like weirdness as there is nobody out there making movies with any brains anymore. I'm a Lynch fan and he is my favourite director. While Blue Velvet is undoubtedly his best movie, Lost Highway easily ranks next to my second favourite, Fire Walk With Me. (For the record, I hated Wild at Heart.) Subtle visual metaphors, wonderful direction, pacing that works to perfection... This movie is terrific.<br/><br/>This movie will of course be slaughtered by a lot of people, due to the fact that most people like their movies to be tied up in a nice little bundle at the end. Life is not like that, and neither is this movie. Sure, the movie leaves you with more questions than answers, but what questions! A film to challenge you, a film to confuse you, a film to shock you, but more importantly, a film to show you what REAL direction and film making are about. In any other directors hands this movie would have either been way shorter, or boring as hell. (For an horrendous movie which is also long, check out The Horse Whisperer. HORRIBLE!) While there are long periods of silence, camera shots that last way longer than they would ordinarily, it all adds up to a film which creates a creepy, disturbing atmosphere which just doesn't let up until the end.<br/><br/>One footnote about the movie, it was fantastic to see Richard Pryor after all these years.<br/><br/>Way to go Lynch. Never surrender to the corporate masses. All the time directors like you around, there is hope for the movie industry. You will survive and enjoy Lost Highway if you can accept early on that the plotline is not linear, nor does the plot itself make perfect sense. This is not to say Lost Highway wasn't well thought out or that it has plot holes. Big difference. Like most other Lynch films, it is abstractions, not actions, that provide the momentum, voice and context of the movie. The typically sparse dialogue is hypnotizing and the figure-8 story is really provocative as long as you let yourself get into the right frame of mind ... and you don't watch it with a bunch of dickheads. In making LOST HIGHWAY, David Lynch took a huge risk (as he does very often). Many say that there is no plot to this film, but the fact is that there is a very big plot. It deals with the documented mental condition Psychogenic Fugue - when a person invents a reality - or a world - in their mind complete with a full cast of characters and events, and lives a moment or period of time over and over and over again. Take this bit of information and do what you will with it.<br/><br/>A good reviewer though does not talk about the plot. He talks about hte film. The film is amazingly shot - it's beautiful. Lynch navigates the world he's created effortlessly. Bill Pullman is brilliant, Patricia Arquette is abnormally on the ball and Balthazar Getty blew me away. It also has a brilliant sound-design (created by Lynch).<br/><br/>While this is definitely not Lynch's best (Blue Velvet takes that title), it is definitely very good. It would probably be Number Four (behind BV, Elephant Man and Mulholland Drive) in a Lynch Top Five.<br/><br/>The film also is one of the most erotic movies I've ever seen - not even EYES WIDE SHUT could beat this one for the number of erotic moments.<br/><br/>David Lynch has created something truly special with Lost Highway, and even when it slows down and your inner film critic goes "No way! I don't believe it for a secodn!" you still DO believe it. And even if you don't like the film, you will still agree that it's better than 95 percent of most other Hollywood garbage that's put out each year. Don't listen to the critics with respect to "Lost Highway".  They lack vision and they lack understanding.  This movie is absolutely breathtaking, and it is Lynch at his most extraordinary and fearless.  It belongs in its own beautiful and awe inspiring way to both the horror genre and the film noir genre, not quite safely belonging under any category because of its aesthetic uniqueness, distinctive, indescribable mysteriousness and poetic fluidity. The luminous phantasmagoria and dream logic of the whole thing puzzles, but in an intriguing way--it is not frustrating but stimulating. You might venture to say that Lynch is trying to tell us something about the human condition as a whole (and in this he might be compared to Kafka or Gogol) by leaving what is traditionally thought of as 'the answers' in terms of plot out--why give the illusion of understanding and ultimate resolution when in reality we are completely in the dark about the purpose and meaning of our lives? This movie will immediately appeal to the attentive and imaginative viewer, because it can be interpreted in any number of ways and is not bound by the conventions of mediocre, ordinary cinema.  It is surrealism at its finest, and anyone with even the slightest taste for artistic probing of the unconscious mind will eat this film like candy. Lynch makes his masterful appeal above all to the human imagination, and implies in a thousand ways that it is in this faculty alone, our subjectivity and inner life, that we are to find even a shred of hope or happiness. ("I like to remember things my own way, not necessarily..") Needless to say, those who are infuriated (and why not admit it? this applies to the majority of people), by anything that requires thinking will find this movie repugnant.  For anyone with half a brain, buy it, pop it in and prepare to enjoy.  Pure, unfiltered film poetry in all its majesty. Now see, these are the types of movies I like to see. Once you reached the end of the film you didn't quite grasp the whole meaning, and you didn't quite understand it. So you have to keep watching it over and over to better understand it. Looking for small clues to completely "get it." That's why these types of movies are so much fun to watch. No matter how many times you watch it you will always find something new, something you didn't catch last time, something that makes you think. I thought this was a great movie, and it made you think which is always good. If Franz Kafka was a script writer he would have written the pattern to "Lost Highway". Everything in this movie is so dark, strange and burden with a sinister symbolic. It´s very hard to see through this film, because it contains no conventional story, it is just a big mystery as director David Lynch says. "Lost Highway" is full of subliminal suspense: there are no spectacular things happening, but the whole film keeps you so excited that you can´t turn away anymore. It´s just a trip into the bizarre and the depth of the human soul - fearful and unpredictable. I personally think for example that Fred Madison, Pete Dayton and the Mystery Man are one and the same person - just on different levels of the mind. The most interesting fact about "Lost Highway" is, that you can explain Lynch´s work in many ways, but you will always miss the point somehow. Finally this movie can also be watched as a piece of modern art. (8/10) I've always been a fan of David Lynch, and his films never fail to impress me.  I'll buy anything with his name on it(not even rent it to see if it's good).  I'm currently purchasing every film he has made(trying to anyway). If you're not familiar with David Lynch, and have not seen his films, do yourself a favor and see his films!  Now, on with my review with "Lost Highway".<br/><br/>"Lost Highway" is one of the very best films I have ever seen!  In the age of films that are cliched, redundant, and just plain forgettable, the filmmaking world has been blessed with a genius known as David Lynch.  I watched "Lost Highway" with an open mind, and the first time I watched it, it(as probably with most viewers)didn't quite understand it.  I was confused, but it stuck with me.  I hadn't seen anything quite like it before.  I watched it again, and again, and again, totalling about nearly 10 times in one rental.  Finally, I figured it out, and then I was scared and amazed by what I saw.  <br/><br/>This film excels on many levels.  For one, it's an excellent horror film. Forget about those pseudo-horror movies like "I Know What You Did Last Summer" and "Friday the 13th".  This is a real scary movie that won't leave you alone(I lost a week of sleep over it)!  Second, it's a masterpiece in how it's woven together and how puzzling it is.  Just so you know, I like films that make you think and ask you to connect the dots.  I'm sick of being spoon-fed all the answers and secrets.  With "Lost Highway", you'll always see something new.  I purchased it because I liked it so much, and I discovered even more disturbing secrets buried within it.  This is what makes a film fascinating and unforgettable.  It just won't go away.  You can't just watch it and put it behind you.  <br/><br/>I won't spoil anything for those who haven't seen it yet, and it's too complicated to go into the whole plot.  Plus, I'm the kind of person who likes to go to a movie with an open mind because of the element of suprise and mystery.  It's a shame that David Lynch's films aren't given enough interest by the public.  If you're sick of seeing the same old thing in every movie, just look around for a David Lynch movie, and you won't be disappointed with what you see. Lost Highway is a mesmerizing account of repression, duality, and the horrors of the human condition. This film maintains a dream state throughout even when the plot makes a sudden shift. It never trips on its own cheekiness but uses it wisely to captivate and terrify its viewer. The film is a perfect marriage of atmosphere and theme, and it graciously bows to the tradition of film noir and all of its foreboding components. David Lynch is truly a film lover and master, and his understanding of the awkwardness and the pain of existence is has never been clearer than in this film. All of the actors fully embrace Lynch's gorgeously twisted world. A special nod to Patricia Arquette for being so seductive and convincing as two femme fatales. I have already commented (very positively) on this film, but must add something else that not many other people have mentioned--the similarity between this film and 1990's "Jacob's Ladder." While seeing "Lost Highway" I kept being reminded of this other movie and felt I had to see it again. There are many parallels--the non-linear, almost circular plot...haunting images and silences that enhance the suspense...protagonists that are at a total loss as to what is happening to them and why...surrealistic, dreamlike quality in both movies...I could go on. The main differences between these two films is (1) Jacob's Ladder contains a message of hope that is totally lacking in "Lost Highway", and (2) "Jacob's Ladder" is a more mainstream film and will therefore appeal to a wider audience...But if you loved "Lost Highway", as I did, be sure to  rent the woefully underrated sleeper "Jacob's Ladder." You'll have a lot to think about. It´s nice to know that Lynch still is one of the few directors working within the Hollywood system who continue to make personal and uncompromising movies. This wonderfully weird movie sure isn´t like any other movie out there. The enigmatic narrative teases with possibilities of interpretation, and thankfully leaves it up to the viewer to decide what´s actually going on, while still managing to provide a satisfying conclusion, kind of. While not being Lynch´s best (Blue Velvet for my money), it´s still way more interesting than most of what´s being produced today. The relentlessly oppressive and claustrophobic opening part, with its sinister lighting, sound design and music, is my favorite part of the movie. Lost Highway is a great mystery. It probably confuses the hell out of people , but that´s the plot. The movie lets you, the viewer to think. It´s hard to understand this movie, but you must let your imagination go free. I really recommend you buying the widescreen version because it´s a movie experience. Good work David. Lost Highway is a confusing mess of a movie.What is David Lynch trying to say?Is he trying to say anything?What is he getting at?Is this movie just one big con?Are Pete Dayton and Fred Madison the same person?Your guess is as good as mine.Stay at home and read a book,you will stay sane. This is one of its kind. First time viewer feels deceived as you will not be able to make head and tail of what you have seen. But the movie catches on you and if you think hard enough, the plot begins to make sense. Then the natural urge will be to goggle it and try to understand, that is where the movie reveals itself. There are countless plot explanations on the internet and every explanation, though remarkably different from all others, make sense. The movie then grows upon you and you will, ultimately derive your own explanation of the plot. And you will go back again and again to watch the movie and look for cryptic clues. That is the genius of David Lynch. Every single frame in the movie is a cryptic clue and the more you delve into it, the more it builds upon you. Best time to see is about an hour before you go to bed so that you allow it take a grasp over your mind...... I'm a David Lynch fan.... so help me!! This doesn't mean I think everything Lynch ever did is brilliant - far from it; some of his work is grotesque and unwatchable (Eraserhead), irritating (Dune), or just plain impossible (Inland Empire). But at his best David Lynch turns out material that is as good as any; Elephant Man, Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks (TV series), Wild at Heart.<br/><br/>I place Lost Highway in the group of "good" Lynch films. Why is it good? Lost Highway is a "difficult" movie. Difficult to get your head around. All Lynch films to a lesser or greater extent require the watcher to suspend their normal frame of reality and open themselves up to new ways of understanding, new ways of comprehending what they are seeing. It's an adventure.<br/><br/>I have just watched Lost Highway again after a gap of about 12 years. When I first saw it (in the cinema) I was completely bewitched by it. I bought it as soon as it came out on video (sic) and I then proceeded to watch it 5 nights on the spin to see if I could unpick it. I wrote notes, I asked my friends, I threw my degree in Philosophy at it. In short - Lost Highway got to me.<br/><br/>Here's the odd thing - despite having seen this film 10+ times, despite thinking I knew it's every nuance, clearly I learned NOTHING. When I watched it again recently I had COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN about the Pete character - even the incredible "metamorphis" that occurs in the cell halfway through the film came as a surprise to me on this viewing -! Why??? (clue - it's not my age...) Why -? why did I not pick out the TWO central characters? I know why - because Bill/Pete are interchangeable. They are ONE. The story is so carefully crafted that despite the two apparent characters in two apparent bodies - the viewer merges the two and sees further possibilities as a result. It's startling! Thus Lost Highway is "difficult". It's a challenging watch, complex, stimulating. The clues are there, but I'm not saying it's easy....<br/><br/>The cinematography is total Lynch; camera angles which belittle or exaggerate, dark broody rooms which drip with a hard to grasp threat. The characters are writ sparse - they look lost, confused, actually - on the edge of being out of control. Their sparse spiked dialogue allows the viewer, in combination with the sets and camera angles, to interpose their own fears interpretations and anxieties. It's verging on scarry - but it's very controlled. Very clever stuff! I recommend Lost Highway. Careful though - it's addictive! this is one of those flicks you got to watch for a week strait. This may take a lot of coffee. I like mine thick, like honey. After you have rounded enough coffee and toilet paper, proceed to where a groove in your couch. This is powerful film-making, boys and girls. It's a film noir film darker than any i've seen and contains all the elements with that good old David lynch twist. I am particularly impressed with Robert Blake. If you think he's creepy in real life watch this movie. Bill Pullman showed an incredible amount of confusion, more than would be expected. I expect he was just as confused with the plot as the majority of those who have viewed it. Wild at Heart is a good Lynch movie to pick up. Although Lost Highway has the greatest head wound ever, Wild at Heart has more than any of his movies. And thats all that matters, right. Watching Lost Highway is like watching a film made by someone trying to emulate a David Lynch film and failing.  All of the Lynchian hallmarks are there - the gangster, duel identities, dream states, a mysterious man - but something intangible is missing. A mood is created but it's a mood that you see rather than feel.  This film feels like an imposter.<br/><br/>Dissecting and deciphering a David Lynch film is usually fun stuff but trying to figure out Lost Highway is an exercise in futility and frustration.  Does Fred die and become Pete?  Does Pete die and become Fred? Is Pete real?  Is Alice real?  Are Alice and the Mystery Man the same person?  Is the beginning of the film actually the end and the middle is the beginning?  There are too many ideas/theories that could fit but none actually do. <br/><br/>In great films like Blue Velvet and Mulholland Drive I felt like the director knew more than I did and was dropping hints along the way.  With Lost Highway I get that sinking feeling that Lynch knows no more than I do about the mysterious world he created.  Weirdness has been taken just about as far as it can go here and the result is something far from brilliant and closer to simply lost. I'm a fan of David Lynch and Lost Highway is outstanding. The first half presents a great mystery and the second half throws everything into a dark world. When you're watching this movie, you don't know if it is reality or fiction. I find that brilliant. This film was so confusing- on a first viewing- it made Twin Peaks seem like a Disney cartoon. Yet, after seeing it for another time around (and each one, I forget how many, evolves with everything and nothing at one), I'm almost inclined not to figure it out as a connector of sorts between the melding of dreams and reality in Mulholland Drive, and the 'inner-soul' of a madman from TP. It's more about experiencing these characters and situations, the sort of overall seductive nature of Lynch's film-making from the cool opening credits sequence till the peculiar ending. Pullman in one of his best parts (this time having to really 'do' something with a character, however restrained he might be,) plays a musician who is sentenced to death for murdering his wife. That's the simple end of it, anyway. But then something happens while he's awaiting the chair, by way of a pill meant to help him sleep...and then suddenly, it's not Pullman anymore...or is it?<br/><br/>To say that this is Lynch messing with his fans and non-fans is an understatement, but in the end I more remember the images, the flashes of garish, nightmarish specks from reality than the full-on story. Robert Blake in white-face, Loggia as the male-dominating gangster, two versions of a male character with Pullman as one and Balthazar Getty as the other, these are some perks to the film. But there is also a troubled turn by Patricia Arquette- one scene involving some explicit sex is more than disturbing- and a couple of twists that almost bring whiplash. It's a kind of lurid, psycho-sexually charged pot-boiler of pulpy danger and excitement while still keeping a brooding atmosphere akin Lynch at his best. For the average movie-goer not yet used to Lynch's slight of surrealist hand, you might as well take mescaline and feel a similar effect. quite possibly the worst film Ive seen ... definatly the only film I havent been able to make sense of!  what on earth was the utter garbage and how did it even get released at all!  Someone calls it modern art, but lets face it anything passes as art these days! This movie is definatly a select taste, you have been warned. This title was suggested, and loaned to me by a friend who liked it so much that he paid $35 for a region 4 copy. I asked him what it was about and he said he couldn't explain. I figured this was because he simply didn't want to give any of the story away. I've seen it and it's ever apparent now that the motive behind his silence was not the preservation of my viewing experience, but rather that he didn't have a clue. To his credit, this was the first David Lynch film that I didn't give up on half way through. This is simply because it came so highly recommended. I figured that perhaps it would get better, it never did. The entire picture was shot like a bad film school semester project. He simply tries way too hard to be deeply artistic and the fans of this movie fell for it. You can find deeper meaning in nailing a toilet to a wall, but that doesn't make it artistic. The same applies to Lynch's work. Even supposing the story line did make any substantial sense (no one can seem to agree on what it means), it has a myriad of other shortcomings. It was shot poorly. It was like the DP was high and used whatever alternative shot composition he felt like at the time. The acting is terrible. All the talent look like robots. The writing sucks. The scarce dialogue was entirely mechanical, shallow and awkward. Finally, it seemed that the majority of the film was simply an excuse to get Patricia Arquette naked. Rent a freaking porno and you'll get more out of it. This was a waste of my time. I hope Lynch get's a kick out of his work cause I can't imagine someone else honestly getting one. Maybe some people say: It's art. My opinion: It's simply bull***t. The inclusion of some brainless Rammstein songs makes the whole stuff even worser. I'm sorry about the two hours of watching this "movie" on TV, complete waste of time. God thanks, at least I didn't spend money in cinema for this rubbish.<br/><br/>Nobody expects David Lynch to make normal boring Hollywood films. But fortunately, with "The Straight Story" he seems to be back on his path of intelligent films with appeal to a wider audience. First of all, I would like to draw a paradigm between this movie and a painter who buys a 20 square meter canvas and paints a dot in the middle of it. So then he cr.ps about the instability and inconsistency of the universe and how he sees it through that dot. Not going to happen...<br/><br/>This movie is weird, but not in a good way like "A Clockwork Orange" or Tarantino (Orange came to my mind because of the interior of the house, as Lynch tried to replicate the effect of the stage in Cubrick's movie. All I can say is NO WAY!!! NOT EVEN CLOSE TO A PALE, BAD COPY...). The weirdness in "Lost Highway" comes from Lynch's radical misconception of understanding of human mind. But some people obviously love that. Some people love to think about themselves as weird and mystic and alternative. And that's where good grades come from. You don't understand it, but it's weird, so it's cool.<br/><br/>Now back to the "mentalpiece". Things like those happened to the leading character just do not happen in the real or slightly surreal life. Little crazy masterminds do not exist. A club sax player with a 1 million $ house also does not exist. A situation when you kill someone and don't remember... Guess! Ain't gonna happen.<br/><br/>If the director tried to make some metaphors to something, well, he failed. If this was a try of presenting human character, it failed. If there was a grade below one, well, this is an ultimate candidate for it.<br/><br/>Now, I would rather spend the time to pull my toenails or listen to Paris Hilton's music, than to watch this movie again. My country was at war some 14 years ago and, trust me, it was nothing compared to this movie... Gee, I wonder why this movie did so poorly at the box office? Could it be because it totally sucked!? I mean, WOW! There was no point to this movie. I have heard people ask the question, "When is David Lynch going to get back to that level of film making like when he made "Blue Velvet?" Well, I got news for you, "Blue Velvet" was a fluke! Lynch is a sorry director! Bomb after bomb, from "Eraserhead" to "Dune". This film had no point or story line. Oh sure, Robert Blake had a creepy character, but he was in the movie for thirty seconds. There were other small sub-plots that could have been interesting, but they were not explored and therefore were of no merit. Just like in "Twin Peaks," Lynch teases you. The tease is that there is an actual story developing, but there is not one. It is simply a third year film student attempting to show people that he is unique. How anyone could give this movie a thumbs up is beyond me. I believe even Lynch would admit it was bad, well, maybe not. I believe that all of the positive reviews for this film came from the Marylin Manson fans, who skipped school to see this movie. Lynch, quit wasting our time with your music videos/movies. And by the way, that lawn mower movie was BORING! Lost Highway is not Lynch at his most accessible, that would be Blue Velvet followed by The Elephant Man and The Straight Story, and I would put those films as well as Mulholland Drive (one of his most polarising along with Eraserhead) as better films of his, but while it has divided and will divide viewers I did love the film. Lost Highway does occasionally get confusing (particularly from a psychological stand-point) as a result of trying to have too many ideas, which does seem to be what the main complaint is against it, but for me there was very little wrong (as a bit of advice it is a good idea to be acquainted with Lynch's style first with The Elephant Man or Blue Velvet being the best place to start). Lost Highway looks amazingly stylish, the cinematography some of the best of any film personally seen in a while, the colours are expressive and bursting with colour and hypnotism and the images are surreal but impeccably hypnotising. Lynch's directing is highly accomplished if not quite some of his best directing like Mulholland Drive or Blue Velvet. He also does a great job in not making Lost Highway too formulaic (there is a sense that formally and structurally that there was a fair bit of re-invention involved), in fact it was one of the freshest and most unique psychological mystery thrillers personally viewed. Like Eraserhead, Lost Highway is basically an atmosphere/mood piece and it works amazingly as one. It may be Lynch at his strangest but that made the film even more fascinating to watch, no matter what you think of some of the story the impact the atmosphere has in the film cannot be denied. The thriller elements are enough to set the pulse racing and the mystery elements while made obvious about half-way through have a lot of suspense. Bill Pullman's exemplary here, some of the best work he's ever done even, and standouts too are Patricia Arquette at her most sensual and Robert Blake at his creepiest. The music score is incredibly haunting with fitting use of pre-existing songs and while spare the dialogue doesn't stick out like a sore thumb too much. All in all, a bizarre film but with the mood it has and how well-made and directed it is it is a very compelling one too. Not Lynch at his best but around the top end of his filmography. 9/10 Bethany Cox When I first saw Lost Highway, it was like a perfect example of how to develop interesting pure cinema without a meaningful plot. The elliptic ending almost made sense, but not quite. Only after seeing Mulholland Drive, which I think was much more accessible, I could figure out what was happening in Lost Highway as well. Perhaps the most amazing things about this movie are how a modern american director could get any funding for something like this, and how Lynch actually dared to make a movie like this. In brief, Lost Highway is an unusually demanding and powerful movie about a jealousy drama transforming to a description of psychosis, a projection of subconscious into film. Unlike in Mulholland Drive, in Lost Highway there are hardly any positive images and the viewer seems to be finally left alone with this endless run of dark nightmares emerging from the subconscious. Some have found similarities between this movie and the works of Alfred Hitchcock: perhaps David Lynch represents Hitchcock for the new millennium. I have found David Lynch films to either be so bizarre they are either (1) absolutely fascinating or (2) brutally boring and real yawners. I found this film to be in category number two (and "number two" is a good description of this film; it's crap).<br/><br/>The story is way too slow-moving and too weird. I know Lynch loves weirdness and sometimes I share his sentiments. Few movies are as bizarre as "Wild At Heart," but I own it and watch it every now and then, as I do with Lynch's "Blue Velvet" and "Mulholland Drive." I can even watch a really slow film of his like "The Straight Story." However, one viewing on this movie was more than enough. To me, this is Lynch at his worst, and when he's bad, he's almost unwatchable.<br/><br/>Speaking of weird, what was up with actor Robert Blake dressed almost as some woman with a lot of facial makeup? Well, he certainly fits into a Lynch film, I'll say that. Blake has always been a strange dude......but you know that.<br/><br/>Bill Pullman is jazz musician "Fred Madison" and Patricia Arquette is his sexy wife, "Renee." Fred thinks Renee is cheating on him. Enter the mysterious black-dressed, ultra-white faced Blake and bizarre things with videotape ensue, all leading to a murder and Fred (along with us) not sure what the hell is going on. It gets far more confusing when an entirely new set a characters begins another story. It's too bizarre, too weird and simply too much. When Lynch is dead-on (which is less than half the time) he makes mesmerizing films, but when he's totally whacked the result is a mess like this film. I study cinematography, i just couldn't watch the movie till the end, the light and the scene is so badly lit i think an amateur directed the cinematography in this movie. Nevertheless i donț judge a book by its cover, if the story is good i can handle the fact that the director of photography was terrible at his job, but the story wasn't good, it was awful, its just a mix up of twisted boring unrelated events, nothing connects to nothing, there is no sense to the movie..waste of budget and production time. I saw this movie about four years ago, and hated it. Then, I started thinking about it, and decided to rent it. This time, I didn't know if I hated it or not. Then, I rented it every few months and kept coming up empty as to whether this is a good film or not. I just finished watching it tonight, my 15th or 16th time, and I can say this:<br/><br/>Lynch has a really big problem consistent in all his movies. I recently saw Mullholland Drive so now I've seen basically all his publicly available films. Lynch, you've got some truly great ideas. Seriously. BUT...you don't know how to tell a story. All you do is grab a bunch of cool ideas, throw them together, and fling them on screen for all to guess at. Don't do that. That's the reason why your films continue to bomb. They will bomb and bomb and all the DGA awards in the world aren't going to make you a better storyteller.<br/><br/>Another common theme to Lynch: tits. He flings them everywhere. So the hell what? Who cares? Kubrick pulled it off, Lynch doesn't. I'm old enough to not care about nudity in movies anymore, why doesn't he? And what's with the DGA? Okay, you bunch of loons see some titties and give him Best Director? Whatever. Now I know in the future that when I make films, all I have to do is show people humping, preferably two chicks, lots of tits, and nonsensical scenes of people standing still against a black background, not saying anything. The fact that I had to watch Lost Highway so many times to try to figure it out is a really big problem. I'm not saying sell out like Bay or Woo or whatever, but isn't the point of being a director to tell a story? Can you imagine sitting around a campfire, listening to someone tell this tale? You'd slap them across the face for not making sense.<br/><br/>I dunno, I've given up on Lynch. One less Lynch fan here, folks. Strange but beautiful, so stylish, amazing soundtrack... Lost Highway, even by David Lynch standards, is a strange, schizophrenic movie. It is split into two stylistically and narratively distinct halves. The first half is easily the best of the two. It unfolds like a minimalist horror movie, as Bill Pullman and Patricia Arquette slink around their dark apartment, with suspicions of infidelity between them and unnerving appearances of a seemingly omniscient mystery man. While even this superior first half has none of the soulfulness that makes even the most bizarre of Lynch's works truly great, it is sleek and stylish, and Lynch has never used his knack for suspense to better effect. The scene with the mystery man at the party is utterly unforgettable - the kind of warped, genuinely scary scene that only could have come from the mind of David Lynch.<br/><br/>After about an hour, Lost Highway dramatically and abruptly switches gears. The second half is more akin to one of Lynch's previous films, Wild at Heart - it's grotesquely violent and sexual, a darkly comic film noir on acid. And also like Wild at Heart, there are indelible moments of surrealism and twisted genius in Lost Highway's last act, but it all seems far too soulless, affected and meaningless in its depravity. The violence and nudity becomes tiring, and just seems like Lynch showing off - I craved more of the subdued eeriness that permeated the first half. It's unfortunate, because Lost Highway does seem to be pursuing genuinely interesting themes in the last half - ones that Lynch would cover more fully and poignantly in Mulholland Drive a few years later. If seen as a sort of dry run for the masterful Mulholland Drive, Lost Highway's shortcomings become a bit more forgivable. As is, Lost Highway is a fascinating mess, sometimes offensive and sometimes head-scratching, but often brilliant and always intriguing. David Lynch can do many great things and as usual he manages to make the viewer feel very uncomfortable. During Lost Highway I found myself with a recurring feeling of impending doom. He places strange and mysterious characters throughout all of his films and this film is no different. Another one of David Lynchs strengths is to get top rate performances from otherwise mediocre stars. Bill Pullman and Balthazar Getty are the two middle-weight male leads and in my opinion this is both of these gents greatest performances, both oozing mystery and a large portion of suave, its almost as if they had transported straight from a 40's noir movie. For me though its Patricia Arquette who really nails it in Lost Highway, an actress who I previously have never found attractive or found especially entertaining but in Lost Highway she is completely transformed into a Goddess and you find it hard to take your eyes from the screen whenever she appears. This film isn't as good as either Mulholland Drive or the earlier Blue Velvet but if Lynchs movies are your thing then this film will be right up your street. Dark, eerie and disturbing, this film will leave you thinking long after the end credits. David Lynch is a rare talent what can I say else. The most prevailing and perverse movie I have ever seen in my life. If you have to comprehend it, you must not blink your eye during the movie. Once you start watching the movie, you will lose yourself in the highway with the protagonist. It is a metaphor of the cinematic tour de force which goes directly in the brain. <br/><br/>It left me contemplating after watching and entailed for multiple viewings. It is surreal and will make you think long after the credit rolls because it is open to interpretations. The lighting and soundtrack are enchanting; you will be amazed by the captivating plot and every figment of the imagination will make you think about it.<br/><br/>David Lynch you are a real ingenious. There are plenty of comments here explaining or attempting to explain the meaning of the events in Lost Highway so I won't bother to repeat them, as fascinating as that mystery is. At the end of this comment I'll state what I've discovered about the seemingly impossible story. As deeply disturbing as the story is and as profoundly unsettling as the score is, and as outrageously bizarre as Robert Blake's character is, I was more hypnotized by the decor. What most haunts me about this astounding film is the strangely anthropomorphic home furnishings. <br/><br/>End tables and cabinets and bed stands all seem to be desperately hugging the walls, fearfully cowering in tight, tense, anxious postures. Their surfaces are all sickly slick but also somehow oddly textured, like coiled reptiles. These unnatural objects and the distracted people moving around them seem to be biding their time, politely tolerating one another till at any moment one might suddenly confront the other. A meager wedge of a telephone caddy might lash out with its jutting crisp edge to lacerate an artery. Or a modest, compact divan might unhinge, invert and swallow a balancing sitter. These sculpted, tailored accessories contain great menacing dread. Wall treatments are densely saturated slabs of muted fleshy color, or columns of lush velvets, or pristine expanses of immaculate coolness. It's all presented as fashionable, trendy, tasteful, but their effect is anything but comforting. There's more than a hint of that pervasive late 50s early 60s chintz that so many people accepted as "modern" but was really only awkwardly camouflaged poverty. It's a look that many upwardly mobile hipsters unwittingly carried with them into their new improved mortgaged lives. A faint musty perfume of timid shame clings to everything. How David has embedded that repressed, cloying, lower middle class suburban experience within inanimate forms is remarkable.<br/><br/>And the movie is pretty amazing too. It's a complex jigsaw that doesn't all fall into place till after it's over and you've sorted through the torrent of surreal paranoia. It does all line up, perfectly, but it takes considerable cerebral effort to get there. That experience of resolving this dark, grungy puzzle is more than half the pleasure as you are rewarded with a spectacularly lucid, logical story that is equal to if not superior to any of its masterful elements. Many people on IMDb insist on giving it all away and that's a shame, because finding out for yourself is always the best way, the only way... Attention: This thing is not a simple movie, it is an art - surreal art! And surreal art may disturb, irritate or make people commit suicide! This film may be difficult to watch for normal popcorn cinema movie watchers, but for people who are ready to really think and discuss about a movie even after they've quit the cinema or turned off their television and who are ready to watch this film again and again, it will be a pure pleasure to watch this movie. I know many people who find this movie too long, too complicated, too boring and if you're waiting for some action, a lot of suspense and an explosive beginning, you should not even watch it. This is not just a movie, it's an art! And this movie works like a painting that you watch again and again in a museum and where you would like to analyse what the painter wants to express with its creation. It takes its time, but it's worth the wait and surely precious.<br/><br/>The movie begins in a slow paced way and works a lot with its dark, weird and haunting atmosphere. Weird music, the filming of dark floors without an end or empty rooms, the lack of dialogs in the beginning may irritate the viewer but every detail has a certain role and a certain reason to be shown in this movie. Everything seems so slow and when the film really starts, you're all of a sudden in it and it all comes too quick, too strange and you might not be able to concentrate on the essential things.<br/><br/>Anyway, what is the essential thing about this movie? What does David Lynch want to show us or make us learn? Or is the sense of it all that there is absolutely nothing to learn? The movie plays with our feelings, our thoughts, our expectations and always presents something unexpected. And everyone may interpret the unexpected in a different way or maybe not at all.<br/><br/>Now wait, this may be the key to this movie: Expect the unexpected! And watch this movie several times! Who is who and why and when does a person appear and disappear? Which person is the opposite of another person in this movie? Who is friend or foe with whom and why? Or why does it change throughout the movie? There are a lot of things that you could analyse and compare and even after having watched this movie at least five times, I still find new elements, new keys to a possible hidden treasure in this movie and I am now able to build up my own theory of the movie. But I won't tell you and I would give you the advice to not look for possible answers on wikipedia or movie websites because this movie is personal for everyone and before you may look for other opinions, you shall at least have watched the movie a couple of times. You must watch it in tranquility. When you watch this movie and the phone is ringing - you're out of it even if you don't think so! If you watch the movie and your girlfriend is bored and wants you to do other things with you - you're out of it! If you watch this on television and there is a commercial break - you're out of it! Just sit down and watch, take a break from everything for two hours and a half.<br/><br/>And let it all come to you. The dark and strange atmosphere. The strange music, containing dark classical arrangements, heavy modern jazz music, pop music and even industrial metal - the music always fits to the certain situation. The three mysterious video cassetts and their strange and terrible content. The mysterious break and change of the main character in the movie. The allusions and antithesis between the first and the second part of the movie. The thin path between reality and illusion, the question of dreaming or being awake. The femme fatale and the mystery man. The murderer who doesn't want to be a murderer. The connection between the beginning and the end of the movie. There is more than a lot to discover! This movie is somehow a psycho or mystery thriller with some action and pornographic elements. There are even three movies in one: a dark and atmospheric thriller, a strange romantic road movie story and a little short movie which connects the other two elements throughout the film. This movie is certainly different from everything you have ever seen before.<br/><br/>It is sure that this movie is not the one which may have received ten Oscars, the best critics or the most attention. This movie is over the top, beyond a normal movie, beyond any critics, beyond any prices like Oscars. This is an uneasy watch and feels real and even surreal.<br/><br/>Are you open-minded, concentrated, introspective, philosophic and intellectual enough to give this movie a try? Try it, prove it to yourself! And be sure to live an experience that you may like or dislike but which is different from any other one. Personally, this one is at least in the top 5 of my all time favourite movies! If you like it, don't try to look somewhere else for something similar. Discover the works of David Lynch and watch "Mulholland Drive". Or maybe a simple movie isn't enough? Try all the episodes of the "Twin Peaks" series! You try to be arrogant and you would say that you like the movie but you think that is not surreal enough and even too simple? Than, go for "Eraserhead"! One shouldn't forget the fact that David Lynch is an artist as a director but also as a painter. The emotions have been captured into the characters' faces brilliantly and the facial expressions that we see are almost like painted on the big screen. They fit so well with the scenes. In Lost Highway David Lynch takes the viewer to a strange, surrealistic world full of violence, exploitation and horror. One might be afraid and even sickened of this world, but eventually if one pays attention one will see that the world of Lost Highway doesn't differ much from the world we live in.<br/><br/>I saw this on the big screen and it added some great extra feeling to the film. In the beginning the credits are actually thrown at your face while going on a highway road and listening to David Bowie's song "I'm Deranged". Also be ready to notice some other familiar songs by famous artists/bands, including: Rammstein, Marilyn Manson, Nine Inch Nails, Smashing Pumpkins and much more. And the songs most certainly not are just randomly picked up.<br/><br/>David Lynch's way of combining modern popular music with classical music is brilliant and unique. He's a man who's a great script-writer, director, musician and painter. The music for Lost Highway was composed by Angelo Badalamenti, with whom David Lynch had already worked with. He had composed the theme music for Lynch's TV-series Twin Peaks and the music for Blue Velvet (1986) and Wild at Heart (1990). David probably had a powerful effect on the music Badalamenti composed for Lost Highway, because of his understanding and own musical talent. Badalamenti and Lynch have even published a classical instrumental album together.<br/><br/>Just as Alfred Hitchcock modernized the genre of horror and thriller, David Lynch keeps modernizing surrealism. For these kind of movies you can't define an exact genre. By these kind of movies I mean postmodern films. The fact that you can't know what is the genre of the film you're watching might be a problem for a "mainstream movie-goer". For that kind of person this movie will be pretty boring and sick. But for people who are interested in art and like non-commercial movies, this will be a treat. Lost Highway is all about thinking, it's built on postmodern philosophy and its conception of realities. <br/><br/>Basically the story is this: Fred Madison (Bill Pullman) is a jazz saxophonist, who lives with his wife Renee Madison (Patricia Arquette) in a simplified modern house. You don't get to know the actual city but it looks like it is somewhere in California, probably in Los Angeles, because of the references to materialism and superficiality. Suddenly videotapes start appearing next to their door. The tapes show us that someone has been videotaping their house. After a while Fred meets a Mystery Man at his friend's party, which leads to a series of surreal and absurd events.<br/><br/>A major thing this movie is having a replica, which I think one should keep in mind. It also deals with people's mind - the sickness of it, thoughts, memories and cruelty of humans. This movie can and should be analyzed a lot. But I will leave that enjoyment to you, I didn't want to read any analyses before watching Lost Highway. I would just like to recommend you to pay attention to the sound scape of the film and to the faces of the characters. Lost Highway is metaphysics, it's a postmodern philosophical film about reality and our existence. <br/><br/>9/10 Brilliantly well made postmodern film, which can be watched over and over again until you die, you will never know this film so well that you couldn't watch it. After the raving review I gave of David Lynch's other film Mulholland Drive. I promised in that review that I would watch his other films and recently I did just that with Lost Highway. Like Mulholland Drive the actors like Bill Pullman, Patricia Arquette and Robert Black give great performances but it's Lynch's use of dark lighting and the editing of the film that amazed me that draws into the twisted fantasy and of course the audience have to figure out what's going on in turns of real and fantasy.<br/><br/>I think I figured it out but it took me quite some time to arrive at this conclusion but of course it may not be correct as there are several ways you can interpret it.<br/><br/>The basic story is that a saxophonist Pete (Bill Pullman) gets arrested for supposedly killing his wife Renee (Patricia Arquette) whilst in prison he metamorphoses into a young car mechanic Fred and falls for Alison who is played by Patricia Arquettte. She is scared of her mafia husband (Robert Logia) and falls for Fred where they agree to run away together. What happens from there well you have to try and figure out. I would tell you but I find it too hard to write down. Even throughout how some may have described it as 'mess'. The plot can still be interpreted if you had the patience and the time.<br/><br/>Sufficed to say again Lynch knows how to manipulate the audience cleverly and he creates unending suspense about what will happen next. I also have to mention one particular actor of Robert Black who played a mystery man dressed in black. He gives a terrific performance. Menacing indeed. This was a fantastic film and a another achievement for Lynch from me. I preferred Mulholland Drive a bit more because the acting was better, but Lost Highway is still terrific and it's a pity that Lynch is not really a big Hollywood director but his films will still be hugely appreciated by many including me. The next one of his I will be watching is Blue Velvet, which I know will be equally brilliant. Thank you once again Mr. Lynch for another thought provoking and riveting complex film. One of David Lynch's finest and disturbing films.<br/><br/>Fred Madison (Bill Pullman) is a wealthy saxophonist based in Los Angeles and he is trapped in a loveless marriage with Renee (Patricia Arquette, They get a weird message on the intercom saying "Dick Laurent is dead". All of a sudden they get bizarre and disturbing videos of their house whilst they're sleeping. So they call the cops to tell them about the strange activity going on.<br/><br/>At a party hosted by Andy (Michael Massee), Fred meets the Mystery Man (Robert Blake) who claims to be inside Fred's house as well as at the party. Fred takes Renee home angry with Andy's sleazy shenanigans.<br/><br/>Another video arrives at his house, only this is worse. It contains footage of Fred killing Renee! He's been found guilty, his sentence, the death penalty! During his imprisonment, Fred has really bad headaches and nightmares about the Mystery Man, a burning cabin and another man driving down that lost highway like Fred.<br/><br/>One morning, during a routine check, Fred isn't there anymore. Instead it's a young man by the name of Pete Dayton (Balthazar Getty) an auto mechanic who was charged with auto theft 5 years ago, so he's released and is reunited with his parents Bill and Candace (Gary Busey and Lucy Butler). Back at work at the garage for Arnie (Richard Pryor) and Phil (Jack Nance), he comes into contact with a charming but hot-headed gangster by the name of Mr. Eddy (Robert Loggia), Pete goes out for a drive with him and his goons. They attack a tailgater for getting in his way so the gangster's car is back in the garage for repairs. During the repairs, he sees a pretty blonde by the name of Alice (Patricia Arquette in a dual role), Mr. Eddy's mistress. She comes to pick up the car and invites Pete for dinner. She gets her claws into him by meeting at run-down motels. Alice fears being caught by Mr. Eddy about seeing Pete. Pete gets dumped by a jealous Sheila and his parents are worried for his wellbeing then he gets a threatening phone call from both Mr. Eddy and the Mystery Man. So Pete agrees to help Alice steal some money so they can bail town. Pete kills Andy by stepping aside and letting him ram his head into the glass table! After their escape, she reveals that Mr Eddy is in fact Dick Laurent and she was forced into his porn productions! She seduces Pete but later on he morphs back into Fred Madison.<br/><br/>Once more meeting the Mystery Man, he says that Alice is a liar, she's been Renee all along. Fred breaks into Mr. Eddy's room, bundles him into his Mercedes and takes him into the desert. Then Fred beats Mr. Eddy/Dick Laurent up then the Mystery Man turns up and reveals that he knew that Renee and Dick were having an affair, so the Mystery Man shoots him dead. Fred returns to his old home to speak that quote from the beginning of the film "Dick Laurent is dead" but the detectives in pursuit of Pete Dayton find him so they begin chase to an unknown conclusion.<br/><br/>Some off-topic trivia, this was very influential on the 2001 horror game hit Silent Hill 2 with plot points like repressed memories, murder, a monster trying to reveal the truth and dual personalities.<br/><br/>Overall this is rated between 10 and 9 and a half out of 10 Must see if you're a Silent Hill or a David Lynch fan The Mystery Man played by Robert Blake could in fact be a homosexual shapshifting sorcerer. Patricia Arquette's character is the mystery man. This is how he steals energy from men, by being a beautiful woman... Being in two places at once, shapshifting, the control of people, events and even death to increase personal power is common place within sorcery. Carlos Castaneda books are filled with similar motifs...<br/><br/>In the start of the film his face is within the woman.... Bill Pulman feels the influence of him.... hence the lens focus on her nails in this earlier scenes. The film is filled with such hints... The photograph with two woman then one.... The boy saying he wants her when making love in the desert in front of the car and her replying "You can never have me" and her disappearing into the house and him chasing her only to find the mystery man inside. The dissolute house in the desert is also very Carlos Castaneda...<br/><br/>Email me on techstylestudio@yahoo.com if you want to discuss further... After seeing Lost Highway for the second time recently, I decided to go back and look at some of the online analysis. Most of it, like most of the analysis here at the IMDb site, focuses on the inherently irrational/schizophrenic/moebius-strip nature of the movie: characters just "become" other characters, and you have to accept that on its face. And I'd probably be willing to accept it too, except that I've also been watching Mulholland Drive lately, which shares a lot in common with Lost Highway, and I'm convinced that at least in Mulholland Drive the entire movie makes sense - IF you're willing to ask the questions "what is real and what is some kind of fantasy?" I take the same approach to Lost Highway - characters don't "become" other characters any more than Dorothy's uncles "become" scarecrows and tin men in The Wizard of Oz. Rather, like in Mulholland Drive, people from the "real" world become different characters within the dreams/fantasies/nightmares of other characters. Once you've started to identify what parts of the movie are fantasy, the next question is why events happen the way they do - in Mulholland Drive the entire delusion is set up as a romantic fantasy that also serves to rationalize the failings of one character. I don't claim to have any definitive interpretations for Lost Highway, but I think the same sort of analysis makes sense here. Just saying "it's a weird movie" is taking the easy way out - David Lynch's films are complex, non-linear, and lack obvious distinctions between fantasy and reality, but I think they ultimately make sense given enough thought. To watch David Lynch's "Lost Highway" is like experiencing something, you watch and see what happens, you do not necessarily ask why something happens right at the moment. You don't follow a linear plot, you just see things happening. At least that's how I experience it. You get a feeling how it must be to completely have lost your mind. You make rational decisions but the responses of people and things around you are completely irrational, so it's absolutely impossible to control the way things happen. A thing I like about David Lynch: It's never about the end resolution (like for example in M. Night Shyamalan's movies), but it's all about the way, on which you realize that your mind is only going one of the many possibilities. Lynch is a gifted filmmaker, he knows how to build up a tension like few others these days. My favourite acting contribution to this movie is made by Patricia Arquette, she plays a real mystery femme fatale par excellence. "In the East, the Far East, when a person is sentenced to death, they're sent to a place where they can't escape, never knowing when an executioner will step up behind them and fire a bullet into the back of their head. It could be days, weeks, or even years after the death sentence has been pronounced. This uncertainty adds an exquisite element of torture to the situation, don't you think? It's been a pleasure talking to you."<br/><br/>"The Elephant Man" was the first David Lynch movie that I saw, introduced to me by my dear old grandmother around the age of 10. I, at that young of an age, had never been as deeply moved by a movie yet in my life. As the years went by, it came to pass that I forgot all about it, and my next Lynch film was much later in the form of "Mulholland Drive", a film that was a success in the field of critics at the time. I was wary of the fact, after researching a little bit about David Lynch, that my grandmother had done something astounding in my movie-going experience. She had introduced me into the avant-garde, experimental aspects of directing and writing, without having the slightest clue.<br/><br/>After a binge of renting and watching a mass of films that decidedly shaped my view of film-making, the power of surreal and imagination, I was home, at last, in the hands of the creative minds behind that substance that makes great cinema.<br/><br/>"Film to me is a magical medium that makes you dream... allows you to dream in the dark." -David Lynch<br/><br/>Transfixed on worlds that delve deeper than fiction and transcend our deepest fears and dreams, I found myself in the local video store one night, and some unexplained impulse drew me to a video that only sounded faintly familiar. I brought it home, but it was awfully late, and I ended up falling asleep before I even really caught a glimpse of what the movie was about. My dreams on the couch that night were exceptionally strange, and I remember (as fabricated as this sounds), images and feelings that could only be expressed as being lost in the desert along the side of a winding road.<br/><br/>The movie, was returned without being watched all the way through, but when I finally came back and gave it a second shot, David Lynch's "Lost Highway" was one of the most disturbing, dreamlike, and memorable movies that I'd ever seen. Scary at some points, to extents that I actually turned it off a couple of times to catch breathers.<br/><br/>The filming location of most of the inside scenes were actually inside a supposedly haunted hotel in Death Valley. One actor on the set, was actually convinced that his character in the film was the devil. The film defies summarization, except that it is built out of the most bizarre events that you could imagine. Murder, kidnap, possession, demons, stalkers, betrayal; to name only a few. Some people think that the plot is unnecessary, that this is a film version of what hell must be and feel like. For this reason, you can either love it or hate it. Either way, you'll feel as you would in fact feel if you were trapped in motion and lost at every turn. <br/><br/>The story begins with Fred Madison (Bill Pullman) and his wife Renee (Patricia Arquette), who seem to be struggling to keep their relationship afloat. Fred is a jazz saxophonist, and when he goes to a gig one night, we get the feeling that he is concerned that his wife, who stayed home alone, might be having an affair. Strange things are happening to them, including a door buzzer that when answered by Fred, seems to be answered by his own voice; "Dick Laurent is dead". They receive menacing video tapes on their doorstep, apparently made by a stalker who has found a way into their house. Fred relays to his wife, one night, a dream that he had that furthers the couple's paranoia. But it isn't until Fred goes to a party, where he meets a stranger with a telephone, that the plot begins to jump from mysterious to outright creepy. Dick Laurent is indeed dead, but why would Fred receive that message, if he never met the man?<br/><br/>Well, that's where we begin in "Lost Highway", and I could go on about the plot without spoiling the real secrets of the film. This is because, as stated earlier in the review, the story is certainly non-linear in the conventional sense. Enjoy the experience for yourself, though. But keep in mind, this film is definitely in the same vein as Lynch's other mind-warping movies such as "Mulholland Drive" and "Twin Peaks".<br/><br/>So buckle up, drink some coffee, and prepare to be taken on a ride that will permanently alter your notions about memory and the future, life and maybe afterlife.<br/><br/>"How I remembered them. Not necessarily the way they happened."<br/><br/>"Lost Highway" (1997) 10/10 Hi guys. This is mostly for those who HAVE seen the movie, although with Lynch's films it doesn't really matter:))) You could have seen it 10 times and still be none the wiser:) <br/><br/>So... It really makes sense after you figure out a thing or two about the Mulholland Dr. (which I think is the movie of all times, much higher than even the Lost Highway, since Mulholland Dr. has as many spiritual messages as your normal Indian Upanishad, Sutra or a Buddhist koan). First, you have to pick a point of reality here. What follows is just a possible exercise to get you going. Having liked Mulh.Dr., I figure, why not begin from the middle, from the Pete in his workshop. Most probably a VERY ordinary guy, nothing like we see in the movie. Most probably the sad reality is that the guy catches a glimpse of the local mafia boss with his exceptional lass, fantasizes about loads of easy sex with her, croaks his Sheila friend and rationalizes it with another fantasy about being Fred, protecting/revenging his family life and killing Eddie... And the truth of the matter is that Pete is never out of the prison throughout the movie, he is just sitting there awaiting his electric chair and fantasizing his double-nested rationalizations and wishes. But they don't hold well, and both at the beginning and at the end we just see an empty highway, with someone tearing at it, but who is that someone? A crazy misguided wishful thinker, a nobody imagining himself into an even worse nobody... Is that us??<br/><br/>A wakeup call for us. Why don't we be real, let go of the false identifications, gaze beyond illusion, towards Vaikuntha at last... What do you think? David Lynch creates another incredibly interesting, mesmerising, beautiful, and dark experience which at times surpasses both Eraserhead and Blue Velvet, but which will probably completely confuse you, at least the first time you see it. Featuring vast amounts of imagery in every shot, apparently differing and interweaving plots, a large cast who are all excellent, Lost Highway is a film which you are not likely to forget.<br/><br/>Bill Pullman stars as Fred, a saxophonist who lives in an awkward relationship with his beautiful wife Renee, played by Patricia Arquette. He never seems to be able to get close to her, even though they have been together for supposedly years. When he finds a videotape at his doorstep, he watches in horror as it shows the inside of their house-someone has been coming in and watching them at night. At a party, a mystery man (Blake) seems overly interested in him and claims he is at Fred's house now, even though they are standing together at this party at another house. Fred phones home, and the mystery man answers, being at both ends of the phone. Fred and Renee leave. When Fred finds another tape which shows him killing his wife he is arrested as his wife has been killed. On death row he suddenly changes into another man-Pete, with his own life and family. The cops let him go, but follow him. He is a mechanic who, like in Blue Velvet, becomes involved with a shady character called Mr Eddy with a violent temper and his mistress Alice, also played by Arquette. Pete is intrigued by Alice, and the two sleep together. Alice cries out to be rescued from her life, so Pete and her concoct a plan to save her. However, she does not appear to be all she seems, and Pete knows he is in too deep but cannot escape. He cannot get a concrete hold of Alice. Then things get strange.<br/><br/>As with any real piece of art, you can come up with your own thoughts and explanations of what you see and hear while watching Lost Highway. The entire film is designed to haunt and disturb, from the slightly abnormal sets, to the look of certain characters, to the music, images and performances. At times this is incredibly quiet, and the volume must be played at full blast to hear what is being said. There are a few violent scenes, lots of sex which never seems erotic, but always necessary. Most of the actors give understated, cold performances and rarely try to explain what is happening to themselves, but special mention must go to Richard Pryor. He plays the wheelchair bound Arnie who works with Pete, but it must rank as one of the most terrifying performances ever. It is in an untouchable way, deeply unsettling, those eyes seem to see everything that no-one would ever want to see. Apparently at an early showing, certain scenes were mixed up so the film played in a different order. Perhaps linear story-telling is not always needed. Unfortunately for most people, the story needs to be safe and simple, so they will be turned off by this. The film never attempts to show any sense of happiness, hope, or light in the traditional sense, and is therefore always distant meaning we must watch it more closely to find something good, and inevitably succumb to the unsavoury acts and tone which can become almost unbearable. If you want a thoroughly challenging and original film, then Lost Highway is a must.<br/><br/>7.5 out of 10 After Mulholland Drive, Lost Highway seems lacking. Before Mulholland Drive it seemed a masterwork for Lynch but now it compares unfavorably with Lynch's newest work. In Lost Highway, the circular story is directed with flair and subtlety while the transformation of the lead character half-way through into someone else is a bold strike of genius. However, after watching this film again I was struck by its many flaws. After a brilliant opening on par with Mulholland Drive, the story meanders into a Tarantionesque world which seems formulaic and unworthy of Lynch's cinematic brilliance.Moreover, Lynch and Gifford revert to explaining elements of the film that should have been left for the viewer to ponder. The ending, however, is a masterstroke and plasters some of the cuts Lynch should have made. One of a kind, no other movie puts you inside a character, seeing and feeling things the way he does, not just feeling compassion for the actors...A Landmark.. From the genial mind of David Lynch, the Da Vinci of movies So maybe you won't get it! So maybe you are not supposed to!  Lynch made this film for his fans, pure and simple.  It was made for us to open our minds and experience a new realm of love, hate, and madness.  Like a great painting, you must look at this film over and over and interpret it in your own way.  Not how some critic sees it, how your friend sees it, not even as the artist Lynch himself sees it. To me, it does not look like any ordinary movie. It is like something pulled out deep from someone's head (maybe yours...), like our fears and madness. It a lot weird and sometimes it doesn't make much sense, characters mix, different (?) stories super-impose... just like a dream or nightmare. It's definitely different, so it definitely deserves to be seen. This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>Lost Highway is directed by David Lynch. The movie is a mystery centered on a man that attempts to solve how he is being filmed by a mysterious man. The movie culminates with his significant other being killed and his arrest. However, the movie then takes a turn as he morphs into another identity. As he goes to his new life, similar patterns emerge and he is once again on the run.<br/><br/>Lost Highway demands much from the audience. For one it is not easy to understand. The plot can appear convoluted and nonsensical at first glance. The movie does not hold the audience's hand as events unfold. Images may appear to the audience that they may not understand initially, however I would recommend that the audience be patient with how the movie is presented. The movie is richer for not giving out the answer to the mystery. It is also best to explore the psychological nature of this movie and allow yourself to for your own conclusion. David Lynch did an admirable job with his budget. I felt that every scene went as well as it could have. Although the low budget is apparent, it does not detract from the experience.<br/><br/>Lost Highway is incredibly difficult to recommend as I feel it does much to prevent immediate audience engagement. The audience must be incredibly patient in order to enjoy the movie and to get the most out of it. I would recommend Lost Highway to any audience member that is willing to spend time with a unique story.<br/><br/>Grade: B Tried: Plot Summary, Synopsis, Parents Guide. If I watch this film several more times, I might begin to detect some kind of a plot or meaning concealed in its depths. Sadly, the mental effort does not seem worth while. So I'll just give it 4 stars, and leave it for others to unravel. Maybe, in time, they will be able to explain it to me more fully. I've read the synopsis, but it's way over my head. Why do you watch movies? To enjoy? To learn?
To seek answers? Well do welcome yourself if you want mystery and surrealism..
This is my first Lynch movie,so i ll be short.,<br/><br/>Does every movie needs to have a story?
A good ending?why?
Why you can't take something different?
Why you can't challenge your own brain?<br/><br/>Mr.Lynch is here to break the stereotype,
This movie is an art,from music to camera,from a person's grimm nightmare to a rock concert.
Thrill, horror, twists,romance (u bet)is there,
& Those beautifuly haunted slow shots of blood n massacre,a subtle touch of humour,
God i can discuss about them all night long!<br/><br/>And about that plot.,<br/><br/>There's none.
Its about a person & his knightmare,
"Dreams are only real,when we are in them"
& Nobody,no one can handle their OWN dream,but as viewers our mind is forcing us to make a meaning out of the movie, perfectly normal, nothing bad or something to be sad off but can't you see this is the exact thing is what the director wants from us,no matter how much agonizing pain or confusion you have during the movie,
Our ideas,our input,our perception is the only thing which constructs the movie.<br/><br/><br/><br/>So,
This movie is a dream,
Imagine yourself, having a dream which includes every person you have ever met,
Is trying to embarrass you,to torment you,
what would you do?<br/><br/>"Would you wake up or fight back?"<br/><br/>This movie is divided between waking up & fighting back,only the real issue is we can't control it.
So enjoy it.
Enjoy the art,own the pain & use your brain to broad the spectrum. The film was pretty well done. Good acting and soundtrack. Personally it was a bit confusing but still a very good watch. I'll give a 7.5/10<br/><br/>Overall, just the middle did not seem plausible but then after looking back it looks and make sense. The end is where the protagonist is killed basically and the movie is almost in his head. I did not like "Lost Highway" the first time that I watched it. But it stuck with me, and certain scenes kept recurring in my mind, until I finally tracked it down and got around to seeing it again the other night. I am glad I did, and I am looking forward to giving it a third viewing. I won't go in to the plot outline here, plenty of other people on this site have done so, but what I will say is that "Lost Highway" is best viewed as a movie of two halves, which go in their separate directions but contain similar tropes and the same actors, before crashing together at the end. David Lynch is a genius, but you can't help but feel like he has taken serious liberties with the viewer as you watch this. "Lost Highway" will frustrate, it might even bore you, as equally as it will enthral and excite you. The first half of this film is one of the finest pieces of film-making ever made. It is also one of the most terrifying. And yet it is so simple, but it is the tower-house performances and the excellent cinematography that make it so. The tension and drama is subtle, in contrast to the dark, brooding colours of the house that we spend the first half in. Pullman and Arquette are tremendous as the husband and wife. The husband is a musician and when the wife tells him that she does not want to go to his show tonight he appears to brush it off, but the tension rockets. This is film-making at its finest. And it is so simple. It is like a stage performance. The house in quiet suburbia is suffocating in dark black and red colours, and then the video tapes begin to arrive, and things get even worse. The tension reaches its cataclysmic crescendo with the infamous party scene. Enter Robert Blake as the Mystery Man, one of the most powerful and terrifying sequences in cinema history. Freudian psychoanalytic interpretations aside, I just love that Bill Pullman's career went:
1995 Casper
1996 Independence Day
1997 Lost Highway<br/><br/>Fred: "I like to remember things my own way"<br/><br/>Cop: "What does that mean?"<br/><br/>Fred: "How i remember them, not necessarily how they happened"<br/><br/>Maybe this explains the whole movie? I dont know.... My brain hurts! Just watched this again, this time on Blu-ray, so everything is much clearer, brighter and easier to understand.... Truth is everyone likes a good mystery, something to get ones teeth into and solve in our own way. Trouble is with most such tales the writer tends to start with the answer and work back to provide the maze for us to negotiate and this can be predictable. Some have suggested Lynch himself may not be fully able to explain every element of this wondrous experience and what a marvellous notion that it. Certainly this is so beautifully directed with everything looking so angular and surreal with, of course, perfect audio accompaniment. Like a dream this seems to make perfect sense and then veers off and like some nightmare lurches away from our happy path. The portrayal here of seeming innocent and sexy women as femme fatale like mermaids with long legs and criminal minds is slightly concerning, even if both are played by the delectable Patricia Arquette. And just who is that imp like devil creature but yet another bad man awaiting his fate? No simple tale, yet hardly very complicated either and whilst some dreams seem to last a lifetime but are only 20 minutes, so this at some two hours plus rushes by at the most leisurely of paces. A pretty typical mind bender from David Lynch, a sort of warm up to his ultimate masterpiece, "Mulholland Drive," though I do have to say that my practice watching David Lynch movies has paid off and I didn't find this film to be nearly as incoherent as I might have at an earlier time in my life.<br/><br/>Bill Pullman plays a jazz saxophonist who's framed for the murder of his wife. Or a least he plays a jazz saxophonist until he morphs into a mechanic played by a completely different actor. Until he morphs back into Bill Pullman. And his wife isn't really dead. Or maybe she is dead, but there's another woman who looks just like her. Or maybe they're really two facets of the same woman. And why does Robert Blake look like someone's creepy aunt dressed up as Joel Grey from "Cabaret"?<br/><br/>This is David Lynch, so asking such questions is bound to result in a head-slamming-into-wall incident. Better to just relax into the film's noirish vibe, which for me is always easy to do, and think about how the movie makes you feel rather than what it's about.<br/><br/>Grade: A- Saxophonist Fred Madison and his wife, Rene, begin once to receive anonymous wrappers with videotapes. On them spouses, in whose relations and without that there is a tension hidden from the eyes, see their home and themselves, as if shot by a hidden camera. But on the last tape something was shot that makes you feel numb, namely, the murder of Fred Rene. However, before this message arrives, Fred meets at the club a strange demonic man, who seriously asserts that he is currently at Fred's house. In proof - he stretches the phone and offers to call. Tomorrow Fred is arrested.
In prison on the eve of the execution, Fred turns into another person - Peter's mechanic - and acquires a completely different appearance. Therefore, the guards have nothing left but to release the unknown to the will. Here begins a second story, as it were - the relationship between Peter and platinum blonde Alice, who resembles Rene as two drops of water. After a series of bloody misadventures with Peter, a reverse metamorphosis occurs, and he again becomes Fred.
Lynch, following his rules, does not answer the (for many people mistakenly main) question: do we deal with a split consciousness of the main character, or is everything shown here a story of mental insanity dressed in a mystical aura? The director, who increasingly actively uses surrealistic images in his paintings, addressed to the viewer's subconsciousness, surpassed himself this time. As a result, "The Lost Way" has become perhaps the most hypnotic and fascinating of his creation.
Like a drug, the film draws into the pool of unknown sensations and on this plotless journey offers neither a climax nor a denouement. An outlandish psychedelic puzzle, addressed to something vague, but threatening and disturbing, is surreal before an excess, before idiosyncrasy. And this is its essence and its beauty.
The tangible impact of video art, the absence of a tangible reality, a series of substitutions, a tendency to peep, the indispensable presence of a femme fatale, plus the whole is the magic work of the operator Peter Deming and unforgettable music by Angelo Badalamenti.
The cinema of the 1990s began to search harder and harder for the energy hidden in the celluloid. As a result, this energy began to crowd out the usual artistic images that were previously developed mainly in European cinema. Lynch, at first glance, seems to be taking on serious topics, but bravely goes beyond the limits of common sense, balancing somewhere in the dim space between real and fantasy, copyright cinema and purely genre. Through amnesia by one of the main charcters David Lynch tries to tie together two different stories of two different girls(both played by Patricia Arquette). Four years later he did the same trick in "Mulholland drive" (2001), and this time it works out better than in "Lost Highway". In other words "Lost Highway" is not entirely succesful as a film.<br/><br/>This is not to say that there are no good scenes in this film. The first encounter of Fred Madison with the "mystery man" is brilliant in all its incomprehensibility.<br/><br/>
All in all I found the story about Fred en Renee Madison the most convincing. The mysterious video tapes they receive are just as disturbing as in "CachÃ©" (2005, Michael Haneke) and the growing suspicion of Fred about the fidelity of his wife reminds us of "L'enfer" (1994, Claude Chabrol). One illustrating scene is where Fred asks his wife to join him to the club where he works as a saxophonist. When she prefers to stay home and read, he answers " read... huh" with a very suspicious undertone. In the next images we see him playing the saxophone, abreact all his frustrations on the instrument.<br/><br/>Matbe "Lost highway" would have been e better film if David Lynch had eleborated a little more on the story of Renee Madison and deleted the story of Alice Wakefield. 'Lost Highway' belongs to a category of movies that confuses many viewers, thrills many others, generates endless discussions and triggers extreme reactions. Welcome to the universe of most of David Lynch's films, a universe in which cinematic story telling and time-lapse have their own laws, where reality and dream are meddling with each other. Lynch is the latest great surrealist artist. I do not know if he is the last one, but for sure, the most important of the surrealists among our contemporaries.<br/><br/>Like any complex film or artwork, we can approach 'Lost Highway' from several angles. It's a 'film noir' in which we are dealing with crimes, gangsters, cops, violence and eroticism. It's an art film where we find the cinematic aesthetics of David Lynch's films that we already know well from 'Blue Velvet' and 'Twin Peaks' at the time of the release. We can try to follow the logic of action, read the explanations of Lynch's fans (including the IMDB viewers comments) or we can build our own theory in which we try to find explanations for the duplication of the main characters (the same male character embodied by two actors - Bill Pullman and Balthazar Getty, two female characters played by the same actress - Patricia Arquette). We can immerse ourselves in the horror atmosphere that is smartly built using Hitchcock's techniques amplified in Lynch style. Or we can just let the imagination of the director carry us, accepting that we are in a dream. Or in a nightmare.<br/><br/>In a way, I think it's easier to track and accept 'Lost Highway' today than two decades ago. Spectators are a little more familiar nowadays with the ambiguities in film scenarios where not everything is explained in detail and not everything fits into Cartesian logic and linear time. The quality of the film can also be found in the perfection of its production. From any point of view we watch the film, it satisfies - as horror, as a surrealist movie, as an erotic thriller, as a mystery. The extraordinary soundtrack places Lynch alongside Hitchcock and Polanski in the category of the film directors who know how to handle the sound as well as the image. 'Lost Highway' is not an easy film and requires efforts to watch, but efforts must be directed elsewhere than finding 'logical' explanations of everything that we see on the screen. Most viewers will find, I think, that their efforts were rewarded. This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>Lost Highway is directed by David Lynch. The story follows a person that is seemingly harassed by someone recording him and his significant other. The main character is then framed for murder but morphs into another identity.<br/><br/>The story is incredibly odd and audiences that expect a standard story will be confused here. The movie does not ever explain itself and the events simply continue. This may be off putting to some but for audiences that are willing to accept the strangeness there is an interesting story here. The movie is perhaps too ambitious for itself but I would still recommend it. Theoretically, the beauty of a surrealist feature is that it can be interpreted numerous ways. Up until the last ten minutes, I had managed to work out an interpretation of my own for Lost Highway, but the ending screwed up my logic. But I'm not gonna let David Lynch get the best of me. Some people would go back to square one, and start their thinking all over again, I just enjoyed this for what it is, an elaborate experiment. <br/><br/>The motion picture is laden with striking images and montage. Lost Highway is the kind of film that if nothing else expresses one thing; a love for the film making process. David Lynch loves the film making process so much that he will experiment with anything even if it comes at the cost of story.<br/><br/>Lost Highway to be honest, doesn't work, and I don't think it is supposed to, but it is memorable because it is a conundrum. This is a film that will 'only' appeal to extreme movie goers, but be ready, this is a crazy ride. It's not easy creating those evil nightmarish images, cos you have to be honest to yourself, besides it's dangerous. Only tough people can do that, like great poets.<br/><br/>At the opening, in sheer darkness, man in a car heading nowhere going faster and faster. Many people didn't even noticed about that scene, if it has any meaning or not, but I'm sure that everybody who adore nightmare knows his direction.<br/><br/>Alice's dream is probably to be famous, big in showbiz. But only she could do is what she doesn't like. Her own destiny, it's her enemy. It's impossible to runaway, that's the cause, she flirted around, using her face and body. That's her way of revenge. That's femme fatale. OK, I know that David Lynch puts out some strange stuff, but this sort of takes the cake. After reading some of the comments, et cetera on IMDb, I realized that I was utterly clueless. Apparently, there is a lot of speculation that much of the film is simply one character's fantasy, and not at all real. This makes some amount of sense, at least more sense than taking the film at face value. Lynch considers himself an artiste, and I suppose that this fits his oeuvre. Much of the cast acted deadened, with the dialog a bit wooden, but I do not take this to be poor performing, but exactly what Lynch wanted, to create the atmosphere. You have to give him credit for originality. Robert Blake, as the "Mystery Man" was creepily evil, and utterly unrecognizable. And kudos to Patricia Arquette who turned in a wonderful performance. I have known her mostly from her current TV show, where her character is very much Miss Everday. In addition to the (outstanding) boobies, in this film she shows a beauty and seductiveness with her looks, and her musical voice, that was deeply affecting. I'd have to say check it out, if you can stand the ambiguity. First of all: people! It's = it is! Its = possessive pronoun! It's not that difficult! Whew, got that off my chest. Now to the movie: if you haven't seen it yet, read no further -- spoilers abound.<br/><br/>I know David Lynch is supposed to be weird, and there are no pat explanations. Even so, I was really quite surprised, and a little dismayed, that none of the several dozen comments I read here came up with the fact that the "Mystery Man" is, in fact, Satan. My very first thought, when his face was superimposed on Renee in bed, was "That's the face of Satan." When he walked into Andy's party and strode right up to Fred, I had the same thought. C'mon! His comment, "I'm not accustomed to going where I'm not invited" is a classic devil reference. At first Fred is freaked out, repulsed, but by the end of the movie, when he kills Mr. Eddy in the desert, old Mr. Scratch is helping Fred out. That Robert Blake was the devil is really the only thing in the movie that was crystal clear to me.<br/><br/>Now, whether it was a REAL Satan or simply the devil within Fred, is another story altogether! As in Mulholland Drive, we are left to figure out which story was real and which imagined (or both, or neither, et cetera). It was quite entertaining though, and kudos to Patricia Arquette and especially to Bill Pullman, who deviated so drastically from his usually pap role and stretched his acting muscles.<br/><br/>So, thumbs up; it was an enjoyable movie, but probably more so for me as I knew some of David Lynch's work and was prepared not to have the slightest idea of what was real and what wasn't. And not to care, but to sit back and enjoy the scenes. -may be a spoiler-<br/><br/>Some people love Lost Highway to death. Including myself. However, others hate it. I was offended the first time I heard somebody say that they hated it, but then I realized why. What Lost Highway is is an experience. Plain and simple, you can forget about all that psychogenic fugue stuff and everything else. It is an hour and some odd minutes through which any open-minded individual who is unafraid to rent it is the witness of something exciting and unbelievable. Because this is simply what it it is, viewers are going to disagree with it because they were expecting another Bill Pullman movie that they could use to entertain themselves and then discard an hour and a half later. And they got surprised. More than surprised; even shocked. But, as all David Lynch films go, it will find a certain audience that will accept it. <br/><br/>And this audience probably watches films for a different reason than someone like Roger Ebert. Ebert's a dork. He spreads bad news about films like Reservoir Dogs and Lost Highway, but gives Freaky Friday and just about everything else on the New York Times entertainment page "Thumbs up!". I mean, he was frustrated at Lynch for the way Isabella Rosselinni is presented naked in Blue Velvet, despite the fact that Rosselinni was the one that got the idea of presenting herself that way from a photo of a starving African child. Rosselinni's autobiography, Some of Me, tells the whole story. And not only that, but, after giving Lost Highway and almost every other Lynch film thumbs down except for The Straight Story,(Lynch's most tame film), he recently gave Mulholland Drive a four-star review. The reason why this is such a hypocritical act on his part is because he disliked Lost Highway because he believes it is merely a mixture of scenes and a work only devoted to style. However, Mulholland Drive can be seen the same way! Both Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive are very similar in this sense. Then why did Ebert like one so much over the other? Who knows, but I see it as hypocrisy. Maybe it had to do with Ebert meeting Lynch himself.<br/><br/>
The ones who watch films to experience something new will like Lost Highway. And that's great, because they won't misunderstand it and can love it as much as I do. But, if you are somebody like Ebert, who watches a film only to comment on its structure and how well it blends in or compares to all the other "good" movies, then you will hate it. And that's just your problem. As I've seen Lost Highway before but didn't really catch the sense of it, I was about to give it another try now a few years later as I've become an fan of the Lynch artwork. The whole piece itself feels very psychedelic, and twitches around the subconscious mind all the time - and leaves you with only your own definitions and no other explanations. It's a true masterpiece from an artist of his own original, and with Lost Highway I've decided my mind to pay more visits to the psychedelic movieworld of David Lynch. Seeing this ain't anything I regret, all though my mind still has more questions than answers after those two hours. A splendid 7/10 piece well worth it's time! This is one of Lynch's darkest films, if not THE darkest. It is beautifully crafted and there's a strange sense of mystery that abounds throughout. Lynch has rarely had a stranger narrative that winds on in such an elliptical path. The unsettling silence and faded colors. It is actually a much less confusing film than Mulholland Drive, which was a real mind stretcher, and hardly made any sense, in my opinion. The beginning of Lost Highway is like gold, totally eerie and perfectly creepy. The rest is good as well, but the beginning and the explosive end are what really sticks in the consciousness long after seeing it. This is the type of film you can lose yourself in and not want to be found for quite a while! This is the only thing I can say about this movie I have watched it more than 10 times and I love watching it every time I do it. I love to enter Lynch's twisted and dark world, few directors can gather a bunch of regular actors and make them work so good It is very hard to create "dreamy" stories It is easy to say that Lynch only tapes a bunch of different stuff with no plot at all and puts them together It is easy to TRY to copy his style and impossible to ACCOMPLISH it. In my opinion, this is the best movie ever made First of all, you gotta see this movie twice because it will drive you nuts the first time. The second time it will all make sense then you will realize what a great movie this is; maybe Lynch's best since Wild at Heart. Force yourself thru the initial viewing, wait a while, then see it again. You will have a moment of clarity like a religious epiphany. The work of a true master. I must admit, first time I wasn't overly keen on this as it seemed so static, but watched it again recently with my brother & we reckon we managed to put enough of the pieces together. Same structure as "Mulholland Drive" really, and have there ever been films that took place so much inside the protagonist's head? Fred's head, baby, Fred's head....<br/><br/>What I want to know is, if "Eraserhead" was Lynch's response to becoming a father, what's happened in his relationships to produce these last two movies? Something untoward with the pool cleaner?<br/><br/>Reading the other comments, it's notable that nearly all the people who didn't like the movie had no clue what it was about and how the two parts fit together. Which would make it kind of a bore I guess, particularly if you're into that instant gratification thing. Read the other comments, guys, pick up the clues, watch it again and see if it isn't one of the slyest cinematic jigsaws ever. Lynches flare for exploring the darker side of human nature has lead him to be labeled as the 'king of weird' indeed a term that is rather deserving in the case of lost highway. After the massive guilt Fred Madison (Pullman) suffers for murdering his wife Renee (Arquette) he creates for him self an alternate personality where he lives out the life of a young mechanic named Pete Dayton (Getty) until reality starts to creep back. This is a literally twisted story that doesn't run in an exact chronological order and leaves the viewing wondering `what the hell was that' but indeed this is what drives someone to watch the movie again to try and rule out inconsistencies that the plot produced. Lynches choice for the leads for lost highway were 2nd to none, Pullman gives a disturbing performance as a psychopath yet retains an ignorant innocence similar to Anthony Perkins in 'psycho'. Arquette in a double role hear is quite good as a seductress figure, but her subtly is to a point where her performance feels insincere. (This may be more due to my ignorance than anything else may). Getty's performance is very well done and I can't think of a single gripe. This film gives a frightening portrayal of a deranged mind, and while the plot is not that great, the way the film is made (story/cast/direction/so on...) it more than makes up for it. I have a new idea, we could make a movie and make much money: something really-really bad threatens the world(=USA for our movie), everything seems to go bad, and an ordinary guy who is good (and actually could be any of us) does something extraordinary, risks everything and the world(=USA) is saved. He is also saved, although it seemed improbable a few minutes before the end.<br/><br/>
So let's get serious now. If you want an electric shock to your brain, if you want to check if any of your braincells are still alive this is the movie to see. Please note this, however: It requires ACTIVE minds to watch it. There is nothing wrong about being passive while watching a movie, almost all of them are made for this purpose. But this is a totally different experience. It requires that you forget everything you knew about watching a movie.<br/><br/>
The movie is confusing. It is unclear why this or that happened. At some points it is unclear what happens.Don't worry about it, any explanation you may consider as reasonable, anything that pleases you personally is good enough. The movie is not the same for you or me or someone else. Some people say this is art, and I agree, although I am extremely afraid of this world and the people who use it from time to time.<br/><br/>
Anyway the bottom line is: if you like something completely different, go<br/><br/>and watch it. If not, don't go, you will feel that the filmmaker deceived you. Since I knew that this is a David Lynch movie, I didn't try to understand it at all. I just laid back and experienced it. I didn't even made up a theory. I just let the pictures work on me. And they did. Although Lynch movies are not my cup of tea, I liked it somehow. Especially the scene when Fred talks into the intercom at the end. I can't explain why, but that kind of "solved" the movie to me... What I didn't like was the use of "Rammstein" music. I guess most of you won't mind, but to me (as a German) they killed the atmosphere with their stupid lyrics. just re-watched Lost Highway. being a fan of Lynch, nevertheless i have to admit that this one disappoints me. in one word, it's a bore. really. i've seen ALL of Lynch and Lost Highway isn't his masterpiece. and one more note: of all actors ever been in Lynch's movies, Nicolas Cage impressed me much. i think acting is not the point in his works. it's kinda paintings - you just watch the stills and make conclusions and have enlightenings. all his works are HIS only (sorry, Angelo Badalamenti is of course crucial as well!). Lynch don't need superstars in his films - he makes it himself with his images and style, music and camera and editing and the whole atmosphere. Bravo, Mr. Lynch! and thanks... "This is some spooky s**t." A line from the film that couldn't be any more self descriptive. Everyone who thought Fight Club was a weird movie, you obviously haven't seen Lost Highway because it makes Fight Club look like a saturday mourning cartoon. Director David Lynch has always had a love/hate approach to filmmaking, for everyone who can stomach what he does you will see nothing but brilliance, for everyone else you will get a huge migrane inducing mess. WE start off the film with Fred getting an anonymus message saying that a local mob boss is dead. Fred is a saxaphone player who plays in clubs that seem more suitable for a rave than a jazz concert but since it is a Lynch film we know enough not to question that. Fred and his wife then recieve an envelope on their front stoop with a video tape in it with footage of the front of their house that they make nothing of. The next day they get another video that appears to feature the same footage but further viewing shows that the cameraman was filming from inside their home and even captured them making love. A police investiagtion reveals that there is no evidence of a break and enter. But again the next day Fred gets a video, this time featuring footage of him killing his wife. He is then sentanced to death for the unexplained murder of his wife. But while in prison Fred morphes into a 19 year old mechanic named Pete. This portion of the film seems more down to earth as Pete deals with his girlfriend, a violent mob boss, his family and a seductive blond named Alice, but later turns into the exercise in werid that that first act was. The third act of the film makes no sense at all as it tries to weave together the story of Fred and the story of Pete but still leaves no logical explanation for anything even after the credits role. All the actors, especially Bill Pullman give very mellowdramatic perfromances, like they are trying to achieve greatness but come off bland, with the exception of Robert Blake who is guarenteed to produce nightmares in a horrifying role as an Uncle Fester look-a-like, mystery man who, to me, also gives the films most important line when he says "When a man is sentanced to death he is sent to a place that he cannot escape." If you can make sense of that line you may just be holding the key to unlock the movies mystery. David Lynch must be given credit for his extremely unique and disturbing style of story telling that uses unorthadox camera movement and offbeat lighting throughout the entire film. He tells the story in a manner that is part bad soap opera on acid, part crime drama and all nightmare. Although it is an aquired taste at best, Lynch has spun a horrifying tale of lust and betryal of a supernatural sort that will keep those who like it glued to the screen. Note to the more light hearted viewers, best leave the lights on while watching this creepfest, it could save yourself from many sleepless nights. (Spoiler Warning)<br/><br/>At first glance one might think 'Lost Highway' is about murderous gangster vampires chasing poor Fred (Bill Pullman) across time and space.  But Lynch did not create this masterpiece of light, shadow, paradox, and metaphor to just weird us out.  Under the surface Lynch's film reveals to us a man's soul and his attempt to flee from his own despair.<br/><br/>Fred is a man struggling.  His marriage is cold, he's impotent, and someone is taping his house.  At first it appears Fred is nothing more than the hapless victim of the story.  We see Robert Blake (as the Mystery Man) looking like the embodiment of death, talk to Fred at a party.  "Call me, I'm at your house."  Fred replies, "That's crazy."   The Mystery Man hands his phone to Fred.  He calls his home and the MM answers, "I told you I was here."  The two separate but identical voices laugh, their voices cackling in unison.  It's wonderfully spooky stuff but what does it all mean?<br/><br/>
The key to the story is the relationship between the Mystery Man (Blake) and Fred (Pullman).   Fred is constantly haunted by him.  Even when Fred escapes jail by becoming the younger, not so-impotent Pete, he is followed.  But he's never directly threatened by the Mystery Man.  His threats only come as subtle reminders and visions.  The Mystery Man represents a hidden truth about Fred.  And it is this truth which Fred is feverishly running from.<br/><br/>So, why does Fred change into Pete?  And why does the Mystery Man remind him of his execution after he's already escaped from jail?  The fact is, Fred is still in jail awaiting execution.  That is the Mystery Man's damning reminder and the spoiler of Fred's fantasy.  He never changed into Pete and he never escaped from jail.  Earlier, Fred reveals his tendency towards selective memory.  He says, "I like to remember things my own way; how I remember them, not necessarily the way they happened."  This is a clue into Fred's psyche.  He is manipulating his memory and using fantasy to escape reality.<br/><br/>The Mystery Man is the personification of Fred's memory.  He shoves a camera in his face and demands, "..and your name?  What the fuck is your name?!" The Mystery Man is the awful reminder that it is he (Fred) who has killed his wife. OF course it's a disturbing, confusing film. What else would you expect from Lynch? We  would all like a logical explanation of it. But none will be forthcoming from its maker so we must try to make sense of the images and situations ourselves. To this end the first question we must ask is: WHAT IS THE FIRST INCIDENT THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS IN THE SERIES OF EVENTS? Not the film, THE SERIES OF EVENTS. Is it when The Musician kills the unfaithful wife, or when The Young Mechanic first meets The Gangster's Moll? Is it when the first videotape is discovered or when a man and his wife are driving home and he asks her how she first met the seedy host of a party they were just at? It's a tricky question, because of the disjointed nature of the film, where the normal sequence of time seems suspended for the sake of expressing dementia and emotional uncertainty. This is all that we can say ACTUALLY HAPPENED. Everything else seems to be the surreal attempts of a Lost Mind to embellish -or should we say Justify- a heinous act of MURDER. There are visitations from odd characters, emotional upheavals and dreamy scenes reminiscent of drug intoxication. But these do Not seem real. There is only ONE reliable witness to the goings-on in LOST HIGHWAY: the VIDEO. Fred himself says it: he doesn't like video cameras, because he prefers to recall moments in the past the way HE REMEMBERED THEM, NOT HOW THEY ACTUALLY OCCURRED. Also, keep in mind that the Mystery Man's skin is pale white. Lifeless. In other words, he has been killed - and there is only one murderer in the whole film,  So this appears to be the first act of the LOST HIGHWAY saga, the murder> an associate who was privy to the video-taping of his wife's pornographic films, but who knew enough about Fred not to trust him and videotaped his actions. I feel this film is highly underrated.  Maybe it was not Lynch's intention, but atmosphere that is created makes you feel as if you are in a dream.  If you watch as closely as I did, the plot does come together at some point. I, personally, think this is Lynch's best.  The confussion that is created puts me in my greatest fantasies.  Maybe it really doesn't mean anything... maybe it does.  I love it.  ***1/2 out of **** I like this movie a lot ! It has a fantastic atmosphere and it´s very disturbing and scary too.<br/><br/>When i first saw it , i got to the end and i didn´t had a clue on what i had just watched for about 2 hours. But i was fascinated by it.<br/><br/>I still don´t know what this story means, or even if it makes any sense at all. Sometimes i wonder if DAVID LYNCH himself knows what this movie is about ! I´m inclined to believe that even he doesn´t have a clue. On the other hand, if he knows, i´m glad he didn´t told anyone. Because to me the beauty of this movie, is the mystery and the dream/nightmare like atmosphere it has. Watching this is like having a weird dream, but a dream we can end at any moment by our own will. We just have to stop watching it and go see something else. But i bet, that even people who hated this, couldn´t get away from it, while they were watching. Any movie who manages to keep a spectator glued to the seat through 2 hours, is a very good movie in my book. People might think they are hating it, but i bet they keep interested right up to the last frame of LOST HIGHWAY.<br/><br/>It´s not the movie people hate, it´s the fact that they can´t understand what the story is about, that makes them frustrated,. So they attack the movie, because no one likes to feel less inteligent.<br/><br/>If everything in this story were explained, it would loose all it´s dreamlike supernatural atmosphere, and i bet many people would have forgot it by now. This way, everyone keeps coming back to see this one more time, just to try to figure out the plot.<br/><br/>LOST HIGHWAY, is like a supernatural event, that each time we see it, we get even more desperate to find an explanation for it. In the end we never do, but we keep wanting to experience it all over again, just for the fascination and the sense of wonder. In the case of this movie, a dark haunted sense of misterious wonder.<br/><br/>The great thing about the movie, is that it makes us think, and we can get all the scatered plot pieces from this story, and "create" our own version on what we think this story is about. Because of this, LOST HIGHWAY must be the movie, with the most possible meanings and stories ever imagined. For each person it seems to be about a diferent thing.<br/><br/>I have a friend, who thinks it´s about schizofrenia and about madness, and that all the story only happens in the mind of Bill Pulman, and the whole movie is no more than a giant illusion from a mad man. Nothing happens.<br/><br/>Good interpretation, no ?... And knowing the work of LYNCH, everything is possible.<br/><br/>But i prefer my way of looking at it, altough i´m almost sure i´m wrong. I like to look at this story, almost as a very dark episode from the original 60´s serie of the TWILIGHT ZONE. I like to think LOST HIGHWAY, is about what happens when two parallel dimensions, somehow got mixed togheter in one same line of time. And about what might happened, if because of that we discovered, that WE, in other dimension had a complete diferent personality, and one that we couldn´t ever think of of having in our present line of time. Whomever created that distortion of the line of time mixing the dimensions ? Well, i n my view, i guess we can call it what we want. The devil, a superior race, parallel beings who live between dimensions and control all this. You choose. It´s that open. Why ? Maybe they make mistakes, who knows. Or was just a joke.<br/><br/>Supernatural or "scientific". Anyway they could end up being the same. Think about it, if all things supernatural were explained to us in detail, would we still consider them supernatural events ? If  GOD teached us ,on how he created the universe, would we still considered him a god, after that ?<br/><br/>So i like to view the LOST HIGHWAY as a very,very good, non-declared science fiction movie. Even if it isn´t, this movie is a much better sci-fi film than all the ones that have been made in the last ten years ! Want subliminar and parallel realities ? Watch LOST HIGHWAY, it´s better than THE MATRIX, and much more inteligent too. I know i must be an idiot, for giving such an explanation to this story, but, hey, at least i don´t hate this movie just  because i can´t understand it.<br/><br/>A brilliant movie ! 11 out of 10. I can't say that I've ever seen anything at all that was stranger than this. It is impossible to understand but it was still pretty cool.  It should be watched by everyone just because it's so weird.  No one should miss this whatever it is.  Who knows, maybe you could understand it.  But definitely, the best part is Robert Blake.  He is amazing as who ever he is, and the scene about the house is the best part. Conceptually, I perceive a great similarity between "Lost Highway" and "The Thin Red Line."  In each film the directors were defining human nature through a point - counterpoint strategy. In Highway the most obvious is the Arquette roles. In TTRL, The Colonel and the Captain pointed out the duality of rational/irrational perceptions of the same condition. In both movies sanity-insanity, good-evil, behaviors and character motivation were developed in unique ways.   Both very moody and definitely levels beneath the usual superficiality of BOOM! you're dead 1990s movies.<br/><br/>At least, in the rotting, fungoid recesses of my darkening mind, that is how I see it.<br/><br/>Ray Do not look for explanations in this film. Wow! The imagery is just so intense. David Lynch films have done little for me in the past but this film just won't get out of my head. Originally I tried to work it out but now I just accpet it for the visual experience that it is. The music is absolutely stunning and used perfectly - as is the complete lack of sound at various stages in the films first act.<br/><br/>Patricia Arquette is awesomely sexy, Bill Pullman is great and - unbelievably - Balthazar Getty is good as well. But the 5 minutes of Robert Blake in the film are the creepiest in modern cinema history. Is his character simply a representation of "madness" or "pure evil"? Perhaps.<br/><br/>Powerful stuff indeed I saw the film and had to think about it for a while before I was able to make sense of the timing and plot, however, here is a summary of what IU thought David Lynch intended. The devil (Robert Blake) loves to play people like chess pieces. He also, however, likes to push people to their limit while getting them to fight one another in a sort of every man for himself warpath. In his latest game, so-to-speak, he uses a mafia-type dirty old man (Robert Loggia) to carry out his deeds. When the man finds out that his girlfriend (Patricia Arquette) is cheating on him with a mechanic, he wants to kill him. This arouses the devil and because he is unhappy with his right-hand man or unsatisfied with him for whatever reasons, (they don't tell us that), he finds another. This man, (Bill Pullman) chosen to replace his right-hand mafia-type guy, is a twin of the mechanic, who is also involved with the twin of his right-hand man's girlfriend, which only makes the game that more fun for the devil- he constantly says, "it's been a pleasure speaking with you." The movie opens with the middle of the story, then jumps to the beginning, when Pullman is switched with his twin, the mechanic, to confuse us more. As the story unfolds, just as the devil's right-hand man was pissed that the mechanic was having an affair with his girlfriend, likewise is the twin of the mechanic when he finds out that the right-hand mafia-type guy is having an affair with HIS girlfriend. But what they don't realize is that they're two girls (we even see two different girls in the picture at the devil's rich friend's house)- one married and one a porno-whore, both twins of the other. Pullman winds up finding the guy who he thinks has been cheating on his wife and kills the man- the devil's right-hand mafia-type guy. When the devil sees how this game has ended, maybe he even predicted the results beforehand, he is pleased with Pullman and lets him live. However, now Pullman has the moral responsibility of carrying out the devil's deeds and when he is chased by the police, the devil rescues him into his hell by bringing him through his lost highway once more. What I mean by "twin" is not the literal meaning. I mean certain people (maybe only those who adhere to evil) or every person on earth have partners, special connections to others. They could look the same (as was the case of Arquette) or could look completely different (as was the case with Pullman.) Either way, when answering the evil-call, hence the devil, himself, you pass through the lost highway, a place which takes you through evilness and to transform or change places with your twin. Well, at least it made more sense than Eraserhead. If you aren't familier with David Lynch's work you probably ended up after watching this movie yelling "What the hell was that?" Well congratulations, you found the point of it. You can't be going inot this movie thinking you're going to get your normal beginning, middle and end movie, in fact it has no real end, its a vicious cycle of gaggled together ironic situations. The point of the movie is to make you think and open up your imagination. when you finish the movie, you have to sit for a while and try to piece together how the characters connect with each other, but there's no possible way that can be done because Lynch purposely didn't put enough information into the film for you to figure that out. I don't think even Lynch himself, who has pretty much the most spastic imagination in the business even knows the connections of the charachters. The answer is: there is no answer. This movie uses a lot of a literary term, I think its shades? (I'm probably wrong on this) which means two characters that are a twisted, ironic reflection onto each other, and are metaphorically the same charachter. Fred and Pete are shades, Renea and Alice are shades (actually they turn out to be the same woman) and I think Dick and the Mystery Man are shades also. Check out Henry Rollins as a prison guard and Marilyn Manson and Twiggy Ramirez in a porno movie (with one of my favorite girls, Lisa Boyle). ha!

He is sentenced to death by the electric chair. But, while in prison, Fred's body physically changes into a teenager named Pete Dayton (Balthazar Getty).

But, it still brings out the meaning in independent filmmaking.<br/><br/>Rated R for:  Very Explicit Sexual Content/Nudity, Graphic Language, Gruesome Violence.<br/><br/>Best Ages:   15 and up. Let me make one thing clear from the outset; I did not understand this film. I have my own theories on the character switch in prison and the horrible little green man, but even these don't make sense to me. But that doesn't matter; I've always enjoyed David Lynch films for the incredible imagery, the bizarre characters, the cinematography.<br/><br/>And the atmosphere. Not since the claustrophobic streets of an overcrowded London in The Elephant Man has he created such a sweaty, sweat inducing atmosphere. I could actually SMELL the stench of the Pullman/ Arquette house. And what great scenes; the party, the Marilyn Manson porno, Robert Loggia's black Mercedes and the violent end to the car chase. These alone make the film worthwhile.<br/><br/>Oh yes, the plot. Um, I'll let David handle that one. I wouldn't call this film a masterpiece, but it's not a piece of crap; I admit that a movie like this has a tendency to polarize its audience, but I myself fell somewhere in the middle--the only sin it commits is spending too much time on its themes and not enough time on its characters. Although all of Lynch's characters (even in "Blue Velvet," the closest he ever came to an exception) are really just thinly-disguised expressions of his own ideas. A Lynch film is never about realism. That will keep "Lost Highway" from becoming incredibly memorable, but it doesn't make it awful in and of itself.<br/><br/>In a sense, he seems to be doing on a bigger budget what he did with "Eraserhead"--return to a deep fear of sexual suspicion, paranoia, male insecurity and control (or a lack thereof.) The sudden division in the middle between the two protagonists is not all that derailing, if you concentrate on what the movie is trying to say rather than attempting to explain how it can possibly say it ("when a man is condemned to death . . . ") The ultimate question in the movie is whether that suspicion and insecurity is inevitable or preventable--whether, in other words, Pullman's character could have heeded his own warning. There are more reasons to see this movie than not see it: the fantastic direction (although, as someone who grew up on MTV, I have to admit that some of it seems a little too close to shuddery video goth-noir), the bits of memorable dialogue ("it is not my custom to go where I am not wanted") and that occasional moment of clarity when you think you've finally got it. No, it's not nonsense. But if you don't mind being manipulated a little bit, check it out.<br/><br/>Although those long pauses did get to me, too. Forget about a point to the movie. It's not called 'Lost Highway' for nothing... Other then that I have to agree with one guy who said that the first half our is the best. The rest isn't lynch's best work. Or maybe I'm just getting a bit tired of Lynch anyway. Although I must say I found 'The Straight Story' very refreshing. It's more like a Hopper painting then any of Lynch's other movies. Even though far below the highest oeuvres from the same author, Lost Highway is just from its title a gorgeous hallucinated, eerie, unsettling thriller, unintelligible and authentically artist-branded; this crime story, flooded by a disturbing atmosphere striking right in your subconsciousness is David Lynch in his purest state. The American maverick filmmaker shot in 1997 this feature, starred by actors only he may have chosen; Bill Pullman and Patricia Arquette become the real characters, as the secondary ones do, to play their specific role in this masterpiece. Evil and perverse people, such as the Mistery Man or the threatening tycoon Dick Laurent, and tortured men and women parade on this movie, full with the usual shocking and distorted situations and sequences. Lynch let himself be led by devious ideas, mixing unstable identities and bending personalities, harassing his own fictional characters by dark worries to, finally, subduing the viewers to stare the unknown by juggling with circular plots and non closure stories. The spectator is left lost, in the way (can be there anything more loaded with significance and symbolic than the Way?). *Definite Spoilers Below*<br/><br/><br/><br/>David Lynch has brought us some pretty strange stories. The seedy underworld in "Blue Velvet", and the quirky characters in "Twin Peaks," are perhaps his best-known triumphs in weirdness. But this little nightmare is just too bizarre to even remotely understand. We begin the story watching a down-on-his-luck saxophonist, Fred Madison, answer a buzz at his door. "Dick Laurent is dead," says the voice. And that pretty much finished the scene. For about 30 minutes we see him  cope with marital problems and a possible voyeur, videotaping the couple while they sleep. Fred his wife, Renee, notify the police, and go on with their lives. Then, while they are at a dinner party, Fred is confronted with a Mystery Man, who tells him that he is at his house. The MM gives him a phone, and Fred calls home, only to be greeted by the Mystery Man. Sound confusing? Read on. Next, we see another video, but this one is of him murdering his wife. In the span of about two minutes, he is arrested,  convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death. All of this is done very surrealistically, with fantastic lighting and cinematography thanks to the Lynchian style.<br/><br/>But then, we are deeply confused to see a younger more virile young man in his cell, named Getty. He is released and goes back to his job in a garage. Robert Loggia enters as the gangster, accompanied by *gasp* Renee? But now, she's a blonde and her name is Alice. This brings more confusion to the audience, as we feel left in the dark about what on earth is happening on screen. The only clue we are given, is when Getty hears the energetic saxophone on the radio and hurriedly changes the station. Anyway, about for about 45  minutes we see Getty start to get it on with Alice, and at least two other women, and we are subjected to about three distracting sex scenes. Finally, Alice convinces Getty to steal from "friend" and split with her to wherever. They hit the highway, and make love again outside a house in the desert. Then we are confused even more, as it is not Getty that emerges from the sand, but Fred?! By now, we are just about throwing our hands up and saying, "I give up." But it gets even more confusing. I won't give away any more plot points, but suffice it to say, it jerks the viewer around until the final frame.<br/><br/>By the end credits we are left to wonder what the heck this movie was really about. Was it about two separate individuals with a paranormal connection? Was it about an insane wife-killer? Or was it all just one big nightmare? I haven't the foggiest idea what it was about. But, I'm afraid that's the point. Lynch was not setting forth to make a film where everything makes sense in the end. It seems as if this movie was strictly an exposition of style. Lighting, color, composition, etc.. are equally superb. Technologically, this film is one not to miss. However, the pacing seemed too slow in parts, the acting was fair and (to go back to the form versus function argument), it just seemed to sacrifice content for style. I have no problem with stylistic cinema, but I just think that style should complement the story, not distract it. Maybe that's what Lynch wanted. Regardless, take my word for it: Don't try to find your way around this movie. Take it as an extended dream. Or nightmare. I just finished watching Lost Highway and there is really little i can tell you apart from the fact that this is one of the most bizarre, if not most bizarre, movie that i have ever watched. However, the movie is not bad. It is surreal and slow, with a disturbing lack of dialogue to explain the weirds events that are going on. The story starts with a musician who finds a tape of him killing his wife on his doorstep. He is then accused of murder and sentenced to death, but while awaiting his execution, he turns into a teen and begins living another life, which in a twist of fate, is very similar to his past. If this sounds weird, what until you watch the movie. The soundtrack is perhaps your only comfort as to try and explain to yourself what the hell is going on. With superb lightning and a weird old man that has some nasty habit of knowing everything and explain nothing, this is a movie that should be seen to be believed. Although i could hardly wait for it to end, you will want to see the whole thing for yourself. Its that bizarre! `I hate it, I love it, hate it, love it! Lynch is a great director, bad director, terrible director, best director. Waw stunning amazing, A true masterpiece!` Alright, so some hated this movie, some loved this movie, some never saw this movie. One thing is for sure, if one ever feels like having a trial run at going insane, watch this with the lights off sitting very close to the screen and within ten minuets one is sure to feel, if nothing else, just a bit claustrophobic. By the end of the movie I was glued to the chair, staring blind at he screen not thinking anything. I could not decide if I hated it or loved it or whatever. Mostly because this movie has such a strange effect on you that you CAN NOT THINK after it. During the whole thing I could not relax. The whole time I was sitting on the edge of my seat thinking any second now something horrid would happen. Know that thing directors do to foreshadow bad events? Magnify that by five and you will get the feel of the whole entire movie from start to finish. Perhaps this surreal full of dread quality comes from the darkness of all scenes and from the constant silence of the characters that often movie about putting things down and picking things up with ought saying a word. As far as elements such as plot or character, there is not a lot, but more, there is a messed up, paranoid, mind that you are asked to visit. Enjoy boys and girls.<br/><br/>
By the way, viewing this film while under the influence of drugs such as acid not recommended, it is sure to leave very unpleasant visions till death. what i enjoy about david lynch is that he lets you come up with your own conclusions about his films.  there's really no concise obvious lessons or points made, which is a good way to lure me in- make me think on my own. lost highway is no different and i'll give you MY interpretation.  the following contains VAGUE SPOILERS.<br/><br/>i would think this is a "be careful what you wish for" kind of movie.  look at fred (bill pullman), his life is boring to both him and his wife renee' (patricia arquette).  she is cheating on him so he makes some kind of wish in his mind to become a more youthful, interesting person-someone renee' could love.  renee' is the same way.  her life seems boring so subconciously she wishes to bring out her more wild and playful side-alice.  the mystery man (robert blake) brings these desires to life, kind of like selling your soul to the devil might.  then, their fantasies play out, leaving several casualties-pete (balthazar getty),mr. eddy/dick laurant (robert loggia)and andy (michael massee).  nothing ever turns out as desired should definitely be another lesson learned after seeing lost highway.<br/><br/>good performances all around and look for rockstars henry rollins, marilyn manson and twiggy ramirez in small roles/cameos as well as gary busey and rising star natasha wagner.  good music too but you would expect as much from something produced by trent reznor.<br/><br/>rating- nobody does mystery like lynch.  rip jack nance.  8/10 I'll throw my 2 cents in here. This is an intruging film which I neither "love" nor "hate".<br/><br/>If I was to look at it as a filmed nightmare, then it is interesting. It has, to me, a feeling as a stoned note that Lynch wrote to himself or something that he dreamt. There is no "flow" to the film, it is a feel as if it was just interesting moments connected by celluloid.<br/><br/>
If taken as a true "film" in the story sense of analysis, it falls flat as something that too intentionally vague. <br/><br/>Some will love "Lost Highway", some will hate it, and some will just throw up there hands and go "whatever"~~ Admittedly, I hated this film when I first saw it on video.<br/><br/>Then I heard David Lynch say something which forced me to broaden my mind a bit:<br/><br/>He said that, with 'Lost Highway,' he was simply attempting to FILM A NIGHTMARE.<br/><br/>Watch it again with this in mind, and you will have a new appreciation for the film and for David Lynch.  Let the specifics of the 'plot' glide right through your consciousness...don't detain them in your rational mind - they'll just get all backed up while you try to 'explain' the movie to yourself.  Lynch is intelligent enough to realize that true nightmares are illogical and incomprehensible, and made all the more nightmarish the more illogical and incomprehensible they are.  Ever had one?  A nightmare?  If you have, you know the best ones are those that leave a vivid footprint of fear in your waking mind, but whose characters and events elude any effort to have a rational order imposed upon them.<br/><br/>Those who really dig this film because it makes them feel 'in' on something which defies conventional understanding are, I believe, just a bit self-absorbed.  It's not that complicated of a film, it just APPEARS so.  And, by the same token, those who rigidly condemn the film as 'pretentious' and 'muddled' are, unfortunately, rather unwilling to think just slightly to the left of normal for two hours.  There's nothing like a well-told story, to be sure - and there's absolutely nothing wrong with RESOLUTION...I prefer it, in fact.  But 'Lost Highway' needs to be seen less as a story and more as a kind of PSYCHOLOGICAL SIMULATOR RIDE.<br/><br/>Kudos to Lynch for daring to risk being so misunderstood...and he has proven time and again that he can successfully tell a good story - one with a beginning, middle, and end - so I will give him the benefit of the doubt.<br/><br/>Rent 'Lost Highway' and 'The Straight Story,' Lynch's delicately beautiful ode to the oft-forgotten simplicity of life.  The depth and scope of the man's capacity for probing the respective darkness and bittersweet gentility of the human experience is on full display in these two films.<br/><br/>Then just relax.  And be willing to learn and to grow as a sentient human being.  I did. But after that when that putz Balthzar Getty or however ya spell his stupid name shows up the whole movie goes to hell.  And what the heck was the point of Bill Pullman's character transforming like that into another guy?  I really liked the spooky L.A. setting in the beginning.  Even though David Lynch should got Nicholas Cage or Kyle Mahclaclan (however ya spell it) to play the lead and not Billy.  Or maybe Alec Baldwin?  Bill Pullman is a good actor but he doesn't have quite enough menace in my view.  But a rich oil brat like Getty is a crime to put in this film.  It was nice to see Richard Pryor making an appearance in a movie as well as Robert Blake.  David Lynch himself live in Los Angeles, as do I.  He said he luvs it there cos there is a sense of hope in the aura of the City of Angels.  A city that gives hope to thousands of people from all walks of life.  You wouldn't know that to look at this film but I know what Davy baby's saying. What we've got here are dual characters and opposing realities residing within one man. Fantasy and reality mingle and twist around each other in an electrical dance. The puzzle is understanding what's real and what's not.<br/><br/>
Just ask yourself as you watch; what is Fred seeing, how is it benefiting him?  If it seems too perfect or 'ideal' (his transformation, his escape, his cool parents, the resurrection of his murdered wife, etc...) then it's probably not real.<br/><br/>And when Fred takes his fantasy too far and tries to 'eat his cake' so to speak, the two worlds come crashing. That's when The Man himself comes knocking. Who's that you ask? He's The Mystery Man; aka reality, the death of fantasy, pure unrefined memory, Fred's eternal companion and reminder. The mystery man is a form of lucifer.The main charactor suffers from lust and passion for an unworthy woman.There is some hint that the woman may even be a form of the mystery man.(Robert Blake).The main charactor transmigrates into Pete Dayton, who, when confronted with lust and passion, gives in (again), knowing that it will lead to destruction.The key to the movie is in the statement by the mystery man, who states that a soul must repeat the same circumstances over and over until the soul learns or dies.The main charactor is trapped in this circle of lust and deceit, submitting himself to the temptation of the mystery man, in an endless sub-world known as the lost highway. This was the weirdest, most unexplainable film I have ever seen, but for some reason I found it very entertaining. It is one of those films that you start to wonder if it will ever get over and fall into place. I especially liked the tailgating scene with Mr. Eddy. In essence, I think this movie is really very simple. Man kills wife, goes to jail, and is given a second chance to f*!k up again by the devil (played psychotically by Robert Blake) who's in cohorts with his deceased wife, which he does.<br/><br/>This movie is very atmospheric, in fact oppressively so. It has a great sound track, some of which I missed (especially my favorite "Perfect Drug" by Trent Reznor/ Nine Inch Nails). Rammstein was really good (even better if you can understand German).<br/><br/>In short, it's a movie Goths would love.  :) I'v seen a lot of movies, and this one i never ever forget. The day after a new year celebration, me and some friends rent this and men in black 1. We started this movie after the quiet entertaining Men in black. After 15 min in we thinking about stop the film cause nothing happened. We decide to keep on watching cause there was some tension.. Like something gonna happened soon. After like 30-40 min we once again talking about close the ****.. But decide too keep on watch.. I mean.. something gonna happened.. we actually thought..<br/><br/>After the end text start rolling we all feel that we wasted time of our life for NOTHING.. Nothing happened and even if the point is to "try" figuring out whats the movie about.. It sucks hard.. Good thing is.. I still remember it even if it was bad.. Maby that's the point with the movie? I fell in love with the works of David Lynch after watching (and loving) Blue Velvet and Mulholland Drive. So, I decided to rent Lost Highway after hearing its praises sung by Lynch devotees. I'd have to say I didn't find this movie viewing experience enjoyable. In fact, I'd have to say I loathe this movie.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, the protagonist (of sorts), Fred, suspects his wife of infidelity. She is murdered and Fred receives the death penalty for the crime. From there, the movie takes twists and turns that while interesting, truly boggle the mind. As is typical with a David Lynch film there is a lot of symbolism and everything is open to several different interpretations. <br/><br/>Robert Loggia and Robert Blake really stand out in terms of the film's acting. I can't remember seeing a creepier character than Blake's Mystery Man. Bill Pullman and Patricia Arquette are total bores. Balthazar Getty is average. The look of the picture is prototypical Lynch; it's got a real dreamlike quality. This movie does have a fabulous soundtrack. The quality acting by Loggia and Blake, the awesome soundtrack and a really beautifully shot sex scene lit by headlights towards the end of the film earned this stinker 2 stars from mre. <br/><br/>I know Lynch's work is really polarizing - people either love it or hate it. This movie just seemed like a lazy attempt by Lynch to be artistic. Ooh, how shocking, the lead character has just become someone else! Wow. Ooh, now he's back to who he originally was. Ooh, the movie is shot out of sequence and events traverse the space/time continuum. Give me a break. The thing that made me really hate this movie was the unnecessarily gratuitous nudity and eroticism. I'm no prude and have NO problem with nudity. However, in this movie it appears thrown in to distract the viewer from how pointless and unimaginative the rest of the film is. <br/><br/>I suspect others might criticize me for not finding the brilliance in this movie. I did very much enjoy BV and MD - far better films from this director IMO. This movie is a real stinker. Don't waste your time (download the soundtrack though - it is awesome). Fred Madison is plagued by fears that his wife Renee is cheating on him. This worry isn't his only problem as video tapes arrive on his doorstep, each day showing footage more and more into his house and eventually filming them asleep. At this point they call the police, who duly investigate. His dreams continue to be as weird as ever and at a party Fred meets a mysterious man who says that they have met before in Fred's house  where in fact he is right now; bizarrely Fred confirms this by ringing the house and getting the man. The next morning Fred is in police custody for the violent murder of his wife, a crime he has no clear memory of doing.<br/><br/>From the very start of the film it is clear that we are in David Lynch's world and, if this doesn't appeal to you then this is probably the point you want to get off because even for fans of the man, this is far from being a perfect film. The first hour builds the mystery really well and I was intrigued by it even though it was mostly silence and mood. At the halfway mark we suddenly find ourselves with new (and familiar) characters and the main character becoming someone totally different (or not) and at this point it requires faith to stick with it and not give in to being lost and just give the whole thing up. It doesn't get any easier though and for each viewer their "solution" will differ slightly or totally. To some viewers this will be a wonderfully enjoyable challenge where to others it will be frustrating weird seemingly just for the sake of being weird. For me the truth lay somewhere in the middle: the film didn't have to be so difficult to follow and it did seem a bit up itself at times but I was also engaged by the film as I tried to piece it all together. Enough people have filled these pages with their own theories so I won't add my own to them but suffice to say that even with the best will in the world, nobody's totally fits.<br/><br/>Cronenberg is a great, imaginative director and despite him being difficult, he does manage the mood and tone of the film really well  producing plenty of genuinely creepy and off-settling scenes. The cast are mostly good. Pullman is enjoyable and has a good presence although this is not a great thing because it means that I felt his absence when we are left with the good but not as good Getty. Arquette cannot act and why she still gets so many high profile roles after so many bland performances is beyond me. Here she is terminally unconvincing and her only saving grace is that the film's lack of real characters and sheer weirdness covers her weaknesses. The smaller roles are well played by Loggia, Busey, Massee and others but I'm not sure I really needed to see Pyor wheeled out. Of course the most memorable role is taken by Blake: his scenes may make the least sense within reality but they are certainly the most impacting.<br/><br/>Overall this is a very strange film that will frustrate as many viewers as it pleases; being a fan of Lynch will suggest that you fall in the latter category but with this film it is not guaranteed. The weirdness and mystery made it engaging for me but the lack of solutions and inner logic is not an easy thing to swallow and, for all its strengths it does have enough difficulties to make it a very acquired taste. If David Lynch were hired to create a window display for the Gap on the theme of film noir, the results would resemble this movie. There's Horny Schnook (Bill Pullman and Balthazar Getty), Femme Fatale (a blond and brunette version of Patricia Arquette), and Mr. Big (Robert Loggia). The director seems fascinated by Pullman's $500 haircut and the mod but tony furniture in the leads' apartment; he's scintillated by oceans of blackness punctuated by pools of overhead light. With its furious emphasis on pricy style, and its fashionable dip into sexual violence and porn as a sort of appetizer course, it resembles an enervated version of a David Fincher movie, but instead of the bulldozing scripts Fincher uses, Lynch and his always-catastrophic collaborator Barry Gifford (who co-wrote WILD AT HEART), have built a world where noir is abstracted--made Marienbad-esque. Lynch seems to intend this movie as his 2001--his signature oddity turned metaphysical and mighty. But the "weird" details and the offhand sadism feel tired, recycled; it seems the work of a depressed and defeated artist. It may be the saddest failure ever made by a great contemporary filmmaker. The best thing for the negative of this film would be for it to be lost somewhere on a highway in a far away country. I would summarise the storyline but I can't exactly tell you what it was, or whether there is one at all. I am afraid to say anything about the script, apart from it's very poor, In case I give a vital point of it away by mistake. Stay away from this film unless you are braindead. Typical Lynch tosh This was the WORST film I've ever seen -- I find it amazing that it gets a consistently high rating from such a demographically diverse audience.  It made NO sense to me, it was dark, grungy, silent and sinister.  Watching it made me want to take a shower! The first part of the film is pure '90s film art, but not in a good way; pretentious and empty. The acting of Bill Pullman and Patricia Arquette fits right in, but again, that's not a compliment. I used to really like this film, but my taste in things has been changing. The story is still interesting, though, all the way through the film, but there seems to be no appealing essence. The soundtrack illustrates this, in part; I really like the Bowie song, but Rammstein and Marylin Manson (the latter even plays a small part here)? No way. And then there's a lot of sex and violence, which can be cool film elements, but it's just not at all working for me here.<br/><br/>My idea about the plot is that it begins with a nightmare / psychosis, which makes the leading and real character Pete Dayton someone who dreams he is part of the Hollywood in-crowd who has a hot wife, a cool house and plays weird jazz saxamaphone - and he does a lot of drugs as well, probably. He dreams of a murder (or he possibly killed Renee already, and Alice is a figment of his imagination), and the Mystery Man would represent his bad side / the devil / death. If my idea is correct, than it would make no sense that the cops are following him, but within his psychosis, there may be more not making sense and that some things are only in his head, such as the photo in which he sees Renee and Alice, while only Renee (black hair) turns out to having been real. It's just my two cents, and I would have to watch it a couple more times to figure more of it out, but I'm not sure I'll be bothered.<br/><br/>The film is full of lame dialogues and scenes, for example the tailgate incident; I used to love that scene, but now it's like a misplaced scene from a black comedy. I love most of David Lynch's work, but this one just doesn't cut it for me anymore, in spite of the wonderful body of Patricia Arquette...<br/><br/>4 out of 10, for a story that is basically interesting, some odd atmospheric highlights and the only successful character in the film: Mystery Man, played by an unrecognizable Robert Blake. lost highway is not as puzzling as it might first appear. it's actually an old fashioned faustian drama adapted for a modern, lynchian age. it is also, likely the most advanced and fun film of our era; at least stylistically. fred has made a pact with the devil to be a great jazz musician - as the always scary robert blake says: you invited me into your home, it is not my business to go where i am not invited. the price fred must pay is his soul, and everything else during his time on earth.the devil, as is the literary tradition, finds this enormously amusing and enjoys toying with fred, and directs him to kill his wife. fred has no idea what is going on, because he is just a mortal pawn in a much larger game. he pays by being arrested and going to the chair. as he fries, he lives out his fantasty, the fantasy he thought he was bargaining for with the devil - his alter ego, pete - young, smooth, and a winner with the girls. but the fantasy is just that. we cannot escape our destiny, and in the end, fred/pete cannot hold true as the devil is in control, and the devil is coming to collect... hence, lost highway. OK, I'm going to start with the cornerstone of my theory. In the very beginning he says that "I like to remember things the way they happened, not the way they actually occurred," or something to that effect. Additionally, he's a jazz musician. You may ask yourself, "how is that relevant?" Well, jazz musicians do not play scripted music, they play impromptu. So, his story of his murdering of his wife, Dick, and the pornographer is peppered with different segments of his experience--he recalls the story like a jazz musician. The camera shows reality--the pornographic scenes, the scene of his murdering his wife. He pulled the story of the kid and the blonde version of his wife from the porno; his wife was blonde in the porno.<br/><br/>Yes, I know certain details don't fit into this theory. But I have yet to see an all-encompassing analysis.<br/><br/>Anyway, It would take a while to go into a comprehensive analysis. And I'm sure someone has already said something similar to this. Sometimes convoluted, and sometimes clear, this film represents a myriad of questions. Just what was the point? Who was messing with who? David Lynch's film is so over the top, one has to wonder if the man ever has a moment of clarity in his life. This film is not for people who wish to be entertained, simply because most film watchers will be lost after twenty minutes. This is one for art lovers, a film which seems to play by its own rules and shape the common conventions of cinema to its own means. Obviously as seen, David Lynch isn't for everybody. I remember on January 27, 1997 when I took my dad to see "In Love and War" for his birthday, I saw a preview for "Lost Highway." It didn't have any speaking or any pictures, but it had Bill Pullman, Patricia Arquette and David Lynch's name flash across the screen while playing David Bowie's "Deranged." Even though I really didn't know a thing about it, I had to see it. It opened on February 28, but it took me until March 14 ('97) to get to the theater. I'm 17 now, so I was 15 when I saw it, and previously I had never seen a David Lynch film, nor even heard of him. After I saw it,I really wasn't confused, I just took it for what it was. But the Monday I went back to school and recapped the story, I scared the hell out of myself as well as them. It took me 45 minutes just to try and recount the plot points. I was so intrigued by this movie --unlike any I've ever seen before. So I went back and watched all of Lynch's other movies. The man is a genius. I have not disliked any of his movies --I even found "Dune" to be somewhat entertaining. "Lost Highway" has become my favorite film and also the best film I've ever seen. Sure the story's weird and out there, but if you don't strain yourself trying to figure it out, the answers will come easily, albeit not all of them WILL be answered --they're not meant to. . There may be no real explanation to the film, Lynch doesn't want it that way, and I understand his reasons. If you knew all the answers to a mystery, it would cease to be a mystery. Movies should make us think, and in reality, we DON'T always find the answers. The symbolism is great, as is the acting, direction, writing, cinematography, editing, et al, and of course picture! 'Nuff said! P.S. Widescreen edition is best, Lynch makes adept usage of the camera, and you have to see it more than once. I think I'm up to 37! (maybe more). Man, what a crappy movie. And don't give me any of that "it's art and you're too ignorant to appreciate it"-bull. Screw that, it's a boring sucky movie that doesn't go anywhere. Don't see it. This movie is a complete waste of time.  The only purpose of this movie is to allow people who think they are intelligent and on the fringe of society to ramble incessantly about some plot that does not actually exist.  I always get locked up in a conversation about this movie with someone who feels that they are some type of rebel/non-conformist and that this movie is their anthem.  The truth is, he/she doesn't know the first thing about a good movie.  Fight Club was just as confusing.  However, Fight Club is a much better movie with an awesome plot and great acting.  Lost Highway is just garbage with one hell of a soundtrack. Remember the story of the Emperor's New Clothes.  You know about the imaginary suit of clothes that everyone pretended to see because not seeing the clothes proved you were stupid and not cool. Well. David Lynch has weaved us another movie, and I'm sorry, critically acclaimed or not, I'm not buying it. If I made this film, producers would say, " Well, John, nice spooky scene where Bill Pullman rings his house, but I just don't get it. Your dialogue sucks, the Thunderbirds are more expressive actors, You need to turn more lights on and try and make the movie mean something, for crying out loud!!!" Well that's what they'd say if they saw we at all. They would probably chuck this garbage straight in the bin.  If I'd made it.  But I didn't make it. David Lynch did.  And he's a genius, all the clever people say so.  So Bravo, Davey-boy.  Don't let anyone tell you your film sucks, needs a real plot, or acting, or an ending.  They obviously aren't as brainy as you and me.  And by the way, I love your new clothes. One of the worst films I have ever struggled to sit through. I didn't know who the director was when I sat for this viewing, nor had ever heard of the film. I saw Bill Pullman and a few other names so gave it a try. This was a total bomb, as evidenced at the box office. Right off, one could tell the director was trying very hard for an obvious artsy appeal and lost big time. $15 million was wasted on this project and director. When I think of all the good stories and entertainment that struggled to get funding and something like this makes it to the screen, it makes me very disappointed in Hollywood. A very sad and ridiculous film. Maybe someday a few directors will actually succeed in making "art" a complete impediment to the filmviewing experience.  Lynch wastes an excellent cast.  Also, the music and technical efforts were superb.  With such past work as Wild at Heart, you'd think a better story would be expected...oh well. Honestly, I'm a bit of a film buff, so I'm always happy to see something new and unusual. However, it's also not every day that a movie becomes a byword among my group of friends. When we see something, it tends to go on a scale of 1 to 10...with Lost Highway being a completely zero. You can often hear one of us say, as we leave the theatre, 'Man...that was bad.', only to have the reply come, 'Yeah, but it could've been worse...it could've been Lost Highway.'. Which is a real pity, because some of the scenes were exquisite, and the soundtrack rocks. This movie was just really REALLY bad. I expect to see it on the year 2025 version of 'Joe Bob Briggs'...It's got a higher T count than many soft porn flicks I was subjected to in college, and most of the camera angles actually made me a bit carsick. On the upside, it did have that really amusing bit with the mob boss and the tailgater...but that was about its only redeeming quality, not counting the soundtrack (and even there, I was ready to kill them for the guy squeeking away on the sax with a broken reed). What I like most about David Lynch's surreal thrillers, is his ability to make films with a deep look into parallel stories and perspectives around the real plot, which gives us clues about the central events of the film and makes us wonder how it happened, resulting in a different film for each person who watches it, being open to personal interpretation. This movie have a similar Mulholland Drive concept, we have the delusion of the main character in the first person about himself and his life, it's a trip inside human psyche, a careful mix of cognitive dissonance between reality, distorted memories and fantasy. "Lost Highway" tells the story of a middle-aged musician that, in a state of delirium, murders his wife and finds himself imprisoned, only to be magically replaced by a young man. What follows is the story of the two men in a rather surreal narration that leaves many questions open.<br/><br/>It is easy to claim this movie a masterpiece and in a way it certainly is. But here's the problem: I don't get half of the film and as far as I can tell neither do most other people. And as much as I like movies with a twist that leave room for interpretation: I can not give a high rating to a work whose interpretation is pretty much a white page handed over to me, especially when it comes with mysteries that it hasn't got explanations for. Otherwise the film is fun to watch and feels sophisticated. The acting is good and there are without doubt some remarkable scenes.<br/><br/>All in all this is in many ways an outstanding movie but sometimes outstanding films come with akind of arrogance that almost looks lazy. A movie that no one understands is fun because you can wildly discuss it but it is also a step in the filmmaking process that was simply left out and I find that hard to ignore. If Mulholland Dr. is kind of like a dream, then this is a nightmare. It's similarly ambiguous and beautiful in it's own way. But it's also much more eerie, creepy and at times downright scary... fans of Mulholland will probably also appreciate this. Soundtrack is also awesome: Pumpkins, Manson and Rammstein among others! This is a very sharp and subtle surreal mystery-horror tale that takes some key-elements off gems like "Meshes Of The Afternoon", "Double Indemnity", "Dead Of Night", "Detour", "Out Of The Past", "Kiss Me Deadly", "Last Year At Marienbad", "Carnival Of Souls", "Happy End", "Images", "Some Call It Loving", "Zigeunerweisen" and "Suture" to re-elaborate it all in a more organic and unsettling way, through mesmerizing and disturbing sequences that will never fade away from the viewer's mind and requires multiple views to be fully understood without ever becoming boring, a unique quality! My 6th Lynch film. I think was his best. Most clear expression of his world/thoughts/feelings. For me art is about expressing what's up in your mind/your emotions, from that perspective this seems really good. Nice pictures, beatific atmosphere, and admittedly a unique movie. Keep it uppp Inevitably viewers, on seeing LOST HIGHWAY for the first time, might ask what on earth is happening; or perhaps try to look for symbols in order to decode what director David Lynch has to say about contemporary American - specifically Californian - society.<br/><br/>Perhaps it might be better to approach the film on its own terms as a meditation on the fluidity of identity, where Fred Madison (Bill Pullman) is sentenced to death in the electric chair for the murder of his wife Renee (Patricia Arquette), and subsequently morphs into Pete Dayton (Balthazar Getty), who becomes involved with Alice Wakefield (also played by Arquette) and mobster Ed (Louis Eppolito). As the action unfolds, Alice morphs into Renee. Throughout the action a mysterious presence lurks, with a whitened face and forbidding air (Robert Blake); he ostensibly works for Ed, but he seems to be able to penetrate even the most private spaces.<br/><br/>Lynch has chosen the most commonplace names for his two male characters to emphasize their ordinariness; they could be anyone we encounter in our daily lives. Nonetheless what happens within their imaginations is very different from their quotidian behaviors; they are both tortured souls either unable or unwilling to conquer the wild and often horrific promptings of their unconscious minds. Renee appears to be dead; but then she mysteriously resurfaces later on in the film. Alice at one point tells Pete "You will never have me," suggesting a male desire for possession that will never take place in a dystopian world.<br/><br/>The "Lost Highway" of the title is frequently shown in point of view shot, as a vehicle travels up a deserted road at night, with only the road markings visible. This might be both physical as well as mental; a metaphor of the male protagonists' diseased minds as well as a representation of just how threatening a landscape can be, especially at night when there are no lights to illuminate the street.<br/><br/>LOST HIGHWAY is the kind of movie that consciously resists interpretation, and justifiably so. It requires considerable attention on the viewers' part, not only to appreciate the subtleties of director Lynch's directorial technique, but to decode what is happening in a series of visually complicated sequences. It is the kind of film that demands repeated viewings - not necessary to "understand" it better, but to appreciate just how carefully Lynch constructs it. I am wondering myself whether the old 'you just don't get it' argument is true of me on this occasion. Probably. Lynch films aren't supposed to be logically deduced, I think everyone agrees on that, but is the reverence for his apparent genius so strong that people won't question whether a film of his has any substance or not? I'm curious to experience more of his films, to see if I can gauge some wider understanding of his work. Are there recurring themes and motifs in his filmography that develop an overall psychology? <br/><br/>Anyway, this film was fairly fun. Like watching the 'best of' compilation of someone else's fever dreams. Blue Velvet held similar ideas in that it took the serene, easy-going superficiality of people's lives and then delved under the surface, to the dark foundations that we embrace by night and ignore by day. This conceit is taken to a more psychological level in Lost Highway, and rather than a disturbing nightlife we have the disturbing unconscious mind. Fred Madison (Bill Pullman) is a man put on death-row for presumably murdering his wife (Patricia Arquette) and from there undergoes a bizarre metamorphosis whereby he assumes the identity of another man and is promptly released from prison. <br/><br/>The first act of the film feels relatively art-house. It's more about colour, about space, about what we feel from the environment than we do from the human characters. The house is plain and robust, often bathed in a criminal red light, with high narrow windows like something from a castle prison cell. Bill Pullman sulks around, never conveying much to his wife, and neither she to him. He is a Jazz musician, and in concert he plays wildly and frantically. The terror begins after the couple start receiving video-tapes on their door-step; videos from the perspective of someone who has apparently broken into their house, and who ethereally floats down the hallway, silently approaching their bedroom.who is this disembodied menace? <br/><br/>The most uncomfortable scene of the film, and a brilliant manipulation of the audience's sense of reality, is in which Fred meets a man at a social gathering, a man who seems convinced they've met before. This stranger, dressed in a black jumpsuit, with his pale white face, and penetrating eyes is like a new-wave Bela Lugosi. He holds out a phone to Fred, and asks him to call home; promising him there'll be someone to answer on the other end..This scene allows us a vague sense of where the film is going, and the reasons for doing so. Mr Lugosi tells Fred that he was the one who 'invited him in'. But we know this stranger isn't talking in the most literal sense, and when he appears again in the film, he is never get in, or out, of reality. He is like some vampire of the psyche. <br/><br/>After his metamorphosis, Pullman turns into Charlie Sheen's doppelgänger, a young greaser-type kid who besides his physicality shares all the lust of Sheen, but not much else. In fact, he's quite boring, and seems even more lost in this world than we do. This second act puts the reins on reality, but only a little more superficially. We begin to get overlaps between old Pullman's world and new Pullman's world, amid a B-movie story of gangster betrayal and young love. Patricia Arquette returns and claims to be someone else, and is apparently a moll, and in this introduction of parallel-Arquette Lou Reed's cover of 'This Magic Moment' is used absolutely majestically, conveying the overwhelming feelings of instant attraction, and the tenuousness of the reality here. In this act there's a lot of moody-noirish cinematography, with intimate close-ups of eyes and lips, and it's all gorgeous too look at, but it's stretched thin with the lack of emotional involvement. Even Gary Busey the redneck father only gets mere moments of screen time.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet however, in all its feverish melodrama, had a more colourful cast of characters and a readily available emotional core. Despite the alien-rectangular-stillness of Kyle MacLachlan's face, we were given his blossoming romance that was threatened by his naïve curiosity, and a psychotic oedipal relationship that no one is going to forget any time soon. Dreams can't be intellectually appreciated, rather they need to be felt, and experienced, but you'll have to plumb through all the plasmatic layers of this film's dreams to find something to emotionally involve you. This is something that holds your interest with a morbid curiosity and appreciation for the cinematic technique.<br/><br/>The opening credits have us plummeting down this vague sketch of a highway, lit with an ethereal blue light, and never reaching any destination. Someone likened it to a Möbius strip, and this quite reflective of the film as a whole; we travel endlessly around and arrive where we began, feeling like we've achieved very little, but both the strip and film are wonders to the human brain. Bill Pullman. When he's not giving corny inspirational speeches, he's murdering his wife...<br/><br/>On the surface, this film is mesmerizing, confusing and brilliant all at the same time. When you go deeper its even crazier...<br/><br/>An enigmatic film about the subconscious and the emotions we all possess, whether we know it or not. To watch this film is to experience something otherworldly, yet something that (scarily enough) reflects life's true emotions. In my opinion, that's what makes Lynch a true master, and his cinematic works truly unique.<br/><br/>Oh, and the soundtrack is absolutely fitting.<br/><br/>"I like to remember things my own way, how I remembered them. Not necessarily the way they happened." What else do you expect from a David Lynch movie? Put all the Hollywood movies on one side, and Lynch's movies on the other- you'll get what I mean.<br/><br/>David Lynch is an artist and an artist never presents anything bluntly. He never focuses on the surface. He rather digs deep down and gives you what your inner self actually needs.<br/><br/>Why do we watch movies? For fun? Time pass? Stress alleviation? Whatever you call it, the implicit desire of our mind is to run away from the present reality and plunge into another world. We want to escape from reality and engage our mind into something else that has a lasting effect.<br/><br/>We see many audience who underrate a movie either because it couldn't connect with them or couldn't create a lasting impression. This movie contains these both aspects that audience want. So THIS MOVIE IS GREAT!!<br/><br/>This movie doesn't spoon-feed you like a baby. It creates the environment where your brain plays with it's interweaving threads. I bet that after watching this movie, you won't walk away light-headed. You'll have a big question mark all over your head. You'll spend some more time asking yourself what the movie actually meant. At the end, you're the one who's supposed to fit the puzzles and understand the movie for yourself. Thus, this movie will undoubtedly have different interpretations.<br/><br/>But, at times the movie proves to be quite unrealistic. Although it's all about a man's psychology, if it were a bit inclined towards practical reality then this would've been one of the finest presentations of David Lynch. This movie is very weird, like any other Lynch movie. But the story is quite interesting and the characters are intriguing and not dull. What I didn't like was some use of the metaphors in the movie which I didn't understand until I read the explanation of the movie on the internet. Pullmans performance is very good and Arquettes a fine add to the movie. Also the thing I liked very much was the soundtrack which suits the movie perfectly. The movie length is just about right. I was surprised by the role of Robert Blake but it seemed he managed it quite good. All in all, a decent movie with complicated story, a solid seven out of ten from me. As of late, a great fan of David Lynch, I finally got round to watching Lost Highway. I am not sure it could be classified as a masterpiece, as many reviewers have claimed, but certainly weird, bizarre and perplexing enough (but without a meaningful, cohesive or purposeful plot) to realise why it flopped in the cinemas on release in the late 90s but now enjoying an almost cult status.<br/><br/>If you are a mainstream cinema goer this film is not for you. However, If you are into niche, enigmatic, surreal dualistic existence, with a touch of constrained eroticism, that can be interpreted which ever way to suit a reasonable or gratifying explanation, you'll enjoy it.<br/><br/>The parallel I would draw here is like looking at a Salvador Dally or Rene Magritte painting, trying to make sense of it and soon realise that it is far from being intuitive or apparent. You are however looking at a piece of great art, and in the words of Rene Magritte "Everything we see hides another thing". Similar feelings are evoked by the Lost Highway. <br/><br/>It could be considered as the first instalment in a trilogy of psychological dream-like mystery thrillers, with the second being "Mulholland Drive – 2001" and the third "Inland Empire – 2006".<br/><br/>One major criticism must unreservedly go to the DVD release owners who "forgot" to add any subtitles. So, if you are trying to pick up every word spoken (that at times are mumbled) or if you are hard of hearing, then this will present you with an additional challenge! For many people, I imagine, David Lynch's films are love them or hate them affairs. But, frankly, I seem to fall somewhere in the middle. I recognize that Lynch has a strong visual style, and at times can create mesmerizing moments in his films. But then, he offsets those positive attributes with one-dimensional characters, indecipherable plots and, often, weirdness, it seems, for weirdness sake. Someone has described Lynch as the first popular surrealist, and that sounds a fitting description, although I would debate the "popular" statement, as most of Lynch's films are not box-office hits and have generated cult followings at best. Lost Highway fits right into this model: it features some absorbing imagery, a strong soundtrack at times, and some engrossing moments, but then, when all is said and done, does it really add up to anything?<br/><br/>The plot of Lost Highway, what there is of one, focuses on Fred Madison (Bill Pullman) a saxophonist whose wife, Renee (Patricia Arquette), seems to be drifting away from him. Fred suspects she might be having an affair, but he can't be sure. One morning, Renee finds a videotape on the front steps that contains a black and white image of their home. The following day, another tape is found, this one following up the original imagery with an intruder, it would appear, videotaping Fred and Renee asleep in bed. At a party later, Fred is confronted by a chalk white skinned individual (Robert Blake, in what is, so far, his last role to date) who informs him he knows him, and that he is also at his home right then, which is corroborated by Fred phoning his home only to speak to the mystery man while he also stands in front of him. Shortly thereafter, Fred suddenly finds himself in jail, Renee dead, and the police believing he is responsible.<br/><br/>Lost Highway then switches gears, and we are introduced to Pete (Balthazar Getty), a mechanic who is the favorite of a sadistic mob boss, Mr. Eddy (Robert Loggia), who has a stunning blonde girlfriend, Alice (also Patricia Arquette). Pete and Alice begin to have an affair and make plans to run away together, but Pete is troubled by strange memories of things that happened a few nights ago that he can't fully remember and unnerving dreams.<br/><br/>Lost Highway, like Lynch's 2001 film Mulholland Drive, deals in elements of identity, memory, and guilt. Upon watching the whole film, you can kind of see what Lynch is trying for, and there are elements that seem to fit together, but nothing you can concretely say makes much sense if you follow your ideas through. The film has a very non-linear, dreamlike quality that, as mentioned above, Lynch would revisit in Mulholland Drive, but this very much seems to be a dress rehearsal for that later, better received film.<br/><br/>However, while some can content themselves by calling Lynch a visual stylist and surrealist and forgiving him his trespasses, the rest of us who are looking for something in a film beyond a string of stunning images are, frankly, largely out of luck. In the end, the real problem with Lost Highway is not so much its convoluted narrative, but its lack of character development. The way Lynch directs his actors (and considering they all perform about the same, I find it difficult to believe it isn't Lynch calling the shots on this) much of the dialogue is delivered in a short, clipped and detached manner, as if the need to include words was an afterthought to Lynch who doesn't quite want to make a silent film. We learn little to nothing about the characters, there is no background, no insight into them as people, they are merely pawns for Lynch's visually driven plot machinations, not people. It doesn't help that the narrative suddenly changes focus at midpoint, and we are left dealing with a new set of characters and story that may or may not be connected to the earlier scenes. Again, these characters are thinly drawn, more types than three dimensional humans.<br/><br/>Lost Highway displays Lynch's typical fascination with the 1950's. Both of the characters Arquette essays are traditional femme fatales, steeped in noir filmmaking, and most of the characters wear leather jackets, drive 50s cars or motorcycles and smoke rather ceaselessly. Loggia's performance as Mr. Eddy feels like a mid-Century mob boss and Pullman seems to channel a Beat-era avant garde musician. Again, it is all about Lynch assembling the imagery that intrigues him, less about telling a coherent story.<br/><br/>With all that being said, Lost Highway can still draw you in at times. Many of the encounters involving Pete and Alice have an undeniable erotic charge to them and a flashback scene revealing how Alice and Mr. Eddy first met is a potent mix of sex and danger that is engrossing. The early scenes that introduce the mystery elements are also at times hypnotizing, but as the film draws to a close, and things don't really start adding up, and we are dealing with characters we don't really care about, Lost Highway begins deflating and we are left scratching our heads about what it all might mean.<br/><br/>Lost Highway was one of Lynch's last gasps of popular success. He followed it up with The Straight Story, a very traditional drama that proved he could make a "normal" film, then Mulholland Drive which fit squarely in the Lynchian typical style that received a lot of critical acclaim but again suffered from the same issues that plague Lost Highway. Since then, Lynch has made only one full-length feature, 2006's little seen Inland Empire. Lynch is definitely not for everyone, I might tolerate him better than many, but Lost Highway is a typical sample of what you can usually expect from the director: gorgeous imagery, glossing over a somewhat vacant, at times frustrating, core. I wouldn't be surprised if he wouldn't want it any other way. I saw it back then in the late 90's. I liked it right away because I enjoy bizarre movies, unexplained stuff, etc. And Lynch's imagery i usually quite cool (I like some other stuff he made).<br/><br/>I saw it a few times after, and got to appreciate some details. For example, during the night when Fred kills his wife, just before it happens, he roams in his house like he's looking for someone or something. There's this weird atmosphere, very gloomy and surreal. Something's got to happen! At some point we only see his shadow moving across his living-room. And right then, another shadow is following his ... I presume this was the Mystery Man's. I had not caught that the first time :) <br/><br/>Anyway, I read some of the haters' reviews. To each his own. Even though some aspects of the story are irrational or even supernatural, there is some logic to it: Fred learns that his wife is unfaithful and has an affair with Dick Laurent. Since he is insane, he kills his wife. But he wants to kick Laurent's butt as well for screwing his wife. So when on the death row, he morphs into Pete who happens to have direct contacts with Laurent. When the conditions are gathered, Fred is back to his own self and kills Laurent. He informs his past self that the job is done and the whole circle is closed. He can finally freak out while driving on the highway, trying to escape the cops. The logic is rather circular and simple :) But that's just how I see it. OK I did not understand what was going on when I watched the movie just like everyone else.. But there was a part that I liked a lot, Renee's or any woman's real story of escape.<br/><br/>Renee (or the blonde woman) is forced to be one Dick Laurent's girls because of her feminine attractiveness. She is is forced to strip tease with a gun pointing to her head, and to have sex. The way that she escapes from this faith is interesting, she uses her feminine attractiveness which put her in that situation, this time to get out. She teases Andy and convinces him with her female attractiveness. The techniques she uses are very clever and she is really calm in most of the situations. These are the guns of a woman (or womanity) under male dominance (or manity), and she has to be insidious if she wants to escape. Yet she is not to be owned as she tells Andy.<br/><br/>I think this is a very real story. How you feel about this film is based on the way you look at it... Its silent, steady and deep rooted start can be taken for a slow and boring start, if that's how you feel, you're not ready to watch and appreciate the beautiful cinematography of David Lynch. If you cannot get past the multi layered reality and the subconscious undertones of this film, you are not ready to get into the mind of David Lynch and if you are not ready to accept the end of a film as a simple, poetic - justification of a reign of events, as opposed to 'this is a film, its ended and its all laid out bare' then perhaps you should not watch another David Lynch film... BUT if you can sit, feel, wait patiently, understand and keep a little piece of the film you watch in your heart then embrace all of his work as you will not be let down. "Lost Highway" is another one of David Lynch's bizarre pieces of work, arguably his most bizarre to date. This film fuses surrealism, horror, confusion, drama and symbolism into one unhealthy mix for two hours of viewing pleasure.<br/><br/>The film starts out kind of odd at first, as some movies do, but viewers catch on quickly afterwards (or think they do). Then after about 45 minutes or so THAT'S when the heads are scratched. I won't go into too much detail of the films plot as I'd like you to watch it and see for yourself what happens next. <br/><br/>As for the film itself I enjoyed it (despite being a Lynch fan already), and it has the potential of being fan favourite. The reason I don't think this ever made it as big as the "Twin Peaks" television show or "The Elephant Man" is due to the vague surrealism of the film, making this instead a cult classic. The abstract narrative of the film could be too much for the viewers who are easily entertained by simple movies because no doubt, after seeing this movie you will confused. <br/><br/>The acting was pretty good too, with a cast including Patricia Arquette, Gary Busey and the genuinely creepy Robert Blake as the Mystery Man. Also features cameos by such celebrities as Richard Pryor, Marilyn Manson and Henry Rollins. If you're a David Lynch fan then why are you reading this? GO WATCH IT. If you're not so familiar with Lynch's work but still are looking for a good film to watch, then I say give it a shot. You might like it. It is with warm nostalgia that I remember "Lost Highway"the first David Lynch film I ever viewed (leading to an extended love-hate relationship with the director thereafter), and one of the first movie I remember anticipating well before its theatrical opening, despite knowing little about its plot. My interest was fueled by the Trent Reznor-produced soundtrack, which portended a glimpse into something brilliant, dark, and disturbing. Upon the film's release, I learned an important lessonevery film released in America does NOT play in podunk Pennsylvania towns. I had little choice but to wait out the half-year turnaround for "Lost Highway"'s VHS debut, and was impressed, intrigued, and aroused by what I saw (I was 16, mind you).<br/><br/>What made "Lost Highway" so endearing after that initial viewingand what keeps it endearing to this dayis director/co-writer David Lynch's gleeful belligerence toward linearand even coherentstorytelling. As mentioned above, this is the characteristic that most often leads to my own love-hate relationship with his work (and what leads others to just flat-out hate him). But agreeing to sit down for "Highway" is like signing a pact with yourself: to try, to the best of your ability, to piece the seemingly disparate elements of the "plot" into something that resembles narrative "sense." Not that Lynch and co-writer Barry Gifford have decided to play fair here.<br/><br/>Here goes: Jazz saxophonist Fred Madison (an appropriately remote Bill Pullman) and his wife, Renee (raven-haired Patricia Arquette) exchange suspicious glances and banal sentiments and live a generally bland existence, until a series of videotapes starts showing up on their front stoop, the content of each crawling closer to the matrimonial bed. At a party, Fred is approached by a unnamed man (creepy, bug-eyed Robert Blake) who appears to have the ability to be in two locations at once. Afterward, Renee is found murdered, and Fred is sent to death row (though the killer's identity is not made clear). But one night the insomnia-stricken Fred is telepathically "switched" for young auto mechanic Pete Dayton (Balthazar Getty), who embarks on a dangerous affair with a local mobster's (Robert Loggia) moll (Arquette again).<br/><br/>While the setup of "Lost Highway" contains a definite hook, Lynch's bland color schemes (lots and lots of earth tones, often set against total darkness) fall over the line between satirizing suburban/bourgeois indifference and merely perpetuating itthat the appearance of the film itself isn't as dynamic as it could have been keeps a deeper engagement at bay. That being said, however, Lynch maintains his spellcaster status as well as (if not transcendent of) his other mindtwisters (particularly "Eraserhead" and "Mulholland Drive"), creating an intrigue and hypnotic pull that, while sometimes fragmented, keeps the viewer generally invested in what's going on (even if only to see what happens next). And while the plot sometimes pulls in too many directions and indulges too many excesses (trimming some of the sex would have cut down the overlong run time), the denouement will leave your mind swimming in thoughtan act that runs contrary to just about every film that hits theaters these days.<br/><br/>But this begs the question: is "Lost Highway" really worth the effort to think about? The answer will vary from viewer to viewer, but I happen to think it is, yes.<br/><br/>Undeniably, Lynchwhose fascination with dreamscapes has influenced his work from the very beginningenjoys overlapping chronologies, characters, and even metaphysical space with little (if any) explanation, but the occasional jerkiness of "Lost Highway"'s trajectory smacks of narrative conflict, and some aspects of the plot dead-end in a tangle by the climax. For as many answers that can be extracted out of its 135 minutes, "Lost Highway" raises even more questionsand that is its purpose. It's like a hypnotic trance into where you're lead and evil approaches when you're at your weakest as time and confusion collide and time is lost and evil closes in consuming all that is reality but the consequences of lost time are still real. Did someone do something they didn't remember or was time framed around the collision between the lost gap in time and the nightmare that became reality. Circumstances that occur with memory lapses or a blur between the part of ourselves that is hidden away from others as I'm sure most people have some kind of demons but aren't consumed within them and the fine thread that connects us to our destiny's. This is the kind of thing this movie made me think of. I thought it was pretty clever. But I gotta ask the question ... Wouldn't everyone just love to beat the holy crap out of a rude,obnoxious,honking,inconsiderate tail-gater? "Lost Highway" delivers just what you would expect from Lynch; eerie, almost horror-like, subtle storytelling that we saw in some parts of the Twin Peaks. There's always some paranoia in the air, and nothing is what it seems. The camera-work sometimes reminds me of Kubrick's "Shining", as it flows ghostly forward, almost like spying the main characters. There are many, very dark sequences, but sometimes Lynch throws in some actual comedy-noir, that might seem a little out of place for some.<br/><br/>Also, "Lost Hightway" could be considered as a quite "mature" film, as there's a lot of nudity, violence and other wickedness that's not very suitable for children (that's why it probably received R/18+ ratings almost everywhere). The music is excellent as always, there are some compositions by A. Badalamenti, as well as contributions from such artists as T. Reznor (Nine Inch Nails) and Marilyn Manson, who also did a cameo in the film.<br/><br/>A lot of talk has been about the plot, and how it makes sense. There indeed is a golden string to be followed, but i think the only person who really knows the final solution (as there probably is no such thing) is Lynch himself.<br/><br/>After all, a film way above your average thriller, and shouldn't be considered as such. Lost highway was the 3th movie I watched of David Lynch, a friend told me to watch because it was a way to understand Mulholland Dr., but it isn't really, it's a way to understand the trajectory of Lych's ideas and career. Lost Highway already has a masters in sound FX, making sound and music a different language to guide the mood of the movie, actually, without the personality of Lynch's Music selection and sound FX, his movies would lack a considerable amount of drama content. i'm not blaming the movie to be so hard to understand, Lynch now vision to produce surrealist films had to have a first step, and that was Lost Highway, landing, of course, in Mulholland Dr. Masterpiece. The characters in Lost Highway work like symbols interacting between each other, producing in the audience feeling from their real life. Photograph in this movie works like a percussion in a orchestra, or a drum kit in a band, guiding the rhythm of a song. After you watch it once, it's impossible not to watch it again. David Lynch is a maniac,madly,original,twisted and socking director so hard to understand but genial!!,this movie contains a dose of"Blue Velvet","Wild at Heart", and "Mullholland Drive" in a balanced potion: road movie,darkness,BETRAYAL,rage,erotism,mobsters,anger and more elements only of his own.<br/><br/>About the players:Pullman correct as he uses without shinning,Patty Arquette so talented,sexy,mysterious though she's not pretty,her sister Rossana does,but not to equal Patty,an almost unknown Robert Blake(the opposite to his rude,reckless and maleness"Baretta") looking gay-like(he reminded me Dean Stockwell at "Blue Velvet"),Natasha Gregson good maybe she's still far from her mom Natalie Wood but she's not out of tune,Busey fulfilling OK his duty,the deceased Richard Pryor was the curious note here,a famous comedian appearing in a shadeness,Gothic movie,I left to the end Robert Loggia is an underrated veteran actor so powerful to make villains charged of total coldness,shameless,pure evilness;but i wonder: Why hadn't such extraordinary performer got the enough acknowledge from filmmakers,critics and the movie-goers to take him over the top?.The misled merchandising prefers to promotion talentless beings like Harrelson,Juliette Lewis,Parker Posey and more undesireable bugs only products of the choking advertising,LOGGIA IN ALL HIS LONG CAREER NEVER HAD A GOOD MANAGER LIKE THOSE CRAPPY PUPPETS,regretly that's the great difference. Turning back to this "noir" and strong flick,it could be better if the end had been with Arquette in a more jeopardy,including when Loggia is bleeding,despite of this omission,this movie is a big hit,something so usual in Mr. Lynch. Lost Highway is one of those films that will have you scratching your head for days after every single watch but, being a David Lynch film, this does not come as a great surprise. Lost Highway is an inspired piece of complicated story telling and weird characters. What the film lacks in sense, it makes up for with depth, visual gratification and style. Lynch bases his films on imagery and Lost Highway is very powerful on this front, with full intent to shock and excite the audience. Even for those who are not fans of this genre, Lost Highway is definitely an experience.<br/><br/>As well as having one of the most talented and creative film makers there is, Lost Highway also boasts a very strong cast. Bill Pullman gives a great, almost sedated, performance, parading a great range of jealousy, rage, desperation and love. This is the Bill Pullman we want not President alien killer! Balthazar Getty is a little out of his depth in this film but comes across very well as a passionate, confused character. Patricia Arquette gives the best performance in the film; playing two characters. She is sexual yet lovable, vulnerable but domineering and caring yet selfish. Her role is so challenging and intense but Arquette raises the material with her performance. This is the role that put Arquette in the leading lady category and she's never looked back since. The rest of the cast is a mix of the weird and wonderful, ensuring Lost Highway is packed full of imagination.<br/><br/>This film is the pinnacle of David Lynch's career and it is amazing that after Blue Velvet and Wild at Heart that Lynch has managed to keep being so creative. No one can match Lynch on imagination and visual flair, not even Terry Gilliam or David Cronenberg, and it is these elements that give Lost Highway that something special. Lost Highway does suffer from being a little over confusing and it is questionable whether it is possible to understand this film at all but it really doesn't matter. The plot manipulation is second to none and ensures the audience is never comfortable, exactly how Lynch planned it. Lynch is notorious for making dark films and they don't come much darker than this. Lost Highway is definitely not for the faint hearted and goes to great efforts to explore voyeurism, jealousy, power and the grotesque.<br/><br/>One of the truly great films, Lost Highway is an explosion on the eyes and brain that is so powerful, that it overcomes confusion. There is a strong theme about the walls of reality closing in, and I like that very much. By far, David Lynch's best film, one of the films of the 90s. As David Foster Wallace has noted, Lynch has always been much better at getting past the viewer's defenses and into the viewer's head than he is at telling a cohesive, satisfying story once he's in there. "Twin Peaks" is the prime example of this weakness...the series invoked so many enigmas, mysteries, and disturbing questions in its opening episodes and in its 'middle acts' that the audience was agog to find out how it all 'ended'...only to discover that Lynch didn't really know how to end it, and so the whole thing trailed off with an unconvincing fizzle. <br/><br/>However, in his recent films, Lynch and his collaborators seem to have overcome this problem by presenting their stories as an objectification of a disturbed mind's subjective fears and desires. In other words, SOMETHING in the "real world" has happened to affect the protagonist, but what that something is almost impossible to say...and in fact it is often almost impossible to tell who the protagonist is. Someone is crazy here, but who? <br/><br/>So the brilliance of "Lost Highway" is in the way that this approach plays to Lynch's strengths as a story teller. The themes of alienation in the relationship or the marriage, of sexual discontent and longing, of infidelity, of threatened violence and actual murder...they keep recurring in both of the main characters' lives. But the viewer knows something is wrong, because the majority of events in the plot range from odd and disturbing - to highly improbable - to simply impossible in the 'normal' physical world. So it becomes obvious that the plot is following horrid dream logic, but the question is, whose dream is it, and why this particular dream? <br/><br/>By building the story this way, by refusing to explicitly answer that question, and by never actually explicitly mentioning that denial, illusion, mental illness, hallucination or false memories could be a factor (unlike the recent "Hellraiser" sequels, "Jacob's Ladder" or "Sixth Sense") "Lost Highway" takes the story into the nightmare realm of the most glumly mystical Kafka stories such as "Metamorphosis" or "The Trial". In this mode of story telling, Lynch doesn't HAVE to resolve the story, he just has to be clever and sensitive enough to immerse the viewer in the circular logic and magical thinking of a disturbed mind in a fugue state. And he does that here with all his usual panache. <br/><br/>The actual execution of the film is just what fans have come to expect and love about Lynch's work. You could even call it "pure golden Lynch". Robert Loggia and Robert Blake are superb in their roles, embodying menace and creepiness in ways few actors can hope to equal. Bill Pullman also gives the performance of his career here (too bad it didn't do his career more good). The soundtrack, the costumes, the sets (especially Pullman/"Fred's" apartment), the photography...everything comes together to pull the viewer into a narcoleptic fog of smoldering desire, hopelessness, muted fear and alienation. I assume that's what viewers of Lynch's films are after, anyway. <br/><br/>I have to admit, this one turned me into a fan. But I should qualify that admission in one way. I saw "Mullholland Drive" before I saw this ,and MH may have helped condition my perceptions and taste for this kind of story. <br/><br/>Lynch fans will love it. Polanski, Fellini, and Kurasawa fans will probably love it too. Movie goers who think that the sun rises and sets on Micheal Bay...maybe not so much. Someone is sending Fred and his wife Renee videotapes of inside their house. Fred then sees a tape where he kills Renee, and is arrested and sentenced to death. But he disappears from his cell and is replaced by Pete, a young auto-mechanic. Pete is released and starts having an affair with Alice, the mistress of a local mobster. Alice looks identical to Renee, and reveals that she was once a starlet in the mobster's porno film racket. Pete and Alice elope to the desert, where Alice disappears and Pete turns back into Fred. Fred finds the mobster in a motel with Renee (apparently alive), takes him out to the desert and kills him. After that, things get a bit strange ...<br/><br/>The plot summary above doesn't really begin to do justice to Lost Highway, which is spooky, confusing, extremely stylish and a lot of fun. I don't really think I understood the story but I'm pretty sure I wasn't really supposed to either - once you get rid of cinema conventions like someone can only be in one place at a time, there's a lot of creative enjoyment to be had messing with both the characters and the audience. It's a great fever dream of a film (like Performance or Fitzcarraldo), where the slightly surreal ambiance creates a hypnotic echoing effect that sucks you into the movie. It's also a fabulous cinematic treatment, almost an exercise in clever and rarely-used techniques - daringly underexposed and overexposed shots, grainy video footage, image mosaics, reversed scenes, etc, all accompanied by stunning sound design which frequently crashes from whispered dialogue into deafening music cues. The cast have great fun with their roles, particularly Arquette (frequently in some state of undress), Loggia as the nasty gangster and Blake as the truly bizarre Mystery Man. My only criticism of this movie is the ending, which is okay, but doesn't really begin to answer any of the questions (are Fred and Pete one and the same, are Renee and Alice one and the same, who sends the videotapes, does Fred die, does Renee die, and most importantly, why is anyone doing what they are doing). A mystifying but marvellous picture from the unique David Lynch. And remember - never tailgate Robert Loggia ! as with all of David lynch's films if you try to work out the ins and outs of this film it would be like finding out the meaning of life it will leave you with nothing to enjoy. The main thing that jumps out at me from this film is the soundtrack with tracks by Marilyn Manson,Trent Reznor(nine inch nails),Rammstein and the Smashing pumpkins. even a small cameo from Manson and Twiggy (mason's bassist) although I'm not a fan of Ranson or Rammstein i felt that the music in this film gave it that extra head mess atmosphere. story and music aside the list of cameos is amazing with Richard Pryor,Henry Rollins and Giovanni Rissibi to name but a few. all in all this film is a must see for all fans of Lynch. hopefully more directors will follow in the foot steps of lynch and Gus Van Sant and make more films for indie audiences and mainstream alike p.s. look out for Darren Doane To start with, anybody who thinks LH is too slow has been spoil by too many Hollywood flicks designed for the masses. By European standards, it is not slow at all. If you ever listened to 'Phase patterns' by Steve Reich, you've heard four organs playing patterns and then getting out of control until they all interact and all you can hear is harmonics; listen to it with some friends and you'll see that nobody hears the same melody. This movie does the exact same thing. The whole fun of it is to check out what other people saw and/or understood. Here's what I think I understood after three viewings (in the light of Mulholland Drive which is very similar): the whole movie is a flashback. On the verge of dying in the Chair, Fred relives his whole life. But he sees it as he remembers it, not how it actually happened (he says it himself). That is why it starts with 'Dick Laurent is dead' although he is not dead yet; he knows he will die because he's already lived the story. He changes all sorts of things, starting with himself. Instead of an older sexually inadequate murderer, he is a young, virile and innocent man. But reality haunts him (like in MD), in the form of the Mystery Man - Evil - who tells him that when you're sentenced to death, you cannot escape (reality). You have to accept that Evil can take the form of an actual man (like Bob in Twin Peaks). Which is why when Fred disappears into the dark side of his house (of himself), he reappears as two men (there are two shadows), one kills his wife, the other one puts it on film (his memory?). Or maybe Pete is really a younger Fred - everything in the second part of the movie seems less 90's looking than the first half. Except the music... But while Pete is dancing with Sheila in the dance hall, the music is fast, but everybody's dancing a slow, so he's changed the music in his mind. Or wait, maybe... Damn, let's face it, I didn't understand anything about this movie. Yet I've enjoyed it. Which is what makes it so great. I liked Mulholland Drive better because it actually makes sense if you try hard enough, but I really liked LH, it's like a first draft of MD. First and foremost, i would like to denounce all David Lynch fans who claim to understand his movies. It is one thing to understand the man himself, but the claim of completely understanding a movie like Lost Highway, is plain charlatanism.<br/><br/>David Lynch is one of the most important directors of modern time, because he is probably the only one who can claim to really be thinking "outside the box". As you watch his films, the really strange ones or those that can be interpreted in different ways, Mr. Lynch, makes you _think_.<br/><br/>Watching modern Hollywood productions today does not necessitate using your brain at all. Everything is distressingly obvious and plain.<br/><br/>And then you have movies like this one. Lost Highway. A movie where you have to draw conclusions, and really ponder over what has happened, and again... go outside the box. <br/><br/>Saying this, i do not claim his movies are absolute masterpieces. Lost Highway has an eerie feeling to it, but i question his choice of actors though. Pullman was never great. But Blake, on the other hand, makes for a bloodcurdling Mystery Man.<br/><br/>Having said this, there is not much left to say about the movie per say. But what he is doing to you, while you are watching his films, is more important than the films themselves. And that, makes David Lynch, one of the greatest directors of modern cinema. Well we sat some guys and voted for what film to see, and none of us had seen Lost Highway - it's Lynch so it ought to be good.<br/><br/>And while one of us was about to fall a sleep during the movie, I and another thought it was great.<br/><br/>It's spectacular and it makes you want to solve the puzzle, trying to understand the characters and the universe, in which this movie tells its story. All of this to try and find out, what is happening here?<br/><br/>It's really hard putting words to, how strong the urge to solve the mystery is, and how fascinated you get of the characters. The characters are spectacular, you either feel with them or love to hate them.<br/><br/>The headline is, if you like Lynch, you will find this movie interesting. I just want to say that this movie is not so strange as everybody says. The only problem is, you probably gotta see this movie twice to understand it. But that wasn't a problem for me. Once you understand this movie, it's GREAT! the plot is superb. It's kinda like mulholland drive, a bit more complicated maybe.<br/><br/>There are, like in every lynch film, great characters. Each character has some great habbits. Therefor, i liked the characters more, cause they where well, sort of recognizable (is that a word?).<br/><br/>Anyway, a MUST for every lynch fan, every mystery fan, and what the heck, everybody who expects a nice twist/complication.<br/><br/>I rated it 9/10. This always looked like an interesting and weird film, so when it came on the sci-fi network I decided to give it a try, and I was not disappointed. I have seen most of David Lynch's other films, and this was probably the most entertaining. It starts out really creepy, and when it gets going, its an edge of your seat ride. If you enjoyed films like "Dark City"(1998), or even stuff like "Videodrome"(1983),this is probably right up your alley. But I know some people will hate it. I'll give it *** out of ****, or 8/10, because it did have quite a few flaws, but otherwise it was well worth a watch........................................ I intentionally missed LHW on the big screen because at the time of its release I was not a David Lynch fan and although the trailer was intriguing, the film seemed too weird for my tastes.<br/><br/>Over the years my mind has broadened and I now consider Lynch to be a genius. I found LHW on DVD recently in a local shop for $20 (Australian) and bought it because I suspected I'd want to watch the film at least twice. After viewing LHW the other week for the very first time, I know I will be watching the film again and again because it is a masterpiece of horror, paranoia and bizarreness. Purchasing LHW for $20 was an absolute bargain in my opinion! <br/><br/>Lynch creates mysteries which may be difficult to comprehend, but are so beautifully surreal and brilliantly compelling that whether or not you get the story doesn't really matter. He creates scenes, dialogue and visuals which linger in the mind for weeks and months afterwards.<br/><br/>Of course, Lynch's work is not to everyone's tastes so it's certainly okay to dislike LHW. It is a film where the plot and story jump between different realities and later, different realities start to clash together  weird, weird stuff. It's definitely not `big bucket of pop-corn with extra butter' entertainment.<br/><br/>Interestingly, I viewed LHW with a friend who is 15 years older and twice as intelligent as me. He actually doesn't really care for Lynch films because he believes that Lynch uses a lot of style, character and plot tricks to cover up rather mundane stories. In regards to the story of LHW, after the credits rolled he stated that the plot and story were actually very simplistic. He gave me his interpretation of the story which he said revolved around schizophrenia.<br/><br/>I asked my friend about specific characters and specific events in the film (some of which went totally over my head), and he gave me logical and plausible explanations which I found both fascinating and disappointing at the same time. Why disappointing? Because one of the main reasons I love Lynch films is the fact that they are so mysterious and leave a lot of questions running around in my brain afterwards  the same way events in my life and the world in general do.<br/><br/>9/10 This movie is great. Very creative dark story telling. Another great Lynch movie with unique imagery. It also has a thought provoking time-line of events and character switching that will trip you out and force you to analyze what you saw, what/who was real & what really happened. The mood is dark, eerie & suspenseful. Not many movies give you such an experience as this one. <br/><br/> This movie doesn't get as high of praise as Lynch's Mulholland Dr. but they are actually pretty similar. I recommend them both if you've only seen one or the other. I will agree though. Mulholland Dr. is more of a cinematic masterpiece. <br/><br/> 8/10...maybe 9/10 ? Beautiful, perfect movie. A 21st Century film-noir, the greatest of all Lynch´s films. Visually beautiful, this film gives us Lynch at it´s best. No headache, no paranoia. It includes one of all time´s most wonderfully sinister characters, Mystery Man. Excellent dialogues, excellent scenes, great music, and (what most of Lynch´s films don´t have), excellent taste. What should be the essence of a true good movie (let´s leave behind the ones that only look for the entertainment of the audience; we´re talking about art here)? To tell a story? to tell something?<br/><br/>The essence of a movie lies on the expression of art that it can transmit. If you think that telling a story is the most important thing on a movie, then you just don´t love art for what it really is. You´re ignoring almost a century of the surreal cinema begun by Buñuel and Dalí.<br/><br/>
As in other artistic manifestations such as painting, cinema just can´t be enclosed in the limits and boundaries of reason. The author must have liberty to express himself using, in this case, the movie as his media.<br/><br/>
Lost Highway is a movie made by a genius of modern cinema, David Lynch, and those who complain for not understanding his movies, shouldn´t worry so much.And they definitely shouldn´t criticize mr. Lynch´s work with that parameter. If you want, criticize the way he made the movie, i mean, the shots, and specially it is important to notice if the author achieved his goal.<br/><br/>In Lost Highway, just as in the other David Lynch´s movies, the director keeps on working and goes even deeper in what has been the main topic of his career: the development of mysteries.<br/><br/>Lynch wants the audience to get surprised and to get involved with the mysteries he creates. He has said that it doesn´t matter if they are solved or not, because what is really important is the progression and confusion that mysteries can achieve. In fact, it is better for the audience not to get the solutions of the problems, because in that way, the movie will get them , they will feel confused and they will try to get their own conclusions. In other words, you will have to think.<br/><br/>In that sense, Lost Highway succeeds, it is a very dark and mysterious piece which will make you think. Many great sequences and bizarre characters, all accompanied by heavy music.<br/><br/>By the way, Robert Blake´s character is just incredible.<br/><br/>Simply perfect, what else can i say.<br/><br/>Your imagination did it again mr. Lynch. While watching this film, I couldn't help but to think of the similarities that this movie has from Mulholland Dr and Blue Velvet.  The whole idea of a dream reality from Mulholland Dr. and the personification of pure evil from Blue Velvet, were all there. Nevertheless it has its own uniqueness that made it stand alone from the rest.  The movie itself wasn't bad as many people think but on the other hand the movie is not for everybody either. Not everyone has the same taste, but you will never know if you like Lynch's movies until you see one of his classics.  Nothing is more fun than to put the pieces together from a Lynch's movie after you have seem it, and this one is not difference from the other ones. But I'll say this, if you are ever looking for a movie that will turn the world upside down from its own reality, there is nobody that does it better than Lynch. Lost Highway is not simply a movie, it's a whole new world David Lynch had created hoping that most of the spectators of this will get into it and feel as psychotic as the main hero (Bill Pulman). Maybe you won't understand a thing, don't try to if you don't, just let the magic atmosphere of this masterpiece flow into you... WARNING: Spoilers!!!<br/><br/>David Lynch has demonstrated time and time again his mastery of mixing in identifiable iconography with obscure surrealist imagery and plot devices. Here with "Lost Highway," he does it yet again. "Lost Highway" is probably his biggest headaches you'll ever experience. Nothing about this film is simple or easily understood, which is typical of Lynch, but while "Twin Peaks," "Blue Velvet," or "Wild at Heart" are mildly comprehensible (I don't include "Eraserhead" because it seems obvious right from the beginning that that film was supposed to be more art than story), "Lost Highway" will literally require multiple viewings to even catch a glimmer of what is supposed to be going on.<br/><br/>First of all, the plot...at least as best as I can make out. Fred Madison (Bill Pullman in one of his most divergent performances) is a jazz musician who has suspicions that his wife Renee (Patricia Arquette) may be cheating on him. His suspicions are not aided by a series of mysterious videotapes being left at his door, showing him and his wife sleeping. After a strange encounter with a hideous pale man (Robert Blake at his scariest), he finds another videotape that shows him murdering his wife, and he is sent to deathrow. While in prison, somehow he disappears and becomes the much younger Pete Dayton (Balthazar Getty). Pete's life is one of no complaints. He lives with his parents, he has a steady job as a mechanic, and he has a pretty girlfriend, and he gets sex whenever he wants. And then Mr. Eddy shows up (Robert Loggia), one of Pete's regulars, and a mob boss whose girlfriend Alice (Patricia Arquette...again) looks like a blond version of Fred's wife. He has an affair with her, and things start to unravel...<br/><br/>Sound complicated? It should...because while it may take multiple viewings to piece together the nature of the plot, it seems easy to figure out that this film does not take place in the real world, but rather a translucent celluloid version of it. It looks like Los Angeles, but they never actually explicitly say that it is (despite one instance of an L.A.P.D. sign). From this, we can assume that the whole movie is a dream or fantasy...again, typical of Lynch. But whose fantasy? Fred's most likely...things start out somewhat normal, but they go bad very quick from a series of odd occurances (the videotapes, the strange man, and a strange unseen visitor who delivers an eerie message in the beginning of the film). When things are at their bleakest, he is replaced by Pete Dayton, who suffers s similar turn of events, although completely different...but it does seem clear that both suffer their downfall because of Renee/Alice. Are Renee and Alice the same person? Are Fred and Pete the same person? Is the man in black real or is he representative of something evil (well of course, but whose evil)? Ultimately, the answers are not so clearcut, and the film leaves the viewer with enough clues to figure out their own explanation, but still never be satisfied with it.<br/><br/>Lynch once said that this film takes place in the same world as "Twin Peaks," and in some ways it's easy to see how. The fact that Renee is brunette and Alice is blond mirrors Sheryl Lee's characters of the blond Laura and the brunette Maddy in "Twin Peaks," the whole nature of Robert Blake's character reminds us of Killer Bob, though Blake's character's motivations are slightly more obscure. And while this may be a trivial comparison, the story starts with one pair of detectives, and introduces a second pair later...eventually bringing the two together, not unlike the FBI agents in "Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me." The references to "Wild at Heart" are also rampant, but this is perhaps due to Barry Gifford's cowriting credit. The black car, the character of Andy (who resembles Willem Dafoe's character in "Wild at Heart"), one could have a field day comparing the imagery of this film to that of other Lynch films.<br/><br/>After all is said and done, "Lost Highway" is a film that will mess with your sensibilities and leave you wondering what the hell is going on, doing a complete 360 just when you think you've figured it out. It is not a film for all audiences...not because of its content, which is no more violent or sex-ridden than any other Hollywood offering...what makes it a difficult film to watch is its very avant-garde nature, the lack of anything really explicit in the story or the characters. Be ready to think, and be ready to have your brain hurt when you watch this film. ***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** "Lost Highway" is not for everyone.  No movie ever is.  However, for a film that is often said to have no coherent organization, or a rather senseless organization aimed primarily at weirdness for its own sake, "Lost Highway" is really quite systematic.  It's just that it is systematic in an incredibly innovative way.  At first, it might all seem random and jumbled, and the interactions might seem trivial, but once you figure out how the film works, everything falls into place and resonates with meaning.<br/><br/>(Spoilers)<br/><br/>The film unfolds the inner workings of Fred's fears and fantasies regarding his wife Renee.  Fred fears that Renee does not want him, that he does not satisfy her, and that she is cheating on him.  Fred wants to possess Renee. Fred's fantasies and fears are full of contradictions, but here's how they play out: Fred murders Renee; he's her virile lover and she can't get enough of him (portrayed through Pete and Alice); she's possessed by another man (Mr. Eddy) and she's a whore (as depicted through her relationship to Andy, the pornographic filmmaker); he catches her with another man and kills him, twice (first Andy, then Mr. Eddy/Dick Laurent); she eludes his possession ("I want you Alice."/"You'll never have me.").<br/><br/>The film develops by means of the carefully orchestrated repetition and reconfiguration of thematic elements.  After revealing Fred's murderous desire to possess Renee, the film introduces doubles while inverting key characteristics: Fred's an inadequate lover, Pete's a virile lover; Renee is unsatisfied, Alice is insatiable.  Through the doubles, implicit themes and dynamics are made explicit: she's possessed by another man; she's a whore; he's threatened by the possessive 'other man' (literally, with a gun); he kills the man she's whoring herself with (Andy).  The character inversions are then exposed as lies driven by the truth that she eludes his possession ("You'll never have me."; "Her name is Renee!"; "And your name?."). Reintroducing the original characters, the concluding section replays and 'resolves' the plot's development: Renee is with the possessive 'other man' (Mr. Eddy/Laurent); she's a whore (notice Renee in the porn clips); Fred murders Laurent while wearing his counterpart's virile clothes (Fred wears Pete's motorcycle jacket throughout the concluding section of the film). At the same time, the concluding section illustrates the contradictory outcomes of parts one and two of the film: he has murdered her; she has eluded his possessive grasp.<br/><br/>Far from being an unorganized or muddled mass of nonsense, "Lost Highway" skillfully repeats, reconfigures, and develops its themes in much the same way that a musical composition does, complete with three main sections: exposition, development, and recapitulation.  But the genius of the film is in the details.  Pay very close attention to the way that images, music, and elements of the story are repeated.  I'll give two examples.<br/><br/>
First example: Alice tells Pete about meeting Andy, just as Renee told Fred: "I met him at a place called Moke's. We became friends.  He told me about a job."  When Fred rather pointedly asks "What job," Renee's somewhat delayed response is: "I don't remember."  The second time around, Fred's fears about Renee--namely, that she's a whore--are played out, to the *extreme*, through Alice's description of stripping at gunpoint and Pete's disgusted reaction ("You liked it, huh?").  However, Alice is still able to seduce Pete, despite his whorish image of her--themes that will be taken up again at Andy's house and in the final scene between Pete and Alice (at the cabin).<br/><br/>Second example: Fred's explosive and virile sax performance, which Renee shows no interest in (supposedly she stayed home to read, but no one answers when Fred calls home), is repeated twice.  Images of Fred playing sax are replayed *without the sound* as Fred remembers Renee leaving one of his performances with another man (Andy).  Things have become more explicit: Renee is shown with another man, and Fred's sax playing has been deprived of its potency.  Immediately after this memory sequence, Fred and Renee have sex, and Fred's sexual performance leaves Renee unsatisfied and cold, which in turn provokes Fred's response of anxiety and revulsion.  Later in the film, immediately after Pete and Sheila have passionate sex, the audio from the sax solo plays over the radio at Arnie's garage, and Pete, disturbed by the music, changes the station.  Pete doesn't need a substitute for sexual virility, but on the other hand, Pete *is* a virile substitute--for Fred. The return of the audio plays on the contradictions of Pete's dual status as virile lover and virile substitute.<br/><br/>These are just two examples.  The film contains dozens of meaningfully organized repetitions and juxtapositions.  That is how it tells its story.<br/><br/>One point deserves some clarification.  A lot of confusion revolves around the following question: does Fred turn into Pete, or is that just in his head?  The film intentionally allows both interpretations, so don't rack your brain trying to figure out which interpretation is the right one. Just pick one and stick with it for the duration of the film.  But unless you want to adventure into a plot that violates the law of non-contradiction (with the reintroduction of Renee after her murder), I recommend the "it's just in his head" interpretation.  On the other hand, it is by following "Lost Highway" into the plot of open contradictions, where contradictory fears and fantasies come to their realization, that the film offers its boldest and, in some ways, most remarkable innovations.  Try the film both ways, but not simultaneously.<br/><br/>As for the Mystery Man. what is his role in all this?  I'll leave that question open to your interpretation.<br/><br/>Along with its neo-noir beauty and its powerfully atmospheric score, "Lost Highway" combines an innovative use of sound and image with a groundbreaking plot that develops by means of ingeniously organized repetitions and doublings.  Easily the most innovative and masterful film of the 90s, "Lost Highway" sets new standards for what can be achieved through the medium of film: 10/10. Though full of the great, incredibly creepy, atmospherics David Lynch viewers have come to expect "Lost Highway" was painfully slow at times during the first hour or so of the film. Fortunately, at that point Robert Loggia and Eric Chavez (Golden Glove third baseman for the Oakland A's) come along and really put the movie into gear, making the rest of the film thoroughly enjoyable. We see lots of Lynch's familiar motifs - stuff catching on fire, red velvet drapes contrasted with flashes of blue light, the non-linear structure he would later use in "Mulholland Drive." Also among these these motifs we see here is the use of one incredibly creepy dude (here played superbly by Robert Blake, in the tradition of Dennis Hopper in "Blue Velvet" and that troll hanging out behind Denny's, I mean Winkie's, in "Mulholland Drive.")<br/><br/>For me, "Lost Highway" really feels not so much of a great movie itself as an interesting evolutionary point in David Lynch's moviemaking on the way to his masterpiece, "Mulholland Drive."  It's definitely worth seeing if you're already a big Lynch fan; if you're just looking for something of his to watch, you'd be better off with "Blue Velvet," "Wild at Heart" or "Mulholland Drive." Film art, and pure Lynch.  Some beautiful cinematography, construction of the scenes, help build the mood.  The mood is characteristic Lynch: dark and quiet, punctuated by the horrible (and at times amusingly grotesque). Also typical of Lynch, the story leaves one full of unanswered questions, but perhaps even more so here than in other works like Wild at Heart and Blue Velvet.  There is something of an identity confusion: two men, each with their own lives, are somehow actually only one.  There are other surreal elements mixed in with the real, and no clear indications where the division is, nor whether the surreal is external or internal to some character (or from whom).  The resolution of this confusion is left to the viewer. I'm not a big fan of Lynch movies; far too much of his work seems weird for the sake of being weird, with no real justification. Lost Highway, though, is a flawed masterpiece, the best attempt yet at a completely non-linear plot in a major movie. Discussing it without spoilers is hard, but I'll try not to give away anything too specific.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with Lost Highway is that it starts so slowly and with such bizarre performances; there are good reasons for this, but today we're spoon-fed so many stupid blockbusters where everything is explained so that even a two-year-old could understand, and we've forgotten that some movies actually expect a little thought on the part of the audience.<br/><br/>Most people who watch it think 'well, this is just another good-looking pointless Lynch movie with no plot'. A character changes completely in the middle of the movie, and that can't mean anything, it's just weird. A man pistol-whips a tailgater, that's weird, but it can't mean anything. All kinds of weird things happen... but they can't mean anything, they're just weird. The back-cover blurb on my video copy must be the most Clintonesque ever written; it's a precisely accurate description of what happens on screen, yet tells you almost nothing important.<br/><br/>Once you get beyond that point and accept that the movie does have a plot, it's pretty easy to follow. The key occurs early on, when Fred talks about his hatred of video cameras: "I like to remember things my own way. How I remembered them, not necessarily the way they happened." Almost the entire movie exists entirely inside his head, only the videotapes are objectively real; everything else is his memories, remembered the way he wanted to remember them. He tries to avoid his fate by imagining himself as someone completely different, but no matter how hard he tries, his past comes back to haunt him. The rest of the weirdness is telling the audience one thing: this is not real; but follow the links between the different imagined events and the reality behind them soon becomes clear.<br/><br/>Oddly, most of the movie-makers I know understood it straight away, and most of the movie-watchers thought it was just weird. Certainly this movie should be required viewing for anyone in the creative side of the movie business simply because it shows how much more we can do with the film medium; Joyce utterly destroyed the necessity of linear plots in literature decades ago, it's about time movies caught up.<br/><br/>(And if you don't believe me, go read some of Barry Gifford's interviews). Lost Highway fits into a unique genre of movies called 'Love 'em or hate 'em' It doesn't really matter whether or not you understand 'it', the sequences or the images in encloses, it's how it makes you feel, and in the case of this film, really deep down. This is a film about emotions and reaches out to your senses both conscious and subconscious. This film is brilliant for the things that you can and can't understand. This film deserves a 10 for being different alone and not pandering to the masses. It is quite difficult to rationally describe this movie. We are greeted by an appropriate song from David Bowie and the headlights shining on the road, and then the Fred Madison character and the puzzling comment on the intercom, which intrigues us throughout. I think it is an exploration of our characters and sometimes feeling like another person. But it is an enjoyable film. The acting is superb. Robert Blake as the eerie Mystery Man is a baffling conundrum. There are parts which can't be explained, but that's what makes this all perplexing and makes it work. That's the point of it. It can't be analysed. It is a delve into Fred's split and confused mind, and the contents are not for everyone. But for the others they are rewarding. This is my favorite movie. Lynch is able to let the characters relive my deepest fears on screen. His sounds & Visions are surrounding me for more than 2 hours. It is a ride. It is confusing but it makes a terrible sense to me in a very personal way. This is more than I could ask for from cinema at all. It is a mirror, it is a nightmare. It is beautíful und awful at the same time. It means a lot to me. Loving this movie could be something pretty personal, while hating this movie could be because you didn´t have interest to get much more than confused. Love you, Mr. Lynch. Thanks for this movie, it moved me more than anything before. A unique movie experience. You will live intensely every second of it. Just a small objection which made me put a 9 instead of 10: Although its purpose is not to follow the usual scenario guidelines, it sometimes prefers the easy way and leaves too many unanswered questions. It could be just a bit more consistent, but still it is truly amazing to watch. Lost Highway is a difficult film. For some of us, this is a glorious thing- if you were blown away by the final segment of Kubrick's 2001, then this is definitely a film for you. Unfortunately for many, we get hung up on structure and detail. I know nothing bores me more than a film that falls into a formula or a stereotype like so many films today do. I know for a lot of people, we find a certain level of comfort in being able to foresee the outcome in a story. If they leave thinking "What the...?!" they feel robbed and insulted. For many, this is the downfall of Lost Highway. Ultimately, some will hate this film, there is really no way around that. Know this, if you have yet to see this film, there is a plot, but the loose ends do not tie up nicely. Let it go. Drown yourself in the wonderfully horrible environment Lynch has given us and enjoy the film for what it is. Then maybe you can love this movie as much as I do. Otherwise, just go rent Die Hard again. I consider myself a pretty big David Lynch fan, but this movie really left me in the dark.  The gratuitous sex scenes were a little too much. For someone to acctually write the plot about this movie you would of had to of seen it at least 3 or 4 times. The movie is a very random circumstance movie. The first time I saw it, I was like, that was awesome, don't know what it's about, but awesome. If your gonna watch this movie, this is a movie you want to sit down, not talk to anyone, and give 100% attention to. Because if you don't, you'll just sit there and go, "huh" the whole time. Highly suggested to watch! "Art should allay the fiction of order."<br/><br/>-Steve Schieberl<br/><br/>David Lynch has done just that.<br/><br/>A man denies reality, and does not adhere to consequence.  He creates his own reality... inviting danger into his life.  He tries to control a woman with a wild spirit.<br/><br/>'Lost Highway' takes you out of your seat and into a world where time and space are completely out of control.  David Lynch presents us with the story's clues, and leaves it to the audience to make sense of it.  In essence, it is a painting without words... it has definite reason, but is left open for interpretation.<br/><br/>David Lynch gives us a mystery, not a mystery movie.<br/><br/>For one of, if not THE, most incredible films ever made, 'Lost Highway' is a HIGHLY recommended view.<br/><br/>NOTE: I believe I've cracked the 'Lost Highway' mystery.  > 'Lost Highway' is not for the faint of brain.  Your friends might say 'Lost Highway' requires no brain, but they simply aren't using theirs. ;o) Get this:  Jennifer Lynch made a movie called Boxing Helena.  It was bad. The basic premise was this:  A guy falls in love with an unattainable woman. When she doesn't return his affection, he cuts off her arms and legs to gain control over her.  But, (surprise!) she still doesn't love him. Next, David Lynch (Jennifer's dad) makes a film called Lost Highway.  It was good.  The basic premise is this:  Fred falls in love with Renee(Patricia Arquette).  She doesn't quite love him, and she may or may not be cheating on him.  Fred(Bill Pullman) gets jealous and kills her.  Now, he's in jail, wishing he had done everything differently.  But the Mystery Man(Robert Blake) has just what he needs:  a second chance.  When the jailers check his cell, he's no longer Fred, He's Pete(Balthazar Getty).  Pete meets Alice(Patricia Arquette again), and they fall in lust.  It's a better relationship, but Mr. Eddy controls Alice, and he doesn't want Pete in the picture.  That's when things get really strange.<br/><br/>I couldn't give the movie a perfect score, because there was a little too much sex for my tastes, but I understand how important it was to the movie. But the humor and violence are unmistakably Lynch, and if this is his way of saying:  "Here's how it's done, Jennifer," then I thank him, because he's also given us a great film, in some aspects better than Blue Velvet. In my eyes Lost Highway is one of the best movies ever. The reason is that it is entertaining on the one hand, but also subtle on the other hand.<br/><br/>If you know other movies of mastermind David Lynch, you won't be surprised about the strange story which seems to be senseless at the first view. When I first watched the movie, I was absolutely fascinated. I was so excited about how everything is explained at the end, but the end only gives a short clue and no explanation. So during the first watch the movie creates an unbearable tension.<br/><br/>This is also supported by Lynch's brilliant Direction. The majority of the story is only told by images and not by dialogues. Especially in the first about 40 minutes nearly nobody is speaking. Although the movie creates a intense, dark atmosphere, which let's you feel the upcoming menace.<br/><br/>After the first part the movie continues a little bit more usual, there are more dialogues and the whole setting is brighter. But in the end the mood and the kind of story telling of the beginning returns, and this time it's even more intense.<br/><br/>This was the first level the second level is the interpretation. There are lots of proper interpretations for the movie and I think David Lynch won't make a movie without a message to enkrypt. So after watching the movie for the first time, you can watch it again a few times maybe with a friend to talk about possible interpretations. In my eyes this is as much fun as enjoy the film for the first time. Now you can see how subtle this movie really is.<br/><br/>These points make the movie a brilliant artfull masterpiece, which is set in the right mood by director David Lynch and his proper cast. Having been enchanted by "Mulholland Drive", I decided to take a look at one of its predecessors, "Lost Highway". And although it is not as strong as "Mulholland Drive", Lynch's 1997 opus also well deserves the highest rating.<br/><br/> Even if you don't know anything about psychogenic figues or Moebius strips, the first 30 minutes of the film will pull you into Lynch's extraordinary world. But the story of murderous jealousy - as fascinating in itself as it may be - is only the start of a more than disquieting film experience.<br/><br/>The trip into a murderer's head that Lynch takes us on unfolds with a nagging set of repetitious appearances of themes, quotes and characters that can not be resolved by any viewer. On the surface more things in "Lost Highway" remain a mystery than are solved, but that's not just the way David Lynch likes it, but it's the way it should be - or are you always tying up all the knots in your fantasies?<br/><br/>To be brief: brilliant acting (especially by Arquette), perfect suspense, beautiful pictures, no solution - another puzzle without a definite picture by David Lynch and: a great movie. Great characters. Frightening and curious situations. Amazing score and soundtrack. A fantastic movie and yet you have no idea of what's going on. Only a genius can provide that. His name is David Lynch. Lost Highway.... Lost direction.... Lost the will to live.... Whoever said Lynch movies would feel like a dream, was right, when it is about "Lost highway". It is a deep dream. As logical and understandable a dream can be. Best Lynch movie. Becomes an addiction. Cult movie. Thanks, Mr. Lynch. David Lynch´s movies are not for all viewers and Lost Highway is especially not for everybody. It is ´´opera aperta´´ which means that it is an open piece of art and that anybody can find their own meaning or comprehension. Therefore don´t try to understand director´s intention. Lost Highway is about parallel worlds, human conscience, nightmares, ejaculatio praecox and infidelity, accident and predestination, jealousy and paranoia, etc. There are too many other things you can find in this film. Excellent camera work, great performances by an excellent cast, extremely attractive Patricia Arquette /I wish I was Balthazar Getty/, great Angelo Badalamenti score, and of course David Lynch´s direction make it definitely a masterpiece worth seeing anytime. I´ve been through this violent cinematic orgasm about seven times and I still love it! My valuation is 10 out of 10 without any discussion. I can´t wait to see Mulholland Drive. If you like really really strange films that don't make sense and leave you completely baffled by the time the credits roll, you'll love this one. Personally, I didn't like it although I must say it had a brillant soundtrack. It's an amazing and weird movie. Of course I couldn't get the message. What's the point of the movie? What was David Lynch trying to say? I couldn't miss any shot. Though, I had a nightmare after watching it. The movie put you in a loop. The end of the movie is just its beginning. What does that mean? Lost Highway is the most mysterious film I've ever seen. David Bowie's song is great. It's a great deranged movie! The most weird thing about LH is that You feel uncomfortable watching it, in fact it makes you nervous, but you can not move. You keep watching it avidly. This is David Lynch's second best flim, after Blue Velvet. Here Lych creates a world of the real, and unreal. All reflecting in the words of Fred Madision (Bill Pullman) "I like to remember things in my own way."<br/><br/>Lynch has created a surreal nightmare, that really creeps. The performance of Robert Blake as the Mystery Man, takes that uneasy, sickening feeling of something that is not right to a new height. Lynch's use of visuals here is a winner. For some people, it may be a tad slow, however be PATIENT. What is being witnessed on screen is a individuals mental break-down. Quite a scary site.<br/><br/>Lynch has a first rate cast in Pullman, Arquette, Blake, Loggia, and cameos from Pryor and Nance. Screenwriter Lynch and Barry Gifford have created a world that is simply terrifying, in it's exploration. <br/><br/>What else, oh yes!, David Lynch has also complied a top-notch soundtrack, (the majority of it not to my taste.)"I am Deranged", sums up this extrodinary, dare I say art-house flim. Despite being commercially released. In my 21 years I have not come across something so profound, and intrieging as this, see it.<br/><br/>9/10 It's the greatest film ever... need i say more? I can't... it's one of those films that you feel it, there's no possible way to describe it! Either you love or you hate it! If that's the case, you hate it, try and see again, accepting what you see as it is, not trying to find a logic! Cheers... First time I saw this movie, I felt like passion that is looking for the shape.Someone has made a masterpiece! David lynch could only be the one.There's no choice when watching this movie: you hate it or you love it, no way to stay in the middle! Outside it seems nothing is moving, but inside your sensations go as the speed of light.Photography is fantastic , soundtrack is amazing. Bill Pullman perfectly matched with his role, Patricia Arquette is simply wonderful,Robert Blake and his incredible face and ,first of all David Lynch. If you are a cult movies fan, this is a great gift to you, if not try this, you won't regret it This movie gives me a headache everytime I see it, BUT it is a self-imposed headache because I have so much fun puzzle-solving and re-interpretating. I love all of the characters, the surreal screen shots, the sound track, and the plot - it is soo intricate and well thought out. It's so dreamlike that you're constantly fighting over whether to sit back and enjoy the scenery or figure out the who/what/when of the dreams. Overall, I've seen this movie three times now and was never bored once. If you watch this movie actively there is always something to think about. For instance, in my third watching I attempted to decipher the significance of all the scenes that occur twice, the use of bright light at certain scenes, and the similarity of scenes in which the same song was played. If you are the compulsive movie watcher that I am, you'll give this movie a 10 as well. Also, I wrote my interpretation on my website. It's a couple pages and too much to put on here, so email me if interested. It's basically saying - SPOILERS - that both Pete and the Mystery Man are alter ego's of Fred and that everything occuring after the imprisonment is a fantasy, though certain parts before are entirely actual either. lost highway is one of the most impressive films ive ever seen. its amazing how david lynch made me pensive once again (just like he did when i watched his other works) i think no-one really understands this movie but everybody can interpret it in his own way and i think everybody interprets it in a differént way...thats what makes the movie being one of the greatest works in movie history. *possible minor spoiler, if you can indeed spoil this film*<br/><br/>David Lynch is certainly one of the most interesting film directors of our time, and _Lost Highway_ certainly lives up to this.  Stylistically and thematically, it resembles _Eraserhead_, though that particular film is extremely straightforward by comparison.  Although the thematic elements and character changes are emphasized in _Lost Highway_, the film often piles on so many layers of symbolism and mystique that the film is lost forever to the casual viewer.  Even individuals such as myself who pay close attention to Lynch and have some awareness of his themes get confused by this film. Probably the most daunting obstacle to understanding is the fact that Lynch works within his own little filmic conception of reality, in which time and memory are simply two suggested options rather than objective reference points in a story line.<br/><br/>As some advice to those who may see the film, I offer this: try looking at the film from the standpoint of personal relationships and how we think about them.  Although this framework does hit some snags, it can provide a useful way of thinking about the film that might let you figure out just what the hell is wrong with David Lynch.  :) I FIGURED IT OUT! I know what the lost highway is about. Now, here is the real plot of the movie:  SPOILER ALERT!!! Fred Madison (Bill Pullman) is a depressed blues musician in an unhappy marriage. He finds out that his wife, Rene Madison (Patricia Arquette) has secretly been doing porno movies with Dick Laurent (Robert Loggia) and Andy (Michael Massee) after someone mails him a video tape of her in a sexual act. Fred looses it and kills his wife. He is convicted of murder and goes to jail. He escapes his prison cell through the ceiling and breaks out of jail. He tracks down Andy at his porno pimp pad, and kills him. Then he finds Dick Laurent in a motel room having sex. He captures him, drives him out to the desert and shoots him to death. Now, the big thing is, the movie isn't supposed to be about the real plot, it is about what the murderer, Fred, thinks in a split second. The movie actually takes place all in a fraction of a second, that is why "Dick Laurent is dead" is at the beginning of the movie and the end. Fred has a mental problem that has put him in a state of confusion. He's gone insane, and so he keeps seeing all these different "possible" realities about what happened. Fred states that he doesn't like video cameras because he likes to remember things in his own way, not how they actually happened. That is why the video of him is him killing his wife, where at that point in the movie, he hadn't killed her yet. And at the end, The Mysterious Guy goes after Pete (Fred's imaginary identity) with a video camera, and when he does that, he turns back into Fred. I thought of all this while I was in the shower this morning. Tell me what you think about it? (Oh, and to be totally honest, I guessed at the character of "Andy." If that wasn't the guy, please excuse me. It might have been "Al" or "John Doe" or whatever.) Well, this is one of such movies. Such movies which you either LOVE or HATE. And man, I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! I've got a maximum of 1,000 words, so I won't get into details. I just wanna say that this is one of the VERY FEW movies that's got everything in its right place.<br/><br/>After having seen the film for the first time, I discussed for hours with a friend. And I still didn't get the answer. Just like the second, third, fourth etc. time.<br/><br/>It only seemed the Lost Highway-mystery became more and more FASCINATING. And if I'd to describe this movie in 1 keyword, it'll be that one: FASCINATING!!!<br/><br/>And whether you hate or love this movie, it IS a fascinating one!!!! One of the best films of the 90´s. A film that makes you think and that you have to concentrate when you see. That's rare in these days, when movies like "Con Air" and "The rock" dominates the market. Lynch takes us on a trip into the depths of the human psyche. Especially in the conscious of guilt. It's a perfect cast, none of the actors involved have never been better. Not much dialog, instead Lynch makes looks, touches, sound and light tell the most of the story and it works perfect. Less is more as they say. A must see from one of the most interesting directors alive today. A terrific new masterwork from David Lynch!  Perhaps his best film since Blue Velvet, Lynch gives us now the 90's take on urban alienation.  True, it isn't a film for everyone, and The Straight Story is more accessible, but Lost Highway is Classic Lynch.  At its core is this idea; even if we had the chance to do it all over again, we'd probably do it the exact same way. With the white-faced Robert Blake, Lost Highway becomes a sort of urban Seventh Seal...!  There is actually a lot of humor in the movie too, and I highly recommend this film for serious fans of quirky avant-garde! This is a visually beautiful film whose plot is less than obvious or comprehensible.  I have one rule for film; mostly, the story has to be good drama.  Everything else is gravy.  If the story sucks, for me, the film sucks.  David Lynch's films are the only exception I have found to my rule. He can practically do anything, and I forgive him the storylines.  Many of his films have stories that are quite good, though - perplexing, intriguing, and fascinating.  But where he really excels is in painting a beautiful, lush landscape within which the story can unfold, no matter if it's infuriating, or divine.  This one is frustrating, but that doesn't take away from the emotion it leaves.  Patricis Arquette is as good as I have ever seen her, and since I've seen her here I can't imagine anyone else in this wonderful role.  The movie, overall, is interesting but not great.  7 out of 10.  Recommended instead is Mulholland Drive, which completely knocks it out of the park, on the essential areas of cinema - especially the screenplay, concept, acting - and contains even more lush, dark beauty than Lost Highway. Out of the tons of films I've seen, only a handful has changed the way I feel, think and experience life. Out of this handful, only one has kept me ACTIVELY occupied for more than hundred hours after seeing it for the first time - this being Lost Highway.<br/><br/>Lynch is a genius filmmaker. He follows in the steps of recent masters like Tarkovsky and Bergman, making films that won't force its contents on you, but films that allow the viewer to construct a meaning out of the multiple impressions it presents. Lost Highway does exactly that - it's like this game where you are to connect the dots with lines - but this time the dots aren't numbered, and they can be connected in a large number of ways, thus presenting different results.<br/><br/>I've seen this film six times, each time I discover new possibilities, and each time I think I've got it all figured out. But then I talk to another film buff, who presents a completely new angle. I've read some of the comments on this site, and find a lot of them interesting, especially the ones comparing it to Faust.<br/><br/>To sum it all up: if you have an open mind, a genuine interest in cinematic art and want a film that lives with you forever, this is the one. For those of you who've seen it and want to dig deeper into it's core, I suggest you read the articles and essays on the film available on the internet. david lynch again demonstrates his ability in this haunting portrayal of the depth and power of human consciousness.  guilt, jealousy, and brutality fuel this journey into the madness of a man, and soon we see how this horror extends beyond the individual, transcending singularity and invading all of humanity.  lynch offers us the opportunity to gaze into the unending hollows of a mobius strip, a double-edged study of the most basic (and evil) elements of our mental make-up, and the ramifications of acting them out. I really like this movie...the lighting in this movie is incredible, I like how the characters just emerge from the shadows. Excellent directing from Mr. Lynch and a very good cast, love the cameo by Henry Rollins..the story is complex and dark like most of Lynch's films, I had to watch this movie twice before I had any real sense of what happens in the plot. The story moves a little slow but for me the whole feel of the movie that Lynch creates with the lighting and sound was intense and scary. Plus, he throws in an excellent scene about the dangers of tailgating. This movie is not for everyone, if you like straight forward movies that are easy to follow and predictable, then you make want to stay off the Lost highway. I would say this is the quintessential Lynch-movie, even though people tend not to agree with me on that. Evereywhere I look, it gets mediocre reviews, although it deserves a top-rating. Lynch is not to be understood - he is to be FELT! And experience a surreal tour of absurdity. LIVE the abnormal and horrifying world of his and be happy you're not actually there, because if you do - you die... In "Blue Velvet" and "Twin Peaks" for instance, there still is a great deal of "reality" that you can relate to, as opposed to "Eraserhead". But in "Lost Highway"  it starts off with a kind of reality that soon seems to be worth nothing. With this one - you can loose the grip of yourself, and afterward (hopefully) return to wherever it is that you live. I'm not sure if any user has published this idea before, so I feel I have to do it. I've seen the movie many times and I think that each spoken word has a deeper meaning because there aren't many spoken words in all. In my opinion Lynch was definitely inspired by Goethe's "Faust". This strange man's behavior resembles Mephisto's in many ways. He says that he only comes when he is called and this means that Fred suspects his wife of having deceived him and therefore wants to repay her for it. Fred and the strange man make somehow a deal and the strange man gets Fred's soul at the end, when it becomes obvious that both have a bizarre deal. Before the strange man appears for the first time you hear a dog barking in Fred and Renee's neighborhood. That is a further parallel to Goethe's "Faust" where the devil, Mephisto, appears as a dog before he contacts Faust. In one scene at the beginning of the film, when Fred already suspects his wife, he asks: "Who the hell owns this dog?" I think that the word "hell" is more likely chosen very carefully than a pure accident. If you enjoy shallow movies with little complexity and less originality, stay away from Lost Highway.  If you are ready for a mind-bending hellride testing your cerebral prowess, watch it soon. This is quite possibly Lynch's best film. Lost Highway is a wonderful intellectual challenge. I've seen it some four times now, and am only starting to grasp what's actually told in the movie. LH is a non-linear movie. "I like to remember things my own way. That's not necessarily the way they happened" to me is the key to understanding the story, just as the photograph at the end of the movie: only ONE Renee. The factual story I think actually is quite simple: Fred finds out Renee is unfaithful to him and that the excessively filthy Mr. Eddy is involved in this. He kills both and gets jailed. What LH shows is the psychological story: Fred makes up a story that he actually believes in. I'll throw my disclaimer out there by stating that I know that "Lost Highway" is a hard film to sit through.  I'll admit that the first time I viewed it, I squirmed.  In fact, I think I may have dozed off somewhere in the mid-section (appropriate since the film takes on a dream/nightmare-like quality).  I would've probably written this film off like the majority of the world, but I started to realize that I couldn't shake off this movie. Damn, it won't leave me.  Certain images and scenes set-up tent and camped out in my psyche.  (So, after re-reading my mangled copy  of "Crime and Punishment," and after watching the "E!" True Hollywood Story on O.J., I came to reassess my opinion of "Lost Highway" and decided to reassess this film).<br/><br/>Be forewarned, SPOILER plot-points (and one viewer's interpretation) are forthcoming...<br/><br/>I think it's a genius-move on Lynch's part to make a film about the power of "denial", set in Los Angeles - a surreal city notorious for crushing the dreams and reality of its citizenry. I'm sure many can relate to that, but don't want to necessarily be reminded of it at their local Cineplex Odeon. But I don't mind it, because there's real beauty to find in this film's surreal brutality.  I'm sure most of us wonder how a person (a seemingly normal, successful person) could murder.  If there was any grain of interest to the O.J. trial, it was that.  This experience was like hanging out in the headspace of O.J. for two hours.  After all, we're talking about a successful man, Fred Madison (Bill Pullman or O.J., take your pick) who can't take responsibility for killing his wife, Renee (Patricia Arquette). And rather than look at the truth, it's better to create a whole new life/fantasy while stagnating in jail.  Enter Pete (Balthazar Getty), Fred's doppelganger.  But Fred/Pete can't escape the truth.  Everything and everyone that Fred tries to forget re-emerges in his new reality, Pete's reality.  Thus, the descent into Hell, or Fred's "Lost Highway" is neverending.<br/><br/>This is heady stuff.  This interpretation (one of many - but a good starting point for most) lends itself to the idea that one must be open to seeing this film MORE THAN ONCE in order to truly have an experience.  It's too deceptively easy to dismiss, but there's a lot here to embrace.  How many filmmakers out there are doing movies like this?  A true movie about a "thinking man's" insanity, starring a cast of scarred psyches (Gary <motorcycle-rehab> Busey, Balthazar <strained family history> Getty, Natasha Gregson (daughter of drowned mother, Natalie Wood> Wagner, Richard <Parkinson's> Pryor, Robert <publicized breakdown> Blake, etc.).  These choices were no accident.  This film is an incredible work of art.  It may not be for most since it is HARSH, but no one should deny its understanding of what drives sensible people over the edge.<br/><br/>Not many films nowadays can really pull that off.<br/><br/>And as for entertainment value, I can watch Robert Loggia smacking around the tailgator until the end of time. I've been reading some of these reviews and I really wish that you people would stop comparing it to Mr. Lynch's past works.  Of course there is a little bit of resemblance in the characters that he's used in the past. They worked quite well in my opinion so why shouldn't he stick to the same general formula?<br/><br/>I feel the Lynch is one of the most brilliant film makers ever to exist. His movies make a person think.  They are like an intricate puzzle and he allows you to apply your own interpretation.  Personally I don't like having someone else thinking for me so all of his movies are a very special treat every single time I watch them.<br/><br/>Also, if you people aren't mature enough to look past the nudity and the sex then I personally feel that you shouldn't be watching movies at all.<br/><br/>Watch Lost Highway.  Watch it more than once.  If you are an independent thinker you will appreciate them. I guarantee it. If any of you who read this have not seen a David Lynch movie before, this might be too schocking. In case you've had, then you know what to expect... perhaps. In this movie we find again the "lethal" combination of Barry Gifford and David Lynch, let's remember that Gifford wrote the novel that Lynch converted into the Wild At Heart movie. Well, what they give us here is definitely a wonderful mind trip. We have Bill Pullman on a great but short characterization (anyway, he's the key to everything) along with Patricia Arquette playing a couple (or maybe not) of roles that will make a mess out of your mind. The rest of cast, specially Balthazar Getty is great. Lynch's style hasn't changed, it grows more and more weird with every feature: fast shocking images, weird dialogues and very very strange situations along with a teasing soundtrack (from David Bowie to Rammstein) and an unexpected ending make this one a must for those who like David Lynch, and an experience worth living it for those who had never seen a Lynch's movie before (my warning for you is: be ready for anything!) Do you ever have those dreams where you know you're dreaming and this knowledge becomes part of the dream itself? That's the feeling I had when I first watched this one. It's sheer magic - every frame soaked w/ that atmosphere balancing on a tight rope just exactly half way in between the conscious and the sub-conscious.<br/><br/>The plot itself is not really important - it's the fascination of the journey itself that is the most important. Just imagine those unreal shots from inside the car at night - they're like from an alien place, inside you.<br/><br/>It is a different story for every viewer. A story that is only hinted at, never spoon fed and if you pay attention and open up to it it'll stay w/ you for a long time. It's that kind of movie. I first saw this movie in a culture festival at 1.00 o clock after midnight. During the film i was not sure whether i was awake or not. After the film was over me and some friends went for a drink and for 2 hours we were trying to understand what we have just seen.<br/><br/>I believe that the Lost Highway is the masterpiece of David Lynch. His unique direction takes the viewer in an another place where nothing is real and nothing is true. This along with the superb music of Angelo Badalamenti makes this film one of the greatest films of all times.<br/><br/>After a few months i bought the tape and i have seen the movie 5 or 6 times. Each time i discover something new something i did not noticed before. The last time i saw movie i had drunk half a bottle of ouzo (greek liquer something like sabuka) and everything were very clear in my mind. It was then when i found the real meaning of this movie. You can not see and understand Lost Highway. You just live in it. Sat down with my second half hoping to watch a good movie with a twist and I genuinely haven't watched a bigger pile rubbish in my life.<br/><br/>I seem to be seeing all these people reviewing it saying "oh what art". probably the people you see in art galleries staring at a painting with someone else, pointing at it for an hour. Shouldn't need to analyse a film to understand it. You should be able to just watch it and enjoy it.<br/><br/>Honestly genuinely, genuinely the worst movie I have ever seen. If you don't want to listen to sane people that have reviewed this - give it 5 minutes and see what you think.<br/><br/>A lot of staring, walking and weird music ! I saw this film yesterday and the first thing that you may think after finishing the film is " oh my god what a terrible film" I don't know how Mr. Lynch can describe his film and the inconsecutive in it. He can easily continue his film forever. When the death is not the end point of the film. Suppose Andy live again and try to kill Fred. Suppose we see Peter in a new life and he become a girl and and andÂ… I never understand what the reason of the mystery man was. You can change this character wit a child or a girl and nothing would happen. Suppose we have a good film in camera and in edit or even in director but the main problem is the very bad story of this film. Highly not recommended, don't waste your time and energy on this one, as I did, instead of doing something useful. Two entirely wasted hours. After watching this movie you feel empty and angry for the wasted time. I have no idea why people rated this one so high. It doesn't make sense, since there is no meaning, no script, no inner idea. The only one scene I liked was one Fred and Renee made love in front of the car, the lights game was beautiful - that's it. Doesn't justify the sacrifice of two hours of your life! Lost Highway finds Lynch just as confused as his audience. He exploits Patricia Arquette to no end, showing us her naked body as though it were a Star Wars special effect every few minutes. As a feminist accidentally born with testicles, I found this very offensive. Furthermore, I couldn't help but feel this movie has a conservative message underneath all the flash and weirdness. When we see Patricia Arquette on a movie screen, in a porno film, near the end of the movie, a harsh, seeming gregorian chant from a Ramstein song (and let's not pretend we don't know what THOSE GUYS represent..,) plays on the soundtrack. In an almost Spielbergian gesture of fascist filmmaking, the audience is forced to find something negative in a woman's choice to do with her body what she wants. Shame on you, Mr. Lynch!<br/><br/>When you pull apart the pieces of Lost Highway and examine them, the movie doesn't make much sense, I'm afraid to say. I'm one of those people who loves to claim that, "If you didn't like it, you didn't get it!" But I'm afraid here, I can't defend modern art with that old standby. The fact of the matter is, Mr. Lynch's warmup for his masterpiece, Mulholland Dr., is an emperor with no clothes. First of all I have to say that I really enjoyd Twin Peaks and after all the hype what LH got I was thrilled to see it.<br/><br/>But hey! This was one of the worst films I have ever seen. It seemed like a bad essey. First it started interesting (well, kind of... a little bit slow), but on second part Lynch started to trash. He just used cut-paste-techinique to sew something for the audience! The plot is almost unvisible & forgotten and was covered by bare tits, Rammstein, Twiggy & Manson having sex (with girls, sorry :). Also the actors were pretty bad, but knowing Lynch, it might have been the idea...<br/><br/>Hopefully Mulholland Drive is better! A musician and his wife apparently live in a parallel universe where they also have lives as a teenage garage mechanic and a mobster's girlfriend...maybe. Madman filmmaker David Lynch is straining too hard here to live up to his reputation as a cinema eccentric extraordinaire; unfortunately, his dialogue and plot set-up is far too conventional for such an insane journey, with twisted roads that just take us in endless circles. One longs to see at least one character break out of the all-encompassing movie-magazine pulp, and here that's Robert Loggia getting revenge on a tailgater (the liveliest part of the film, though nothing is built upon it). Robert Blake is a scary presence as a mystery man, but Patricia Arquette seems cast just for her breasts and curvy figure (Lynch doesn't even use his own fetishism as film-subtext; the nudity is just there for us to gawk at). A real dead-end, "Lost Highway" hasn't a hope in hell of breaking through to us, due to a director who has seemingly lost control of the reins on his own sticky, paranoid delusions and fascination for sleazy glamor. *1/2 from **** Even with advance preparation for "Lost Highway" by viewing of a documentary on cable about David Lynch, I, along with the actors I think, couldn't figure out what it was about. But then the only Lynch I've seen before this was "Twin Peaks. "<br/><br/>The documentary showed that Lynch considers himself primarily a visual artist and designed all the set furniture (I thought the camera was lovingly looking at an odd-looking couch for too long). The visual images are alluring.<br/><br/>He has influenced TV and movies so much that he's been bypassed by "The X Files" and Tarantino (while Robert Loggia seemed really grateful to be in an art house movie for a change his character was straight out of "Reservoir Dogs"). Robert Blake too seemed grateful for not being cast as a cop and I think this was Bill Pullman's first arty movie.<br/><br/>But this movie is really just an explicit "X Files" episode and was a mile-wide and an inch thin in theme and meaning. I think a major theme was proving that Patricia Arquette's breasts are natural and not implants. I did appreciate in the documentary that she complained that it was the most physically grueling shoot she'd done - must have been hard to get all the sand out of everything. There was some lame effort to make some point about pornography and violence but I felt it was a fig leaf. The movie "Bound" was way more interesting in providing an updated take on the femme fatale, as Lynch has a very stereotyped view of that. <br/><br/>Par for the course, a couple of people walked out of the theater. It'll certainly lose its visual beauty on video so if you turn off your brain and just go for psychedelic images and want to see Arquette naked a lot, go see it in the theater.<br/><br/>Lynch was very much involved in all the music and it was wonderful, both the pre-existing songs and Angelo "Bad Angel's" score. <br/><br/>(originally written 3/20/1997) David Lynch has a trick. It's not clever or even original, but his followers seem to love it. He splices his films together out of sequence.<br/><br/>So when watching Lost Highway don't be confused when, after a man is caught for a murder, the film suddenly moves to an apparently different story. It is merely that you have watched the story from its middle to the end, and are now having to watch it from the beginning to the middle.<br/><br/>The trick means that the opening and closing scenes of the film, featuring a dwarf, are the same point in the middle of the story. It also means that when the story ends (in a prison cell) and the story restarts (in a prison cell) in the middle of the film it seems, even to the characters, that one man has metamorphosed into another.<br/><br/>A friend described this trick as a work of genius, transforming the film into a Mobius strip (ie a length of paper that has been twisted before having its ends joined together, meaning that you can draw a continuous line on both sides of the paper before coming back to your starting point). He is a fool.<br/><br/>If you own a DVD of Lost Highway (and God help you if you do) you could watch the story from beginning to end by using the scene selection function. If you did, you would see a rather bland, if wilfully obscure, film that concentrates more on lighting and quirkiness than plot or character.<br/><br/>It is interesting in an artistic sense because it divorces the film from its narrative, but the two hours and 15 minutes are far from interesting in any other sense. It is all rather indulgent and, like Lynch's other narrative-juggling film Mulholland Drive, makes you think that he is using a trick to disguise the mundanity of his writing.<br/><br/>It should be noted that out-of-sequence films do not have to be bad. Memento, directed by the infinitely more talented and less pretentious Christopher Nolan, told the story of an amnesiac avenging his wife's death by showing scenes in reverse order. It is brilliant, not only because it is thrilling and characterful, but because the plot device puts you at the same disadvantage as the protagonist. You do not know what has happened immediately beforehand.<br/><br/>With Lynch, by contrast, his justification for splicing his films together in the wrong order is weaker. He does seem to have something to say about schizophrenia, but it would be a lot more illuminating if his films weren't so incomprehensible and, consequently, boring. Lost Highway appears to have a plot, but if you're bourgeois enough to be fooled into following what plot it appears to have, you deserve to be bored and frustrated. That's because Lost Highway is a film by David Lynch about how brilliant David Lynch is and nothing else.<br/><br/>As long as you accept that David Lynch has no intention of entertaining you, has no obligation to repay the time you spend engaging with his work, and in fact considers an audience completely superfluous, you'll appreciate Lost Highway in the manner intended.<br/><br/>Like the saxophone player at the beginning blowing random notes as hard as he can with no regard to whether anything coming out is harmonious, expressive or even listenable, your writer/director has only to put his boring, self-indulgent, onanistic stream of consciousness on the screen. You don't matter, he doesn't care. Job done. First time I watched Lynch's movie and I'd say I absolutely loved this movie. I have always loved to watch a good flick that puts my brain to the test. Maybe the film isn't suppose to make much sense, but that's what I love about it. You have to try and analyze it and make your own theories about what just happened. This movie isn't for everyone i guess but very worth watching! Lynch is always working on a creative and artistic level. He is the master at creating challenging and surreal films which defy all rules of film-making (the one exception being his only straight-forward film, The Elephant Man). Lost Highway was of course another one in his list of mysteries, yet I think it is his most mainstream film to date.<br/><br/>The opening 30 minutes of Lost Highway brilliantly work out in the form of a truly scary thriller/horror film. By the time the 40 minute mark reaches, the film takes a whole new path, which of course is expected in a Lynch film. The film is never dull or boring, and it does have a lot of surreal scenes that will mystify and confuse viewers, but I still think it is a film that would work with mainstream audiences. I can see many movie fans being perplexed by the turns the film takes, yet still highly enjoy it, and in that respect, I think it is because Lynch is probably trying to make a film that will be a commercial hit (seeing as how Twin Peaks Fire Walk With Me flopped despite it being one of his best). I can definitely sense him making this one for the audience (unlike his newest film, Inland Empire, which got better reviews with the critics than Lost Highway yet seems to frustrate viewers a lot more). Saying that, I do think that parts of the film are not as engaging as some of his other films. <br/><br/>Ultimately though, Lost Highway still builds on Lynch's impressive resume, although from the 7 films that I have seen from him, this is in the bottom along with The Elephant Man. Yet, Lynch's weaker entries are still better than most films out there, which this is because I am sure it will become a favorite of mine as well. The soundtrack also rocks, and in a way parts of the film reminded me of Blue Velvet (which is one of Lynch's most understandable films). Bless the bizarre. David Lynch delivers a haunting experience for all your eyes and mind.<br/><br/>Please don't try to understand the plot because it would confuse your mind and movie culture abilities.<br/><br/>My advice for those who are interested in this movie is to relax, and go with the flow. I mean, enjoy every single scene because all of them are relevant for the plot and best of all, for the character development which is crucial in order to understand most of the movie's dark and sinister purposes.<br/><br/>Don't watch it as a Horror movie or as a Crime oriented Thriller because "Lost Highway" is just a sui generis experience that mixes the most interesting aspects of any movie genre. For example, on the Horror genre it relies the creepiness of the character's situations such as inner demons and evil presence (represented in such a devilish but stylish style by Robert Blake, brrrr). Then the movie is covered by an atmosphere of crime and mystery that will keep you on grabbing your seat. Finally, when the atmosphere is at it's peak of mystery and darkness, a series of weird events will take form and you can actually understand the movie...your own way.<br/><br/>This is why "Lost Highway" is one of the most complex, bizarre, haunting, and even disturbing viewing experiences you will ever have. A masterpiece on it's own.<br/><br/>The best feature of the movie is David Lynch's direction; it's solid, dark, elegant, innovative. You just can't define what kind of movie you're watching; I mean, it looks indie at some points and with scenes such as the sex on the desert, it looks like a production made in a classy underworld. It's just unreal but spectacular, dark and beautiful.<br/><br/>The acting is just spectacular. Bill Pullman delivers a badass performance surrounded by uncertainty. Patricia Arquette is the hottest woman in the world in this movie. She demonstrates she's a versatile actress. The rest of the cast including Henry Rollins is just great and deserve a cult status.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is amazing; you can't go wrong with Trent Reznor producing and performing with the right amount of David Bowie's collaborations.<br/><br/>This is a cult movie that should only be viewed by those who are interested on it. Otherwise, skip it; it's not for everyone. When I worked as a clerk at Blockbuster, I issued a "LOST HIGHWAY" challenge to both my favorite customers and more than a few co-workers: $100 in cold, hard cash to the first person who could come up with a complete narrative storyline that fully explained the events depicted in David Lynch's deeply disturbing, manic opus.<br/><br/>I was secure in the secret knowledge that I would never have to pay off the wager...and it still stands today.<br/><br/>If you have seen even one single Lynch film, you already know better. David has always been less about spoon-feeding narrative to the audience than leading them to a whole table filled with strange items, allowing them to "taste" each visual, each character, each scenario for themselves, and deciding on their own what kind of "brain food" it is, and whether or not they like it.<br/><br/>Who was it that said that talking about love is like 'dancing about architecture'? A fitting way to describe a Lynch film, particularly this one.<br/><br/>But if you're a moviegoer who staunchly requires some kind of linear storytelling before you invest any time in a movie, I'll try to keep this as simple as I can. As simply as you can compartmentalize any of David's work...which is impossible.<br/><br/>Fred Madison (Bill Pullman) is a musician, a sax-player in an avant-garde jazz combo. He is married to Renee (Patricia Arquette), an attractive blond woman who seems to spend a lot of time home alone while Fred plays his gigs at night. Fred suspects that Renee might be seeing other men in his absence. Renee resents this, and the tension and mistrust strains their marriage. Adding a brand new layer of paranoia is a series of mysterious video tapes that they begin to find on their doorstep each morning.<br/><br/>At first, the image on the tapes is simply the front of their house during the daytime, and nothing more. But gradually, the images become more frightening, as the mystery cameraperson goes from the front of the house on one tape, to inside the house on the next, photographing the living room, the hallway, and finally Fred and Renee asleep in their bedroom...<br/><br/>They call the police, who naturally can do nothing to help them. Shortly after the latest tape, Renee is murdered and Fred is arrested as the prime suspect.<br/><br/>Pete Dayton (Balthazar Getty) is released from jail with a head wound and little recollection about how he got there in the first place. Pete works as a mechanic, repairing cars for full-time psychotic thug and part-time car enthusiast Mr. Eddy (Robert Loggia). Adding to Pete's confusion is a world of trouble - he has the hots for his boss's woman, Alice Wakefield...who could pass for Renee Madison's twin sister.<br/><br/>Pete wants to help Renee get away from Mr. Eddy, but while he tries to make it happen, he begins to discover disturbing clues that lead to possible answers about his amnesia...how he got into jail and what he was there for...and what part that both Alice and Mr. Eddy might have in what happened.<br/><br/>Both of these stories play like separate but very similar movies unto themselves, with only one thread that connects them in any kind of concrete way...a sinister figure only known as the Mystery Man (Robert Blake).<br/><br/>That's all I want to tell you. That's all I CAN tell you...Everything else you need to know is there between the lines...and the lights. The details that need filling in for someone of limited imagination will prove maddeningly elusive, because LOST HIGHWAY is less a narrative crime thriller than a tone poem of existential angst that dreams of being a crime thriller. Lynch does some of the most chilling, unsettling work in HIGHWAY with lighting or the absence of light, than in any other film he's ever made.<br/><br/>There are times you feel that if you looked closely enough, you can almost grasp the 'key' that will make all the puzzle pieces fall into place...but at the same time, you're almost too scared to know what the answers really are...<br/><br/>Make any sense yet? If not, then you need to see it for yourself. Only you can decide at last what waits at the end of this HIGHWAY...or even if there is an end at all.<br/><br/>Oh, and by the way...wanna make $100? Do you remember the world of strange, dark dreams? They are irrational, when you analyze them with your logic brain you'll never get their point or understand their meaning. That is simply because they are not rational, but have elements in them that simply cannot be in the real world of reason. THeir point is in the underlying feeling, the implicit atmosphere defying all reason. Such is Lost Highway. When you look at it trying to "understand" it from the point of view of logic, you'll get lost in your own thoughts, and that is what Lynch wants: it simply doesn't make sense...for your logic capacities. It makes a lot of sense, like all dreams/nightmares do, for your subconsciousness, for your darker and irrational side. Look at this film like it is one of your strange, irrational dreams conveying to you unknown parts of yourself and strange fears, and search to feel the unspoken feeling behind the ir-reason, and you'll find this quite an exceptional movie! Simply a brilliant way to put our nightmare like dark side (wild & erotic sex, strange fears, death, lust for power...) reality into a film! ALso, mind the casting: fantastic characters that all have a dream-like strangeness. The sublime thing about the film is that all characters constantly suggest some deeper, unspoken sides of themselves, sides that are there, but are never really dug into or revealed to the viewer. (the film score helped a lot!) Modern film noir in the style of Silence of the Lambs, Basic Instinct, Eyes Wide shut in that its main theme is the subconscious dark, irrational side lurking behind the corner of normal, everyday and rational life. It is one of those where you can't really understand everything that is going, but you pretty much keep watching it anyway. Basically sax player Fred Madison (Bill Pullman) and his wife Renee Madison (a gorgeous Patricia Arquette) call the police when someone sends a video of the inside of their house. Then it goes really weird when Fred turns young and becomes Peter Raymond Dayton (Balthazar Getty) with his own story involving the mob and the boss, Mr. Eddy/Dick Laurent (Robert Loggia) and his girlfriend Alice Wakefield (Arquette again with blonde instead dark brown hair). The highlights for me are all the sex references, some violence, and of course, Arquette's wonderful breasts and bottom. Also starring Robert Blake as Mystery Man, Natasha Gregson Wagner as Sheila, Richard Pryor as Arnie, Lucy Butler as Candace Dayton, Michael Massee as Andy, Jack Nance as Phil, Lisa Boyle as Marian and Marilyn Manson as Porno Star #1. An interesting film from director David Lynch. Very good! It starts in a relatively normal way and I enjoy the simple plot and increasingly dark mood. Just like "narrator15's" comment I got lost early on in the drive. I tried hard to understand and think about what Lynch is symbolist with the series of events and characters which unfold in a random and anarchic fashion. I enjoy a thought provoking film like Malice and Se7en but this film frustrated me but was entertaining at the same time.<br/><br/>I gave it 7/10 it would have been 6/10 if not for an awesome soundtrack especially the I'm deranged-edit track by David Bowie which closed the film with the view of the dashed road lines which reminded me of the end of Terminator 2. Dick Laurent rules! Oh, by the way, Don't tailgate!!! Bill Pullman is actually likeable and believable. Arquettes! Yes, there are four of them. Typical Lynch that makes you think and feel strange. Don't go driving afterwards or accept videos from strangers. An excellent flick. An atonishing performance : I lived the movie physically, and had nightmares about it. David Lynch definitely knows the way to make things move in the deepest parts of oneself. Lost Highway, to my mind, is Lynch at his most uninspired and unoriginal which, by the standards of his other films, is not such an criticism. Yet Lost Highway seems to present a mismash of his previous works. The apparent similarities of Arquette's character with Isabella Rosselinis's in Blue velvet (dark, ambiguous), Dick Lauront with Santos in Wild at Heart (bad guy with some very obscure dealings) e.tc. sit uncomfortably next to the supposed innovative lunacy that, as his trademark, Lynch is trying to portray here. Yet this is certainly not a poor film, Lynch has evoked an excellent sense of film-noir through his cast (even making Bill Pullman seem quite appealing);  silence and a sense of impending horror is used to stunning effect, certainly to the best Lynch has ever used it before; and as always we are visually and audially stunned (even if many of the "symbols" here are such throwaways). The mystery man has got to be Lynchs penultimate eerie character, and David Bowies voice as the road rolls on and on is glorious. Watch it - if just for the unbelievably unsettling mobile phone scene, where Lynch will prove he can still scare the s**t out of you in his own perverse way. Butter dish? Yes, butter dish! But how can one eat parrot in a butter dish? Don't question me, I am the king of england! How good it is to see the king of england admiring a parrot in a butter dish. Fetch a cup and dig for metal. I have achived my goal and have a handfull of silver. Now make a butter dish. butter dish? yes, butter dish! etc etc etc etc....<br/><br/>(For those of you saying "What the hell?" that was what I was saying at the conclusion of this film.) Generally, I am willing to give any movie a chance.  But this movie just moved too slowly, was way too obscure and disjointed and could not hold my attention.  I would never recommend it to someone else to watch.  The video taped sequences moving the plot were interesting and the whole body-swapping and ensuing coincidences were somewhat compelling, but there was not enough build-up of suspense or cohesiveness to make me really care how it ended....I just hoped it would eventually end. After having seen "Mulholland Drive" and finding it's rearranged narrative gimmick a poor excuse for trying to pass off a LONG dream as a film with hardly any social value, I decided to give Lynch a second chance with "Lost Highway". Either I just saw the same bad film twice, or "Lost Highway" was even worse.<br/><br/>There seems to be a lot of concern over the plot of the film--most of it on whether or not one even exists. Let's take Lynch at his word and on credit, piece the fragments of the schizophrenic Pullman character together, and contrive the plot of a jealous lover seeking revenge. Presentation aside, is this subject matter new, topical or even interesting? Does the film have a comment to make on that subject? Does the film have a comment to make on schizophrenia or mental derangement? The answer to all of these questions is simply no. I don't have a problem with Lynch's escapism or surrealism as a baseline for making a film. But I do have a problem with using those formats for no other purpose than to tell an uninteresting story that has such little social comment or value beyond being a different way of telling a simple, unappealing story.<br/><br/>There's a trend and flood of movies recently that seem to take place in the mind of the protagonist where the audience is forced, due to mental illness, a dream or some other reason, to accept the main character's mental state as the objective reality for the audience. But a writer/director should have a reason beyond just keeping the audience as confused as the main character for using that subconscious or alternate reality to tell the story. A few good examples of uses of this technique are "Jacob's Ladder", "Memento", "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind", and I would even add "Shutter Island" (though quite predictable) to that list. But "Lost Highway" uses this medium/format with no good reason other than to keep the audience as confused as the characters for the majority of the film.<br/><br/>With Mulholland Drive, the best you could take from the story was that Hollywood is a vapid and lonely place. In "Lost Highway", I can't pinpoint anything Lynch has to say that hasn't been said before, let alone said exponentially more succinctly. And any style points are washed out by the lack of substance from the narrative. I will be frank with this odd movie shot by David Lynch. When I watched it for the first time, I didn't understand it at all. But a second vision helped me to follow it better because I had Lynch's definition about his movie in my head: "the story of a schizophrenic killer told from his different personalities' point of view". This helped me to follow better the film. However, it didn't gain my adhesion for all that.<br/><br/> Lynch's movie may be entrancing, scattered with strong sequences and fascinating characters. It is even reminiscent of "Family Plot" (1976) Hitchcock's last movie in its structure by the transition from one story to another. However, it brings out an impression of pretentious as if Lynch wanted to prove the spectator that he is the best filmmaker in the world. You can also notice that throughout his movie, he doesn't hesitate in multiplying the gaudy effects and erotic sequences. These particularities make the movie much too long. Then, certain points remain ambiguous and notably this one: who is this mysterious black man who appears throughout the movie like a leitmotiv?<br/><br/>In the end, breaking the narrative conventions, David Lynch signed an ambitious but pretentious film. Nevertheless, the director offers several possible interpretations about his work including this one: the whole film might be a dream. It would be the most convincing outline. Anyway, Lynch's fans since "Eraserhead" (1977) will be elated. As for the others, I would advise them to refrain from watching this work. One last thing I would say to Mr Lynch: originality is nice but there are some limits. All the Lynch's movies deal with sexuality and this one is the summit. For me, the story is about a jealous husband, who resents his impotence toward his sexy wife and acts like a rabbit when he is granted the possibility. Lynch being one of the best director ever, he sublimes this lust with art! <br/><br/>As in "Inland Empire", Lynch really does moving pictures (paintings). Starting with a beautiful frame, he adds top cast, sound, music, movement and the result is terrific and you remember for a long time those "magic moments", as the song in the movie! <br/><br/>In addition, Lynch addresses all the emotional ring, all the moods, all the genre so you are taken in a wild ride: Here, there's nothing to throw away: the opening credits with the dark highway, the sense of fear in the house, the stroboscopic jazz jam, the first sight, the suburban life, the desert sequences, the "film noir" shoots, the intimate scenes, <br/><br/>Maybe the story doesn't make sense but we are hostages from this mystery and finally, rarely a movie would have give such intense feelings! And for sure, Patricia has never got so nude and so sexy as well!<br/><br/>A masterpiece ! First of all, if you like David Lynch's films, then you might like this. Personally they're not my cup of tea. <br/><br/>Lost Highway's story is bizarre, and there's a lot of build up, but the ending is just disappointing. People often criticize the TV series Lost for having lost the plot halfway through the season. Lost Highway surpasses it by having absolutely no comprehensible plot at all. But many people will give Lost Highway a pass because it's supposed to be a work of art. Poppycock! The film is way too long and mostly nonsensical. <br/><br/>Personally I wouldn't recommend this film to the casual movie goer. But I'm still giving it a passing grade of 5/10 because it actually has some good scenes with great tension and atmosphere, but it's a pity they weren't better used in a film with a more comprehensible plot. I saw this movie when it was first released and have seen it about about 50 times since. Brilliant story-telling, excellent cinematography, and symbolism up the wazooo. I just finished watching it again for the 51st time and I still do not comprehend it 100%.<br/><br/>However, I do have one theory. After the metamorphosis, when Mr Eddy asks Pete to go for a ride, the tailgater is a big clue as to who Mr Eddy is. He's some type of law enforcement. When they pull the tailgater out of the car, Mr Eddy lectures him on reading a drivers manual and the safe distance to keep in order to stop safely. Like a power tripping cop.<br/><br/>I can't explain any more than that or how he comes into play with Renee, but it's just something to dwell on. very bad movie with stupid direction . .<br/><br/>I'm a mind fiction freak.. movies like TRIANGLE, IDENTITY, SECRET WINDOW, MEMENTO,...etc etc etc are my favorites.. including PREMONITION... I'm crazy about these kinda movies and still i didn't like LOST HIGHWAY.... which means ppl with other taste can forget about watching thz !!!.<br/><br/>movie is dead slow, slower than worm... dialogue is very very very less, ppl don't talk much, yet script is very good....! movie is loaded with hell of loose ends! its like TV serial . . . . . background music is cooool, enjoyed it :)<br/><br/>i have no offense on people who admire thz movie, but seriously I'm angry on those who voted for it... The main reason i watched is because of the rating is high !! this very bad is misguidance(personal opinion)..<br/><br/>I'm a damn movie freak, not a beginner... Trust me.. i know when a movie is interesting and when its not !!<br/><br/>This movie doesn't fall into the "so bad it's good" category: it falls into the "so bad its unwatchable" group..<br/><br/>My advice is buy a tin of paint, stick a pencil in it and watch it dry. It'll be far more entertaining...! Imagine you are a psychiatrist, and Lynch was laying on your sofa confessing his endless complexes. You would write a book on Psychiatry that would put Sigmund Freud in second place, behind you.
One strange thing is that this failure manages to find losers to invest on his crimes, which are not successful and in some cases financial disasters.
Also, I have heard and read a lot of insults to "ART".
Certainly, Lynch's films belong to the worst of them. "Lost Highway" is a little like trying to watch television while someone in another room constantly changes the channel with the remote control.<br/><br/>One theory, amongst many, contends that the movie replicates the feeling of schizophrenia. Although it may not be what Lynch had in mind, and certainly doesn't provide the perfect GPS for finding your way through this movie, it does warn you that the route ahead will probably be difficult. At a surface level, there are no resolutions; the film is as aimless as fate itself. Not that it should always be necessary for an explainer to come along and put everything in place à la the psychiatrist in "Psycho", but "Lost Highway" is particularly challenging as regards explanation.<br/><br/>Another commentator thinks that "Lost Highway" is set in hell. The highway equates with the astral plane, the crossover point on the way to being born and after death. In this context, the body is a vehicle and the soul a passenger. Passengers can be exchanged, and other ones picked up, which neatly explains why different actors can play variations of the same character. The theory, which has much more to it, is supported by the cyclic nature of the movie – circular actions being associated with hell where the denizens are condemned to perform repetitive, pointless behaviour. Wow! What a great theory. One problem though, I'm pretty sure David Lynch hasn't signed off on it. In a way, it actually sounds better than Lynch's movie.<br/><br/>A brief outline of the story is tricky but here goes.<br/><br/>Bill Pullman plays Fred Madison, who lives in Los Angeles with his wife, played by Patricia Arquette. When they receive a series of videos showing their home from the outside, then the inside, and then with them sleeping – they call the police.<br/><br/>At a party Fred meets a mysterious man played by Robert Blake who seems to know him, and claims that he has been in his home. This mystery man, who could be Fred's alter ego or an astral spirit according to the hell theory, reappears throughout the film. Reality is altered when Fred enters a dark, seemingly endless corridor in his home. Fred receives another video that shows him possibly murdering his wife. He ends up in jail where his troubled mental state overwhelms him.<br/><br/>A major transformation takes place at this point. When a guard checks on Fred's cell, he finds a completely different person in his place. No explanation is given for this change. The new character, Pete Dayton, played by Balthazar Getty is released and goes back to his former life, a different one to Fred Madison's. Many of the characters associated with Fred reappear in Pete's life but in different guises including Patricia Arquette as a gangster's girlfriend. Another complex scenario is played out before Fred Madison as played by Bill Pullman re-emerges towards the end.<br/><br/>By the time this happens, most in the audience will have abandoned any notion that the film will make sense – maybe we do need an explainer after all. As Lynch reflects in the extras on the DVD, the film is based on an idea – and that's the only clue he gives. Maybe Lynch is training us to view cinema and storytelling in a completely new way. One thing is for sure; "Lost Highway" is one trip where you need to proceed with caution because Lynch has deliberately switched all the road signs around. My summary above was somewhat harsh, but Patricia Arquette's performance is one of the things i remembered most vividly about Lost Highway. The movie follows a non-linear narrative which is almost a standard today but has been a minor revolution at the time of it's creation.<br/><br/>It is seldom that the crime underworld has been brought on screen in such a surrealist environment. Author's intent to lead the story nowhere is either well hidden or the producers held him on a tight leash. This hasn't been as successful in David Lynch's later work, but i think he's producing his own movies now.<br/><br/>A large portion of my vote, however, goes for the scenes with scantily clad Patricia Arquette... One of the online reviews claims that they worked out what happened in the movie and that everything happened in a set order.....my response is "idiots".<br/><br/>I can't remember who said it, but someone once said that in photography you play with light, in film you play with time. At the simplest you can speed things up or slow them down, you can jump around forward in time and have flashbacks.<br/><br/>But for David Lynch time really doesn't matter. It is like in a dream, everything is both obvious and obscure at the same time. Anything can happen, and often does.<br/><br/>Lost Highway is probably the best of Lynch's work. We have all the old elements that pop up again and again in his work. There are gangsters, damsels in distress and femme fatals (often they are are the same character), mysterious strangers who are controlling everything (are they a metaphor for Lynch himself), sex and of course lesbian sex.<br/><br/>I both like and hate Lynch. I always feel his work is too cheap. It is deliberately obscure and nonsensical so that the viewer has to impose their own meaning on to what they are watching. I do that anyway, and I like to be entertained on the way through.<br/><br/>The reason I like Lost Highway over many of Lynch's other works is that it is that the weirdness is much more toned down. I guess he no longer has to hit people over the head, watching a David Lynch film is an expectation of weirdness. When things remain fairly ordinary then we are looking at them even harder.<br/><br/>My view is that the story is both a straight line and a circle. Like the mythical lost highway, it is a road that connects to nothing but itself .The lost highway mythology crops up repeatedly in American literature, but has never managed to find a mainstream expression yet, this movie is about the idea of a lost highway, the roads themselves don't matter.<br/><br/>I propose that all David Lynch fans get together and try and create a David Lynch Style world especially aimed at Mr Lynch. I've enjoyed many Lynch movies over the years.  Lost Highway is in my mind the lowest point in Lynch's storied career.  I got the distinct impression that this movie was made as a vehicle to tie together a bunch of "scenes" David had floating around in that crazy imagination of his.  I watched Lost Highway in the hopes that eventually I would find something to pique my interest, or at least give this movie some sort of point. Alas, that was not to be.  Worth watching only if you are a film student... otherwise stick to Lynch's good movies like Mulholland Drive, The Straight Story, Wild At Heart, or (my favorite) Blue Velvet.  3/10. This is one bad movie. It was nothing. I can't see how some people think it's "visual art". Or that it "doesn't have to make sense." Or that it was a "masterpiece." I mean, if you're going to say that, you might as well call an Adam Sandler movie that. To quote a popular critic's review on this movie, "what you see is what you get." I didn't miss anything the first time; this is the movie: a timewaster.<br/><br/>The majority of this film is weirdness, and it's boring weirdness, nevertheless. Add on weak acting, poor editing, a cameraman who doesn't know what "stop, switch frame" means, and a script which sounds as if it were written by a Prozac junkie. Avoid this movie at all costs. This is without a doubt Lynch's weakest and laziest film. Following on from his excellent 'weird americana' trilogy (Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks, Wild At Heart) Lynch here adopts a style that refuses to get under the surface of the conflict between good and evil (his trademark 'primal instincts)', instead applying his 'bizarre' dream logic to events that take place in the narrative. As a result, twists and turns occur, and the film is at least unpredictable on first viewing, but after repeated viewings it's weaknesses are exposed (which is a problem, as Lynch films tend to 'grow' on you). The main problem is that so much of the narrative is dedicated to a twisty turny 'psychogenic fugue' (Lynch's interpretation of the film) and therefore characterisation becomes almost non existant. As a result, the film leaves you cold. The use of music too, is often so over elaborate one gets the feeling that Lynch became a hermit after the box office failure of Twin Peaks Fire Walk with Me (which quite simply is his greatest masterpiece and is on a par with Blue Velvet- worth another look) and reduced himself to a caffeine addict whilst discovering MTV. But the biggest problem is the fact that this does'nt feel like Lynch at all. It feels more like 'imitation David Lynch'- and resembles a cheap made for TV movie (the low budget really shows- Lynch had problems with the financing after FWWM) and if you did'nt know it was his film- you'd swear it was someone making a pale imitation of one of his films to broadcast specifically for channel 5. After the genuinly dark and unsettling experience of Fire Walk With Me (prime Lynch) this is a huge dissapointment, and if his fans appreciate it all too much, for once (which is often quite the opposite) they really don't get it.<br/><br/>****/10 Mmmmmmm... post-modernism. Here to save us from the Hollywood clichés. But I'd take Hollywood cliché over this any day. Because although this new cinematic method has brought us several gems, American Beauty, Fight Club, Resevior Dogs, it also brings us films such as this. Don't listen to the fans who will tell you how sophisticated and complex this is, because this is the cinematic equivalent of masturbation. Films can be sophisticated and complex without being as smart-alecky as this one, which undermines everything that cinema is about. The video jacket states this can "never be explained, only interpreted". This is true, the film does have some interpretative significance, but really, we all know this is so introverted and pretentious, in the end its only about itself. Strange and extremely obtuse, this film is perfectly in line with Lynch's earlier films. Weird, strangely lit and at a first glance simply too strange for liking.<br/><br/>I didn't like it. Not only because it is so strange that the mystery becomes uninteresting, but also because Lynch's obsession with inexplicable violence and sex makes it just a tad too grotesque for me. The part where this guy gets snuffed by falling into the sharp corner of a table is really stupid, much like trying to kill someone by sticking him onto a stalactite (see my comments for "Cliffhanger") - it can't happen.<br/><br/>I've had it with Lynch, really. Twin Peaks was really good, and "Blue Velvet" worked out fine. But he's not really making any sense anymore. At least not to make an important impression. Dizzying film about a man (Bill Pullman) who experiences strange fantasies and tries to figure out what they all mean with Patricia Arquette tagging along down their lost highway.<br/><br/>A very strange film with vibes of "Jacob's Ladder" creeping in now and again. By the end of the film I hadn't figured out very much, and it's certainly not one for people who find art-house pictures boring. This movie doesn't always make much sense and is considerably long.<br/><br/>Still, I respect that--for the genre--it is made quite well. It's just not really my cup of tea, although fans of David Lynch or "Jacob's Ladder" may enjoy it. Come on guys (and girls) this is a muddled mess.<br/><br/>Let's see, How to Make a David Lynch Film.<br/><br/>First rip off parts of sound track from Koyaanisqatsi, Get Patricia Arquette nude and in Black bra and panties, yummy! Jar the camera and add psychedelic footage from the 60s. Copy bits of Lucky Number Slevin and Double Indemnity. Don't bother to edit. Make film long and boring.<br/><br/>At end of movie, audience members should say, "Thank God it's over". Lynch should stick with small independent films of say 20 minutes and emulate Kenneth Anger.<br/><br/>His daughter made a far more interesting, Surveillance.<br/><br/>If you watched Lost Highway several times you really need a life. Tried to keep an open mind going in but I didn't like it one bit.<br/><br/>People can try as much as they want to make sense of it and if that makes them happy, they can knock themselves out.<br/><br/>I get the impression people watch this film and pretend that it's deep because they don't understand it and they want to join the crowd that think it's the cat's bottom.<br/><br/>It reminds of crap art you see in newspaper stories where some "artist" splashes some paint on a canvas and cons, erm, I mean, sells it to some museum or sucker for 1 million dollars.<br/><br/>Sometimes what someone says is art is just crap and sometimes a movie that someone says is art is also just crap.<br/><br/>I thought this movie was crap. One could argue that with my summery/title of this comment i tried to point out that I thought this movie was touching like a piece of art painted on canvas. One could also argue that I meant to say that the movie was like a painting, but then a moving one in which the image displayed changed frame by frame. If I had stated what I just stated in a surrealistic writing style and had thrown in some nonexistent jargon, U might have had the idea I was actually talking about the resurrection of Christ or maybe about a guy who ordered the wrong hamburger but didn't get his money back. Confused? ...try this movie by Lynch and u might find me crystal clear.<br/><br/>There is absolutely no way to determine whether this was a good movie or that it wasn't, that's the problem with art. Personally I like my movies with some kind of served purpose, some hint of direction and most of all, with some closure.<br/><br/>I gave this flick a 3 because I simply didn't like it, it didn't do anything for me just like Fear and loathing in las Vegas didn't or Revolver by that guy Ritchy.<br/><br/>If u are the type that could care less about closure or purpose this movie may be appealing otherwise I suggest u go and see something different. I am a big supporter of Lynch's films - They overturn and sometimes mock Hollywood conventions.  Lynch's films are surreal, dark and never less than original.<br/><br/>However Lost Highway Sees Lynch at his least resonant, the subtlety that characterised Twin Peaks and Blue Velvet is gone . Instead we see Lynch back in Wild at Heart ground - in full overdrive, where it seemed to work in Wild at Heart it seems to work less here. The pacing of the film suffers  badly, mainly because Lynch is at his most ambitious, changing lead actors half way through.  Unfortunetly there is little or no humour or light touches to let up the assault, Lynch throws us so hard into his dark territory that his handling is akin to mind rape.<br/><br/>This film sees Lynch at his most far out - while a universal idea seems to be apparent in most of his films (Eraserhead - Paranoia, Blue Velvet - Pulling the surface back), Lost Highway just seems to be a descent into darkness without any real centrifugal point and as such although by far the strangest it is by far the least interesting of Lynch's films.<br/><br/>However by not his but typical film standards this does have a right to be seen, some great scenes take place in the film - the hideous little man talking to himself on the mobile phone being one.  The film does have those touches of Lynchs surreal genius but as a whole this mega - ambitious film just fails to work. At least the music was great. Nine Inch Nails and Marilyn Manson are awesome. Trent Reznor did a great job with the soundtrack. The movie is just too out there. Falls from grace are hard to watch. After an amazing run of films (Blue Velvet, Wild at Heart, and Fire Walk With Me), Lynch unleashed his worst creation yet on an unsuspecting public. And yet Lost Highway should have been his pinnacle! Bill Pullman! Robert Loggia! Robert Blake as the Devil (sort of)! Balthazar Getty! Patricia Arquette! What a cast and what an intriguing premise--man maybe kills his wife who may not actually be dead but then becomes someone else in prison. It's like Hitchcock and Luis Bunuel made a movie together. <br/><br/>But Lost Highway doesn't even come close to living up to expectations. Why? Simply put: It's soulless. It honestly feels as though Lynch was going through the motions, picking up ideas from his past films and putting them to use in a different setting. He aims for a convoluted narrative and gets it; he searches the dream world for inspiration but comes up wanting. The story, with its dichotomous nature, should work better than it does, but the use of the two leads doesn't really add anything to the film. And, frankly, Bergman did the two actors as the same character thing better in Persona. And Hitchcock's Vertigo gives you a better I thought you were dead woman than Lost Highway. Most of Lynch's films play with conventions and ideas that are clearly connected to earlier films; Lost Highway feels derivative. <br/><br/>The best part of the film, from my perspective, is the thoroughly creepy Robert Blake. Lynch's films inevitably have great bogeymen and the Blake character is no exception. He's eerie and frightening. I was 17 when I saw this film in 1997 and I had nightmares. The rest of the film pales (no pun intended) in comparison to Blake. <br/><br/>However, here's the caveat: Watch this movie. If you've never seen a Lynch film, don't start here. If you like the man's work, though, make sure you see it. It's a polarizing film and one that certain people actually like. It's also definitely better a fascinating trainwreck of a picture. Give me a bowl of Frosted Flakes, a pink poodle and a video camera, and I'll make a better movie for you.  Lost Highway should have been lost on the shelf.  The last (and only) good thing that David Lynch did was Twin Peaks. He should spend his time trying to revive that, and quit wasting film with this garbage. ok, Dune was cool, but that was when lynch was under some creative guidelines, but when he gets to roam free like this the result is not good. Lynch seems to put the story second and acting fruity weird first. In an attempt to confuse viewers he puts stuff in and seems to think about thie meanings later( Like after the film is out) then he says "it's symbolic" Yeah symbolic of you being a dork Dave.. Anyway he tries to give a performance of natural weirdness (a good thing) like Terry Gilliam or to some extent kubrick, but this boy can't pull it off. All of his movies come off as forced and they seem to go no where. At the end of this movie you'll say "What the hell was that" or "There's 2 hours I'll never have back". Don't get me wrong, I love weird movies but Lynch is to weird what a man in a horse suit is to the actual horse. Yawn! How utterly booooring and completely point and plotless can a film be?<br/><br/>I tortured myself to sit through it until the final end, in order to be able to give a _fair_ judgment, which is that this film does not even deserve a positive rating in the mathematical sense of the word 'positive'.<br/><br/>"Lost Highway" is completely adrift, lacks any sense of direction, and is even worse than a really (and I mean really) bad "real" porn movie. I have _never_ given the rating I'm about to "award", but I guess there's a first time for everything.<br/><br/>PS: To all people who voted it at least a '6': could you _please_ provide me with 1 (yes, just _one_) reason why it should deserve such a rating --- I can give at least a dozen why it doesn't.<br/><br/>Rating from the Dutch judge: 1 (out of 10). Lost Highway is another weird movie of a weird director named David Lynch. Mr. Lynch really believes that a movie must be hard to follow and incompreensible in order to be a good movie. That's a wrong and old idea. Maybe Lost Highway can be interesting for silly enigma's buffs but that's all. The cast seems to be lost here in the same way you'll feel when you watch this senseless and boring misfire. After a great intro with flashy graphics the movie soon get´s stuck in an unbelievably slow, messy story about this saxophoneplayer and his wife, living in a haunted house. Obviously Lynch himself gets fed up with the story, so he alters the saxophoneplayer, who has ended up on deathrow for slaughtering his wife, into another character. Didn´t help much though, the pace is too slow, and the plot is just plain weird. I recommend "The Straight story" for those who´d like to watch a good Lynch movie. This was the first film which made me say 'What the hell am I watching?' Ever since watching Inception (a masterpiece), I got interested in watching confusing movies. So I Googled 'The most confusing movies ever'. In one of the results this film was ranked 3rd with the photo of that bloody mystery man with a camera in his hand. I was naturally interested. They even gave a synopsis of this movie. I got even more interested and finally I bought a CD.<br/><br/>Really, WHAT THE HELL WAS THE MOVIE ABOUT? First they show a husband and wife living a happy life. Then they start receiving mystery tapes that shows their house and they get a bit worried. They call the cops, but to hell with the cops. They don't seem to have an idea. Then, they go to a party and a pale faced, eyebrows-less, pants shittingly scary man (who is aptly called 'The mystery man') comes to the husband and says creepy dialogues like 'We have met before, haven't we?' Then the wife suddenly dies of no reason and the husband is put in a prison where he mysteriously turns into some other guy. The wife of the first guy suddenly becomes the mistress of a short tempered porn film maker. The new guy falls in love with this mistress. The mystery man calls this new guy and again says some creepy dialogues. The new guy and the mistress prepares to run away. Then they go to a very deserted place and start having sex. Suddenly the girl disappears and the new guy turns into the old guy. Mystery man again comes and you know... says some creepy thing. The old guy along with the mystery man kills the porno film maker. The old guy goes to his house and says through the intercom 'dick Laurent is dead' and speed off in a car and mysteriously turns into the new guy while the police chases him and the film abruptly ends.<br/><br/>Seriously, I don't get the universal appeal for this film. The only thing nice about this film is that whenever you are getting confused, boobs would appear on screen. I gave 1 star just for that. I didn't see anything else good in this dogshit.<br/><br/>If you are a person trying to find new ways to torture someone, please do make your victims watch this. They would really really really feel excruciating pain. Lynch used to make movies about the beauty in ugliness, but since Twin Peaks, that has all changed.  He pretends to do the same, but he casts his movies with Hot Young Things who sashay around in Neon Lighting - the ugliness in beauty, perhaps.  The characters show no life inside their skulls and as metaphors, they only qualify as Hot Young Things, but Lynch tries to use lighting and technique to divert the audience from this.  The movie works on a narrative conceit that is so boring it is hardly worth the effort - yeah yeah yeah, so Robert Blake stands in for the artist who is manipulating the characters.  Whatever.  Kurt Vonnegut did this better in his novels.  Thankfully, Lynch made The Straight Story next and perhaps will put this shallow piece of pandering behind him. This movie is a complete waste of time. The directing is the worst I've ever seen... Plot zero and acting below average. There is no meaning or even a reason to create something like this. Don't watch it even if you reach 98 years old. Quite mind bending, and to be quite honest nearly incomprehensible at times. In fact by the end I was almost completely baffled. So why would I rate it high enough to suggest that I enjoyed it? The reason is that I did enjoy it. Its bizzarness was entertaining. In the same way that the bizzarness of Mullholland Drive was entertaining. It's also deliciously spooky, and suspenseful. All I can say is that it held my interest, and left me charged up. This is one of the best psychological movies I've seen. Interesting chronology, not sure what's real what's not. Anyway the plot is so well made that you can interpretate it in many different ways and it makes sense whichever way you make it out to be.<br/><br/>This movie has a lot of celebrity cameos. A lot of fantastic licensed music which fit veryt well into the movie, the editing was on spot.<br/><br/>The only thing I don't like is the huge use of nudity, I understand it's supposed to show the strong sexuality, but you can do it without nudity too. Lynch is perverted as always haha. Excellent Movie. For me this is the best movie which works with dream psychology. It tells how people dreamed of the things they want but can't escape the reality. Director David Lynch is saying that you may blame others for your misfortune, but in the end you have to face the consequences.
Soundtrack played a vital role in this movie. Cast are brilliant, especially Robert Blake as mystery man. As a big fan of Mulholland Drive and Twin Peaks - The return, I expected so much of this but besides few memorable scenes, the movie didn't come up to the expectations. The story is build around same idea like Mulholland Drive but it just doesn't work that well. It doesn't have that many layers of story and emotions. Although, I must mention the scene with Mystery Man. I really felt chills when I saw that. Two hours of overrated nonsense and a mediocre pair of breasts. Don't waste your time with this garbage I only liked the middle part of the movie. Sorry David, this one wasn't my cup of tea. You lost me at highway. David Lynch is lazy and crazy. In all his movies, Lynch randomly films crapola. Lynch then randomly "edits" the crapola and passes it off as "art'.
Oh look everybody. Can you solve this "puzzle" ? I gave it one star because that is the lowest permissible.
Lost Highway is typical Lynch, boring, painfully dragging on and on until...nothing.
The only way he get's away with this nonsense is there are people, akin to the Emperor's parade spectators clapping and cheering bravo ! bravo !
Then they dutifully give the "auteur" 10 stars.
Investors bank on it. GIMMEABREAK ! Is this a low budget flick or what ???? Who ever had the idea for this movie has pure evil in mind or had a idea that they couldn't pull together worth a crap because its so hard to figure out that I had to watch a review on utube that explains the plot and after watching utube the movie made sinse then Listen, other than the relatively straight forward nature of Blue Velvet, I don't think I understand any of David Lynch's films. For some reason, I keep coming back and I think the fact that I don't follow the overarching message (if there is one), is what keeps them fresh and so "re-watchable." Lost Highway has been, and still is my favorite.<br/><br/>While I would never say Lynch makes horror films, I think he may have made one of the creepiest films I've seen with Lost Highway. As a fan of the horror genre I'm always looking for that next movie, or even moment on screen that gets under my skin. The opening act of Lost Highway and Robert Blake's performance still do that, about twenty years since the first time I saw this movie. Check it out! David Lynch - you either love his craziness and his movies that are quite out there or you are annoyed by them. I'm looking forward seeing Twin Peaks (plus the new show) the next couple of weeks. Annyone may need a second viewing or even more. There is so much hidden here, that you would be excused if you don't get everything.<br/><br/>Quite mixed up and really woven into a web of being nonlinear but also making sense in a way. Many character, many really good actors and a lot mingling (also lots of nudity, if you care one way or the other). Twisted mind? For sure it is. The question is if you want to go on this ride. If you do anything is possible - you might not believe what you are seeing or be unsure if you actually see what you are seeing. And what it all means ... again it boils down to multiple viewings ... if you liked it of course I didn't give it a half star because it had some good directing, style, tone. But in reality I really hated this movie because it makes zero sense and is terrible. "everyone interprets it differently"-kind of BS. based entirely in symbolism and metaphors. (1 viewing) His random collection of fever dream insanities rings much more aimless than in his best work, and the people who try to ascribe concrete meaning to it come off as pretentious as the movie itself. Still, there are plenty of creepy-cool visuals and engrossing weirdness to be found here: saxophone solo, coffee table death, Robert Loggia's roadside freak-out, and of course Gary Busey. Great visual aesthetics that create atmosphere and suspense. Highly irrational story that seems to lack meaning. Shallow characters with unconvincing relationships. This movie is only for the people that values art,..and confusion. I think this is more enigmatic than Primer Lost Highway is a perfect example of Lynch's "dream sequence" type films. The veil between past and present is very thin and creates a time loop where the pieces don't all fit together perfectly. Lynch explores a vast array of different sensory experiences ranging from strobe lights to a cacophony of chaotic jazz. This movie is a fantastic visual and audial experience. Not sure if this is thinly veiled pornography spun around a weirdly weak script or just a weirdly weak script padded out by some thinly veiled pornography! Like many, I choose to watch movies that have an IMDb score of 7 and above, I'd give it an 8 for the tits and bums and sex scenes, and 2 for the acting and 0 for the storyline, because there really isn't one. Viewers who know this to be a DavidLynch movie think it's great, but to me, as a movie, it's arty rubbish, and as an artistic statement, pretty dumb. Must admit, I didn't know anything about Lynch's movie style or reputation beforehand, but after this movie, I've learnt not to get too excited over any other Lynch movie. And as the old saying goes, I could have more fun and entertainment watching grass grow. This movie could be a cartoon, as it chops and changes time like a pair of sox, suspense yes, story no! Of course, amnesia is a good way to explain the inexplicable. Though it does have some Hollywood movie clichés, like Dumb (and sluttish) Blond, and even dumber (and 'pussy' struck) boyfriend who gets talked into murdering the blonde's boyfriend, and ending up in prison, but if you're expecting a movie, this is't one. Hi, Someone got impressed with this piece of turd? ME, yes, when I was a teen. Patricia Arquette was an awesome girl.<br/><br/>But 15 years later, this movie is looking terrible (in the US, it sucks).<br/><br/>The premise is stupid, the plot is boring (a bit twisted, but nothing out of the norm) and the girl is bad.<br/><br/>Speaking about the girl Patricia Arquette is not a star because she looks (is?) plain stupid in this movie (and Leaving Las Vegas if I'm not mistaken).<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, when I was a teen this movie impressed me, for its twisted story. But don't get me wrong, this movie is hapless entertainment (and lynch just go to porn).<br/><br/>Or Dune 2,... hmmm maybe not.<br/><br/>Si Cadaver Lost Highway is a film that broke most of the traditional rules of filmmaking, and if you don't appreciate it for that then you are a soulless monster. Lost Highway is not the first time David Lynch has broken the rules with traditional filmmaking, he did it before with such titles as "Eraserhead", "Blue Velvet", and several of his short films. What makes most of his films so great are the dream-like feel most of them have. His films are really an acquired taste, you really have to get used to his style before you get to like his movies. I started to watch his short films at the ripe age of thirteen, most of them really scared me at that age. I think the reason why I like most of his films and this one in particular, is how similar they are to my dreams. Most of my dreams have somewhat of a plot and in the end don't make sense to anyone else but me. Another element that is similar to my dreams is the whole changing character part (anyone who has seen Lost Highway will know what I mean). In most of my dreams I am never myself, I am usually some character I made up and doesn't exist in real life. If there was one thing I did not like about the movie, it would be the second half. The second half isn't as surreal or as interesting as the first half of the movie, but in the last ten minuets it all pays off. I would give Lost Highway and 8/10. Lynchian brilliance rules again and brings us his usual weired and fast/slow moving scenes.<br/><br/>The best David Lynch film I have seen so far, by quite a bit. It follows his usual weired style of filming and editing, with his usual stop start music. This film has by far the best story of his films and uses his style, to the best implementation. Normally I get a bit confused and a bit tired half way through so stop watching for a bit then to take them up later, with this I found none of this problem as it is interesting and the story is fulfilling throughout.furthermore this is Lynches best cast in a film, brilliant acting from all.<br/><br/>A definite see for all true foreign and weired film fans. This cryptic and dark thriller has to rank as one of David Lynch's best films. Its story of mixed identities sure doesn't follow a conventional narrative at all. In fact the film could be regarded as something as an early riff from the director before his masterpiece Mulholland Drive. Both films seem to be about jealousy, retribution and murder, as well as the darkness within somebody. They both also share a fractured narrative and a distinctive sinister neo-noir aesthetic. Except it's even harder to fathom Lost Highway and it certainly is more explicit both in terms of violence and sex. It explores Lynch's usual territory in that it resembles a nightmare. Dream logic is the only logic that applies. The director puts on screen some of his most memorable imagery here. And like always it is accompanied by a terrific soundtrack. It's an excellent combination of Angelo Badalamenti atmospherics and rock music. The latter varies considerably in tone from the raucous industrial-metal of Rammstien, latter day Lou Reed and the dream-like Song To The Siren by This Mortal Coil. The latter in particular suits the tone of Lynch perfectly – ambient, mysterious and beautiful.<br/><br/>The film is structured into three sections. The first part is like an extremely moody horror film that finds a cold couple begin to receive mysterious videotapes that become more and more disturbing. The whole idea revolving around the videotape is a quite brilliant one and just goes to show what a true original David Lynch actually is. The second part of the film finds identities switched via some kind of metamorphosis and the movie then becomes a crime-noir about a young mechanic, a femme fatale and a violent crime boss. The final part of the film brings things together in the desert and the Lost Highway hotel.<br/><br/>The acting personnel are mainly very good. Robert Loggia is very convincing as a sociopathic crime boss. Robert Blake is frankly unforgettable as the pale faced Mystery Man; his scene at the party where he confronts Bill Pullman's character and says 'we've met before' is a premier Lynch moment – it's simultaneously absurd and terrifying. Pullman and Balthazar Getty are good enough in their respective lead roles, even if Getty can be somewhat wooden at times. But Patricia Arquette, on the other hand is mesmerizing. She is perfect in her dual role and is outstandingly convincing as a femme fatale. It's a truly sexy performance from her, in what cannot have been an easy role. At one point she is forced to strip at gun point, while in another she appears in a porn movie. It's pretty edgy stuff and she is fantastic throughout the picture.<br/><br/>Ultimately Lost Highway is a very hard movie to completely decipher, and despite having seen it at least a half-a-dozen times over the years I am still not completely sure what it all means myself. I've read a few theories, and interesting though they are, I still remain not fully convinced. But the thing is that even though I cannot put all of the pieces together, I still have the urge to return to this highly compelling film. It's a bravura effort from Lynch and brilliantly combines violence, erotica and general weirdness into a very satisfying – if puzzling – whole. Lost Highway starts as Jazz saxophonist Fred Madison (Bill Pullman) & his wife Renee (Patricia Arquette) find an envelope on their front door steps, the tape show's footage of the couples house from the outside. The following day another tape is left outside their door which show's the house again but whoever filmed it going inside & filming them both asleep in bed, shocked Fred & Renee call the police who take note of the incident. After a party Fred finds a third tape that show's him standing over Renee's dead & bloodied body, Fred then abruptly wakes up to find himself sentenced to death for Renee's murder. While on death row Fred goes to sleep one night & inexplicably wakes up as a different person, a young car mechanic named Pete Dayton (Balthazar Getty), baffled the police let him go free to return to his life. However Pete has an affair with Alice Wakefield (Patricia Aquette), the girlfriend of a violent man named Mr. Eddy (Robert Loggia) but not all is as it seems in a bizarre world where anything can happen...<br/><br/>This French & American co-production was co-written & directed by cult director David Lynch & Lost Highway is as culty as any of his other films, after a five year absence from making films after the critical & financial failure of Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me (1992) he storms back onto the silver screen with yet another bizarre, surreal & often incomprehensible thriller that really has no logic or sense to it at all. To be fair to Lost Highway the first forty odd minutes are great, the deep mystery surrounding the videotapes, the murder of Renee, the strange little things that keep happening like the message telling Fred that 'Dick Laurent is dead' & the bizarre encounter with a creepy man at a party who seems able to be in two places at once but once Fred transforms into Pete the film never recovers from such an audacious & frankly odd moment. All the intriguing videotape & murder angle is abandoned completely & is frustratingly never explained, sure there are the odd character that is the same or the odd line of dialogue or the odd reference to what has gone before but for all intents & purposes Lost Highway completely changes it's main character's, it's location & it's entire plot about halfway through & it's a rather jarring experience. The boring romance between Pete & Alice had me wanting to know what happened to Fred & who killed his wife even more, sure Fred makes an appearance at the end but what actually happens during the final ten minutes or so is anyone's guess, quite simply it's incomprehensible & makes less than zero sense. There's a nice reference back to the opening scene but otherwise I was just baffled by the end like I am sure most people will be, Lost Highway just isn't that satisfying as it never delivers anything substantial or even concludes any of it's various plot lines. Lost Highway is a really strange film, it really does make no sense despite all the 'theories' that people have written & posted on the web, I suppose if you have to think about the symbolism & commentary too much like me then the film isn't clicking with you, to fully enjoy & appreciate a unique & different film like Lost Highway it's messages & parallels should be obvious & instinctive so maybe if you have to think about it too much it didn't work for you as well as maybe it might other's. At over two hours long Lost Highway is sometimes a slog to get through but I always found it fascinating & hoped that it would deliver on it's inventive build-up & narrative but it never does & it just fizzles out as it gets weirder & weirder as it loses all touch with reality & logic.<br/><br/>Lost Highway is a great looking & very stylish film, I can imagine a director like Lynch wanting everything perfect. Apparently Fred & Renee's house in the film is actually where Lynch was living at the time he made Lost Highway & which he designed, it's a very modern home with a slightly odd look & feel about it that sets you on edge & works in the film perfectly. Lynch has said the 'Dick Laurent is dead' incident actually happened to himself in real life, he also states that he was inspired by the O.J. Simpson trial while writing Lost Highway. For some odd reason although filmed & released in 1997 Lost Highway wasn't released on DVD in the US until 2008. There's a bit of violence & gore here, there's a nasty slit throat & a bit of blood splatter as a guy is impaled on a glass coffee table(!). There's a fair amount of sex & nudity too, Patricia Arquette strips a few times & there's a few sex scenes here.<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of about $15,000,000 this had quite a decent budget, it's extremely well made with striking production design & visuals. The acting is very good from a solid cast, Bill Pullman is great even if he gets to sit out the middle hour while Patricia Arquette is very sexy here, Robert Loggia & Robert Blake are both suitably creepy as the bad guy's.<br/><br/>Lost Highway is a film I enjoyed for hat it was, a collection of striking images & visuals randomly strewn together in a bizarre plot that made zero sense to me. Sure, you could say part of the fun & charm is coming up with your own theory & what Lost Highway actually means to you n a personal level but for me it meant nothing overall & I really don't want to be spending hours dissecting a film in some attempt to find the meaning of life or reality or whatever Lynch was aiming for. I just don't. Definitely one the my favorite movies ever. I have seen it quite a few times trying to see if there was sense in it for me. Let's say that getting this movie is still a project "under construction". <br/><br/>The atmosphere of the whole movie is, to me, really awesome and two scenes keep sending shivers down my spine. The first one is the love-making scene where the mystery man freakishly replaced the lovely Ms Arquette. Second is where he opens the door and Rammstein's music starts playing loudly. In these scenes it all just really fits together and you are really 100% focused on the movie. No daily worries somehow subconsciously still troubling you while watching, just attention to the movie. You can't always know what the other guy's thinking, but this seems to be the pivot point upon which David Lynch crafts his essentially noir tale of fractured identity and broken dreams.<br/><br/>Bill Pullman figures prominently in this film as a sax player who, through a particular psychological breakdown finds himself inside another man's world, feeling his feelings, and thinking his thoughts, many of which are of violent actions approaching murder.<br/><br/>To attempt any reductive rationale for the Lynchian style is to do a great injustice to both the director and viewer, since part of the dynamic of the film is based on our own perception of reality and how it is visualized in the film.<br/><br/>Watch the movie with glee, and a decent helping of sugar- it's a wild ride down a lost highway. I respect, if not always love, David Lynch. No one can pin him down and one of his charms is his versatility: beautiful, emotional movies like The Straight Story; complex thrillers like Blue Velvet; intriguing mysteries like Twin Peaks. Lost Highway displays the most famous aspect of his style: the surreal, nightmarish and the ambiguous.<br/><br/>Bill Pullman, in one of his finest performances, plays Fred Madison, a saxophonist who inexplicably kills his wife, Renee (played by the gorgeous Patricia Arquette). What happens next is left to the viewer to decide: Fred metamorphoses into young Pete Dayton, a mechanic who hangs around with gangsters and soon meets Alice (also played by Arquette).<br/><br/>Is Pete Dayton just a fantasy Fred created before sitting in the electric chair? Is it some afterlife where he can lead a new life? Or is Pete real? Lynch respects his viewers too much to give a straight answer; he must know by now the people who like his movies don't care much about answers and prefer the journey anyway.<br/><br/>Throughout this journey through Hell, Lynch is up to his usual tricks of strange set designs and of creaking noises to create tension. Fred's house is a dimly-lit, labyrinthine place where one could lose himself, literally and metaphorically. The scene in which Fred becomes Pete is disturbing but reminiscent of Jacob's Ladder.<br/><br/>And then there are the usual Lynch characters; two stand out: Mr. Eddy (Robert Loggia), a vicious, suave gangster who steals scenes with his hilarious brutality. And The Mystery Man (a chilling performance by Robert Blake in white make-up), an 'abstraction' as Lynch called it, a being who just moves in and out of the action at crucial moments, never on anyone's side, who seems able to read peoples' soul and induce dread. The spirit of guilt, the Devil, a loon, whatever he is, he's one of Lynch's most unsettling creations, up there with BOB and Frank Booth.<br/><br/>All in all, Lost Highway, co-written by Barry Gifford, is one of David Lynch's most interesting movies, a fascinating journey to the human psyche and beyond. Viewers who love the strange and the mysterious can't avoid this movie. I almost quit after the first 15 boring minutes, where the only interesting part is a sex scene. Initially the two main characters seem to be completely incapable of any joy at all, which is how the audience feels watching it. The movie caught my attention, however, when the main character changed into another person. After that, enough interesting stuff and abundant gratuitous sex and violence followed to keep me watching to the end. It should probably get a thumbs down for failing to make any sense or arrive at a conclusion that would neatly tie it all together. This is one movie, however, that is about the journey and not the destination. I feel a little cheated that this film has no rational explanation, but I have to admit that I enjoyed the ride. It makes less sense than even "Syriana", but is more enjoyable to watch. It is a comparable to Mulholland Drive, but at least that movie has a logical explanation and is a better film.<br/><br/>Syriana is a political thriller that is all style and no substance. Lost Highway is more of a psychological thriller with tons of style and just enough substance to keep us wondering. It is more like the porn version of psychological thrillers.<br/><br/>Robert Blake appears as a pale ghostly mystery man, and he very much seems like the devil. I can see no other explanation for his character.<br/><br/>Theories: 1. The characters are in hell or purgatory. 2. The characters are in hell on earth, which makes more sense. 3. This is what it is like to lose your soul. 4. This is what it is like to go insane. 5. This is a movie about the experience of watching movies. It doesn't have to make sense *************************************************** ***************************************************<br/><br/>Ever had one of those dreams that doesn't make sense, yet can be traced to events that have occurred during the day, all woven together?<br/><br/>Lost Highway reminds me of such dreams. It's a thriller having humour, mystery and suspense. It also has some satirical moments.<br/><br/>Overall - One man's thrilling dream or should that be another man's living nightmare<br/><br/>*************************************************** *************************************************** well, my advice is just enjoy how beautiful and sexy Arquette looks at this movie, enjoy the music, the art direction and yes, enjoy the violence and sex scenes, why not, if you like to watch heads smashed and sexy chicks wearing black lingerie. There is nothing more.David Linch is another smart guy from Hollywood who knows how to make a sexy, appealing and very commercial movie with a touch of art. And (why not, again) if you want to spend sometimes talking with your friends about what's going on in the movie, OK, have fun doing that, too. Who cares, anyways? My only real complaint is Lynch never pick a really handsome man as a main character. Only women. Hey, Dave, get us something to watch, too. if you want to force your mind you must watch this movie but it's a fact that you can't understand in first time maybe you feel sorry how i could not understand or you can think my İQ level is not enough for that!!! i can remember clearly in my first experience i could not understand anything this make me sorry because before i watched this film i think i am smart but after...<br/><br/>me and my friend argued about the film all the night and the day after the film however we could not reach a solution this was enough to make me crazy i could not sleep and i had nightmares about film especially about the man with no eyebrow... After watching Lost Highway I could only think about the creepy guy played by Robert Blake. I have read somewhere around here that he is thought to be a symbol of Fred's illness, however I think he represents Fred's "objective" memory and consciousness. Now, here comes the spoiler: He is the only character (or person in this planet besides Lynch) that seems to know what is going on in the movie. He is the man with the camera, he knows exactly what, where and how this nightmare develops; he knows the actual events and his appearance announces a metamorphosis. I mean, this mysterious man appears every time that Fred has a strong confrontation with reality and actual memories right before a crisis (like when he kills Renee, when he is sentenced to death and "disappears" from prison, and when he is running from the police at the end of the movie after having killed Andy and Mr. Ed, major spoiler, huh?). About Fred's Kafkian metamorphosis, it is never stated whether it is a product of his schizophrenia or a true part of the plot. In my opinion, it is the first option.<br/><br/>I'll try to briefly summarize the plot as I think I understood it: Renee met Andy in a desperate moment of her life. He told her about a job as a porn actress with Dick Laurent. Years later Renee married Fred, a man with schizophrenia. He somehow knew about Renee's former job and about Dick (and had some fantasies about her that are later shown in the movie when Alice tells Pete about the first time she met Dick and enjoyed it) although he tried to block it from his mind. He keeps repeating himself unconsciously that he must kill Dick (that explains his knowledge of Dick's death before it happens) and take revenge of Renee. Maybe those thoughts made it impossible for Fred to have a normal sexual life with her. Fred, when he is self-aware (deeply in touch with the mysterious guy), records tapes of his house as a way to communicate with his everyday self in an attempt to let his psycho instincts come to reality or probably to warn Renee. So, he kills her in a lapses. He is condemned to death; and escapes from prison in another lapses. Then he creates a fantasy in which he becomes Pete, a simple guy who has no idea about Fred's life. This part of the movie has all the characteristics of a dream, including the one of being able to invent every character's actions. Living that fantasy, he meets Alice, a blond Renee in whom Fred reflects his worst fantasies about her. Alice is a porn actress who knows Andy and works for Dick. Pete knows her through Dick and has sex with her several times. Dick gets jealous and threatens Pete. Alice tells Pete to run away with her. Dick calls Pete that very night and puts him in touch with the mysterious guy who is the contact between Pete and Fred as an "objective conscience". So Pete kills Andy accidentally (this death actually happens accidentally because it exists even after the fantasy is over) and goes away with Alice. They have sex and in the end she disappears. Also Pete vanishes and Fred is back in the game. In this part Lynch lets us see Fred's lapsus. He goes to Dick's and kills him. The police follows him through the highway and when Fred's lapsus is about to end bringing him back to his "memoryless" and repressive self, the movie ends.<br/><br/>This is my crazy interpretation. David Lynch is one of my favorite directors. I respect his work, and I am very much into surrealism and para-psychology. <br/><br/>However, what I didn't really like about the film was the lighting because more than half of the film is in real darkness, wherein active events are happening and I just can't see them. The film is interestingly written, but I didn't enjoy being a blind viewer at times. David seems to have understood that in his following mystery, Mulholland Drive, where it was technically flawless. It had very dark scenes, but they were well lit for cinema:<br/><br/>1) They could be scene. 2) They have an aesthetic quality. 3) They add meaning to the script and its enactment. 4) They create a mood. You're just sitting there, waiting, and waiting for something to happen. Dazed characters wander listlessly through the shadows. Now the camera is just sitting there on somebody's expressionless but dramatically lit face. There is no soundtrack. You can have a whole conversation about how bored you are while you wait. Then you realize what's happened: David Lynch and Jim Jarmusch have exchanged places. Jarmusch's formerly molasses-slow movies now bop along at a sprightly pace, while Lynch's have ground down to a glacial one. All this could have fit easily into one episode of "Silk Stalkings." Lost Highway is neither good nor bad in my opinion, visually it is stunning and like others have said the sound track is excellent and brilliantly placed in the film, but once again David Lynch has succeeded in isolating the viewer from the meaning of the film. Like I say this is neither positive or negative, but it is surely pretentious and 'cocky'. After saying that even when writing this, which started off in anger and confusion, LH has found a way to sink into my mind somehow and replay itself. i had exactly the same experience with Mulholland Drive, it frustrated me to a rare extent but I couldn't get it out of my head. i want to believe that Lynch follows his instincts when creating a film and that the gaps in plot and absurdity happen organically and are not contrived, for what would be the possible reason for frustrating an audience on purpose and with no resolution? Don't get me wrong I am not naive and i understand that this is of course part of the appeal for many of his fans, it just grates me, perhaps I am just annoyed that his films seem to pride themselves on having me not understand them and then tend to laugh in my face because I still love them! regardless I cling onto the hope that we are experiencing certain aspects of the plot at the same level as him, for if he is not also denied access to meaning then he must think himself above his audience and i believe that would make him a childish, spiteful film maker. Starts slow, gets better, if you are into that kind of thing.  As with so much of David Lynches work one is often left with a feeling of, `what was that?'  Case in point is Berretta Satan or an Alien Shape changer or just a figment of everybody's imagination?  And the movie within a movie, how could they make something so beautiful look so plain?  And room 26, what was that? Time travel?  Video making the unreal real?  What?  That being said, Alls I can say rilly is WoW!  Never have I wanted a DVD more.  The VHS tape I was lucky enough to get a hold of was cheesey and worn.  If your mind is not yet frozen by years of TeeVee get this movie.  <br/><br/>O yeah.<br/><br/>Things I liked:  Skin  -  Barretta  -  The most uptight driver ever put on film  -  Shape shifting  -  Belief systems about awareness  -  reality of the late 20th century car lifestyle.<br/><br/>Things I had difficulty with:  Platform shoes  -  Pullman making everyone else look so good  -  The cops @ the final murder scene yanked me right out of the experience. I just finished watching this movie and WOW. That was one scary hellish ride. Glad to know that I'm not completely jaded when it comes to movies (as I've aged I've found my ability to give myself over to a film waning due to my 'maturity' and overt awareness of the fact that I am watching a movie).<br/><br/>Contrary to the people who believe Lynch merely trying to be weird, it seems possible to make sense of this film. Spoilers about to occur. This is just my interpretation, but I imagine 'Fred' or whoever he is sitting on deathrow in *extreme* denial about the murders he committed. He imagines himself to be 'Fred', ordinary jazz musician with a beautiful wife named Renee. Renee is cheating on him, and Fred tries to maintain the belief that he's in a normal relationship. When he makes love to her, however, her disinterest is so blatant that his psyche picks up on it -- in steps the face of his devil's advocate-conscience, Mystery Man. Meanwhile he gets these mysterious tapes (made by the Mystery Man), in which at first little happens but gradually Fred's denial breaks down and sees what Mystery Man has documented: Fred murders his wife in gruesome fashion. Fred dislikes Mystery Man, but the latter tells him, "You invited me. It is not my custom to go where I am not wanted."<br/><br/>The insane deathrow inmate actually has two fantasies. In the second one he reinvents himself into a young innocent mechanic named Pete. He also turns his disinterested brunette wife into a platinum blonde named Alice. Alice is Mr. Eddy's girl but she's secretly in love with Pete. Alice and Pete want to run away together. Naturally this fantasy breaks down too, in grand fashion.<br/><br/>Somewhere in the first half of the movie Fred says, "I like to remember things my own way." That's one way to put it, Fred. After all the memorable, imaginative films Lynch has made, I was quite excited to see Lost Highway...until I was actually watching it. Maybe it's because I had rather high expectations for Lynch, but this film just left me bored. There was nothing groundbreaking or impressive here, just the feeling that some one was trying execptionally hard to be weird, with no other guiding motives. It's as if someone was trying to emulate a Lynch film, without understanding what made Lynch films exceptional. Yes, Lost Highway had the trademark Lynch quirkiness and non-linearity (if that's a word), but that's all it had. It seemed like just an exercise in trying to be weird and freaky. I'm a big fan of weird and freaky, but Lost Highway had no art, no innovation. It reminded me of a teenager who dresses in all black and fishnets just to scare their parents... no substance, just shock value. (And little shock value at that.) While sitting through the first 30 minutes of Lost Highway I realized what I was in for;David Lynch at his most macabre,dark,and self-indulgent work I've seen.With "Blue Velvet" at least we saw some richer characterization with an innocent young couple,a mascocistic yet depressed woman,along with a madman - and an interesting story line.This film brings us nothing even close.Mr. lynch, albeit,a talented mind and a knack for giving the viewer something out of the ordinary,needs to focus more on who his characters are,develop a cohesive storyline,and still be weird!This film was the same thing as waking up from a nightmare where you don't remember who,what,when,where or why-it was just eerie and made no sense.You just go back to sleep.I felt I sat through an artist drawing the strangest picture he could,in his most macabre mood,tied me down and made me sit through it.This is an aweful film from a talented man. There's a train of thought that indecipherable films are the best because they have some hidden meaning(s) that makes them beyond the realm of understanding, hence being mysterious, hence being brilliant.  This is crap. And fortunately, so is this film which is not brilliant or mysterious but rather unintentionally funny, slow, and intentionally baffling.  The first 25 minutes of this film are so incredibly slow it's hard to look at them as nothing more than padding which is indeed odd because the movie is nearly two and a half hours long in the first place.  Of course, this is where most of the unintentional humor comes from, as the two actors (who I won't disgrace by mentioning by name) are forced to avoid any kind of human behavior and utter responses a good ten-fifteen seconds after the question is asked!<br/><br/>Why am I mentioning time so much in this review?  I witnessed this in a theater and it put me off of Lynch films.  And I liked Wild At Heart...fortunately, I still can watch that film and be enjoyed and not bored to death watching THIS.  Seriously, have you seen this played anywhere in the last few years?  It fell off the face of the Earth and for a good reason:  not even Patricia Arquette running around naked can save this train wreck.<br/><br/>So let me warn you:  avoid this film.  Seriously.  Go plant a tree.  Go for a walk.  But save yourself some time and some trouble and avoid this mess. This is the worst kind of art:  the kind that uses its pointlessness as a cloak to pretend it's great when in reality it's just a sign Lynch needed someone to reign in his unwatchable visions and an editor with enough guts to tell him to shelf this. A friend of mine had to watch this for a class because it was the teachers favorite movie. Must have been his favorite because he was the only one who understood it. I was lost, from the begining. The story moves forward and backward with the only shining moments for me being a scene with Marilyn Manson doing a porno movie, Frank Loggia pulling a tail  gater over and that coffee table death...(Gotta see it to know what I mean. Other than that, I pass. I had to read the reviews here just to figure out what the hell that was, I was supposed to be watching. I think you'd have to be a die-hard David Lynch fan with patience galore to get, and sit through, this one. I just watched it yesterday and I can barely piece together the plot- something about a video tape of a man killing his wife, and porn. I definitely don't recommend it. It's way too long, slow, and doesn't raise any thought provoking questions. It's not so much that it's bizarre, because such things should be expected from David Lynch, just that it makes no sense, however you look at it. Lynch was trying to give us something to think about, or to just to be entertained by, and he fails on both levels. Thumbs down. SPOILERS INCLUDED....WELL, MAYBE...<br/><br/>Someone please identify with me on this David Lynch film "Lost Highway". I have attempted to see this every time it comes on Cable-TV but I will always fall asleep! I never make it to the end awake...ever!<br/><br/>This is a very quiet film...and since it is, it always lulls me to sleep. What I gather from the film that I can stay up for is that there is a couple in a very strange house that live a very unsatisfying life, including their sex-life which is obviously bad. It seems as though all of their awful life within this house is caught on tape which someone leaves at the door. What I could also see was that the Mr. Pullman character murdered the Ms. Arquette character....or did he? Who knows, but he does go to jail and then violently turns into... young Mr. Getty who bares a striking resemblence to Mr. Pullman. <br/><br/>Now I like this change and of course Mr. Getty and his group of weird and wacky "group" but what does one have to do with the other?!?!? Ah, there's the lynch in David Lynch's work. And its all being done very quietly.... But let me review the one part of the film that is the funniest and best....the part that I love the most is when Mr. Getty and Mr. Loggia go on that Mercedes Benz drive. I'm telling ya, that little scene is the best part of the film.<br/><br/>After that, I kinda fall into a deep sleep. Granted, I'm dozing off and on throughout, but after the Mercedes Benz scene, I'm actually falling asleep! I'm not writing this to down this David Lynch film, I think the film is supposed to do that. It's a very quiet film, very disturbing and very much of a puzzle. But don't ask me about the ending and whether not it all fits together because I don't stay awake long enough to get that far. I'm asleep.<br/><br/>Which is where I really believe the movie wants you to be in to begin with. Ah, the memories. I saw a promo for this movie once, and sort of put it out of my mind. When it came out on video, I was a freshman in High School, and a Rammstein fan (When people ask me about that, I vehemently deny it). I heard they did music for this movie, so I was like "I'm there" and rented it. As cool as it was to see some nude Rosanna Arquette flesh, even that could not save this movie. When asked of my opinion of the worst movie of all time, without hesitation I volunteer "Lost Highway". This movie has become a cult favorite amongst people who want so desperately to be deep. I'll never forget staring at the credits, knowing that I had become stupider by actually watching this movie to completion. Maybe I had Blair Witch syndrome (if I watch long enough, maybe something cool will happen!), I sat there until the end. Indeed, Bill Pullman is a heavy duty actor, and has been in some pretty rock and roll movies. However, as it is in the lives of everyone, everyone has a sucky job down the line. Thus, I can liken his agreement to star in this movie to my working 7 months in a Phoeniz, AZ convenience store. We all have that lapse sometime, and I will sternly warn against having the lapse in judgement to desire renting this movie! Please, I implore you, rent something good instead of Lost Highway, a movie not even fit to clean my behind when the paper runs out in the bathroom. David Lynch is known for his abstraction, dealing with imagery more than plotline, directing characters to act as their id. In that sense, this movie follows his other films stylistically. However, some sort of behavior or theme must tie everything together to make the movie cohesive and watch-able. Unfortunately, Lynch tries too hard in Lost Highway to throw strange, disconcerting images towards the viewer.  Although the scenes are somewhat interesting, the movie contains so much garbled dialogue and plot that it becomes bewildering. The viewer is preoccupied too much with just happened in the past scene to concern themselves with the contents of the current scene. Since the imagery used is neither lush nor as well-developed as in his other movies, after a while one feels no point in paying attention anymore.  I would suggest picking up the soundtrack instead; it contains some innovative jazz work and isn't laden with disassociative imagery. About halfway through the film, I came to the conclusion that David Lynch's feelings for his characters ranged from indifference to contempt, and as the film continued, I became more certain of my conclusion. <br/><br/>
While I found all the incidentals of the movie--the art direction, the lighting, the cinematography--to be intermittenly arresting, I found Lynch's attitude to his characters to leave me ultimately uninterested in their fate.<br/><br/>I, therefore, give this movie a six and recommend to anyone who's trying to decide between watching this one or "Mulholland Drive" to go with the latter in a heartbeat. If you have seen Mulholland Drive, don't bother seeing Lost Highway.  I say that as both a Bill Pullman fan and a D.Lynch fan.  If you want to see Pullman at his best, not to mention one of the great femme fatale renditions ever--by Linda Fiorentino, then see Last Seduction.  It is not that Lost Highway is so bad, it is sorta typical Lynch.  But the parallel dreamworld device is replayed in Mulholland Drive.......and M.Drive is more enjoyable. And M.D. has the far superior sex scenes.  Only the Robert Blake character is truly memorable from L.H. This film did not seem to make any sense to me.  The pattern or should I say "patterns" this film seems to follow are not glued together very well and the character development is practically zero.  I am surprised that the film would manage to even get the rating of 6.7 or even 5.0 for that matter. This movie was too long and vulgar for no good reason.  Mind you that their are times for vulgar and crude themes, (I.E. Usual Suspects and Pulp Fiction), but with a movie with such poor plot and character development, no reason. The ending could have come sooner by about an hour and the ending could have been more explosive.<br/><br/>Lynch builds you up throughout the entire film for a grand finale, but leaves you wondering how you ever managed to sit through this entire merry-go-round of a film. How did this film ever manage to get past script evaluation is beond me.  Oh well, I guess some have to fall through the cracks, after all, Lynch is only human.<br/><br/>Rating 4/10 I liked certain elements of the film.  As I was watching it, there were some cool concepts.  But, it's really not my style of film.  I spent some time trying to sort it all out, but its only guessing... Who will ever know what it all meant or what was really happening?  No ONE!  So you can develop your own theories if you're into that. As for me, I saw it once, I was mildly entertained, but I'll probably never watch it again... To understand this film one needs to appreciate a little film history. Maya Deren's "Meshes of the Afternoon" and the first 15 episodes of "Twin Peaks" will provide some insight but for the most part, view it with an open mind and understand that the person who thinks "Barbed Wire" is a good film is not going to like this. well, guess everything has already been said about Dave's masterpiece, right? wrong! every now and again i heard somebody say something about Mystery Man being the devil incarnate, but what i didn't hear, and however WANTED to hear was why they thought that. well, here's one answer for ya: the camera! he keeps taping everyone with his little (one of the first) camcorder. and according to some cultures, Camera's can capture people's souls! there ya have it, that's why Madison ran off when he pointed the damn thing at him. "And you? What the f**k's your name?" another thing on the Mystery Man: he IS Renee. well, don't you think it's obvious? everytime she disappears, he appears, she even wore his face in bed, damn it! and Renee, or Alison, or whatever only exist in Pete's world. as soon as Pete turns back into Fred, one of the chicks (the blonde) disappears and the brunette remains. the same with mister Eddy and Laurant. and here's another theory to support your DUALITY OF MAN theory: the difference between renee and Alison is black (hair, clothes, fingernails) and White (same), as in the symbol of D.O.M. -; The Yin Yan! there ya go, a brilliant plot in a nutshell, or whatever.<br/><br/>did anybody notice that all the TV screens are black and white? what is that about? and the old cars and cameras? i'm lost... What exactly is this movie about? I have just watched it for the first time and really can't tell you what the movie is about as it totally confused me. Even though I didn't know what was going on, I was often left in amazement at what I was watching. After I watched it I tried to work out what had just happened and what the movie was trying to say to me. I just got more confused to the point where I had trouble telling anyone what the main focus of the movie was. Even though I didn't know what was going on, what I knew was that I was thoroughly enjoying what I was watching.<br/><br/>It is the first David Lynch film that I've seen, and it has inspired me to check out some of his other movies. I can only hope they are as enjoyable, but a bit easier to understand. I recently read that this film made Entertainment Weekly's 25 scariest films of all time...and I would agree....partially.  If  you kept only the Bill Pullman/Robert Blake portions of the film, this could have been a fantastic short film.  Instead, you have a middle section that bogs down and has no relation to the Pullman story, which is by far the most interesting parts of the film.  Check it out only for those parts...plus the great scene with Blake/Pullman and the cellphone!! I'm surprised to read that so many people say they do not understand the plot of Lost Highway. On at least one level it is pretty clear to me: a man asks for the devil. Lynch gives his view of what happens if you do so. This is about the same theme as in `Twin peaks' (Devil comes to town). It is pretty easy to understand for me that if the devil comes to your town/house a lot of strange things will happen. When you read the things Jesus did/said when he was around this actually is a pretty simple movie. And a great movie too. Just because something doesn't make sense, it doesn't mean it's art. <br/><br/>
There's seems to be this trend in films, that if you make a film with lots of long slow scene's that have no point then it's a masterpiece and people should read such depth into them.  Well you're all being had.  See Casino, Pulp Fiction, Blue Velvet and Wild at Heart<br/><br/>BUTI have hated every DL film, with the exception of The Elephant Man', but for some strange reason I was in the right mood for this film.  If Patricia Arquette is anything like her character, Nicholas Cage, is a very lucky man, she was so sexy.<br/><br/>The film did surprisingly enthrall me to the end, but I don't see any point in trying to work out what was going on, as there was no point.<br/><br/>Overall, it's another Crash type movie, well made, and at least it tried to be different, but wasn't really that good. Realism was not the primary focus.  The images act as some form of artistic expression for the director, which are universal and mysterious...audiences interpret a wide variety of meanings to help make the experience less confusing for themselves.  Visually fantastic, and containing great dramatic value, yet it is so mysterious that many object to the whole concept. I can't believe I actually watched this piece of garbage to completion. What a waste of film stock. Although I can perhaps appreciate what Lynch was trying to do in theory, the resulting film is a totally unwatchable mishmash of the pointless and the mind-numbingly boring. I can't believe there are so many people who actually like this thing, and even call it the "best film ever" (!?!!?). It makes no sense from start to finish, the characters speak and act like they're in slow motion, countless shots consist only of a black screen and/or dead silence, oh, and did I mention that it makes no sense at all? This pretentious bore practically caused by physical pain as I watched it, in the hope that at least a few of the plot threads would come together. I'm here today to tell you that they don't and that there is no reason to even consider renting this movie.<br/><br/>I couldn't care less about these people or about what happens to them, even if the story had been even mildly comprehensible.<br/><br/>I'm all for movies intended to confuse and titillate the audience, but "Lost Highway" is the quintessential example of how not to make such a movie. The only good thing about it are the soundtrack songs by Smashing Pumpkins and Nine Inch Nails and the line "That's as smooth as s**t from a duck's a**." I will never watch another David Lynch movie, and unless you are some kind of masochist, you shouldn't either.<br/><br/>*** "Two Thumbs Down!" -- Richly Deserved Siskel and Ebert review actually used in print ads for "Lost Highway." Lynch intended the use of this quote as a way of inviting the audience to judge the movie for themselves, but in this case, you should definitely listen to Roger and Gene. *** This is one movie people will either love or hate. It's not Lynch's best work but it is certainly a movie hard to forget.<br/><br/>The plot will confuse people because that's probably the point. The questions it raises aren't meant to be answered. Overall is a creepy, sadistic and visually engaging experience. See it when you get sick of the standard Hollywood formulas. This is certainly not one of David Lynch's best films, and it's definitely not on my top ten... but like the reaction I saw to Reservoir Dogs (1/2 audience leaving during the "ear" scene), I am interested because it is striking a nerve below the surface.<br/><br/>First of all, I see two types of responses usually to this movie....the people who "don't get it", and the people who found it profound, yet can't seem to explain it, even remotely.<br/><br/>So here is my 2-bit psycho-babble attempt at aiding its understanding. Guy transforms in jail... ok.  Obviously the critical moment in the movie. It is fiction, stupid, so don't ask yourself how is this possible.  It just did, go with it.  Wifey is now a prostitute.  Hmmm.  Why is that significant?  Finally, if you can't see the O.J. connection in the final police chase scene, then you won't make any associations at all in this movie.<br/><br/>This is about MEN...their 2-sided, psychotic dilemma of sexual powerhouse jazzman cool rocker dude gas-station attendant/ and husband headhoncho controller filmographer pornographer voyeur driver detached artist... how else can I break it down.  It's the Madonna/Whore thing...except the schism is played out here to the point of insanity.<br/><br/>Bill Pullman is jealous, goes nuts, kills, then "escapes" fantasizing his sexy young alter-ego...but in reality never really transformed, in my humble opinion.  Very explanatory of O.J.'s motives, I believe.  He should be forced to watch this movie once a day for the rest of his life. David Lynch has become either a constant thrill or a total disappointment to the people who found beauty in his look at evil through a career of films like 'Blue velvet' and 'Wild at heart'. 'Lost Highway', written by Lynch and Barry Gifford(author of the novel 'Wild at heart'), makes an attempt at recreating cinema as well as David Lynch's place in it. The naive optimism and happiness that contrasted with the darkness in his earlier films is gone, and the focus is now solely on the weird and creepy. Lynch directs it like a set of music videos, and there are always songs or hissing drones and backward masked screaming in the air. As the film progresses, the  plot twists and turns in all directions, and you're bound to feel stomped on when you've seen it all for the first time. It's not boring, however, and with repeated views an interpretation will form in your mind. 'Lost Highway' is like a cloud though, meaning that it'll look different with every move of the focal point. While most of the actors do their jobs well, I would have preferred a replacement for Patricia Arquette, whose performance has a tendency to slow everything down at some critical points in the picture. Help!<br/><br/>I saw it... ...and I have no idea what happened?<br/><br/>I guess it is typical David Lynch?<br/><br/>Maybe I am just slow, but I need someone to PLEASE explain this film to me! Lost Highway..lost me...gave it a 6 because of excellent mood effects and acting.<br/><br/> This film was co-authored by the Director and another writer. Its almost as if one wanted to write a good old fashioned "thriller" and the other author a supernatural/cultish flick. Having seen several of Lynch's other films I was somewhat surprised to see this sci-fi-ish stuff introduced. Sorry folks, but can't give this a "highly recommended" to any of David Lynch's followers but it is worth a look if you are a fan of his. His lightening and mood effects are here...but its not "pure Lynch"..IMOHO. There is no excuse for taking over 2 hours of my life away with this movie. I'm not getting them back.<br/><br/>Ok, I know this was supposed to be artistic and probably meaningful in some way.  Speed it up a little Lynch.  I resisted temptation to hit the fast forward through the numerous stretches where absolutely nothing happened, and still the movie made no sense.  There is no coherent story.  My advice is to rent this movie and not return so that no unsuspecting fool comes across it.<br/><br/>Side note: the American public has done nothing to warrant unleashing Rammstein on them. Don't trust the previews when you see this movie. Talking about misinformation, bigtime. And there's a difference between "long, boring messes" and "deliberately paced art house films." Just because a film is slow and absurd does not make it an art house film. Something I missed? I think not...<br/><br/>As for Lynch, it's no wonder he takes these long breaks in between the movies he makes. When was the last time he made a movie? Exactly what Warhol did with the Campbell Soup cans. He's not trying to be an artist; he's a harebrained mastermind with the ability to fool yuppy artists and young cult movie buffs with his shocking and slight exasperations.<br/><br/>I could barely decipher a plot out of this. I'm assuming it was about a saxophonist who turns into this young auto mechanic, but there's more questions then answers. Like, how did he turn into this young auto mechanic in the first place? Why did his wife change? Why is there some hideous bald phantom making video tapes of them? and why...oh, forget it. There's no way these questions can be answered. Because if I asked those, I would also have to ask, "why was there a 15 second silent gap inbetween the character's dialogues?"<br/><br/>What a bad movie. David Lynch has some good credits under the wing, but was this a misfire. What an embarrassment. Expect nothing of it, ("Oh, it's a wierd David Lynch film. Just watch it.") and you will feel the same way. What was with this plot-less, melodramatic film?<br/><br/>I watched this film with 2 other friends, all three of us being in to exotic / alternative / independent films. But when it was over, not one of us could shed the slightest bit of light on what this film was driving at. Near as we could figure, there was some kind of Faustian deal-with-the-devil / punishment-for-sins deal going on. But that was the closest thing to a coherent synopsis anyone could muster.<br/><br/>Yes, some of the camera and lighting work was good, but you don't make a film just to show good camera work. That's like cooking a meal that tastes awful just to showcase the silverware.<br/><br/>Overall, I felt the film was overdone and self-aggrandizing. It's point (if it had one) was too obscure for it to be effective as art, and the plot was too disjointed to work as entertainment. It just exists for artsy types to feel deep. There is only one thing worse than being cornered by a friend who wants to tell you all about something sweet their three year old did yesterday and that's being cornered by a friend who wants to tell you about this weird dream they had last night. Sadly, you are shut out of the rapturous vision inside their heads so with arms flailing around in descriptive windmills, they fail to notice your eyes not so much glazing over as dropping out of their sockets and rolling into the gutter only to get stuck in the nostrils of Pennywise. A very Lynchian moment, for sure.<br/><br/>Here, the 'great' man gives you the inside the head bit but you remain unmoved due to the fact that Lynch is suffering from 'embarrassing dad syndrome'. You know, the one who turns up uninvited to your eighteenth birthday bash wearing an old eighties 'The Clash' T-shirt and combat trousers while ridiculing 'da kids' over their dress sense. He pretends to know all about that 'Marlon Manson' character while foolishly trying to dance to him and ends up drunk with his head in the toilet bowl. Lynch has no less subtle weapons of mass inaction. Cod-occult ramblings, Norman Rockwell/ Helmut Newton rip-offs and tedious not to mention twisted nods to kitsch Americana abound as does the inclusion of allegedly cutting edge music artists. Such as Lou Reed *giggle*. Yup, Lynch is one hip daddy-o messing with the heads of kids half his age. "Nice student movie, kiddo, but look at what daddy can do!" Cringe. Er, see you later, dad. But not before winding him up a little. "David, I think that garage mechanic part is crying out for Charlie Sheen in 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off' mode." Yeah, more like whimpering with bad breath. Ultimately, the only way to cure someone of 'embarrassing dad syndrome' is to sit him down on the old Bauhaus and have a little heart to heart. "David, you need to get out more as your not getting any younger and you weren't exactly blessed with a huge budget on your last stud...I mean, last movie. And you need to sort out this problem you've got with women. I mean, that attitude went out with the seventies. Have you tried talking to one? Yes, they have strange high pitched voices and disquieting differences in anatomy but once you get used to that you'll find it's as easy as falling off a log lady. You may find that they're not all suffering from such terminal low self esteem that they need to be serviced on all fours wearing a dog collar by an octogenarian screaming abuse and waving a silver hand gun. Okay, so they won't all look like Mamie Van Doren on steroids but they won't all hit you with a dismissive "you'll never have me" like they did in 'Lost Highway', either. You might actually find they have more than two brain cells to rub together. Also, you may be shocked to discover that they prefer to keep all their arms and legs fixed to their bodies in the bedroom. What do you say? David, will you just put the dwarf down for a second and listen, for crying out loud?" ***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me was largely incoherent and fell terribly flat at the end, but it had some memorable sequences and one brilliant one (the inaudible dialogue nightclub scene). Lost Highway is more of the same with less delivered.<br/><br/>(SPOILER: don't read on unless you've seen it.)<br/><br/>At bottom the film is a simple reworking of an old horror/fantasy concept: a hallucination of escape at the moment of death. Fred Madison is on death row for murdering his wife (presumably in a moment of insanity), and imagines himself turning into another person with another life, but in reality there's no escape. He changes back into himself and is electrocuted - in fact probably the whole thing has flashed through his mind in the moment the switch was pulled. It's a situation that has made for at least one classic horror movie (Carnival Of Souls), and there's no reason why it shouldn't be enjoyably revisited by film-makers who were willing to do an unpretentious genre piece. Here, however, it's tricked out with a mixture of long still shots, verbal pauses, arty compositions, fades to black, flashes of light and sudden cuts from noise to silence. The conventional stuff is quite shockingly lame. Vital plot points are barely introduced (for instance, the official inquiry when Madison is replaced in the death cell by his alternate self, Pete Dayton, who's then released: shouldn't we have seen some legal argument?) and some good players are given roles which leave them as little more than puppets. The only person who gets an actual character bit is the gang boss, Mr Eddy, in a scene where he and a couple of heavies commit some designer violence on a driver who's tailgated his Mercedes. Complete with overwritten profanity-laden dialogue, it feels embarrassingly like an imitation of Quentin Tarantino. Robert Blake has a sinister presence in old-queen makeup as the nameless 'mystery man' who acts as Madison's taunting guide along the road to destruction - but then you remember Dean Stockwell's sinister old queen in Blue Velvet. The whole thing feels like a student film, a feeling heightened by the presence (in sound and vision) of alternative-rock mediocrities like Henry Rollins, Marilyn Manson and Trent Reznor.<br/><br/>I haven't seen The Straight Story, but Lynch was desperately in need of a change. The 'weirdness' of his earlier work has had a remarkable influence on the cultural mainstream, but in Lost Highway it just feels played out. It's a common trend for Director's nowadays to just make up any kind of nonsense, say to their audience "make of it what you will" and the next thing you know you have everybody hailing the film as a masterpiece. Lost Highway is no masterpiece. It looks like the film was directed by a 16 year old heavy metal fan, breasts, violence and camera tricks are rife, but what does it all mean David? Great artists do let audiences read what they like into their work, but what Lynch seems to have missed is that great artists also know what their work is about. Lynch's view of directing is like stabbing a paintbrush at a canvas whilst blindfolded, messy and ultimately futile. I'm not going to talk about the plot, because there is none, and what little there is doesn't even make sense from a surrealism standpoint. None of the actors have a clue so why should we, that looks like Lynch's philosophy with this film. Pullman's basically a cardboard cut out, Arquette is only there to get her bits out every few minutes, and as for Getty well, the less said the better. A lot of people have hailed this film as a visual puzzle box, NO, Eraserhead (1976) was a visual puzzle box; Lost Highway is just plain stupid. Any monkey can shake a camera around. Thank god Lynch managed to pick up the pieces with The Straight Story, but please, no more of this rubbish. Instead of expanding his horizons, David Lynch decides to crank out another "kooky" product, one that his core audience is sure to lap up eagerly and without hesitation (or thought).  It's not that I don't "get it", it's just that what "it" is isn't enough.  Lynch is a mealy-mouthed fraud.  His fans should feel short-changed.  Is it any wonder Mulholland Drive was rejected by ABC?  I cannot imagine another Lynch series surviving on television even half as long as Twin Peaks.  Audiences are smarter these days. I'm disappointed with Lynch. I think he needs to start remembering that people actually pay money to watch his movies and that a movie is supposed to ENTERTAIN.<br/><br/>'The Elephant Man' is one of my favorite films of all time. Obviously I think Lynch is capable of producing great stuff. He is one of the best in the business when it comes down to the way a scene looks and feels. Maybe he should be a DoP.<br/><br/>At first I was sucked in by 'Lost Highway'. It was compelling but, in retrospect, that was all down to the atmosphere created by the sights and sounds. The argument that he leaves it up to the viewer to decide is a bit lame. Lynch is supposed to tell the story, not us.<br/><br/>All in all. Not a terrible movie, just short of the mark. C'mon Lynch, we're not all as pretentious as you! lynch, more than any other director i'm aware of, benefits from the gullibility and sheeplike nature of his audience. imagine a kubrick film with no plot or cohesion and you have a sense of a lynch film. there's nothing there. is that the joke? i don't consider spewing a jumble of bizarre characters and images onto film and releasing them in no particular order particularly creative or artful. not even in an ionesco absurdist way. this film is another loser from lynch. one some of your more unusual and over eager to be considered deep or hip friends rave about so you rent it and wonder what the hell they were thinking about. maybe they weren't. i know i wasn't when i watched it. I hated this movie.  I have never been subject to watching a director masturbate on film before.  This was the single most pompous, pretentious, overly "artsy" movie I have seen since "The Cook, The Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover", and I hated it almost as much as "The Cook..." I think "jacob's Ladder" did a much better job of "filming a nightmare", as was stated by a previous review.<br/><br/>There is nothing worse than watching Patricia Arquette trying to be DEEP.<br/><br/>I would rather sit through "Hercules in New York".<br/><br/>I know many many people that love this movie and not one of them can give me a reason.  I think it is because they feel that Lynch is a "genius" and that his B.S. fiolms must be masterpieces on account of that.  Not one person has given me a reason why they like it, besides "It was so beautifully filmed." Blah Blah Blah.  If movies are a storytelling medium than this film has decided to forego that and just show you style.  I will hate this for the rest of my life vehemently. There is no doubt that Lynch is an incomporable talent. Wild at heart is one of the greatest films of it's type ever made. But if he loses his sense of humour he can just look like a demented loon with a series of unpleasant fixations. Sadly Lost Highway steers clear of the offbeat humour that made "Twin Peaks" essential television viewing and instead becomes an unwatchable mess. People will tell you that you need to see it twice. You don't- thirty minutes is enough and then you go and do something worthwhile with your life. This movie made no sense to me what-so-ever.  I'm glad for all of you people who wrote a review and understood what was going on. I on the other hand didn't!  I can describe every seen that went on in full detail but if you ask me what it all meant, I'd just have to give you a blank look. <br/><br/>
Sorry, this movie sucked for me. I thought this movie was visually stunning, but what in God's name is going on?  Why is this film so confusing?  Is it deliberate, or is there some kind of metaphorical message about society?  I was totally confused, and I know that Lynch is a talented director, but this is a mess.  There was a lot of repetition of motifs, and I thought the colors were incredibly dull.  The narrative was lost, the colors were bland, and the dialogue was terrible. Go and take a film making class, Mr. Lynch! Rating: 6/10 Ok, so after reading some of these reviews I think I might understand the movie now.  Maybe.<br/><br/>I learned about this movie from a couple of friends who had the soundtrack with the Nine Inch Nails song "The Perfect Drug" on it, so I figured "hey, it'll be weird, but possibly good."  Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeell.....<br/><br/>The whole abstract plot really got on my nerves.  I'm sorry, but isn't movie-making for the purpose of entertainment?  Rather than, say, to stick your nose up at people who didn't understand the totally messed-up story that had no explanations whatsoever of what is going on, so if we don't know about damn "fugue states" we're basically lost from the start.<br/><br/>When you TRY oh so hard to make a cinematic masterpiece, usually you fall flat on your face and look like an idiot.  That's what I got from this movie... no altered ways of looking at life, no renewed appreciation of road-rage and strange men dressed in black with camcorders, and no understanding of what was going on!!  After a while I just continued watching the movie in hopes that it would all come together....and after that hope started failing I watched it just to see where "The Perfect Drug" was played... and I missed it while I was probably in the john during a commercial break!  GRRR<br/><br/>On the whole, I thoroughly do NOT recommend this movie, because it is just far too confusing for such a simpleton as myself, I suppose.  It was "too deep" and so "cerebral that it was over my head," according to these stuffy folks.<br/><br/>I have a suggestion: get your heads out of your butts and stop tagging people as dense just because they couldn't understand such a confusing and pointless movie as "Lost Highway." "Eraserhead" was certainly not for everyone, but it didn't pretend to be anything more than, as Lynch put it, " a dream of dark and troubling things." "Lost highway" doesn't have that excuse. Allegedly there's some mystery Lynch is presenting for us in this movie for us to figure. Sorry folks, but I'm POSSITIVE it ain't there. "Lost Highway" is just an excuse to show some bizzare and compelling images. THAT'S IT!<br/><br/>I would LOVE to have a one-on-one conversation with anybody closely associated with "Highway", particular Bill Pullman or Patricia Arquette, and ask them what they think this movie's about. I love bizzare, twisted, even cryptic  movies if it's really giving the people something to think about, ( 2001, Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer and Bad Lieutenant for example ) but there's nuthin' to ponder here except why am I wasteing time with this movie when there's other, genuine mysteries to solve. Keeping in mind that Lynch started work on "Eraserhead" in '72 and delivered "Lost Highway" in '97, the latter can be seen as an overview of "25 years David Lynch", and I guess the film works best when seen in such light: 1. We've got a confused, silent leading character as in "Eraserhead". 2. The production design of "Blue Velvet" (Fred Madison's house looking almost the same as Dorothy Vallen's apartment) 3. The switching personalities and a mystery man straight out of "Twin Peaks". 4. The lovers-on-the-run storyline from "Wild At Heart".<br/><br/>I thought the first half with the mysterious videotapes was pro- mising. A bit too slow, perhaps, but otherwise pure neo-Hitchock. Alas, the films changes direction after an hour and it struck me as five or six storylines having gone through a mangler and a compactor. I liked the movie and think Lynch wasn't lying when he said the mystery can be solved (hell, defending the movie I wrote a 'consistent theory' when some friends told me they believed this movie was weirdness for the sake of weirdness), but he and co-writer Barry Gifford DO ask an awful lot from their audience. The fact that the original three hour cut had to be brought back to 2hrs and 15 minutes, doesn't help either. An interesting film and Lynch once again succeeds in creating an eerie atmosphere but it's way too self indulgent and humorless. All in all, I guess it's pretty save to say that this first-film-in-five-years is far from his best. Nevertheless, Lynch is one of few those filmmakers (the other ones -alive- being Joel Coen, Scorcese, Spielberg, and George Romero)who are incapable of making an uninteresting film. "Lost Highway" is David Lynch's best shot at a classic---great soundtrack, good lead actors (Pullman and Getty), outstanding female leads (Arquette and Gregson Wagner), and a gripping reference to film noir proper's final image, the "Kiss Me Deadly" beach shack entering into combustion.<br/><br/>It would be a classic, but then, there's this little thing called "plot". As is, "Lost Highway" is enticing to watch, but each great scene has so little to do with what came before it that the end whole is less the sum of it's parts.<br/><br/>Arquette's undressing, Mr. Eddy's car chase, "you'll never have me", Getty waking up in the cell, Arquette and Pullman viewing the videotapes: these are all great pieces of filmmaking, but when throwing them together, you better make some kind of attempt at a continuous interpretation.<br/><br/>Mystery Man's omni-presence seems to be the glue for holding together the film, and all his stuff is very good. However, the film's ending, the car chase that clearly signals  Pullman/ Getty suffers in the electric chair for their murder or murders--this is the best route for reconciling the film.<br/><br/>Ultimately this attempt is very half-hearted.  A photograph double tying the two worlds is thrown in, lifted from "The Shining".  However, "The Shining" threw out a clear possibility that the Hotel was haunted, and "Lost Highway" veers more towards hallucination, though mental illness is haunting.  The Arquette "guy named Moke" story that is repeated in each world is vague, which seems to be the quality of reconciliation the filmmakers desire.<br/><br/>The ending and the devil characters' presence would seem to require more explanation of the 2 worlds, though this would've taken great effort, and would indeed be a different movie.<br/><br/>As is, 6 out of 10, too "abstract" for recommendation. This is style without substance.  And not even very impressive style, really.  Lynch seems to assume that overly long blacked out scenes are somehow sublime, and random plot devices that dissappear without leading anywhere are sublime.  Surrealism has never been so misinterpreted as a merely random series of images as it is in Lynch's later work.  And he is quickly losing the goodwill that he earned from the masterful Blue Velvet. The simplicity of story-telling is the best of David Lynch. There is nothing to be explained, there is everything to be amazed. For a good story you don't need an army of actors, just a few in the mysterious events - as in Lost Highway. As far as what this film means, I haven't the faintest clue. But it's so wonderfully crafted and often chilling that I have to rave about it. This is not a film that has scenes that flow together in any way that means anything, as far as I can tell, but visually and in terms of Lynch's use of sound and music it's remarkable. Basically it involves a jazz saxophonist (Bill Pullman) and his wife (Patricia Arquette) and the crazy stuff that begins to go down after the former finds a videotape of the outside of his house. He then finds a videotape that apparently shows a murder, and things get seriously confused for him and the rest of us. Some of the performances are great - especially Robert Loggia and Robert Blake. But this film is more about atmosphere than story. On the basis of that it's amazing. As narrative it's a mess, or at last a mess to those not named David Lynch, but that's not what counts here. The movie started out looking very interesting!  Then it became weird and weird and weird,  I didn't get it at all.  It made no sense.  I was hoping that in the end something anything would explain any of this, but it never did.  I guess maybe  I should have just looked deeper into it???? In Lost Highway, David Lynch returns to some of the things that worked so well for him in Blue Velvet in 1986. Unfortunately, he doesn't have a very good script here, and to make up for that he tries too hard to be mysterious and arty. The first part of the film plays like an experimental low budget amateur venture (although the acting is professional). The sets are too dark and the games with the lighting lead to nothing. The long takes on the faces of the actors add nothing, and the long time spent fading to black creates nothing more than a mood of impatience. The supernatural hooey is strictly grade "B." The barroom lighting in most of the interiors recalls the apartment in Blue Velvet, but the apartment in Blue Velvet worked well because of its lay out and how it was set up to work effectively in the plot of the movie. Here we just have a lot barroom lighting with little purpose.<br/><br/>Robert Blake, with his white clown face makeup as the "mystery man," expands on the cameo character of Dean Stockwell in Blue Velvet, but he is not so interesting as we eventually see he is another tired personification of some kind of Lucifer (yawn). Patricia Arquette plays the female sex animal as Isabella Rossilini did in Blue Velvet and she is as sexy as sexy can be, but not as interesting as Rossilini because she is a little too perfect physically, and too psychologically familiar. Lynch's idea that women are evil temptresses leading men astray is worked on here, but yields nothing new.<br/><br/>Main problem besides the script is Lynch has no Dennis Hopper. And he has no contrast. Laura Dern in Blue Velvet was a perfect foil to Rossilini, really etching their contrasting characters for us, but against Arquette plays only a variation of herself. Bill Pullman is good in a grim, spiritless role. Balthazar Getty, with more to do, does it very well.<br/><br/>The movie is also very poorly edited. A lot of the first half hour could have been profitably tossed. The film only gets going after the prison scene. (The "road rage" scene in the Hollywood Hills was good.) The desert scene where Arquette seems to turn into Blake was a wonderful opportunity lost. Instead of sex by the headlights of the Mustang in front of a dreary wooden structure (I don't think the crew got farther than Victorville) how about sex among the cacti in the blazing sun in front of something adobe? And the Lost Highway Hotel? Gee how did everybody end up there apropos nothing and without rhyme or reason? How convenient for the requisite gore to follow.<br/><br/>Lynch lost his way here as he self-indulged to overdose. It's a shame. He needs some new ideas.<br/><br/>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!" Get it at Amazon!) "Lost Highway" is a thrilling movie, about an insane killer (Pullman) and his personality problems, shown through different people in the movie.. The movie is a reconstruction of this killers mind.<br/><br/>This is truly a masterpiece. It is almost as good as the famous "Blue Velvet". It is not as personal.<br/><br/>I've seen the movie 7 times, and it is every bit as good each time. If you are in the mood for a 90's film noir, this is it. It has got it all.
