I am an 80 year old combat veteran (88th Inf. Div. Italy).<br/><br/>I watched BOB on the History Channel. I was so overwhelmed, indeed a bit panicked by the authentic nature of 90+% of the uniforms, signs, noises (I take exception to the sound of incoming artillery).<br/><br/>I cried several times at the authentic staging - for them and me.<br/><br/>I cannot believe I'll watch it again. It's too much. Too real.<br/><br/>We never had so much water allowed in a shower.<br/><br/>Rate: 10/10 I have read virtually all of Ambrose's WWII books, and this mini-series faithfully follows one of his best. The experience of these men of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne, was mirrored throughout the many divisions of Army and Marine ground troops in WWII. I feel that this series represents that collective experience in the finest, most forthright manner possible and pays tribute to them all. The acting, mostly by previously unheralded actors, was superb--particularly that of Damien Lewis (Capt.Winters). Winters had to mature along with his increasing command responsibilites, had to learn to turn over his initial company-level responsibilities to others as he was promoted to battalion commander.  It was clearly tough for him, particularly when he had to order attacks on heavily defended objectives, without being to lead his former command directly.   All of the characters were developed enough that you cared about each of them as individuals, and felt the loss of each of them through the attrition during the brutal fighting in the Northern European Theater. They cared for each other as fighting men do (confirmed by my own experience in the infantry in Vietnam), but at the same time they had to carry on with the mission regardless of loss.  Replacements are regarded warily at first, but then managed to blend in with the veterans if they showed they were worthy of joining this band of brothers.  The plot is real, and as such is neither macho nor macabre--it just is presented as it really happened.  The truths of combat are stranger than fiction.  The interviews with the actual veterans, interspersed throughout the series, added authenticity, verified what the series was showing. These representatives of "The Greatest Generation" did themselves and this nation proud. Though I knew the story well, I eagerly looked for to each new episode to see how well it tracked with the book and how well the actors and director portrayed it.  Up to this series, I had thought that "Once an Eagle" (starring Sam Elliot) was the best war series, but this one is now at the top of the class in my view. Band of Brothers finds us following the exploits of Easy Company throughout their campaign in Europe, from their inception all the way to the end of the war. The commentary from the actual soldiers that were in those situations is touching, to say the very least. These commentaries also help to move the character development along quite a bit, as it lets us into their own personal thoughts on the situations they faced. This project, to the best of my knowledge was undertaken at roughly the same time as Saving Private Ryan, using many of the same locations and also employing DreamWorks special effects, giving it a very familiar feel for anyone that has seen Private Ryan. As I've already touched on, the character development is greatly due to the fact that this story is not told in a two hour segment, but throughout several hour long intervals, giving us the chance to truly "get to know" the characters personalities as the story develops. In my humble opinion, the only other military type mini series' that even come close to the scope of this one are The Blue and The Grey, and North and South.<br/><br/>All of the actors in this series do and excellent job at playing the roles appropriately and making us believe the hell these men were put through. The thing I also appreciated about the cast is the lack of any "real" names, leading to us not knowing who may or may not be making it out the scenes alive and unscathed.<br/><br/>This mini series is everything Saving Private Ryan was, as well as everything it wasn't. If you're a fan of war time stories and "army" movies, this is hands down the best of the best I don't even think I could name ANY movies about WWII that could even compare to this one A bold statement, I know, but I'm making it any how. This week I saw three things based on WW-II novels. The first was 'The Pianist' about the Warsaw ghetto in the war and the survival of a Jewish pianist in that ghetto. The second was 'De Tweeling', a Dutch film about two twin-sisters, separated in 1926. One of them grows up in Nazi-Germany, the other in The Netherlands. That movie shows us more of the common persons during the war, Germans and not-Germans. The third was 'Band of Brothers', a true story about combat in the war. All three things are great, the films I mean, and you definitely should see all three of them.<br/><br/>'Band of Brothers' follows Easy-company from their training in England, through D-Day, the rest of France (including Bastogne), Holland (including operation Market Garden), Germany and Austria. This story is shown to us in ten different episodes. Every episode starts with the real men from Easy-company telling about their experiences and ends with a short written update of Easy-company. Between beginning and ending of episodes one of the best things I have seen on screen is presented to us.<br/><br/>The casting is amazing. Even David Schwimmer (from 'Friends') as the bitter Captain Sobel is great. Damian Lewis and Ron Livingston are superb as Major Winters and Captain Lewis Nixon. Every actor seems to be perfect for his character. The photography and direction is great also. I especially loved the direction of the episode done by executive producer Tom Hanks, possibly with some help from the other executive producer Steven Spielberg. 'Saving Private Ryan' was great for showing us the horror in combat, 'Band of Brothers' does the same thing but adds some other things. You really learn to know the characters (in 600 minutes you can do that), you sympathize with them.<br/><br/>If you have the chance to see this masterpiece, do so. It is long but you can spread the episodes over some days. But if you start watching it is very hard to stop. Definitely one of the best WW-II movies or series out there. There aren't much TV-series which have left such an impression on me as Band of Brothers did. From the moment I saw the first episodes, I knew I had to buy this on DVD.<br/><br/>This series, telling you the story of Easy Company of the US Army Airbourne Paratrooper division is so unbelievably realistic, so authentic... There has been put so much effort in taking care of all the details that it makes you believe that you are right in the middle of all the action. This is an outstanding achievement. It's about ten hours long, but I wouldn't mind if it was a few hours longer. <br/><br/>Each episode opens with interviews with several of the actual men from Easy Company, talking about some of the experiences that that episode deals with. When you buy the special edition DVD box (a metal case with 6 instead of 5 DVD's), you will find the complete interviews with these men on the extra DVD. These interviews certainly aren't to be missed! <br/><br/>As you may have guessed, I'm one of the biggest fans of this series. I could go on for hours about it, but our time is limited and instead of reading this you better watch the series yourself. According to me, there is only one score appropriate for a masterpiece like this one and that is 10/10. Amazing!!!! I didn't really want to comment on the show like others did, until it was actually concluded. Now that the show finished last night all I can think to say is Wow! This has truly been one of the best things I have ever seen produced for any format of entertainment, except novel since historian Stephen Ambrose fills in a lot more information that the series just couldn't handle. Every actor from Damian Lewis to the man who played Private Hall in the first episode performed admirably. Of special interest is Lewis who's character really matures as the show progresses, Ron Livingston who in episode nine loses some of the cockiness that his character Nixon exhibits throughout the show, Matthew Settle who plays the intimidating Capt. Ronald Speirs just seems to ooze the violent edge the character needs, and Donnie Wahlberg who unlike his brother seems to play more interesting characters. Also of special interest is David Schwimmer as Capt. Herbert Sobel. Even though the character is pretty much a piss ant, there is that one moment after he loses command of the company that you sort of feel sorry for him. Another plus is the production crew who really turned England into four different countries. No one place from  Carentan to Bastgone looks like the same country. Another plus is the special effects, which really shine in episode two and four. The night jump on Normandy with the flak exploding around planes and one plane bursting into flames looks as good as anything done for a major film. Also whoever thought of including snippets of interviews with real easy veterans definitely help set the tone for the episodes. A good choice in my opinion. If you haven't seen this show you owe it to yourself to watch any repeat. If you love informative movies about WWII by the DVD Set which will hopefully be released sometime soon. Another thing to note is the documentary which has interviews, film footage, and war time photos of the actuall easy company. I hope its as good as it looks. "Band of Brothers" in a word is awesome. I couldn't wait to see each episode. Co-Executive Produced by Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, it has the realism, look and feel of Spielberg's "Saving Private Ryan" (1998) but with more insight into the characters. Hanks even directed one episode himself.<br/><br/> Told over ten gut wrenching episodes, the story centers on a company of soldiers in the 101st American Airborne Division in WWII from their initial basic training to their landing in France on D-Day to their many battles and ordeals through to the liberation of a concentration camp and finally through to the end of the war.<br/><br/> The soldiers are ordinary people thrust into horrific situations and shows how each is able (or not able) to deal with the situations. The battle scenes are realistic and convincing and the special effects are breath taking. While the series depicts the trials and tribulations of the company, it isn't afraid to show how the war affects seemingly sane and rational men. For example there is a scene where the nominal hero of the story, Winters (Damien Lewis) shoots an unarmed German soldier out of frustration. There is also a scene where a group of German prisoners are cut down by an American officer after he had given them cigarettes. Even after the German surrender there are instances of out and out murder of Germans. This is very rare for an American war story.<br/><br/> The cast is of largely unknown actors, which makes for a more effective telling of the story. There is no John Wayne leading the troops to victory kind of thing. Damien Lewis is very good as Winters who rises through the ranks to lead the company. Ron Livingston plays his friend and second in command, Nixon. Others include David Schwimmer, excellent as the training officer, Scott Grimes as Malarkey the grizzled sergeant and ex New Boys on the Block member Donnie Wahlberg effective as Corporal Lipton.<br/><br/> "Band of Brothers" is a story that could only be told in a mini-series. It clearly shows that war really is hell. Band of Brothers shows the world the ugly truth of World War II.<br/><br/>As it was a TV series, sometimes people may think that there are movies of the same quality, but honestly, I didn't find.<br/><br/>The characters are presented very deeply and we can even feel what they are going through and the problems they are facing.<br/><br/>At times, distressing. Others, exciting.<br/><br/>I believe that as it was based on real facts and having testimonials from people who have gone through the war, Band of Brothers becomes unforgettable. Band of Brothers is a brilliant mini series about W.W. II.It tells the story of Easy company,a group of soldiers who fought in this terrible war.The first couple of episodes are about the drill of the men,the drill-sergeant is played by David"Ross from Friends"Schwimmer(not quite Full Metal Jacket).Then the company gets dropped on D-Day in Normandy where we follow their moves.The serie ends with an episode after the war when we see the company,or what is left of it,"relaxing" at a lake and thinking over this dreadful period. BoB is very realisticly filmed with great acting,although there are no big names in it.Maybe that is why it is so realistic. The series is produced by Tom Hanks(directed 1 episode) & Steven Spielberg,so it couldn't miss. And it doesn't,all 10 episodes are of very high quality,from the training in peaceful areas to a big shootout in the woods of Belgium and from fights in my own country Holland(with actual Dutch actors!) to a grueling episode about a concentration camp.<br/><br/>After Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan this is another realistic and good project from Spielberg and co. 10/10 I was a little hesitant to watch this miniseries because i'm not too fond of war movies, but this one was amazing! The acting was amazing, as well as the quality of picture. It was made to look like it was back in the 40's. It's not in black and white, but it has that older look. The actors, mostly British, are absolutely amazing. You really feel like you are there with them participating in the battles, feeling the pain of losing a comrade, and the fear of the battle. It starts with the basic training in Toccoa,Ga, and continues through Normandy, The battle of the Bulge, and Operation Market Garden, among others, as well as the liberation of a concentration camp. If you liked Saving Private Ryan, or even if you didn't, you will definitely love this miniseries!! Once again, Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg created a masterpiece! I absolutely love this miniseries.<br/><br/>As a keen amateur historian, I got sick and tired of books and documentaries about the great leaders, politics, geography and basically, the non-bloodshed parts of WW2.<br/><br/>Similarly virtually every time I saw a war movie, it was ruined by flashbacks( thin red line) ridiculous fiction (and yes, i do mean you, The Bunker) or completely unnecessary and out of place sex scenes (who can forget Enemy At The Gates, a powerful film, until that awful sex scene which ruined the whole thing?)<br/><br/>There are good war movies. But this stands out, because not only is there no fiction whatsoever, but because, as a miniseries, more time is available to get to know the characters, and follow their progress, to know them, to love them, to mourn them.<br/><br/>Time allows for detail, and the fact that the 'frills' that other films stick in to make them more viewer friendly and marketable have been left out....<br/><br/>When a character in BoB dies, you mourn not because a flashback tells you they have a young sweetheart or something...but because you know this is real, it happened. The acting is truly superb, and you realise, it isn't a character you are mourning at all, it's a real person. This is because the actors made very strong relationships with their real life surviving counterparts, they knew their roles inside out and it really does show. We feel so strongly for the characters because the actors have portrayed them so faithfully. There are no clichés, because the truth is so accurately reproduced.<br/><br/>After reading Ambrose's book, you realise how religiously each part of the series is portrayed. <br/><br/>The sets are perfect, the effects remarkable, and Michael Kamens score will go down as one of the finest ever written. Everything about the production of this series is phenomenal, the details are so minute yet so important.<br/><br/>This should be watched not just for entertainment value, but as a reminder of the sacrifices made for us. <br/><br/>Easily the best television series ever produced.<br/><br/>Watch it. Now. Judging by other comments, it seems that this miniseries struck a chord with many viewers. I almost hate to add yet another glowing endorsement since the other reviews are pretty much identical...but here goes. This one made me wonder WHERE DOES AMERICA GET SUCH MEN? The things that Easy Company (boy, there's irony for you!) went through. I've always been grateful to all those who fought for my freedom (I served my country but never had to fight) and have wondered how men could do the awful things that had to be done. I've admired those who actually faced combat. Anyway, Band of Brothers is superbly done historically correct documentary about E Co, 101st Airborne. It follows the lives (and sometimes deaths) of the men of Easy Co. The miniseries takes the men through most of their combat engagements. The cinematography is outstanding. Spielberg and Hanks really did a great job on this miniseries! There are some interviews with some of the survivors, who have remained close to this day. Disks 1-5 are the actual miniseries but WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T SKIP DISK 6! There is a lot of information about how the film was cast, the "boot camp" that the actors went through and how soft actors were turned into lean, hard fighting men. There are more interviews with surviving members of Easy Co. Folks, this is a don't-miss series! BAND OF BROTHERS <br/><br/>Aspect ratio: 1.78:1<br/><br/>Sound format: Dolby Digital<br/><br/>(10 episodes)<br/><br/>The trials and tribulations of Easy Company, 506th Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division, from the D-Day landings in Normandy to their capture of Hitler's Eagle's Nest in Austria at the end of World War II.<br/><br/>Co-produced by Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, HBO's epic 10-part miniseries (based on a terrific bestselling book by the late Stephen E. Ambrose) was the most expensive TV undertaking of its day, costing a massive $120 million to produce. And, as the old saying goes, every penny is up there on the screen. Borne from the success of Spielberg's SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (1998) - with which it shares a similar dramatic and visual style - BAND OF BROTHERS' recreation of a glorious (and hard-won) chapter in American history assumed an even greater patriotic significance during its initial US broadcast, when it coincided with the horrific events of September 2001. Written with economy and grace, and directed with emotional intensity by a series of directors (including Phil Alden Robinson, Richard Loncraine and Hanks himself) whose combined efforts achieve a genuine aesthetic uniformity, the movie is a masterpiece of storytelling and historical documentation. Punctuated by horrific battle sequences, in which the camera is placed within mere inches of the death and destruction, the film transcends its educational remit by focusing intently on the human cost of war. Almost every episode opens with testimony from surviving members of Easy Company (none of whom are identified until the end of the series), which further strengthens the emphasis which BAND OF BROTHERS - book and film - places on the bonds which drew them together in times of conflict. And, because it's a true story, there's no telling from one episode to the next which of the 'characters' will live or die, which makes it all the more potent and visceral.<br/><br/>The entire production represents quality writ large: Beautifully filmed on various European locations (including the UK and Austria), the movie is noble without being the least bit pompous or austere, and it manages to humanize a large cast of essential characters with small touches of humanity and humor, all of which serves to heighten the sense of terror as they descend into the maelstrom of conflict. The first - and longest - episode is deceptively staid, featuring David Schwimmer (a long way from TV's "Friends") as a cowardly, bullying commanding officer whose tyrannical methods nevertheless shaped Easy Company into a fighting force which eventually cut a swathe through the heart of occupied Europe. Brit actor Damian Lewis takes the spotlight thereafter as Easy Company's most respected platoon leader, with Ron Livingston as his right hand man. Other standout performances in a flawless cast include Matthew Settle as battle-hardened platoon leader Ronald Speirs whose wartime career was distinguished by numerous acts of bravery (fuelled by a unique - if morbid - personal philosophy), Shane Taylor as company medic Eugene Roe, Neal McDonough as 2nd lieutenant 'Buck' Compton (laid low by his horrific combat experiences), and Donnie Wahlberg as 1st sergeant C. Carwood Lipton, who maintained the morale of his fellow soldiers, even when the odds seemed stacked against them. Every episode has its merits, but stand-outs include David Leland's 'Bastogne' (ep. 6), which recounts the horrendous circumstances surrounding Easy Company's involvement in the Battle of the Bulge, and David Frankel's 'Why We Fight' (ep. 9), in which the full horror of the Nazi regime is uncovered in a German forest. Additionally, the closing moments of chapter 10 ('Points', directed by Mikael Salomon) are truly heartbreaking.<br/><br/>It's doubtful that a more fitting tribute to the men of Easy Company could have been devised than BAND OF BROTHERS, a truly remarkable film in every conceivable way. By turns engrossing, provocative and *deeply* moving, it stands as a testament to those who fought and died for our freedoms, almost a lifetime ago. Band of Brothers is the best Movie/Mega Mini series that has ever been made. It has all the production quality of Saving Private Ryan but with many more layers of plot and characters. I can't wait for the what has to be a gigantic DVD collection, just hope it is under $200!!! Thanks HBO!!!!!!! As near to perfection as a TV Series can be, I cannot put into words the gravity & importance of this series.<br/><br/>A true, accurate, beautiful, and brutal portrayal of war. Nothing compares in the modern age, if ever.<br/><br/>Episode 9 is so emotionally draining it is very hard to watch at times, but watch it you must.<br/><br/>Never Again must we let this happen. Never, ever, ever again.<br/><br/>From a UK viewer, my heart, soul and tears are with every allied veteran, and every jewish person (and others) tortured and murdered by the Nazi regime.<br/><br/>This is the best, Chernobyl second best. This is an incredibly poignant and important show that everyone should watch once. It's so real in the portrails of these men and women who lived through this war.
I've watched it a couple dozen times and I still get drawn into this story and am touched by the sacrifices so many people made.
Please show this to everyone you know. It's important to tell these stories that are becoming lost to time and history. It is so real that you feel you're there with these heroes in the war! What they did in Bastogne is unbelievable. Now that I've watched it, I feel that what we call problems are nothing. Evolution of Major Winters is amazing. The way he matured with getting more power to himself is really inspiring. This series, Saving Private Ryan and Dunkirk are things would wanna watch if you really wanna know what it means to go through war. Simply put this is a show every American should watch. It gives a near perfect representation of the heart, sacrifice, and courage that our soldiers had in World War II.
The production design is fantastic. The acting is phenomenal. The score is rousing and the direction is spot on. It's "Saving Private Ryan" but ten hours long and, honestly, better. It's a series that holds up nearly two decades later and will forever be among the greats that the small screen can produce. Even though I may not be an American, I am grateful for what these guys have done in Holland(Where I live mind you.) and how the liberated major cities like Eindhoven, Nijmegen and Arnhem.<br/><br/>This movie/piece deserves a full 10/10 from me, because this movie shows how people have really suffered in WWII, it may focus on Americans, but so what? This at least shows realism, instead of SPR(Which was also VERY good-don't get me wrong), but this just appeals more. It's a great piece of work, with much dedication put into it, especially the real interviews with the veterans at the beginning/end of a part. You don't just see American G.I's just storming Germans and winning, they were actually facing Elite Waffen SS and Panzer divisions, also of the SS. They have fought in Normandy in the midst of the misdrops. Getting massacred at Carentan, Fighting in Nuenen, Freezing in Bastogne. And above all getting even move casualties even after the war is over. This shows the drama what these soldiers have been through, from the training to the end.<br/><br/>No over-dramatised bleeding, killing and whatsoever, but real fragments which make you feel like you're in the midst of it.<br/><br/>Just the best war movie/piece ever. In some ways reviewing Band of Brothers ten years on is superfluous. Its already received every accolade possible and deservingly so. You would've needed to be living on Mars to not know that it is seriously good television.<br/><br/>Strangely for me, I have never watched the full series till recently. I can't fathom for the life of me why since my father was a WW2 veteran and I have an interest in the events.<br/><br/>I recently watched The Pacific series and unlike many I thought it was excellent. However, having now watched Band of Brothers in entirety I can see why some fans felt short changed by Pacific. The character development in Band of Brothers is first rate. Having watched Pacific three months back I have trouble recalling more than 4 or 5 characters. With BofB its full of interesting characters and leaves you wanting more information on all of them. Anyway, enough of the comparisons. The Pacific was an excellent production in its own right.<br/><br/>Band of Brothers succeeds on all levels. Whether capturing the realism of the battlefield action, the strength of the human spirit or the futility of war, BofB is a masterpiece on all levels.<br/><br/>Sure you could nitpick if you really wanted to. A piece of dialogue here or a small scene there but really why would you bother ?<br/><br/>Just embrace the series for what it is. A timeless memorial to thousands of gallant men and women and to a tragic time in human history.<br/><br/>And probably the greatest television series ever made. 10/10 The story of Easy company from the 101st airborne division of the U.S army is one story out of many to be brought to life in the screen. The tail of the young and brave soldiers who thought against the enemy and were dependent on each other, while the whole world depended on them. The mini series is one of the best series to have ever been made about world war 2. From the brilliant minds of Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks. I've watched the series 4 times and I was influenced by the stories I heard every time I saw the show. And really affected my point of view over the war and how much I appreciated the soldiers afterwards. My favorite character was Donald Malarkey, he was so emotional and compassionate towards his friends. A true hero. Richard d. Winters Was a true leader. I loved him really much. All characters were fantastic and I got attached to all of them. I loved seeing their stories end. Each character goes his own path and his story rounds up perfectly. The best sequence of the series is the one where all characters end their journey together at a baseball match between them. Although I agree with what Winters says at the end, "that a day doesn't pass by without him thinking about the young soldiers he fought with, who never got to see a world without war". It is an emotional story about brotherhood that gives you a sneak peek towards the lives of the young soldiers who thought to protect their country and the whole world. I loved seeing them in action and learned so much about them afterwards. To get it wrong, this is not simply the best mini series ever made, it's the best series based on war ever made. Period. Band of brothers is funny and heartbreaking at the same time. It relies on true emotions, relationships and characters, outlining a society in such a realistic and spontaneous way. The courage and strength of these men gives us a look at humanity at its best. This show is utterly amazing, and I attempt to rewatch the entire DVD series every few years. It kick started Damian Lewis's career and cemented many others with fine storytelling and camera work as well as background interviews from the actual people to secure the realism. I Always liked war stories , but this was different. This made you live the life of a army soldier fighting the WW II in Europe and taking it all to the Krauts . It is indeed an amazing experience.<br/><br/>It is quite heavy in certain places especially the scene where the easy company running into the foxhole in the battle of Bastogne.<br/><br/>It also showed how valuable is a human life and emotions which men undergo during long stints at enemy grounds.<br/><br/>I started to realise how fortunate I have been in my routine and normal life , sleeping in a cozy rug and taking a hot shower.<br/><br/>The scene where Dick Winters talks to Gomey and tells him that " we salute the ranks not the person". That made me realise that Army is all about ranks and the whole platoon follow and take orders all their time ! It's amazing !<br/><br/>Watch this splendid show, 10 episodes is quite heavy.<br/><br/>Band of brothers is a band where everyone is a hero ! Gonna watch it till I die, and keep on doing so after that How do we perpetuate the honor, the memory, and the lesson of the nameless and faceless thousands that fought and died for their country during World War II? To document WWII as mere history is to marginalize it as merely another fact on an eventual high school exam. To merely acknowledge that it was war merely because war is a terrible thing is to ignore its consequence, and its undeniable relevance to the lives of everyone that followed them.<br/><br/>To confer the proper deference to the death and honor of those uncounted soldiers, we must integrate into our souls the reality of living as their beneficiaries at the expense of their lives. While there is no absolute way to understand the cost of World War II, we can experience the barest shadow of its reality by seeing it through the eyes of those who fought it, who lived through it, who saw death on an unimaginable scale during it, and preserved a free world as a result. That shadow is a magnificent humility captured in a simply brilliant HBO miniseries, "Band of Brothers." "Brothers" sheds the narcissism of the television camera to bring you face-to-face with the dramatized-yet-real faces of the men of Easy Company, one of hundreds of American and allied forces to invade Europe in an effort to stem Nazi Germany's military machine. "Brothers" compels the viewer to see World War II on a personal level unmatched by virtually any other war production. You see not glorified geniuses of war, but hardened, otherwise average men, fearless and fearful, heroic and imperfect, lucky and unlucky, thrown into an incomprehensible maelstrom of war and savagery. They emerge not merely as a force that won a war, but one that established the foundation on which a generation's freedom was built, and through which the unspeakable savagery exacted on a race was exposed.<br/><br/>"Band of Brothers" isn't for the fainthearted. It offers an unapologetically graphic and frank depiction of war and the men who fight it, bringing home in a vivid and undeniable way. From the simplicity of the training centers to the brutality of near-abandonment in the forests of Bastogne under German siege, "Brothers" offers a lesson that should be mandatory for the eyes, hearts, and minds of those too young to know of World War II as anything other than an historical event, such that some measure of the price of freedom and the cost of tyranny can be interwoven into the souls of those who watch it. <br/><br/>To say "Band of Brothers" is merely extraordinary is to diminish its sheer greatness not merely as a work of television, but as a demonstration of freedom's 20th-century turning point.<br/><br/>To appreciate your freedom, and understand in an inherently deficient way its benefactors, "Band of Brothers" is simply not to be missed.<br/><br/>-David I think "Band of Brothers" is a true masterpiece in the history of motion picture. Not only because of its historical accuracy but also because of its presentation of humans in war. It takes its time to present life and death of soldiers in modern war. The action sequences are a major part but "Band of Brothers" true strength to me is the intense presentation of war's dullness, inhumanity and senselessness. It's finally the end of the discussion "Are there two genres - war-movie and anti-war-movie": As soon as war is realistically arranged there does not need to be an "anti-war-movie-genre any more.<br/><br/>All in all, this is not a series of movies but a complete movie on its own. <br/><br/>Recommended to all - especially those who still think there is such thing as SENSE IN WAR. <br/><br/>But finally IMDb leaves us with a secret: Well, why is this not listed in the IMDb #250?! It'd be #1. SPOILERS AHEAD!<br/><br/>What can I say, a brilliant series, which I will easily call the best series ever! Great acting, a great screenplay, fine camerawork, and of course with Speilberg a great recollection of the 1940's<br/><br/>Chapter 1: A Strong episode. Shows the tough sadistic training of Captain Sobel. Builds up all the characters and introduces them to the viewers. I really likes the fact that they made this one a NON COMBAT episode.<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>Chapter 2: A first look into battle with Easy Company. Focuses on Winters and shows his potential as a leader. It also shows the big failure of the jumps over normandy and what misorder it has caused.<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>Chapter 3: The most violent episode so far. Great battle scene in Carentan. It also takes time to show the soldiers after they get back to England, and for the ones that didnt. It forcuses on the horrors of war and sticks to Blithe to make that point.<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>Chapter 4: My least favorite episode. Simply a full combat chapter. It shows the failure of bad intellegence. Focuses on Bull Randelman that survives behind enemy lines. Nothing special in the episode though. (although it does show the Dutch reaction to the allied forces)<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>Chapter 5: I dunno why but a lot of people didnt like this chapter. I loved it! The great camerawork at the begining and the illusions Winter suffers throughout the episode really touched me. I also loved the full on assault on the SS Companies, and the change of command within E Company and 2nd Battalion.<br/><br/>
10/10<br/><br/>Chapter 6: Like others said, a special episode for the sole fact that it is the first time it is focused on the Medical Staff. I really likes Doc Roe, though I didnt think the relationship with nurse was usefull for the episode. I liked the way supplies were short, morale was low yet E company held on. The creators really tried to make us think how miserable they are, but to tell the truth after reading some books the matter was even MUCH MUCH worse, just look at a map of the battle of the bulge. Anyhow, great episode.<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>Chapter 7: My second favourite episode and by far the most violent in the series.<br/><br/>Forcuses on Lipton which tells the story of a bad leadership from Lt. Dike, and the morale problem it caused. Also it shows the accidental death of Hoobler. Really touching scene. The part which still echos in my head is definetly the mortar drop on Guarnere and Toye, and the reaction from Buck. Brilliant Scene. That goes as well for the Much and Penkala part. The new leader prooves himself on the first day with bravery and determination.<br/><br/>
10/10<br/><br/>Chapter 8: I liked this episode. Shows how the war was almost over yet the generals were looking for something to do. So they send out patrols. Focuses on Webster who missed Bastonge, and although he has been in the company since normandy, feels like an outsider. Sad part when Jackson dies from his own grenade.<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>Chapter 9: My favourite episode. The way they created the camps and its inhabiters was extrodinary and brought a tear to my eye! The looks on everyones faces when they saw it tells it all. Written briliantly, acted upon perfectly from everyone (liebgoot crying when he has to tell them to stay in the camps and not eat, Nixon when he first sees the camp.) Perfect Episode<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>Chapter 10: A great episode which basicly showed that altough the war was over, people were still dying. It also shows the absurd points system which caused a lot of tension within the soldiers. Finally shows the future of each surviving member of the company.<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>95/100 But then again you see names like Tom Hanks and Steven Ppielberg as the masterminds of this amazing production . Detailed choreography , detailed costumes , everything was there where they should be . It's like watching a really big well produced movie in 10 small pieces . Amazing , amazing , amazing .<br/><br/>The best TV show i have ever seen Band of Brothers is the best miniseries of all-time...period. Not only that but it's also among the very best war movies/tv shows ever! EVERY episode is riveting and the cast is absolutely amazing! It is a pulse-pounding accurate depiction of war that will keep you glued to each episode! Today I decided to revisit one of my most beloved series. As it's been a long time I rewatched the whole show, I decided to take a closer critical look at it. It's been almost 20 years since it was first released, back then TV shows were still the usual sitcoms. It was nothing that was taken too serious by critics, with exception of The Sopranos who was just getting started by then.<br/><br/>
I must say this show has aged very well. Back then, when I watched it, I had never seen something like this before. The messy shooting style was something I was blown away by. (still am by the way) Character development is almost perfect. Every actor is on point and is so believable, it's as if you are sharing a foxhole with them on their journey. Every episode is a chance to get to know another character, without ever losing the bigger picture. It has some of the best writing to date. It's easy to point out that it is a very patriotic view of American soldiers during WOII. And to a certain degree I agree. But if it is made and produced like this? Hell, I'll take it!<br/><br/>
"In thinking back on the days of Easy Company, I'm treasuring my remark to a grandson who asked, 'Grandpa, were you a hero in the war?'<br/><br/>'No,' I answered, 'but I served in a company of heroes.'"<br/><br/>Not an eye was dry in the room. Currahee! This series is way better than Saving Private Ryan (which is still a good movie btw.) For starters the series isn't fictitious and is based on the stories of men who served in easy company (a company apart of the 501st airborne that participated in D-day, Operation Market Garden, Bastogne, and etc.) Plus there are many likable characters played by great actors! This series is pays a great homage to those who fought in service to this nation in the ETO. It is full of accuracy, realistic depiction of war, and gives a good message of friendship and comradery especially during the harshest of times. Not to mention the musical score for this series is absolutely beautiful. What more masterpieces can Spielberg make along with Tom Hanks! I would like to recomend The Pacific which is also made by Stephen Spielberg and Tom Hanks. Though it may not be like Band of Brothers it's still a great series that depicts the Pacific Theater of War with great accuracy and much more gritty details of war. Both Band of Brothers and The Pacific pay great tribute to the men who fought and bled in defense of this country especially all over the globe. Sometimes the adr and spevial effect were a little offputting, but all in all its one of the best war madia out there. it is a little cheesy from time to time, but this seires paints the most complete picture of the war.<br/><br/>8/10: so far the best of its kind Yes, I said it. Why? Because this is a true story. It doesn't (unlike the inferior Pacific) hold back. The audience goes along with these men, learns about them and watches them as the go from training to victory. Brilliantly written, acted & directed, everyone from today's soft generation should have to watch this, and maybe they'll appreciate their life. when I aw Saving Private Ryan I thought it was really nice, but in general I thought it was too short, and the idea to rish a compagny's life for one person, really sounded too odd to me. Then year it however managed to runn off with all the important Academy Awards. Which was totally an unjustified reward in my eyes. Cos the other film Thin Red Line was alot more striking and realistic to my eyes than SPR.<br/><br/>Then in 2001, or actually already before the rumours started that Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg were working on a more detailed project about the European liberation of the Alied forces. This should be based on the book "Band Of Brothers" from Steven Ambrose. The result was a 10 hour long TV serie that could dive a bit deeper into several aspects of the liberation. Such as the training, Normany, Bastogne or Market Garden. The results are the most historical accurate projections ever to hit the TV screen. Here there are no heroes, peopler gett killed and often no coverage is done to show the most brutal parts of the war.<br/><br/>I went for the region 1 DVD and never saw the series on TV so I waited till I could see it on DVD. For 2 reasons. One for the Widescreen option and even more for the sound option. And this sound is thunderous. The R1 has a DTS option and I can recomand you to go for that one. Since the other reagions dont have this option. Also had this DVD got a field guide, maps, historical timelines and information, its really amazing and extremely far reaching. So the box really let you to teach anything about this moment in history.<br/><br/>
I think nothing can prepare you for what this serie is going to show you. I think the only option to get an idea is to look at this yourself. There will be passing bye many things that you will never ever forget. And cos of the shootingstyle and not to mention the thunderous sound, you will feel as if you are really there. Bullets flying all around your head, people getting killed everywhere. The effect is amazing and shocking. Its too bad that there are no Academy Awards for TV series, else they should give them all to this one.<br/><br/>I use this or parts of this series to sjow at my students in historyclass since its just so realistic and we'll done. I think that everybody should see this. Not just to get an idea of how brave these young Americans were but more cos no matter how arrogant these Americans are or willing to fight a war somewhere, this was a war that had to be fought and were them liberating Europe from a terrible tiranny so its something we should never forget. I've seen the entire mini-series 3 times and never tire of it. The realism of the battle scenes makes you feel as if you are embedded in the history. As a WW2 history buff, I am always intrigued by stories from this era. The fact that these were real people, adds much more to the overall story. Aside from the movie itself, I also appreciated seeing the interviews with the surviving heroes that appear before and after the various episodes. One episode that I would have liked to have scene would have been an "epilogue" of the veterans returning to the US and their experiences with assimilating back into society. For most, I'm sure that it was difficult after experiences the horror of war.<br/><br/>Great Job!!! My wife checked 'Band of Brothers' out from our local library (6 DVD set). I watched it all over three nights and then proceeded to repeat the process at a slower pace. I thought a bit about what it was that kept me transfixed. 'Historical interest? Am I enjoying seeing war in all it's horror? Do I like seeing death? Am I desensitizing myself to violence?' No, that wasn't it. What captivated my imagination was the fact that real people went through this. Real people found themselves in these situations and they had to deal with it. They had to trust there comrades. They had to find strength and courage beyond anything they had ever experienced. I like to think that those same qualities can be found in any man if he will acknowledge them. I have never been to war. I don't want to, and chances are I will never have to. But there has to be a way to live life with the same strength and courage. If you will let it, 'Band of Brothers' is one of those rare dramas that has the potential to pick you up by the scruff of the neck and tell you to wake up, stop whining, face your fears and your mess head on and get on with life. Stop indulging and start living. Roughly half way through and I'm lost in admiration for this quite exceptional series. I find some sequences hard to watch, I don't look forward to each episode in the same way I might for other TV shows. It's exhausting. This series goes far beyond normal TV fodder. It's mighty stuff: moving, rigorous, uncompromising and extraordinarily subtle, despite its epic scale. This almost semi-documentary has all the gritty realism of the D-Day-beginning of Saving Private Ryan without the much weaker and unnecessary melodramatic followings parts of SPR. Everything is believable, both sides are shown, nothing important is left out, being it the Nazi-crimes, war-crimes from all sides, the horror of being shelled or wounded, the breaking of men facing the terror of war, the thrill of fighting in a battle and the final horror of dying in battle, accidents or the ultimate horror of the concentration camps.<br/><br/>The special effects, editing, cast and directing are brilliant, above most motion pictures, but what really leaves you in awe is the feeling, that you are watching true events and that it must have felt like this, when Easy Company and all the other soldiers entered the hell that is war. <br/><br/>A masterpiece. Band of Brothers shows the world the ugly truth of World War II.<br/><br/>As it was a TV series, sometimes people may think that there are movies of the same quality, but honestly, I didn't find.<br/><br/>The characters are presented very deeply and we can even feel what they are going through and the problems they are facing.<br/><br/>At times, distressing. Others, exciting.<br/><br/>I believe that as it was based on real facts and having testimonials from people who have gone through the war, Band of Brothers becomes unforgettable. The best miniseries ever. This was my first series related to war and I'm not gonna lie I was hesitating a bit whether should I watch it or not. But, when I started watching it, I couldn't wait to watch more. Watch this. It's worth every minute. I know it is a series but the fact that you are getting a very close connection to the characters in that long time is the best aspect. If someone is dying, it hits you way harder than in a 2 hour movie. One of the best TV series on world war 2. Very beautiful directed and produced. Shows every aspect of world war 2. At first I thought it was just gonna be another simple ordinary war movie like other movies.....but i should literally say its one of the best best ever series that i have watched a long time....i would suggest each and every one of you to do must watch it atleast once in their lives. And i like this Series in the way they took each scenes in a most realistic manner......it just made me to think that i m actually living in a well sophisticated life where they people lived in a plight of the hell those days...and that is why i like it very much as at the end they made to make up our minds to believe war is not the one way to come over the hobble to curb the other in such a violence and agonising way.... through this Series i came to know how hard people fought against the central powers amid the bad weather and poor supplies of food and ammo...and make me feel all the soldier in the easy company were the real heroes of the world. I would like to make a big salute to the worrier with true respect. An amazing, emotional, action drama, documentary etc... the Band of brothers has it all! I can fully understand the very high overall rating here. Although my average rating for each single episode would lie somewhere around 8 stars only, as a whole, Band of Brothers is one of the must-see masterpieces! The whole show is absolutely amazing, some huge actors had their careers made off this series. Top class. If you really want to get inside a soldier's experience, this is it! Super realistic drama, feels like you are fighting alongside the principal actors of WWII Band of Brothers is one of my favorite show ever for several reasons.<br/><br/>First, it touches my heart so much. Especially when I hear the real heroes who inspired the show tell their stories to us, telling us how they felt when they were about to jump out of that airplane and engage themselves into something far greater than themselves. This brings so much authenticity to the show as you realize that what is shown in the series was their story. You realize the level of suffering and sacrifice they went through everyday, the fear to die at each second or losing your friend at any moment. I cried a lot watching it as my great grandfather landed on Omaha Beach on D-day and I could imagine now what he must have gone through. It makes me proud of him and his brothers so much.â™¥<br/><br/>Now most importantly this show is essential. As more and more of those anonymous heroes are joining their fallen brothers, Band of Brothers and its sequel The Pacific will always be there to remind us that we should learn from our mistakes so another generation would not have to sacrifice themselves to defeat Evil. In those days when we see a resurgence of Nazi ideologies in our streets, this show is definitely something we should preserve.<br/><br/>Finally I want to thank all those heroes for what they did, for freeing the world of Evil and sharing their stories to make that show possible. Thank you also Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg for honoring those heroes through your art. We need more people like you for sure. God Bless all of you. All good things about this TV smash hit has already been said by others on these pages. Its a top notch piece of TV entertainment and with some really good performances. As much as I loved this show, I also find it acceptable, that others might not share my enthusiasm - hail the freedom of speech. Now, when this is said, I dont really get, some of the arguments, used by the "cons" of this production e.g. that BOB depicts the Americans as the good guys once again, and hails American soldiers and that the war scenes are not realistic. First of all, this is an American production, as many of the greatest war movies are. Why shouldnt the Americans be allowed to honour and remember their soldiers and to tell a piece of their own history and legacy? This criticism has been brought up many times, also in connection to Saving Private Ryan, and frankly it make no sense to blame a nation to be most interested in their own history and people. Second I also have to question the complaints about the lack of realism. This is, even though it resembles reality a lot, fiction - and not a documentary. When you have a piece of fiction, you should be allowed to a certain amount of artistic freedom. This is not because I want to "approve" of twists of facts! Anyway, I would have greater understanding for the criticism if it had concerned the actual content, like bad acting, bad story line or something like that....... I won't go into detail as others have. This is the 2nd time I've watched this series and I felt obligated to leave a review finally. I'm rating it 10/10 but would do 100/100 if I could. The cast was spectacular and no one actor stole the acting spotlight, as the acting was so strong. I'm leaving it up to the visitors to watch and consider for themselves what to think. I'd suggest binge watching on Prime if you have it. If you're taking this country for granted. If you're thinking this country sucks for today's made up contrived 1,000 reasons. If you're wondering why this is the greatest Country in human history--watch the series. I'll bet you either breakdown or wonder why you've been cowed into thinking America is evil and why you've allowed yourself not to think for yourself.<br/><br/>Please watch and learn why this is the greatest country in history and stop taking it for granted. Then I'd urge you to catch up on our great history, not the one the political blue party wants you to believe (how utterly saddening). ... who form a cohesive "band" through training, D-Day, the invasion of Europe, the Battle of the Bulge, the end of the war, and what came afterwards. This is the true story of Richard Winters and his time in the 101st Airborne.<br/><br/>I love to see Robert Mitchum act and John Wayne perform as WWII soldiers in 40s, 50s, and 60s films, but they never were age appropriate for the roles of WWII soldiers. The actual WWII soldiers were largely fresh faced teenagers, usually drafted weeks after high school graduation, just like those shown in this mini-series. Just like my dad, who looks like a twelve year old in uniform in that 75 year old photo I have of him.<br/><br/>As well as the horrors of war and the sudden death of friends and colleagues, this series shows that what came before - training - and what came afterwards - waiting for a chance to go home while the soldiers have nothing but guns, alcohol, and time on their hands, often with deadly results.<br/><br/>A real surprise is David Schwimmer as an unhinged officer during basic training. If you are used to seeing Schwimmer as the erudite - if socially clueless to the point of being endearing - paleontologist on "Friends", then you will really be surprised by his performance here.<br/><br/>The ending tells what happened in peacetime to each of the surviving members of Easy Company, and the outcomes were as diverse as the individuals. Everything from handyman to executive, from long life to sudden death in an auto accident at a young age awaited the group back home.<br/><br/>Americans seem very divided today, with one group having no understanding or empathy with those who have viewpoints different from their own. I'm not saying we should reinstate the draft - somehow I think the rich would manage to exempt themselves if they wanted. But the randomness of that experience and having to work with and cooperate with all kinds of people really seemed to enrich the lives of people after they left the service.<br/><br/>One interesting point - The German general who is shown getting to speak to his troops before he is taken into custody by the Americans handed his revolver over to Dick Winters. Winters kept that revolver. It had never been fired. That one fact is never mentioned in the mini series because Winters said he did not want it mentioned. Maybe he figured it would make the Germans look too sympathetic.<br/><br/>I'd highly recommend this film to anyone who likes the high production values of HBO's productions. Best cast, action, story , acting, suspense, emotion, heroism and etc etc . you just can't forget this mini series . MASTERPIECE
currahee! I love this war series is the greatest war series in all time i love the the fight and the best thing on this series is the story it's based on real story of soldiers My ratings are based on rewatch ability. This story is top notch, but so sad and long depressing I can't watch it over and over. Nothing personal against it. This series is way better than Saving Private Ryan (which is still a good movie btw.) For starters the series isn't fictitious and is based on the stories of men who served in easy company (a company apart of the 501st airborne that participated in D-day, Operation Market Garden, Bastogne, and etc.) Plus there are many likable characters played by great actors! This series is pays a great homage to those who fought in service to this nation in the ETO. It is full of accuracy, realistic depiction of war, and gives a good message of friendship and comradery especially during the harshest of times. Not to mention the musical score for this series is absolutely beautiful. What more masterpieces can Spielberg make along with Tom Hanks! I would like to recomend The Pacific which is also made by Stephen Spielberg and Tom Hanks. Though it may not be like Band of Brothers it's still a great series that depicts the Pacific Theater of War with great accuracy and much more gritty details of war. Both Band of Brothers and The Pacific pay great tribute to the men who fought and bled in defense of this country especially all over the globe. While watching BOB it feels like as a viewer you're right there in the battle field. Portrayal of the camaraderie was astounding. Definitely worth 10hrs A harrowing, moving and immersive war drama.
Full heart-stoping battle sequences, a great cast of characters and amazing performances. Throughout the series you build a strong connection to Easy Company and you care and are eager to find out how they end up. At some parts dialog and non-actions scenes drag on for a little too long, especially in the long episodes, however it makes up for it by providing amazing action (great cinematography) and story telling. The real interviews with the soldiers in the beginning of the episodes gives insight and realism to the show. Because of the large cast, it is hard to build strong connections to individual soldiers, and sometimes you do not even remember their name. However, you still care for them as you build a strong relationship with the group as a whole. Overall an excellent show. Warning it can get very gory in some scenes. I remember when this show was first announced, I used to tape the episodes on VHS each week and watch them religiously. For me, without question, this is THE best TV show ever made. Excellent acting, casting, cinematography, action and emotion. I now watch it at least once a year from start to finish and it's the ONLY thing on IMDB which I have rated 10 for every episode. The fact that it's all true and you actually see and hear the real characters slams it home for me. In a world where people are losing their minds over a flu outbreak, spend some time with Easy Company and see how bad they had it. If you haven't seen this before, what has taken you so long?! I was looking for new series at  ranking, so I found "Band of Brothers". I decided to watch, and it was one of the best decisions I've ever made. This series is fantastic, with nice actors, beautiful stories and places. All episodes are heartbreaking, but Episode 9 is my favourite of them. I dont know why people only talk about GOT,Breaking Bad they are not even real.
Band Of brothers is the type of tv series that I will even show it to my kids .
I think there are few things that you need to see before you die it is sure one of them. For those thinking 'oh it's like 20 years old now, probably some better ones to watch' you are definitely mistaken. This is hands down the best war story. The acting was brilliant, the scenes were amazing, the filming was done to perfection, I don't really have anything to fault in it.
I would highly recommend this to anyone, even you may not enjoy war films, as this doesn't only show the battles of WW2 but instead it gives us some insight into what those soldiers had to live through, and how they were affected by it. The best stand alone TV series of all time with Production values on par with the very best hollywood movies. Astounding. Damien Lewis owns the screen as Dick Winters. 10/10 Very, very good picture of WWII. Very well-done in every way. As said in the sentence, 'carrying a gun together', this kind of brotherhood that was born to the death and handed over to comrades-in-arms, may be the most anticipated emotion of this 'modern world' The episode does not overly describe the cruelty of the war, but only shows the growth and change of the E company soldiers in the war. Such bonds are really subtle. This may be the rare warmth in a brutal war. In this way, in the hearts of every soldier, this experience and friendship will never change no matter where they go. To the heroes, as General Eisenhower said: Veterans are not dead, but they are withered, heros never die! This series made me so emotional and humble. Watching this, I feel gratitude, but also sadness. Thank you soldiers, nurses, each and every person who fought for freedom, thank you each and every man and woman, WW2 veterans. It's hard to believe it all really happened. The story of how one unit of paratroopers were in just about every major engagement in the European theater of WWII. Much better than "Saving Private Ryan." So many iconic moments! Not just "better" than any movie ever made about this tragic part of history, this incredible production is miles better in every department. The compelling journey the Band of Brothers takes you on is without equal. BoB is 8, movie length, block buster scale, brilliantly played docudramas that's terrifying, thrilling, compelling, triadic, enlightening and so much more... Despite its 10 hour runtime Band of Brothers is a testament to the amazing feats of heroism people in WWII had to go through. Yes, even taking Saving Private Ryan into consideration. The interviews at the beginning of each episode with the actual soldiers who were there adds an even more personal touch. Definitely a must-watch. The action packed story of easy company is thrilling and gut wrenching. This very historical accurate ww2 story gives you a look into the battles that easy company took part in. The acting is fantastic as well as the cinematography. The realistic set designs and fantastic effects really immerse you into the show. I cant comprehend how good this series is!. Ive watched many tv series and none of them are as good as this!. The entire production, color palette, sound production is just perfect!. I wish I could write a review that would justify how well this was done. I was hooked . Personally, I grew up ( lived side by side ) in a nursing home for WW2 vets. The physical and emotional injuries alone, the depictions of what this one regiment went through was powerful and enlightening. I am not a war movie buff nor am I a man but I found this accessible and appropriately painful as well as inspirational. And I was impressed by how well the actors ,who were chosen to portray these real life hero's, performed. At the time of writing there are 36 reviews of 6 or under,
eg jmlawton has only written negative reviews so a one star from him is meaningless. To say the battle scenes are unrealistic is plain stupid, just a feeble attempt to down grade the overall percentage, waste of time with so many 7 and above reviews, 513 out of 711 can't be wrong can they!
To complain about the color is also absurd, rich color be De-lux? come on it wasn't a De-lux or Technicolor world in battle what a stupid complaint to make t_higgins.<br/><br/>I could go on picking holes in the daft negative reviews, by now everyone who has seen it knows how well made, directed, acted, written, filmed the whole series was. I never wanted it to end.<br/><br/>The real vets of Easy Company endorsed it as being close to the truth so anyone who says different is just is just attempting to downgrade it, neve going to happen, currently 9.5 stars and will only improve. Some state it fails to show American's did war crimes and rate it low.... truth be told yes they did war crimes..... but then why include this in this series... seems to me these critics do not understand the many many layers in this story (just think about the shooting of all surendering soldiers in the series). .simply where the answer is = the victor write the history... and the Germans did ...as see in the episode "why we fight" even worse war crimes (it is all relative right). Why they actually got away with all the war crimes... well judge after watching..<br/><br/>Regards to the series it is overall an epic history of brave men, and how they behaved and acted under extreme circumstance and built the world we have today. It is a must see.. and I recommend seeing it several times to understand how well it actually is..... there are more layers to this series than initially meets the eye. This is the best mini-series ever made, in my opinion. Not that it doesn't have a couple of factual errors here and there, but they're all minor. And what it gets right, it gets perfect. It is both entertaining and historical, having taken the care to gather the remaining survivors of Easy company and interviewed them to book end each of the ten chapters along with a few paragraphs of historical context or an appropriate quote.<br/><br/>I watch the entire series start to finish every year, usually around memorial day. What makes the series so incredible isn't just the world-defining events these soldiers lived through or the remarkable experiences of their service, but the intensely human touch it puts on the stories. Very few movies or shows manage to capture the humanity, good and bad, of the real people whose lives they depict.<br/><br/>Even when people set out to, it's extraordinarily difficult to find a narrative structure that encapsulates everything without succumbing to the temptation to rearrange, combine, or eliminate events to better suite the flow of the story. Not that the series is a blow by blow of every moment, but the portions it focuses on are told with honesty and paint a coherent picture of their time. It's a testament to the care that went into creating the series that the producers found a way to tell these stories without extensively editing them.<br/><br/>They also found one of the most amazing casts I've ever seen. When you scroll down the imdb page for the show, it's easy to forget how many of these actors were relatively unknown when the show was made; whoever was in charge of casting had a truly gifted eye for talent. Most of the actors even managed to affect a strong physical resemblance to the people they were portraying, something you discover as the last episode comes to a close.<br/><br/>As far as I'm concerned, each of the episodes could stand on its own as an entertaining mini movie, but seeing them together really brings into focus the sacrifices, triumphs, and struggles of some of those who saved the world from fascism. That said, I do have some favorites. 'Bastogne', in particular, is so visceral and intense that I think of it every time I'm sitting in front of the fire on a particularly cold night.<br/><br/>Stories of soldiers sacrificing for their nation isn't, of course, exactly a hard theme to find in entertainment. Even just WWII by itself probably has enough material made about it that you could spend a year doing nothing but watching films. But I think the series stands out by its dedication to honesty of narrative and finding a group of soldiers who participated in so many major events in the war. The world is losing the last surviving witnesses to the events that would shape the world for a century or more; how lucky we are to have this to remind us of where we came from.<br/><br/>So long and godspeed, Toccoa men. Thank you for your service, and to those men and women that followed you. Lux tua nos ducat.<br/><br/>Currahee! Gripping, humbling, inspiring. we owe these men so much; they are indeed the greatest generation of all. may they all rest in peace. Awesome war series! It really hits home to the truth as to what happened over in Normandy during WWII. The only TV series I have watched worthy of an overall 10/10 in my opinion.<br/><br/>Without a doubt the finest war-time drama that's made it to TV/Film.<br/><br/>Stunning. There is no detail or scene that would ever need to be edited or changed in this masterpiece. They were the greatest generation, the realism, the intensity, the humanity makes this miniseries a work of art, along with the commentary from the BOB unit members , which only adds to the realism.
Brilliant acting and directing.
A perfect tribute to those men. I wasn't a paratrooper in WW2. Heck, I wasn't even born during or before WW2. And yet this mini-series has made me feel like I was part of Easy Company. I was with them, behind the lines in Normandie, almost freezing to death in Bastogne, and rejoicing when they found out that the war had ended. I developed such a devastating emotional attachment to all of the soldiers, and the events they went through made me wonder how in the heck they managed to come out of the war, recover and come back into society as whole, (pretty much) sane people. When I was finished with the series it had created a void in me, that I knew I'll only be able to fill when I'm rewatching it. I think it will still always be there. I will carry these stories and men with me.
Band of Brothers is authentic, raw, and emotional. It makes you ask yourself some complicated questions. It's also beautifully shot and directed.
All around, it's a must-watch if you are even a teeny tiny bit of a WW2 enthusiast. It deserve to be within top 5 series of all time..<br/><br/>when I watch a tv or a movie works I actually analyze it..and all what I can say about this show is perfect from all rounds ..<br/><br/>well written and directed,best acting, very good effects and cinematography, nice music.. simply there is no flaws and u will never get upset.<br/><br/>u will get different types of emotions and expressions and you will engage with the characters and events..<br/><br/>you will definitely enjoy and love it ! Easily the best thing I've ever watched on TV or film. The acting is superb, the direction is outstanding, the sets, special effects and makeup are incredible. And of course the storyline is what grabs you - to think it all actually happened makes it all the more incredible. This series will remain with me forever and has been my top choice of anything to view. I doubt it'll ever be bettered. Outstanding. The filming prove that real life can be traduced into an entertaining- addictive story. Action: 10. Adventure: 10. Drama: Difficulties all the time, but very well raffled. Humor: Fantastic brush strokes. Romance: Not an issue here, of course, but slightly included when story needed it. The evolution of characters is very well carried by the story-line. 10 episodes you will watch one after the other. I can assure you will investigate for the real story of that group and the real story of the other groups after the D day. After this, you will never see something this entertaining ever. Except, maybe, for the HBO series The Wire. Do not even think you would find this quality of series in The Pacific: quite well, but not this much. I caught this when the first time around on HBO. I missed the last few and caught them this time around. I'm glad I did. This series should be must see for high school kids so they can go home and thank there grand fathers or in my case father. War sucks and this does show does anything but glamorize it. It shows what real heroes are and how these guys that died gave you the life you lead now. The acting is way above par for a TV show. They really pulled no punches. The d-day scene were they drop into France was as compelling as the opening of Private Ryan. It is rare that a TV show has me glued to my seat each week. The added touch of interviewing the actual men that served really hit home. I sorry my dad who passed away Labor day of 2001 was not able to watch this. He served in the Pacific during WWII and Korea and did not like to talk about it much. I see why. 10/10 You can't make better TV. Band of Brothers is the greatest mini-series ever made. In fact, it outdoes every movie ever made about World War II. Based on Stephen Ambrose's book of the same name, B.O.B. follows the men of Company E (Easy), 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment from their training in Georgia to Hitler's Eagle's Nest. The actors are all believable playing these real-life heroes. Damien Lewis gives an exceptional performance as Major Richard Winters the one-time Commander of Easy Company as does Donny Wahlberg as Carwood Lipton, their First Sergeant. Powerful, brutal, funny, poignant, and gut-wrenching, B.O.B. shows combat up-close and in your face and so accurate you'd think you were there.<br/><br/>Each episode contains bits of interviews with the actual members of Easy Company to give you perspective on the episode and what was going through the paratroopers' minds and different points of the war. The best of these clips was of Major Winters telling of a day when his grandson asked: "Grandpa, were you a hero in the war?" Maj. Winters replied to him saying, "No, but I served in a company of heroes." I highly recommend this mini-series to anyone who wants to know more about the war in Europe. I also suggest you read the original book, as well as Easy Company veteran David Kenyon Webster's memoire "Parachute Infantry". 10 out of 10 stars Band of Brothers(T.V)(2001)*****Starring:Damian Lewis,Donnie Wahlberg, Ron Livingston, Matthew Settle, Rick Warden.<br/><br/>The story of easy company's struggle to survive the war.<br/><br/>This is a very good miniseries it is long but very well worth your time. The battle scenes are very graphic and well done and also very entertaining and edgy. The acting is also very good. I think this one will really start up Damian Lewis's career he was superb in this miniseries.<br/><br/>
Not Rated but contains Strong Graphic War Violence and Language in all the episodes. Part Nine Contains a Sex scene with Brief Nudity. My favourite tv show ever. i watch it all the time, havent been able to find any show better. the fact that the show was made so it was believable make it very tense n heartwarming The title above says it all, but this also series is launched by one of the most beautiful pieces of music ever written by anyone, anytime. Michal Kamen wrote a masterpiece that totally and absolutely evokes the tragic sacrifice of so many in the name of freedom. A little too draggy in the middle but still the best. May war never exist. I first watched this series way back when it came out on DVD in 2003 when my unit was activated following 9/11. We watched it several times during deployments when we were lucky enough to have a day off.
I still get pulled into this serious even though I know what is going to happen. The authenticity of the uniforms, equipment, and just all around feel of the series is superb in my opinion.<br/><br/>The generation depicted in this series have all since passed away, but that doesn't change the impact they have had on me and many others from that generation. A series such as this are few and far between. I have watched the Pacific as well and I still believe that Band of Brothers is a better assembled television series.<br/><br/>I have seen so many documentaries on the Civil War, WWI, & WWII as well as movies portrayed during that time period. This is one of the Top 10 in my opinion and is a must see, even now, if you have NOT seen it. This realistic masterpiece takes you on an epic journey in the second world war during the invasion of Normandy. The cast, scenes, locations, edit and music are really well selected what makes this series one of the best I've ever seen. The feeling being at war, the high risk of loosing lives and fight for a higher pourpose. All these things makes watching Band of Brothers, very moving and beautiful. My deepest respect for all soldiers who gave their lives for our freedom. I rated this one with a 10 star review. It has been some time since I watched this show on first broadcast – long before streaming and on demand, I remember it was appointment television for me to be sure to be back in time to watch it (I also did not own a VCR back then I think). Coming from the pedigree of HBO, BBC, and Spielberg, the series was a really banner affair, and it did not disappoint. Watching it again 15 years later, this is still the case. The production values are incredibly high, and the recreation of the conditions, spirit, and specific actions of Easy Company is compelling television. It is not constant action, and it is not always violent, however it keeps the war constantly in the air, and it is quite oppressive viewing at times in the way it does this while throwing in moments of sudden pointless violence.<br/><br/>At times it does get a bit too sentimental, but the sense of realism balances this out I thought, and the scale of loss and death makes it easy to justify why the series did this. The main characters are well portrayed, and the supporting characters had sufficient material to make us buy into the squad – not just a few main characters. Ironically this is something that has altered with time. Watching it now I was surprised by just how many famous faces there were in the show. Of course the main cast has turns from Lewis, Livingston, McDonough, Fletcher, Wahlberg, and many others you will know – as well as one or two big names in small roles (most notably Schwimmer). However in roles so small they barely have a line, you also have people like Simon Pegg, Jimmy Fallon, Andrew Scott, James McAvoy, Fassbender, Colin Hanks, and many others. Perhaps I did not know them at the time and they were already famous, but it does feel now that they had a real bed of talent just starting to emerge. Of course the downside of this is that it is a bit distracting now, and many episodes has several moments where you spot people like this in smaller roles. <br/><br/>The series is strong though, with great drama and production values throughout. The deep cast help, but it is the writing and intense battle sequences that really draw you in. The focus on an American squad does feel a little like it plays into the usual 'the Americans won the war" thing, but I didn't mind this – aside from the few British characters who do appear, who unfortunately are played a little as stereotype and not so heroic in their efforts. Despite this though, a great series that has stood up really well over time. Once in awhile, a series, movie, or song comes along and when you witness it, you are happy that you did. BAND OF BROTHERS is one of those series. It's the production of HBO, Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks (executive producers) and it tells the story of Easy Company of the 101st airborne during World War II. Every single thing you see is based on facts and I think that is what makes the story so compelling. The series is composed of 10 episodes, each and hour long and like I said it charts the progress of Easy Company as told by the men who served with the company. The acting in this series is not only first class, but world class as well. None of the actors are well known at all (except David Schwimmer) and I think by using unknowns you don't have a lot of over acting. I hope that the actors that portrayed the real life characters get picked up for other things. Anyway, the DVD comes in a 6 disc set with 2 shows on each disc and the 6th disc full of bonus features. At the time of this review, it has been awhile since I have seen this series (I own it), but it stays with me to this very day. It truly shows you the sacrifices and absolutely heroic deeds that ordinary people do in extraordinary times. After serving, myself for 20 years, I know that the best friends in the world that I made were in the service and this accurately portrays how your friends have your back. This series doesn't just tell you the story but you are taken along and you feel as if you are there, in the trenches with Easy Company. This is only second to Roots. My husband and I had watched all the episodes of The Band of Brothers on HBO...we watched again when the series was repeated.  Every time we view it, we'd see something different we didn't catch before.  My husband actually had tears in his eyes when listening to the soldiers that were being interviewed before each episode!  Insurmountable genius to use that format.<br/><br/>I purchased it for my husband for Christmas because he told me, "that film is the best movie I have ever seen and it moved me more than I can tell you"<br/><br/>As a woman, most of my friends think I am "different" for liking war movies, but I was literally mesmerized by the special effects and was glued to the edge of my seat listening to each man's accounts and memories (and I had the tissue box handy for my husband!) Having grown up in a family where my father was greatly interested in history, and made sure that I was educated in knowledge of war and war films, I thought this series would be another to add to the list of dull and repetitive tried example of being a hero.<br/><br/>Oh, how wrong my opinion was. What this series truly is is a personal story throughout, a solider trying to lead his men to the right course against so many obstacles, with numerous moments of poignancy and heart rendering sadness. You feel emotionally attached to every character, whether vital to the plot or not, as they head off into battle. You sit on the edge of your seat wondering how Easy Company can all manage to survive their designated mission, and every time the battle is of epic proportions and gripping to the end.<br/><br/>It seems as though this could be the perfect drama: with music apt to every second, and acting so flawless, it really seems as though Damien Lewis, who is simply superb as the chief character Richard D. Winters, is actually American when you know he is not. <br/><br/>I would recommend this to anyone, regardless of whether you enjoy this type of programme. It will make you cry, and rightly so, for this is a powerful, outstanding and beyond remarkable piece of film of sheer brilliance.<br/><br/>Definitely worth watching. I had heard a lot about Band of Brothers (BoB) before actually seeing a single episode. I had heard the typical DVD buffs proclaiming it as great, I'd seen the IMDB rating, which still hangs in at 9.5 as it did back then (is that the highest rating anything has in here, by the way?)<br/><br/>I missed the showing of the series the first time it appeared on television here, but it's been on several channels since, and one night I happened to channel hop right onto an episode of it, immediately understanding that the desaturated unsentimental images of actual war I saw had to be Band of Brothers.<br/><br/>I noticed in some comment here that it would be unfair to compare it to Saving Private Ryan, and that's true. Saving Private Ryan would come off really bad if we did. Band of Brothers is a superior narrative of wartime events by far.<br/><br/>Interestingly, showing events as they happened, words actually said, situations endured, but without glamour, sentiment, glorification and the annoying waving of American flags and inspired speeches that seem to be too numerous in war films, the emotional impact of BoB is a lot stronger than anything I've seen before.<br/><br/>Watching this, the viewer becomes part of Easy Company, as the characters grow on you, and the experience is the next best thing to actually having been there, to share in that brotherhood, the bond, and the overlaid meaninglessness that there is in war.<br/><br/>And it has those key moments when the sum of impressions just fill you up and comes rushing at you with goosebumps and even the most cynical viewer getting a tear in the corner of their eye.<br/><br/>For me, as it was the first episode I partly saw, the first such key moment was at the end of it back in England after the D-Day push when someone goes to pick up their laundry, and the laundry lady asking if a certain Lieutenant is going to pick up his, being with the same company, after all, and goes on to list several others whose laundry hasn't been picked up. Seeing it for the first time, and only part of the episode, the names didn't mean anything to me, but the significance of the situation makes for a very powerful image that touched me greatly, and it was then I knew I had to get BoB on DVD.<br/><br/>Visual effects are wonderfully made. At no point in the series do you think of them as visual effects, CGI or otherwise. It looks real, it feels real, as if someone was running around with a camera back then and the footage just showed up in impeccable condition a few years ago for the producers to put together into the series. <br/><br/>Also I particularly noted how the bullet sounds were more real than I've noticed in any movie before. Most production teams concentrate on the sound of gunfire, for some reason, but the sound of a bullet is something very special, and, which I'm sure few really think about, you hear it long before the sound of the corresponding gunfire as it travels at several times the speed of sound (that's why guns sound so loud, the bang coming as the bullet breaks the sound barrier a few times over), and in BoB it sounded like they had recorded the sound from bullets actually fired rather than making the run-of-the-mill whistling sound of a budget sound effects team.<br/><br/>With that attention to detail put into the entire production, this is one to see over and over and over again. In war, there might be no equal to the efforts and achievements of Easy Company, and now Tom, Steven and their band of filmmaking brothers might have made the cinematic equivalent of those efforts, truly honouring the memory of the people, spirit and events that marked the beginning of the end of the war. Currahee! This series was just amazing. It was great on any perspective like acting, shooting, directing, etc. It also pictured pretty well the 101st airborne units time at the war. I also liked the short part on the beginning of every episode, where the original veterans told their experiences and their feelings about the war. This is the way that a war movie/series should look like.<br/><br/>Make more of this kind movies and series... I now own the brilliant DVD collection set of what has to be the finest war epic i have ever seen in my life.  It's touching enough to hear about the war through tough personal stories spoken by those family relations. <br/><br/>
Now we have the stories told in a way that i can describe only as 'mesmerising and deeply moving'.  Warner Brothers presents 'Band of Brothers', the 10 part mini series that covers the horror and the bonding of war from the training camp through to D-Day and continuing on to the surrender of the German Army.<br/><br/>The casting for the series is spot on, with outstanding performances coming from Damien Lewis, Ron Livingston and Donnie Wahlberg to name a few.  All the characters are based on the real people....as are the the events that are covered over a mighty 10 hours!!!<br/><br/>The series is recognised as the most expensive project that has ever been created.  In my view i dont think they waisted a single penny of it...the visuals are stunning, the scripting is fantastic, the music score is exceptional and moving and the landscapes is just how i would imagine it!<br/><br/>Tom Hanks and Steve Spielbergs seem to have the midas touch with anything they have an association with!<br/><br/>Hats off lads<br/><br/>10/10! I watched this on DVD over the last week or so and eagerly awaited the postman daily for the next disc to turn up from my DVD club.<br/><br/>Right from the first episode during training, the characters are all engaging, believable and interesting. So many familiar faces amongst the cast all of whom pulled off this, based on fact tale.<br/><br/>At the beginning of each episode there are interviews with real surviving veterans, describing events as they remember them from each location. It is not until the end of the last episode that their names are revealed as the actual characters you have been watching.<br/><br/>It currently has a rating of 9.5 on here at the time of writing - the highest I have seen for anything - totally deserved. Band of Brothers came close to a 9 for me, however, the show has issues that cannot be overlooked.<br/><br/>First let me say that I FERVENTLY enjoyed this. Lots of action, good acting and beautiful set pieces. This miniseries has few flaws but lacking flaws doesn't make it a 10/10. Let me explain.<br/><br/>Game of Thrones got one thing right and that is in how it handles so many characters. The biggest problem with BoB is simply character introduction; too many times in the first half of the series I could not place names on familiar faces and that heavily impacted my ability to enjoy this show. Winters, Nixon, Harry, Buck, Bull, Malarky. I got them. The rest I desperately tried to follow but often got them confused with one another and their names mixed up. Later on in the series I got the names sorted out and I often found myself thinking things like, "So they were making jokes about 'him' earlier. Man, if I'd known that at the time I would have laughed," but no. I am without a doubt that this show is better on a second viewing but first impressions matter. I tried watching this show with 4 different people (1 a seasoned war veteran) and none of them made it through the whole thing because they could not keep track of who was who-they lost interest. These 4 people completely vary in attention span, age and interests and if none of them became seriously invested (and they all have varying degrees of like for military based media) then something is wrong. I myself wasn't invested until episode 7, after that I was on board and finally felt like I was appreciating the show the way the creators intended me to.<br/><br/>Bottom line, great tv. Other issues that I have are more based off of personal preference. However, I am adamant that this show mostly fails to properly introduce characters and, in my opinion, reduces it's otherwise good qualities to a score of 8/10.<br/><br/>To be clear, 8/10 is a positive score to those who are undoubtably hovering their finger/mouse above the unhelpful bottom, because they blindly love BoB so much. Lmao, go ahead and click it. Just try to let people have different opinions in the future, please. One of the best TV shows ever made. Seen it when it aired originally on BBC and it still blows me away to this day. So raw and real and funny at times, you'll feel every emotion you've got in every single episode. Series with only one series but had everything you can expect from a war theme series. Does justice to the IMDb rating. Winters wins your heart. Amazing cast, acting, historical accuracy, effects, character development. For war movie buffs it didn't get any better than this movie. Pure class from start to finish you won't want to turn your head away from the screen because you won't want to miss a second...... Brilliant, bleak and incredibly difficult to watch at times due to the rawness of the story. The cinematography is stunning as is the acting and script. Incredible, must see TV. We viewed, we happily viewed, this "Band of Brothers". I have only just discovered this series (having received the box set for Christmas) and I have to say it is absolutely outstanding. The acting is superb from a mixture of British actors and (to me) unknown Americans (apart from Donnie Wahlberg). I understand this was the most expensive mini series ever made and it looks like every penny was well spent as it looks fantastic. To be able to round out such large ensemble cast in 10 one-hour episodes is a superb feat - to the point that by the end I was genuinely moved when it cut to the veterans who had been interviewed, and revealed who they were. On top of this is the fact that the majority of survivors have since died, so it feels that maybe something that feels as historically genuine as this could never be made again. I may be a 16 year old girl, but this series effected me so much! i'm from Israel and all we learn at school about WWII is what happened to the Jews in the holocaust. after seeing this series i learned so much! It is so important that people will know what really happened in the war. and to the 101st Airborne and it's people that sacrificed themselves in order to bring peace to the world I think that the entire cast was brilliant and the series itself is the best series ever! and i mean it! i got the DVD and i can't stop watching it! i'm also reading the book! I've learn so much from this series and I hope other people will too. As an x serviceman in the New Zealand Army,I found this series of great interest personally. I felt that the contact scenes (fire fights) were exceptionally realistic. Lt Winters presented himself in the documentary as a very compassionate and intelligent human being. I have had the privilege of serving under the command of a fine soldier with very similar traits, and as a result, I have developed into a better person myself. Although this series is primly about American soldiers, the friendships that were portrayed are universal when people are thrust into situations of battle. I intend to show the excellent doc that comes with the DVD set, and facilitate a lesson to the Young Offenders that I work with. I'am currently employed as a Youth Worker in South Australia and the series presents many moral reasoning issues that can be problem solved in a work group. Through History we can educate ourselves for the future!! My father served in WWII.  One of my uncles never came back from WWII, being kiiled at Metz in 1944.  Not surprisingly, my father only talked about the "good times" of the war, never the bad times.<br/><br/>I think that for myself, as well as all the other relatives and survivors of WWII veterans, this movie, along with Saving Private Ryan bring home the harsh reality of war to those of us who do not know it.<br/><br/>For that reason alone, if no other, I believe this to be one of the best movies ever be seen.  If you haven't seen it, I recommend it highly. Excellent telling of WWII events from the survivors stories,a stellar cast and a dedicated wardrobe bring these events to the screen in a satisfactory way,at the end of each episode you will want to binge on this some more and several reenactments are quite engaging and realistic,this is a must see for any WWII enthusiasts and is on a similar par to SAVING PRIVATE RYAN....enjoy It's really an excellent peace of direction,acting,story line and all.Its a must watch. It will make you feel all the emotions characters going through. the pain of war,horror, sacrifice, and above all the bond between brothers of the land. I had to go and make an IMDb account just to rate this mini series 10/10.Its stunning how good it is and i would strongly recommend it to anyone. I have seen many TV series so far and I must say this is probably the best one I've ever seen. BoB coudn't be more realistic and perfect. This men's heroic sacrifice was perfectly portrayed in this unique Tv show. 10/10 We all saw avengers but how many of us saw this masterpiece? This is called the actual war, and how it was fought. It was like reliving the past, a walk through of the history. Thanks a lot to the team who did research and made this miniseries happen. Each and every detail was too perfect. Timeless, essential, a masterpiece. Perfect in just about every way, the special effects were literally groundbreaking. New technology developed for production is still the cutting edge available.<br/><br/>Every actor was cast perfectly, and even those that have gone to have mediocre career performances since, seem to have given their greatest performance here.<br/><br/>It's impressive that in such a short series, 10 episodes, that so much can be achieved. The series takes place over several years and still manages to make the viewer feel they have witnessed the entire journey. B.O.B manages to capture a wide view of the war, despite following (mostly) one group of the US 101st Airborne.<br/><br/>Nothing is sugar coated and they're not always the good guys. It's a well balanced and incredibly personal journey. You will cry, you will feel sorry for both sides, you will care about the characters.<br/><br/>There has never been a more essential war story. I have re-watched Band of Brothers every year since it came out on D-Day. Pure class I have been watching this for over thousands time. this is a really good series that how people can really understand about the ww2 history A really good portrait of what went on in the war, very realistic and superbly acted. Can't find any words to describe it. Beautiful. You need to watch it, at least once. As the title suggests this is my absolute favourite TV series. I can always keep going back to it and watch it over and over again. Very compelling story told in the best way possible. I think this is pretty much the ultimate WWII movie and nothing will ever come close to it.<br/><br/>You get to see the war through the perspective of Easy Company from the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne, from the moment they begin training in boot camp all the way to the end of the war. The first episode is a slow build as you're barely getting to know these characters and the obstacles that lie ahead of them, but as soon as they jump out of that plane, it's a non stop thrill ride.<br/><br/>The miniseries is packed to the brim with extremely well done battle sequences that rival anything that's ever been shot, including Spielberg's own Private Ryan. Sure, you don't get another scene of storming the beaches of Normandy, but you do get an exhilarating sequence of them trying to get in by air.<br/><br/>The firefights are all really well staged and you feel like you're right there with them. I couldn't get over how authentic and real everything looked. Each battle sequence is extremely memorable and they all have twists and turns you never see coming. The performance from the lead Damien Lewis is outstanding as well.<br/><br/>I can't count the amount of times that I was at the edge of my seat or was literally gasping in shock and awe. But all of that is balanced with quiet and authentic character moments that really stay with you. There's even a romance subplot in one of the episodes, and let me tell you, you won't forget it either.<br/><br/>You simply need to watch this miniseries. It's one of the best miniseries ever created and I'll probably watch it all again in the future. It's that good. The hard work that went into this production is astounding. I truly respect and am grateful for each man and woman who worked on this set to produce such a beautiful and epic series. I believe everyone should see this, because it's just about as real as it can get. I hold this so close to my heart.
Hang tough. If you want an almost 100% accurate depiction of the European theatre during WW2 this is the ticket! Band of Brothers gives you a astonishing view into the missions of Easy Company.
I really appreciate how much work and detail was put into this miniseries from the cast to the script and music. It is near perfection for me!
It is astounding what these men went through to keep us free. I come away feeling that I have a greater understanding and appreciation for my freedom which was not earned at an easy price! CONCLUSION: GO WATCH IT! YOU WILL BE AWE INSPIRED! When this came out I waited in anticipation weekly for the next episode. I loved it so much I bought the DVD's. This is IMO the best war film ever made. The character development is so good that you really feel like you know each of them. The realism and details are done to perfection. There's parts of this series that will have you on edge and in tears. The thought that the men they represent lived this is just mind blowing. If there is a time capsul somewhere this series should be included.. yes, it's that brilliant! Rest In Peace soldiers This is one of the only WWII shows/films that delivers an entertaining series while staying historically accurate This series should go down as the best depiction of what was sacrificed for freedom. It is a raw reminder of what war is and the costs of war. This is a series I re-watch each year on Remembrance/Veterans day asa reminder of how lucky each of is for living free. In my humble opinion this series should be watched by students when they come of age to understand the impact of war. You know when names like Hanks and Spielberg are attached there will be no compromise on the quality and realism. They don't make mini-series like this anymore but they need to. I have watched this series multiple times I can't get enough of it, I have read so many reviews and they all for this.... they really hit the perfect mix of film/documentary... I had so many mixed emotions through out it all so I would 10/10 recommend everyone to watch it 😍 Cast so widely, this series is the Top example for true Mastery of the Arts of Film & Dramatic Historical Recreation and is a portrayal of one of the many reasons we called them, "The Greatest Generation". I'm out of words really. what could I say actually? It is the greatest cinematic war work I have ever seen til now and definitely one of the best WWII embodiment. I can't describe how much it was realistic. I was fascinated by the characters' variety. I was also amazed when I glanced Tom Hanks is one of the directors and one of the producers with Steven Spielberg. Moreover, I really liked the structure of each episode, How it did starts with that chilling intro, then the real heroes giving a preface and finally the side facts of each story at the end. I loved how each episode somehow focused on one of the characters view and story. The cast was amazing. The cinematography absolutely deserves a huge credit for those incredible shots and excitement. I haven't caught any flaw in any episode. I really enjoyed every minute of this series. I felt I was with them in so many moments. I won't forget this. I am certainly will watch this again one day. Thanks for every single person who took apart in to create this masterpiece. My dad insisted I watch this show when I was 12 and while I went into watching it reluctantly, I absolutely loved it! The show is very gory and shows the brutality of war exactly like Saving Private Ryan does. The drama is amazing and the show can be very very sad, but also extremely lighthearted at times.<br/><br/>The show follows many members of the 101st Airborne and by the end you feel like they are your family. You see how each cope with the effects of war like killing an unarmed Nazi soldier, isolation from family, and the loss of limbs or friends. The amazing actors are all to thank for these gamut of emotions displayed on the screen. Most of them all went on to have amazing careers or star in tv shows of their own.<br/><br/>The show was very educational for me as well because up until that point I had no idea what the Holocaust was or what a Nazi concentration camp looked like. The show is able to demonstrate many things that most American citizens have no idea went on during the war in European countries. Most of the things that are shown were absolutely eye opening for me.<br/><br/>I highly, highly recommend this show! I am not a fan of gory or war TV, but there is a lot of drama and history behind it that I respected. This show is in my Top 5 for favorite shows of all time! Please watch it!!! Not only is the best tv series of all time , it alsco can compete with war films such as saving private ryan, platoon or Navarone Canions. Complete masterpiece from spielberg Great acting and great story. Don't miss this amazing series. Some call it a miniseries, but it's really the greatest American war film ever made. Far superior to the overrated The Pacific, this pulls no punches, and comes even closer than Saving Private Ryan in making someone feel like they are there. The big difference is everything that happens on film, actually happened. From the training days to the end of the war, this is the story of the 101st Airborne division. The cast is superb, the memories of the veterans are amazing. I've watched this time and again, and will watch it again. It's simply that good. All political bull aside, this one is a REAL gem. I've seen many similar shows/movies, but nothing ever topped Band of Brothers. Even 2018 movies, with well developed special effects and sounds - BoB tops everything for me.<br/><br/>Oh, how much I love the fact that this one is based on a true story. I love that BoB has implemented segments of the TRUE heroes talking. I found many similarities between the real heroes and the actors (such as speech similarities, roles are obviously very similar in character). <br/><br/>I've felt many many intense emotions during those loud but sad scenes. The perfect combination of sound, emotion, attributes and an overwhelming storyline.<br/><br/>What another pleasant surprise was that I saw my favorite actor - Tom Hardy - suddenly appearing in one of the episodes! Among the best the war stories of all time, and probably the best TV series of all time, Band of Brothers displays with sincere accuracy the tribulations of the men in the 101st Airborne during World War 2. The show reminds us that the men at war are people, they are individuals, they are human and they matter. Among the best scenes of the show for me is the speech the German General gave to his men when the Nazi's lost the war; because we sometimes forget that our enemies are people too.<br/><br/>And people are just people; not good, not bad, just people. This has to be the best "Docudrama" of all time. Despite the fact that war often brings out the worst in people, this show proves that it can also bring out the best. Where this fiction, no one would believe it, but the quiet heroism and determination of the men of Easy Company are a worthy tribute to the fighting men of World War II. <br/><br/>This series has me in tears every time I watch it. Most poignant are the first hand accounts of the participants that open every episode. there is no false bravado nor mock heroics, simply the determination and courage of men who refuse to let their comrades down, and who are willing to risk everything in order to get the job done and uphold the honour of the unit. <br/><br/>The quality of this show is beyond compare, and I recommend it whole heartedly to anyone who wants to see what people can do when they are put to the test.<br/><br/>Every episode has a level of reality and authenticity that really stands out. The viewer sees the horror of war and the brutality of battle at first hand, but the show doesn't dwell on the gore and suffering for their own sake. There is no glorification of killing, and the psychological effects of continuous combat are made clear in the most sensitive manner possible. <br/><br/>This show is essential viewing for anyone who wants to learn about World War II. I cannot recommend it too highly Navy and Marines run deep in my family. From W.W.2 to Desert Storm, I've had relatives, friends, and classmates who served proudly, and growing up in San Diego, I've learned to say Anchors Aweigh, and OohRah in the same breath. When this series first came out, I was instantly intrigued. I watched, and was captivated by the entire thing. I've had relatives and friends say the realism was so great, they had a tough time watching some of it. I now own the Blu ray of this series, and still watch it from time to time. It is an excellent series, and very authentic. I only wish my grandpa was still alive so he could give me his thoughts on it. I highly recommend this series, and I recommend buying it too. Possibly the single best World War 2 film/TV show of all time. Makes "Saving Private Ryan" seem like the tamest Pixar kids movie. An absolute must-watch for anyone with even the slightest interest in the Second World War, and even incredibly enjoyable if you typically aren't into WW2 stuff.<br/><br/>Stories of the war presented by actual soldiers of the war, on which the characters are based. The real-life/-real-soldiers aspect of it is handled delicately and respectfully, with a good balance of recognising the heroism and bravery of those who fought in WW2 whilst also making the endless horrors of war abundantly clear. A difficult task to undertake, and one that most War fiction struggle with, but one that is masterfully handled.<br/><br/>Furthermore, I really appreciate the way that Band of Brothers does not simply paint the Allies as the clear-cut "good guys" nor does it show the Axis forces as being "bad" or "evil" in black-and-white terms. It recognises that the soldiers fighting on both sides were not simply good or bad but were people fighting for largely uncertain reasons, and that the experiences of the war were equally as brutal and awful for both sides.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it already you should. It's 10-hours long and every minute feels completely essential. Starts a little slow but once it gets going it is truly amazing. Fantastic stuff. As someone who is not a die-hard fan of war movies/TV series, I have to say that Band of Brothers is absolutely fantastic in every way imaginable. I've re-watched it 3 times already and every time it's as good, if not better, than the last. The cast is amazing, the characters are interesting and the story is really easy to get lost inside. What makes it even better is probably the fact that it's all based on a true story and, even though certain things have most likely been modified/exaggerated, there's a certain appeal to witnessing something that happened not so long ago. Also, every episode includes a couple of minutes of interviews/statements with actual Soldiers that lived to tell the tale of "Band of Brothers", and I think those are really special.<br/><br/>I'll be brief and say it's simply perfect and absolutely worth watching! Easiest (and probably the first) 10/10 score I've given so far. *** This review may contain spoilers *** <br/><br/>Band of Brothers , a real Dramatic WW-II, I've impressed by the great work that was on it, the effect , the acting , the dialogue was So amazing From the First episode to the last episode . That TV show Hit me deeply, They show us how much it is difficult to be in the WW2 those men that sacrificed their lives on the battlefronts and must never be forgotten .. Easy Company Will remain in our hearts .. Easy Company are infinite <3 !! <br/><br/>I gave it a 10/10 and this is not enough !! <br/><br/>This is a great TV Show, i highly recommend it to other ,, it's a Masterpiece <3 Band of brothers is truly a hell of miniseries i can easily say it's one of best mini series I've ever watched. The series presents Easy company side in WW-II and shows closely their journey through the war, i personally think the perfection of the show comes from showing all sides of life as we know it in the show i mean. fear,laugh,hatred,hope and love. The casting is amazing ,the acting was great. If you have the chance to see this masterpiece, do so. It is long but you can spread the episodes over some days. But if you start watching it is very hard to stop. Definitely one of the best WW-II movies or series out there. i gave 10 out of 10 and it deserves every star of them. First, let me get the spoiler out of the way: We win!<br/><br/>This show/movie/series is like a potato chip; you can't watch just one.<br/><br/>So you know where I'm coming from, let me tell you about my typical movie list:<br/><br/>I'm a peace-loving sort of guy; a pacifist, a hippie, etc. etc. etc. But... I absolutely love war stories. You will seldom get a better drama unfold before you then you do in a war movie. Add a hefty dose of "real story" to that and you have the makings of, not just a good movie, but a great movie. Band of Brothers is exactly that!<br/><br/>Other movies that have the honors of some of the top places on this list of mine would be Platoon, Saving Private Ryan, Lawrence of Arabia, Bridge Over the River Kwai, and Letters from Iwo Jima. If any of those movies have struck a chord with you in the past, this is one that would definitely be worth your time to watch.<br/><br/>If you watch the first episode, nearly a movie in and of itself, you will be drawn to watching the next 9. It's rather dangerous actually. 11 hours later, you may end up forgetting the little things like eating, drinking and sleeping.<br/><br/>As for the cast:<br/><br/>Many of the actors in it are/were relatively unknown at the time. Damien Lewis, for instance was in very few movies prior to this, but his acting especially is superb! He played such a convincing role as Winters, that even the cast didn't realize he was British until the end of filming. After this, I saw Stephen King's Dreamcatcher (which also features Donnie Wahlberg) and and smiled a bit when I saw him in the lead role.<br/><br/>Scott Grimes (Malarkey) who has done a plethora of TV movies and shows also acts out a great role. The only thing I can honestly say I recall him being in before this was Critters 2, as a teenager. But thanks to our trusty IMDb database, you can see his roles for yourself.<br/><br/>Then there's Mark Wahlberg's brother, Donnie. He plays, perhaps, one of the most charismatic characters in the show and trust me, you will be hard-pressed to not feel something for Lipton throughout the series. You'll forget his New Kinds on the Block phase and totally be absorbed in his role in this show.<br/><br/>Then, if you're like me, you probably never heard of or say Neal Mcdonough prior to this, but you'll soon recognize him in his later roles in movies like The Hitcher, Captain America, Traitor and Walking Tall. <br/><br/>Last, but not least (for this abridged list at least) we have Ron Livingston. Despite being the brunt of a Family Guy joke, I actually did remember him from roles like Swingers and Office Space. I was thrilled to see him in this show and his Role and Nixon (not the President) was definitely one well worth remembering.<br/><br/>The show:<br/><br/>You have about 11 hours of pure bliss with this show as it follows the men from the 101st Airborne, focusing primarily on Easy Company.<br/><br/>At the start of each episode, you have the actual members of Easy being interviewed about the basic subject for that episode, which just adds even more atmosphere to the story. At the end, you get to see their names and make the connection with each of the characters you were following for the past 11 hours.<br/><br/>Speaking of characters... there's a lot! On my 20-sometingith viewing I'm still noticing characters in the earlier episodes that are given more focus in the later ones - "Doc" Roe for instance. You will only benefit from watching this show multiple times, as more of the story comes to light and the characters come alive with each viewing.<br/><br/>You can visually and emotionally watch each of the characters mature form young recruits to war-hardened veterans, and it happens in such a way that you don't actually realize it until you see it from the beginning again; you really do get that immersed in it!<br/><br/>I rarely agree with some of the IMDb ratings and hype, but this is one show that deserves every single bit of praise it's been given.<br/><br/>And even if you are one of those "macho" man's man kind of guys, don't worry, your buddies will understand if you shed a tear by the end of the series :) I saw this when in came out on HBO in 2001 and few years later got the DVD set for Christmas. I cannot say enough about it but it is my favorite mini-series, bar none. We first meet E Company during training at Camp Toccoa Georgia in 1942 and go with them all the way to the end of the war. The characters that most awed me the most were Dick Winters, especially during the Normandy campaign and later in Holland following Market Garden. Next would be Carwood Lipton's role as First Sergeant in holding the company together during the bloody Ardennes campaign for which he later receives a commission. After that Ron Spiers' do or die determination and leadership displayed during Normandy and the Ardennes campaigns. What makes them particularly awesome is the fact that they are real men and heroes who actually performed as shown in the movie, not just characters in a movie. The movie pulls no punches and calls it generally how it was. We see some poor leaders come and go, what could be called a mutiny, and the implied field execution of some German POW's. I will also say that there are some disparities between the book and the mini-series. Not enough to be significant in the greater scheme of things, though. I look at Band of Brothers (BoB) as neither a show or a movie, but rather simply a story that must be told.<br/><br/>It is filmmaking at its finest. BOB is truly as close to perfection in the vast field of film as anything I have ever seen. The pace, the music, the acting, the direction, the authenticity, the drama, and the excitement are all first rate.<br/><br/>If you have not seen this series you definitely should. I can not say enough good things about it. But...I guess we would expect nothing less with Steven Spielberg's touch.<br/><br/>It is so easy to be sucked into this story, that never lets up. You could even argue that the non-combat scenes are even better than the war sequences because we grow and manifest with these characters and this brotherhood. As a huge fan of Tom Hanks' work in Saving Private Ryan, I found Band of Brothers to be equally impressive. It doesn't romanticize the war like many earlier Hollywood portrayals. It shows the human cost up close and personal and gives a realistic insight into the emotional trauma that war, especially WW 2, inflicts on the individual. And it shows clearly how the strains and demands of combat affects soldiers differently. Some manage to remain composed while their friends are killed, others freeze up in sheer terror under horrific enemy fire, while others seem hell bent on killing every German soldier personally. Band of Brothers is extremely well written, well directed, and most importantly, well acted. I would recommend this mini-series for everyone to see, to see what the cost of freedom actually looks like. Band of Brothers is an amazing story based on the book by Steven Ambrose and produced by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, both who previously worked on Saving Private Ryan. The ten part miniseries for the small screen is a grand spectacle on every level, it delivers breathtaking moments of pure action, and standstill moments to understand the characters that you grow to live and die with (not literally). Band of Brothers tells the story of Easy Company, which was part of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the United States Army during World War Two. The story follows the lives, friendships, hardships, changes and turmoils that each member of Easy Company had to endure.<br/><br/>The series delivers a realistic experience of Easy Company from their final stages of their paratrooper training, to D-day; through their major battles up until the end of the war. The story starts at Camp Toccoa, Georgia where you first see the company being yelled at by their commanding officer. Before each episode begins, the real members of Easy Company who are being directly played by actors are introduced to the responder who talk about their experiences on what the episode focuses on. The psychological impact the series has on you is outstanding, Steven Spielberg manages to capture the very soul of each soldier, and it gives a good portrait of what war must be like for those who actually fight it. Each episode spotlights one or more of the men. In doing so it gives the audience a chance to view the soldiers on a more personal level, and not just their heroics. The mini-series does not shy away from the brutal, ugly reality of combat, from the murder of German prisoners, to the cowardly soldier hiding away in his mind. No, this is not John Wayne standing tough and courageous on a hill at Iwo Jima, these are real men and Band of Brothers does well to show that not all soldiers were courageous; all were scared, so much so that some were rendered worthless.<br/><br/>The producers HBO have always been known to produce works of art such as the likes of "the Sopranos" and "61*" and Band of Brothers does not stop to depress anyone but continues this tradition. The special effects that Band of Brothers delivers to your home are leagues in front of any war movie produced. The intentional grain subdued colours and contrast is well balanced, and is accompanied by heavy filters that make up for that gritty look of war. If you are after detail you will be amazed at the two episodes that are featured around the snow and cold of Bastogne known also as the battle of the bulge. The snow, which slowly descends down around the soldiers, gives a magical 3D effect and appearance, almost has a peaceful feel, it is as if each snow flake is captured and rendered on camera. But that peace is quickly blown away, the battle of the bulge is known for the bombardment from artillery guns and relentless attacking the Germans threw at these soldiers, when the shells start exploding, trees begin breaking and blowing apart, well, Spielberg and Hanks really made this place seem like "hell on earth" as some described it. This is essentially where you begin to hear the crystal Dolby Digital surround sound, ironically one of the soldiers made the comparison with the 4th of July when the bombs were exploding around them. Ambient sounds such as crackling of the snow under the feet, troops preparing for departure, tanks and vehicles sound demonic in the distance as if death is approaching closer; the sound is so well captured that at one stage you can hear the cold brakes of the vehicles grinding.<br/><br/>The use of camera techniques is something that I have never seen capture the theme of a movie so perfect that it could be out of this world, yet Spielberg and Hanks have managed to succeed in this area as well. The use of camera techniques such as long shots that embrace the battlefield to show its demonic beauty and transitions that seem to fade away peacefully only for the next scene to erupt with explosions and cries for 'medic'! One feature that I enjoy is how up close the directors can come to soldiers in the heat of battle the use of simply holding the camera by your side or on your shoulder makes room for that essence of reality and is used wisely in the directing of this series and helps the two directors capture everything from the tight corridors of a trench to a hundred thousand German prisoners marching in a line (where the dolly shot came in handy). The angles used capture every detail and no shot gets in the way of detail; detail as far as explosions and stray bullets causing mud to get stuck on the camera lens.<br/><br/>In my own opinion Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks managed to produce with the help of HBO an epic masterpiece which is joyful to see come to the small screen as a television series. The movie serves its purpose for veterans and people of today's age in still reminding us of the struggles that people had to endure in order for freedom to prevail and peace to return to the people which had long cried out for it and the justice that accompanied it. I give it a well deserved 10/10. I watched Band of Brothers for the second time a few days ago after buying the DVD and it thrilled me as much as the first time. I think the performances of the actors, directors, the incredible realism, the technical effects are just perfect, and the film becomes absolutely moving and entertaining and the same time. The best film experience I've ever had in front of a screen. As a European, I think that what the Americans did in WWII is amazing and we should all be grateful, and I invite those who criticize the Americans, that certainly have many defects, but also a lot of good things, to watch first Saving Private Ryan, and Second, the UNBELIEVABLE Band of Brothers (definitely better than the also great SPR), and after watching it, maybe the'll not speak about the Americans in such bad words and will admit that they also have a lot of virtues. America is a mix of ethnics from all over the world, like the mix we see in the soldiers of the Easy Company, that, like the Roman Empire, has proved to be very successful and the most powerful country in the world, and also like the Roman Empire, has proved to have important defects that should be corrected before they end like the Roman Empire did, which I personally, hope that never happens. My deepest respect to all the soldiers who fought with the Allies in WWII. The best depiction of war ever committed to film. I'm hoping for a second series although I fear this is unlikely. Why can't there be more productions made of this quality?? Everything from the dialogue, special effects and action sequences is astonishingly good. The attention to detail is outstanding, indeed throughout the series I felt utterly submersed in a WWII time-capsule. The characters are interesting, and more importantly believable. Throughout the DVDs you will start to feel as if you are 'getting to know' the individual characters and in turn, will start to take an interest in their well being. Fantastic to see veterans involved in the making also, this adds a real feeling of authenticity. The only criticism I have is that there were not more episodes! A must for anybody interested in WWII or anybody who simply enjoys really well made Television. 10/10 I rarely give movies a 10 on IMDb but I have never before seen anything that deserved it as much as BOB. I can honestly say this was the best piece of film-making that I've ever seen. From its inception, BOB is captivating, exciting and extremely touching. My grandfather was in most of the battles in this series, including Battle of the Bulge, which probably made it more personal for me. He actually watched the series recently and agreed with me that it was truly a masterpiece. The series uses relatively unknown actors (who do a fantastic job), which gives it a more realistic feel. The character development is well-done. You grow very attached to each person and feel for Easy Company when a man is lost. I was brought to tears in a few of the episodes. Basically, if you haven't seen BOB, I strongly implore you to do so. The scope, depth, and attention to detail of this 10 episode miniseries are awe inspiring. Though they share some big name producers, Band of Brothers makes Saving Private Ryan look like a cartoon. The story is compelling and accessible, yet it demands the viewer's active attention, and every episode rewards repeated viewing. Despite the enormous cast, acting is consistently of the highest quality. BoB is so good that you may forget that you already know how WWII comes out. In every scene, you see what's happening as the soldiers themselves saw it. BoB recalls the grandeur of WWII movies made in the 50's and 60's, yet it focuses unflinchingly on the price paid by the soldier, including the intense psychological damage done by combat. By the end, you may have slightly different definitions of valor and courage. An achievement; a demonstration of what can be done in the medium of television; absolutely not to be missed. This is the best movie/TV series i have ever seen. It was an emotional experience you can't even imagine. Trust me, this will move you. One of the reasons I think it is so powerful is that this isn't Hollywood-- it's real life. It's not some fake phony story some director in Hollywood decided to make to get more money-it's real. The people, the characters actually existed, actually did all the things they portray in the series. They're personality's arn't some thought up being put on film, these people are all real. It is hard to imagine how much these guys did, and how brave they were. This series is truly amazing. I think it is the best thing ANYONE could ever put on film. It is truly incredible. No words to describe this series.<br/><br/>Possibly the best WWII film/series in film history to this date.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and watch the series in its entirety FIRST, then go back and watch the "Making of" special bonus section of the DVD. You will learn the small intricacies of the actors and their characters, how they were cast into their roles, how they were trained, and commentary that transports you back (in your imagination) to when you were watching the series...making you fully appreciate what you had watched in each episode.<br/><br/>I say this because some people watch the bonus material FIRST and then they watch the main feature. I cannot imagine watching the bonus material first and THEN watching the feature because it would have made me focus on "looking" for the details instead of enjoying the natural progression of watching the series. There was something curiously satisfying about watching the entire feature, and then learning about what I had just viewed.<br/><br/>Very simply: It's such a good experience. Well worth the time and the money. Do yourself a favor and purchase it. As an avowed pacifist, I normally shy away from war movies, and have to be coaxed into watching a good one by someone who knows my tastes in films (i.e. "The Thin Red Line," which blew me away). Finally breaking down under the pressure of friends, I rented "Band of Brothers," and surprised even myself by watching the entire series in one sitting. Riveting, eloquent, evocative, stark, gritty, and often times a testament to bloody hell, "Band of Brothers" is a magnificent retelling of the elite group of paratroopers comprising Easy Company, 506th Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division, United States Army, who began their incredible journey dropping from the sky in an unimaginable hail of parachutes into Normandy on D-Day, June 6, 1944. What follows is a breathtaking account of their numerous battles, victories and defeats, and of the crippling injuries endured and of the lives lost on the battlefield. Each segment opens with interviews by actual survivors of Easy Company, each recalling a moment or articulating a remembered feeling, their elderly eyes alight with a memory, or awash with tears. Superb acting by each and every member of the massive ensemble, including Scott Grimes as the likable and ever-cheerful Donald Malarkey, Donnie Wahlberg as the stalwart Lt. Lipton, Ron Livingston as Capt. Nixon, and Frank John Hughes as the wise-guy "Wild Bill" "Gonorrhea" Guarnere, to name only a few. At the helm of the troop is Maj. Richard Winters; in an extraordinary, understated performance by British actor Damian Lewis, Winters is a true leader  quietly courageous, imbued with inherent compassion and a heroic sense of humanity.  There are so many stunning moments in the series that it is impossible to single one or two out. Suffice it to say that "Band of Brothers" is impressively mounted, to grossly understate the case, and is wonderfully tied together with a majestic, haunting, goosebump-inducing score composed by Michael Kamen. This series is nothing short of a masterpiece. **Warning! Mild Plot Spoilers Ahead!**<br/><br/>The format of "BoB" (10-hour, 10-part miniseries) gave it an advantage over typical films.  The length allowed characters to be developed more than usual, as different ones were featured in different ways in each hour.  The episodic nature of "BoB" allowed various stories to be told.  These stories added up to one phenomenal tale following the exploits of Easy Company on the European front in World War II.  <br/><br/>Another reason that this miniseries works so well is the anonymity of most of its cast.  I only knew of the previous work of two of the actors (David Schwimmer and Ron Livingston), so accepting the actors as their characters was zero trouble.  Now when I see them in other work, I can't get past their "BoB" characters...but I digress.  <br/><br/>The sheer volume of people in the cast makes tracking each guy a little tricky (I'm sure that upon a second viewing, I'll pick up on many character arcs that  I missed the first time),  but you learn more every episode, and you know the primaries by the middle of the miniseries. <br/><br/>
The battle scenes are superb.  Think "Saving Private Ryan," improve the quality, and expand the length by a factor of five.  There you go.  The scenes are more effective because you know the characters better than in SPR, and you think of them more as the characters rather than actors. <br/><br/>
BoB provides pictures of not only the war itself, but boot camp prior to the invasion and the decompressing process at the end of the war.  The first and last episodes provide perfect bookends to an historic event. <br/><br/>
My only minor complaint is a judgment call, an error of omission.  Two or three times when an episode faded into subtitles that explained what happened next, usually in a key battle (like the Battle of the Bulge), I wanted to see those conflicts.  I suppose that showing those is less needed since the public is more familiar with those encounters.  Additionally those might have been thought of as not advancing the characters as much as providing fascinating visuals.  A quibble, but a minor one. <br/><br/>
Bottom Line:  Band of Brothers is the best thing I've ever seen.  Period. I'm not arguing about this.  10 of 10. I usually don't get into war movies (Gettysburg and Behind Enemy Lines being the two exceptions) but there is something about Band of Brothers that drew me in immediately. I read that the cast was picked, not only on talent, but on physical resemblance to the men they are playing, and the casting department did amazing. In looking at pictures of the real men you can hardly tell the difference. Band of Brothers really makes you care about these men, and care what happens to them. For anybody who likes war movies, or even for people who like a good drama, check out Band of Brothers. It might be long, but it's definitely worth the time.<br/><br/>Erin The best part of Saving private Ryan was the D-Day landing scenes. they were so emotionally powerful, after seeing the young kid holding his major organs and screaming for his mother,a soldier casually pick up his right arm, a flamethrower burst and engulf three soldiers I felt a lump in my throat and a tear in my eye.<br/><br/>Band of Brothers takes these scenes and stretches them over a mini-series, but without feeling repetetive. The series is thankfully devoid of OTT Speilberg sentimentality.The scenes in Bastogne (where the company are really hit hard) really bring home the horror of war (I know it's a cliche but anyway). having the veterans speak also enhances this feeling.All in all a brilliant series.<br/><br/>10/10 I have seen more movies than someone 3 times my age.  And this is by far the best mini-series and one of the best productions I have ever seen. This goes out to the fact Tom & Steven were the exec's, but the stories that were presented were what really stood out.  It didn't hurt that the production values (which were top notch) and the budget were not an issue. (I heard it cost a 100 million to produce.)  Overall, even if you aren't someone that enjoys war films, this is a masterpiece in all respects. I don't even know how to talk about how wonderful this series is.  All i can say is that it needs to be seen.  And the men who are involved in this film, both the real men and the actors, are the real deal, and the men that fought in this terrible war, are what the word hero defines. I remember growing up in my grandparents house and listening to the "war stories" my grandfather told about his WWII experiences in Europe.   I just purchased this series on DVD and I wish he were still alive to see if this brings some justice to the story of those who were there.  I can't watch these episodes without getting teary-eyed from the realization of what he must have gone through.  All the pieces of places and events he mentioned came together for me as I watched this.  His stories of the Battle of the Bulge and the coldest he'd ever been in his life just came to life on the screen.  Perhaps the most touching and impacting part of this series is the prologue by the veterans who were actually there.  It is very emotional to watch an 80-year-old man on the verge of tears remembering his friends who he watched die next to him...when he was an 18 year old kid.  Of course all wars have this tragedy.  But it's impacting nonetheless... especially since this is one of the few portrayals of the reality of combat in WWII without the whitewash found in so many Hollywood movies.  I can't recommend Band of Brothers highly enough.  In addition to "Saving Private Ryan," this is the simply the best portrayal of the G.I. experience in WWII that I have ever seen. Period.  My advice is to make the time in your life to watch this series.  If you have a parent, a grandparent or a relative who fought in Europe in WWII, then this will show you what they went through (OK sorry, there isn't coverage of the Italian/Sicilian campaign...this is northern Europe).  I feel a new appreciation for my grandfather and what he did, even though he is now only a cherished memory. I cannot explain in words how much I love this mini series. I rented all of them over a period of a few weeks (I don't get HBO). I read the book long before the movies came out and found that the movie is very faithful and captures much of the detail. The book holds a special place for me, and I can say the series lived up to it. The acting is generally very good. The cinematography is beautiful All the episodes are excellent except I found myself liking some more than others. I loved "Day of Days" (Episode 2) but I found that "Carentan" (Episode 3) was sort of weird and disjointed. Still, they all are worth your time. The score is also excellent, especially the main score. It's haunting and amazing.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie was an excellent tribute to Easy Company and all of the men of the ETO and the WWII generation.<br/><br/>10/10 I would have to say that this is by far the best mini-series that has ever been filmed.  I read that it was a 120 million dollar budget, and you can see every penny of it on screen, with both the scenery, and the actors. Everyone of these many actors did a fantastic job in portraying the real members of EZ company.  I felt throughout the series that I got to know each and every one of the main characters and their development through out. Bravo Mr. Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks, and the numerous directors that were involved! One of the best things I've ever watched. Hanks and Spielberg have done a brilliant job and the cast, especially Eion Bailey, are exceptional. Do yourself a favour and check it out, over and over and over. This is one series to remember! First of all let me give a rating to this masterpiece. This series deserves a 10/10, for it's vastness, it's gripping and sometimes choking storytelling, it's portrayal of human struggling in it's most extreme form. Special recommendation goes to the episodes 6 & 7, which are a fantastic bit of storytelling through beautiful portrayal of humanitary horror unsurpassed in cinematic history to my knowledge<br/><br/>But I'd like to comment on the remarks I've read in a surprising abundance here. The series wouldn't be realistic because of the fact that American heroïsm is over-dramatized and frankly overdone.<br/><br/>First of all, Americans (the soldiers) didn't free countries like mine (Holland) out of personal gain, which in our book makes them heroes. They were willing to give their lives in order to rid our nations from Nazism. Where is this not heroïc?<br/><br/>Secondly, and most importantly with regards to the series itself, the final episode where the German officer addresses his men, eerily striking the exact same points which binds Winters and all the others and the whole series itself. This being said by a Nazi commander rids all nationalism from the series. The common man just fights, that's the point..... If BAND OF BROTHERS was made to show the gut wrenching cruelty of war it certainly succeeds . My god what a thoroughly depressing series full of scenes that will make your jaw drop . A young German not a day over 15 looks an American officer in the eye just before he is shot dead . Another German soldier falls wounded under the path of a tank and is crushed to death and German POWs are routinely shot dead . We also see soldiers on both sides with their limbs blown off and soldiers being killed by friendly fire and the whole bleak atmosphere of this series feels like we've been transported to the era of Vietnam or even to the first world war where slaughter felt like slaughter instead of a moral crusade . That's right we look upon the second world war as a crusade against Nazism as if that lessens the carnage and sacrifice people experienced in those days as if that made their deaths and injuries less painful or traumatic in some way <br/><br/>As superb as BOB is on a technical and amoral level I couldn't award the series more than seven out of ten . This is down to to the fact that once again we're seeing a somewhat Americancentric view of history and there's a massive irony that this is an Anglo-American co-production between the BBC and HBO . I've lost count of the times I've read on this site that " Hey the guy playing Winters is English , and so are most of the cast , they're accents are perfect " so why is it we once again see Uncle Sam racing single handed to save the world from Nazism ? The opening episode features a cockney geezer and some gunners in the background ( The implication being that the Brits sat on their asses while the Americans parachuted into Normandy ) , an idiotic tank commander in episode four ( That's the episode where the Americans jeer Monty ) and a dead British officer in the final episode . To be fair episode four features an end caption pointing out that during operation marketgarden the British airborne division had 80% casualties but anyone watching BOB without any primary knowledge of the second world war will believe that the second world war was mainly a conflict between America and Nazi Germany with no one else doing much . Even the series tagline of " The world depended on them " churns up feelings that this series in some ways is little different from an Errol Flynn / John Wayne actioner and this series is far too good for that comparison <br/><br/>I'm not trying to sound anti-American . I often receive messages from Americans on the subject of conflicts and most of them show themselves to be open minded and intelligent . I'm not criticising America but I am criticising the original source by Stephen Ambrose who has made serious factual mistakes . One notorious instance is that after the show was broadcast the family of Albert Blithe came forward to point out that he didn't die from wounds in 1947 but made a full recovery and was still in the army 20 years later when he died from natural causes . Another error is that Hitler's Berchtesgarden was captured by the 101st airborne division when in fact it was captured by the American 7th infantry regiment . If Ambrose can make fundamental mistakes like this then what other historical errors feature in BOB ? <br/><br/>In short BOB is a graphic testimony to the vile ugliness of war . It's certainly a good series but one can't help thinking it's rather poor history . Perhaps IMDb voters who have praised this as the definitive feature of the second world war may like to read up on more history books like Max Hastings flawed but compelling Armageddon or Corneilus Ryan's trilogy of THE LONGEST DAY , A BRIDGE TOO FAR and THE LAST BATTLE for a wider picture of what was happening in Europe 1944-45 As a glossy, moving tribute to the men that served, it works very well. No-one could doubt the individual acts of heroism and brotherhood scattered throughout the war. But surely the makers owe these guys a balanced representation of the bigger picture?<br/><br/>The tribute is diminished somewhat by the unnecessary pro-American overkill. So we are treated to faceless Germans behaving like the Marx brothers and Brits lazily portrayed as incompetent footnotes to history. Even the European resistance fighters are treated with faint disdain. Issues such as the US's non-involvement during the first few years of the war and the massive British/ non-American losses are either ignored or tagged on as a magnanimous after-thought, at the end of the episode.<br/><br/>I suppose what Im saying is, where is the respect? Plenty for the square-jawed, handsome good-guys (ie. Americans) but not an awful lot left over for anyone else... I'm not sure what the genuine good-guys would have made of that. I first saw this in 2001 when it was on HBO. I was living in England and saw each episode every week they were aired. I bought the DVD box set in the metal container a few years later and binge-watched it in two days. Every few years since then, I make it a point to watch it. It just helps renew my soul to do so. A few weeks ago I was lucky enough to score a combination Band of Brothers/The Pacific Blu ray box set at a thrift store for 5 bucks. I just finished watching it again. I cannot get tired of it. Everything about the production is superb and hats off to anyone still alive or deceased who fought in that war in both theaters. In this highly dishonorable and partisan world we live in now, this show makes me forget about it, for a little while at least.<br/><br/>But I also think about how impossible it would be for HBO to produce something as masterful as Band of Brothers in this day and age, when it seems that their only desire is to make ultra liberal racially charged WOKE propaganda designed to piss off everyone instead of entertain them. One of my favorite episodes was number five, particularly the subway scene and the scene where the men are getting ready for the final advance and see the enormous line of soldiers falling back, having been ambushed and their numbers decimated. The subway scene is one of the best ones in the entire series that illustrates the connection between the battlefield and civilian life. Major Winters, played by Damian Lewis who later makes a huge left turn in his acting career, playing Jonesy in Stephen King's Dreamcatcher, reluctantly accepts a weekend pass to spend some time in Paris, and while on a subway train he looks around at the other passengers and each face brings him a flashback from the battlefield, one of which being the soldier that he runs into after coming over a hill and, while the man signals his helplessness, shoots dead with one shot (okay, three shots, for effect).<br/><br/>
At first this might look a little cheesy, the hardened soldier getting his first look at relatively normal society after so long on the battlefield, but that is exactly what it was like for these guys (NOTE: I have never been in battle and so have no basis for saying that last sentence). The thing that I liked was that he saw these people on the subway and was reminded of dramatic moments in battle involving people that looked like them. So yeah, I may never have been in battle or served any time in the military, but I love this connection between civilian life and the battlefield, because it is something that the audience of a war film often does not do until they leave the theater or turn off the film, and the effect is intensified when it is one of the actual characters in the film making that connection himself (NOTE: I've seen tons of war films and so have plenty of basis for saying that last sentence). It is moments like this that really make you see the severity of what these guys went through.<br/><br/>In the scene with the retreating soldiers, we see the ironically named Easy Company awaiting their orders to advance, with little ammunition, food, or winter clothing, and when they see this line of soldiers retreating it takes them several seconds before they think to start grabbing ammunition and rations off of these guys because of the shock of what they're seeing. I could hardly stand to see them let a single soldier walk by without taking his ammo and grenades and everything, but then again, these guys are faced with a whole line full of revelations that they're almost certainly about to walk to their deaths, so they were probably not thinking quite as clearly as I was. <br/><br/>In casually perusing other reviews of Band of Brothers, I'm glad that not many people are simply comparing it to Saving Private Ryan, because even though Spielberg was the executive producer and Tom Hanks was a director, it is really not in the shadow of Saving Private Ryan. This is an outstanding rendering of the true stories of Easy Company during World War II, and I'm happy to see that so many people have recognized that. It's hard to follow up a movie like Saving Private Ryan that is about the same topic without being immediately compared to that movie, but since Band of Brothers has done it to a large extent, I think it's a testament to the quality of the miniseries itself.<br/><br/>Band of Brothers has set all kinds of records for the small screen, and smartly avoids mostly all of the clichés that are seen in so many war films, even clichés of the great films like Private Ryan (such as stereotypical characters that have stereotypical relationships with each other) or of the bad ones, like Pearl Harbor (such as the obligatory romances, the loved ones left behind, etc). Band of Brothers is a very straightforward and shockingly graphic and detailed description of the hardships that these men endured while performing their service to America, hardships which are only dulled and pushed aside by the greedy pulling of emotional heartstrings by Hollywood executives. Each episode opens with interviews with several of the actual men from Easy Company talking about some of the experiences that that episode deals with, and these interviews are fleshed out even more in a sixth DVD which should not be overlooked! <br/><br/>This is an outstanding achievement. Yes, it's roughly ten hours long, but that allows an even better opportunity to get to know the characters, and the episodes are designed so that you become connected to them as people, not as characters, and their experiences are presented in such starling detail and realism that it is virtually impossible not to be moved. BoB is extremely well cast, directed, produced etc miniseries, fine example of big-spending TV production. No way denying that. But the story itself is way overrated. And the point of view on all things is all Stars and Stripes and Apple pie.<br/><br/>Just like in Saving Private Ryan, BoB makes the Germans look like blindfolded turkeys, goofing around in American gunfire, while the Americans are the ones with any skills for example in even the most basic infantry tactics. And yes, they show you the concentration camps and the holocaust, but not a word is mentioned about carpet napalm-bombings of German civilians, great cities like Dresden or Berlin.<br/><br/>And an another thing: it is made to seem so terrible when the Easy boys are surrounded in Bastogne in winter time and it's a bit cold and they're taking casualties... for about, what, two weeks? Four? Try spending a few winters in eastern front, see whole divisions get annihilated in very short periods of time.<br/><br/>I'm not saying war would be nice to anyone, I'm saying this series just isn't too exact on putting things into proper historical perspective. It pretty much feels nothing for the opponent, and thus gives the audience the idea that it's right when Americans kill people, but not the other way around; the Germans are posed not as people but just wicked bad cold blooded Nazis who deserve to be shot to pieces. Well guess what, they were humans also. And, looking at the odds throughout the war, they fought extremely well.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, in the final episode there is this cheesy chapter were they show you the enemy even for a while... very awful scene. Really puts the Hollywood in to military. There were just a few (if any) realistically written or played officers, German or American, in the whole series. Instead, there were these supercheesy over-sentimental officer look-a-likes (again reminded me of Saving Private Ryan and the high ranking general weeping like a little girl with that letter from Abe Lincoln... yeah, right!). If officers in any army were like that there would be no wars, but they're not. Anyone actually been in any army can confirm that much. Check it out. And yes, I've been there myself.<br/><br/>BoB was very entertaining, but not realistic, save the clothing and maybe some special effects. And the moral issues... when a man kills an other man, its always a murder. We are all responsible for stopping each other from doing that. And this means you America! Stopping a murder by becoming a murderer isn't right even when it seems to be the only choice.<br/><br/>And then there was this episode "Why We Fight"... really, what they give you is an excuse, not an answer. Because of the holocaust? No. Everyone knew the Soviets were going to win the war by themselves, so it was imperative for allies to protect their interests in mainland of Europe. Result: Operation Overlord. So, the reason why so many Americans fought and died there was the same reason that got the war started in the first place: Politics.<br/><br/>Now get this: If you want to make an anti-war movie (or series or whatever) you also have to make it anti-political, including ALL politics (nazis got to power through democratic election). BoB failed in all that. Suklaata ja Amerikkaa. Like Saving Private Ryan Band of Brothers is primarily aimed at an US market feeding and feeding on US idea's about the war. The US cast is lifelike but all others are stereotypes. Band of Brothers has a more realistic outlook but this doesn't make it more true.<br/><br/>"You should see this." A friend of mine told me, knowing my interest in warfare and in particular World War II. So I did. <br/><br/>I think Band of Brothers is a mixed bag. The episodes range from the great to the indifferent. The attack on the German battery is really great stuff. Some episodes are just plain boring, with long stretches that almost nothing seems to happen, except for the main characters just babbling along. Some are just plain unbelievable:the Ardennes episode has a moment that the main character has an 'almost' love scene. Okay, so there is this really beautiful young single Belgian woman located in Bastogne surrounded by lot's and lot's of young American soldiers and she has a romantic moment with a soldier that just came in from the front? Nice also that she is able to talk English in an area that is French mostly. A bit contrived to say the least. <br/><br/>Some episodes are just plain wrong. There is this scene during the Market Garden episode that an English armored column moves up. Some of the US Airborne warn them that there is tiger-tank hiding behind a building in a haystack. The English tank commander says something like, "I can't see it" and orders his tank forward. The tiger then moves up and whacks the tank. This is the totality of the English role in this episode. I blushed with shame at this scene. This was just a plain lie. First thing: there were no tigers in the area the us airborne operated. The tigers where collected in separate units that where usually at the disposal of a corps. Invariably this was an armored corps. The only unit in Holland that could have possessed them was the II SS panzer-corps which operated between Arnhem and Nijmegen. However this corps had been badly mauled during it's retreat from France. It was therefore ordered to refit and hand over it's assets to other armored unit's including it's remaining tiger tanks. <br/><br/>We can of course assume the movie maker took some liberty to make the scene more interesting and in reality it was another kind of tank. But even then I think you might really think twice to display such a inept move on the part of the English. It might be that an US Airborne told this story, but I doubt that it was true the way it was told. Some disliked the English, so in their idea this dumb move could well have been done by them. Then, after telling and retelling the story, what could have been, had happened because it makes such a nice story to tell. <br/><br/>In addition much of the US airborne where convinced that if they had been dropped at Arnhem, then there would have been a greater change of success. I think this to be a valid point. (the us where more aggressive, more experienced as compared this particular UK airborne unit and more willing to take risks(like dropping nearer to the Arnhem bridge)). The idea that the English were not up to scratch was fueled by this idea and so the idea that English made mistakes(and the US did not). Contrastingly, there is an proved incident of an English tank unit which supported the US airborne in counter attacks with great success during Market Garden(I think the tank-crew got an American award for this). Why was the rumor chosen and the fact not mentioned? <br/><br/>Band of brothers is at it's best when the focus is on the US cast. The same sort of realism as in Saving Private Ryan is also displayed here with drab clothing, more realistic equipment and realistic outlook(people get dirty when lying in the mud). Yet like in Saving Private Ryan this is realism up to a point. The Germans are more historically equipped, but still have the same role as they had in any of the other movies. Displaying the same frontal attacks, bunching tanks and armored units in strange formations, dying like flies. What others there are in the movie are still stereotypes. <br/><br/>Band of Brothers is therefore nice to look at with some great moments, but balanced by boring, unbelievable and shameful bits. BoB is great!!!! I was so curious, I had to look for myself. I was rather surprised.. <br/><br/>One of my problems was that I could not connect to the story as the characters were changed with every episode. It looked more like a dramatized documentary than a gripping story.<br/><br/>I also found the mood heavily sentimental. At regular intervals you would be confronted by a sad-looking GI, pondering the horror of it all, but then at the next moment ready to do his bit because his fellows depended on him, as he depended on them: they were after all; a band of brothers. <br/><br/>I also had problems with the role of the 'europeans'. If they appeared at all, it was in a vague and distant manner, more props then real live persons. More to spark a scene of thoughtful pondering, than to give them their own piece to act. There was a foolishness English tank-commander who was blown to pieces by a tiger despite being warned by the valiant Americans. Had he but listened to them, he would still be alive This event echo's the remark made at the beginning of the episode by one of the vet's: if we had been dropped at Arnhem, the operation would have been a success.<br/><br/>Then there was the Belgian damsel, who's only role seem to be to give the protagonist of the episode a moment of sadness. Cruel was fate, snuffing out the live of one so young and beautiful. The Germans had the obvious role allotted to them, like Indians in cowboy series, like Vietcong in Nam series and Russians in cold war movies. As all the baddies do: they stand up, march forward and get gunned down by droves. If they temporarily seem to win it was because there were too many of them or they had tanks. If they lose it was because they had to, faced by the superior Americans. This is underscored by the fact that the only German to rise above the role of target and have more line's than 'argg' or 'scheise' happened to be an German-American who joined the Germans. Eventually as Germans go, he was killed too. Of course triggering another dark moody pondering moment: how cruel was the fate setting up two country-man against each other.<br/><br/>At last I found some part of the series plain boring, especially the episode one called bastogne. A large part of the episode we follow the leading character, a medic, wandering through the woods from one place to the other. Nothing really happens.<br/><br/>I all: it's a reasonable series, but hardly worth high praise.. Comparing this to Saving Private Ryan or any number of great war movies, I was struck by the way they chose to handle fear in the characters.<br/><br/>It seems like there is only anxiety, which comes and goes, as a reaction to contact with the enemy. Even though they are coming up against German paratroopers and SS units (both notoriously competent and well motivated), the treatment of the Germans is like "dose rascally krauts, HAHA".<br/><br/>The Germans are portrayed as mostly hapless and the BoB as almost omnipotent, even though casualties are taken regularly. In better war movies or even suspense movies, the sense of corrosive long term fear is portrayed more dramatically. The smooth, unlined faces and "Laid Back" attitudes project an atmosphere of drudgery albeit bloody drudgery.<br/><br/>Just look at the makeup on the characters in "Ryan" compared to these. In BoB they look constantly fresh and mostly clean---the main exception being the camouflage face paint they wore in early episodes.<br/><br/>It is one of the most profound rules of drama:<br/><br/>The good guy can only be a good or brave as the bad guy is truly evil or frightening. The enemy in this movie is distant and not scary. The ones we see up close are dealt with quickly or if they are goofy enough to surrender they are mowed down.<br/><br/>"Stupid Krauts, what clowns" With only a couple of exceptions the Americans seem to out-think and out-fight all the Germans they come across. It builds an atmosphere of Inevitabilty that lessens suspense rather than building it.<br/><br/>No portrayal of great heroism comes from bashing clowns around. In the recreation of historical facts personal memory should always be reconsidered with the greatest care. Every decent historian knows that. Especially in the traumatic surroundings of the battlefield the own experience is often strongly blurred. That's why history books don't read like adventure stories. War isn't "real" so it can be reconstructed. War takes place. That's a big difference.<br/><br/>It seems that what Spielberg and Hanks wanted to do is to give history its share of adventure at all costs. By intending this they accomplished a glossy pro-war-movie for the kids to enjoy. When you read the comments on this platform there is much talk about "reality". I wonder that so many veterans seem to meet in the IMDb. Maybe they do. Maybe it's just a bunch of schoolboys who like to discuss if the used weapons sounded right. Needless to say that this kind of attitude is disgusting, even when cultivated by little boys looking for attention. <br/><br/>It's even more disgusting how "BOB" delivers for this very kind of audience. The action-like but naive (and wrongly) reconstructed fighting tableaux, the strong use of over-sentimental music which tells the viewer exactly how to feel, the urge to portray the soldiers as "ordinary man" fighting for a better world. All this elements reveal that BOB is the propaganda of our time. Most likely appreciated by the modern "ordinary men" fighting for "peace" in Iraq, right know. <br/><br/>So if your out for revenge, blood & guts on a very sentimental journey which doesn't force you to think about people killing themselves this is the right thing for you. If you have 780 Minutes of spare time. <br/><br/>For those interested in some unsentimental (and therefore more profound) memories: read "Something about a soldier" by Charles Willeford. <br/><br/>P.S.: Most of the German language spoken in this series is laughably wrong. But as long as the MG's are rattling the right way that doesn't seem to matter much. Band of Brothers can teach us many things, teach us that all human beings can share their feelings, can teach us we all have specific goals, we all have a long story, we can all keep our emotions to the last. I really recommend watching it. Really interesting and classic you won't want to miss it! I bought the book as soon as the credits started to roll. I guess I just wasn't ready to let the story of these brave men go, and I wanted to see how different the miniseries was from the book.<br/><br/>Band of Brothers: E Company, 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne From Normandy to Hitler's Eagle's Nest follows the men of Easy Company from when they were trained to be paratroopers at Camp Toccoa in 1942 until the company was disbanded in 1945 in the months following the end of World War II. Stephen E. Ambrose, using information gathered during interviews with some of the surviving members of E Company, begins by detailing the grueling training exercises and excessive discipline they endured under a captain they couldn't stand and who probably would get them killed when they went into battle. He chronicles the tension leading up to the chaotic D-Day jump into Normandy and follows the men into Holland and the freezing, snowy foxholes of Bastogne. Ambrose goes to great lengths to explain the mindset these men assumed during combat, how they managed to function and work together so well as a team to get the job done, and then how they loosened up when pulled off the front lines and began to dread having to return to the fight.<br/><br/>These men forged a bond that we can never understand, and under the leadership of Major Dick Winters - whose "follow me" approach earned him much respect and admiration - they became heroes, whether they would call themselves that or not. Ambrose doesn't paint them as saints, though, going into great detail about their drinking, pursuit of women, and all the looting that occurred when they reached Hitler's Eagle's Nest in Berchtesgaden. These men, from Winters to the Harvard English Lit major David Webster (featured in the quote at the beginning of my review), become real to readers over the course of the book. And this, coupled with Ambrose's readable writing style (which is important to me when it comes to non-fiction), is why I loved the book.<br/><br/>Band of Brothers is very descriptive in terms of military strategy (and there's a map that helped me follow the movement of the troops), but it doesn't slow the story at all or overshadow the trials and triumphs of the men of Easy Company. I can't believe how much these men endured, sitting in foxholes for weeks in the cold without proper clothing, and how most of them didn't break under the pressure and the fear. I especially liked how Ambrose updated readers on the fate of these men after the war, as I'm always curious about those things. I just wish there had been more pictures so I could have put faces to the names.<br/><br/>I think it helped that I watched the Band of Brothers miniseries first, so I could picture all the maneuvering in my mind as I was reading. Of course, some things in the book were presented differently in the miniseries or left out altogether, so I was able to go straight from watching the miniseries to reading the book without being bored. Actually, now that I've finished the book, I want to watch the miniseries again because I'm sure it will all make more sense to me now. If you had to choose between watching the miniseries or reading the book, I'd go with the miniseries because it's one of those stories that really works visually, but the book is just as captivating and shouldn't be missed This is my all time favorite movie/show/miniseries. The actors did justice in their portrayal of some truly great men. If you have any interest at all in the history of this nation, or in the hardships of war, what he this. I finished watching Band of Brothers for the first time 2 days ago and it's still in my head.<br/><br/>The cast.
The set design.
The sound editing.
The special effects.
The makeup.
The directing.<br/><br/>This show is perfection. If you haven't seen it I won't spoil anything for you. Band of Brothers is must watch for anyone who isn't adamantly opposed to war films or television.<br/><br/>It doesn't get better than this. Watch it NOW. BoB is the defining tv-series of all time.<br/><br/>The greatest tv-serie about the greatest generation.
This should and MUST be shown in all schools. I try an maje sure to watch it every few years. An incredible series about incredible, brave men. Fantastic!!!
Wow...!
Worth watch..
Soo good to se breve heart's... I have seen lot of war movies but BOB is something else.it really touched my heart every scene is stunning and its more realistic than any other war movies what I'm trying to say is it gives me a feel how real war looks like..... Direction and production of the series is great. However I feel like some scenes are too much lengthy and extended.Editing could be better. But yes it's good. The Second World War is THE conflict that defied the history the past seventy one years and rightfully so for it also the number one war in therms of Deaths, Spendings, Crimes against humanity, Inovation in the sciences like medicine, chemistry and in the VAST production of goods of any kind. This also one of the most used setting in novels, comic books, films, televisions series and documentaries. With such covering it is hard to pick a work which stands from the crowd and Band of Brothers is that and also in my top five mini-series of all time.<br/><br/>The series it is based on the novel of the same name by Stephen Ambrose and follows the E company of 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment from their training days in the Midwest to the Normandy Invasion to the Battle of the Ardennes and finally to the End of World War Two! You may not remember well each character apart from five to six main but you will love each of them and I was rooting for all of them to survive this hell on Earth. From a historical stand point, I can't say anything it is pitch perfect anything from the operations plans to the costumes and the references are spot on with not even a moment for me to cry about! <br/><br/>In terms of production Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks joint forces and I believe they though something like "Saving Private Ryan is loved and took the world by storm why not make it a 10 hours series out of it?" . After words with HBO backing them up and a crack team of co-producers and advisors for historical accuracy they projects was made and again this real life dynamic duo stormed and with 1 Golden Globe 33 others awards and 24 nominations is safe to say this series rocks! Fot it was like they took our expectations for an romantic dinner and after went all out and *beeped* theirs brains out!<br/><br/>As for the battles ,we talk about ww2 for Little Boy sake and here are intense ,wild , at times frightening and always putted me on the edge of my cheat. In the series the fighting was like Private Ryan every step of the way ,no music ,no unnecessary dialogue only the thrill of the moment and the fear of death. Also for everyone who hasn't a strong stomach preside with caution this HBO, the channel that gave us Game of Thrones ,The Sopranos, Oz ,Broadwalk Empire, Rome and True Blood ,so the ground isn't for anyone! But if you can stomach it ,then it is awesome!!!<br/><br/>High recommended for anyone alive for it has anything someone would want from a TV series and you can bench watch in a day if you want to four the 10 episodes are in total about ten hours long. Have a good one! As a former Marine who deployed to Iraq, this ten-episode mini-series is a must for my personal collection. In fact, I think it's safe to say all military personnel should have it in their collections. Even if you have little to no interest in military affairs, however, you should take the time at some point in your life to watch this series all the way through.<br/><br/>Beautifully scripted, masterfully acted, and filmed amongst breathtaking (in many different ways) cinematography, this production, which significantly contributed to HBO's fast rise as the gold standard in series quality, is an amazing portrayal of the sacrifices made by troops and of the horrors of war. A healthy dose of clips from this series was played by my instructors during training ops to drive home points about all kinds of important subjects germane to war.<br/><br/>A few random thoughts I had while watching the project: - Everyone did such a great job acting, and the character development was top-notch. Even amongst this wonderful cast, Damian Lewis stood out, followed closely by Neal McDonough.<br/><br/><ul><li>It was pretty awesome to see David Schwimmer play such a different role.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>There are countless useful lessons to be learned from this series, especially by those who hope to lead troops someday.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Why is there so much hip firing throughout the series? Isn't it a bit unrealistic to make some of these shots without looking down your sights? - I watched one of the most squared-away officers in the 101st return a salute sitting on his ass. This would not happen in the Marines. Is it different in the Army? - I understand very well the transition that one may go through in terms of how he/she thinks of the enemy during war. When you first get out there, you dehumanize them in your head in order to justify some of the things that you may have to do. After a while, however, there comes a point when you realize that your enemies are human beings, much like you, fighting out of a sense of duty, and just trying to make it out of this thing alive like you are. At least, I went through a transition like that, and this series did a good job of illustrating such a transition. Still, despite the respect that our soldiers may have gained for the Germans as a formidable fighting force made up of dedicated human soldiers, they were still Nazis. They were supporting some pretty foul principles. I'm not saying that our troops were wrong for regarding Nazi troops with the respect that they did during the conflict, but I wonder if my attitude toward Nazi soldiers would have softened even after we defeated them.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>It would be great to have a beer with one of the living members of the 101st who fought in WWII.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>After you finish watching this production, watch The Pacific. It's even better! Then again, I'm biased. :)</li></ul><br/><br/>For more reviews and a kickass podcast, check out: www.livemancave.com In an age when there are countless TV shows to watch - most of them quite good and original, you can always find something so unbelievably extra-ordinary and unique that takes your breath away. <br/><br/>In my opinion, "Band of Brothers" is a must-watch show, with great acting, filming, story, script... literally everything is great. I have watched it so far 15 times and I cannot get over it. I will never get over it.<br/><br/>The story of the men of the Easy Company (Company E), 2nd Battalion of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division, the "Screaming Eagles" is inspirational and moving.<br/><br/>An outstanding show based on an outstanding true story! Truly a jewel that can be cherished and passed on to free generations to come. Amazingly is added on top of this masterpiece of film. Amazingly true. I'm as suspect as anyone who may criticize this great nation, our government, president, or aspects of our heritage. This great privilege was not; was not God-given, but given by men like Buck Compton, Shorty Powers, Bill G., and Maj. Dick Winters and those that fought under him. Band of Brothers will ignite a passion in you that persuades patriotism, hope, and tears for those fallen. I now celebrate their honor and memory. Spielberg and Hanks; of course it's damn good. Add on the amazingly true and you've positioned yourself for the greatest film experience of ones' life. Filmmakers, actors, musicians; sure I'd like to meet. Any member of Easy Company I would meet I'd simply stand in awe and cry. The criticism melts while the pride swells. Over the last couple of years I've begun a Memorial Day tradition on IMDb by posting reviews of recently watched World War II series. In 2009, it was Frank Capra's documentary series "Why We Fight", and last year I took a look at the twenty six episodes of "Victory at Sea", an epic portrayal of the War in the Pacific. Though I decided on "Band of Brothers" a little late this year, I still managed to catch the first installment on Memorial Day itself, watching a couple more each day until finishing this morning. Unless you're watching actual combat footage from real battles, there's no more accurate depiction of the horrors of war than observing what the men of Easy Company went through beginning with the D-Day invasion of Normandy on June 6th, 1944. The series chronicles the exploits of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division from that day through the end of the war in Europe, taking a two year step back in time to the birth of the unit in Toccoa, Georgia.<br/><br/>Adding poignancy to the war time casualties as well as the heroics seen on screen, surviving members of Easy Company regularly open each of the ten episodes with brief insights into their personal experiences serving in the unit. The producers wisely kept their identities hidden until that final episode, when the members are revealed as the real life heroes portrayed in the film. I would challenge anyone to maintain a dry eye as some of these men recount their pain and horror at seeing friends dying all around them, while still maintaining their integrity to the mission at hand. It may be true that these were ordinary men who did extraordinary things, but one can't help but wonder from what depths of inner fortitude they managed to survive the ordeals they went though during the course of their campaigns.<br/><br/>Probably the most surreal episode in the series is Chapter Nine, opening with violin musicians playing amid the utter devastation of Thalem, Germany. Nearby, some of the soldiers discover a Nazi concentration camp which the Company proceeds to liberate while declaring martial law in the city. Now I don't know how the film makers did it, but the actors representing the starving, maltreated Jews in the camp looked like the real thing. With an attention to this kind of detail, "Band of Brothers" is about as close to documentary story telling as you can get after the fact. It's precisely why a quote from Staff Sergeant Darrel 'Shifty' Powers resonated so strongly with me when he said his good-bye to Major Winters upon receiving his discharge when the war was over. Accurately summing up the feelings and emotions of every member of Easy Company, Sgt. Powers states - "I just don't rightly know how I'm gonna explain all this" - to the folks back home. Band of Brothers is not the regular series broadcasted on the BBC. It is a programme that comes along and amazes you. I am truly jealous of those of you who have not yet seen it because you guys still have 10 of the most griping episodes ever made ahead of you. Each character is unique and very well crafted and although 10 episodes is not enough to know each character fully audiences can easily follow there journeys, there isn't much scope for the plot to go wrong as it follows the book very well and follows a strict plot line as oppose to random and unnecessary twists and cliff-hangers . I do agree that some episodes are not as good as others but trust me when you find your favourite episode you will be left speechless- my best episode was episode 3. And for those of you who are worried that the fast moving plot line and the many characters will leave people to confused, well you have a right to worry. I agree the plot is very fast but remember this is a war series compacted into 10 episodes it's got to be fast. And more importantly the characters, most negative reviews say that the audiences weren't able to remember the main characters names, that's true- but only for the first 3-4 episodes- and even then if you are struggling to remember names and faces don't worry because each episode focuses on different people and by the time you get to the 6th episode's opening credits you can name every single face. So really it's like a learning experience, and trust me, there is nothing better than to be able to watch the opening sequence and feel connected to each character (and even whistle when your favourites come up). I truly loved Band of Brothers and like I said before I envy those who are still to experience this amazing series. The opening credits for this ten hour mini-series about a company of U.S. WWII paratroopers are a preview of the quality of the series. The credits are a work of art and presage what is to come by using a sequence of desaturated images distilled from the complete series. These images are set to a moving score that announces the unifying musical theme.<br/><br/>Part one begins with the company in training camp in 1942 in Georgia. We feel that we have seen all of this before - the rigors of training, the hard-ass captain, the seemingly irrational discipline, and the personal frictions. But in this segment we get to know most of the guys we will be following - to England, to being dropped behind the lines on D-day, to grueling fighting in France and Belgium, and on to Germany and VE day. The use of muted color in this segment is effective in evoking the feeling of the time. Part one ends with a compelling sequence showing the paratroopers boarding C-47s and the planes taking off one after the other. The use of some original C-47s and computer graphics give you the feeling of being there for this historic event. And, inside the planes, the camera pans the expressions on the faces of the guys and you get some feeling for what being there must have been like. The emphasis here is on "some feeling," since this is obviously one of those cases where you can only try to put yourself in the position of what it would feel like to be getting ready to jump out of a plane into enemy territory at night with a good chance that you won't even make it to the ground alive.<br/><br/>Part two takes up where Part one leaves off with the soldiers on the planes heading to France, each deep in his own personal thoughts. Then, as the planes reach their drop zones, we witness one of the most astounding visual sequences I have ever seen filmed. With anti-aircraft fire going off all around, there are cuts to inside some of the planes, to planes being hit, to troopers jumping into the chaos of explosions and planes crashing and burning. Experiencing the intensity of this scene is about as close as I ever want to get to the real thing and in watching it you probably are getting about a one per cent effect of the real thing.<br/><br/>In subsequent parts we see some heavy-duty ground battles. Never having been in battle I can't speak to the realism of the recounting of these, but it certainly had enough of an appearance of reality that the intensity of a one hour segment was enough for a day. When I saw that the title of Part six was "Bastogne," I knew it was going to be a grizzly and difficult affair and almost felt like skipping it. If I was hesitant to even watch this, what must it have felt like to be there? This battle in the Ardenne forest was so grim that it is hard to believe that anyone made it alive. Being mostly a true story, not all of the men make it through - some die, some are gravely wounded, some are severely scarred mentally. So it is with all wars and, at this time, we are made to think of the soldiers in Iraq.<br/><br/>The acting is uniformly good, with Damain Lewis a standout as Major Winters. Using relatively unknown actors added authenticity since you could identify with them as being the people they were playing rather than actors playing parts. <br/><br/>The production values are top notch. The audio track is intimate - everything from footsteps and whizzing bullets to tank engines and major explosions are right there in the room with you. The men's wounds are rendered with enough realism to turn your stomach and the shelling in the Ardenne was an amazing piece of work. The make-up is outstanding, taking the men from robust health at the beginning to bedraggled exhaustion toward the end.<br/><br/>Each part is introduced by a few minutes of comments by some of the survivors. This added much authenticity and poignancy to the proceedings. One comment that stuck with me was:<br/><br/>"We came from a small small town and three fellas in that town that were 4F committed suicide, because they couldn't go. A different time."<br/><br/>The final scenes that tell what the guys did after the war are some of the most emotionally charged. The real lieutenant Lipton quoted from the speech Henry V gives to his troops before the battle of Agincourt in Shakespeare's "Henry V":<br/><br/>"From this day to the ending of the world, But we in it shall be remembered- we few, we happy few, we band of brothers; For he to-day that sheds his blood with me Shall be my brother"<br/><br/>This gives us the origin of the title for the series.<br/><br/>And not to be overlooked is the history lesson. I had never realized how crucial a role paratroopers played in the Allied victory. And the scenes at the concentration camp are enough to make you physically ill.<br/><br/>In thinking about the level of organization it took to produce this series I could only try to imagine the level of organization it took to organize the real thing.<br/><br/>I was a little bothered by the bending of the truth in implying that the men of Easy Company were the first to reach Obersalzberg at the very end of the war. Any other criticisms I would have would be niggling.<br/><br/>At the end a captured German general is allowed to address his troops which, we are led to believe, is exactly what Winters would have said to his troops; he winds up by saying, "You deserve long and happy lives in peace." Amen. I realize that this movie carries favorable sentiments from real-life combat veterans - and that is a wonderful thing. If you tend to like movies that go for authentic representations of the people, emotions, hardware and events that occurred during World War II, you're in for a treat. Each episode is intro'd by the actual servicemen who lived through the events. Can't can't much better than that.<br/><br/>Yet, if you're not quite into war movies (like myself), this mini-series may not be ideal for you. Over the years, I've seen quite a number of movies about the American men and women who served during WWII, so for me, the genre was pretty well played out.<br/><br/>Could this movie add something extra to re-invigorate interest in this area? I think the answer is 'yes' for some, and 'no' for others. The large cast, enhanced authenticity and sub-plots/stories weren't quite enough to do it for me. Of course, there were times when segments of the show would be captivating, but there weren't enough of them to make this movie (esp. given the length) a win for me.<br/><br/>I can't see myself recommending it to friends who have no interest in war movies, but would give it a thumbs-up for those who do. Lots of people applaud this series for its realism, but I can't really agree. I think there is still too way much Hollywood here and a lot of the scenes are cliché. The Germans are almost without exception behaving as total amateurs. For example, in the Crossroads episode they let themselves be completely surprised by the American attack in the rear, and in response they go running round in the open like a bunch of headless chickens to be shot down in droves. Yet we are told that these are SS soldiers. The SS was a crack unit and I don't believe that they were such poor soldiers to let this happen to them. One of the first things you get taught in tactical school is to secure your perimeter and set guards in all directions.<br/><br/>The American side too made huge blunders, if we accept this to be a realistic depiction of what happened in reality. Take the attack on the village of Foy (another place where we constantly see crowds of Germans nervously running around in the open for no apparent reason). The Americans knew that the Germans had artillery and tanks there, yet they assault the village with less than one Company of infantry without any attempt to soften up the defenders first! What are they thinking? Where was the Air Force? Couldn't they bomb the village first? Where was the American artillery? Couldn't they lay a barrage on the village before the attack? Why not use smoke grenades to give themselves some cover when they crossed the open fields? And we are supposed to feel sorry for the guys that their attack got bogged down? <br/><br/>Also very unrealistic is the layout of the opposing sides in the Last Patrol episode. If you believe this, the lines were less than hundred meters apart, yet on both sides people were walking around right in the open, and exposing themselves at the windows etc. At night they show some huge spotlights on the German side - surely those would be immediate targets given that they only appear to be a couple of hundred meters away from the Americans and plainly visible? Ridiculous! The behaviour of the Americans during the shelling in the Bastogne wood is equally unrealistic. Why are they all walking around in the open and talking to each other if they were so close to the German lines and expecting to come under fire? They should have been sitting in their foxholes, observing the enemy, not walking around chatting as if they were taking a stroll in the park! And then when the first shells explode why are some of them running round like idiots, shouting to the others to take cover? Don't you think that these D-day veterans would know by now to take cover when the shells start flying? All this kind of stuff that is only designed to get us excited and rooting for the characters is typical Hollywood nonsense. Never mind the decent acting, the good costumes and props, the camera-work - if the overall behaviour of the characters is quite unbelievable the entire story falls flat on its face. I am still waiting for the first truly realistic depiction of front-line combat - but I don't think I will ever get to see it, because in reality it isn't very photogenic so it wouldn't sell. Thanks to hbo go... i can watch bob.... for that im eternally thankfull....its the best tv series i ever watch... full of drama, suspense and real emotion...what a joy to watch a masterpiece This is the true story of Easy Company, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division. It start 2 years before D-Day as they train in Camp Toccoa, Georgia. They battle from Normandy ending with the idleness of occupation in Germany.<br/><br/>This is almost perfect television. It takes compelling important history and makes it a thriller touching TV event. There are so many great characters. The greatness of this show is that these actors make these characters come alive. Obviously the audience isn't expected to keep track of every character. However every leading character has a compelling personality. It's also a new level of authenticity for TV production. The action is thrilling. The last episode is slower dealing with an usual aspect of the struggle. The episode is unexpected but compelling nevertheless. This is a great TV war miniseries from start to finish. In a case of over-hype, I was disappointed on first viewing of this extremely well loved 10 part, 10 hour mini-series. I had been told too many times how incredible it was, and so minor faults became glaring problems and disappointments. <br/><br/>Returning to it over 10 years later the positives seem much stronger. By following a platoon from basic training to the end of WW II the series allows for a truly epic sweep. And the characters, while occasionally falling into cliché are generally extremely well acted, and evolve in believable, complex and sometimes terrifically unpredictable ways. <br/><br/>The series is at its best when it feels the most real, putting the audience into the horrors of battle in ways that don't glorify war, death and destruction, even if saluting the bravery and humanity of this small group of men. This is war as brutal, nasty, sudden and arbitrary. Who lives and who dies sometimes has as much to do with dumb luck as bravery or skill. Fear and exhaustion are constant companions. For every good leader who takes care of his men there's a weak one who gets people killed. <br/><br/>The device of having the real members of the actual company, now very old, start each episode sharing their memories is a great choice, reminding us that this is no fictional story, but the true tale of very young men doing the best they could in nightmarish circumstances that would humble anyone. When the show first aired some critics were bothered by the fact that it was hard to tell the men apart, and I must admit I had that problem too. But this time around it was far easier. Whether it's just familiarity, or (as I suspect) the advantages of a far bigger, better TV, and high-definition images, suddenly there was much more visual ease in knowing who was who, which made the episodes not only easier to follow, but far more emotional. <br/><br/>Not every episode is as strong. Some are truly devastating or deeply enthralling. Others can feel a bit less urgent, a bit unfocused. But even the least are interesting, and have powerful moments. As the two men at the center of it all Damien Lewis and Ron Livingston give excellent, fleshed out performances. But if they seem more focused than some of the other characters that probably has to do with total screen time, and the fact we keep returning to them, then any defects on the part of the others. Overall this is a stirring, human, emotional history lesson and a fitting tribute to those who gave everything they had in 'the good war'. Being a British subject, I am rather predisposed to being rather cynical when it comes to Hollywood's tales of World War 2 (my grandpa always told me it was rather different).<br/><br/>Perhaps it is the BBC investment in the production, perhaps it is the British actors involved, or more probably it is a product of thoughtful and detailed investigation, but this series cuts through the usual glitzy nostalgia and pretty much tells you as it is.<br/><br/>The lack of a single character in the story, means that the bigger picture is the real star, and the series is all the better for it.<br/><br/>Humour, action and history, well worth a watch. Incredible series, the acting, the special effects, the direction and the stories from the veterans prefacing each episode touched me. I can't imagine being a young man of eighteen or nineteen and subjected to those kinds of situations. I found myself horrified in parts, wondering 'how did they cope?'  Damian Lewis did an outstanding job portraying Captain Winters. David Schwimmer pleasantly surprised me. Normally it's hard to see a typecast actor anything else than the character he played for years. But much to my surprise, he played a great 'prick', an instructor you learned to hate.  Excellent performances by Matthew Settle, Ron Livingston and Donnie Wahlberg....the whole cast. Good thus far, but I thought that the 60s' t.v series "Combat" did a better job of character development.  Additionally, I feel as though "Combat" conveyed the horrors of war to the viewer without having to use the gory special effects as those displayed in this mini-series. Still, a good story with good acting I was just a lad during WWII, but as the son of a military officer I heard a lot of cussing, all of which would sound downright quaint today.<br/><br/>Therefore, my ability to "suspend belief" was pretty much destroyed by the modern sound of the actor's dialog in this series, particularly when using so called "foul language." They sounded like modern soldiers to me, and this is not the only time DreamWorks has failed in this regard. "Saving Private Ryan" suffered from this--as well as some other--anachronism(s). <br/><br/>The cost of movie production could easily include a couple hundred dollars for someone a bit older than Spielberg to take a quick look, so I'll classify this shortcoming as an amazing, disappointing, and unnecessary failure by the writers and the studio. ......I am somewhat 'Private Ryaned'-out, what w/ the overkill of shaky-cam and washed-out cinematography running rampant thruout Hollywood since '98, so bear w/ me on that. <br/><br/>This series has all the attributes you wanna see in a good WWII production: real-life stories, believable characters, good production values, nothing outta place. All of this I liked, saw and admired.<br/><br/>What isn't so great-well you have a guy from 'Friends' in there, and then you have "New Kid on Block Donny" as a lead. Both are good, certainly-but it did take me outta the narrative a couple times. Other actors while gritty and etc are interchangeable, it was hard to keep track of who was doing what to who ala 'Black Hawk Down' in spots. This of course is how it works in real life, but if you are watching a movie, it doesn't make it easier.<br/><br/>I thought the episodes were bogging down towards the end too, 'Battle of the Bulge' certainly a high point along the way.<br/><br/>Nothing really to say otherwise bad about this production, I recc. it to anyone who wants to get a realistic look-see at what our grandparents did and faced 60 years ago.<br/><br/>***1/2 outta ****. I was watching this series and thought it was good. There was so much talk it was so realistic and based on true stories. Then there was the episode about the Netherlands and seeing the "hills(!) of Eindhoven" just made me laugh. The boy who brought olives to the soldiers was just ridiculous, as were the peasants traveling in a Russian carriage. Then my parents and mother-in-law (who lived through all this) pointed out all the other stupid mistakes they made. They found it offensive and couldn't watch for more then 10 minutes. With all the money they put in this series they could have put some towards research in authenticity. Maybe for the USA this war has become just a story but in Europe it is living memory. This is the only recent TV series that I've watched apart from ROME (2005) and, though similarly proficient and pain-staking, it doesn't really say anything that couldn't be just as effectively presented in a standard feature film; actually, the series was inspired by the success of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (1998) - and, in fact, the star and director of that award-winning epic (Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg respectively) serve as Executive Producers here, and Hanks even directed one of the episodes himself (albeit amounting to possibly the least interesting of all!).<br/><br/>Based on the real-life WWII exploits of the so-called Easy Company - with most episodes introduced by the reminiscences of surviving members a' la REDS (1981) - the rambling script has several of the soldiers take turns narrating their participation in key events during the war (D-Day, Arnhem, Bastogne, VE-Day , etc.) in the style of THE THIN RED LINE (1998): this means that the film basically alternates between a celebration of camaraderie and a gruesome display of carnage, while at the same time showcasing an adequate young cast. While the depiction of the front-line is certainly among the most harrowing and realistic ever put on film, the narrative is hampered by having so many anonymous characters that one has trouble distinguishing them from one another.<br/><br/>Quality varies from one episode to the other but I found the latter stages to be the best, with the sections devoted to the Battle of the Bulge, the discovery of concentration camps in Germany and the needless extended stay in Europe after the capitulation of the Nazis emerging as the most compelling - and moving. It came highly recommended and I must say I was sceptical ... another example of the US routing the Nazi scourge singlehandedly, according to a Hollywood script, I feared. Generally, I don't watch war films but recently watched another and this was touted as its modern equivalent and a companion episode, if you like.<br/><br/>So I thought, OK, no, this really happened, it's a legitimate telling of a genuine story and I'll give it a go and see if it's better than the usual WWII dross that is served up by too many Hollywood (or Pinewood) scriptwriters.<br/><br/>And what a fabulous, realistic production it is. Apart from the oafish portrayal of the cockney soldier dressed up as a German (no-one really speaks like that! It was cringe-worthy), it started out nicely: the first three episodes were great, until I got to the inevitable Brit-bashing in episode four (Sigh, when will we all learn? I mean, really, what else did I expect from an American-funded and produced series, even with British actors and BBC input?).<br/><br/>I know a little bit about this as I have a much-loved uncle (since passed away), a member of the British 1st Airborne who was very badly wounded at Arnhem after six days of house-to-house fighting with the SS and one of the few who survived the encounter - a real paratrooper, not a celluloid one, and a genuine tough-as-teak gentle giant of a war hero who won a real medal for his trouble, hated war, and rarely spoke about it.<br/><br/>So the portrayal of the idiotic British tank commander and the subsequent retreat (it didn't happen, incidentally) really rankles, and besmirches the treasured memory of people like my uncle Tom who, like the rest of my family, never had a bad word for Americans. I am sure there are many families in Britain and elsewhere in the English-speaking world who feel the same way.<br/><br/>I should point out that being an Australian, I am no great lover of the English, either, but loving to hate them is different to actually hating them and is more like a national sport for us ... and it's very different to this kind of thing, which often comes across as taking every opportunity to stereotype and denigrate them.<br/><br/>Perhaps producers of these kinds of shows, if they care, and I suspect they probably don't, might take a moment to reflect on what I've written here and realise that there is an economic cost to it as well: word gets around, and when you ostracise a large proportion of your potential English-speaking primary audience, you are sending a lot of dough down the toilet.<br/><br/>In this changing world, too, it's probably good for Americans to realise that the Brits are among the few real friends they have. So you've lost me, once again, with this nonsense and I won't be wasting any more time and money watching the rest of the episodes, which is sad considering the quality of the production - and it's a view shared by plenty of others I know.<br/><br/>Over-sensitive? No, just sick and tired of it. Next time I'll stick to a different movie genre that I know is pure entertainment, not slickly produced jingoistic nonsense with some basis in reality that is wrongly dressed up as fact. When reading the User Comments on Band of Brothers it is very hard to find a bad word said about it. I saw the Box set on sale but wanted to hear other people's opinions about it first and when I read the user comments I thought ' How can I go wrong'?<br/><br/>Well I bought it and was very impressed by the first episode. What was even more impressing was much I hated David Schwimmer as Captain Herbert Sobel I thought there was no way in a million years could I be convinced to hate somebody who plays the lovable Ross in Friends but how wrong was I and how amazing it was to see him in a role so completely different and so good. But after the first episode I think it went downhill. Parts were good and others just dragged on and there was no finishing to it. <br/><br/>What I didn't like was I was told how much you care for these guys throughout the whole ten parts series but I couldn't find a way to let them in and sympathies for them. There are some great actors here but have obvious scripts and seems like a ten hour Saving Private Ryan which it is. I wasn't taken into these men's lives and didn't believe the horror's of war which happened amongst them all.<br/><br/>There are some nice bittersweet moments and it is stunning to look at and has a powerful music score and great set of actors but is very disappointing as far as story and direction goes. Not even the likes of Spielberg can save this, but I am probably missing something as everybody else seems to have fallen in love with Band of Brothers but I think what went wrong was that I heard so much good about it I was expecting to much. I wasn't impressed by Saving Private Ryan but I thought I would have loved BOB but it didn't do anything for me at all.<br/><br/>One last thing, Band of Brothers Normandy invasion of Normandy from the sky is nearly just as good as the beach scene in Private Ryan and is well worth a look at. "Band of Brothers" is a nearly 12 hour long show about the experiences of a group of soldiers during their tour of duty in Europe during WWII. Given that it is this long, it allows so much more in the way of character development and story telling than a typical war movie. The closest thing to this quality-wise is the original version of "Das Boot"--as it was a mini-series and was later spliced apart to make it a motion picture. But even then, the German submarine film was only about 40% as long and never got into the detail and had quite the emotional impact as "Band of Brothers". In every way, the show screams quality--with amazing sets, details and direction. In fact, while the budget for this was large ($125,000,000 according to IMDb), it was actually pretty small considering the number of actors, the amazing sets and the length of the series. This is a must-see for anyone and I would say more and heap more praise on the film except that there are already hundreds and hundreds of other reviews on IMDb that pretty much do that already. in band of brothers war is viewed quite realistically, in my opinion, and more importantly from all angles, not trying to make any side more evil or more heroic than it was, just showing what did happen. showing the real veterans interviewed is a great plus bringing credibility to the series. acting, directing and editing are all good. i'd like to see more quality series like this with good crew and actors.<br/><br/>the biggest minus in my book was the character developement, or the lack of it. there were too many characters, bringing these replacement men in all the time. only character that was really well developed was nix. i didn't like the cheesy theme music either, but that's irrelevant.<br/><br/>a great piece of tv no matter what. I was well aware of BoB but had not watched it when first came on TV. Knowing that I something of a war history buff, my daughter bought me the mini series on DVD so I have just given it a viewing. I got as far as Episode 4 before consigning to my 'don't watch again' collection.<br/><br/>It starts off promisingly enough, even if Sobel is something of a caricature, but then it descends into yet another piece of false jingoism. To list all of the errors and omissions and rip-offs would take several A4 pages.<br/><br/>We see the US airborne being briefed on their support for Omah and Utah Beaches. No one says 'whats happening at Gold, Sword or Juno?. There was some flak during the 101st airborne drop on D-Day, but it was not that intensive yet we see flak going up as if it was a raid on Berlin. The main German resistance was at St Marie Eglise which was in fact captured by the US 82nd airborne. The 101st were scattered everywhere because the inexperienced US pilots panicked and dropped their cargo all over the place rendering them largely ineffective until they eventually managed to regroup in the vicinity of SME.<br/><br/>But for me the complete tosh surrounding Operation Market Garden as what killed this for me, especially as my father was part of British XXX Corp.He had previously been through North Africa and the Sword landings, and the Battle of Caen. The 101st landings at Eindhoven were very simple and they took the bridge with almost no opposition.Here is a quotation from Steven Badsey's excellent "Operation Market Garden".<br/><br/>In the south, the 101st met little resistance and captured four of five bridges assigned to them. After a brief delay caused by an 88 mm gun and a machine gun post, the bridge at Son was blown up as they approached it. Later that day several small attacks by the German 59th Infantry Division were beaten off. Small units of the 101st moved south of Son, towards Eindhoven. Later that day it contacted, and was given as attachment the 44th Royal Tank Regiment elements of which were advancing in the VIII Corps sector.<br/><br/>The 101st did not liberate Eindhoven and did not have any contact with British XXX Corp until General Taylor handed over control. British XXX Corp liberated Eindhoven. The 101st did not go anywhere near the town.<br/><br/>The real drama happened at Arnhem where by mischance the British paras jumped right into a major elite SS Panzer regiment who had been just sent there for R&R and were basically wiped out. Part of this elite group was sent to Nijmegan, target for the 82nd airborne who ran into very fierce resistance but held the German offensive until XXX Corp arrived and overran them. This was the real US involvmemt in OMG. Eindhoven was a small side-show.<br/><br/>There were small things that irritated me. We see a Dutchman and his son provide information in Eindhoven to the 101st. This is a direct rip off of part of the story in the 1977 movie 'A Bridge to Far'and is set in Arnhem. It may or not be true but either way it seems totally unnecessary to rip off something like this which patently did not happen.<br/><br/>Anyway, I have said my piece. I just don't see why the Americans can't just stick to the facts. The story would be just as noble and thought provoking without telling blatant mistruths.<br/><br/>5/10 for the grittiness, good action sequences. Pity about everything else. What a telling of a story. Only complaint is that I think the story could have been told with the same impact without focusing on the horrific violence of war as long. After skipping over a few things in this series, I found it a worthwhile glimpse into history. The series is wonderful. It has been known to imitate the true reality in a great way. The use of the soundtrack is acceptable. There are certain camera errors.
I have sincerely made the series very short.
Acceptable effects I won't go for the story, u can read it above. All what I wanna say is that this is a master piece and is worth watching from every possible aspects. Malarkey , Winters these characters were sketched so realistic that u feel at every step as if u r too, a member of 101st and is practically participating in all their missions, and thus withstanding all the pain & agony as being their comrade. <br/><br/>I'm not a judge in historical accuracy, neither of that contemporary, but this very Mini-Series successively dragged me to the 40's witness all the live actions.<br/><br/>So, I highly recommend all U war movie lovers or haters to watch this one, which may change your course of likes & taste for future. I didn't get to watch Band of Brothers when it first aired on television due to missing it, and not really getting into it due to commitments. Finally only recently did I get the chance through buying the complete HBO drama on DVD, and I was pleased that the price I paid was well worth it. Personally I only like some World War 2 films, and haven't really found an engrossing TV series that pulls me in. I wanted factual drama, that was real and obviously a true story. I got this with Band of Brothers.<br/><br/>Through the first two episodes we get to know the characters as they develop through training before being sent to fight in Europe, and begin to Norway campaign of the war. Soon afterwards, we are thrown into the dark, chaotic action of the show. I can say it is some of the most realistic war scenes and battles i've ever seen, especially since this is by Steven Spielberg who also did Saving Private Ryan. Its gritty, its dirty, its muddy, its horrible and its true to life.<br/><br/>From the beginning of episode 3 onto episodes 6 and 7 we see some of the more smaller skirmishes US forces faced as they pushed their way across France towards Nazi held Germany. Along the way, the characters of the show and soldiers of the 101st Airbourne Division fight in Holland, Belgium and finally the Rhine. These smaller more unknown campaigns and skirmishes along the way through the European theatre of war, really give us insight into the characters. From D-Day landings to the Battle of the Bulge, from the smaller campaigns of the war in Holland and Belgium to finally capturing Hitler's Eagle's Nest. How they've progressed and really changed through their traumatic experiences and Spielberg shows them very well as he did in Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/>Finally the last three episodes bring together the final moments of the war in Europe, for the 101st Airbourne. As many prepare to return home to the US, to their sweethearts and to leave the service, while others are not so fortunate as they prepare to leave to fight the remainder of the war in the Pacific. Along this journey, the show we watch many favourite characters die, become injured and leave, and others we wish would just be able to go home.<br/><br/>Band of Brothers does not feel like a mini-series, even the episodes I do not regard as simple episodes. They feel like chapters in a flowing story, each part has a different story to tell in a different scenario and situation of the war. All sets, battles, equipment and weapons are all realistically portrayed and do not feel cheap. I could recommend Band of Brothers to fans of World War 2 dramas, or even fans of Saving Private Ryan but Band of Brothers is far more than just a war drama. Its a solid piece of historical history relived in television, of an uncertain and dangerous period of our history.<br/><br/>If Band of Brothers is anything to go by, I can only imagine the Pacific is just as good and will be buying it on DVD to watch also and add to Band of Brothers. Personally, I can't get my head wrapped around the idea that some people out there think this series is awful. Wondering why the Americans were portrayed as victors? BECAUSE THEY WERE, THANK GOD! I happen to have met many, many 101st Airborne veterans, some of them now famous thanks to BoB. My opinion of these men (they are not just characters, they're people!) couldn't possibly be higher and if they say it's a great series, then that's all the verification I need. Sure, like all shows, it has its flaws, but they can be easily overlooked.It's got nothing to do with nationalism. It's history and none of us can re-write it. The allied soldiers won. Sorry if you don't agree, but it is what it is. And of all movies, series and documentaries I've seen, this is one of the best. Thanks Dick Winters, Thanks Easy Company, thanks Screaming Eagles then and now!<br/><br/>Dedicated to my no. 1 Veteran... This is, without a doubt, one of the best series that I have ever seen, and for so many reasons. Cinematographic-ally, the series is renowned for its accuracy in recreating the atmosphere of a true WW2 battlefield, and due to this, the effect on screen is absolutely staggering at times. Fast paced gun fights, heavy mortar fire and beautiful scenery all feature and combine to create an incredible visual experience. It really does appear that no expense was spared (and judging by the $120,000,000 spent on it, it seems unlikely that any was). The plot is gripping, entertaining and harrowing at times, and the fact that it is true makes it all the more powerful. However, I found that the strongest thing about the series for me was the characters. Whilst initially proving difficult to keep up with and follow, as the series develops, the audience get to know the individual characters and how they fitted into the 506th, both in rank and in personality. The acting is phenomenal; not for a moment did I ever doubt a performance. <br/><br/>If you haven't seen Band of Brothers, I recommend it highly - and not just to those who like war films, because it is so much more than that. Its all too easy to forget or to underestimate what our forebears went through twice in the last century. I truly believe that both Band of Brothers and Saving Private Ryan should be part of the curriculum in schools so that our kids get just a small part of the meaning of the word sacrifice. My generation, in the UK at least, is the first ever that has been spared the horrors of mass warfare. We should regard it as our mission to keep the memory of what our parents went through fresh in the world's minds. Then there is a chance that we may prevent it ever happening again. Band of Brothers is quite simply the ultimate in approaching WW2 reality. The fact that it is also, equally simply, the finest ensemble piece ever created for a screen of any size is just a bonus. I wish I could score it with eleven out of ten. I have seen many war movies in my life mostly the good ones including Saving Private Ryan, Platoon, Schindler's List, The Thin Red Line and many but I just can't think of anything better than this. What a Story!!!! What a company !!! I don't know these men personally, neither was I born at that time to serve with them nor was there to share their pain, grief, relief and everything they went through but I feel honoured to even watch this Series. Thanks to Spielberg and Tom Hanks, I feel really proud that we live in peace because of them. It is an honour to know these men what they did, not only for their country but for the world. They laid their lives, lived in those Snowy Foxholes facing death every moment and still fought on to gift us(their next generation) a much better place to live in. Thanks a lot...<br/><br/>I SALUTE EVERY MAN IN THE EASY COMPANY!!!!! Wordless. Genius. I'm not able to tell my opinion in words. I'm enthusiastic about this Series. Realistic - and.. dismayed... One of the really, really things every one must have seen.<br/><br/>The Characters, the war himself... unbelievable... The Best World War Movie/Series I've ever seen... Saving Private Ryan tells a good, violent story... but this Series is tell you much more about the soldiers of the second world war...<br/><br/>See it & ossify in front of it...<br/><br/>They are showing more than shooting "Krauts". They show the feelings and the horror of War!<br/><br/>Watch it and make your own opinion! The miniseries is based on Stephen E. Ambrose's highly acclaimed book of the same name and is produced by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, who also notably made the award-winning film, 'Saving Private Ryan'. The series is made up of 10 one-hour episodes, each with a different director (one of which is Tom Hanks). <br/><br/>'Band of Brothers' is the HBO miniseries which follows the men of Easy Company of the US Army Airbourne Paratrooper division. These soldiers were beyond elite; volunteering to be the best of the best and to do what had never been done before; parachute behind enemy lines. The full enormity of this task may be somewhat lost on today's generation; it's impossible to comprehend just how courageous these men must have been to willingly jump out of a moving airplane, only to find themselves deep in enemy territory... none of which had ever been done before WWII. The men of Easy Company have become particularly celebrated war heroes because their achievements during WWII were truly extraordinary, as 'Band of Brothers' illustrates. The series begins with the 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne's severe training in 1942 at Camp Toccoa, Georgia and follows them through their disastrous drop on D-Day into France, Market Garden, the Battle of the Bulge and the capturing of Hitler's Eagle's nest in 1945. Even more extraordinary is that Easy Company accomplished all of this as a unit which took 150% casualties throughout the war. <br/><br/>This miniseries is like a much more personalized and impressive extension of 'Saving Private Ryan'; it aligns the audience with one regiment, Easy Company, and follows them through hardships, losses and triumphs. We come to understand the odd camaraderie between the men, and laugh along with their macabre sense of humor. Each episode, while exploring and emphasizing the friendship between the men of Easy Company; also creates personal stories of particular men. Episode 3 'Carentan' aligns the audience with one particular troop, Pvt Blithe (Marc Warren) still coming to terms with his role in the war. Episode 6 'Bastogne' follows Doc Eugene Roe (Shane Taylor) and explores the very separate hardships the medics experience. Episode 7 'The breaking point' is narrated by Sergent Lipton (Donnie Wahlberg) as he nonchalantly explains his intricate duty to keep up morale. Episode 8 'The Last Patrol' puts us in the mind-set of Private Webster (Eion Bailey) as he returns from a 4 month injury absence and, like a replacement, now feels an outsider amongst his unit. And throughout the miniseries many insights are narrated by the sometime protagonist, Major Winters (Damian Lewis) as he makes the transition from Easy Company's gifted CO to being promoted to major and sadly having to distance himself somewhat from his close-knit company. There is not a continuous viewpoint sustained throughout the series, allowing a sweeping understanding of all facets of the war within one company and through many eyes. <br/><br/>The actors, though cast primarily for their resemblance to the real men of easy company, are all superb in their roles. These actors went through a grueling boot camp experience before shooting to really authenticate their roles; and all are more than accomplished actors. At the beginning of each episode is a small snippet of an interview with the real men of the 101st Airborne, as a sort of introduction to the episode; these interviews are sometimes heartbreaking, other times very informative and always interesting, adding to the documentary air of the miniseries which also acts to remind just how cemented in fact this story is. We do not learn the names of these veterans until the very last episode (obviously to heighten the drama element, not knowing which men survived and who perished); once you know which men the actors were portraying, you can have a real admiration for their task. Frank John Hughes, for instance, had Bill Guarnere's southern drawl accent perfectly down pat. Damian Lewis must also be commended for an amazing American accent, with no hint whatsoever of his British roots. <br/><br/>The sets on 'Band of Brothers' are truly magnificent. To really appreciate the craftsmanship and very 'old Hollywood' style of movie making, the documentary included on the DVD should be watched; honestly, it will astound and amaze. One 12 acre set was used in England, and was continuously transformed to look like 11 different European cities and towns. The snow-covered woods of Bastogne were actually a hand-made set. And, to further understand and praise this miniseries; by the third episode of shooting, the special effects department had used more pyrotechnics than were used in the entire production of 'Saving Private Ryan'. <br/><br/>There simply aren't enough words of praise for this HBO miniseries which, among many other awards and nominations, won the Emmy for 'Outstanding Miniseries', 'Outstanding Casting for a Miniseries' and 'Outstanding Directing for a Miniseries'. 'Band of Brothers' is guaranteed to impress; you don't have to be a war-nut to enjoy it, the emotional and dramatic elements are more than enough to sustain interest, but the enormity of the production and realness will truly inspire and amaze. This is an absolute must-see for any and everybody and will surely forever be the quintessential war story. Even though the movie is  six hours long i could not get away from the screen, the actors are fabulous especially  Neil McDonough as 1St Lt Lynn "Buck" Compton who made his best performance yet. the movie itself had a excellent plot but at the same time   had  lots of action, which would always wanting you to see more. this movie surpasses  Saving Private Ryan, and  I am buying the dvd as soon as I can. So i over emphisize  that you rent this movie as it it available at most leading movie stores. I loved the movie and judging by the 9 point something average score ppl gave BoB, others loved it too. I don't know how people could've made something as terrible as war, such a wonderful thing as the series but I highly commend the people who were apart of the series. Also to those who were apart of the real deal. The actors were amazing (especially Damian Lewis), the writers even better and the overall effect was absolutely fantastic.<br/><br/>So away from my whole commenting jazz.. can anyone tell me if BoB is like for sale on video or something? There have been so many superlatives hurled at this series (and a few misguided or uninformed detracting remarks) that it's probably pointless to state the obvious once again, but two days after viewing the final episode and thinking about little else but BoB since then, I feel compelled to say that it is one of the most powerful pieces of television I have ever seen.<br/><br/>It is not simply a poor relation of Private Ryan: Brothers, without belittling the achievement of that movie, expands on and enhances the WWII experience as seen from the eyes of the ordinary foot soldier. Rooted firmly in fact, the series, with it's incredible writing and directing, not to mention the spectacular production values, takes on a life of it's own once the final images fade away. By the end, you are left wondering more about these men, how they adapted to civilian life, how, after sharing the camaraderie in conflict that they did, were they able to go home and continue their lives and return to some sense of normality under the shadow of everything they had witnessed and done. There is no cosy conclusion to BoB as such, no sense of total completion (and some have been annoyed by this), but I feel that this is the proper way to end the story. Sure, you want to know more, but the fact that you are grateful for men like Winters, Nixon, Lipton, Roe, Randlemann et al, and comforted that someone like that can go through hell for everything you take for granted, only adds to the undiluted realism that Brothers strived for and achieved so stunningly.<br/><br/>As for the acting: Damian Lewis, Ron Livingston, Donnie Wahlberg and so on deserve all the kudos that have been bestowed upon them, but for me there is a trio of actors who have not been mentioned nearly enough and deserve a substantial share of the plaudits.<br/><br/>Shane Taylor as Doc Eugene Roe can muster a response or emotion from the viewer with just a glance: the pain and anxiety of his character, as well as his determination and his sympathy for his fellows was illustrated beautifully by this incredible actor who does not need dialogue to stamp his authority on a scene.<br/><br/>Michael Cudlitz as Sgt "Bull" Randlemann was just as incredible, making the<br/><br/>most of the episode that focussed on his character's plight behind enemy lines (Replacements) and exuding the firm and steady nature that instilled the confidence which those in his charge must have shared. "Bull", in lesser hands, could have descended into a sheer war movie stereotype (the big, cigar chomping sergeant), but Cudlitz's quiet but authoritative presence throughout all 10 episodes marks him as an actor to watch.<br/><br/>Dexter Fletcher as Sgt John Martin provided another rock for the other characters to play off. I've been aware of Fletcher as an actor since Bugsy Malone, through Press Gang, The Rachel Papers and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, but here more than anywhere else before does he demonstrate his versatility and effortless ability and propels himself into the ranks of Britain's finest actors.<br/><br/>Singling these three out is not meant to diminish the other performances in any way as the acting throughout was faultless (and I normally hate David Schwimmer!). Indeed, if this is an indication of the wealth of new and upcoming talent out there as an antidote to the Freddie Prinze's of the world, it instills nothing but hope.<br/><br/>Finally, in a year that produced the frankly risible and obnoxious Pearl Harbor (a comic strip bastardisation of history made for morons), it is good to know that the likes of HBO, Dreamworks and Playtone are prepared to take risks, present the horror and humanity of war in the most unflinching way, and produce something both passionate and intelligent. It is equally heartening to know that there is a sizeable audience for such fare. There may be other war movies and shows to come, but they would need to be very special indeed to match the achievement of Band of Brothers. It is, in short, an unqualified masterpiece.<br/><br/>10 / 10 In just about all aspects, Band of Brothers is a tremendous<br/><br/>achievement. The series, based on actual events, follows the<br/><br/>World War Two exploits of the men of Easy Company, 506th<br/><br/>Regiment, 101st Airborne Division, from their initial training in the<br/><br/>United States to the famous D-Day invasion of Europe through the<br/><br/>hardships of the Battle of the Bulge all the way to the capture of<br/><br/>Hitler's Eagle's Nest and the end of the war. The two first episodes<br/><br/>("Currahee" and "Day of Days") were the best. The air attack<br/><br/>sequence in episode two is on par with the opening D-Day<br/><br/>sequence of "Saving Private Ryan." Episode seven ("The Breaking<br/><br/>Point") also stands out in the series. One of the advantages of the<br/><br/>ten episode format is that, unlike a single movie, the viewer can<br/><br/>better see how the battles and hardships wore on these men,<br/><br/>something the actors did a great job of portraying. Damien Lewis,<br/><br/>Ron Livingston, and Donnie Wahlberg stand out among the solid,<br/><br/>albeit relatively anonymous, group of actors. Lewis in particular<br/><br/>does an outstanding turn as Major Richard Winters, the series'<br/><br/>moral and dramatic center. Matthew Settle also does a good job<br/><br/>as Captain Speirs, a prime example that not every American<br/><br/>fighting man was an angel.<br/><br/>In general, the series has the hallmarks of a Spielberg project,<br/><br/>particularly in its superior technical craftsmanship. Some aspects<br/><br/>of the series feel emotionally forced. Certain parts of episodes<br/><br/>(such as Sergeant "Bull" Randleman's adventures behind enemy<br/><br/>lines in episode four, "Replacements") almost descend into<br/><br/>movie-of-the-week melodrama. Also, the series' music seems to<br/><br/>be meant to seek (some might say demand) a constant state of<br/><br/>reverence for what is going on. Nevertheless, this is an excellent<br/><br/>series. I would not compare Band of Brothers to war films like<br/><br/>Platoon or Apocalypse Now; It is closer to the 1960s TV series<br/><br/>"Combat!" in terms of its structure and quality, which is very high.<br/><br/>Band of Brothers is definitely one of the better works to appear on<br/><br/>television or in theaters in the last few years.<br/><br/>Note: For a perfect continuation of the theme, rent "The Best Years<br/><br/>of Our Lives," a great film about GI's coming back home. I had seen bits and pieces of "Band of Brothers" on TV while traveling, and decided to watch the whole thing via Netflix. After watching the first two episodes, "Currahee" and "Day of Days," I was just in awe of this whole thing and rushed that disk back so I could get the next one ASAP (the series is spread out over six disks, and I'm on the three-at-a-time plan). It was bedtime, so I didn't watch the next disk right away; and as I cooled down in the meantime, it occurred to me that I thrilled to watch the planes take off in "Day of Days," but for no reason. The phrase "Fortress Europe" is used once by an Easy Company member on the train up to New York, but that's all. We're just supposed to know the background, I guess. Why, then, was the take-off so moving?<br/><br/>On thinking over the reason for that, I realized it was meant to give me a thrill, quite apart from the actual context. Once that sunk in, the suspension of disbelief disappeared and it was possible to analyze what I had just seen in a rational way. Some visual references of what they were actually up against--something like old footage of Rommel inspecting the German defenses overlooking the channel--would have helped, but all we got were some long-distance views of a single German battery during the admittedly stirring American attack on it, as well as an atrocity against German POWs--which I find very hard to believe, considering that it was Italians who killed the perpetrator's brother; and also given that it occurs along a roadside at a meeting point where Allied soldiers are present in large numbers, and even at My Lai, where there were far fewer American soldiers, there were some who objected to and reported the slaughter--and something arty with dead black horses to convey the image of death on the battlefield without the ugly realities that would lessen the fun and start the viewer thinking.<br/><br/>As for characterization, Sobel is the only character who is drawn with any depth (and David Schwimmer does a superb job!). Everybody else, even Winters, is basically a cartoon: an excellent cartoon, granted, but still, not a thoroughly drawn character, which is one of the basic requirements for drama, even in ensemble performances.<br/><br/>It's intended to be a roller-coaster ride for the eyes and ears and emotions, without much input from the brain required. I was expecting something else. D-Day and the invasion of Normandy and breaking of the German stranglehold on Europe were very much about people versus the machine. On a different subject, I might have enjoyed "Band of Brothers" very much, but not for this one. Never before has such a thing hit the small screen before. This mini-series that got developed and produced by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks is not just only great looking, authentic looking, compelling, spectacular and dramatic, it also got made with all of the right intentions.<br/><br/>They did not just made a WW II mini-series but also a great homage to those who fought during WW II. They did this by brining in some of the real Easy Compagnie veterans, who were still alive at the time. The 10 episodes also feature these veterans often at the beginning and/or end of an episode, reciting some of their memories about the war. We don't know who these veterans that are talking are, not until the very last episode because else you of course already know who survived until the end, which should had taken away some of the series its compelling dramatic and involving elements.<br/><br/>Fore you often feel that you are really a part of these band of brothers as you're watching it. The series puts you right in the middle of all the action and you really feel connected to some of the boys fighting. It makes "Band of Brothers" one of the most compelling experience to ever hit the small screen.<br/><br/>It's an 10 part mini-series, that got directed by 8 different directors and the running time of each episode differs as well. This has as a result that each episode also has a different feel and the story takes a different approach. Often an episode would follow a different character, though the main characters of course at all time remain the same ones. They had to endure a lot of heavy stuff during the war and got deployed at the front or even behind enemy lines in several different European countries. Once you start thinking about it, it seems pretty amazing that some of the guys really went through all of this and made it out alive. Basically everyone got injured once or more at some point, which should give you an impression of the stuff they went through.<br/><br/>Many of the actors who appeared in this mini-series were still relatively unexperienced and unknown. Some of them were obviously cast because they had a real resemblance to the real life soldiers but all of them are great actors in this as well. Some of them have also broken through such as Damian Lewis, Ron Livingston, Donnie Wahlberg, Dexter Fletcher, Neal McDonough and Scott Grimes.<br/><br/>Of course the series has some great but also some somewhat lesser episodes. Some of the episodes do really stand out, such as the ones set in Bastonge but even the somewhat lesser episodes are always compelling to watch. Even when not a lot of fighting is going on the series always manages to suck you right in. This is also because of the series its very authentic look and feel. It was a real expensive production for something that got made for TV and it got made in the same sort of war style as "Saving Private Ryan", which also had Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks involved. It's still a bit weird though seeing how England, Belgium, Holland and France all look the same within this series, which is because it all got shot at the same sets.<br/><br/>I'm also so glad that composer Michael Kamen delivered his best work with this mini-series. He always was a sort of composer who was sort of misunderstood and misused, which never gave him the full credits that he deserved in his life but with this mini-series he showed his true talents and received all the praise for it as well, 2 years before his death, at the age of 55. <br/><br/>This truly is a mini-series that is so incredibly compelling, often shocking, authentic and also really a dramatic experience to watch. The old veteran quoting from a letter at the end of episode 10 gets to me every time and pretty much also sums up as well what this series but also the real life war experience of the second world war was all about for all these young men, so far from home. <br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "Who shall we put on sentry duty herr leutenant?" "Who do we have that has poor eyesight?" "Fritz Schmidt, my leader!" "Put him on sentry duty because the Screaming Eagles Amerikaner paratroopers are sneaking up on us" "Jawohl" This just about sums up this flagwaver. I wound up feeling sorry for the krauts. This sad series is in the John Wayne tradition of impossible feats of arms by Americans. I suppose if it makes the average Yank feel good, it has some therapeutic value for the nation. (Bet George dubya bought the DVD) Still holds up as one of the best tv series/mini films, ever made for me this. BOB is easily the best series depicting D-day, Normandie freeing assault of the allies and their subsequent march across France to the ultimate victory.<br/><br/>It is bold, realistic, complemented with stellar performances, top-notch script and awesome sound and music.<br/><br/>Every actor, being from the allies or the axis forces, gives his best to make this an all-time pearl in the TV series.<br/><br/>Words do not give it justice nor are they enough to create the feel and awe surrounding the show.<br/><br/>Watch it, immerse yourself in the atmosphere and go back to D-day alongside the liberating forces of France. Superb.what an effort by none other than spielberg and hanks.an excellent and realistic picture of the triumphs and the horrors of wars. it shows us what a soldier goes through and the effects it has on society and the human race.excellent cast and acting.highly,highly recommended. a truly modern masterpiece. This was really enjoyable learning about what happened in WW2. The emotions and feelings were greatly portrayed in the show. I watch it every year. Together with The Pacific. It's the first war series that make me fall in love with this category. <br/><br/>The best ever. Band of Brothers is considered by many the best series already done, including in the IMDb has a note of 9,5, for who likes of Saving private Ryan will probably like this series, since it has Tom Hanks and Steve Spielberg involved, the battle is very good, with a production of great quality, great direction, and great performances, the series also gets emotional, in my view has slow episodes and I found some characters very poorly used, but Band of Brothers is great, with 10 great episodes, It's too much to watch, the soundtrack of the series is great, with a beautiful opening, and a satisfactory and very well closed end. Note 88 Right off the bat, I just want to comment that Band of Brothers is the best dramatic interpretation of World War II events that I have ever seen (think "Saving Private Ryan", but for ten entire episodes). The basic premise of the show is following the 101st Airborne Regiment (a section of the 506th Parachute Regiment) from its entrance into the war ("basic" training) to events such as D-Day, Operation Market Garden, the Battle of the Bulge, and eventually capturing Hitler's famed "Eagle's Nest" hideout and symbolically ending the European campaign. There are two main reasons why I believe this cinematic masterpiece is the best of all-time:<br/><br/>First, is the realism of the war-action scenes. Whether it was the visual spectacle of hundreds of paratroopers floating down into France on D-Day, the intense street-to-street fighting that was often needed to capture certain landmarks, or the trees exploding from German shells in the woods nearby Bastogne as American soldiers dived for cover, the sheer scope of the cinematography is remarkable and will leave you feeling as if you have the slightest comprehension of what being there "in the flesh" must have been like. I remember when "Saving Private Ryan" was released and many film-goers commented on how realistic the D-Day action was...well, Band of Brothers sustains that realism throughout multiple war events. A sight to behold, at the very least.<br/><br/>However, what really makes Band of Brothers special is its dramatic focus on the men of Easy Company (the 101st). The show starts right from the beginning, with the men receiving the toughest training the army has to offer. Grueling runs up and down the infamous "Curahee" mountain effectively weeded out the best of the best and essentially shaped Easy Co. into perhaps the finest fighting force in the entire U.S. Service. The bond that those men achieved during that training carries over into their combat experience (starting with their drop behind enemy lines on D-Day), and makes for a very personal dramatic experience, as each man really did think of the guy next to him as a brother of sorts. What really impressed me, though, was how each episode seemed to focus on a different dramatic angle to the story. A few that stand out in my mind are...<br/><br/>-How Easy Co. handles the incompetence (leading to lives being needlessly lost in one case) of not one but two different commanders throughout the war. -The internal struggle of Frank Winters, who initially leads Easy Co. but eventually moves up in rank. Though he is honored by the promotion, he also is a bit uncomfortable in what he perceives as "leaving" his men in the heat of war. -The devastation that was wreaked in the forests surrounding Bastogne, where more American soldiers (without proper winter clothing) died because of sickness and "trenchfoot" (essentially a completely frozen foot) than due to enemy shelling. Perhaps the saddest moment of the series comes when one Lt. sees his two best friends get their legs blown off trying to help others find cover. The Lt. suffers a nervous breakdown and is never quite the same afterwards. -The level of shock in the hearts and minds of Easy Co. when they stumble across their first concentration camp and liberate it.<br/><br/>Overall, Band of Brothers will both shock you with the intensity of its war scenes and make you think long and hard about the heavy toll that warfare takes on the human soul. A special treat comes at the tail end of the series, when actually living veterans of Easy Co. appear on camera and tell their experiences firsthand.<br/><br/>For anyone even remotely interested in war drama, this series will blow you away. Also, if I were an instructor teaching the effects of WWII, I can guarantee that I would use multiple clips from this series. I had to claim spoiler alerts in this review but I can't imagine that anyone has not seen this amazing series.<br/><br/>The interviews with the original members of Easy Company about brought me to tears every time. This was my dad's generation (a vet in the Pacific theater) and men who were the fathers of many of the kids I grew up with, not that you would hear anything about the war from them. My next door neighbor survived the bombing of Pearl Harbor although I never heard anything about this until after we moved away. That's just how those guys rolled back then. Ordinary men—many of them just teenagers—put in really terrible situations.<br/><br/>This series was one of the first in what is now a long line of episodic TV series that finally grasped the power of TV and the huge advantage it has over feature films: time. Six episodes of a bit less than an hour make for a story-telling format way beyond the scope of movies. Band of Brothers used this advantage to develop an incredible cast of characters and tell one of the most harrowing tales in human history. What more could anyone possibly ask of film making? I first saw this show at an age where I didn't understand it. I wasn't even 10 when it came out. My dad found the box set and we watched it this week. It is without doubt one of the best shows I have ever watched. It's like no other, it really gives you an in-depth look at how soldiers go about their business during conflict. You get to know all of the characters. It digs deep into their personalities and lives back home. It isn't just all about the fighting. It also shows the planning that goes into it and the love a company's men has for each other. Some of the fight scenes are brilliant though. It is also quite accurate with the history too. The fact all of the characters are real life people too. Definitely worth a watch. Best series about war i ever seen. It was recommend it to me by a friend and i was sceptical about this series before and don't want to watch it, but i really felt in love with it. This is a war film that tells the real story what happened years ago... This series is really unique.<br/><br/>No words can describe this feelings i had while i was watching this series. I enjoy every minute. I cried like a child too...<br/><br/>If you don't seen it yet, you have to! I recommend it for everyone who wants to know, what happened in this war, and who likes war movies and series. I can't wait to see it again.<br/><br/>More similar series please! I felt in love with Major Winters♥ And I hate Sobels... uhhhh Great job! Cheers I have previously fallen in love with many war films, there is something they contain that really captures my attention. One of, if not my favourite books would have to be "Saving Private Ryan" in which you are really drawn towards the characters, embracing and acknowledging their experiences and sacrifices under circumstances of immense adversity. The same can be said for this incredible series. Directed by the master Spielberg, it is undeniable that Band of Brothers deserves its place as the highest rated series on IMDb. In Saving Private Ryan, main protagonist Capt. John Miller (Tom Hanks) is an amazing character - much like that of Lt. Richard "Dick" Winters (Damian Lewis), who is in my opinion the focus of the series as the commanding figure of the regiment, platoon etc. he is in charge of. The main difference (not to discredit SPR) is that Easy company of the 101st airborne did exist, and this series was based of factual events. This just adds a special element to the show, and gives the audience a much deeper connection and understanding of the characters and events that unfold. Whilst I fell in love with Damian Lewis in his role as Lt. Winters, the rest of the cast is equally as incredible, there will be actors in there that you would have seen before - partially in their emergence as the series was released in 2001. We see the likes of Donnie Wahlberg, Scott Grimes, David Schwimmer, Ron Livingston and the list goes on and on... whilst there are no real "A-grade" actors, the cast puts on a display contending with some of the finest performers out there, especially considering the pressure placed upon them to do justice to the well respected and admired surviving (and fallen) members of Easy company. This series is truly a masterpiece. One of the makings of a fine piece of film in my opinion is the soundtrack. A good soundtrack can leave the memory of whatever you watched stuck in your head for times to come, and in the case of this series I absolutely loved the opening and music with which it was presented. The music ties in the scenes perfectly, and I believe it adds an element of that thing that makes a show or movie great, that inspirational element. Like many others out there, I am moved deeply by what I watch (depending on what that is), and this was no exception. Whilst the series does have an emphasis on loss and hardship, it left me with emotions of inspiration and admiration for all those soldiers that fought in Easy company, let alone the war itself. This is a great insight into how their lives played out through difficult times, and I felt it to be rather uplifting. Let it be said that this is one of the most beautiful pieces of film I have ever seen, and I would be very disappointed - were you to watch it and feel differently. As the son of a WWII combat veteran and POW, this series helped me understand my troubled father. He likely suffered from PTSD his whole life. <br/><br/>To imagine him in the shoes of the characters portrayed in B of B, it was clear to see that Dad was but a boy of maybe 19 when he enlisted. Then saw combat and quite likely many of his fellow foot soldiers horrifically killed or maimed. I don't know details as he never talked about the details of combat and few of POW camp.<br/><br/>But he would have seen much of what they men in B of B saw, and experienced what they experienced.<br/><br/>This show exemplifies the value that modern film production can bring. An graphic, accurate, and believable portrayal of war that impacts those of us fortunate to have been spared from it.<br/><br/>It gives us tangibility of what to be thankful for when we are thankful to our veterans for the freedom we enjoy today.<br/><br/>Acting... great! Effects... great! Props and sets... great! I could go on and on. But instead, I will just recommend everyone watch it. I am a young adult who did not see this war miniseries until the year 2008. Funny thing is in the year 2001 my close friend told me, "Tonight I am going to watch Band of Brothers." I had no clue what he was talking about; maybe if I did I would have watched the miniseries with him at his house. I also did not even know my older brother was watching the miniseries who I watch films with all the time back then. <br/><br/>I have read many reviews raving about this miniseries, which I agree with all those reviews because I look for historical accuracy in war films. My brother and I both have seen over 4,300 war films, so I know what I am talking about. I know Band of Brothers does have its flaws as I did read the book Stephen E. Ambrose wrote but I agree with Tom Hanks that it was for the best that some details and characters had to go. HBO would have loved to gone all out in its accurate portray of the men of Easy Company; but they had a lot of money invested in Band of Brothers $125 million so 10 episodes would all that be written and produced. Remember this; they built their own sets for Band of Brothers for some episodes (costs money). <br/><br/>I wish they could have added a little more detail here and there but it is an excellent mini-series all around best ever. I have seen many mini-series including Centennial (1978), Shogun (1980), The Pacific (2010), North and South (1985) starring the late Patrick Swayze and James Read, Winds of War (1983), and The Thorn Birds (1983). These are just a few of the many mini-series I have seen in my short life all excellent mini-series. Recently, I have started to write reviews because there should not be bad reviews for such brilliant pieces of work, but people have tendencies to not see the beauty in the work until they are more mature.<br/><br/>I was young when Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks backed an ambitious project back in late 1999, which the series was developed by Erik Jendresen and Tom Hanks not Steven Spielberg as some people might want to believe. Tom Hanks previously, collaborated on Steven Spielberg's film, Saving Private Ryan a year earlier, so he thought his input would be helpful in making of the miniseries. With the actors contacted before filming even began, they knew which actor was portraying which soldiers from Easy Company (part of the 2nd Battalion, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment), assigned to the United States Army's 101st Airborne Division during World War II. The actors had to do a 10-day Boot Camp because the actors needed to get familiar with the gear/equipment they would be carrying, but most importantly they needed to be in shape. I watched the boot camp footage it seemed pretty intense. Ron Livingston seemed not to mind he was enjoying himself during the boot camp.<br/><br/>All of the actors including a few to name Damian Lewis , Scott Grimes, Ron Livingston, Donnie Wahlberg (Mark Wahlberg's brother), Michael Cudlitz, Rick Gomez, Neal McDonough, Dexter Fletcher, all showed something special in their acting abilities. Not to say the least the rest of the cast were magnificent. Readers' who are reading this thinking what he is talking about. Band of Brothers is a war miniseries as I stated in the beginning (everyone knows that who has never seen it would know it) of this review, but actors if they are willing or capable, can achieve many goals when given chance to act in a war film. <br/><br/>I told you before I alone have seen well over 2,100 war films so I have seen some poor acting by some decent actors in war films, which is just not their ideal role, and others which fit them perfectly. It is the realism of the person the actors are trying to show as everyone knows that. I think an actor needs to be able to show he can handle a gun properly as some WWII movies I can clearly see they do not. The talk needs to be as authentic as possible to match the times. When I watch some war films made in all decades German soldiers were speaking English so the authenticity went out the door. Authenticity is important to me The Bridge to River Kwai (1957) awesome film, Patton (1970), Das Boot (1981), Tora! Tora! Tora! (1970) not the piece of garbage called Pearl Harbor starring Ben Affleck. Some German films were authentic. <br/><br/>The miniseries is one everybody should watch because of the friendships formed by the men in the Easy Company and the message it sends to the audience. It is violent to some extent that young children should not watch this miniseries, but a message hidden within the miniseries "Friendship is Priceless; you fight for the man next to you." Friends are few, so people need to have friends that they can trust in times of difficulty, mourning, stress, when filled with anger, and times laughter. It is something that gets us by every minute and every day of our lives. Your partner or wife (if you are married or with somebody) could be your best friend, so it is something to be proud of everyday. <br/><br/>In the beginning of every episode the real heroes (they don't consider themselves heroes as I do not mind) of Easy Company say a few words and one said this in one episode, "From this day to the ending of the world, But we in it shall be remembered- We few, we happy few, we band of brothers; for he to-day that sheds his blood with me shall be my brother." It is so true Henry V is by far one of my favorite Shakespeare plays as the St. Crispin's Day Speech came from the play. See it. Over 10 years now since "Band of Brothers" premiered, and it's still just as spectacular and enduring as the first time I saw it! Unless you were just a babe in 2001, you've probably seen BoB already, but if not...please - stop waiting! Even now it remains utterly amazing. This is the third or fourth time i've watched the entire miniseries since it debuted, and it's lost none of its magic appeal. Truly phenomenal and if ever a title deserved 10/10...I even bought the DVD box set! I was trying to remember why I hadn't reviewed this before, and now I remember it was the silly 10-line minimum rule. What could I say that others haven't said already - except buy this and own it and treasure it! Even if Ambrose fabricated his "interviews" with Ike, he still hit a home-run with Band of Brothers. I feel privileged to be able to watch and enjoy this and will always look with awe upon the men and women who served with such honor and distinction during World War 2!! Is this the best WWII mini-series ever produced?<br/><br/>Quite simply...no - it's THE best mini series ever produced. I came to the phenomenon that is known as Band of Brothers quite late, I've watched it countless times and find something new every time I revisit it.<br/><br/>The reason this mini series is so good is due to three primary factors. <br/><br/>Firstly, the series does not have a TV feel about it at all, more like a big budget war movie epic throughout. The production is influenced heavily by Saving Private Ryan and it shows. The production is superb, the acting performances are superb, the pace is superb. And it's better than SPR for the simple reason that you are following the characters of a close knit team and the subject matter is that much more intriguing for it. We watch the characters evolve from training camp right through to D-Day.<br/><br/>Secondly, the film does not glorify war, in fact in great part, it focuses on the futility of it at times. It is a 'warts and all' documentary where we see poor leadership, breaks in chain of command and unnecessary loss of life. But on the flip side we see the power of human spirit and the ability to survive insurmountable odds.<br/><br/>But the final masterstroke is the inclusion of the actual Veterans themselves (seen at the beginning and the end of each episode). And we have to wait until the final instalment before we realise that these Veterans are actually depicted in the films. Their inclusion adds a certain poignancy and realism to the piece.<br/><br/>The 10 part series is knitted around Major Richard Winters (played by the magnificent Damien Lewis) which follows him through training and a series of promotions to actually leading the company. The cast of B of B is impressive throughout - starting with David Schwimmer who against complete type, plays an arrogant, bumbling CO at the training school. Donnie Wahlberg is another stand out performer in the acting stakes as Sgt. Carwood Lipton. Other notable characters include Don Mullarkey, Wild Bill Guarnare, Shifty Powers and Joe Toye.<br/><br/>Whilst the stories are mainly focused around Winters, my favourite stand out character though is the mysterious Ronald Spiers who was the subject of constant rumours which he never acknowledged or denied (the rumours include supposed atrocities committed to German POW's). The moment when he took over command from Lieutenant Dyke at the town of Foy and ran through the German occupied lines to link up with the mortar team (and then ran back again)was the stand out moment of the series for me. What makes this more amazing is that it actually happened (Spiers had a glittering Army career and ended up in charge of Spandau Prison).<br/><br/>The production was a joint venture between HBO and the BBC which is probably why a number of British actors appear (most notably Lewis). And yet this does not detract from the piece at all (Lewis's American accent is impeccable).<br/><br/>Since Band of Brothers, HBO have released 'The Pacific' and to be honest I can't watch it - not because it won't be any good, but because I will measure it against Band of Brothers and Band of Brothers will win hands down every time.<br/><br/>The best mini series every produced - a triumphant and compelling work which pays a wonderful tribute to the brave men of Easy Company. This ten-part television World War II miniseries based on the book of the same title written by historian and biographer Stephen Ambrose parallels the paradigm of valor with the brutality and revulsion of battle, studying what is both ennobling and dehumanizing about that war. Naturally, the executive producers were Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks after their incredibly powerful collaboration on Saving Private Ryan, one of the greatest films ever made, certainly one of the very best on war, which also gave birth to the look and feel of each episode, in spite of the distinguishing approaches of the different directors.<br/><br/>The narrative centers on the experiences of Easy Company, the parachute Infantry regiment assigned essentially to face unrelenting fire by landing in Normandy. The sequence in Saving Private Ryan where the battalion arrives on the beach at Normandy on D-Day is one of the most relentlessly intense, extraordinarily nuanced battle sequences ever filmed, and indeed here, we are not treated to a recycled version, but a wholly different perspective of the relative experience. Nevertheless, no matter how shell-shocked they feel upon the survival of their brutal arrival, by the final episode of the saga, their experience has gone so far beyond that single comparative blip on the radar of the impacts that have molded them by the end. We begin at Easy's basic training, Operation Market Garden, the Battle of Bastogne and on to the end of the war in all.<br/><br/>One can perhaps understand the criticism that few of the characters attract prominent attention against the background of the war, or that indeed it is all background and no foreground, that when you watch more than one episode and still aren't entirely certain who the main characters are, something is wrong. It is a conventionally adherent criticism made by certain critics at the time of its first air. If it is a fundamentally uncertain series of experiences with the same names and faces, those experiences propel that relentless incertitude, and that is the intention of the show. In Saving Private Ryan, the narrative structure is essentially the same on a different scale.<br/><br/>Moreover, each episode focuses on a different character. We will inevitably, according to its structure as a miniseries, become deeply involved with a single character's subjective forbearance and he will then die or fade into the surroundings of the succeeding character's subjective ordeal. The central character can be argued to be Major Winters, played by the studious Damian Lewis, who is lead for most of the episodes. Ron Livingston plays Captain Nixon, Winters' close pal and often his ironic counsel through the series, and yet we don't truly zero in on him until quite late in the show, when we realize how internalized his true self is. Captain Speirs, played by Matthew Settle, leads the Company into the field in the latter half of the series, but is the matter of rumors amongst the soldiers starting in just the third episode.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, in each episode, we see Donnie Wahlberg, truly a charming and expressive actor, as Second Lieutenant Lipton, Scott Grimes as Technical Sergeant Malarkey and Peter Youngblood Hills as Staff Sergeant Shifty Powers. One episode focuses on Wahlberg and the indispensable power Lipton holds with reference to Easy Company's morale.<br/><br/>I could argue my favorites to be the infectious presence of Rick Gomez as charismatically laid-back Technician Fourth Grade Luz and the criminally underused Shane Taylor as sensitive soul Technician Fifth Grade Doc Roe. Then there is Michael Cudlitz as the ultimate husky cool guy Sergeant Bull Randleman. Both Cudlitz and Taylor were the subjects of their own episodes. The first featured Randleman's escape from a German-occupied village in the Netherlands, and the latter Roe's story as a medic during the Siege of Bastogne.<br/><br/>There's the vivid Neal McDonough as First Lieutenant Buck, witty Brit Dexter Fletcher putting on a near-seamless East Coast dialect as Staff Sergeant Pee Wee, ad infinitum. Some of them are not credited in the opening sequence, and yet they play vital roles at certain times.<br/><br/>Slowly, the characters all take on full-bodied resonance. In one episode, its director, David Frankel, has the visual asset of shooting the grimy troops as near-silhouettes in stark white snow. It's altruistic moments like these that raises this, one of many great recent HBO original achievements, above the omnipresence of its material to take on the solemnity of a synthesized chronicle of past events as aesthetic relativism. As a young fellow from Eastern Europe, with no particular interest in American view on the world, but forcibly supporting the American values, you would have to admit this movie smells like a clean war.<br/><br/>It may be the reality of those men, and it may be the discipline those had, and on top of that it may be what the current generation knows about the WWII, but it certainly does not resemble the war. The war was much worse in those days, not a battle between cavaliers, rather more of fight of rats over warm cow muck.<br/><br/>It also may reflect civilization on the Western Front, but nevertheless it still feel, that if an normal fellow, within a normal family, without a particular political view, without an ethnic angle, could have escaped the atrocities of the war more than often. Cannot comment on the Western Front really, but the Eastern Front was different. I repeat Different.<br/><br/>Far better view over the war can have Idi i smotri, and BoB type of movies cannot claim to view the war as dirty as it is, rather as dirty as it is, but still able to be viewable by the public before hitting your stomach.<br/><br/>When people commented on Schindler's list, one cannot forget mentioning, how clean it comes for the subject it stands for.<br/><br/>All this read, one should not miss this movie in the step of understanding human hatred. The Band of Brothers is not just any ordinary World War II mini-series. It is a masterpiece of sorts. It's hard to focus in on such a broad topic like World War II but they manage focus on a group of American soldiers. I watched the liberation of the concentration camp scene which was touching and devastating. Their discussion of what they knew when or where was frank and realistic. Did they know about Auschwitz or Treblinka? Maybe not there at the moment, the horror of the war was revealed by American liberators at that concentration camp scene. Of course, the Nazis had several kinds of camps as well. They go on to Hitler's winter chalet in the mountains where there was plenty of wealth to feed the country itself. The American soldiers ponder about life after the war and the casualties. War has never been easy now or during World War II or ever. Lives are lost and those who survive must come terms to deal with their life afterwords. I have to say that Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg has done a wonderful job in producing this film which would have won a hand-load of Oscars. This is without doubt one of the finest TV mini-series ever produced.Even though I have watched the entire series three times now,it is still just as powerful today as the first time I saw it.<br/><br/>In very basic terms it is the story of the 101st Airborne division,an American crew otherwise known as Easy company.The series follows the company from their initial introduction into World War 2 through to the conclusion of the war.If you have any interest at all in the subject,you must watch this superb series.<br/><br/>The direction is first rate throughout the entire ten episodes and there are many sequences that are brilliantly filmed.The acting is also very good with special mention going to Damian Lewis as Winters,one of the main characters in this true account.He fits the role like a glove and nails the American accent.<br/><br/>One of the things that I particularly liked about this series is the fact that it isn't a case of how America won the war single handedly,like many movies in the past have appeared to show.It is a very honest account of outstanding bravery,superb leadership and lifelong friendship.It also shows that the Americans were by no means perfect and that crucial mistakes were sometimes made.<br/><br/>Another aspect where this series scored highly was having the original soldiers talking about their experiences at the start of each episode.It made what you were about to watch even more poignant and also made you appreciate just how much we owe these guys.<br/><br/>'Band of Brothers' is one of the finest studies of war ever made and it rightly deserves the very high praise that has come it's way. I just want to thank the directors, writers and actors and especially all the men who fought in World War II. This is the best of all movies / series / TV-programs I have ever seen and believe me I have seen a lot. Band of Brothers is touching, beautiful, and makes you think about life. After seeing this series I would be ready to dumb my life to the hands of any incapable leader and sit in a foxhole for months. This may sound stupid, but the series really helped me to understand the way a soldier has to think in order to do his duty. Maybe I am wrong. Just somehow you constantly think when watching this film that oh my god, what these men, or should I say boys, had to deal with in their life after the war.<br/><br/>This series told the stories that my grandfathers or your grandfathers never could tell since the things you see in the war are just too horrible to be told. I wish people will never forget. But I guess there will always be wars as it must be the natural way to keep people focused.<br/><br/>I love all of you who made this series. The actor choices were perfect, the performances were perfect. I wouldn't change anything. I love it. I've seen it twice and I just wanted you to know that there is no way anyone can ever make a better film. Saving private Ryan and other new war films are nothing compared to this. When I got thins mini-seris on DVD I had only seen one episode, I immediately put in the first of the DVD's and before I knew it I had watched the entire ten hour mini-seris in one day. It is just that good.<br/><br/>From beginning to end it is a fantastic journey that we witness that primarily follow's Dick Winter's and Easy company. Starting with there training and ending with the end of the war this mini-seris accomplishes what no feature film could in showing in depth the tribulation's that these men faced throughout the coarse of the year that Band of Brothers is supposed to cover. <br/><br/>It never slowes down, it never looses momentum and it continues to draw you in until you feel that you know the characters. The cinematography was great, it was filmed so everything looked a little lighter than most films. Also these guy's understood that camera movement has to be motivated by the scene to work. There was a lot of camera movement during the battle sequences that managed to make you feel like you were right in the middle of everything but it didn't go on forever and it wasn't excessive like a lot of movies we are getting nowadays.<br/><br/>The fact that this takes about ten hours to get through simply means that it gave them more time to get you to know the people being portrayed in the film, and learn about the events that they witnessed, this goes far beyond anything that I have ever seen in that perspective.<br/><br/>I very rarely comment about a title but this one warrant's it, this one of the best and most appropriate titles ever given to a film. "We few, we happy few, we band of brothers, for he that shed's his blood with me today will be my brother." That's what this entire mini was about, a few men that layed there lives on the line for the welfare of the world and so many that gave there lives in defense of an ideal, but in the end they fought for each other, the man next to him. I can never understand the terror of war, I can never understand what it is like to be in battle, but this gave us a glimpse, if only a slight glimpse of the friendship, of the brotherhood that went into fighting in such a conflict.<br/><br/>I'm not just giving a recommendation, I am asking everyone to take the time and watch this mini-seris. It is one of the greatest things ever put on film and I cannot stress enough how important this seems to be. See it, you will not be disappointed. I absolutely love this movie. Through this movie you can see, and feel how each soldier felt about the war. There was no flaws in this movie. I love Damian Lewis's character and Frank John Hughes character. They were excellent actors. And also the book was just as great. My dad got the DVD for x-mas, and i love watching it. It took me and my dad about 5 days to watch it. If u don't have it.. u should buy it and watch the special feature disc. It shows them at boot camp, and Nixon's portrayer's video diary.. and u get to see Mrs. Nixon. Plus it has interviews with some actors.  my favorite episode is the one where they go to Bastogne. i feel so bad for the real men who had to go through it. A movie or mini-series like this doesn't happen often in life. I would have to agree with others who have responded here that Saving Private Ryan ranks up there with Band Of Brothers. For me, the only other film that inspired me would be Ken Burns' Civil War. I think that was 14 years ago. I am looking forward to the epic that comes from Spielberg and Hanks about the war in the Pacific. I never had the deep respect for those who fought in WWII as I have now. It has made me appreciate all of our men who have fought and suffered in all wars. I am a Viet Nam vet but served on carriers in the Tonkin Gulf so it is hard to associate or assimilate with vets who participated that way. Thanks to all of you. Action, honor, loyalty, and all those valors which world lack nowadays. Tom Hanks & Steven Spielberg production looks impressive, the scene pretty real, but this is as usual, the fact that when one yankiee dies, not the same as when a german do. History teach us one primary thing, that is, history is being written by winners. On the other hand, this is an essential tv-series for us, warlike fans. If you loved Saving Private Ryan then your definitely in for a treat. The acting is superb. HBO has out done themselves with this series. I'd love to see more like it. To see what the men of the 101st Airborne went through during WWII brings real appreciation to the true Heroes of this Great Country. This is a great homage to those that served the United States during the war. I will forever be in gratitude of those who served. God Bless The USA. This mini series should be shown in every history class in America.  This is the excruciatingly accurate story of a bundle of boys turned into men overnight.  It is the story of the casting off of security for freedom and how high a price is paid for liberty and the kind of boys eager to do heroic things when integrity of character leads them.  This is by far the best thing that has ever been filmed. this is one of the things my eyes have ever seen. anybody who thinks that this movie is no good must be a nazi. WOW!!!!!  When i started watching the dvd i couldn't stop and over ten hours later i found myself in awe of the true stories of Easy Company. After the movie i immedietly went out and bought the  book and started reading up on easy company. they were the most amazing group of men in ww11 or any other war for that matter. anybody Best Creation of WW2 I have ever seen, horrific Battle scenes, Cinematography is superb, Similar to 'Saving Private Ryan'.  Amazing acting performance by cast.  Excellent job Speilberg and Hanks.  Anyone who likes WW2 Films, Should watch this Masterpiece. This has to be the best television series ever.I love it because it's very dramatic, realistic, plenty of action and great character development. I also love this series because doesn't make any historical mistakes like pearl harbour and it has great acting by the British and American Actors. Great series but the only thing I didn't like about series is that it protrayed the British as idiots but I suppose we should allow the Americans their conceit in thinking they won WWII single-handedly This is a great movie and a must see especially if you are a Boomer and your father served in the Army during World War II.  Basically it describes service with the famed 101st Airborne Division from its inception to it's final days of deactivation after victory was achieved in Europe.  It follows the men, both officers and enlisted, and in great detail portrays the many sacrifices they made in behalf of freedom. Actors who were called on to play the many characters who appear do an excellent job in  engaging their roles. The Army is depicted in an honest and objective  manner and our men, heroes all, are likewise also portrayed. This is one movie or episodes I will repeatedly watch if for nothing else than to appreciate even more the sacrifices that were made by this group of men.  The only real negative I perceive is that it makes the 101st Airborne Division appear as though they were the only Infantry Division the United States used in the European Theater of Operations.  The story of soldiers in the 101st was duplicated in many other leg Divisions, (non-airborne), which brought about V-E Day in Europe in May 1945. This is a very good series of movies.  Steven Spieldberg and Tom Hanks did a wonderful job depicting Easy Company and the war.  This movie follows the book almost to the very detail.. I give it a perfect 10!!!! A very well done account of US Infantry soldiers during WWII. This dvd set shows the courage and bravery of the American male. This dvd set deals with the men of Easy Company of the 101st Airborne Division. While Saving Private Ryan shows mostly the horror of war, Band of Brothers shows the trust that one Soldier must put into the other in the time of war. He which has no stomach to this fight, let him depart, But we in it shall be remembered, we few Band of Brothers, For he today that spills his blood with me, Shall be my brother! This is a spellbinding series, impossible to stop watching and one that I expect to watch again and again. Enlightening about a generation that has said very little of what they did during the war -- my late father-in-law was wounded and received a battlefield promotion and NEVER talked about it. My wife and I watched this and could not help thinking of him. The men of easy company show extraordinary courage -- simply beyond belief. Several of the episodes are intensely moving, showing war for what it is: a place where ordinary men become extraordinary amidst the most unimaginable horror.<br/><br/>After watching this series, I suspect I will never again be able to look on other battle scenes quite the same. This series has a feeling, a "ring" of authenticity that is probably as close to being in battle as one can ever be without actually being there.<br/><br/>Possibly the finest "movie" ever made. I heard of this series from my dad, I thought : "God, another one of his WWII documentaries.." I can now admit, I was wrong. At first, I only watched it because I was taping it for my Dad. Then I really got into it. I felt for the characters.<br/><br/>*MILD SPOILERS* I cringed when I heard Speirs shoot the German POWs. I jumped when Winters got a ricochet in the leg, or when he came across the young German soldier in the field, I did almost close my eyes when he shot him. I shivered during episodes 6&7 when they were trapped in the snow. And was quite annoyed when I character I had watched since episode 1 get blown up.<br/><br/>*SPOILER* Special note must go to the episode when they discovered the POW camp. It turned my stomach several times.<br/><br/>The grim realism of this series was excellent, shot in grainy colours, with a lot of hand-held camera work. Made me feel like I was right there with them, fighting along side Malarkey or Guarnere. The SFX were amazing, especially during the jump scenes. The acting is good all round, considering it was by relitivly unknown actors.<br/><br/>After watching all 10 episodes three times now, once on the taped videos and twice on TV. I now feel more respect for these men and what they did and went through.<br/><br/>My favourite television series probably ever, and you should definatly watch it. 10/10 This truly is one of the best series I've ever seen. As a very anti-"American war movie clique" person ("U-571" anyone?), this is a really amazing view of what a solider's life was like in WWII. I completely disagree with the person who said that this was nothing but a flag-waving Americanized version of war. These men could have been British or Russians or even Germans, and it still would have been the same stories of winning and losing, and dying. I also disagree with the person who said they cannot follow who any of the soliders were, since I had a very good idea who everyone was by the third episode. Besides, this is a story about the company - not just a few men. You grow attached to them as the story progresses and their numbers diminish.<br/><br/> As well, I have to say that the acting in this series was fantastic. Damien Lewis, Ron Livingston, Donnie Walberg are great, and the supporting cast were amazing as well. Frank John Hughes, Rick Gomez, Scott Grimes did amazing work in this series.<br/><br/> They really did the real Easy Company proud, and I wished this series got more accolades then it did, since it really deserved the praise. I will be buying the DVD. Being a relatively young guy (24) and only learning about WWII from history in high school and college, it was hard to imagine what this war was really like. Saving Private Ryan did a pretty damn good job of depicting what happened on D-Day and the days to follow. This describes so much more that we didn't get to see in SPR.<br/><br/>I was really surprised to see some of the actors in the series. Ron Livingston from Office Space? Didn't see that one coming. NKOTB Donnie Wahlberg???? He's starting to catch up with his brother now!<br/><br/>I was absolutely glued to the television when this series was going. I couldn't wait to see the next episode. Each episode was a masterpiece in itself. If you haven't seen this yet, do yourself a favor and watch it. I only wish the crappy movies we saw in school were this good!! This is one of the best mini series of all time.... one of the best war films of all time.... one of the best adaptations of all time.<br/><br/>The acting, though mostly understated and therefore unnoticeable as "acting," is excellent.  The writing is top-notch, giving the story/ies dramatic punch without sacrificing historical accuracy.  The direction is wonderful, and virtually seamless from one episode to the next, despite differing directors and writers.  <br/><br/>The battle scenes are exemplary, and ought to be considered the model to which other films strive, as "Saving Private Ryan"'s Omaha Beach sequence was before this.  <br/><br/>Highly recommended to men, women, any and all. "Band of Brothers" is unquestionably the greatest film or series about<br/><br/>World War II ever produced.  It is probably the best about war period. <br/><br/>Having read the book a few years before the series premiered, I waited<br/><br/>on pins and needles for this to be released.  The series is even better<br/><br/>than the book by Stephen Ambrose.  The style of filmmaking used makes<br/><br/>you believe you are moving right along with the men of E Company, 504th<br/><br/>Parachute Regiment.  The grainy film is reminiscent of documentary style<br/><br/>and its use pays off as we almost believe that the action is taking<br/><br/>place in 1944-45 and we are just lucky that the film was saved for<br/><br/>posterity.  "Band of Brothers" will undoubtedly be remembered as the<br/><br/>greatest mini-series ever produced and I believe it to be one of the<br/><br/>greatest films in Americ As I voted 10 on this series, I noticed that another 700 people did it. This isn't casual. For my hundredth comment, I chose "Band of Brothers", since it is an already mythical, and essential mini-series. It doesn't matter the costs. Fact is, this as close as fiction can get from reality. I got chills when I witnessed that air drop over Normandy, it just made my jaw drop completely. It had a strikingly good cinematography, a powerful score, great actors, great scripts and bombshell directing from all the team of directors. A dead sure bet on the DVD sales. It will pass a long time until we can see world war II depicted like this again. Bravo everyone! It was worth the effort! I am sure there will be those who want to nitpick the factual information of this, but as far as I can tell, it was rather true to the book, and thus, at least as far as Stephen Ambrose and the guys who lived it, pretty damn accurate.<br/><br/>I thought David Schwimmer did a much better job as Sobel than I would have predicted, and Lt. Winters was GREAT.  D. Wahlberg as C. Lipton was also good.<br/><br/>Great special effects.<br/><br/>The only thing I don't like is I have to wait a week for part 3. After their successful collaboration on the World War II epic, "Saving Private Ryan", Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg decided to recreate a different aspect of the Normandy landing (this time by air, and not by sea) and recreating the events based on Stephen Ambrose's novel of the same title.<br/><br/>While the subject matter is indeed important, I can't help but be irked by the fact that Hollywood has no shame in profiting on important historic events such as this which claimed thousands of lives. Hot on the heels of such recent war epics as "PEARL HARBOR" and "ENEMY AT THE GATES", 'BAND OF BROTHERS' is a ten-part mini-series presented by HBO and produced by both Hanks and Spielberg. While Tom Hanks does not actually appear in the miniseries, the good thing here is that we are introduced to a crop of fresh-faced actors who are either little known or are making their first-screen appearance by starring in this series.<br/><br/>It was quite a surprise to see Ron Livingston in the series, a comedian who you might have noticed in small films such as 'OFFICE SPACE' and 'BODY SHOTS' and the short-lived sitcoms, "TOWNIES" and "THAT'S LIFE". The biggest mistake was casting David Schwimmer as Captain Sobel who starts out as head of Easy Company, but is quickly replaced after his arrogant ways become redundant. Sure, you may get a few laughs out his sitcom "FRIENDS", but as a serious actor, I find it hard to accept him as being either serious or convincing.<br/><br/>Better high-lights of this series would include the casting of Damian Lewis as Richard Winters, a soft-spoken hero who replaces Captain Sobel and will penultimately become this series' leading man.<br/><br/>The imagery is often gritty and smoky, much like it was presented in "SAVING PRIVATE RYAN". While we are spared the gore as was presented in the first 20 minutes or so of "SAVING PRIVATE RYAN", we are not spared the untimely emotional horror of this particular event in World War II. We see it through the eyes of the men involved and we see it through their actions that are appropriately taken. This isn't a series to be watched while munching on a bowl of popcorn.<br/><br/>While the battle scenes are indeed graphic and most very likely depict how the real events were carried out, you can't help but think - do we really want to remember these things, or forget?<br/><br/>Many kudos to Spielberg and Hanks for enlightening us yet again on this important event in history, and to all the people involved with this project. "BAND OF BROTHERS" is highly recommended.<br/><br/>10/10 This series should be part of the national curriculum!
This series should be shown to every single child in their history classes!
From what I have read,this is as close to authentic as you are ever going to get! I don't do a whole lot of reviews, but this is a series that deserves all the praise it can get. When I am asked what my favorite movie is I always cheat, amd say Band of Brothers hands down lol.<br/><br/>As far as the show itself I believe it to be as perfect as we will ever get. There is never going to be a movie that is a 100% due to varying opinions about everything. We all have certain tastes so to each his/her own. I do feel that this is a series that everybody should watch. This includes people that could care less about war films or shows. It is a pretty difficult show to dislike due to it covering so much. Why should everyone see this?......the main reason is because it is historically important. I know there is some material debated that may not be accurate, but in whole it is important to know history. The show is as good as it gets when it comes to building an understanding of what exactly went on during WW2. This includes what our family members experienced, other countries experienced, hardships the soldiers and citizens went through etc. What really was nice is the show didn't make it a war movie that tries to make the USA look like the only hero, and it didn't just make the opposition look bad. There was a very good understanding that MOST people didn't approve of war, but did it for many unselfish reasons. There was a clear hatred between sides, but that morely showed people being tired of fighting, and lashing out due to the loss of dear friends/brothers at the hands of the opposition. This went both ways! The soldiers created a bond that could never be broken. Having the actual soldiers interviewed you can see the loss in their faces. What they went through dealing with training, losing friends and brothers, dealing with ungodly cold weather while being severely under supplied, being away from home and so much more can be seen in the eyes of these gentleman of the 101st. They have to carry all this until they die, and it is a massive burden. What is especially devistating is when the death camp was stumbled apon. Never knowing about the camps, and just coming up to a voew like that creates a whole different level of hell. What human beings can do to eachother is just abysmal.<br/><br/>Sorry for the long review. Again, I am just a major fan. The acting, story, atmosphere, content and everything else was perfect, imo. I literally cant think of a single 5 minute stetch where I was bored, or disliked something. The problem with Band of Brothers is the fact that I can't see it ever getting outdone. Similar to Saving Private Ryan where it is regularly considered the standard for war films. SPR is a top 5 in my book, but Band of Bros is on a whole new level when comparing the two. When you have time I highly recommend the watch! Even if its with someone that could care less about war stuff you can just woo them by saying that Ross from Friends is an A Hole in it lol. Having read the sources from which this TV Mini-Series gets its material it is unbelievable how true to the source the writers remained. Its fairly typical for writers to take the reigns on creativity and change some things for the screens but that doesn't seem to be the case here.<br/><br/>Instead what we get is a high quality re-enactment of the war from so many perspectives, this is probably the most well balanced show I've seen, and to fit so much raw emotion and story telling in just 10 episodes is unbelievable. I was disappointed that it ended at 10 episodes, but at the same time I was relieved. Because of the short airing the writers were able to compress so much into this show.<br/><br/>Also to mention the actors chosen are probably what make this even more, it almost seemed at times that they were born to play the role as they are so memorable. Watching this doesn't feel like watching a tv show, but it feels like watching history right before your eyes.<br/><br/>It is a truly wonderful experience. To anybody who has watched this and enjoyed it, I highly recommend "The Pacific". I finally just finished watching Band of Brothers from beginning to end and what an incredible mini-series. From the battle sequences of the earlier and middle episodes to the emotional episodes in the end (especially the impact of the 9th episode), this is a true must watch for Americans in order to better appreciate the sacrifice so many young men made for our freedom. God bless America! Band of Brothers is filmmaking at it's best. So authentic. So real without going overboard and grossing out the viewer. So touching and beautifully told. One of the best stories ever put on any screen. Band of Brothers lives up to it's name. A company of men who have faced death together and sacrificed so much that I couldn't help crying in gratitude at the end. Just brilliant in every way. There are a few haters....and I mean FEW. And mostly they are of the political bend, and lets be honest, people that see politics in everything are going to hate everything.<br/><br/>For the rest of the world it's a really great story, very well done, very well directed, and it's segmented enough and switches focus enough to allow everyone a taste of the different characters while still focusing on the leads.<br/><br/>And of course the reveals the people that the actors are portraying, at the end of the miniseries, is worth all the time you devoted to it. One of the best series I have watched. Storytime with real interviews really makes it more amazing as it really happened. Outsanting acting, special effects, sets, directing etc. All-time favorite war series. The decision to watch this masterpiece came spontaneously despite the feeling that it might be something mainstream. And so it was the perfect example when risking is worth the effort.<br/><br/>I am no history expert but I love action games and war movies. From the blank beginning we have a captivating story of a group of people getting ready to rush into the jaws of a devouring machine called war. Never been to a war (and hope never will be) but I know that there you have to rely on yourself and lives of your brothers in arms often fall into your hands. The extremes, which people reach and that are exhaustively depicted in the series create a connection that otherwise would not even be there; and, incredibly, it links viewer to that bond.<br/><br/>From my point of view there was little, or even no propaganda in the picture. Everyone was shown as an unwilling stranger of the global conflict. Some with bad, greedy and revolting features, some with heroic, powerful feats, however, all of them had one purpose: survive.<br/><br/>The acting crew became a family, sometimes for a period shorter than an echo of the gunshot, but still remained in your memory. The intimacy of the situation was flawlessly transferred to the viewer.<br/><br/>Altogether, the 2001 TV series is a phenomenon of cinematography and deserves to be in the top. It has to be seen to believe this fact, and once seen it will cause an immense appreciation to the existence of the motion picture. Almost as good as the wire, sopranos ,oz or treme!
Captivating to a T.
I wanna forget it soon so that I re-watch it Band of brothers maybe made in 2001 but the quality of the show give insight on what the soldiers had to go through to train and fight for their country. The first time I watched this TV show was about 6-7 years ago and back then I thought it was one of the best WW2 shows or movies because of the realistic and authentic approach to it, it was pure entertainment for me at that age but now I find it depressing and sad, I have a totally different perspective on things now and I really believe I experienced it how it was supposed to be experienced as the war and everything the happened to the people and soldiers are just horrible, in fact that almost everything is real except for some dramatic changes, it makes it emotional too see the soldiers dying or getting wounded. The filmmakers and actors made it believable, even the extras did an amazing job. It has one of the finest cinematography, everything is just beautiful to look at. I could listen to its soundtrack for hours, it's incredible and the orchestra is seriously talented. The whole crew is talented, must have been special to work on this big project. The huge<br/><br/>There is a lot of great episodes with superb drama in different ways and all the things and emotions that they go through in each episode makes every single one unique and enjoyable. My favorite episodes has to be episode 2, 4, 5, 7 and 9 as they all capture the emotional impact of war, the horrors.
My favorite characters has to be Winters, Bull, Webster and Toye to name a few, everyone is amazing and great in different ways. The cast truly brought the real people alive in their portrayal.<br/><br/>Superb mini series, one of the best and deserves the number 1 spot on IMDb but 2nd works as well. Everything about it is the highest of quality, impressive production. Band of Brothers will go down in history as one of the great works of media entertainment. It's a very raw and eye-opening experience. We almost feel as though we go through the struggles of these very real characters as we follow them from training, to the drop into Normandy, the multiple battles, the harrowing realizations of war, and finally to VE day. No film or television series has been as unflinchingly realistic in it's depiction of war as B.O.B. from it's severe addiction to remaining as authentic as possible and to capture every (and I mean EVERY) aspect of human conflict; both outward and inward. It's a series I think everyone should see and experience. It'll truly change your view on what war films can be, but also change your view on our veterans for sure. Thank you Spielberg and Hanks. I have watched this about 6 times, bought the DVD and everything.
If you want a good story about WW2 in all its expects this is what you should watch.
The acting is great, the action secens are just incredible, everything is top notch!<br/><br/>Worth seeing more than once that's for sure. This movie will at actually take you to the WWII it was amazing. The actors the direction the story the clothes the weapons the building the special effects are to real. One of the best war series ever made!!! A must watch! The acting and making of this series is just out of the world. I wish I could see more of it I wish everybody could watch this to see not only what the men in the series sacrificed but all the men and women who served a part, whether it was in the military or civilian based help. We owe those men and women everything. 
Excellent acting throughout, and glad to see how realistic they have tried to make it. 
Outstanding series. I loved this story about ordinary people doing extraordinary things Still raking in 9's and 10's for reviews after all this time.
I recently watched the series again and I still don't think another series or film has come near to it for authenticity, depth of feeling and character development and interaction. It still towers above blockbusters like 'Dunkirk'. Though it's never likely to happen, perhaps it's almost time to explore follow on mini-series' to BoB through the viewpoints and eyes of other nationalities caught up in 'total' war, both Axis and Allied. This series is an absolute masterpiece. It's so well written and the actors are brilliant. I'm a huge World War 2 buff and this is my absolute favorite. The historical facts are also pretty spot on. I can watch it over and over again. Listen to me....right now. I dont care if this was made 17 years ago.... if they made a second season of this i would be all over it. This might be the greatest 10 episode series i have ever watched. For 2001 the effects and visuals were fantastic! The uniformes and gear and weapons and patches and just everything were all spot on. Even if you DO NOT like war movies i can PROMISE you that you will like this. I understand movies like Saving Private ryan, blackhawk down, and fury were all great movies. But im not a war movie person as much as i like action, war movies dont rub me the right way they are usually slow.... i liked this series so much i have already watched it a few years back and i finally found the whole collection again and im going to rewatch it. Great series! Incredible, "real" series of the Americans joining WWII. I in particularly loved the first part, where they are in training. It comes full circle over the course of all the episodes. Brilliant sceneries, and great title song. This shows cast is spot on.very accurate in the history.very entertaining.uplifting definitely recommend it An amazing depiction of real experiences that happened to some of the men who saved the world from evil. It really shows you first hand what it was like to go through some of the worst stages of the worst war in history. These men and men like them in the Soviet union, Great Britain and all the other allied nations, are the very reason we can all live our lives in freedom and peace. This masterpiece is an honorable salute to their heroism. Band of Brothers is the truest depiction of WWII I have seen to date. Michael Fassbender, James McAvoy and Tom Hardy didn't become stars overnight. They started out in small roles like these and worked their way up. First of all: I'm a girl and not the typical "audience" here I guess. <br/><br/>My 5 cents: Even the series is almost 20 years old now it is still awesome and not outdated. Every time I watch Band of Brothers I have wet eyes. 
The series is the best war presentation I've seen so far. <br/><br/>It is realistic, hard, emotional, brutal and honest. I really like Damian Lewis as Winters, the other cast is great as well. The music is exceptional. 
Sure it is still a TV Show, therefore it is not completely accurate.
But all in all: Band of Brothers is a high quality experience.<br/><br/>Highly recommended! I could write so much about this masterpiece but i'll stick to the basics.
This is the pest movie/series i have ever seen about WW2.
It feels so real that you think that you are there, fighting with the company.
Acting is amazing and so is the screenplay.
The series soundtrack is a masterpiece on its own but also blend perfectly with the atmosphere.
This is a must for everyone even if you are not a fan of war movies. If you ever going to watch a movie/documentary/series about World War II, watch Band of Brothers...I have seen it more than ten times and it never gets old! Easily a 10/10. This is the quintessential WWII drama; you've come to the right place. Here, a magnificently crafted story is brought to life by characters who you quickly grow attached to. <br/><br/>From the shores of Normandy, to the town of Carentan, to the forests of Bastogne and beyond, each area is lovingly recreated. An even more authentic touch is brought by real interviews with the combat survivors. A couple are heart-wrenching and for a civilian who has never seen combat, they can provide a unique perspective on what it was like to be a soldier during WWII. <br/><br/>Unlike other shows, there is virtually no filler. Each scene has a place and each character, minor and major, devotes themselves entirely to their respective roles. Soldiers shivering in the frozen forest and staring in horror at the labor camp they come across are grounded and believable. <br/><br/>A particular favorite episode of mine is "Bastogne". Here, the soldiers of Easy Company get their first taste of winter during the war and every little detail is shown in a realistic fashion. I enjoyed how the episode zoomed in on one of the medics. Eugene Roe's story of rushing around the line and to and from the nearby town to get supplies paints a good picture of what a day in the life of a WWII medic was like. The subplot with RenÃ©e the nurse is also very well done as well. <br/><br/>Near perfect, this is a title that definitely deserves its high ranking here at IMDb. If you have never experienced a war, you should watch this movie to feel the most realistic desperation of war.<br/><br/>The situation where life can end anytime, the fear that today might be the last, the dark forest, the hunger, the winter cold in the snowstorm, the bodies, the bullets that do not come from where ...<br/><br/>Throughout the First World War and the Second World War, many young people died on the battlefield. Now we live a life that is doubtful that there has been a war, but only 50 years ago, the world was in a brutal situation.<br/><br/>From the beginning of the war, to the end of the war, most of his troops died and only a few survived until the end. Throughout the movie, I feel helplessness that everything is just luck.<br/><br/>How scared the young soldiers were ...<br/><br/>PS: Thanks for reading. Please understand that my English is not good. Usually, a war drama means that there are events happening during a war, with war in the background, with some battle scenes (e.g. preparation to a major attack/combat) or without any. But here, in Band of Brothers, we see a lot of acts of war, fights, explosions, casualties, battle equipment destruction, etc. i.e. the real horror, where everything changes, where young men with hopes and dreams have to cope with totally different things both mentally and physically.<br/><br/>A series like this should be based on real events, of course, as otherwise it would resemble a comic book; luckily, its solid production team headed by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks have understood and accomplished this, for one by adding documentary segments with real E Company members. But the cream of the series are realistic (and apparently costly) battle scenes, and even cast - nobody was "starring" there, we saw teams with characters more or less present on screen, but each and everyone had their significance in the bigger picture. Here, it was my 2nd opportunity (after Homeland) to realize the gift of Damian Lewis, and to recognize in small roles many talented British actors famous by now (e.g. Tom Hardy, Simon Pegg, James McAvoy). As I have recently taken on, the versatility and diversity of a US series or film are ensured by foreign actors, often from UK.<br/><br/>It is not easy to create a catchy work about the events happening in former times, with lots of turmoil, and a few female characters. In substance, the movie team succeeded, and the result is a fine headstone if the battle films history. The series is based on Easy Company, a part of the 101st Airborne Division during World War Two. The ten part series covers the company from the start of the war till the ending, there training in USA to their jumping into Normandy followed by another jumping into Holland, their participation in Battle of Bulge to them entering Germany. It's a facts based picturization covering all the major & minor details of the time and events. <br/><br/>Many of the episodes are shot from the point of view of individual character to give the storytelling continuity, the episodes have been covered from the point of view of the commanding office, the NCO, the medic and the other notable trooper.Some of the performances by the cast are outstanding, Damian Lewis as Major Richard "Dick" Winters is superb, he is the lead for the series being the commanding officer of the company. Other notable performers are Ron Livingston as Captain Lewis Nixon, Major Winters' best friend & Neal McDonough as First Lieutenant Lynn "Buck" Compton. The series got superb casting, few of the minor roles starer went on to become big name in Hollywood. Michael Fassbender, Tom Hardy, James Mcavoy, Simon Pegg & Colin Hanks all played minor roles and this was among their first break on television.<br/><br/>The direction is great, being ranked No.1 TV Show on IMDb is the testament of that. With a budget of about 125 million (this is 2001), it's got higher production values than most Hollywood movies at the time. The accuracy in details of weapons and costumes seem authentic.<br/><br/>This is my third watch for the series in the last 15 years and I believe I may end up watching it again in another 5 years' time, this miniseries is that good. As I said this is IMO one the very few movies/ mini- series that can be rated with 10! For every WW2 enthusiast but not only for those this epic creation is a must watch! I personally love it because of the excellent dramatization of major WW2 historic events with an excellent way that even non-WW2 related audiences can follow and connect with the characters avoiding the stereotype of the all-evil Nazis in the end! As the series goes on and you see the pain and the suffering of these young soldiers you can't but to feel their anxiety to find an answer to the question that might have crossed each soldier's mind "What am I doing here?". But in the end you come to a conclusion that the monsters that they were fighting aren't that monstrous after all but mislead souls that fought and died for what they thought were right just like our heroes. To make matters even more interesting the directors and the screenplay writers don't try to victimize the Germans nor try to show them as innocent pawns. They just show the things just like IMO were. There is good and evil everywhere and a war always brings out your sinister part as seen on the legendary final speech of the German officer to his soldiers! To come to a conclusion I think this is one of the best if not the best production of the duo Tom Hanks - Steven Spielberg and a major tribute to all those who suffered during the most devastating war the humanity ever saw! I loved that movie, so poignant, the music score to band of brothers is so well composed by Nick Kamen. It reminds me the story of my uncle who studied fine arts just before the Nazi occupation of Paris, fought with us troops at The Battle of Monte Cassino in Italy- there were four assaults by the Allies trying to break against the Winter Line held by Axis forces during the Italian Campaign of World War II. <br/><br/>Band of Brothers ranges from the inspiring to the tenderly tragic. the music is truly evocative and emotional.<br/><br/>This movie is one of my best top 50 movies list, All of the actors have played their roles so naturally and with excellence.<br/><br/>This page of history maybe the saddest in history, as once said Avraham Livni<br/><br/>"I know with certainty that the crime committed against the Jewish people was possible only because humanity is a victim of a civilization that continues to be built on the lie that eventually produced the monstrous fruit of Auschwitz " <ul><li>From the first episode , I admired the effort exerted by the executive producers , great locations and landscape deliver the maximum of realism . - David Frankel and the other Directors use distinctive camera filter and colors define the TV show as finger print determine humans , combat scenes was so pleasurable but somehow i felt the insufficiency of suspense and the correlation between episodes . - script fetch a lot of feelings , fine mix of emotions , but the diversity of the leading actors was a double edged weapon , i realized the lack of depth in their characters which leave no way to the psychological analysis of them . - Acting was satisfying but could be much better ,i was delighted with the soundtrack and i felt the musical gratification to the max . 8/10</li></ul> I was a little hesitant to watch this miniseries because i'm not too fond of war movies, but this one was amazing! The acting was amazing, as well as the quality of picture. It was made to look like it was back in the 40's. It's not in black and white, but it has that older look. The actors, mostly British, are absolutely amazing. You really feel like you are there with them participating in the battles, feeling the pain of losing a comrade, and the fear of the battle. It starts with the basic training in Toccoa,Ga, and continues through Normandy, The battle of the Bulge, and Operation Market Garden, among others, as well as the liberation of a concentration camp. If you liked Saving Private Ryan, or even if you didn't, you will definitely love this miniseries!! Once again, Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg created a masterpiece! Band of Brothers has rightfully earned its reputation as one of the best mini-series to have graced our television screens. The critical acclaim that the show has received has been well and truly deserved and you can add a Golden Globe for Best Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television. After the series aired in 2001, Band of Brothers was also a very popular best seller on VHS, DVD and Blu-Ray. Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg have done an exemplary job bringing Stephen E. Ambrose's true story novel to life on screen. <br/><br/>Band of Brothers follows the men of Easy Company, 2nd Battalion, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division with the U.S Army from their early days at basic training through their tour of duty across Europe in World War II including Normandy (France), Holland, Belgium and Germany. Band of Brothers features a large ensemble of characters however the main character of the series is Richard D. Winters (Damian Lewis, Homeland). Also featuring throughout the series includes Lewis Nixon (Ron Livingston, Office Space), Denver "Bull" Randleman (Michael Cudlitz, Southland), Herbert Sobel (David Schwimmer, Friends), William "Wild Bill" Guarnere (Frank John Hughes, Bad Boys), Robert F. Sink (Dale Dye, Platoon), Ronald Speirs (Matthew Settle, Gossip Girl), Joseph Toye (Kirk Acevedo, Oz), Carwood Lipton, (Donnie Wahlberg, Blue Bloods), David Webster (Eion Bailey, Almost Famous), Buck Compton (Neal McDonough, Minority Report), Joseph Liebgott (Ross McCall, White Collar), Donald Malarkey (Scott Grimes, Party of Five), Frank Perconte (James Madio, The Basketball Diaries), George Luz (Rick Gomez, Justified), John Martin (Dexter Fletcher, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels), Eugene Roe (Shane Taylor, Strike Back). <br/><br/>Much of the cast can truly give credit to Band of Brothers for stamping their Hollywood career on the map, with a special mention for Damian Lewis, Neal McDonough and Michael Cudlitz who have been involved in a variety of movies and television shows since Band of Brothers. <br/><br/>Keep an eye out for Michael Fassbender (X-Men: First Class), Tom Hardy (The Dark Knight Rises), Simon Pegg (Shaun of the Dead), Stephen Graham (Boardwalk Empire), Jason O'Mara (Life on Mars), Colin Hanks (Orange County), Jimmy Fallon (Late Night with Jimmy Fallon), James McAvoy (Wanted) and Dominic Cooper (Agent Carter) in early roles. <br/><br/>Though the series showcases the horrors of the war, there's no denying that it evokes a lot of emotions from viewers throughout its time. There's plenty of drama, light hearted moments and some very sad scenes that will tug on heartstrings in which I unashamedly admit that I have shed a tear. You can't but help sympathise with all of the characters from the show given that they are all based on real life people. The authentic realism cannot be faulted one bit throughout the series. <br/><br/>Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg have done an exemplary job with Band of Brothers. Without a doubt this is a one of a kind mini-series that is by far and away the best to have graced our television screens and 15 years later is still very popular amongst viewers. No mini-series has reached the standard set by Band of Brothers and although The Pacific (2010) was still a critically acclaimed series, it suffered from its inevitable comparisons with Band of Brothers. I have been hard pressed to find a series that is as addictive and highly engaging with characters you can feel like they have been a part of your life. Band of Brothers is strongly recommended and you would be doing yourself a disservice by missing out on this stellar mini-series.<br/><br/>A well deserved 10/10. Obviously everybody (or almost everybody) is aware how the second world war ended. But it's one thing to read about it and an entirely different thing to watch it unfold on European soil. And while it is from an American perspective (mostly, with some footage also sneaking in showing what other Allies did), it is not as glorifying as one might have thought it would be.<br/><br/>The show, which aired on HBO and therefor had no issues with showing violence (or nudity, though that is hardly the case here) and language, is all about "keeping it real". Until Virtual Reality becomes a ... reality, this is the closest one will be to be in a war situation, without actually being there.<br/><br/>Before every episode we get survivors from back then talking to us, the great thing being, that we never get their names until the very last episode at the end. Therefor we have to watch and wait to see who actually makes it. It's great drama with great acting. Acting that gets delivered by some of the finest actors even in the smallest roles. Fassbender, Pegg, McAvoy and many more. One of the few that I had issues to see in his role was David Schwimmer. It's not really his fault, but I always think of Ross Gellar (Friends) when I hear him. Suffice to say that this role is very far removed from that.<br/><br/>A great show, which is as realistic as it gets with some superb extras on the Blu Ray Disc version. Why do we need Horror movies when we have shows like this? What men do to each other is much more frightening than aliens hatching out of John Hurt's Chest or Any Number of Robots with Human Skin that look like Arnold Schwarzenegger.<br/><br/>And the reason why this is frightening, is that it really happened, even with the poetic license Stephen Ambrose put into the telling of the story and Steven Spielberg/Tom Hank's switching around of historical events for this Television version of the same book: Which I can forgive because of the total effect this set of movies had. Ambrose told the tale in a personal way, and this was elaborated on in the movies.<br/><br/>I say "Set of Movies" rather than "Series" because each part of Band of Brothers is a short Epic.<br/><br/>I can watch this and feel the Loss that was felt by Lt/Captain/Major Dick Winters and his men each time one of their good friends was killed in the battlefield and their bodies had to just be left there, because Trees were being turned into Sawdust all around them, and bullets were peppering the air like a warm summer breeze (Even though this was happening during one of the coldest winters ever in the Ardennes).<br/><br/>Of all of the reviews in there, I can respect the one by "Arjay24" - Who claims to have been a Veteran of the Sicily Invasion and the 88th infantry division. I can respect this because if he says that this is so realistic that it bothers him, then I can share that with him, and god bless him for saying so, because it bothered me as well.<br/><br/>And his complaint is my complaint - I don't know if it is really a complaint for me, but when Easy Company is taking the Guns at the Beach on D-Day, the sound of the bullets is most disturbing especially in surround sound. If I had lived through that it would bother me as well. As it is, I can barely watch that scene, and the bullets really do bother me a lot, as I would expect it would bother anyone who was in the same situation. So in respect, Mr's Spielberg and Hanks succeeded beyond their wildest dreams of realistic war movies.<br/><br/>I originally watched some of this on The History Channel, when I realized what it was, I instantly went down to Blockbuster - This was when Blockbuster still had storefronts - And I rented the entire series, and I watched it from start to finish.<br/><br/>Where this differs from movies like "The Longest Day" is that this series follows only one Combat Unit from start to finish, from the day they report to training to the day they leave Germany, and all that happened in between, all of the grief they encountered, and I can relate to Private Webster as he is yelling at the marching Germans: "You started this - For WHAT?".<br/><br/>As I watch this, something happens to me, I feel as if these people are my friends, as if I knew them personally, and probably a lot of people feel the same way.<br/><br/>But that is what this series does, it allows us to take part in these events, to see them up close just like the guys who were there.<br/><br/>I tried to watch part of "The Pacific" but that series, as good as it is, does not have the same level of intimacy this does.<br/><br/>I wish nothing but Peace to the men who were depicted in this, those that are still surviving today, and all I can say is "Thank you" for making a difference.<br/><br/>I just got done watching this through for the second time, and it had the same impact on me as it did the first time I saw it. I've seen others say basically it was "too short", but when you think of this, it did not span that large of an amount of time- Maybe a year of Wartime experiences, so ten episodes was just about perfect. The Special Features on the DVD include anecdotes from the real guys, who confirm that the Producers mainly got it right.<br/><br/>I have just learned that Richard Winters has passed away, I want to give anyone who knew him or family members, my highest regards and respect for the man. Band of Brothers is based upon a book by Stephen Ambrose about a Airborne company called Easy Company. The 10 part miniseries which originally aired on HBO takes you from their early training at Toccoa, Georgia all the way till them taking Hitler's Eagle Nest retreat in Germany. The story has everything you want to see about war in the European theater part of WW2. D-Day, Operating Market Garden, Battle of the Bulge, liberating a concentration camp, taking the Eagle's Nest.<br/><br/>The series shows an inside look at what it was to be a U.S. soldier during that time and the sacrifices they had to make, without glorifying war.<br/><br/>The series is a large ensemble of some very talented young actors but most prominent in the series was Damian Lewis and Ron Livingston. I'm huge into war and drama filled movies and when I saw this show I was blown away! This show is about the 101st airborne division and their journey across Europe after D-Day. What made this show stand out to me, was the story of these men and the pain they went through on the front lines. If you think this show is boring and filled with facts, then your truly mistaken. The way Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg tell the story and makes it so historically accurate, and action filled is mind bending. The way they show how a group of ordinary men can band together, and defeat the enemy is one of the greatest messages ever. The book this is based off of is a masterpiece of its own. Overall I give this mini series a 10/10, because of the story, the connection with the characters, and I love history. After watching this series I now know how difficult is was for the men who served in this war, and I salute to them and the men and women overseas for keeping our country safe! Maybe i am falling into exaggeration rating this production as top-10, but after spend a hole day watching soldiers, crews, the cold of Bastogne winter days, bombers, etc., and think on the reality of those images, makes me feel that, was a entire devotion from the producers, staff, and the rest of people who was involved on it. <br/><br/>As a matter of fat, Spielberg produced Saving Private Ryan first and had a fresh idea of what he want to show us in this miniseries, it could be said that both films tell the story from deferent angles.<br/><br/>The critics doesn't fail, the reviewers doesn't mistake, and I'll watch it an hole day again. My dad was watching this once, years ago. I was 10 at the time, and I absolutely loved it!! I watched the whole series, and then another time. I loved the fight scenes, the dialogs and especially the actors. It showed the emotionally and physical problems during WW2. You just couldn't help but feel for the guys! You bond with these guys from the very beginning. And you can really feel the friendships and bonds during their journeys.<br/><br/>It made me cry a couple of times. And I have watched Saving Private Ryan, but to be honest, I liked Band of Brothers a lot more. It was so realistic. I have watched the series 5 times in a row. Now a couple years later, I've started to watch them again, after starting The Pacific, which was a flop compared to this, in my opinion. I really would recommend this to anyone, it is the best series ever! I wouldn't have lasted one night out there in the forest, and these guys say they are not hero's. Man it goes way, way beyond that. I wish I<br/><br/>could shake the hand of every one of them. My Dad served on a destroyer for six years from 41 to 46. He had no business being alive in<br/><br/>1946 with the action he saw. He was lucky just like the guys who made it through Europe to the end. I am so thankful that I realized he<br/><br/>was a hero before we lost him. Watch this movie if you haven't already, please watch it, we owe these guys that much at least.<br/><br/>I wouldn't have lasted one night.<br/><br/>I wouldn't have lasted one night.<br/><br/>not one stinkin night! This is shows D-Day the way that saving Private Ryan should have. I didn't like Saving Private Ryan one bit, but love "Band of Brothers". There is good army type humor there, and anyone who has had military training will appreciate that the situations ring true. There is a certain amount of escapism with the idealized settings in Britain, France and New York, etc. However, this is not overdone. The war scenes also are very realistic, The tension amongst the members of the 101st are there, but they also come together as true friends. The historical events are closely followed, and the story is truthfully told. All in all, very enjoyable. Band of Brothers (2001) tells us the story of the Easy Company as they fought against Hitler's armies during the World War II.This is a ten-part miniseries and its creators are men like Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks.The acting work in this series is unique.Damian Lewis is Maj.Richard D. Winters.Donnie Wahlberg, who recently went back to his roots as a member of New Kids on the Block, doesn't do any singing as 2nd Lt. C. Carwood Lipton.Ron Livingston is Capt. Lewis Nixon.Scott Grimes saves lives in ER and tries to survive here as TSgt. Donald Malarkey.Rick Gomez is Sgt.George Luz.Peter Youngblood Hills is Shifty.Michael Cudlitz is Sgt. Bull Randleman.Neal McDonough is 1st Lt. Buck Compton.Kirk Acevedo of Oz plays SSgt. Joseph Toye.David Schwimmer of Friends appears for 3 episodes as Capt.Herbert Sobel.Those and many more do an extraordinary job playing soldiers in this series.In each episode you also see the actual soldiers of the E company talking about their experiences.This show doesn't try to glamorize the war.It shows the war as it is, a horrible thing that should never happen.But wars do happen, they happen as I'm writing this.There's nothing beautiful about it. This should be made to be part of the school curriculum. It is epic, beautiful, gripping, emotional, funny. I can't find enough superlatives to describe this fantastic series so I'll keep it brief.<br/><br/>I've watched it through 3 times and I haven't felt this way about anything I've watched before or since. (midway through the second series of The Wire and it's running a close second so far).<br/><br/>3rd time through and when Dick Winters answers about being a hero during the war I cried like a baby as I did the first 2 times. But then if you've enjoyed this like me, you probably did the same.<br/><br/>Incredible piece of work. Say you live in Washington n somebody asks you, "Have u seen White House?" And you say, "No". You'll find him saying, "What!!and you said you live in Washington?". Just like that if an Alien asks you, "Have you seen 'Band of Brothers'?" and you say, "No"..you'll find it saying "Sorry dude, I thought you're from Earth". So it's better you see 'Band of Brothers' before getting humiliated by an Alien. I've seen Saving private Ryan but this TV series left a prolonged impression in my heart. Never thought a TV series can me made such a way. Every piece of details was so perfect in it. And almost every actor performed astoundingly well. It made me feel i was on the battlefield physically. Band of Brothers is superlative TV. It illustrates, in a way nothing else ever has, the intensity of war and the feeling of disconnect that soldiers must have felt coming home to civilian life. It really gives you a glimpse of what it must feel like to be talking to a young friend and have him be cut off mid-sentence by a fatal gunshot, or to see another friend lying legless in front of you. My Grandpa served in WWII and when we had a big celebration for his 90th birthday five years ago, our entire family knew without discussing it that it was imperative that we invite his surviving war buddies. They were--are--as important to him as anyone could be. Although everyone with relatives who served in WWII or other wars realizes the importance of troopmates to their loved ones, sometimes it takes seeing something like Band of Brothers to realize truly that these people went through something that only they can every appreciate and understand. I think Band of Brothers manages to be both exemplary entertainment and an important memorial to all of those who served in this war. A recap of the entire jaw-dropping series.<br/><br/>'Currahee' introduces all of the characters that we will come to love over the next few hours and focuses primarily on Winters (who is tremendously captured by Damian Lewis, one of the most underrated actors working today) and how he takes charge of Easy Company as they struggle under Captain Sobel (David Schwimmer).<br/><br/>'Day of Days' provides the first true battle scene of the series, which is absolutely riveting for every second that it's on screen.<br/><br/>'Carentan' starts to show the massive impact that the horrors of war can have on the soldiers involved and the true fear in some of their souls.<br/><br/>'Replacements' begins a long subplot of the soldiers who come into the company to replace those who have died, and the resentment towards them from the boys who have been together for over two years. Another epic battle scene is featured.<br/><br/>'Crossroads' is another perfect entry in the series. I loved the focus on Winters for the episode and how much being in the field with the company means to him. Damien Lewis' performance gets more and more incredible with each part.<br/><br/>'Bastogne' is my favorite part of the series. I was amazed by how perfectly they focused on the strain and pressure of being a medic during the war and the scenes with a growing attraction between Doc Eugene Roe (a flawless portrayal given by Shane Taylor) were very sweet and a welcome change of pace from the chaos at the beginning of the Battle of the Bulge. The way this love story ends is absolutely tragic and had me in tears. Throughout the entire episode Eugene struggles with having to be the person who is forced to try and save everyone, but he becomes rejuvenated in the end and puts him back in the war. A very bittersweet climax.<br/><br/>'The Breaking Point' has probably the best battle scenes in the entire series and some of the most emotional. The way that Ronald Speirs (with a grand performance from Matthew Settle) takes charge near the end is one of the most inspirational, awe-inspiring moments I've ever witnessed.<br/><br/>'The Last Patrol' flawlessly portrayed the emotional impact that the Battle of the Bulge had on those who fought in it, especially my favorite character Malarkey (portrayed by Scott Grimes whose performance is shattering).<br/><br/>In it's final 20 minutes 'Why We Fight' did what Schindler's List failed to do for over three hours. It displayed the terror and massive devastation of a concentration camp. They didn't need to show a bunch of Nazis beating the hell out of Jews for three hours to make it effective. All they had to do was show what was left of these human beings after the Nazis evacuated. Making it even more devastating is the fact that none of the soldiers knew about concentration camps so they had to figure out what had happened and why all of those people were there. A truly horrifying scene.<br/><br/>The final part of the epic series, 'Points' does a perfect job of wrapping up the entire series. It shows that even though the war for these men was over, the impact it had would last in their lives forever.<br/><br/>Overall, it's the greatest thing in any form of media (film, television, literature or music) that I've ever come across and that is not an exaggeration by any means. It is also easily the most authentic depiction of any war I've ever seen. Truly flawless work in every single aspect. I usually write a long narative about the ups and downs of a film and why the rest of the world should enjoy it as much as me. In this case this mini series is something i don't have to convince people to like. It is simply a magnificent in-site to the world of war and a brilliantly cast, written, directed and produced piece of work.<br/><br/>Simply magnificent is the only thing i can say about this work from Spielberg & Hanks. When i finished watching it i though this is one of the best things i have ever watched and i can't think of too many shows that would achieve what series accomplished. <br/><br/>I hope everyone enjoyed this as much as i did. I recently bought the box-set and was not disappointed. I watched the show years ago and had forgotten just how good it really is, after watching one episode i want to watch the next one right away.<br/><br/>I'm not going to go into the story as everyone knows what this great story entails. I love the characters (Based on real men of course) and their personal struggles as well as the problems they face together. I'm not normally a person who watches any war film or Programme but this is better for me as it shows us the story in different perspectives, from the action side, through narration, the friendships, the military briefings and through the veterans themselves telling us their plight.<br/><br/>I think this makes the programme that little bit more special, the reality makes it easier to understand, to believe and try to figure out (You never could) what these men really went through for our freedom.<br/><br/>The direction is brilliant and when you watch, the colour and atmosphere seems so real, the cast all give everything they've got. I've always been a big fan of Damien Lewis, he's a great actor and i love his portrayal of Winters, i also enjoy watching George Luz, Malarky, Guarnere and loads others, i love their individual stories, i particularly liked The medic 'Eugene' story in Bastogne and Hearing Lipton narrate about the forest of Ardennes.<br/><br/>I wish they could make something else as good and insightful as this, something true and real about real heroes, i would like to see another world war two drama, this time from the perspective of us Brits.<br/><br/>Overall i give this top marks, it was heart wrenching and emotional but worth watching every single episode.<br/><br/>Ps- i love the theme music I first came across Band of Brothers when I bought the video game "Call of Duty 2." Then, I got the DVD Box set for Christmas, and watched the whole mini series. I've a seen a lot of WWII movies, but this one was the most authentic and my favorite. The characters are real and each episode starts out with the real veterans of E Company (506 PIR 101 Airborne) talking about how they felt when the event in the episode was happening. I really got into it, and got attached to the characters. This miniseries is very good for a lot of reasons. Great acting, authenticity in set design and costume, and great photography. I highly recommend this for any WWII buff. When I knew "Band of Brothers" was coming as a miniseries, I devoted every Sunday night to watching an episode with my boy, then 12. I was born just before WWII and knew what we had gone through. We watched in silence as each episode spun out and marveled at the realism. I had no idea what to expect when "Why We Fight" was shown. I could barely contain my tears as the camera slowly panned to the concentration camp. I was speechless and had to tell Anthony, as best I could, what it all meant. The final episode, when each of the speakers introduces himself, left me speechless. The next time I was brought to tears was the honor bestowed on Tom Hanks and his team for spending the time and effort and money to bring this to the screen. But, I completely lost it when Colonel Winters was introduced. I have since watched it on DVD three more times. This post may have been maudlin but I have never been so touched by a TV program. I have seen many WW2 films but none have been as real as this, it is an ultimate must have, It depicts the situation as if it were still happening and you were a part. its history come to life. the camera captures the picture perfectly, then the actors bring it to life.<br/><br/>WATCH THIS SERIES!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>The series opens with a flashback, it makes for a perfect opener providing the watcher with a image of the emotions and feeling leading up to the event, and enhancing the power of feeling behind one of the main plot events in the film, it transforms it from a just a starter to an event which shows the courage of the men who undertook this operation, in my opinion this is a better memorial to the thousands who died for this operation, than a piece of stone in the ground it immortalises them forever. Although there are a few historical inaccuracies, this is a very well told story about the men who served their country when they actually had the full backing of their government and the bulk of the population. The acting is excellent and the production, as a whole, is very well done. I watched the entire series when it was originally aired on HBO and have viewed the DVD set several times and it's always engaging and enjoyable. The hardships that these men endured is truly brought to life in the final disc when the viewer gets to "meet" the actual soldiers that the actors portray in the film. The thing that always strikes me is the raw emotion these men feel when they talk about their memories of what they experienced from their days in training to the final days of the war. The camaraderie that is shared by these men is something only they can ever truly understand and appreciate. The one comment that stands out in my mind is when one of the men states that he didn't get friendly with replacements because he didn't like to see them get killed. It's difficult to fathom that kind of thinking unless you were actually in that position. Even with some of the normal goofs that you'll find in almost any film (reflections of boom microphones, continuity issues, etc.), Band of Brothers brings those emotions and experiences to the viewer as no other World War II film that I've watched. From the first time I saw this series on the history channel, I was hooked, I had to buy the set. The realism was the aspect of the film that drew me in, really conveying the gritty and chaotic nature of the battles of WWII. The realistic nature of the series is a welcome, refreshing change from the unrealistic, badly made "Saving Private Ryan" that Tom Hanks also had a hand in.<br/><br/>I also loved the attention paid to the development of characters, it allows you to feel a connection to the characters, giving it an even stronger impact when the character gets hit or dies.<br/><br/>Band of Brothers is easily the most enjoyable film i have ever seen, and i recommend that anyone who enjoyed the series go out and buy the DVDs as well as the book by Stephen E. Ambrose. This 10 part series deals with the story of Easy company,2nd battalion 506 and almost all the incidents shown in this series is fairly accurate.History buffs will love this series because of the accuracy of the story,the amazing work of direction by Tom Hanks and the awesome acting of Damian Lewis (David Winters). This series tracks the progress of Easy company from their basic training with David Schwimmer (Captain Sobel) to Hitlers fortress in Europe.This journey being highly entertaining and jaw dropping<br/><br/>I would say it is a crime not to watch all the 10 parts of Band of Brothers at least twice. As a long-time war movie fan, I give this DVD set the highest rating.<br/><br/>BAND OF BROTHERS is so well done that it will set the standard for other war movies for years to come.<br/><br/>This 6-disk set has excellent audio & video, a top notch ensemble cast, world class co-producers (Steven Spielberg & Tom Hanks who also collaborated on SAVING PRIVATE RYAN), and a exceptional soundtrack.<br/><br/>The story is based on Stephen Ambrose's best selling book by the same title. The acting and the script give the best portrayal I've seen of the close ties that develop among combat troops during wartime.<br/><br/>(SPOILER) The last "chapter" of the set, WE STAND ALONE TOGETHER, is a must see documentary in and of itself. It shows survivors of the combat unit (Easy Company of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division) reflecting on their actual experiences that the DVD set portrays. It's dramatic, funny, poignant, and insightful. I especially LOVE the ending.<br/><br/>To maximize your enjoyment of this set, I recommend that you (1) watch it on a large screen high definition TV with a surround sound system, (2) read Ambrose's book, and (3) buy the soundtrack and listen to it often. Just returned from Normandy batterer where I visited Carentan, Brecourt, and other areas Easy Company fought in. Was truly remarkable to see the movie come alive in from of my eyes. The biggest treat is that I got to meet Bill Guarnere and Edward "Babe" Heffron. They raised the US flag at the Narmandy American Cemetery in the vicinity where the opening scenes of Saving Private Ryan was filmed at. Later we met in Ste. Mere Eglise where Guarnere told me he landed shortly after midnight, D-Day. It was truly inspirational and thought provoking---especially when I head back to Afghanistan next week at the end of this R&R. Amazing...simply amazing. The first time I have ever enjoyed a mini series enough to shell out the $110 it cost to purchase it. A must see without hesitation. Every person should be made to watch this, just to see the importance of why it is we went to war. The men of easy company and all the armed forces for that matter, deserve to have their stories told by someone competent enough to display them. It was both realistic and disheartening. I appeal to everyone who is unfortunate enough to read this comment to go as soon as possible to either your local library, local movie rental store, or however it is that you get movies and see this 10 part mini series. I can say only so much without sounding completely like an idiot...but yes, this is worth every penny you spend to enjoy it. If you are at all a fan of perfection in media, than you must see this. This movie will end up in the top ten of the best movies ever made, probably number 1. It is a marvelous movie! I am on my sixth viewing of it and every time I find something I missed the previous times. I recommend watching the movie and then reading the book and then watching it again and again. The first time is spent sorting the soldiers out and a viewer misses a lot of what is going on-like knowing it was Lt. Meehans's plane that crashed, killing all aboard. Some of the stuff is rather subliminal-like Winters' appearance. Always neat and shaved, the person to respect for many reasons. A man of few words, a quality which his men seemed to have, too, but every man knew how he felt about them. I can't say enough good things about this movie but it is a movie to treasure and watch over and over. I've now watched the whole series 7 times and it gets better every time. And I still find things I missed. I thought it terrific the first viewing and every viewing since adds to that feeling. Don't miss this movie!!!! Incredible! I rented the first 4 episodes from "Blockbuster" just to see what the fuss was all about. 4 hours later, I was renting the rest of the episodes. After watching the whole thing, I went out and bought the DVDs. My love of good drama, combined with my infatuation of history and especially World War II history, made this is a "must have" for my collection. The beauty of the series is the viewer feels a bond with these characters. You've gotta pull for Carwood Lipton and feel a sense of pride as he rises through the ranks. The special friendship between Lewis Nixon and Dick Winters is one that we can all relate to. The emotions that "Buck" Compton experiences as he watches his friends, brothers really, is gripping, leaving the viewer wanting to know more about him. "Bull" Randleman spending a night separated from his troops in a Dutch(?) farmhouse surrounded by Germans in one of my favorite parts. The list goes on and on. Since my initial viewing, I've probably sat down and watched, in it's entirety, the series 3 or 4 more times. I've also caught episodes on the History Channel. I've bought all the books, with my most recent one being authored by Major Winters. I also have a photo of the D-Day jump signed by "Wild Bill" Guarnere. I may never get a chance to personally know these heroes. But, I know their stories as they are presented in "Band of Brothers". These were boys, much like my family members who fought in WWII, who were fighting a war many thought they didn't need to fight. Yet, they were fighting a war for all humanity. This series shows that these were not men looking for personal glory, but were fighting for a cause; fighting for their friends; fighting for their families; more so, fighting for their country. There is no greater cause. If you watch this series and don't come away with some renewed sense of nationalism, then you may never experience the joy of loving something so much you are willing to risk life and limb for something other than yourself. Best WW2 Mini Series ever. Period.<br/><br/>Nothing anyone can say can surpass the undertones of futility in war, and express the emotions that the men of the E Coy, 506th Paracute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division have portrayed in this brilliant Mini Series.<br/><br/>Highly accurate battle depictions, fluid transition of story line, depth of characters, and an emotional roller-coaster of action, adventure and despair are vividly re-produced onto film, and tell the story of just how it was, from the historical and personal point of views, and recollections of the men of the Easy Company.<br/><br/>The characters selected to portray the men involved in these epic battle of WW2 and the Operations thereafter, are superb. The emotion, action and flair, as well as the character portrayal are all first class and my congratulations go to these men for getting it right. <br/><br/>This is the benchmark that War documentaries/biographies/mini series be based upon. <br/><br/>The men of Easy Company displayed a courage and conviction that is shown through this wonderful series, and I encourage people off all races, nationalities and backgrounds to honor these men, by hearing their journey, their story, their sacrifice.<br/><br/>As is stated in the Final Installment: <br/><br/>"I wasn't a Hero, I was in a Company of Heroes". When this was first on TV , i was not sure how to actually take it .<br/><br/>I soon came to realise that this was due to what I was watching was a true rendition of what had actually happenedand not just a Hollywood (or hatfield actually) story.<br/><br/>I now own the DVD set and watch it quite regularly, but I will also watch the repeats (re-runs to our US readers)when they are on TV , in any order.<br/><br/>Every episode is so dramatic.<br/><br/>Dick winters is obviously the focal point of Easy Company, and if one aspect alone shows what a great leader he was , this is at Haganeau . where he doesn't actually send the men on the following mission.<br/><br/>There is a campaign to get him the CMH . In recognition of EASY company and the rest of the 506th PIR , of the 101st Airborne , I really hope that happens .<br/><br/>Do all that you can to watch this series, and then tell me you didn't well up at some points. This is one of the best movies/mini-series about WW2 that I have ever seen in my life. It is powerful and really makes you think about the horror that American soldiers go through to serve their country.<br/><br/>The plot is excellent, the actors do an excellent job, and the historical accuracy is almost as good as it gets. It also examines the war from different perspectives and from different people. One of the best things thou, is that it actually shows interviews from actual WW2 airborne veterans. This is a must-see for everyone fifteen and older and I cannot imagine any reason why you would not be affected by this series. When this mini series came out it was interrupted by the terrorist attack on NYC. In fact it was 2 days before. The first two episodes (they were run back to back) were compelling, so compelling in fact on September 13th I went into Brooklyn to join up (bad knees and back prevented me from avenging my friends deaths.)<br/><br/>More recently I have been re-watching the series on HBO on Demand. I realized that this show was not pro-war or anti-war (for the most part) but more to show brotherhood between men. I say for the most part because part 9 is enough reason for war.<br/><br/>Again go see this, rent it, own it. Show it to friends and family. Even the kids (when you think they can handle the gore.) It is important for the next generation to know what the greatest generation really meant. Now... I'm not usually a type of person who loves war movies and stuff. Most of the time I find that they just shoot and blow things up. But my boyfriend bought this miniseries and began to watch it - I watched it with him, and it's really well done! It has given me a lot to think about, and most probably because it's so realistically done. Nothing is hidden - you see everything, as it were back then; when people are shot, they don't hide blood or wounds from the viewer. You see everything, you are with the men through all their experiences; when they talk in the foxholes, you get to know how important the medics were. I never thought they did so much for the injured, but every time something happens, they call for their medic, who comes and does his best to help the wounded. I have learned a lot about World War II from this series, a lot of things I never knew or guessed. I felt with the men, what they had to go through. All while thinking "this actually happened", I just feel how horrible it must have been.<br/><br/>There's an episode, where Winters gets a little time off, and is sent to Paris to relax. He comes just from the cold and real war, to this city where people just live and have normal lives, they have fun and enjoy a night out. And it must seem so strange to Winters, who came from a place where people were killed and injured, where dreadful things were happening - and then to Paris, where all seemed to be calm.<br/><br/>And like I said, so realistic. The Easy Company come to a KZ-camp, where they find a lot of dead bodies and a few survivors. Just to think, how it must have been to come and find such a place... see those horrors. That really just had me thinking. Of course I've learned about it all in school, but this made me understand it so much better...<br/><br/>all in all, I'm glad that my boyfriend bought this miniseries. I recommend it to everyone, not just people who like war movies and stuff, but also people who never thought about it. See this, and learn! the best mini series ever made bar none. nobody i know that has seen it, even if they have no interest in war movies or shows, doesn't LOVE it. the acting, the storytelling, the effects everything about it is top class. bought the box set when it came out an i still watch it from start to finish every few months. <br/><br/>the way the story is told u actually feel like your there in the fox hole getting the sh*t shelled out of you in the freezing cold in the middle of a forest in Belgium and u haven't slept in days... its just unreal. <br/><br/>hanks and Spielberg done the men of easy company 506 PIR great justice<br/><br/>!!!!!!!!BRILLIANT!!!!!!! Somewhere between 'The Longest Day' and 'Saving Private Ryan' lies 'A Band of Brothers! It's actually more of an anthology than a movie. Excellently photographed and scripted, very moving and touching at the same time. Totally believable and gripping, depicting before, during and after the war what the men went through. The beautiful scenes of Austria and the Alps after the war are not to be missed!!! You also get to see the actual men as they are today after the last episode. Sgt.'Wild Bill Guynaere still lives in the Philadelphia area and still makes public appearances at age 83!!!! Go to any search engine and tap-in 'Wild Bill' to get his website address !!!! :) I first saw this when HBO ran it in 2001 and was completely awed by the scope and work that went into the series. First off, the actors. Each complemented the man they played and gave the viewer a glimpse into the man that the viewer wouldn't normally get. It was nice to see David Schwimmer as something other than the goob he plays on "Friends"! Damien Lewis, Ron Livingston, Mark Wahlberg and the rest of the cast are excellent! <br/><br/>Second, the settings. Until now, I didn't know almost all of the exteriors were filmed in England! This was some incredible work! <br/><br/>Possible spoiler ahead!<br/><br/>Lastly, there were several episodes that will stay with me, the most memorable being the show where they come across an abandoned prison camp. I had (and still have!) a hard time watching that one! <br/><br/>Bottom line: you leave the show with more than just the average war movie. You were watching history being formed by everyday men doing extraordinary things. God bless'em! Even if it were a complete work of fiction, Band of Bros. would still hold up as a masterpiece of film making. But its being true makes it touch all the senses in a truly profound way. From the true-to-life locations, to the unknown actors who brilliantly recreated their namesake's struggles, to the stunning camera work- Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, two of our generations most gifted film makers, truly did justice to this important and fascinating account in our world's modern history. We are delivered to the period by means of an innovative mix of soft muted colors, which almost seem like black & white- playing to our mind's eye of the period, comprised of olive drab army fatigues coupled with historical documentations of the war which of course exist almost entirely in black & white. Though the piece is comprised of ten "mini movies", each an accounting of a distinct and important part of this company's journey into and out of WWII, one becomes "hooked" within the first installment. Showing both the foibles and the heroics of these real men, it connects a generation of baby boomers who, as it turns out, really had no appreciation of how mad the world had just a short time ago, nor how incredible the sacrifice and bravery were in delivering freedom- and making the lives we now all enjoy even possible. Band of Brothers, even the title makes me feel good! I absolutely loved this series! I watched it religiously on T.V and then brought the DVD box set which was worth every penny! The box set makes you realise the terror of War, and how soldiers bond in conflict like no other! It shows you how men were tore apart over the loss of their comrades, and how the events of war scar a person physically and mentally. The film follows the events of Easy company and the 101st airborne! This company was argued to be the toughest and most disciplined in the whole 101st, and this is certainly shown in the film, from training in camp Toccoa to the end of the war in Austria the film keeps you gripped and interested in the events of Easy company! To be honest, no comment can be written that can explain this series! You have to watch it for yourself! This is without a doubt the best World War 2 series i have ever seen! It makes you respect the men of Easy company and all those that fought in the War! I hope you take into mind my re-view, and watch this film! Regards, Scott. I missed BOB when it first premiered on the television network HBO. I finally checked the DVD set out from a local library and began watching it. I enjoyed the series so much that I watched up to three one hour episodes every day. This critically acclaimed war series features the men of Easy Company, 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne. It follows the men from their intense training in Camp Toccoa, Georgia to the capture of Hitler's Eagle Nest in Germany. They encounter death, sickness, and fear as they fight numerous battles and protect each other, living up to their title, the Band of Brothers.<br/><br/>This series features mind-blowing battle sequences, well-done dialog, and most of all, an accurate depiction of what E Company went through to win the war. At the start of each episode their are interviews with the real-life heroes of E Company, all men you will encounter as you watch the series. One of the many things that make this series so great is the music. I highly recommend the soundtrack. The music really creates the mood for the episode, beginning with the BOB main theme at the start of each show.<br/><br/>This series does not glorify war, on the contrary, it shows the terrible hardships these men had to go through to win the war; the worst of these being the men they had known for years dying around them constantly. It has some very emotional scenes, one of them being when the men find an abandoned concentration camp. I highly recommend that you purchase the DVD set. Next to Saving Private Ryan it is the best war movie ever. The characters are very well defined, the way the scenes are made, the dialogs and especially the war drama are getting you as close as it can be to those dark days in the history of humanity. But what really got me were those war veterans who say few words at the beginning of each episode. They were really there. They lived that terror, they have seen it with their own eyes. And it really touches you to see how alive the memory of those days is for them, even if it has been 60 years. You can see the tears in their eyes. I've seen the movie twice and the first time I did, I stood for 10 hours in front of my TV. But that's just me... a war movie addict. You really don't want to miss this movie. I would challenge any one to argue other wise. My opinion is that this film/mini series is in no way over rated or even comparable to saving private ryan. There is so much more to this mini, its as blunt as it can possibly be with out being offensive towards people who can't handle the truth of war time europe (Which in all fairness is still a lot of people).<br/><br/>That aside you are engaged from the start your there when the men train your there at D-day your there for market garden etc. You see them witness and experience so much, a lot of what is being put out from the scree actually happens and as i being told by the people who where there. The affects of war are shown and your just spend 10 hours with these men and you see what happens.<br/><br/>Brilliantly shot and film by hanks and spielberg every fight scene was as intence as the one before it. Constantly on the edge of your seat its looked so real. Never knew what was going happen or who would live or die for that matter.<br/><br/>This i found was a powerful and moving story that was well present and engaged you, made you feel like you where really there and they you could relate to how they would have felt in a way much more than private ryan did I'm not deny thats its not a brilliant film I'm just saying that there is so much more to this, i have been to the grave that saving private ryan is based on in France. This was just some thing else entirely so much more profound, so much more real. but its only my opinion Everything about Band of Brothers is perfect. Theme tune, graphics, acting, the set, the pace, and most importantly of all, the placing of the veterans' information at the start of an episode. Whether Spielberg and Hanks struggled to get the budget or the project done on time I don't know, but this is better than anything on both their impressive CV's. Damian Lewis is excellent as Winters, but all the actors are spot-on, a real feather in the cap of the casting crew. The locations are impressive, as is the use of the "drained" colour which makes things even more realistic. A truly memorable piece of television. As good as anything ever made. Without a question the finest war documentary/movie/miniseries ever made, I'll even go as far as saying that it's one of the best motion pictures of all time. Too bad TV movies and series don't get Oscars because this thing would sweep them all aside, it should be #1 on the IMDb list.<br/><br/>One can only speak in superlatives about this, near perfect acting, amazing storyline, superb character development and amazing adherence to reality. Everything about it is so real in fact that it has effectively set a bar which every single other war movie ever made is under, except perhaps tora tora tora. either future war movies have to be as good as this or risk looking bad. It doesn't even stoop to patriotic or heroic clichÃ©s, it sticks to the truth of what happened and nothing more.<br/><br/>This is an absolute must-see for everyone. Honest, heartfelt and inspiring depiction of Ambrose's excellent book. Top shelf everything! Memorable characters and great acting by mostly little-known cast. Well-researched, the sets, costumes, locations and photography are all excellent, notably many of the battle sequences that make you feel like you are there. Some of the Normandy invasion scenes shot in and amongst the planes in the air are stunning. The overall effort benefits immensely from the extended format. The comments by the actual veterans that appear off and on at the beginnings and endings of the segments are often extremely moving. I had read how sincerely the actors delved into their roles, often interviewing and spending time with the actual men they portrayed. That care shows. It would be difficult to see this series and not be deeply moved. A great moment in film making about truly great average men who rose to the occasion and saved our world. (I made my Dad, who was a WW2 pilot, a gift of the series, and my Mom tells me he's just about worn it out. There really is no greater complement.) I have never been a giant fan of the war film genre. I have not seen "Platoon," "The Deer Slayer," or "Apocalypse Now." This film series, however, is one of the most touching, moving, and breathtaking works that I have ever seen. Following Easy Company on their trek through Europe is fascinating and terrifying. At some point you really get to know these people as true individuals, and by the end of the series, you feel you know them intimately. Technically speaking, every aspect of "Band of Brothers" is above and beyond the call of duty. Sound, editing, direction, cinematography, and (WOW) the acting is exceptional. I think everyone should see it and even believe it should be required for High School History courses. Thank you HBO for giving this project the green light. I had not heard much about "Band of Brothers" before I began watching it. I somewhat expected to be disappointed.  However, despite the erratic viewing because I was renting the tapes, I found myself being drawn in from episode to episode.  I think bought the DVD set and have watched it all the way through at least twice.  It's quite impressive, much better than I expected. It's also a series that benefits from more than one viewing.  After you've seen it once and gotten an idea of the cast of characters, it's quite moving to go back and view the episodes knowing the destiny of many. In addition, you can relax and enjoy the portrayals a bit more without working to keep track of everyone.<br/><br/>(Spoilers) <br/><br/>I found memorable moments in every episode: Sobel's face when Winters chooses court martial and when removed from command; Winters staring out the doorway of the aircraft at the end of episode 1; the D-Day drop (a very strong episode); the company walking into Bastogne; Winters shooting the SS trooper; most of the episode about the medic; Dike cracking up in the attack; Eindhoven in flames; Gottlieb translating to the concentration camp survivors; Nixon after the drop with the 17th; etc.<br/><br/>I've gotten a lot pickier with my military movies as I've gotten older.  I found "Behind Enemy Lines" to be simply silly because it moved so far from anything realistic. Band of Brothers has a real sincerity about it's attempt at recreating the past.  The best review I've read is in this collection of reviews in IMDB. A veteran from the Italian campaign stated that he found Band of Brothers very moving, but he couldn't watch it again.  It hit just too close to home for him. Following Easy Company from their Currahee training camp, under the command of a much disliked leader, to the beautiful mountains of Austria and eventual peace...this mini-series is quite possible the most remarkable thing to have graced the our television screens, ever!<br/><br/>Band of Brothers charts the rise a great leader and inspiring war hero. Richard Winters was a tactical genius on the battlefield, and indeed, a great man.<br/><br/>There are many emotional moments throughout, with characters you get to know being killed, and seeing the psychological effects of those who took part in the great battles of WW2.<br/><br/>I honestly dont think I have seen anything, on big or small screen, which comes close to the emotion put into Band of Brothers.  Episode 9, entitled "Why we fight"...does exactly that...it serves as a timely reminder of why they were willing to lay down their lives to defeat the enemy.  The episode follows the discovery of a concentration camp and the effects that the discovery had on the men of Easy Company.<br/><br/>The whole series was amazing, and one that everyone should watch.  I could talk for way more than 1000 words about Band of Brothers...but think it probably best that you just buy it and watch it if you havent already done so.<br/><br/>10/10...and well deserved. I salute those who have been through world war 2 - the pain, anguish and sorrow. I thank the film makers for narrating the story so that we who live in these modern times will not forget the legacy that they have left behind. This 10 part series on HBO allowed for a good deal of well thought out, nuanced character development that could never be accomplished in a single 2 hour movie. There were no artificially constructed plot lines or plot devices needed to make this real life story thoroughly absorbing. Some of the action sequences are among the best ever put on film. Kudos to Spielberg, Hanks, the writers, the actors and of course the men of the 101st Airborne. Reality, what a concept.  We all wonder at our mettle.  What constitutional core one must have to have persevered the tribulations of Easy Company. I've never seen a motion picture as real as this series.  Isn't that the ultimate goal of the motion picture industry: to reproduce reality?  A Ten. I saw this HBO mini-series in 2001. I was fortunate enough that my local library had a copy of it (with a 2 month waiting list) and viewed it again. This Christmas, my daughter bought me the whole CD version and I have thoroughly enjoyed it. It is one of those movies that the more you watch it the more you enjoy it. Do yourself a favor and buy the CD, it is worth every penny of the $70..... especially if it is a gift!!!!! My favorite war film was once saving private ryan. but there is something this series has that SPR did not have. After going back to SPR I only admire it for the technological aspect. The characters in Band of Brothers is the main driving force. The transitions, the score, and the acting is top notch. The film does not bombard you with mindless action. You are watching characters you care about getting there legs blown off. I found my self in tears more than once watching this series. Go out and watch this now. Hell buy the dvd set. It is loaded with extras and worth EVERY PENNY. Anyone who has studied WW2 will identify many nuances of the personal soldier reflected in this brilliantly written, directed, filmed, and acted piece of art.  In addition to that, the opening and closing score is pure genius!  Highly recommended! Undoubtedly the best war epic that has even been put to film. I have serious doubts that another series will exceed the excellence of "Band Of Brothers" within my lifetime. A MUST see. This movie shows so much!<br/><br/>There are very good made battle scenes (Day of Days, Carentan...). But we also see the emotions and the changing of the men through war. We see how the soldiers learned about the KZs...It is great and epic!<br/><br/>But, my most important thing to say:<br/><br/>As i found this i first thought, (mini)... A series, come on, the people give it good votes because its not a real movie. Now i saw it myself (the whole 10 parts in 3 days!), and it really is magnificent.<br/><br/>For me one of best WW II movies; OK, Schindlers List was better; but still a 10/10. This miniseries was like the men it portrayed.. the best of the best. Captivating score, awesome scenery and special effects and powerful performances. Never seen anything like it. This is among my favorites of all time. I guess I can say this without any doubt. The best series ever made for TV. If you haven't seen it, do so, if you did, then you know what I mean.<br/><br/>Even though this series has been dedicated to Easy Company, anyone who had their family fighting in the II World War (both my grandfathers fought in the Polish resistance) can feel the pain of those people. There really isn't much to say, if you have a 100 dollars to spend for anything, buy this DVD set.<br/><br/>Let the souls of the people fighting in the II WW rest in peace, let's be thankful for their great sacrifice.<br/><br/>God Bless Actors, directors, filming crew... all did a hell'ova job in this one. Definetely one of the best war movies ever made. All episodes are real masterpieces and though there are ten of them, you watch it like a single movie. Terrifying but realistic sights of WWII, just as seen in "Saving Private Ryan"'s Omaha Beach scene. Real veterans' comments, interesting facts in the end of each part and so on... 10/10 no this may be the pinacle of war dramatization, the story telling, the fighting, the emotion, all brilliantly done<br/><br/>this blows saving private ryan out of the water<br/><br/>if there is one thing that could beat it, it is the new WWII miniseries by the same people coming out in 2005, it is set in the Pacific Excellent TV series! Wonderful actors and actresses and a very good score. If you like "Saving Pvt Ryan" you'll like this series. The first time I saw "Band of Brothers" I was totally impressed. I am a big fan of all WW II movies and a friend of mine told me about this mini. Therefore I decided to watch it. Before doing that, I must admit, my look at war wasn't accurate. Now I know what a war means in a much better way. I could spend hours describing it, but it would be better if you watched it yourself. I really recommend it to everybody. Sometimes the scenes are too rough (blood, suffering), but it was war, you can't expect anything else.<br/><br/>Great acting. Great story. Simply one of the best I have ever seen. Can't add more... Many films use WWII as a background for their stories, but BAND OF BROTHERS tells a true story of the war, by telling the biography of Easy Company.  This is the best documentary-drama I have ever seen, and is comparable to SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, THE ENGLISH PATIENT, and THIN RED LINE as the best WWII films. Easy Company is part of the 2nd battalion of the 506th parachute infantry regiment of the 101st airborne division; the first paratroopers.  BOB tells their entire story, from training in Georgia to the end of the war in Germany and Austria.  BOB vividly depicts the last two years of the war with the lives of the men in Easy.<br/><br/>An excellent  narrative of leadership, soldiers, life and death, bortherhood, the army, good and evil, valor and cowardice - BOB amazingly includes almost every important facet of war. Buy the special edition tin - it is the best DVD set I've seen! Comparable to the special editions of THE LORD OF RINGS. Wow, just wanted to say that this is far from boring history and it changed my opinion of my grandfather and father. Usually when my grandfather talked about World War 2 i would get bored and think that war was nothing great. Now I have a lot of respect for him because I have a better idea of what he went through.This excellent miniseries manages to be accurate, while at the same time very entertaining like a mini movie. They are all great but the best is Carentan (episode 3) because my grandfather says that it's just as he remembers it, and it is the intense one of the series. The way that each episode tends to focus on different people for a particular episode shows some great storytelling, as it shows how everybody was affected by the war. 10/10 This is a singularly great series.  Spielberg and Hanks have set the standard for what is possible with the medium.  It is for us to appreciate this, and through it, the contribution of one of the great generations in the history of this country. I saw it recently. BoB is not about an unique character, is about a group of MEN united by blood and fire. Is very much alike Sven Hassel's characters, excepting the fact that in BoB they are presented as a whole, unlike Sven's books.<br/><br/>The sets are great, the equipment and weapons very accurate, but I have a little question. In the second episode, the squad must destroy a battery of german 88's. Of course, the 88 is in fact the German Flak - which was usually used as a AA Heavy gun. In the movie, are shown only german 75 cannons. How about that guys.<br/><br/>In rest, everything and anything is excellent. I never thought TV could be this good. A group of mostly unknown actors anchor what is easily the finest miniseries ever put to the screen. This is FAR superior to even most war films that have been made before. Most important, it gives us just a glimpse of the true horror that these men went through to rid Europe (and the rest of the world) of Hitler, and end the second world war. It's a shame it has taken us 50+ years, but maybe now we understand. Perhaps the best complement that can be bestowed on the series was mentioned by an actual member of Easy company when he viewed the screening at the premier in Normandy. He said "That's not Hollywood, that's real."<br/><br/>Kudos to Spielberg, Hanks, and everyone else associated with this masterpiece. 10/10 Spielberg learned many lessons from Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's list and worked well with Tom Hanks and numerous other excellent film makers to take, historian, Stephen E. Ambrose's powerful book and turn it into what I would say was the best television ever.<br/><br/>The wonderfully acted story of a group of ordinary men who rose to the challenge of war and went halfway around the world to fight and become heroes should be mandatory viewing for every future generation.<br/><br/>Throughout the 10 episodes you feel every emotion with the men due to the amazing realism of the filmmaking and characterization.  Personally I don't know how they got through it.   Seeing the soldiers as they are now at the start of each episode adds significantly to the overall influence of the film and this is added to at the end (and with the DVD extras).<br/><br/>Although being a powerful war film featuring many harrowing scenes, I personally felt it didn't resort to the retch inducing images of the first 30 minutes of Saving Private Ryan.   Where parallels could be made to Schindler's List, I also felt scenes were handled well.<br/><br/>
As always the book certainly contains more information and as such I would recommend reading after the film so you can extend the marvelous performances of the actors in your own mind.<br/><br/>If you haven't watched this yet then start watching it on the Friday of a free weekend as I'm sure you'll want to dedicate the weekend to sitting in front of the TV and DVD.    And at the end of it you will be a better person for it. I need not say just how spectacular this series is, 10 hours of some of the best war filming ever produced by the species that we called mankind. No matter how far we as a culture evolve, no matter just how far our technology advances nothing can ever match up to this.<br/><br/>BoB's is able to bring to life one of the most well known war stories by Stephen Ambrose and with the expertise of both Tom Hanks and Spielberg there was never any chance of error. This join venture between the american film super-giant HBO and the UK's very own BBC is able to take you back over 60 years in the past, a time time which only few remember, these memories have only now been brought to life.<br/><br/>Filmed in only a single town in the British countryside and a studio tucked away in a single corner of the world the special effects and design teams are able to take you through not only a story, but through the ever growing brotherhood that develops between soldiers during times of war.<br/><br/>I can honestly say that this mini-series has been rewarded with the very first 10/10 that I have ever been so stingy to reward. The cast of lesser-known actors and some British small time serial actors such as Damien Lewis and "SGT Tab" with the backing of the most costly television production of all time make this a one in a million film. The jewel in the crown that is modern television. I read the Stephen Ambrose book roughly 2 years before the mini-series came out.  I kept my HBO Subscription just to see this series.  The series faithfully stays to the way Dr. Ambrose presented the recollections of E Company men.  In this series you see everything.  Training, combat, comradeship.  It is hard to keep dry eyes watching events unfold: The relentless shelling in the Bois Jacques during the Battle of the Bulge, the chill of hearing anti-aircraft fire hitting the airplanes during the drop into Normandy, hearing the real veterans at the beginning of each episode. You cannot come away from this not feeling attached to these men.  I cannot praise this film enough. I've seen the whole ten part series three times now (which is a lot). The realism with which it is presented still brings tears to my eyes at certain points. This series is based very closely on real events. The interviews with the actual portrayed characters who lived the events will really hit home, and touch your heart. I've met quite a few WWII vets before, and they are some of the most interesting people alive today. This film will do it's best to show you what it was like for the people of the 101st. The DVD box set, in my opinion, is a must have. 10/10 BoB is a masterpiece.  Probably the best miniseries ever (if not then the award goes to Roots.)  Hits all the high points of Saving Private Ryan while avoiding the missteps, and also goes many steps further.  Acting, directing, script, score, effects all superb.<br/><br/>My personal favorite episodes were Pt2 (Day of Days), Pt7 (The Breaking Point) and Pt9 (Why We Fight).  Day of Days vividly demonstrates the fighting elan of the 101st, one of the finest combat units our country has ever fielded.  Breaking Point does a great job of outlining the difficulties and stresses of battlefield command, deliniating the difference between good and bad commanders, and also demonstrating the problems that happen when a good commander gets promoted (both for the commander and the unit.)  Why We Fight is emotionally devastating.  At the same time that it drives home the moral ambiguities and erosions that war imposes on all participants, it reminds us why some wars are morally imperative.<br/><br/>Watched this during the original HBO run (which had added poignancy as it happened to be broadcast right around 9/11.) Bought the DVD recently; it definitely holds up well under multiple viewings.  A must own. There are no word to describe how good this mini-series is. But I am going to try. The first time i saw this wonder of television, I was astonished. The second time I was speechless. And now when I am starting to grasp the idea that it was real people in those planes, those woods and under those circumstances.<br/><br/>If you ask the people of easy-company, if they were heros in the war, they will say no. But if you ask me, you will know that I canÂ´t stop thinking about what they did, and you will know that i think they are heros. So if you are thinking about getting another DVD for your collection, then you should buy this.<br/><br/>And by the way I gave it 10/10 The most realistic war-movie ever done. Sure, "Saving Private Ryan" is very good, but this is even better. All the characters, places, events...DAMN GOOD!!! And also, every episode "is" someones. Like, EPISODE 6 is the Medics episod, EPISODE 2 is D-Days episode, and so on...<br/><br/>*****/5 After having seen Band of Brothers, you only have one word in mind, Fantastic!<br/><br/>Even though Steven Spielberg does not direct any episodes, the acting and drama is paced every minute. Not one minute goes by with out you thinking that it all really happened.<br/><br/>I have purchased the DVD box with 6 dvd's to episodes on one disc and an extra with documentaries. The sound and picture is superb. The dynamic DTS track is amazing and actually shows of Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/>There is no explanation not to buy this dvd box, and get blown away! You know how you know when a show/movie is really good?  When it gets better the more you watch it.  I have watched BoB 4 times through.  It is simply outstanding.  In fact I would say you need to watch it more than once to really appreciate it, it also helps a great deal with keeping track of the different characters.  Personally, I don't think SPR holds a candle to BoB. I believe this show is so good because everyone involved wanted to tell the true story, and they did.  There was no reason to Hollywood it.  The story all by itself is enough. I once gave a semi-negative critical review of Spielberg's and Hanks' effort for Saving Private Ryan. They did just the opposite here and made something that should define the genre. Everything wrong with Ryan is right here. I think it would be a waste of the readers time to critique each episode, but there is so much uniformly great things here it's not hard to paint it with a broad brush.<br/><br/>First, the casting of mainly unknown actors is a terrific stroke of genius. We can easily buy them as soldiers. Their acting talent obviously got them the job but they ran with the ball and definitely scored a uniformly believable ensemble. The most well know is David Schwimmer who played the very unsympathetic part of Lt/Cpt Sobel. He played a great jerk though. I have been, known and worked with and among soldiers for over 35 years and am, in fact, sitting in the middle of an Armored Cav Regiment as I write this. These guys get it right. They give humanity, grit, courage and heart to the very real men they portrayed. It would be extremely hard to single out one single actor, but there are numerous gripping standouts; including: Damian Lewis as Lt/Maj Winters. His portrayal could be the definitive Army officer. A portrayal of a genuinely heroic and outstanding leader. I was disappointed as hell to learn he wasn't American but he did nothing to insult the role so I can forgive that. Donnie Wahlberg, probably the best known in the cast next to Schwimmer, was simply riveting as Carwood Lipton. There is a character I'd follow into battle myself. After him I most enjoyed Frank John Hughes as SSgt. William 'Wild Bill' Guarnere, Matthew Settle as Cpt Spiers, Ron Livingston as Lt/Cpt. Nixon, Michael Cudlitz as Bull Randleman, Eion Bailey as Webster, Richard Speight Jr. as Sgt Muck, Ross McCall as Liebgott, and Neal McDonough as Compton. The only complaint I have about any of the actors is the same one I have for all military movies: all of them are too old for the characters they play. Other than that, they did a magnificent job.<br/><br/>Now for the film itself. It is easy to see no effort was spared to achieve realism. The equipment, locations, sets, weapons, uniforms and every little detail seemed just right. Even the sound effects were better matched, especially concerning certain weapons that were known for certain sound signatures. I'd even expose my high and tight to acknowledge the outstanding efforts in art direction, costumes and sound.<br/><br/>The music score was perfect too. I loved how the score was used throughout.<br/><br/>I should give a special thanks to the Cinematography. The choice of the medium and especially the color values for the film was masterful. It was such a profound addition to the feel of it all I can barely express my gratitude for such a beautiful job.<br/><br/>It could almost pass unnoticed it was so perfectly executed, but the special effects and stunts were amazingly right on. I bought every minute of it. Superb, bravo!<br/><br/>Needless to say, I easily recommend this epic to everyone. I feel it is the best portrayal of war and the men in it that has ever seen film (or video as the case may be). I didn't, couldn't, see it in the original run on HBO, but I rented it the minute it hit DVD and have since bought the set. I love it unreservedly. Now all that's left is a nagging disappointment that there are so many other incredible stories not yet told that could all benefit from such a masterful portrayal. A definitive story of the American Air war over Europe, the Battle of Britain, the Marines in the Pacific in WWII (Flags of Our Fathers is perfect) or even such unheralded heroics as the brown water Navy's role in Viet Nam in PBR's. There are so many. Well Steve, you up to 1 or 2? This mini series helps to show the rest of our country what it takes for brave men to fight such a war. After reading the book by stephen ambrose and watching the mini series i was shocked to see what it was really like for them during the war and i can understand why easy men have always been there for each other. because they have lived through the worst type of warfare the world has ever seen. the men of easy company are my heros and they should have more recognition to what they did for their country then just a miniseries and a book. Cleverly weaving a story from actual events and people.  This series has enough dramatic content and plot devices to make you identify and warm to the characters and yet the overall effect is not to drown you in saccharine sweet caricatures.  Band of Brothers is a very powerful experience. Although I didn't catch Band of Brothers on HBO I did buy the series on DVD and watched every episode, each one making me wanting more. Band of Brothers told the story of Easy Company (US Airborne Paratroopers) and there missions through out WWII. This mini-series is full of great actors, and great storylines, by the end of it you will look at war in a whole new way. This story has changed my outlook on a lot of things, I would have to give this story 10 stars! This story deserved every award won! This is a must see for anyone that enjoys war movies, and well even if you don't I'm sure you'll change your mind after you watch this. Instantly I knew.<br/><br/>This DVD-box-series MUST be a part of my library.<br/><br/>As sure as other's "must's".<br/><br/>Get it. See it.<br/><br/>But remember, there where others fighting this war too. This is the, decisive, story of the US forces that saved Europe from total disaster! Something many europeeans today seem to have forgotten (I have not!). And you are still at it, thank's god! Why isn't this in the top 250? It has a 9.5 rating?<br/><br/>But anyway.... BoB is about Easy Company, 2nd Battalion, 506th Regiment during WWII. They were the best damn paratroopers around BoB chronicles their tour through Europe during WWII. From D-Day to Hitler's Eagles Nest, it gives every detail about the trials and errors they encountered.<br/><br/>First f you have to read the book. You know the characters much better if you read the book first. ALsoyou have to watch in more than once. The first time I saw it on HBO I was confused. I didn't realy know who the characters where are what they did. But then later I bought BoB and watched it again and got a whole lot more out of it. Then I read the book and it was amazing.<br/><br/>Overall this is a great mini-series. It combines the grittiness of Saving Private Ryan, with the turmoil of Apocalypse Now. Bottomline: Greatest Mini-Series ever. I have never felt so involved in any productoin as i have in this.  The character development was brilliant.  As a viewer it was easy to pick up on the emotion and the feelings within the company.  It left you under no illusions as to how hard the war was for everybody, from soldier to major. Everything from conditions they fought in to the emotions they felt was perfectly portrayed.  Though we can never understand the full horrors of WWII we get a glimpse of the suffering and hardships these heroes endured. It was a cinematic masterpiece. Band of Brothers is without a doubt the best thing ever put on film. It is easily the best war film ever because of the time it had to develop characters and show the characters in depth, rather than just having explosions and people dying like in other war movies. I cannot put into words how incredible of a mini-series Band of Brothers is. Every single actor is this film is absolutely perfect. I have watched the entire series on DVD over 6 times now and each time I enjoy it even more, if that is possible. The way all these heroic men are portrayed by these brilliant actors is just simply magificent. Seeing the incredible commradery between the soldiers of Easy Company and the real brotherhood is just the most enjoyable thing to watch. I am so glad that all those men who served for Easy Company are getting the respect they deserve through this great film.<br/><br/>Having seen that the IMDB peoples rating for this incredible film is an 8.2, I will end with a quote from good old Bill Guarnere- "That guys head is so far up his ass that lump in his throat is his own goddamn nose." 10 episodes of the most mesmerisingly presented television one could ever wish to see. A view of WW2 in Europe as seen through the eyes of the guys in Easy company, translated and put on the 16:9 screen by Spielberg/Hanks and the superb crews behind each episode.<br/><br/>Mindboggling.<br/><br/>TV4 in Sweden has just finished airing the series for the first time. I have sat, riveted, every Thursday evening, for the past 10 weeks.<br/><br/>I shall miss the production, but the last episode leaves nothing left to be desired in terms of tying all the loose ends.<br/><br/>Unforgettable.<br/><br/>/Soup What can you say about this Mini-Series but "Wow"!  From the same people who brought us "Saving Private Ryan" (Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks and others) but in my opinion did an even better job.  They really need to be congratulated to have taken on, as Eisenhower once said, "...a great and noble undertaking." I can't imagine how hard it was to take 10 different stories by several different directors and blend them seamlessly into one coherent story of a brotherhood of fighters brought together for war and permanently united because of it. The magic of the series is the truth that the producers and directors wished to convey over all else.  The series is so true to the real events.  Actors and Directors talked directly to the veterans who were THERE to get their feelings and thoughts which were more often than not, not what one would expect. Because of all this we get a straight forward no nonsense series that is more of documentary than a movie series.  Absolutely the best WW2 mini-series/movie/ documentary ever! A startlingly vivid, realistic (one would assume), compelling and highly moving account of WWII in Europe seen through the eyes of Easy Company, a US battalion of paratroopers. Far more than a mere battle actioner, the vicissitudes, psychological and physical effects of  war, the sheer human cost, are all portrayed here to unforgettable effect.<br/><br/>Well-filmed, well-acted - especially by Damian Lewis and Ron Livingston - though fine acting, excellent cinematography and battle choreography are all constantly on display. A must-see watch for anyone who may doubt that to never have seen action in war is a blessing indeed. I'd just like to state that this is NOT Saving Private Ryan the sequel - it's much better then that! I discovered Band of Brothers by chance a few weeks ago and since then I've had to resist the temptation to watch it again and again whenever I have spare time! My favorite film genre is War and has been for years and this spectacular series just tops everything i have experienced before. It slowly draws you into the thick of the gritty action and heartbreaking conflict, through the eyes of the brave young men of Easy Company, paratroopers in the 101st Airborne; throughout World War II. The memories of surviving veterans, both joyous and painful, are delivered to you by characters you grow to love and respect. And this is because you can feel their companionship and their respect for each other leaping off the screen. It has everything you want to see in an epic TV series like this one: sacrifice, black humor, graphic battle scenes, courage, joy-riding, shocks, tension and yes, even sex.<br/><br/>Overall, the cast is superb, despite lacking 'big' stars, and, perhaps unlike other large casts of soldiers, they are NOT apparent clones of each other. Before the fifth episode I was getting genuinely upset when one of these men were killed or wounded in action, and by the eighth even the beautifully done opening credits were getting me choked up. If you like war films and action with a real sense of the courage and spirit behind it then you have to see this! Come on girls, you too - even if only for the dozens of good-looking men! I say made for movie because the phrase made for tv might be construed as mediocre. But every episode of Band of Brothers would have been good in movie except nobody can sit for 10 hours. It is a more in-depth Saving Private Ryan. It is war up close and personal. Upon finishing what was probably the most accurate depection of the events of world war II, I wept. This mini series has all the right elements to tug at the heart strings. I felt like I knew the characters by the end of it all... and I gained a new respect for the veterans of WWII. This masterpiece gets my highest recommendation.If you are an american, you owe it to yourself to watch this. The only other word that comes to mind is "Breathtaking" I just bought the DVD and spent an entire day in front of my television set riveted by this masterpiece. I watched from beginning to end in one sitting. I could not stop. I plan on viewing the series again many times. These characters came to life for me instantly, and I was as I said before riveted.It was shot, written, and cast perfectly. Of course that's just my opinion, but I couldn't possibly be wrong. I have always held the deepest respect for the soldiers who fought in WWII to allow America to remain a free country.  In watching Band of Brothers, not only does the story reinforce such feelings of gratitude, respect, and admiration for these men, but the manner in which the movie plays out is as close that a viewer will *ever* SEE to knowing what these brave soldiers endured.<br/><br/>You want heroes?  The men and women who fought in this war, especially Easy Company -- these are true heroes.  You want a movie which depicts this better than any film ever before in the history of cinema -- Band of Brothers.<br/><br/>Band of Brothers is an epic film which, I truly hope, becomes integrated within the curriculum of every history course throughout every high school. Band of Brothers is certainly one of the best war movies I've ever seen and will probably remain so for a long time.<br/><br/>I'm happy most reviewers agree with me, but I feel compelled to speak out against the abundance of reviewers who write about the film being "American flag waving" or "anti German/British/etc". These comments make no particular sense to me. The story follows the history of only one unit- Easy Co. It isn't the story of Easy + the Germans or Easy + the British. So of course it is going to show an American point of view.<br/><br/>Many British reviewers point to one instance regarding a tank ambush in order to support their arguement. But thats just one small point which, I believe showcases the average GI's frustration with the British being slow and methodical, rightly or wrongly, from experiences in North Africa, Italy and before Caen. There will always be a bit of rivalry between allies and I doubt any two countries could have done as much together as Britain and the US did in WWII.<br/><br/>Every movie will have some sort of inherent bias because the story of any movie must follow people from some country or another. For the US see Patton/Black Hawk Down/The Big Red One/... For the Germans see Das Boot/Stalingrad/All Quiet on the Western Front/... For the British see Zulu/Bridge Over the River Kwai/Lawrence of Arabia/... For Australians see Gallipoli/ANZACs/The Light Horseman/... All these movies have a bias! That doesn't keep them from being excellence movies however.<br/><br/>For movies that show both sides in the most even-handed manner possible I'd suggest Tora Tora Tora, A Bridge Too Far and The Last Bullet. Enjoy. Band of Brothers rocks. The story is gritty, realistic and true to the facts. People have complained, saying the British were portrayed as bumbling idiots. Take the British tank commander, who is quoted on saying "if I caunt see him, i caunt bloody well shoot him." when Sgt. Martin confronts him about a German tank. He did not "ignore" Martin, he very simply could not see the tank, and didn't want to risk damaging property (the british were ordered minimal property damage). If you have any doubt about what you saw, read the Stephen Ambrose book. After i saw the movies on DVD, I read the book. The story-line is based on the book, and the book on research and interviews with Major Winters, Sergeant Malarkey, Rod Strohl and others. The uniforms, weapons and gear , the portrayal of Capt. Sobel, Lt. Dike's failure, etc... were all correct. See it. Feel what they felt. This show is sooooooo good. I love this show. It is the most heartfelt war drama since Saving Private Ryan. It is so realistic and so accurate that I recommend it to anyone with half a stomach, since some parts are quite bloody. But even so, it is well worth it. Best Miniseries ever. 10/10. WATCH IT NOW! GET THE DVD! What are you waiting for? This is the ultimate war story! As I said in the One line summary, this is the best Mini-series I have ever seen! Considering that I have seen more movies than someone that is 100 years old. (I am 25)  The production value alone is what will keep anyone's attention.  It also doesn't hurt that Tom Hanks, and Steven Spielberg are the exec. producers!  I also think that the one episode that featured Tom's son is not because it is his son, but the fact that he is going to be following in his fathers footsteps!  Overall it is great performances all around except for Ron Livingston, and Dale Dye, I have never heard or seen of any of the other actors.  I have to tell you they all held there own, and it is really made me feel for Easy company.  Well done all around, plus I have even more appreciation for the paratroopers that helped our country be what it is today.  Thanks to all the men who made out country what it is today.  I love you men.  <br/><br/>Shelman2392@aol.com This is the best piece of motion picture about WW2 I have ever seen! The realism, the characters, the sounds and moods... You feel like you ARE Maj. Winters in Normandie, or Cpl. Eugene Roe freezing his ass off in Bastogne. Part fiction and part documentary this must be THE most accurate tale of the 2. world war. A salute to those who fought, and those who fell.<br/><br/>The fact that each episode starts with a small monologue by some of the survivors from easy company makes the whole thing even more genius! You follow these men from D-day to the war ends, and before every episode you hear them tell about their experiences in their own words.<br/><br/>To Mr. Hanks & Mr. Spielberg: This time you did it!<br/><br/>11 Points! This series was extraordinarily well-done. I had read the book twice well before the series came out, and referred to it again after each episode. I have never seen anything so true to its source. A few compromises had to be made, of course; some incidents that involved company members NOT portrayed in the film were reassigned to other men (understandable, since there's only so many men that can be portrayed.) But I don't believe that there was a single "composite character" in the Easy Company portrayals, and what minor dramatic licenses were taken were almost universally reasonable. The acting was good to superb throughout; even David Schwimmer (one of the least airborne-like people I can imagine) turned in an effective portrayal of Herbert Sobel. The battle sequences were outstanding, in the tradition of (albeit on a smaller budget than) Saving Private Ryan (and without the glaring weak points of that film.) In fact, SPR, BOB, and Blackhawk Down have so raised the bar for portrayal of modern combat on film that any other films, regardless of how well-done, pale in comparison. My favorite of the episodes was Episode 7, "Breaking Point." It had a great main plot-line (the disastrous Lieutenant Dike), some of the best dialog of the whole series (several of the foxhole conversations, plus the discussion between Lipton and Speirs about the latter's reputation), and some of the toughest casualties (Guarnere and Toye.) Episode 5, "Crossroads," is another favorite, even though it's a bit "artsy." Winters' unexpectedly facing down an entire German company on the dike, plus the almost haphazard deployment to Bastogne, stand out (and the best line of the series is Winters' response to the truck driver who tells him they're surrounded.) Episode 6, focusing on medic Eugene Roe during the siege of Bastogne, is another top one. And the dramatization of the death camp in Episode 9, even though this sort of thing has been portrayed innumerable times, had a great deal of emotional power to it. Singling out these installments is not intended as a disservice to the others; they were ALL great! Now that it's out on DVD I will finally be buying a player. I won't go into details, because words can't describe the kind of emotions this series will wrench from your soul.  The series is definitely something that must be experienced to understand.<br/><br/>I am aware that after watching this movie I still have no clue what it must have been like experiencing such terrifying situations as the Battle of the Bulge, and if you watch actual footage of what occurred at Bastogne (which was by far my favorite of the series) you still can't imagine what it was like.  <br/><br/>But just the mere fact that the director came this close to capturing what it felt, and that the surviving members of Easy Company had an opportunity to speak to such a large audience makes this one of the best (if not the best) series I've ever seen, and I will be lucky if I ever see something so potent as Band of Brothers in my lifetime. If you compiled a list of the greatest mini series of all time, can you name one tht would come ahead of this one. I first heard about this production during the summer of 2000, and I waited for the mini series to finally ai with great expectations.  All my expectations were met.<br/><br/>The series has a large cast, filled with mostly no name actors. But I think that works for it. In a series like this, it helps to have a large cast. First off, you really get to see the connection between these men, all of whom would die for the others. That kind of bond can't really be illustrated by focusing on just a few guys. And it's no name actors are all benefiting big time from this. Damian Lewis, the Brit who played Major Winters, is starring in the Stephen King movie "Dream Catcher" with Morgan Freeman and "Band" co-star Donnie Wahlberg (whose performance in this and a great one scene in "The Sixth Sense" atones for his time as a New Kid). Wahlberg also stars in the new NBC cop drama "Boomtown" with fellow "Brother" Neil McDonough. And Ron Livingston was already the man for starring in "Office Space" and having a role in "Swingers."<br/><br/>This show was fantastic from part 1 through part 10. I felt it everytime one of the men died. And I was very happy for all the men who lived. That's made all the more remarkable by the fact that all these events did happen. Kudos to the men of Easy Company for helping to win the War and sacrificing so many for that effort. And kudos to the men who played the men, for they did an amazing job bringing those events to generations too young to have felt them in 1944.<br/><br/>Ten out of Ten. Anybody disagree? I wish it was a movie so it could have won an Academy Award, but it was a mini-series, so it could never win an Academy Award.<br/><br/> I love this mini-series. I also loved "Saving Private Ryan" which is very similar to it in many aspects. I watched it very intently last year when it originally was broadcasted on HBO.<br/><br/>I thought it was very well-written, and directed. And it is was also visually stunning. I thought that the cast was perfect for their roles. Although that many of the actors were not very well known, I keet thinking that I had seen them in many things before. A large part of the cast was British, and I was impressed by their American accents which were, for the most part, flawless.<br/><br/>I think that all of it's greatness is due to Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks. I can not wait for it to come out on DVD. only television could have done this justice.....ranks up there for me as one of the finest televsion programmes ever made along with i claudius, the world at war and edge of darkness.<br/><br/>utterly superb I believe that it provided the most realistic views of World War II that has ever been produced.  Despite the graphic depicition of the war, this miniseries should be required viewing for all high school students -- especially as we continue to lose vetrans, and their first-hand stories of WWII, at an increasing rate.  The episode where Easy Company finds the remnants of a concentration camp is, in its own way, as powerful as Schindler's List. Well, if you only saw this mini-series just for the action, let me just say that you were wrong for doing that. This Movie was dedicated to the war heroes of WWII. When I saw it, I was literally driven to tears, and I am glad that the creators were so accurate with the events in general (ex: Out-of-the-question and pointless computer effects and what not). This movie was perfect in every way, I want to buy it for me and my friends. Band of brothers is the mosr realistic Series/film I have ever seen. The most positive thing is that all its parts, is produced like a real Hollywood movie. Also, that you remember all the characters, from each part of the series. Garniere, Winters etc. In few words, Band of Brothers is the most beautyfull series ever made! I never tire of playing the 10 episodes of "Band of Brothers" that I recorded last fall when it aired on HBO. After a few episodes, I became familiar with all of the principal soldiers as well as the actors who played them. (IMDb was most helpful in providing cast lists.)  I believe BOB is clearly the best mini-series we have ever been privileged to enjoy on television, and HBO deserves high praise for this excellent production.  I look forward to buying the series as a boxed set if and when it becomes available. This has to be one of the greatest mini-series ever made.  It follows a company through their experiences in WWII.  The best part about it is that it is almost considered a documentary as it is based on a true story.  The people behind it went through years of research for it.  One warning though: if you are queasy, don't watch this.  This is up there with Saving Private Ryan's opening scene with graphicness, and it is all the way through.  If you dont mind graphic violence though, this is a great mini series that i will certainly buy the boxed set of when it comes out in November. A little hard to get through some of the violent scenes - but worth it. Should be required viewing for the kids who might easily forget "the Greatest Generation" and what they did for us. Let's not let their sacrifices ever prove wasted. This show is by far the best mini-series I've seen in ages. In fact, EVER! Although I haven't actually been there or seen the action myself some 50 years ago, I'd say that Band of Brothers is WW2 in a nutshell. Everything is present; comaradery, boot-camp, action, reflections on the war's influence on the soldiers, the hazzle of combat and the long waits where nothing happens (but it doesn't get boring when you watch it), and lots more. Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg really outdid themselves with this. In my humble opinion anyway. :)<br/><br/>If you liked movies like Saving Private Ryan or The Thin Red Line you're gonna LOVE this! And you'll recognize a lot of the camera movements and effects of such movies (e.g. the screen rumbles when a grenade explodes closeby to give a better effect of the blast).<br/><br/>Enough said. Why haven't YOU seen this show yet?! Go on, find it somewhere and watch it! I promise YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!! Well, I cannot more than agree with most of the other comments here.<br/><br/>These series have been amazing, and I think there is one main reason for it which is hard to describe but I am sure you know what I mean when I say this series have "that feeling". Yes that's right, that feeling you only get after seeing a great movie, which is a feeling that wont go away just because the credits have rolled. With Band of Brothers you get that feeling after every one of the 10 episodes.<br/><br/>The series have one negative side though, or maybe it is what makes it good? I don't know, but as someone else mentioned too, its quite hard to figure out and recognize all characters especially since they are mostly played by rather unknown, but great, actors. Of course the amount of different characters and the fact that they all got the same uniform and the same sort of mud and dirt in their faces doesn't make it easier now does it. I think it took until about 6 or 7 episodes until I could recognize most of the main characters. Still I don't know if this is bad? maybe? Even if it is a bit annoying in the beginning I don't care, its great anyway!<br/><br/>Talking about the episodes, some are better than others of course, (but all are great). I really liked the ones i Bastogne in the winter, I think its 6 and 7. The two final episodes are excellent as well.<br/><br/>The idea with different directors is good, you'll never know what to expect from each episode. Also the way they focus on different characters in different episodes is good, even though its a 10 hour long movie in whole, you can watch each episode as one single movie, complete with ending - of some sort.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, since Spielberg (even though he made a lot of great movies) is involved, the series does not suffer from the Hollywood syndrome - the usual over-dramatic and glorifying parts (read Pearl Harbor). The main thing that makes Band of Brothers this good is the genuine authentic feel through out the whole series.<br/><br/>Great work, one of my few "10" votes! I saw the final episode of this show a couple of weeks ago and am still thinking about it. I thought it was excellent, wonderfully filmed, acted and scripted. It really gave the viewer a glimpse of what war really was, without resorting to the usual clichés. I watched the show faithfully every weekend, however I did miss episode six. I thought it really began to pick up at about episode five, it was good before that but by then I was beginning to recognise and remember the characters from episode to episode. While I feel all the actors were great, my favourite character was Guarnere, I thought he was funny and very brave, Frank John Hughes acted him brilliantly. Other characters that stood out to me were; Liebgott, Webster, Luz, Malarkey, Toye, Compton, Perconte and Shifty, though they were all great. I've read the book too and I think the series did justice to it and to all the men of Easy company and WW2. A fabulous series that deserves awards for acting, writing, directing, costumes, etc. for ten weeks i found myself glued to the screen. the special effects were amazing and the drama of easy company was re-lived in such a fantastic way.The performance of every actor involved was just excellent and Damian Lewis was a joy to watch. I am doing G.C.S.E history at my high school and Band of Brothers has been the talk of the class for many weeks.i hope the bbc will show it again or that it's released on video. well done xxxxxxxx ps i luv damian lewis and eion baileyxxx I'll admit that I HATE war films, programs, anything like that. Dambusters, Battle of Britain, bores me to tears. My dad and younger brother love them though. I walked in the lounge one day and "Band of Brothers" was on. I sat down and watched a little bit of it. Well, the little bit turned in to the whole of the episode. This mini series is absolutely fantastic, accurate, and conveys emotions fantastically. I especially enjoyed watching James Madio in his new role as Sergeant Frank Perconte, who previously I'd only known for his role in "USA High". Just goes to show what a diverse actor he is, his performance was excellent! :) excellent show the best anything ive ever seen...im happy that i taped them all with no ads i have seen all ten episodes ...my favourite 2 were probably 6-7 the snow ones...thought the last one was excellent as well.....highly recommended i cant wait for the release to video and DVD in 2002 i have to say that i have not seen a better drama series either english or american that can emulate what i have seen for the last ten weeks over here. after having heard about this series trying to better the efforts of saving private ryan i was not entirely sure that this could be done over a no. of weeks. how wrong could i have been? very very wrong. the acting was outstanding. direction simply breathtaking. i do have to say well done to damien lewis (as he is english). i have seen him in a number of programmes over here previously, nothing though that could better show how a good an actor he is. is this the best mini-series ever? i love my tv and films and i have to put band of brothers right up at the top.(sopranos a close second, but thats another story)<br/><br/>well done to all involved in the making.do you think they will find time do another series about a group of heroes who served their country with pride and honour. i do hope so Band of Brothers is in my oppinion absolutely the best TV-series ever made. This unique series provide it´s viewer with a fisthand insight into the world as as an american paratrooper during WWII. Based on the true story, it´s realism is astunning, and each episode is like being thrown in right by the soldiers side in the intence and horrofying situations. The extreame realism combined with firstclass acting, accurate coreography and locations, make this series a true work of art, and an absolute "must see" for anybody with even just a remote interrest of WWII, or real life drama in general. Having seen Band of Brothers on BBC television,I am convinced that is by far one of the best television series ever. I am very interested in World War 2 history and when you watch this,you feel that history is shown as accurate as possible.This series,based on the book by Stephen Ambrose,which should be read in addition to watching the series,is brilliant. When you watch Band of Brothers,you are watching a series,that gives you an impression of what it must have been like for the soldiers,fighting in World War 2.The actors are all giving an excellent performance,in all of the 10 episodes,you are impressed by them. Als very important is the fact that the whole period is portrayed,as far as I can judge,very accurate.The uniforms,the weapons,vehicles,tanks,it feels as if you are transported back in time. Being from the Netherlands,I was very interested in the episodes about Easy company's fight in operation Market-Garden.The two episodes,give a very good impression about the fighting in Holland. Well I advise everyone interested in World War 2,to watch this series,because it is one of the best series or films ever made about the war.Watch it after you watch "Saving Private Ryan",although "Ryan" is a brilliant film,Band of Brothers is far better,because of the history and the feeling you get for the men of Easy-company. I also recommend the book by Stephen Ambrose and the book David Webster wrote about his experiences as a paratrooper in Easy company. The first episode from the epic collaboration of Hanks/Spielberg was everything I expected. The character build up and story line gave me a view that I have always wanted to see in the WWII movies.  Everything from the authentic uniforms and jargon to the actual preparation and build up for D-DAY was superb. The passion that Hanks and Spielberg have for authenticity is quite evident in every aspect from the opening sequence on. The interview of the actual "Band Of Brothers" in between parts I and II gave this a very "documentary" (ala History Channel) feel and added another dimension to the series that I like. I think that of all the WWII movies and documentaries I have seen are rolled up into this mini series. I thought Sundays were just looked forward to for FOOTBALL. Band of Brothers is the "SUPERBOWL" of mini series and they probably will keep scoring with drama and excitement till the final episode. My thanks to Hanks/Spielberg for giving us a bit of history and more understanding of WWII with each episode and in the same token HONOR all the men who fought in WWII for this great country. I hope everyone enjoys this as much as I have. The best program in the history of television. I have watched with all 10 episodes of this fantastic mini-series. The realism of the battle scenes fill me with horror, and go a small way to help me understand what the brave allied soldiers went through in WW2. These men were exceptional (as were all who served). Thanks for a masterpiece. I've watched this series 6 or 7 times in its entirety, and I can only say that it gets better and better upon repeated viewings. It's not just the incredibly done combat footage, it's the incredible attention to detail and story on both the part of the cast and crew, and the honor paid to the men of the second World War.<br/><br/>To see what my father and mother (a combat nurse in WWII) went through is amazing. To see what these men, (and women) under the most adverse of conditions, went through, and still did what they had to do is simply (in the true sense of the word) awesome.<br/><br/>Does it have its flaws? Decidedly so. There are several of the same buildings that are supposed to be in different towns in different episodes, that are recognizeable; There are plot holes - e.g. "Wild Bill" Guarnere showing back up in episode 5 after being wounded, with no explanation; Sobel threatening Malarkey over the motorcycle, and nothing comes of it, etc - and several others, but taken as a whole, there is simply NOTHING than can compare with this movie. For drama, ethos, pathos, a testament to the human spirit, this will astound.<br/><br/>On a different note, taking into account the fabulous combat scenes shot, this movie has paled all other action movies for me. The randomness of death, the intensity of the battles, the "look" of the scenes have made everything else seem cartoonish. To whit: The scene in episode 3 where the American soldier shoots the German coming out of the just-bakooka'd buidling with his 1911 .45: If you pause the movie at that moment it could be a picture out of Life Magazine in the '40's. Even SPR does not do it for me anymore because that was fiction. This is truth. These things happened to these men, and on a grander scale, happened to millions of others: Anyone that has been in war will be affected by this movie.<br/><br/>Some of my favorite parts are when the story shows the soldiers as human. The looting, the disgust with the higher ups, the hatred for the Germans, these are what made it real.<br/><br/>Many are now claiming that we have too much WWII stuff happening. I say: "Pshaw!" Let's have more of it. Let us never forget how Americans (and other residents of this planet) fought, died, survived, and went on. Let us be constantly reminded so as to not get complacent in our lives so that anything like this might ever happen again.<br/><br/>Highest kudos to Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg and HBO. The first 10 I've ever given any movie on this site. Without going in to a long drawn out synopsis, this quite simply in my opinion is : The best TV film ever, if not one of the best things to appear on TV of all time. The acting, filming and true story are all just stunning. I cannot wait for this to get a DVD release. How anyone, even if they hate WW2 subject matter can vote this any less than 7 or 8 is beyond me, it oozes class throughout and is a credit to the film makers and most of all the real people who fought for the Allied nations in the war. Having read the book I know just how closely the film follows the true story. The performances and direction are magnificent. The story is one, not merely of war and action but of the human spirit, of friendship and of admirable leadership.I admire the story and the men who lived it and those who made it. Brilliant! (One minor observation - the steps to Eva Braun's room at the Eagle's Nest go down and not up). There have been so many superlatives hurled at this series (and a few misguided or uninformed detracting remarks) that it's probably pointless to state the obvious one more time, but two days after viewing the final episode and thinking about little else but BoB since then, I can only say that it is one of the most powerful pieces of television I have ever seen.<br/><br/>It is not simply a son of Private Ryan project: Brothers, without belittling the achievement of that movie, expands on and enhances the WWII experience as seen from the point of view of the ordinary foot soldier. Rooted firmly in fact, the series, with it's incredible writing, directing and spectacular production values, takes on a life of it's own once the final images fade away. By the end, you are left wondering more about these men, how they adapted to civilian life, how, after sharing the camaraderie in conflict that they did, were they able to go home and continue their lives and return to some sense of normality under the shadow of everything they had witnessed and done. There is no cosy conclusion to BoB, no sense of completion (and some have been annoyed by this), but I feel that this is the proper way to end the story: sure, you want to know more, but the fact that you are grateful for men like Winters, Nixon, Lipton, Roe, Randlemann et al, and comforted that someone like that can go through hell for everything that you take for granted, only adds to the undiluted realism that Brothers strived for and achieved so stunningly.<br/><br/>As for the acting, it's already understood that Damian Lewis, Ron Livingston, Donnie Wahlberg, and so on deserve all the plaudits that have been bestowed on them, but for me there is a trio of actors who have not been mentioned enough and deserve a substantial share of the plaudits. Shane Taylor as Doc Eugene Roe can muster a response from the viewer with just a glance: his pain and anxiety, as well as his determination and sympathy for his fellows was illustrated beautifully by this incredible actor who does not need dialogue to stamp his authority on a scene; Michael Cudlitz as Sgt "Bull" Randlemann was just as incredible, making the most of the episode that focussed on his character's plight behind enemy lines (Replacements), and exuding the firm and steady nature that instilled the confidence which those in his charge must have shared: this character could have descended into sheer war movie stereotype of the big sergeant with the chomped cigar, but Cudlitz's quiet but authoritative presence throughout all 10 episodes marks him as an actor to watch for in the future; and Dexter Fletcher as Sgt Martin provided another rock for the other characters to play off: I've been aware of Fletcher since Bugsy Malone through Press Gang, The Rachel Papers and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, but here, more than anywhere before, does he demonstrate his versatility and effortless ability as an actor and propels himself into the ranks of Britain's finest performers. Singling out these three actors is not meant, in any way, to diminish the other performances (the acting throughout was faultless - and I normally hate David Scwimmer!), but these three are, hopefully, an indication of the wealth of new and upcoming talent out there that it would be a crime not to see more of in the very near future.<br/><br/>Finally, in a year that produced the frankly risible and obnoxious Pearl Harbor, it is good to know that there is a willingness for production companies to make, and audiences to watch, an intelligent and passionate take on the 20th Century's most obvious historical touchstone. There may be other war movies and shows to come, but they would need to be very good indeed to match the achievement of Band of Brothers. It is, in short, an unqualified masterpiece.<br/><br/>10 / 10 I felt that i couldn't really comment until i had witnessed all of the series, now i have i am moved by the performances by the actors ranging from (Richard Winters-Damian Lewis to Private Hall-Andrew Scott). A huge congratulations to Spielberg and Hanks for making this amazing series, bringing the reality of war to life for the veterans of Easy Company. Through the use of focusing on one character of the series each episode to narrate the story to us, we find out more about them Are they afraid? Do they have no mercy? (Not in Spears case!!).<br/><br/>And that they are caught up in the middle of a battleground where anything goes. I really liked the beginning of 'Crossroads', the way in which the beginning reflected on the ending this is just Hanks genius!. 'Why we fight' was moving to watch,as seeing all the Jews in the death camp brought home the true meaning of war, and why we must prevent it.<br/><br/>I just want to say a big thank you to HBO and all those associated with making Band of Brothers for making this series possible because it has changed my whole prospective view on war and its consequences. Everyone who starred in the series where excellent , No dodgy performances!!. And Mr Damian lewis deserves a 10 out of 10 for his brilliant contribution towards this masterpiece i have been so proud to comment on!! A THRILLING BUT MOVING EXPERIENCE. HBO, in my opinion, is the ONLY network with the guts to bring us something this big, and important. The network has never ceased to produce very high quality works with High caliber producers, directors, writers, and actors. I am impressed, once again! The beginnings of the series' with the actual men of E company, bring to the story, a reality. These were Real people! It is an honor for me, a person of another generation to be allowed to see what these men went through, and why they went through it. The writers, producers, directors, and especially the actors should be very proud of this groundbreaking series. And a special thank you to the men of Easy company. Aaron Byrd Kansas City Mo. Band of Brothers is an amazing compilation of reasons to be thankful for all that we have.  The young men that served in Easy Company symbolize everything that is good about the people that share the label of Americans. Through the daily grind of life people forget what sacrifices a generation made so that we can call ourselves free.  Thank you to Mr. Hanks and Mr. Speilberg for putting that story on film for us to view.  Thank you to Dr. Ambrose for uncovering this story and committing it to paper so that it can be retold.  And most of all, thank you to the veterans dead or alive, wounded or unscathed.  You have the thanks of the nation. I cannot believe how good of a series this was.  I missed a few episodes unfortunately, but I still loved the show.  All of the actors delivered so well, and the direction of it was excellent.  Of course, i expect nothing less of Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg.  I cannot wait for the series to come out on DVD or video.  I will definetly be one of the first in line at the register.  If you know when this comes out for sale, drop me a line please.  Damian Lewis gave such a strong performance as Major Winters and I have to admit that I've got a huge crush on him now because of this series! I've looked all over for websites on him, but I guess he's not all that well known...until now. "Band of Brothers" deserves all of the awards that it can get.  I really don't think that I can put into words the effect this has had on so many people.  I read that when Tom and Steven saw the actual Band of Brothers, they asked for their autographs, so you can see how important these men are.  What a great depiction of war.  This series has got my vote. 10 10 10 10 10!  If you ever want to chat about this great show, just email me or find me on MSN Messenger.  Ciao! The best mini-series in the history of television.  Like war, and unlike other television series the viewer does not know who will survive and who will not.  If you are an American, it must make you proud.  If you are not, you must admire the sacrifice. "We few, we happy few, we band of brothers. For he today that sheds his blood with me Shall be my brother"<br/><br/>Its not often that a movie - TV or Cinema, illicits the types of reactions that have been seen as a result of this production.  Not fiction, but history, we see a glimpse of what the brave souls in Easy Company had to face.  Our generation cannot comprehend the type of combat, brutality and terror that those men, crouched down in foxholes outside Fey, parachuting over Normandy and Holland, and surrounded at Bastogne had to face.<br/><br/>
I've seen people who haven't cared for history or "war-movies" become absolutely riveted to the screen these past 11 Sundays.  Tears welling in their eyes, they all remark how absolutely extraordinary those men were.. those Citizen Soldiers who went off to expel fascism and evil, and paid the ultimate price...<br/><br/>The cast was fantastic:  virtual unknowns giving the performances of their lives in one of the most amazing television events.  Whatever praise and fortune comes from their efforts, they've earned it. A true and heroic story. Buying and reading the book makes the experience much more complete. As many have asked.....when is it coming out on DVD!!!!???? To get the nuances it helps greatly to see it several times. The 10 hour production surpasses almost all movies in quality of presentation. Watch it in a movie theater like environment. Lights off, Big screen, surround sound on and loud. No interruptions. Phone unplugged. Pets and children fed and taken care of. Turn up the a/c during the Bastogne episodes ; - )<br/><br/>
Whew!<br/><br/>Bullets and tracers "whizzing" by your ears. The you are there moving photography.<br/><br/>Hats off to Hanks, Spielberg the writers and the talented actors.<br/><br/>Damien Lewis (Winters) is a fine centerpiece. Elon Baily as Pvt. Webster plays the role perfectly. Dale Dye of course nails the grizzled combat officer role (Col. Sink) The finest acting is Ron Livingston as the genius yet flawed (and VERY alchoholic) Lewis Nixon. From crazed booze searches to "advice" in army administration Captain Nixon's facial gestures speak volumes.<br/><br/>
As a history buff the realism and accuracy is terrific. As a "story" the real truth is stronger then any fiction could be.<br/><br/>
A must (and right now a difficult) see.<br/><br/>If they had 11 stars I'd give it 12 This sery is good, really good. Sometimes it's even better than the<br/><br/>movie. Why it is so good? 1: The acting is good. They are playing in a good natural way. 2: The story is authentic.That's much better than the a little bit<br/><br/>unrealistic story in the movie. 3: The way of filming is a thing what I much like. The green, brown<br/><br/>and colors and the way it looks like the cameraman is really in a<br/><br/>war zone is what I like. 4: The action scene's are realistic. Not every shot of a good guy is<br/><br/>a hit and the wounded men are wounded if it looks they are really<br/><br/>wounded. And those scenes aren't censored, which I rather prefer.<br/><br/>And the amount of action is in a good proportion. 5: The way of interacting between the good and the bad guys is<br/><br/>good. The germans aren't just the evil bad bullies but also normal<br/><br/>soldiers who are rather at home than at the front. And the<br/><br/>Americans aren't just the hero's who save the world if it is nothing,<br/><br/>but sometimes also cruel against the enemy. 6: And finally, the language is authentic. And that's funny for me,<br/><br/>because when the soldiers are in the Netherlands. The people are<br/><br/>really speaking Dutch. I don't know if  the people in America can<br/><br/>understand what they are saying, but I can tell you, that what they<br/><br/>are saying, is not just blabbering something stupid, but they have<br/><br/>normal lines what fits in the serie. A good example in the serie is when a soldiers is in a barn in<br/><br/>Nuenen. There is an old fat man helping him. That person is a<br/><br/>famous dutch actor in the Netherlands, named Jack Wouterse. Those things let you see that Tom Hanks an Stephen Spielberg<br/><br/>made a very good quality product for t.v. I give this serie a 10. Dr. Ambrose, the professional historian, striving for balance, goes out of his way to understand the most hated man in E-Company, Herbert Sobel. He states repeatedly in the book: "Herbert Sobel made Easy Company". David Schwimmer, the most well-known actor in Band of Brothers, put all of his acting ability into this complex man. How easy it would have been for the star Schwimmer to play the heroic avenging Jewish GI, Liebgott. The biggest acting challenge in Band of Brothers was playing Herbert Sobel, and I admire David Schwimmer's courage to take on this role, and play it to the hilt. If the story of Herbert Sobel was not told, we could never really appreciate Easy Company. This is the way Saving Private Ryan should have been: great story,special effects and characters are perfect.It really gives you the feeling of having taken part in the whole campaign, with all the hardships and the incredible friendship these fine soldiers developed. A plus is that the Germans very not portrayed in a demeaning way. All in all a great mini series. I will sorely miss Richard Winters, Eugene "Doc" Roe, Lewis Nixon and Carwood Lipton.  Damian Lewis was superb as Major Winters and my hat off to Shane Taylor as Eugene Roe.<br/><br/>This series just got better with each episode and I hated to see #10 end. It left me breathless to say the least.<br/><br/>Thank God we had men like them and Thank God we still do!!! I've never been "pulled" into a mini-series, or movie, quite the same way as I was by "Band Of Brothers". Having read most of Dr. Ambrose's books, I was prepared for an excellent mini-series.  I was not prepared for the emotional roller coaster as the story proceeded.  From reading his other books, I knew that some of these men would die, or suffer horrible wounds.  But, the manner in which death and wounds came, almost at random, mostly by artillery and mortars, brought a realism not found in movies. While "Saving Private Ryan" was a good "yarn", this mini-series is unsurpassed. With the exception of having seen David Schwimmer before, all these actors were unknown to me, and that's what made it so believable.<br/><br/>The humanity and care shown by Major Winters for his men, just prior to pulling them out of the line in France, was nothing short of noble.<br/><br/>
The last episode couldn't have been done better. The final speech by the German general certainly was a great way to end things, and truly show what a band of brothers really was.<br/><br/>The "Greatest Generation" certainly deserves the title. I was broken-up for 10 full minutes after the last episode aired. Stunning.<br/><br/>I have read much of Ambrose's work, and though he can be overdramatic at times, this story deserves every accolade it receives.<br/><br/>To Richards Winters, Carwood Lipton and the other members of the 101, I hope to meet them one day and say 'thank you' Sometimes, you fight to hold back your tears. And it's even harder when you know it's not all fiction and you can find it written in our history books. These were all ordinary men, shaped and harden by the trials of war, and I think this mini-series is truly a testament to that. You feel like you know these men, and you feel with them when they loose their mates in the struggles of war. You somehow mourn with them. Prepare to be enlightened by the trials of war. A great series.  One of the best true stories I've ever seen done on film. Exceptional acting is its strongest point, but I thought the writing and directing were very good as well.  At times funny, frightening, and moving, it is a unique viewing experience.  I loved it. Before tonight, the greatest film tribute to the men who won World War II was Sam Fuller's "The Big Red One".  Without in any way diminishing the value of that film, this is even greater.  As one of the veterans of the unit says in the prologue, they didn't do it for the medals or accolades, they did it because "it's what had to be done".<br/><br/>Anyone who has any appreciation of the freedom we have today must thank Stephen Ambrose, Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg, HBO and the hundreds of others involved for this tribute to those who made it possible.  Without even taking into account the remaining 8 episodes, this is great filmmaking.<br/><br/>It is only too bad that it won't be eligible for the Best Picture Oscar! It's not TV, it's HBO. Band of Brothers is a true epic, in every sense of the word. HBO has yet again shown its amazing ability to create dramatic cinema, and to go where the networks can't. In this ten part miniseries, we follow the men of Easy Company from their training, all the way up until the end of the war. Each man has his own character development, and the focus is constantly shifting, to play out the story of WWII through the eyes of each soldier. Each episode is beatifully shot, with a very subdued feel. The combat scenes are excellent, of course, and they do not as merely a showcase for special effects and explosions, but as another medium in which the plot character development can be advanced. During a battle, we may be treated to a scene of a soldier aside, and be shown his own, personal struggle within the greater conflict. The series, being based on a book chronicling the real-life saga of the men of Easy Company, is always set firmly in realism, without fabricated dramatics. The realism is supported before each episode, where the real men of Easy Company, now aged, present their own real-life accounts. They tell the story just as well as the film does, and are a special treat to watch. I recommend this series to anyone who has ever wondered, and asked the question: "What was it really like?" This film gives the answer, and so much more, and does it in exactly the right way.<br/><br/>Band of Brothers gets a 10 out of 10, and a place in my heart. When Saving Privet Ryan came to theaters few years ago I went to see it and I felt like I was taking part in the world war now seeing this series it reminds me of Saving Private Ryan. This is great series is well written, played and directed and I highly recommend that you see it. This is MUST see for every war film fans. RATE = 10/10. This movie is probably about as close as one can get to experiencing and understanding war from an infantry man's perspective without having to actually be shot or fired upon.  I look forward to the next installment of the series to see what aspect of WWII will be examined.  The characters are amazing. Hi there, I'm in the UK and we've just seen episode 5 , "Crossroads", where the lead guy starts getting flashbacks in the Paris Metro.  Man - what a totally moving episode. Here's a guy, who's leading his men cold-heartedly, but compassionately into combat in previous episodes, without losing his cool - and now we start to feel what is ticking under his skin, in a small way. I won't give any spoilers, but it was very well done. Overall, the series has had me rivetted to my seat - and I REALLY mean rivetted. This is simply the best bit of TV to come out of America since the original X-Files series.Remember that? - when that series was new, original and you couldnt wait to see what would happen to Scully and Mulder next week - well, this is the same kind of feeling. Somehow, the filmmakers get you INTO the minds of the characters in an incredible way. Maybe its the way they film it, or the dialogue, but it works. Ok, there's violence along the way, but it's incredibly realistic - and like real war, it's over in a flash. Most episodes that I have seen have very punchy violence , compressed into roughly 15 minutes in total, with the rest taking up the development of the characters. I think this is a very good move on the part of the producers. They could have gone for the all out gore-fest of many action films, which IS unrealistic.<br/><br/>Life for a soldier IS normality, mixed with short sharp minutes of intense combat - and this series goes a long way to , at least, convey that sense of it. <br/><br/>I wont ramble on any more - but needless to say, this is an intensely interesting and educating series. It is NOT entertainment. If you are expecting gung-ho Rambo stuff, look elsewhere.<br/><br/>And you know what... what is amazing about how this was produced, is that i dont even know, after 5 episodes, what the lead commander's name is. All i know is the face.<br/><br/>And thats all a grunt in his command would probably know - especially if he was a fresh 17 year old.<br/><br/>Something tells me , that this has been done on purpose - to convery that sense of what a 17 year rookie feels. <br/><br/>Amazingly subtle, and amazing filming.<br/><br/>And it's brought a lot of tears to my eyes. <br/><br/>I'll shut up now - all i can say, in light of our boys going into combat at this present time, is just to watch it, and remember what we are fighting for right now. The guys in this film, albeit 60 or so years ago, were fighting for the same thing - freedom.<br/><br/>Keep the flag flying America.<br/><br/>All the best,<br/><br/>someone in England. I have been transfixed by the TV for an hour each Sunday this fall.  Band of Brothers is, quite possibly, the best war film ever made.  It isn't schmaltzy but gritty, not melodramatic but real- taking you from funny to sad to horrified in a matter of minutes.  Likewise, the cast is made up of real people- actors you've seen a million times before in bit roles, in the roles of their lives.  They play their characters so dead on, so well, that you really believe that this is how it was during WWII.<br/><br/>I was particularly impressed by Shane Taylor, who portrays medic Eugene Roe. His quiet desperation, anger, and resignation over his dead and the wounded charges was, to be sure, one of the best portrayals I have ever seen.  I think I cried at many points throughout Episode Six.  He certainly deserves an award, as does this entire series and cast.<br/><br/>I cannot wait to see what comes next. Gifted-true tail of citizen heroes during WWll.  With our men in harm's way, this is  a wonderfully timed and realistic presentation of an airborne unit from training through the war. wed Band Of Brothers is easily the best look at the career of a World War II soldier to have been portrayed on the screen. Nobody can say that this series glamorizes war. War sucks, and these soldiers know it. Men shot don't slump to the ground, give out an inspirational speech, and expire. They scream, plead for help, and writhe in pain. At some points in this series I had to look away from the screen to spare myself some of the violence. Overly gory? Certainly not. They were shooting for realism, and they got it.<br/><br/>Watching this series with surround sound is truly impressive. You can hear the buzz of bullets shooting by, and I found myself so engrossed that I was actually twitching, as if to evade fire.<br/><br/>One of the most infuriating negative comments I've read here is that the series is too focused on the Americans. To whomever said that: You should be ashamed of yourselves. Band of Brothers is about One company in one regiment in one division. It's not about World War II en masse, it's about the experience of E Company. It's not about the British or the Canadians. It's about a group of a few paratroopers in the 101st. If this was a series about British commandos (who are shown, in fact, when Easy is assigned to extract them from Arnhem after the failed Operation Market-Garden) then we wouldn't see the Americans.<br/><br/>In short: For a realistic, gritty, and personal look at World War II, look no further than Easy company, and settle down for Band of Brothers. You might find yourself having a bit more respect for your fathers and Grandfathers. I know I did. The superb production values of Hanks and Spielberg make this WWII mini-series stand head and shoulders above anything else that has ever been done.  Be warned.  Once you watch this series, you'll find it annoying to watch many of your old favorite movies, like "Battle of the Bulge," or "A Bridge Too Far."  That said, this is a must see series.  And Dreamworks, if you're listening, you MUST make this available in DVD format to the public...and soon! Band of Brothers is perhaps the best thing I've ever seen on TV.  It's not just great storytelling of a true story--it's high art.  I've never before seen a show that has made me laugh, cry or think so much.  It's not posturing or overly clean, the way older war movies are.  It's as real as war gets--everything from the horror to the wonderful banter between seasoned veterans.  Watching Band of Brothers is the very least a person can do to honor the enormous debt we all owe to the Allied soldiers that served in World War II.  We should thank them, because they saved many of us years before we were born. This is a 10-part mini-series brought to you by the team that produced Saving Private Ryan.  BOB has all the production values of SPR, and then some.  The players learned the game in SPR, and they're putting it on the screen in BOB.  Moreover, the plot in BOB is better, because it really happened.  The series repays consistent viewing, because it takes a while to get to know the characters, and to recognize them in uniform GI kit.<br/><br/>But the investment pays awesome dividends.  The writing is true to the original, backed by all-out research and interviews with the original troopers, but also embellishes with creative wit and compression.  By the middle few episodes (I'm at seven out of ten), the watching experience is taking on irresistible emotional force.  I can watch over and over and still not feel like all the taste is out of the gum.<br/><br/>The acting is superb, and the word is that everyone involved in the production, from producers to extras, treated the project as a very special opportunity to tell an inspiring story.  They tell it extremely well, and it does inspire. One of the best and most powerful viewing experiences I have ever had.  Doug Jordan Band of Brothers (BoB) is simply the finest, most accurate portrayal of men in combat ever put on the screen.  Unlike Saving Private Ryan, BoB is a true story with little fiction and some dramatic license.  I find myself feeling as though I know these men and they are my friends.  It hurts when they are lost or wounded.  Lots of loving care went into the movie by the actors. I read where the actor playing Skip Muck found out from Muck's sister and nieces about how proud he was to have swam the Niagara River.  Just before his death in BoB the Muck character talks about that event in his life.  I understand that in the final episode we get to find out the identities of all the "real" BoB members whose comments are heard at the beginning of each installment.<br/><br/>For those who are interested there are lots of good web sites with information concerning Easy Co. 2/516 PIR.  These sites have first hand accounts as well as lots of pictures of the men, then and now.  One site even has a memorial page with the date of death for those passing away after the war. I have just watched the first episode of the Steven Spielberg/Tom Hanks colaboration, BAND OF BROTHERS, and I must say it's very impressive.  There are 10 hour-long parts which will be broadcast over the next few months. Made for an astronomical budget of $120,000,000, it seems they spared no expense, and can see every cent of the budget put to good use.  There is great care in every detail, and the producers obviously wanted the series to look as authentic as possible.  I think they have achieved that.  The acting is top notch, and the decision to cast mostly unknown actors (there is a few big names, David Schwimmer as a sadistic Lieutenant is a highlight, and Donnie Wahlberg) but in large, the cast is unknown.  Damian Lewis, who plays Winters, is particularly impressive.  The series basically follows the saga of Easy Company, the 506th Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division of the US army.  The first epsiode takes us through the training regimen, then over to the fighting in Europe, then I suppose things will only get tougher from there.... I am interested in watching almost any well done film, tv program, or documentary about the second world war, and Band of Brothers manages to combine all three.  If you are a fan of Saving Private Ryan, or Thin Red Line, you will most definately want to check this series out.  Even if you aren't, a fan of War Films, and you just want to kick back, and be entertained by a great story, and good writing, this might be for you as well... Band of Brothers is one of the most powerful miniseries' ever. TV mini-series like Roots and Holocost  are also powerful. The series stays close to the book. I don't understand the critiscm from somebody about it only talking about the American part of the invasion. This was about the 506th Easy Company of the 101st Airborne, not the English aspect of the invasion. Steven Ambrose wrote an exellant book on Pegasis Bridge where the British paratroopers had to hold a bridge or the D-Day invasion was doomed. I hope they make a movie on that as well. Any ways, Band of Brothers was about a specific unit in the 101st Airborne. THis is worth getting HBO for. The battle scenes are intense, confusing and graphic.This is one excellant book that made an excellant movie. I just hope they sell it on video in time for the holidays. I plan on buying it That is how good and powerful it is. I have just watched episode 3 and whole series just gets better.  Dare I say better than Speilbergs SPR.  Two of the best action scenes I've seen (The attack on the town and the 'battle between the hedges).  Historically it looks spot on.  I would contest some of the comments made against it, there is no moralising, I didn't notice the music and its not 'schalmatzy'. Shows the conflict from both sides, often in graphic detail.  Some fine editing and yes CGI is evident, though fairly seemless.  One final request - DVD release soon PLEASE. This is an excellent adaptation of the invasion of Europe by Allied forces. The absence of any big name actors forces the focus onto the plot development. The characters portrayed are likeable and believable as one feels that similar personalities and reactions would exist during wartime. The only regret is that it appears only on cable and its impact today, particularly after September 11, would provide a message needed by all North Americans that right will prevail. This is not simply a war movie. It is the 1940s version of Survival! They were simpler times; we were a simpler people.  I don't know if they were the "Greatest Generation", but the straightforwardness with which Easy Company is portrayed speaks of a clarity of vision our current generation can no longer enjoy.  The ensemble acting suits the story-telling perfectly and the harrowing visual techniques (ala "Saving Private Ryan") are gut-wrenching - but not in a despairing fashion.  I have become completely involved with the characters and for the first time can understand how it is a soldier could possibly walk forward knowing he might be facing imminent death.  It seems a belief in what the fight was for made that kind of sacrifice possible.  Personally, in this day and age, I need to see that kind of selflessness and courage.  I think we are going to need it again. HBO has only shown 5 of the 10 episodes of "Band Of Brothers" but I've seen enough to tell you that when they re-air it, or release it on DVD or VHS watch it.  This type of show is the reason I subscribe.  It is unbelievable, you don't want the hour to end and you're on the edge of your seat the entire time.  Don't miss this show! I recently viewed the third part of the HBO mini-series "Band of Brothers", and loved it.  I was a huge fan of "Saving Private Ryan" and of Mr. Spielberg, and knew I would be in for an excellent ride.  I just couldn't believe how excellent it was.  The special effects are great and the story is easy to follow.  I especially like the lead actor, Damian Lewis.  He plays the part of Lt. Richard Winters as if he was born to be him.  I did not know he was English until I saw an interview with him on hollywood.com. It is difficult to keep up with who's who.  But, it all allows for an excellent ride.  This film deserves 2 thumps up!! This mini-series is possible the best thing I have ever seen on television! The writing is crisp and intelligence. The special effects and cinematography are outstanding. The acting is full of depth and power. Every elements comes together to create a masterpiece.<br/><br/>The best parts of this mini-series is how it is laced with sly touches of humor. Yet, it shows you the drama and the heart of these soldiers so it doesn't come off as whimsical or inappropriate. <br/><br/>The person that deserves an Emmy for his work is Scott Grimes. His portrayal of Donald Malarky is colorful, enriching, and shows his true range. Not that the other actors were bad or anything. It's just to me, Scott Grimes is the center jewel of this crown. <br/><br/>I urge you to watch this program! It's not just history it's a study of the human condition. Simply brilliant I don't think there was enough character development, I found it hard to remember who was who.  I also thought the music was distracting and annoying (we know war is horrible and dramatic without the orchestra shouting at us).<br/><br/>The most compelling parts are the real paratrooper veterans' reminiscences at the beginning and end of each episode. Takes you into the heart and soul of the action and the soldier in the midst of war.  A truly realistic portrayal of the war and its effect on the young men called to duty.  You feel what they feel and cry when they cry.  You experience their fears while admiring their bravery in the face of enemy fire time and time again.  You see them grow from boys to men.  Will stay with you long after the story has ended...... Probaby the best war movie ever made.A great performance from a great cast.The whole series is authentic,gritty and in some parts very moving. The accompanying documentary 'WE STAND ALONE TOGETHER' should be part of the CD when it's released, hopefully they will include clips or photo's of the actors against the real characters. What more can be said about this series. This is without a doubt the finest program ever offered for TV. I didn't even dare to hope it would be this good. Great acting, great filmmaking, great EVERYTHING!!! Do not miss this, in fact purchase this on DVD if possible, I know I will. It is as rewarding as SPR inevery aspect. In fact due to the length, I'd choose this over SPR as far as a recomendation. DO NOT MISS THIS! Currahee and The Day of Days Needless to say, I easily found myself in Saving Private Ryan Deja Vu, but I was expecting that.  It's simple, commanding presenses were entertaining to watch.  Intense, driving combat was backed by strong acting and a complex script.<br/><br/>The sheer complexity of it is also a downfall.  Steven Spielberg gave a very strong sense of place in SPR, which I don't find transposed here.  I continually became confused in even relatively calm scenes because I had no idea where characters were.  I only identified with actors I've seen in previous rolls, as most of the other actors all shared various facial similarities and all speak with the same 1940's sarcastic jib.  David Schwimmer was especially fun to watch as the Drill Sargent.  His typical type-casting as the whiner has not done this actor justice.<br/><br/>I noticed that I also had trouble following who was the main character. The scenes continually cut and the cast is so massive that all I could do was sit back and enjoy the carnage.<br/><br/>The cast is fantastic. The battles are furious and commanding.  The scenery is disturbing and peaceful.  Simply put, with some careful attention this film could be a classic. What an amazing film better than any war film to have been attempted over the last 100 years would recommend it to any body no matter if they like war films or not as the historical facts also add to the background of what is must have been like to be in the war and the friendships that they made that dont come along every day One of the best films ever made.  Ranks right up there with Gone With The Wind and all the other greats.  Everyone should see this film, especially the younger generation to get a grip and feel on what war is really like and an understanding of World War II and the sacrifices made by our now Senior generation. This is the finest miniseries ever shown on TV.  Brutal and graphic, but amazing and involving, it's like Ten hours of Saving Private Ryan. The way it's filmed and the excellent actors used, makes the viewer a part of the travails of this group of men, who learn to depend on one another through the horror of war.  A truly superb accomplishment, it should sweep the cable awards.  I'd like to see something done like this about the Marines in the Pacific and World War 1. Let me put it this way: I registered with IMDB for the sole reason of voting on Band of Brothers.  I like the shoot 'em up, kill 'em all type of war movies as much as the next hormonally unbalanced 19 year old, but that type of film doesn't quite do the job of taking it up a notch and becoming something special.  Regardless of genre, not many movies do; but this series really struck a cord and it took that next step.  Actually, it took all the steps.  From the masterful character development to the helplessness of battle and the heroism that can come out of it, I can say that this series stands far above any television endeavor and surpasses most pieces of classic film making.  These film makers show you a glimpse of each man and when that man leaves the screen, it seems like you gained another little piece of what it was like to be overseas at that time and in that place. I couldn't help but shed a few when it was all over.  I guess it was partly because this series became a treasured ritual for a friend and me, but mostly because of the things these men had been through and the feeling that I had been through all of it with them.  Thank you to the heroes of easy company.  Now when is this going to be sold on DVD? This WWII series captivated my attention for every minute of every episode. The cinematography was excellent as was the directing. The journey from the band of brothers first being trained to serve in the airborne division right up to Hitler's death is told supurbly. The character development is also excellent as you really start to feel you now them. Does anybody if and when the series is released on dvd? Sundays will never be the same without "Band of Brothers" I remember back in September '01, sitting in front of the tv watching the clock wind down in the corner of the screen anticipating the hyped images HBO would send. I thought the first episode was very informitive. It gave the viewer a good sense of who the characters were and what they went through together before they saw the battlefield. The special effects in Bastogne were awesome, but I'm dissatisified with Renee's, the Belgian nurse, fate. But, that's war I guess. Damian Lewis and Ron Livingston were a perfect blend for best buddies along with their costars: Donnie Walhberg, Neal McDonough, Scott Grimes, Rick Gomez, James Madio, Frank John Hughes, Eion Baily, Ross McCall and Shane Taylor made an awesome cast and did an exceptional job portaying their characters. And having one of the episodes fall on my birthday was a wonderful and exciting gift! This war series is by far the greatest war story ever shown on film.  There are no stars in this epic, only ordinary soldiers who go about doing there job in an extraordinary fashion. The focus is not on super heroes who are larger than life but on teamwork and self-sacrifice. What enthralled me the most was the objective look into the life of these men and the battles they waged.  The Germans soldiers are also depicted as human beings caught up in the tragic events that engulfed their nation and the world.  This is contrary to other popular films where the latter are shown as lobotomized idiots intent only on evil.  The surviving veterans of the 101st Airborne who courageously fought in the conflict will most certainly relive all the emotions they went through from D-Day to V-Day. > As the story unfolds over all 10 parts, you can feel yourself not wanting the story to end.  I could also feel myself right next to these men getting shot at each and every second.  The acting is flawless and the special effects are superb.  The best WWII documentary/drama I've ever seen! When's this out on DVD? From the first episode to the last this is the best TV series I have seen. Its production quality was as good/better than any movie. The locations were stunningly realistic and the acting was magnificent. This is a superbly accurate portrayal of an American Airborne Company from the build up to D-day until the end of the war. I think it was far better than the film that it branched from - Saving Private Ryan - and I thought that was superb. Tom Hanks has done it again. The first two episodes (Curahee and Day of Days) were engrossing and left me wanting more. The actors, mostly new or relatively unknown faces, were excellent. The feeling of the movie was definately accurate to the period. Good work Tom! I'm finally watching this because I'd heard so much about it. No doubt, it's competent and technically excellent, and I am enjoying it, but I wouldn't call it memorable.<br/><br/>Over the years, I've seen many war movies and series, and very few have been truly suspenseful and elicited the kind of emotion I would expect to feel while witnessing horrific and heroic events. This is another of those that fail the ever-so critical "suspense test". A more recently- produced failure was "The Hurt Locker", which was similarly competent, well-acted and interesting but which missed the target.<br/><br/>I guess I may set the bar too high, but there's only a handful of war movies which remain etched on my memory because they moved me one way or another- some small or quite modest productions, some of epic or near- epic proportions, some quite old, some fairly recent, some fictitious, some based on or depicting actual events- and which I would be pleased to see again. Perhaps a part of BoB will move me eventually, but so far, I'm not being enticed into a repeat viewing.<br/><br/>(Edit) Well, the heroics and ordeals of Medic Roe in Episode 6 were really worth watching, due in no small part to the actor's performance. But it was a long wait...it shouldn't take until more than halfway through a long series to get near a bullseye. I have had hard time to understand why this series has been so successful. Is it plot? Can't be, because there isn't one, warfilms usually don't have one. Most of scenes are so boring because they're all the same which we have seen thousands of times before, especially first in episode, which have all the clichés you can imagine. There is too much characters and they have been written so thin that it is very hard to care what happens to them. BoB also suffers lack drama between characters, mostly, again because of thin characters. That's quite strange, because they have 10 episodes time to develop the characters So what is good in BoB? Well it looks good, that's all. It reminds me the exploitation movies, because it's biggest value seem to be to "show it all" ("most realistic war series ever"), action is in leading role, and actors don't have anything to act, what a waste of talent. Unfortunately it seems that most of the people think that the most important value of war film is "realism", with real uniforms, tanks & weapons.<br/><br/>BoB is kind of pseudo-document of war. Good looking, empty war illustration. This series is the best war movie/series I've ever seen. It shows both the glorious moments as well as the not so glorious moments on both sides of the war - Just like Stephen Ambrose's book. The only reason why I couldn't give the full score is that there is a bit too much action and tempo in the series making it a bit hard to comprehend the first time you see it. There is a lot of scenes, the viewer ought to digest a bit longer to feel the full horror of war.<br/><br/>The special effects a near to perfect, but it annoys me that passing rifle and machinegun (MG42/MG34) shots makes a buzzing instead of the "crack'ing" sound they actually makes caused by the the super sonic speed of the bullets (Most of the time they had that right in "Saving Private Ryan). Very professionally made, but an untrue image of what WW II was all about. It idealizes war and the Americans are the heroes once again. Lose the nationalism and it's a nice series, also for the rest of the world! This is not only my idea, but also jack Wouters's, one of Holland's best actors, who played a small part ("Dutch farmer") in Band of Brothers. "Band of Brothers" is one of those rare cinematic endeavors which transcends entertainment. The made-for-tv miniseries traces the activities of the men of the 101st Airborne Rangers of Easy Company from boot camp to D-Day to the Battle of the Bulge to the conclusion of WWII. A beautiful and noble achievement and an incredibly complex production, "Band.." transports the audience into the horror of war at the level of the foot soldier as it moves with stealth and fidelity from one poignant moment to another imparting a sense of the WWII experience as few films have ever done. A likely candidate for numerous Emmys, "Band..." is a "keeper" with a message for everyone who ever wondered about the price of freedom and a lesson for those who never did. I get very confused when I see WWII stuff from Spielberg.<br/><br/>Some of the time I think I'm watchin' Republican Spielberg who is pro American, pro soldier, pro military, pro heroes. (But I know he's not the director.) Then I think I'm watchin' Democrat Spielberg who clearly infers the horrors of war, the politics of the military, the ineptness of the military and of war.<br/><br/>This did both and I was turned off by Republican Spielberg.<br/><br/>This is an easy one as WWII was a justifiable war. Good vs. Evil. And the soldiers that participated get the kudos.<br/><br/>But I am also torn by the obvious aspects of soldiering. To me, soldiers are brainwashed into fighting. They are indoctrinated in the hero aspects, the glory aspects. Thus, they fight the same and have the same "drive" to keep fighting even though it's a crap shoot if you die or not. In the end, are they heroes? I guess but were driven to blindly run into the fire by design and not so much inner resolve.<br/><br/>That is what I got out of this epic. When they tried to sell me that these men were special and pure heroes, I didn't buy it. They were programmed. What it also did sell me was that war is Hell, and outdated concept and nothing that anyone should go through. I don't know if these men were true heroes or just puppets, but I know I would be catatonic for decades from the mental scars.<br/><br/>(And excessive use of hand-held camera, which is the bane of my cinema viewing existence.) The best serie To me ... awosome history .. Hbo congratulation, i am now watching Band of Brothers again for about the millionth time. This the round, with my 19- year-old son who had seen snippets previously, but not watched the whole thing from start to finish. It is one of those series which just never loses its appeal.<br/><br/>First of all, the cast are absolutely brilliant, from top to bottom. Obviously, special mentions for Damien Lewis, Ron Livingston, Neal McDonough, Frank John Hughes and Donnie Wahlberg. Damien Lewis puts in the performance of a lifetime as Richard Winters.<br/><br/>The writing is brilliant, the effects are stupendous and the attention to reality and detail is incredible, from uniforms to weapons to vehicles. You name it, they have it covered. Even the sound effects, as anyone who has experienced the sounds of battle will testify, are incredibly realistic.<br/><br/>Listening to the veterans, at the start of each episode, is wonderful. It was a great tribute to a generation who showed incredible bravery in fighting to save our way of life and defeat a monster. This series will live on as a fitting tribute.<br/><br/>We have the Blu-Ray box-set and the quality is staggering, with ever little detail visible as clear as day. It's worth investing in the Blu-Ray box-set over the DVD! And if you have not seen this series, you really need to get hold of it and watch it.<br/><br/>It is, without doubt, unsurpassed in TV history. so few shows like this one now a days. Band of brothers expresses such emotion and captivates the audience. the way the show is set up is nothing but amazing. Band of Bother delivers a very personal look at Easy company and their trials and tribulation in WWII, the men in this riveting story have experienced it all. Band of Brother is the kind of show that will leave wanting more and more, i finished it two days i was completely hooked. you don't even have to be a fan of military premised shows to enjoy this masterpiece of film, no other show has made me feel the way i felt when watching this show. i actually cried when i finished the show because i knew that there was no more left to watch, this show will leave you hooked and satisfied. Band of Brothers is simply put, superb. The film making, casting and cinematography is excellent. As you progress with the series you get a deep understanding of the characters and what life must of been like in such a horrific time. <br/><br/>I've seen a few films on The Battle of the Bulge that have covered the historical events of that battle but Band of Brothers makes you feel you are there, living it, trying to stay alive.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it, you are missing out one of the best pieces of work done on WWII. It is an amazing account of the bond between soldiers during the war, beautifully shot. If it is heartening, it's because it defies cynicism and reveals the realities of courage, compassion, and brotherhood as real men in a horrendous war practiced it.<br/><br/>It truly is a masterpiece. "Band of Brothers" is one of my all time favorite series to have been on TV, and of course standing on my DVD collection shelves, along with "The Walking Dead".<br/><br/>So what is it that makes "Band of Brothers" so special? Well, for starters it is the array of impressive and well-played characters that are portrayed throughout the series. These are characters that you really form a bond with despite sitting in front of a screen. They are vibrant, realistic, and all together just amazingly portrayed, unlike the "The Pacific" series, also from HBO, where the characters were more distanced and less open to let you into their personalities.<br/><br/>But more than the characters, it is also the way that the entire series is shot. The cinematography and camera-work in the series is nothing short of spectacular. It is intense and action-packed, almost like you are right there with the soldiers in the midst of the chaotic combat of World War II.<br/><br/>If you enjoy World War II action, then you definitely have to get acquainted with "Band of Brothers". If you aren't already familiar with this series, you have truly been missing out on a great experience. And if you enjoyed "Saving Private Ryan", you just simply have got to sit down and watch this entire series.<br/><br/>Despite it being from 2001, "Band of Brothers" is timeless and it is one of those series that you can watch repeatedly, as the entertainment value of the series, the characters, the action, etc. is just top notch. I have sat through the entire series four times already, and I will most likely be playing it more times in the future. The first time I saw Band of Brothers was in 2007 when I turned on the TV and they were showing it on spike channel. I couldn't get enough after seeing episodes 5 and 6 so I recorded every episode and bought the dvds and even read the book by Stephen ambrose. Band of brothers is the best shows HBO has ever produced, the best mini-series ever, and overall the best world war 2 film of all time (better than Saving Private Ryan).It was filmed in 2001 but you couldn't tell the difference because filming is so good. The story of these men is awe-inspiring and if you haven't watched it yet, watch the first five minutes and you will be hooked. Curahee! As a kid my father exposed me to plenty of WWII imagery and stories, and I have always been fascinated by them, as many have. Having watched Saving Private Ryan with him, not so long before he died - the first time he went to see a film in nearly twenty years, and his last - I would have loved for him to have seen this too. So watching it has a special emotional dimension for me, as, again, it has to many people who have similar experience with parents who have faced war.<br/><br/>With astonishing eye for their craft, everyone who has worked on and acted in this has done a remarkable job. The soundtrack, also, is a remarkable achievement which stands on its own. I can't praise this series highly enough to friends, and always hope to but rarely do discover television of its quality. An absolute joy to watch and watch again. This one is the best war movie in the history, and it's not on the "top-250" :( But you know; "Taegukgi Brotherhood of War" have about "3000 votes" and "Band of Brothers" got's about "29000 votes" and it have more points (9.6 - 8.6) Can someone give me an answer?<br/><br/>FAQ about the movie:<br/><br/>EASY COMPANY in 101st airbourne division 506 PIR. About 30 guys who stays very close to they other. They going thru Normandy, Bastogne, Carentan and much more. As I said, it's the best War movie ever! It's very realistic with the bonus disc, look at it! :D<br/><br/>I recommend it with everything in my heart! :) As a TV Series, Band of Brothers is formidable. Every episode is like a short movie. Acting is great although I didn't know any of those actors. Filming is much more beautiful than in any other American war movie.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan was only made for American audience. This one is made for Americans, Europeans and Asians because, like most of European war movies, it shows realistic sides of war. Like in the second episode (was it?) one of the soldiers try to tease German prisoners and discover one of them is actually American. And MANY TIMES they mention that most of the German soldiers in the western front are kids and grandpas because Russia is doing the major work. Also they mention how much Britain does for Europe (They tell how many men Britain lost in a battles etc)<br/><br/>Americans are not shown as heroes, they steal stuff etc. after capturing villages.<br/><br/>Who should watch this series? Everybody. Nobody should get any patriotic feelings from it. If you like it, I would recommend these movies: All quiet in the western front, Stalingrad, Winter War. As realistic stuff but years before BOB. "Band of Brothers" is clear candidate for the most stark, stunning production on war ever made. It supplants the first third of "Saving Private Ryan" when the dropping bow ramps of the landing craft threw us into the mindless chaos of an amphibious landing against fierce, concentrated, largely unseen resistance.<br/><br/>This meticulous 10-part series is not crafted to send a message, but to pull us into the complete and constant violence of pitched battles in which terrified, but trained and disciplined soldiers move to an objective through the lethal clouds of metal -- bullets, shrapnel, shards, needles -- killing, maiming, wounding, altering.<br/><br/>"Brothers" moves us and its men through many clashes, each of a different size and shape, and shows us two fundamentals among many -- that war is generally stretches of discomfort, boredom, and fatigue punctuated by terrible violence, violence that takes every conceivable form, which usually kills and maims impersonally by cold, impassive lottery. And that through this horror, determined bands of men cling together, move together, and unite together to do their duty as best they can.<br/><br/>But "Brothers" takes us much further into this horrific and heroic trek than any other film has because the makers of the series have grasped that it is Everyman and Anyman that go to World Wars, and any true discernment of those men only becomes clear through the terrors of battle and sustained campaign -- if they survive long enough. <br/><br/>Unlike nearly all other war films, which focus on a specially gifted hero, a few 'characters', a supporting cast, and an incident or two, nearly every man in this long World War campaign is asked to rotate to stage center if we can follow him long enough. Some will die, some will live, some will be wounded, a few will be maimed. Some will take the lead, some will shrink away. Some will make decisions, others will pale at them. Most will stumble to recover and put face forward again, some will stumble and just lie down.<br/><br/>There are bad officers, and good officers, good soldiers and bad soldiers, and the whole mélange in between. The bad officers and men are usually discarded, their effect too harmful on The Band to be tolerated.<br/><br/>We follow one parachute unit -- 'Easy Company of the 506th Airborne Regiment of the storied 101st Airborne Division. We get to know many of the Band, some only transiently. Of 140 to start the D-Day drops, only 79 were still alive a month later. And more were to fall, the gashes in the company filled by a steady flow of awed replacements.<br/><br/>We get to know them, their training, their terrible anxieties, their personalities, in ones and twos during parts of each episode. We suffer with them, hope for them, but rarely judge them, for the task they are given is too awful and too difficult for us to adjudge them -- for they are not movie characters, they are all of us.<br/><br/>Sometimes we get one soldier confused for another, which is at first disconcerting in an art form very adept at, and very conscious of, keeping characters distinct for us. But it becomes 'natural' in "Brothers", because they are in green combat apparel, and are trained to become a cohesive unit. Nearly homogeneous. Soon they become distinct as they need to be.<br/><br/>Only one soldier gets constantly singled out, because he was such a special and selfless and steady leader. But he is that special leader, NOT -- as most films portray -- because he is quirky or colorful or rebellious or 'different', but because he is the sum of his character and his integrity, of his training, of his humanity. And of his absolute commitment to his men. He is the combat leader of REAL war, not of filmic fantasia.<br/><br/>This production takes us from airborne training in Georgia through Normandy and the many battles across Europe and into Germany.<br/><br/>We, like the soldiers in this campaign, constantly wait for the next eruption -- whether a mass attack or air raid, or a single and sudden tragedy or accident. From which we, and this Band of Brothers must rise, for there is more to come. More to be done.<br/><br/>The technical craft in this series is special -- sometimes shot and cut steadily ... sometimes quirky and jerkily, as violence erupts ... sometime eerily or slowly or mistily or rapidly, as we enter the mind of a single soldier. The impeccable editing draws many essences of war, but one above all others -- cacophony and arrhythmia. <br/><br/>In their toolbox of deafening sounds of battle is a new one. A quick, whizzing moan -- a bullet that has passed within a fraction of an inch. <br/><br/>There are many nice techniques that do not call attention to themselves, but add texture to this fine work, such as several deft scenes in which we learn of the aggregate losses since D-Day, one so subtle and quiet that we are not quite aware of it until drawn up into near-mystical bonds unbroken even by death.<br/><br/>We expect things, we anticipate things, yet we are constantly surprised as something unimagined occurs other than what we are prepared and trained for. Or nothing happens at all, which can be even more disconcerting, more unsettling -- to soldier and viewer.<br/><br/>It is a monument, not to war, not AGAINST war, but to the men who were caught up in the greatest of all wars, and for the most part did the very best they could. It is a campaign that cannot be defined, only absorbed. Go on this trek with Easy Company, this Band of Brothers.<br/><br/>For this trek was  and is  very real.<br/><br/>(If I may suggest, rent the tapes or DVD's. You may then stop, restart, re-view pieces that intrigue you -- there are many.) If you decided not to watch "Band of Brothers" just because it's produced by Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, think again. This series, unlike "Saving Private Ryan", is non-fiction and is not hurt by a cast of well-known actors and a half bad story.<br/><br/>"Band of Brothers" is the story about E(asy) Company, 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne Division during World War 2. The story is very well told, and varies between different peoples points of view. The actors are all leaser known actors but are perfectly suited for the roles they play, which they all play very well.<br/><br/>The fact that the story is real makes this production even better, because most other war movies have somewhat of a weak story. But by choosing to portray the story of a Company whose history is well documented and was made up by a wide, colorful variety of characters, this mini-series becomes something that can't really be remade in another series.<br/><br/>The only thing which I would criticize is the way they shoot this series. Like "Saving Private Ryan", "Band of Brothers" utilize much of the same "shaky cam" that they used on "Ryan". This can get rather annoying after a while. But apart from that, the series is beautifully shot, with excellent special effects.<br/><br/>This is a series everyone should watch, war buffs and non-war buffs alike. It has plenty of action, a good story, excellent acting and a very humane side to it, not just "kill the bastard!". A very deserving 10/10. The training scenes were not as well constructed as Full Metal Jacket or even An Officer and Gentleman due to focus being on the officers rather than the breaking and making of the men. Once the invasion commences the action hots up fast with an excellent parachute scene and quickly builds to a peek in the taking of a German gun position. Alpha male officers and NCOs soon prevail over lesser gifted officers with good examples of leading from the front. The fighting seemed very realistic with good Dolby surround sound, although the Germans still seemed to be unable to shoot accurately compared to the US forces. I feel that the director failed to show the overwhelming advantage of Recce and attack over defense and translated this instead to better individual marksmanship. For me the later episodes revealed a gradual reduction in the expenditure rate per hour, but overall a great story about male camaraderie and bonding in extreme situations. Television just doesn't get any better than this!! Superb from start to finish. The acting and cinematography is simply grand. You felt that you were with Easy Company every step of the way. I personally don't see how this mini-series can be topped. Don't be fooled by any false voices from Germany. Most of us WERE Nazis during the war. Most of us DID support the system. 'Band Of Brothers' IS an honest account of what was to be found on the western front. And it was only a weak shadow of what would've been found on the Eastern Front. Never forget. NEVER forget. Don't be fooled. Worse is to come if you do. Watch 'Band Of Brothers'.<br/><br/>
reluctantly German Schogger13 I saw this mini series whilst living in Thailand. At the time of it's showing I was working long hours so my wife recorded each episode for me and I watched them when I got home, often at 2 am. After the first few episodes it became the thing that kept me going as my working day got longer and longer. I can honestly say that the series is excellent. The way that the film stock and camera work changes from quiet character building moments to full on action is superb. All of the actors play there roles exceeding well (although I couldn't help asking myself what Ross from friends was doing there at regular intervals).<br/><br/> I enjoyed it so much that I went out and bought the book. After reading the book I can say that they did a good job. A few parts are Hollywooded  up, the concentration camp section as an example, but overall, very well done. I enjoyed the way that the first few episodes gave a broader look at the situation and then the middle episodes concentrated on certain characters and then back to the larger picture for the end. The episode which concentrates on the medic stands out from the rest as the action content is lower but the suspense and character work are brilliant.<br/><br/> All in all, if you haven't seen this and you are at all interested in true life stories (about the WWII or anything) you can do a lot worse than seeing this series. I know it's 10 hours long but if you take some time and just watch a couple of episodes a day(no surfing at the same time or chatting with your mates) the time just flies by and you'll be restless all the next day pining for your next fix. This was a great series. It was important. It opened the eyes of a viewing nation to the realities of men at war. It captured a time and a book (Band of Brothers) with unflinching grit. Dick Winters is finally recognized as the great leader that he was and likely still is. I give it a 8 out of 10, mainly because the series loses force after the first few episodes. Each subsequent episode is less climactic than the previous. Perhaps this is a function of the material. But it can't be ignored.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I've gone out and purchased all the Ambrose books I haven't read yet. There is no great reason, no personal heroism, no miracle of resurrection, only the most real scene of war. This is the original appearance of the war, not as those crude domestic war dramas preach, not that the enemies are all heinous villains, we are all heroic and incomparable God of war, no matter who are ordinary people are flesh and blood, they will hurt, they will bleed, they will die and they will be afraid. But they are all heroes. Noticed that Albert Blithe in episode 3 Carentan was shown as shot in the Neck and passing away in 1948. Blithe became a Master Sargent and passed away in 1967. With 696 reviews, much has been favorably discussed. However, in Episode 10, Part 5, Spielberg grabbed me, for the last and perhaps the greatest. In this scene a German unit is taken prisoner as a whole, and the commander is permitted to address his men one more time. In that address, although talking to his men, the words described Easy Company too, all dedicated units of the 101st, and many soldiers in combat. Spielberg knew that - it was the last battle-related scene. Everything about this series have been worked through in a thorough, realistic, valuable ond not least honourable way covering all aspects of the horrible years for both the troopers and the civilians.
I have seen it some 15+ times and can still find some new angles to watch it from.
Now I am watching a documentary about WWII in which it is being portrayed all the way from WWI and to the end of WWII.
Very breathtaking to see how totally outrageous things can turn out "just because" one guy with ambitions and a country feeling stepped on decides to make a new world order.
I become humble and truly grateful about thinking of the fact that so relatively few chose to give so incredibly much so I/we today can live in a free western democracy.
It is furthermore my prayer that we do not forget the past, and what these guys did for us, but still bear in mind and keep learning from it so that we will never allow this to happen again! As a great fan of war movies and in particular of "Saving Private Ryan", I certainly could not "let me escape": Band of Brothers, which I personally consider one of the most beautiful TV series of all time. This series, released in 2001, had remained unknown to me until this year. Once I learned of his existence I did not waste any time and I looked at her in one breath. This series, in addition to being nothing short of spectacular from the point of view of historical accuracy and special effects, tells with charisma and evocative emotions the characters (really existed), their stories and their adventures.
"Band of Brothers", moreover, manages to make you identify perfectly with the characters, so much so that it seems to live their experiences in first person ... I must definitely congratulate Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, who together created a series like this: fascinating, electrifying, accurate and suggestive, able to make me move many times. Concluding I recommend this series to all fans of the genre and not only ...
A warm greeting from Sombrero. Till date the best show I have seen! This show changed something in me. What were these men made of? It leaves you wondering! 
The whole team deserves a salute! Respect Guys! The show is simply astounding! Watched this series years ago. Words can't describe how good this is. Then, watch this one only. I know the Normandy area perfectly. When I see how the 101 and the others, of course, did what those children did, and this representation of how real fear is (not to be confused with cowardice) <br/><br/>(I left wondering, could we bring the spirit of those kids back to countries like Venezuela? Here cowards of both sides destroyed the country without shooting at anything). <br/><br/>(I can see it every day for the benefit of my job. There are priceless management lessons that we can't ignore today) A very well done WW2 series based on a Stephen Ambrose book. The reasons these men volunteered are various. I dont think the average soldier had a choice. For some reason the U S is stuck on D Day. My father who was drafted early had already fought thru N Africa, Sicily, Salerno, and he was at Monte Cassino. D Day was not the first invasion of Europe. It as not the first opening of a second front. These paratroopers were late to the game.
I think the WW2 generation was the last to fight the goodfight. Nobody was as evil as the Nazi regime. The Soviet state was pretty bad but they did do most of the fighting in WW2 and suffered most of the casualties. 
The detail and sets of BB are really excellent. I wonder why most of the actors are British? Damian Lewis has made a career of playing Americans and he does it well. The actors in this do a fine job of being American.??!! I only recently stadted watching this and realistic non fiction is better than fiction like Saving Private Ryan. We should honor these vets and recreating their deeds does that. Best war series ever.
This series is so unbelievably realistic in a word is awesome. I couldn't wait to see each episode Band of brothers seems like a very well thought out short series. Each episode represented a part of war and what effect it had on a soldier. By the third episode, I had no doubt that by the time I end the series, BoB would have earned its reputation. And so it did. You could expect to get a little sentimental by the end. Especially the part where they introduce the men behind the characters. It makes you understand the price of war and the cost of peace. It also makes you question the meaning of life. World War 2, told from the perspective of a company of American paratroopers that were involved in a long campaign after the Normandy landings. High production values and a good story to tell make this a very enjoyable mini-series. <br/><br/>Fortunately I have never been in a real war, but this seemed realistic and down-to-earth, based as it is on a real story. At the beginning of each chapter, you get the comments of the real soldiers who fought in that company, now old men, and that adds a lot of moral authority to the story. That realism means that we do not get a continuous action fest, but for me it was very interesting to watch.<br/><br/>There is not an extremely spectacular sequence like the disembark in Saving Private Ryan. The budget here is not quite that high, but it's high enough to offer a quality production.

But this film makes you feel as you are in there, the WWII. The show itself is quite honest (it itself very unusual for the films "made in US") - action, characters, behavior, history, etc... - all is real... There is no Rambo, or other "Heroes" - there are just a people who should fight the enemy, and they are trying to do all the best they can...<br/><br/>This film is one of the best films about war I ever saw. This show is literally the best I have ever seen. It is like watching a kid grow up, but instead "brothers" evolving through the war. It isn't too graphic but has a fair amount of blood in it, which is a good thing for at least ages 12 and up. When you finish the show, it gives you a feeling that you don't want it to end. You want to stay and grow along beside the soldiers. You want to see how they evolve when they go home. You don't want them to leave, but to rather stay. I have never felt this way about any other television show, or movie. I WAS SO DEPRESSED WHEN IT ENDED! I really just wanted to see more. If you have not seen this show, rent it, buy it, see it. It will change the way you think when the topic turns to war. How these brave men struggles. You will not regret seeing this show, and if you see someone who doesn't like it, they probably hate America and has no emotions and/or feelings. This show will always be remembered to me and to everyone who has seen it. ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ For the 70th anniversary of D-Day, I pulled out the DVDs and decided to watch BOB for the 3rd time. Frankly, this is not an easy series to watch and doing so dredges up emotions that don't often surface. That said, the series is a jaw dropper. I am at awe as to how these men could fight in a serious campaign....and then another, another, and another. Just when you think it is bad for them....it gets worse.<br/><br/>But through it all, you can come to love these young men and come to appreciate their deep love for their compatriots who they trained along side and then fought along side. It was excruciating to watch as many of my favorites got wounded or killed and I can't imagine what it must have been like for these heroes who had to deal with losing many of their close friends on a regular basis. War truly is hell! It is easy to understand how these men became very close after the war. When you depend on each other for your very lives, it is a trust walk of the highest order....and nothing compares to that in ordinary life. Thus, the 506th regiment of the 101st airborne have a deep affection, respect, and love for one another that can't be earned any other way except via teasing death many times during the war.<br/><br/>It is important to note that while these heroes fought the Germans, they actually fought to liberate all of Europe, including Germany. I have seen a couple of negative comments from German reviewers on this site, but the men of Easy Company helped to end the war and remove a tyrant of all the people giving the German people a freedom that they would not have realized under a Nazi government.<br/><br/>The second war for Easy Company was when they returned home after the war. At that point, they had to ponder the many friends that they had lost, the emotional scars that seemed endless and without understanding to those who did not serve, and trying to adjust to a life that did not require them to be on high alert 24/7. Fighting as they did in Europe was unfathomable and many that were wounded would hurry back to the front lines to fight alongside their friends. It is hard to imagine such a driven attitude in today's society of easy living.<br/><br/>If you get a chance, you should really watch this series a minimum of two times. The first time to experience the battles and the various emotional hurdles of Easy Company. The second time to really gather a deep and sincere appreciation for the price that these men paid for what we enjoy today. It has been said that the price of freedom is not free....and the men of Easy Company give those of us who never picked up a gun in battle an idea of the price of this freedom. It was an expensive purchase, but I am grateful for someone paying the price for me. Typically praised as one of the best mini-series of all time, how good is actually Band of Brothers?<br/><br/>Band of Brother centers around the war efforts by Easy Company, 506 regiment of the 101's Airborne Division. It seems like it got it all. Great characters, great action scenes, historical accuracy, accurate military conduct and a great plot to go with it.<br/><br/>After first seeing this, my mind was made up, greatest ever. Just pure magic. Although the series was loved both by the critics and the audience, some criticism was levelled at the series. Mainly that there was no cohesive story throughout the series, no red thread.<br/><br/>Focusing more on the company has both some advantageous and some disadvantageous, the main advantageous is that it can focus on the action, and easily show character development in multiple characters in short time, without slowing down the story, or damaging the story. This also gives some amount of realism to the story.<br/><br/>The main disadvantageous without having building up characters throughout the series is that you don't get so attached to many of the battle scenes. You are more impressed with the action, then focusing on the drama.<br/><br/>But they did have some fairly good dramatic scenes where you felt attachment to the characters, in many ways they didn't take a dive into the dramatic situations, but showed it with restrained and a few seconds filled with emotions.<br/><br/>I think the interviews with the veterans set the dramatic tone of the story. We are explained what the story is going to be like, and their calm, collected and subtle but powerful emotional demeanour gives enough of the personal bond we can form with the characters, or feel like what they went through.<br/><br/>To my (inferior) knowledge, they get military jargon and language correct, and the orders barked during fight scenes is something that could be very close to how it is in real life. This add something to the mix, rather then slowing it down with unimportant detail.<br/><br/>My main problem with the series is that the soldiers are way too brave, honorable, and righteous that it seems like they are the best human beings ever lived. You also have some derailing stories that never go anywhere that doesn't add to the story. But this is mostly nitpicking.<br/><br/>It is just a masterpiece, great directing, writing, acting, visuals, and cinematography, in my mind it holds the unofficial title of being the best mini-series of all time. Maybe even the best depicting of war as well. "Currahee!" Not known by many, but known by men who served in Easy Company. Band of Brothers is an HBO mini-series that follows the men who served in the 101st Airborne Division, Easy Company. This mini series will take you all the way from the very first day of Airborne training, all the way up to the capture of Hitler's Bavarian Retreat. Easy Company will suffer heavy losses, losing everything from body parts all the way up to best friends.<br/><br/>The HBO series begins with Training Day, where the men of Easy Company endure gruesome basic training to become paratroopers. With "Friends" actor David Schwimmer playing Easy Company's commander, with Damian Winters as Easy Company's 1st Sergeant. HBO also began introducing many other characters that come into play throughout the mini-series. With many different personalities throughout Easy Company, tensions are high between many of the men.<br/><br/>With the series continuing into D-Day, we also see how Easy Company influenced the war effort, including their impact on the famous mission Operation:Market Garden. The series also shows the hardships the men went through, especially through Bastogne, more famously known as the Battle of the Bulge, which Easy Company played a huge role in.<br/><br/>After the gruesome training, losing their friends in attacks against German offenses, losing limbs, and being away from home for almost four years, the men of Easy Company finally reach the final stretch of the war. With Allied forces pushing on Hitler's Bavarian Retreat, Easy Company will be headed home in no time. However, after the countless battles, the friends they've lost, the sacrifice they made, the 101st Airborne Division will surely not be going home the same.<br/><br/>This HBO series was an incredible way to depict World War II. In many war movies, the directors are mainly focused on how the Allied forces are affected. Band of Brothers takes a completely different cut at it, with not only showing the hardships the men of Easy Company go through, but also the European people. The mini series shows the rubble of bombings throughout all of Europe, and shows how the people of Europe had suffered because of it.<br/><br/>This series is also very good at showing the other side of war. Many people have a depiction that war is all guns and violence, but Band of Brothers, once again, takes a completely different look at it. Not only does it show the graphic scenes of blood and gore and the violence of war, but it also shows the political side of the war. It showed the Allied forces great entrance into Poland, as well as many of Easy Companies mens interaction with the European people, and not always in a friendly way.<br/><br/>As well as the political side, HBO did an outstanding job displaying how gruesome war actually is. Many movies do not show the violence and gore that comes along with war, but HBO has no problem getting into detail with it. From bleeding arteries, to completely destroyed body parts, HBO does a fantastic job displaying it.<br/><br/>One thing that HBO did a fantastic job on was creating in-depth characters, which related to how they were in real life. HBO did an absolutely fantastic job in character development throughout the series. I was definitely attached to many of the characters throughout the series, and faced several jaw-dropping moments when some of the most inspirational and bravest characters would die or suffer an incredible injury. HBO did a great job showing how each character acted in different situations, and surely did an amazing job at getting people attached to certain characters.<br/><br/>The only problem that I had seen with the series is that the mini-series was somewhat historically inaccurate. At Battle of the Bulge, men of Easy Company were told to remove their Eagle patches off of their uniforms, to show that the Germans were not fighting an elite company of soldiers. They also killed off many of the characters, that did not die in real life. For example, Sergeant Blithe, a member of Easy Company, was shot through the neck while fighting in Europe. The series says that he then died in 1948. However, Blithe was actually shot in the shoulder, and lived until 1967, where he died while on active duty in Germany. I also found that while watching the series, many of the items had moved around from place to place every time the camera angle had changed. Although it wasn't a huge thing, it was still quite annoying.<br/><br/>Overall, I would give this mini-series a 9.5/10. This series did an absolutely amazing job depicting the war that Easy Company had to conflict day in and day out. HBO made a great war movie that wasn't just about war. They made a movie that showed the hardships of the men of Easy Company, as well as the people of Europe. They also made an incredible series that showed the importance of the Allied forces in Europe. There were some technical errors, hence why I took off a small portion of rating, but the goods definitely outweigh the bads in this situation. HBO, once again, did an incredible job at creating a visually and emotionally stunning mini series. I will definitely look into more series made by HBO, especially ones as in-depth and as heart wrenching as Band of Brothers. In the end, after everything Easy Company has been through, they still remember Currahee; we stand alone, together. I loved this show.<br/><br/>It's close to impossible to beat Damian Lewis. I've watched him in Life, Band of Brothers and Homeland and he plays each character with impeccable accuracy.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is also amazing, many of the starts were already famous or have become famous since and suffice to say they make this show what it is.<br/><br/>I was astounded by the realism portrayed in this show and it has brought forth great respect in me for our veterans, it can be very emotional at some points, but none-the-less it makes for a amazing show. I am usually really critical about WW2 movies and series, but Band of Brothers was an exceptional tale of a group of men making there way through the darkness and misery of war. The acting and real life portrayal of these men were outstanding, I felt I knew these men personally and was hypnotized by the story line the series followed. If Hollywood is to make any other WW2 based movies or series, they need to take notes from this masterpiece. I like the fact that a lot of the actors were not big names, that usually detracts from the films intense meaning and story line. The cut scenes to the real WW2 military men "fit the bill" perfectly, and at the last scene where Major Winters as himself, talks about his Grandson, sums up the movies message. I hope to see more of WW2 films after watching this. I watched this miniseries some time in the past but my mind cannot get off of it.<br/><br/>This is the best thing ever, if I had to have one thing to watch for the rest of my life, this would be it.<br/><br/>The acting is superb, the directing is flawless, and the quality of the visuals is superb.<br/><br/>There is nothing weak about this series, every episode brings perfection, and this miniseries is as close to perfection as a crisp cold beer in the summer.<br/><br/>Watch this series, I know it's long, but if things that were great weren't long, then you'd be left longing for more! I find this too short, but if they added more time, there's a chance the quality could have suffered. Enjoy it while you can! MUST SEE THIS! We have literally tons of reviews that go on and on usually with an agenda written into each sentence. I normally just disregard the reviews on IMDb because of this but this series deserves so much more than anyone can say in words.<br/><br/>This series is what filming is all about. It is quite simply the best media I have ever viewed and is a life changing experience for viewers. It brings WWII and the men that served in it home to those of us lucky enough to be born in a time that benefits from their sacrifices. They're your fathers, grandfathers, uncles, brothers, friends, or just the guy down the street. They were born and at a very young age before they could even form "dug in" opinions or develop further biases and agendas they were suddenly thrown into an unimaginable situation. On a medical side not it is stunning to note that most of these boys lived through this before their brains were even fully developed or skulls welded. Watch it and learn, be touched, and be proud of them. I had seen Band of Brothers Episode 1 and 2 when it was broadcast in HBO but couldn't catch upto the rest of the series....now after a long time I saw it from episode 1-10 and it made me feel something.....something that I never experienced from other series and only experienced when I saw Saving Private Ryan in theatre......Band of Brothers is truly motivating,captivating and above all holds moral values together...I among others thought that WW2 was over when Hitler had died but this was a new revelation to me..........The ending is great and all hands to STeven Spielberg&Tom Hanks for putting up this great series..........The actors too have done a great job................I recommend everyone to see this series Produced by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks (who also directed one of the better Parts) "Band of Brothers" through 10 parts, the first one being training, the second D-Day and the last ones victory in Europe, follows the men of paratroppers' Easy Company through big battles, trench warfare, surprises, death, loses,shock, helplessness, laughter, conflicts, friendship, love and their everyday lives. <br/><br/>Almost every episode is better than the previous one, and each one of them starts with mini-interviews with the real men from the Easy Company, the same ones we see the adventures of on the screen. It is the last episode though, that we learn "who is who". Those last words, of the real soldiers who survived this war, make a man cry... Trust me!<br/><br/>As the film-making goes, the battle sequences are huge, and in some middle Parts are almost whole-episode-long. The violence is realistic. Not always bloody, sometimes extremely. Like war. The characters are realistic, the acting absolutely believable. I cannot find anything bad to say about cinematography either. The music stays in your mind after those 10 Parts, and... that's a good thing. a Beautiful score. And a beautiful story.<br/><br/>"Band of Brothers" stands alone as one of the best military productions ever made! Hands down! Every part felt like it's own movie and had a lot of detail that was coherent with World War II. You can easily see the emotions between the soldiers. The battles have an incredible action and detail. The wounds looked very real and was accompanied with good acting. The dialog was well written and fit into war perfectly. The battles scenes were incredible, they showed death and fighting just like a real war would be. The battles show flared emotions with dialog and action.<br/><br/>Even though the series was good I still had some problems with it. I felt there were skips in the battle that could have been cut out. Also some other were choppy and missing some detail or action. Overall I would want to see more of it, but I can call it excellent due to some minor flaws This series tells the story of Easy Company, of the US paratroopers that landed in Normandy, and tells it in such a raw, realistic fashion that you'll be hooked after just one episode. The men of Easy company are just your average soldiers, but the series will change how you define an average soldier. Easy company is confronted with countless obstacles on their long road to victory, and that is where i think they truly become a 'band of brothers'. The hardships of war and the raw emotional bonds that are form from them are things that will be remembered by all those involved, and this series puts much emphasis on that. A specific struggle focused on in episode "XXX" is that of the WW2 medic. Easy companies doc spends more time scrounging for supplies around the ranks than he does putting them to work. He is constantly out of morphine, bandages, and every other necessity of a medic, which makes his job ten times harder than it should be. Band of Brothers is an excellent movie. It follows the 101st airborne, easy company, across the whole war. From their training in the states and in england. To D-day, Operation Market Garden, the battle of the Bulge and every where in between. Following these men through out the war you see how they have banded together and have truly become brothers. You feel connected to them during the movie. The 101 airborne was the most tested and successful group of soldiers in the war.Band of Brothers is an excellent movie.

The 101 airborne was the most tested and successful group of soldiers in the war. in this movie i think it is like about how a group of brother who are solders and are like family because they are so tit i think in this movie it shows how this go over come so many this that get in there way and can deal with them after it happens i think that in med man that he gos thought so much and saves so many life and the other man depends on him to save there lifes it is kindy like they look up to him to keep him safe from any other threat to them i think that in this movies tis man are though some much that it because common to them about death and others thins like making sure man stay a live and i believes that the guys from the airborne make sure that all of there man do the right thin and make sure all man get back home safe in this movies i really think that when you look into the eyes of a man who gos thought so much and can live though like many of the man in this movie that they can be proud of what they did for making sure there war brothers made it home safe I've seen almost the entire series, and I am always very impressed by it. I know that since it is a series that sometimes it can be hard to do some of the cinematic work that they have in films, but all in all it is still a masterpiece. I' not exactly call it a "miniseries" since it is very long, and some times there are parts that are a little boring, but the episodes that are actually displaying battles are very impressive. The acting was alright, and even though it is hard to understand the characters beyond their single episodes or maybe 2 to 3 episodes if they are more important like the commander. In general, I wish television had more series like this one, and showed more realism than random junk. I like how in Band of Brothers its not trying to glorify what happens in war. I do like how the series is not about really each battle they are in but more about the soldiers and there struggles in the war and how each soldier is affected by it. Plus they gave the background of each character and who they were before the war. I think they showed what really happens in war, for example not everybody in your unit will survive and many of the characters died through the movie and you never really saw it coming. I liked that in every episode they show a different view of the war from a different soldier in the company. Overall it didn't seem like you were watching a TV series it felt more like a movie , Band of Brothers is a good series and i would watch it again. This series showed a lot of the events of WWII. It showed not only the important battles of the war but it showed what the life of a soldier was like. The series represented the confusion of an airdrop, drop zones, and how hard it was to fly an airplane under anti-aircraft fire. In episode six we were shown the war in the point of view of medic. We were shown how hard the life of a medic was, they had to check up on every soldier, make important operations on the battlefield under great pressure. Episode 2 showed how well the U.S. troops did taking out the guns and the strategy used. I thought that the series was very realistic especially the graphic images of the injuries. The actors did a great job of showing the feelings of a soldier in times of misery in the cold. I thought there was some biased in the film on how often the U.S. soldiers got hit with stray bullets which was one of the most frequent thing that happened in Saving Private Ryan. Overall I give this series a 10 out of 10 for being an exciting series and a realistic view of what the American soldiers wen through. This is one of the best, if not the best mini series ever made. A heartbreaking, funny, sad, intense, disgusting and realistic series makes you feel as if you are a soldier in the war. With each episode focusing on an individual soldier you get to know the characters very well and come to like them no matter the background or the the type of person. Be ready for some gore fighting. This series is incredibly realistic and the grousome aspects of war truly come out in the sights and sounds of each episode. Every time you see a dying soldier you can't help thinking about their family back home, if they had a wife, if they had a child and what sort of life they would miss. A terrible but necesary trueth that needs to be remembered just like the men of the war. This movie is the complete pacage. It incorporates sound sight and the aspects of war that must be experienced in order to know what war is really like. This mini series follows one group of men fighting in the world war 2. The first episode shows the soldiers dealing with landing during the night in Normandy and then kind of spontaneous regrouping in the middle of nowhere. There's many scenes from the battle field. A lot of action, and pressure. It shows the conditions the soldiers had to survive and they also didn't get that much food because they always had to move because of German's surprising attacks. The second episode shows us a different battle which is happening during very cold and snowy weather. The action in the second episode is focused on very important and hard work of medic. He always has to be close and be fast in helping all the guys. It is probably very hard for his psychical thinking because he watches all the injured soldiers and he needs to help them fast and as accurate as possible. This TV miniseries is amazing. The way they follow the medic to understand the need for supplies on the front line is well done. Also, the fight scene in part two was done well. The tactics were shown in a good way. The feelings of the men are displayed so that the viewer can be attached to the show. The cold winter is a big aspect to the second scene. The actors do a good job showing the cold and containing their emotions. One of them, the medic, is always running around, risking his life to save the injured man. He never stops running and working, even with the low amounts of supplies. It is a good scene demonstrating how men of all different races and religions can come together and fight to save each other. Even if the odds against are far greater. The men huddle together like brothers through the hard, cold nights. They are able to stop every enemy attack thrown at them. This is by far the best World War II depiction ever. The closest thing that compares to it is Saving Private Ryan, but even that cannot compare to the realism that this miniseries portrays. It follows a company of soldiers throughout the whole war, and it does this with a mastery that is both incredible and horrifying at the same time. After watching this series, I feel like I can identify with these heroes, who sacrificed their comfort and their lives so that we could stop the Germans. From their intense training, to their botched drops into Normandy, to the cold winter of, Bastogne, the soldiers are portrayed perfectly. Their hardships and their struggles can be felt by the viewer. There is intense gore, but that only adds to the realism and helps us have some idea of what the soldiers are feeling, even though we can never truly know how they felt. Band of Brothers is very realistically filmed and the acting quality is high. It follows the 101st airborne from Normandy, where they landed behind the beaches, all the way into Germany and the end of the war. Bastogne -- Battle of the Bulge -- is memorable. The unit of the 101st has honest & dishonest officers and brave and scared soldiers. Some Americans care about their men first, but some care only about themselves. The battle scenes are genuinely chaotic and scary. High ly recommended, all ten episodes. It is based on the book Band of Brothers by Seven Ambrose. Do not look for Normandy scenes such as landing on the beach because these soldiers parachuted behind the beaches into fields and hedgerows on the night before the beach landings (June 6, 1944). I'm surprised that none of these actors had careers in movies after this TV show came out in 2000, because they are all good and they look the part. I am not a fan of war films in general; I happened to watch the first episode by chance and literally got caught up with the drama.<br/><br/>To say 'Band of Brothers' is exceptional underestimates how powerful and moving this piece of work is. From the part one to part ten you feel the emotions of each person and experience some of the horror which these young men encountered (I am well aware that the true realities of war cannot be accurately expressed on film).<br/><br/>What makes this series even more powerful is that you get to hear Easy veterans discuss their experiences to the camera at the beginning of each episode, linking the past events to the present and allowing the viewer to realise that the events (and people) portrayed actually existed.<br/><br/>Yes, there are some flaws: Blithe did not die of his wounds in 1947, Hitler did not die so early on in April. But, these are minor when contemplating the quality of the entire piece.<br/><br/>The performance of all the actors were fantastic too. Particular stand outs for me: Damien Lewis, the leader and heart of E company as Maj. Winters, Ron Livingston as the cocky but sensitive Lewis Nixon and Shane Taylor was incredibly moving in his portrayal of Doc Roe in the powerful episode 6 Bastonge.<br/><br/>I have seen the entire series twice now. The more you watch the more you get to know all the members of Easy Company; they are all there in the background and also come forward in the main action. In doing so, you see new things in each episode and the emotional impact of the casualties and the fact that some survived are even more powerful.<br/><br/>Go see, this series is an important part of history; we must never forget the silent thousands who never returned from war and the many veterans who survived and must had been affected by their experiences.<br/><br/>We stand alone together. ...and the next I saw made me feel like a replacement.<br/><br/>Maybe a cryptic title, but it is meant as a complement.<br/><br/>I watched this when it aired on Danish television and I was hooked from the first second.<br/><br/>The atmosphere, the acting, the lingo, the costumes...everything was genius and innovative, and FAR better than Savign Private Ryan, as you here got an all around look into the battalion and the various stages of the war they entered.<br/><br/>As mentioned I missed an episode, and not just any episode. It was the second at Bastogne where they get the s... kicked out of them in the woods overlooking Foy. The next one I DID see was when Eion Bailey's character Webster returns from the hospital and gets treated like a replacement because he hadn't been at Foy.<br/><br/>I felt really the same way and all through that episode I was three steps behind the action.<br/><br/>That really makes a show great, when the way the viewer feels matches that of the characters.<br/><br/>My deepest respect for the men of Easy-Company and to Spielberg and Hanks for bringing us the best show on WWII EVER. Honestly this is the best series I've ever seen. Every episode in this series hit me deeply. I've always been a WWII history buff but never have I seen such a great first hand experience as I have with "Band of Brothers". The characters stay with you long after viewing the series. The actors portraying the soldiers are so believable that it's not hard to become addicted to the series. The acting is top notch on top of the real live accounts from the soldiers who lived "Band of Brothers". Effects are very well done and place you right on the front lines of WWII. The story could never be written by a writer. It'll leave you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. This is a series no one should ever go without seeing. This has got to be one of the best war movies/mini series of all times. The stunning camera work, the effects, the dialogue between the actors and the chemistry is very believable. The instructors Tom Hanks and David Frankel really pulled off a real masterpiece and i must admit, they are coming close to my all time favorite instructor, Steven Spielberg after watching this mini series. I gave it a 10/10 but in all modesty i think it should have gotten 15/10. Almost all of the actors have received awards for their performance so its hard to pick one out but if i had to i would have to pick Damian Lewis whom plays Maj. Richard D. Winters, the officer in the unit. His performance is one of the finest ever since Saving Private Ryan and Tom hanks performance. First of all i would like to say i think a big thank you needs to go out to the makers of this movie, my grand father was out fighting in the war and i never really quite appriciated how brave he was until i watched this film. Everyone out there fighting for us, in my eyes is one of the most heroic people that live today/ have lived. Thank you to all those brave soldiers, many whom lost their lives in doing so.<br/><br/>This is a great film, i highly recommend it to other. The graphic are superb. Fantastic story line, they have resembled it really well to how it must really have been. The actors fitted their characters well and done a great job.<br/><br/>Once again thank you. This series of DVD's is an absolute must for any good war movie collection, because its not a "war movie", as much as it is a dramatically realistic chronicle of Easy Company's fighting from the bootcamp training in Georgia, to the beaches on D-Day, across France, into Germany, and straight up to Hitler's "Eagle's Nest". Very cool stuff. Truly some of the best war footage(recreation) I've ever seen. Why am I just now commenting on this? (April 2008)... because I bought it a couple of years ago, and never had time to sit down and watch it. I broke it out last night, and literally could not stop. Watched all 8 (or 9?) DVD's (took a 5 hour break to sleep after #4, then finished the set Sat morning). I always felt that Saving Private Ryan set a new standard by which all other war films would be measured, until I saw this stuff -- wow. I realize Speilburg and Hanks worked on both, but this Band of Bros stuff is extraordinarily comprehensive, historically accurate, and amazingly realistic -just like SPR - and even more so. Lastly - I was extremely impressed with every single actor! There is not a weak one in the bunch. ...Go get it. This is quite simply the best television ever made. It is a poignant series, both thought provoking and emotive that is backed up by real life accounts from the surviving 'brothers'. There are apparently some details that are slightly changed but for the most part the stories are an accurate account. It begins at the airborne's inception and growth at toccoa, through to the end of the war and the last missions of the European campaign. If this was a piece of fiction it would be fantastic but the fact that the players are real and events true then it becomes so much better. The actors add real bite to their characters and do really portray their characters with pride. You really believe the friendships that were built amongst the chaps and what it meant to be in the war together and part of the paratroopers. I for one would welcome further series of this quality about other stories from the war. If you haven't seen the series then you must, take the time to sit through it. brilliant! This week is the third time I am watching "Band Of Brothers". It is a masterpiece of WWII movies, along with "Saving Private Ryan". Not even a thousand words of praise would be enough to show the greatness of this series. I wish I could go back in time and fight along with those men that sacrificed their lives on the battlefronts and should never be forgotten. The "BOB" gives the viewer, a strong sense of reality, of being there, feeling what the soldiers felt in those days, fear and courage. "Band Of Brothers" is a must have for any WWII movie fan. Believe me, you won't regret watching this.I don't know if someone will ever do something at least equal in value with this one. I wish there were more WWII movies made like "Saving Private Ryan" or "Band Of Brothers", or even close. But unfortunately, I don't know any. .... " " .... speechless.<br/><br/>This series has to be seen to be believed. It is that excellent. Amazing. Adjectives aren't enough to describe how truly brilliant and gripping this is.<br/><br/>The fact this series is based on real life events only emphasises the true horror that was the second world war. It absolutely *MUST* be seen by everyone; the charachterisation, the true to life violence of the scenes, the flow of the "story" is perfect. At times it made me cry.<br/><br/>The actors honour the memories of the soldiers that fought for our lives, in the greatest story of human hardship in history.<br/><br/>Life in the second world war has never been been told this way before. this is the best and most honest show that has ever graced our screens.<br/><br/>If you've not seen it buy it. Now.<br/><br/>For those that have seen it are : "We lucky few, we band of brothers." 11/10, it is one better! Perfect! Timeless Classic! <br/><br/>Greatest war based TV series, mini series, film ever. This will appeal to viewers of all tastes as is so much more than just war action. The $125 million budget means no expense spared so looks as good as any big budget film.<br/><br/>The action scenes are excellent & provide a really good mix of WWII. The acting is top notch especially Damian Lewis. I really liked the way they developed the characters over the episodes too. The fact it is a true story & the real life characters were part of the process adds to authenticity.<br/><br/>To me episode 2 is the star starting with D-Day Landings & it is very difficult to stop watching then.<br/><br/>The DVD box set is really cheap now & will be watched for years to come. If you have not seen before you are in for a real treat.<br/><br/>'The Pacific' due to 2009? Can it match such high standards? Got this for Christmas, and have already watched it. I thought it was absolutely fantastic, It was a great ensemble drama, not just focusing on one person. But for me Damian Lewis was the best standout actor in the series. I was a bit wary at first because Damian Lewis was the only person I had heard of in the cast of 'unknowns' but I recognised some faces. But that didn't really matter, because I thought it was a very good emotional thrill ride! Great battle scenes, glad that Spielberg and Tom hooked up to do this,can't wait for the other band of brothers series to come out. Its been slated for 2008 and its called 'the pacific'. No other mini-series drew me in the way this one did. Having just read the book by Stephen Ambrose, I was able to fill in the gaps left by the filmmakers. To their credit, they went for the meat and potatoes (the most important stuff) and skipped the Brussels sprouts. This made for tighter storytelling. The performances were uniformly great, although there were a few too many characters to try to keep track of (especially for someone who hadn't read the book). If you buy the DVD, I recommend you go to the "information center" to get the names (and faces) of the characters before you watch an episode. Also recommended: the disc that features the survivors themselves recounting their experiences. From the first note, the music draws you in and you know that this is going to be something special. You get to know the characters along the way, which makes their fate heart-wrenching. I highly recommend that anyone interested in World War Two check out BAND OF BROTHERS. Band of Brothers is one of those rare occurrences in television. The power house that is Spielberg and Hanks bring us another war epic. First let me say that you should read "Band of Brothers" then read "Beyond Band of Brothers: The Memoirs of Maj. Dick Winters", then watch the miniseries and you will get an incredibly true story that will blow you away. The characters are engrossing, and by the end of the saga you will want more thats why I suggest reading the books first. Though there are some inaccuracies which is expected. Though it will not matter. The violence is extreme as well as the language. Just face it people talk like that and war violence is far far worse. The violence is not so hard to stomach it is just hard watching some of the characters you grow to love die. I suggest this to anyone that is a WW2 buff and to anyone that just wants to know what it was like at a time when the world was growing dark with tyranny. This is a true story of survival, brotherhood, and courage. Watch it. Love it. Live it. There is not much more to say as the title above says all! I am astonished from every aspect of this series. Environment was perfect, special effects the same, characters and actors outstanding and it was also, as far as I know, historically accurate...Many scenes were so emotionally charged that you actually want to start crying... This is definitely a MUST TO SEE!!! Even if you're not interested in the war, I think you will find the series satisfying. And if you're interested in such films, go and buy the DVD because you will definitely want to watch it at least a second time! Excellent, astonishing, unique, outstanding!! Fantastic, emotional ride. Here we follow the lives of some of the men that defended not only our country, but the world from evil. WWII is slowly being forgotten, hence the number of movies recently showing us this time. I usually prefer the 50's and 60's movies about the war. This one however holds it's own.<br/><br/>If you have any interest in WWII this is definitely a must see. Great performances by the entire, huge, cast. Infront of and behind the camera. Just make sure you have the time, this mini-series is long. But more then worth while.<br/><br/>Absolutely a 9 out of 10.<br/><br/>Eyan Chenier I've just finished watching this and I have to say it is one of the most believable and touching war stories I've ever seen! The story was based on actual accounts from people who were there and it's not as glorified as some war films out there. Everyone was taught about the World Wars but after this film I understood the effects it had on the soldiers. My favourite part would have to be when you find out the type of people the soldiers went onto be and how their lives turned out! The discovery of the concentration camp effected me the most and it was hard to watch but I'm glad I did because I will never think of World War 2 in the same way. Being a teen myself and seeing this series for the first time this year, I found my self surprised to find how engaged I was in it. The acting is the real hook of this mini-series. I especially liked Donnie Wahlberg as Carwood Lipton. The interviews of the real veterans themselves are heart-wrenching and help the viewer try to begin to comprehend that this really happened to these men. Another thing that really grabbed me was the use of colour throughout the series (greens, grays, and browns). I kept it somehow more real and kept me from thinking of this as just another war movie. It added grit and a sense of reality. The character development is also something to be considered. The in-depth analysis of these men, again, makes the series more realistic in the fact that they had real feelings and problems and fears as everyone else. I absolutely loved this mini-series and I'm starting it over. I've watched "Carentan" three times now and I'm still not weary of it and I doubt I ever will tire of seeing this excellent series. As a Marine Corps era veteran, I rate this movie as about as real as it gets, and military moral exactly what every soldier feels regarding commanding officers and the politics of war. WWII was the last war America fought where we were in it to win...killing more of the enemy and causing more morale busting terror than we had inflicted on us. Can't say that about the "politically correct" way we have fought wars since. War is absolute fear and hell as BOB portrays. Our politicians don't seem to "get it"...we can't shoot at specific targets even when we are receiving fire (Mosques, schools, hospitals, ambulances). Well, BOB tells it like it is and I hope one day to personally shake the hand of Captain Winters...one of the many remarkable heroes who insured the freedom we Americans enjoy...and to which so many spoiled Americans (as well as most free citizens of the world)do not appreciate, and will never understand. By the way, the acting was superb, the cinematography unbelievable, and the musical score very appropriate. I have watched the BAND OF BROTHERS several times since its introduction and in my opinion this is the best dramatization of American soldiers in any war. For all the combat scenes, all the action, the camaraderie exhibited by these soldiers underscores the main theme of this series title, and to me that is the most important element of this story. I have know many men such as these and when the elder veteran Don Malarkey becomes visibly emotional as he describes his after-war feelings at the beginning of "The Breaking Point", I find myself breaking down with him. I love the men of Easy Company as I love the "BAND OF BROTHERS". When I first saw this series I thought, OK this is really good stuff. 2 years later a get interested in this series again and bought the DVD. I don't know why but something hits me like a bomb. The whole cast did a remarkable job. Great directors, cinematographers and an excellent crew make this series an unforgettable masterpiece. To know that this stories are the memories of the soldiers of Easy Company makes this series even more interesting. Although a little changed to fit in a movie, the story is realistic and tries to stick to the story told by the real men of Easy Company the whole time. I'm from Austria and have to say it's a totally American view of the whole situation, but that's how the boys felt, and watching them give a small taste of being in a band of brothers, being in a group of persons in extraordinary situations in cruel times, cruel times which changes the whole world dramatically, cruel times leaving non one unaffected. When I saw "Band of brothers" for the first time I was astonished. When I saw all of the miniseries again I was shaken. I really like the story. The characters are so color... They were so different people and that miniseries show us it very well. Very good cast. Damian Lewis, Donnie Wahlberg, Ron Livingston, Matthew Settle and all of the others actors are really good choice for BoB. I'm very sorry that I saw it too late. I mean that now is 2007... I've never thought that I'll like some kind of movie for WWII. It's amazing but I love it!!! BoB is the best!!! Good work Tom! Good work Steven!!! I want more ... and more! Everything in "Band of brothers" is amazing! Everything! Very well done and almost as realistic as "Saving Private Ryan", also done by Tom Hanks. I have watched the entire series 3 times and cannot wait to watch it again soon. I did not hesitate to spend the $110 for the DVD set so I have it forever. Episode 2 leading up to and following the brothers into their first battle at Normandy was intense. I found myself ducking from bullets. I felt I was almost part of Easy Company and friends of each of the long timers. The battle scenes showed the personal side as well as the ferocity. It was well acted, well produced and well supported with money to make it real. Great job Tom, your father and all vets should be proud. This is the only miniseries or film I've ever given a 10 to and I would have given it an 11 if I could have. It is so far and above anything else I've ever seen.<br/><br/>The storytelling is magnificent, the acting is superb, the violence and action gut-wrenching, and the meticulous attention to detail breathtaking. The only complaint anyone could lodge against it is that it engages in a large amount of hero worship. But not even that can be a knock against this work...because when you're telling a story about true heroes, men who literally walked through hell to do what they considered the right thing, what else is one to do? My great uncle was a combat engineer in Italy in WWII. He never talked about what he saw or did. Partly, I think, because it was too horrific to recount, and partly also, because he knew he could never get us to understand what it was really like. Bless everyone involved for showing me what it was like, and giving me some idea of what that part of my great uncle's life was like.<br/><br/>Everyone who's ever protested a war or thought that we should fight in one, which is probably all of us in this day and age, should see it. All the reasons to fight and not to fight are there, depicted in sharp, vibrant detail. Please Please watch this. If you even think you might want to watch this do so and grab this and watch Band of Brothers. You wont regret it. I myself am not a person to watch a movie over and over again but this one I have seen about eight times now. I hope you take the time to see this wonderful and deserving two thumbs up movie/HBO series. If your looking for a long movie where you get to feel like your in the movie and begin to feel as if you know the characters one by one as the story unfolds then this is a movie for you. If I could give the rating more then a 10 I would. I remind you I am a very harsh critic. Not many movies are out there anymore as deserving as Band of Brothers is. Band of Brothers is really a corkingly brilliant mini-series. It is truly epic - each episode is something you would expect to see in a cinema, not on TV. Though the last few episodes start to dwindle on the action front, that doesn't matter - Band of Brothers isn't meant to be just full-on action, it is meant to explain the horrors and reality of war in a way that will bring you back to the 1944 Normandy invasion. The battles of Bastogne are truly the best bits of the whole mini-series, and bring out the best in every aspect of the series. Great special effects in the form of a hugely convincing-looking forest and lots of fake snow, lots of boredom and troubles of war, such as men talking in their foxholes in horrible conditions and unpredicted mortar attacks are the things that make this mini-series a truly troubling and realistic depiction of a battle that shaped the Second World War. Nobody can even imagine what it must have been like to fight in Bastogne (many say it was the hardest part of the war to live through) but Band of Brothers brings us as close to the truths of that situation as we could ever hope (or try) to get. The action scenes, though on a substantially smaller scale than Saving Private Ryan, are probably the most intense scenes ever televised, and are easily as realistic and well-done as SPR. "Day of Days" is a great episode that tells us that the war was hard right from the very start. It offered us several things SPR didn't, including the actual drop into Normandy, brought to the screen by means of stunning special effects and lots of noise. "Currahee" could have been missed out from the series, but it was actually very important to BoB - the men training for the great war. Though the American army camp lacks the horrible and humiliating edge like the one in Jarhead, it is stunningly recreated and just as truthful (contraband items in the recruits' dormitory, long, hard training and harsh punishments). But at that stage, nobody knew what was going to happen in years to come - they most certainly didn't know that they were going to need each other so much during their war. Episode 9 "Why We Fight" had the thing that Schindler's List needed most - the liberation of a death camp. When the American soldiers arrive at the camp, we are thrown into the most sickening part of the whole mini-series. Recapturing the horrible conditions of these evil places and the appearances and emotions of the prisoners perfectly, Why We Fight more than made up for its hugely-unnecessary sex scene at the start and put us as close to the horrors of the Jews' suffering as nothing else has done yet. Band of Brothers is not meant to be all gore, it is meant to be full of truth. "Points" taught me lots of new things - one of them being that recruits actually had to earn their deportation home - and the series never passes on the gore, blood, sweat, tears, shouting, swearing, guns and horror. Nobody will ever know everything about the war - it was something that nobody really understood but lived by one universal rule - you had to get used to it. Band of Brothers is something that we can all learn more about WWII from. It is lavishly made and written, and seeing as it is going off cheap in certain DVD shops at the moment, you must buy it if you get the chance. You really don't know what you're missing. 10/10 Put simply, "Band of Brothers" is the best thing I have seen on TV, EVER! It is now my favorite DVD set. A compelling story, well told, beautifully filmed, acted and directed in a style reminiscent of "Saving Private Ryan"; here is a history of East Company, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division, the U.S. Army's "Best Of The Best", with real insights into leadership, courage and camaraderie. David Schwimmer's portrayal of the martinet Captain Sobel (a personality type referred to in the military simply as "Chicken $#!%") provides a perfect foil for Damien Lewis, as the heroic and compassionate Richard Winters, a role model for anyone who aspires to lead others. Viewers also meet the real life members of Easy Company via introductions to the episodes, which somehow make these larger-than-life characters very human and their heroism all the more poignant. Perhaps the most important thing I learned from "Band of Brothers" is that real heroes do not call attention to themselves, or even consider themselves heroic. Their heroes are their brothers in arms who did not return from war and the families whose loved ones' lives were lost. I love war movies; the oldies (Kelly's Heroes - e.g.) and new ones (Black Hawk Down - e.g.) as well. Band of Brothers is just simply the best I've ever seen. There's nothing to add. Step on "true story" field is risky, but this crew did it excellent, better than any crew before. Using the original book and their own ideas, the structure of each episode - interviewing the real persons/heroes e.g. - is brilliant. The cast was just perfect. (Damian Lewis as R. Winters is the king of my heart.) These actors were the real flash and bone characters from Easy Co. Usually I sit down and watch all 10 episodes, because I can't stop. And I always cry at the end of Episode 10, when Richard Winters quote his grandpa's letter.<br/><br/>Directors, editors and the whole crew needs to be praised for making this series. Cinematography and coloring are outstanding. Music is also unforgettable, matching to the film so much and add extra value to its atmosphere - thank you, Michael Kamen and R.I.P. Not original scores were also selected brilliantly - listen to Episode 9, Camp scene e.g. Band of Brothers is excellent in all its elements. This is an all-time masterpiece. I would like to thank Mr. Spielberg, Mr. Hanks and HBO for this monumental venture. Band of Brothers is a true masterpiece.<br/><br/>There is no better way to describe the best mini series of all time, than starting by giving it top grade and saluting it.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg, Erik Jendresen, and all the others involved in script and filming have shown the world of Hollywood, how to make war controlled and catching to watch.<br/><br/>I have never in my life seen any series that I couldn't stop watching until i was done. When You've seen first episode, you just need to watch the next.. and the next, and when its over.. you beg the screen for more.<br/><br/>The casting of the actors was done after studying the real characters, combined with the real actors help throughout stories and more.<br/><br/>A perfect example on the perfect casting, is Frank John Hughes as Bill Guarnere. The resemblance is remarkable.<br/><br/>Ron Livingston who plays Lewis Nixon made a video diary for the DVD box, in which we see all them actors going through a 10 day boot camp, before the filming.<br/><br/>No words is enough, just go and see this! Buy the DVD!!! BUY IT!.<br/><br/>It doesn't matter if its price is 50000Â€ .. Its worth it!! BUY IT The Band of Brothers mini series is without a doubt one of if not the best mini-series I have ever seen for the following reasons. The mini-series is foremost faithful to the journey of Easy company and is one of the most historically correct recollections of WW2 experiences i have seen. The shooting, special effects and finish of the series gives the audience the feel of being right in the mist of the action. (A similarity to Saving Private Ryan). The writing is excellent with satisfactory weight given both to the plot (over story) and character development. The audience gets to know and care about many of the main characters, and others that wander in and out of the story. <br/><br/>We emphasise with the struggles of the men, war-torn and traumatised and come to realise without a doubt that even those men who returned home alive did not return unscathed. Most importantly the Band of Brothers although a story of war is ultimately about the men of Easy company. This is the driving force behind the series, how a company of soldiers became a company of friends/brothers. It truly echoes sentiments retold by veterans of WW2 that they fought not for themselves but for each other. The series Band of brothers made me think about the awful time those men most have had! But also to the great friendship that they've got! I think it is a very realistic series and I think it gave people a good impression about the time those soldiers from the easy company had! Episode 6 'Bastogne' was for me so impressive that I want to be a medic myself! And the great actor Damian Lewis representing Dick Richard Winters translate his character very good if you ask me! I feel like I'm really into the place where they are and I can feel the tension of the soldiers! I think it is really a great series and definitely the best war movie I've ever seen! Most because of the realistic type of filming and of course the filters that are used to make it look older and more gloomy. When my neighbour asked if i wanted to borrow Band of Brothers I did but I didn't know what to expect and i was just hoping that it would be good. When i began watching Band of Brothers i couldn't stop and i was immediately intreaged by how well developed and unique the characters were. I never really knew much about the war but watching this opened me up to all of the hardships involved. When i realised that this series was drawn from soldiers' journals and letters and from interviews with the men themselves i was astonished. I just absolutely love this series and recommend everyone to watch it!!! 10 OUT OF 10!!!! (no doubt about it) This series is a great portrayal of what happened to these men in Easy Company. It really showed the hardships and sacrifices they had to endure in a great way. They did not make the film into one of those "guts and glory" war films. They made it into a historically accurate show. They also tried to keep things in the series as original as possible for the production. It was also put together in such a way that it really takes you on an emotional roller-coaster ride.<br/><br/>The production did not do a half asked job when it needed to be done, and it shows. Most mini series I can't even watch they are so cruddy. This one breaks the mold when it came to plot and great acting.<br/><br/>I would like to send a shout out thank you to the production people for doing this story right and not turning it into something trivial to watch.<br/><br/>I would also like to thank the real solders this story is based upon. For without them making the sacrifices that they did we could be living in a very different much more bleak world then we do today. We can never thank these people enough for what they did. Even though we can not I would still like to say thanks again for their wonderful bravery and courage that they displayed during what was a very grueling time. I wish them all the best. The History Channel did a great service of airing "Band of Brothers" over the past week.I dedicated my time from 8:00 p.m. to around 10:15 p.m. every night to watch this captivating,heartbreaking yet still somehow uplifting miniseries. And I have to say the series impacted me so that I feel emotional drained. Over 600 minutes, the series brings you along the journey of the men in boot camp to their chaotic jump into Normandy on D-Day. The battles that follow have you sitting on the edge of your seat, biting your fingernails, squirming in anxiety while you scream "GET DOWN! STAY COVERED! OH GOD JUST RETREAT!" at the screen. Men come and men go. Men die quick deaths. Men die slow, agonizing deaths. Men are wounded. But most importantly is that men live. Men live 435 (or around there) days since the drop in Normandy. The connections, the brotherhood between these men separates this from most movies/TV series/novels dealing with WWII. The fact that you begin to care for these men, relate to them, empathize and struggle along side them. This is what will carry the memories of this series with me through the rest of my life. This is what will make me have the utmost respect for all men, no matter what nationality, that served in war. The speech during part 10 made by the German commander to his troops, a speech that could so easily apply to the men of Easy Company, is the final hard emotional blow. Just try to wrap your head around that scene...<br/><br/>I don't care how hard you are, this miniseries is sure to make shed a few tears, let a few laughs (courtesy Rick Gomez as Luz) and change the way you view the world, even if not for a few days. What a series! The way this series is shot and presented makes you feel as though you are right alongside Easy Company. The added touch of interviews with real war veterans not only increases your understanding of what these men must have gone through but gives the whole series a emotional base which is rarely seen with this genre.<br/><br/>From the outset you see these young men going through their training and as the series progresses through the war you can see their development into the soldiers that will be shaping history.<br/><br/>The casting and performances from everyone involved were outstanding, from the uneasy and wary Pte. Blithe to the more battle hardened soldiers, showing the whole scope of the reality of war, and not just glorified action sequences.<br/><br/>All in all one of the best things to hit the TV, and one of the highest ratings i have seen. Would have been nice to see a cameo from Hanks though.... I'M WRITING ABOUT THE EPISODES SO HERE ARE ONLY SPOILERS: I HOPE THE PRODUCERS ARE IN THE KNOW ABOUT THE MASSACRE OF THE BAND OF BROTHERS THEY MADE ON THE Italian BROADCAST BY MEDIASET!<br/><br/>First of all the female in charge of the Italian translation evidently does not know anything about military terms, and I presume English language as well: all the series is distorted to a point the US soldiers sound (thanks to the translators) and look (thanks to the arbitrary cuts) as a bunch of idiots, in the more stereotyped way the military are considered: e.g. the plain word 'Nuts' so anti-rhetoric should have been translated in Italian as 'Balle', which is also a common use for 'words without any relation to Truth', etc. but instead it's translated as 'colcavolo' (lit: 'with cauliflower') that has 'COLCAVOLO' any useful meaning here, except introduce us to the misleading work done, I suspect with subtler intentions; afterwards, to continue with this example, in the original you can hear the voices of the filthy and heroic soldiers commenting in appreciation 'Nuts' for the General so far from rhetoric; in the Italian track you'll hear 'Viva l'America!', as if Pancho Villa is riding again on his white horse, and no s**t (I apologize for the rudeness)... There are countless cases like this, or sometimes less serious: the General comments to Maj. Winters 'so they took away your company to become Battalion XO' in Italian sounds like 'you have been assigned to THE battalion XO' a mysterious unit you'd never heard of; 'the order 'Covering Fire!' whispered by Winters to the MG crew becomes 'There is fire to extinguish!'; the discussion between Webster and Liebgott after the shooting of the presumed nazi on the alps, becomes a kind of apology 'western style': yeah, that was a nazi! The good nazi is only the dead one! etc. or something similar; no mention about the real discussion they had in the original! And we'll not speak about the dialogue, quite funny, between the British soldier dressed as a German soldier, and Hoobler trying to snatch his luger: the scene was just cut off... maybe they realized they were UNABLE to translate the slang, or quite possibly they were unable to get the meaning of any word! It's a real shame they made cuts for about TEN minutes on EACH episode, so to fit the ads in one hour show, I presume: e.g. you'll lose all the beginning of the Hagenau episode, with Webster coming back, up to the point when they are dodging mortar shells to go to the Platoon; eventually you're able to not even note the fact in the end when Webster is helped up on the truck by a friendly hand: who cares if there was a scripting, a director and an editor with a shots' list, beside the hundreds who worked hard to realize a scene and give it a meaning...? It's a pity they also cut off scene like when Toye gives a lenghty list of all the equipment before the jump: no words there had any possible meaning for them; maybe the translators were not paid in full, or possibly they were over payed, who knows? Luckily I'd saw the series already before coming to Italy, beside having read the book. If I were HBO or the Producers, I'd sue the Italian distributors... And sorry for the Lenght! But if you need more details, let me know! I'm not sure what the Italian DVD edition contains: I own only the English language one! Never have I seen such an excellent TV series about the Second World War. It not only tells us an extraordinary story of bravery, courage and brotherhood but also it has extraordinary performances. I do not know which one to choose because all the actors are excellent but if I had to choose one Donnie Wahlberg would be my election. Apart from being an interesting real story of men fighting against the cruel domination of Europe by the Nazis, it is very well filmed and played by all the actors. The characters are also very human and show us extraordinary well, the pain and suffer of those who gave their lives for the freedom of Europe. This is why I would recommend everybody to watch it, whether they are interested or not in our history. So well directed and compulsive viewing. My father passed away recently and was a officer in the RAF. Recently he had opened up as to what life was really like in the forces. Including being tortured in Malaya. This film made my family realise the frustrations, fears, bonding and terror all suffered during the war.<br/><br/>My heart raced I cried and all I kept thinking is this really happened. The most compelling moment was when the company discovered the concentration camp. I looked across at my husband and 14 year old daughter sat next to each other on the sofa, like myself they were both crying.thank you to all the soldiers and film crew. The true story of the greatest generation, it shows what being a true hero is all about, best summed up by the Mike Ranney comment to his grandson when as if he had been a hero in the war, the answer, "No but I served in a company of heroes" <br/><br/>This unit had the highest casualty rate of any unit in the eto, over 150%, and there are now only 37 "Taccoa" men left. If you feel that Dick Winters should have go the Medal of Honor in 1944 the go to www.majordickwinters.com and sign the on line petition. As the Major would say Hang Tough.<br/><br/>These ordinary men did extraordinary things when asked to, they did not flinch, but bleed for our freedom and liberty. Having been born in the middle of WWII, I was raised in its aftermath. An uncle had been killed at Monte Cassino in 1944. There were war movies throughout my childhood. The shy, sensitive type, I didn't like most of them. The years went by, through to 1994 and 1995, when I visited Normandy. One sees all those graves. Near the cemetery is the town of Bayeaux, where twice I saw the long tapestry depicting William the Conqueror's (1066) invasion of England, which, of course, was in the opposite direction. I mean, you can't make this stuff up! <br/><br/>Fast-forward to November 2005, when I attended the World War II Veterans Committee Conference in Washington DC, where, for a couple of days and nights, I hung with some of the brave ones, including one or two mentioned in the "Band of Brothers". <br/><br/>I was glued to every episode of the "Band of Brothers". Much of my interest was absorbed in how well, and credibly, it was done. Like "Sergeant Ryan", it blew away all previous attempts to film World War II. Finally, It really looked somewhat like the hell that General Sherman had said it was. Yet this was not anti-war, which has been another mistake movie makers have made. This was more like how it really was. <br/><br/>I applaud the producers and directors for finally treating an American) audience like mature, thoughtful human beings. For a change. I can't get my hands down. This TV-series are just perfect. Great acting from non-Hollywood actors, great history, great effects..it is just perfect...i have seen this series like...20 times now and it just gets better! Every actor does a great job. I've never cry when i see a movie but in episode 9..sweet Jesus..just watch it. <br/><br/>I can't say anything bad about this. I just can't. It's a rush from start to end. Every episode is like Saving Privat Ryan times 10! <br/><br/>Everything just fit right in. It never gets boring. A very cool thing is that every episode has focus on a special person so one really gets to know them very well and therefore feel all their pain on the battlefield<br/><br/>Do you self a favor and buy the whole series! This is the best war series, for not to say best series, ever made!! If ever created a more outstanding television show, or film for that matter, sharing such a debut on the hardships, loyalties and heroic adventures of the WWII paratroopers as captivated by the HBO mini series, Band of Brothers, you can call me up and I'll be sure to convince you else wise.<br/><br/>Never have I found myself so intensely struck by the impact; so intrigued and entertained by the story or so deeply moved by the heart and foundation of any other production such as this one. You may prepare yourself to suffer and grow with these men, experiencing the most wonderfully told combat story in the history of film-making. <br/><br/>As the young soldiers of Easy Company pass thru the toughest training out there to proudly serve in the army as Americas paratroopers, what lies ahead of them on D-day would only be the beginning of an experience which would put there lives at stake every second of the way. In fear of never again returning to home to there loved ones, and love forwards their fellow companions (some whom they shall never see again) they end up create a family of there own...<br/><br/>Band of Brothers not only stands true to every last detail, incorporating bits of the story as told by some of the actual veterans, but brings it to life with outstanding special effects that will literally blow you away. You won't need to watch this series in a premiere theater to take it to its full. Trust me.<br/><br/>So gather up your parachutes, and prepare to leap in to a world you never have imagined before, brought to our own eyes and hearts, of one of the most devastating wars in history. The bonds created in this band of brothers could never be told differently.<br/><br/>Sincerely, Seth Rodgers I think this series is just great! i usually don't like this type of movie genres but have to say I loved it. I loved it when I first watched it on VHS and I am watching it all over again on DVD. Just great...<br/><br/>I am not a movie specialist and I don't even understand about it but just watching at the images... at the actors it is just a plain 10! And as regards Jimmy Fallon, yes it was a bit odd to see him act there but anyway he had like a 5-minute part and David Schwimmer (or however you spell it), I just couldn't get rid of that Ross image in my head but he acted well, I think Band of Brothers is a masterpiece. I am a Canadian citizen and believe that everyone show watch this mini series as it is a great account of what many brave and fearless young men did to protect our parents and therefore protect all of us during Worl war II.<br/><br/>If anyone today was to watch this film and decide that he/she should even consider another war with anybody they obviously did not watch "Band of Brothers".<br/><br/>I am a big fan of "A Bridge Too Far" as well as a minor fan of "Saving Private Ryan" this is way ahead of both of those films. This in part is due to the running time of the film, as we can fully see true "character" development(pun intended). We see the true growth of the individuals throughout this film.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed knowing the contributions of the men who did some of the introductory scenes to the segments.<br/><br/>All said, watch this film, it is not as long as it seems and you will definitely watch it over and over again. I am now on my 12th time viewing it, the film never becomes stale or routine. I think Band of Brothers is the best mini-series ever produced for T.V. My son and I watched it when it first came out on HBO, then I bought the DVD set. I've watched it several times now and each time I get to know the actors and their roles more, and the horrors that the men of Easy Co. went through. My hats off to Spielberg and Hanks for producing such a fantastic series. I might add that my favorite character is Carwood Lipton. He showed leadership and calmness when needed, and kept the men together under the worse conditions. In the last episode, "Points", Major Winters does not mention what Bill Guerneure, Joe Toye, or Don Malarkey did after the war. I thought it should of been added to the scene. By the way, at the end of "Points" when Major Winters is narrating what the guys did after the war, he DID NOT say that Frank Perconte died in 1998. He said he went back home to work his mail route. Only Doc Roe and George Luz died in 1998. In the goofs section, it stated he said Perconte died. After having seen so many movies and series, very rarely I get excited about them. But this is the most prominent exception I recall. Ten out of ten for Band of Brothers simply isn't enough.<br/><br/>How can one even start to describe this monumental achievement. It's Spielberg (and Hanks) best work to date, better than Schindler and Ryan combined. Actually here's the deal: Band of Brothers is better than any war movie ever made and sets the standard for decades to come.<br/><br/>The direction is so classy and realistic you will pinch yourself you have such quality before your own eyes. The acting is superb. The casting is spot-on. The script makes Ambrose's book flow smoothly and comprehensively. The costumes and the settings are accurate to the minute detail. The audiovisual effects are fabulous. The cinematography is astonishing. And the list goes on and on.<br/><br/>The full endorsement of the actual Easy Company says it all.<br/><br/>Consider yourselves lucky you have the opportunity to get this on DVD. I guarantee it will be the best purchase you have ever made.<br/><br/>P.S. Although I have rated this a 10/10, because it's cinema after all, I must say that Band is not factually correct in certain cases. Most notably these guys were NOT the first paratroopers in the world, as so many times we hear in this series. The Germans and the Brits were doing that years before them. why cant all war movies be like this ! historically accurate, bar the lack of British :) , get a good overview of life on the front line and what goes on in between. Pretty much no love interests that tend to clutter up these movies in order to pull more viewers (a personal gripe of mine).<br/><br/>on the back of "band of brothers" i have read almost everything Steven Ambrose has written !!! Ambrose has a remarkable insight and has done so much research on WWII - i urge anyone who is interested in Band of Brothers to read other books from his WW II series - absolutely amazing stuff. I had read the book Band of Brothers, and had read it over and over again with great interest. Now I have finally watched the entire series, and am thankful for it. This powerful non-fic starts with E company's training, to their landings in D-day and finally into Germany itself. Every word, every sentence, every joke has been painfully checked and corrected by those who did the real landings and were in the real company. And I must say, it did show. This is a powerful series and a must have for any fanatics of powerful masterpieces and non-fiction. The only thing that I really didn't like about it is that some parts were cut out from the book, which was disappointing as they were quite funny. (After Cpt. Nixon got his dirty hands on the wine cellar, he had a really bad sleep!) Even so, it's far worth watching and stands as one of the best presentations of War of all time. This story is without a doubt one of the best mini series I have ever seen. I've watched Saving Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down, Thin Red Line, and I have to say that this one is as good or maybe better then these other ones listed. The action is more intense then Thin Red Line, has more character study then Saving Private Ryan, and is full of more drama then All three combined. Not to say that these three films aren't good, they're all amazing in and of themselves, but Band of Brothers is up there with the rest of them.<br/><br/>The most interesting characteristic of this series is not the action altogether, it is the development of the characters themselves. We watch them as they get their baptism of fire and how they deal with that, and follow them through the hellhole of occupied Europe all the way to Victory. We witness the individual affects of Bastogne's intense artillery barrage's and the horror's seen firsthand in a liberated concentration camp. By the way, this in particular is an incredible piece of film making. Watching it with friends, the women were crying openly and the men were trying to hold back tears. It is that powerful. As a whole, the series is incredible, each episode is filled with enough combat for men to enjoy and enough drama to attract both the young and old alike. I recommend it for anyone who is trying to find an excellent mini series or film. Buy the DVD collection, it's worth it. I have always respected the men and women who fight for our country, and this movie only reinforces it. Be prepared to witness some intense gore too. This series portrays the realities of combat in full view, so be prepared. Also get ready for intense drama and an abundance of moving, heartfelt moments in each of the episodes. The actors did an excellent job in portraying their real life counterparts, nice job to the casting department. Buy it, trust me 10/10 best war drama ever filmed. when i saw that i had a felling that i'm with 101 airborne in Normandy and Bastogne. i know lot about American airborne in second world war. episode Bastogne is like William Wellman battleground but i think that is not better than 1949 classic. for me is best episode Carentan. never seen better digital camera work. actors are all good but Damian Lewis as Winters and Matthew Settle as Speirs are little better that others. Beautiful music by Michael Kamen. American Film Academy may have bring a new category for Oscar. Best TV Movie and get Oscar to Band Of Brothers. Better than Saving Private Ryan. This Is I think the best piece of film I have ever seen. I received the boxset for Hanukah and have already watched it 2 times. When I saw the length of the mini series I said to myself this must be sooo drawn out. I was on the edge of my couch every second. The pyrotechnics(sp?) are freaking amazing. By Part 5 you feel like you know each and every soldier like you are best friends. I would recommend this mini series to anyone who like war movies. If you think Saving Private Ryan was good, multiply that by 10, and then you will have BoB. I wish IMDb would let mini series into the top 250, because BoB would be number 1 with the highest rating on IMDb ever. And if you look closely in part 5, you might see a cameo by a director *cough cough* I am usually not a fan of all the overly patriotic war movies out there,but I have to say that Band of Brothers is one of the best productions ever made that deal with war, if not the best. The acting is perfect, the cast couldn't have been chosen better, the direction is faultless and every theme is clear. It is a great tribute to the efforts the soldiers made and truly made me appreciate those who fought for our countries. It further contributed to my comprehension of why war is sometimes and inevitably necessary. My father was a fan and talked me into watching the DVD's. I am glad I was bored that day -I finished the 15-hour package in 3 days. Definitely a must see! i never really got to see band of brothers when it first came out in 2001 on HBO. But while i was watching TV all i see on history channel that band of brothers is gonna be on so i like cool. So i watched it from start to finish it was awesome. from watching that episode Crossroads i bought the DVD set and what a good decision. its a must buy if your into the WWII stuff. From the acting visuals and the intensity in the game is great. and i like how they made it into a 10 part series. which made it just as good not like movies you watch 2 hours and its over. this scretches out the story out very well with like 2 major battles in the first 9 which is really good. so its a must see if you loves saving private Ryan which also was amazing. and also if you do by the set watch Ron Livingstone's video dairy its jokes. I see them in the market or driving down the road or in nursing homes. Gray haired old men in the autumn of their years. And I wonder  do they carry memories of times like those shown so compellingly in BoB? Were they there? Would they tell me what they saw? Could they? I mean, how can someone like me ever grasp these experiences? Sadly, so many are gone and soon there will be no more. We need to understand that these old men were once young men, often boys, who helped save the world. The fact that they could return from war, live their lives, raise families, and tolerate civilians and coming generations ignorant or unappreciative of their sacrifice, is in some ways as amazing as what they did in the war.<br/><br/>Kudos to BoB for telling the story that so many experienced. From a distance of sixty years it is hard to grasp that such a monumental event in history was real. But it happened. BoB shows that as well as anything you will ever see. Perhaps the most poignant device is the interview segment with the veterans in each episode  old men now but still alive with memories of their youth and of those "brothers" who never got to be old men. We aren't told who these men are until the end, and then we have to reconcile the real man with the character we just saw. Did he really do that? Did he really see that? Did he really live that? It is great that they have been able and willing to share this most remarkable chapter in their lives in a vehicle worthy of its task. Acting, production values, effects  all of it brilliantly done. I have never been interested in war/military movies. My husband forced me to watch the first episode of Band of Brothers by begging me and saying he knew I would like THIS one. Finally I gave in and couldn't stop watching. The next DVD went in and then the next and next... I have tried to watch others such as Saving Private Ryan (which I was told was great but still have never finished) and never made it through them. Band of Brothers keeps you interested and gets you feeling involved with their lives and feelings. I felt myself having emotions towards what was going on to the point of getting angry at characters as well as pride in others and having the overwhelming desire to meet these men (the real "Band of Brothers")This is the most incredible, realistic,emotional, desirable film I have ever seen and I am a big movie fanatic. I Love Band of Brothers and would recommend it to anyone given they are old enough for the content. I don't give many high scores to movies. I'm watching it for the second time, and I feel like I've been on D-Day myself. The action sequences are terrific. We have a very good sound system so the explosions, tanks, bullets are very realistic. Damian Lewis is so good as Lt. Winters, and the interviews with veterans adds to the emotional attraction of the movie. The contrast between characters is very believable, making the band of brothers a bunch of guys I could have been in the army with, and making deaths more poignant. Even the fake scenery doesn't seem so fake because the story is so good.I got angry at Blyhe and Gonohrrea (?), cheered with them when the US tanks showed up, and feared for them when attacking Carantan. I was initially put off by the fact David Schwimmer is in this but don't let it put you off.The cast is fantastic.The acting superb.It is a frighteningly realistic moving account of what it must have been like to take part.It starts off with the training+D-Day.The scenes at Bastogne and the Ardennes with them pinned down under fire whilst surviving the cold and conditions are both harrowing and inspiring.The episode where they find the concentration camp (episode 9)are truly heartbreaking.It shows what those brave men and others like them had to do and how through the men themselves are still dealing with.I cant praise Band of Brothers enough.Surely the best drama series ever made.10/10 This was without question the greatest series ever done about WWII. One becomes so engrossed with the characters that you feel pain when one of them is wounded/killed. It is a great tribute to the men of easy company and is one of Spielberg's greatest works. The characters are amazingly personable and very realistic. I actually became so into it that I watched the first 8 episodes all in a row, slept for a few hours and then watched the last two and a good deal of the special features. Its a rare blend of historical accuracy and great story-telling. The action scenes are very intense and once again echo the feeling that the person watching it was actually there among the men of Easy Company. In conclusion, it is an amazing series, and anyone who even slightly enjoys movies will absolutely love it. Brothers in arms is the best war movie i have ever seen, and i have seen tons of war movies. i think Steven Spileberg and Tom Hanks captured Easy company and World war 2 exactly as it was from Normandy to Easy company when they were disactivated as a fighting unit. also i think that every actor form Damian Lewis ( Richard D. Winters) write down to every extra who helped make the movie was captured exactly how they should be. They had the exact same equipment as the 1944 paratroopers had, right down to their trench knife. the way they captured the battles at Breccourt Manor and Bastogne was fantastic, i admire every man in Easy company who gave their life for his country. i have read the book by Steohen E. Ambrose and think the movie is almost exactly the same as he has written it.<br/><br/>In summing up i think anyone who is into the high action, high intensity of World War 2 this is the movie for u. I was wondering what this was about when I first heard of it, but when I actually saw it, I was astonished at how good it was. I was begging my dad to get me this for birthday or Christmas. I was so sad when it ended though, this is the BEST series ever!! My favorite episode is Bastogne and the one that followed it, best ones ever. If this was to be remade into a movie, I think it would be awesome! I would love to meet Guarner in real life, he seems so awesome in the series. My friend says this isn't entertaining, and I'm like, well this is war, it's not supposed to be entertaining. This series is explaining what happened in Normandy by accounts of REAL veterans. We have very few left, so we need as much knowledge as possible from them before they leave this world! This is one of Spielbergs greatest ever productions in my eyes and the fact that Tom Hanks also produced it is just an added bonus!! The mini series enlightens you to the horrific reality of world war two, it shows you the band between soldiers, friends and even compassion to the enemy. each episode takes you through one mission of E company and also other companies too focusing on building the characters. Spielberg did a great job picking the actors for this mini series as they all work truly great on screen together. the realistic battle scenes are breath taking, showing you the pressure of been in combat,especially when you don't want to be! through out the story characters die and new ones appear showing you the amazing stress of losing friends and having to replace them with fresh face's, then trying not to emotionally get attached to them knowing they wont last long. the mini series is so truly amazing that by the time its over you feel you have lost a great friend!! its a must see for all action fans for all war fans and most of all for anyone who enjoys the build up of characters!!. I have never, ever seen a more beautifully made mini-series. Heck, anything that has ever been filmed. The most amazing, talented and convincing war movie ever created. On D-Day, one feels that they are there among the other soldiers, waiting to jump out of the plane. Feeling the sickening dread and fear of death.<br/><br/>I was moved to tears many times throughout the entire mini-series, there are not enough words to describe this movie...<br/><br/>Beautiful, amazing, wondorous, masterpiece, tearful, moving, heartfelt, endearing, momentous, heart warming, dramatic, breath taking...<br/><br/>You must watch this mini-series, any chance you can possibly get, please watch this. A beautiful show of honor and the bond of brotherhood... There's not much else to add to the commentary already on this board other than to note the irony of an extremely well-crafted story that subtly reminds us of the horrors of warfare, the injustices and inhumanity of it, while still luring us with the nobility of its heroes, and the rightness of its cause. It reminds me of the old saws about war being what mankind does best. We are an aggressive, bellicose race, and have always honored our warrior castes and elites, in peace as much as in war. We celebrate its dread universality by turning it into entertainment--oh, with an educational bent to it, to be sure!--and seek to purge ourselves of our culpability in its evil by experiencing its destructiveness in surrogate. We come to know these men of Easy Company on their dangerous journey, and we identify with their losses and their triumphs, their fears and their bravery, their strengths and weaknesses. In our acceptance of them, we accept their circumstance. We put a human face on the Monster. We accept the inevitability of war.<br/><br/>Something to think about anyway. Beyond that, this is one kick-ass mini-series, with top-rank writing, directing, acting, cinematography, editing, sound, score, special effects, the works. Absolutely deserving of every accolade it has received, including its high ranking here on the IMDb. Thanks to those of you who have mentioned the DVD extras, I can't wait to see all of those. As a history buff, the interviews are one of my favorite parts. It's heartening to see so many folks impressed by this work even though there's no bogus love story interjected. <br/><br/>Add another, "my wife doesn't usually like war movies but she loved this one." We watched it hour after hour together, riveted, and watched several episodes a second time. A fantastic piece of work.<br/><br/>For fans of the movie, read more by Stephen Ambrose. It's very straight forward prose, nothing fancy, just tells the great stories he's researched. I'm looking forward to seeing the D-Day museum in New Orleans someday. I have just finished watching this for the third time. Due to the large number of speaking parts in this mini-series, one run through is not going to enable the audience to get to know the characters - and there are a plethora of rich and diverse personalities.<br/><br/>As a Brit who has recently emigrated, I was surprised at the relatively low exposure to this miniseries in the US, compared to the UK. B of B made network television in the UK (BBC) very soon after its release. Many without HBO in the US missed it completely - to be honest, I'm not sure the series would work well interspersed with commercials.<br/><br/>Words fail to convey the impact of this series. The portrayal of young men at the end of their tether is as moving as it is graphic. There are many memorable moments, but the German colonel's address to his troops, towards the end of the series says it all.<br/><br/>It was right that Major Winters has the last word - he did serve with a company of heroes! I support this show due to the fact that the actors are able to portray the scene at that time very well. They managed to get the message across in the very first episode, something very few shows are able to do that. The show is also easy to understand and requires no background knowledge on the subject to understand what is going on in the show. They have also made it in such a way that audiences can relate to their feelings and emotions very well. The effects are good and very accurate. Also everything there is based on facts and none of them is fictitious which is what makes it so appealing. The show is able to bring out the facts so accurately but in the process of telling you, it never bores you. Spielberg as co-producer of this film, assisted by Tom Hanks, obviously "cut his teeth" on this war genre by his experience of making "Saving of Private Ryan".He has set the standard to which other producers must now aspire if they are thinking of producing another WWII film.Indeed as a connoisseur of war films over the years, it is interesting how realism has gradually come to the fore.In the 1950s dieing actor/soldiers merely put up a hand to their anatomy to where the bullet hit and dutifully fell to earth.I believe critics pointed out in "Soldier Blue" from the 1960s the scene in the tepee where someone had a bullet pass through their head bringing with it brains. This was quite a brave & revolutionary film device at the time.We move onto the 1970s and "A Bridge too Far", again the wounded appear more bloodied but with hindsight it still seems too clinical compared to what we must suspect is the reality of war."Saving Private Ryan" showed us legs & arms being torn off by mortar bombs, bullets zipping through the Omaha water with a bloody wake and a more realistic portrayal of the damage done by bullets.<br/><br/>Some readers may think it strange that I can enjoy "Band of Brothers" just as much but in a different way to the highly acclaimed 1995 BBC TV mini series of "Pride & Prejudice".My DVD sound-around system has never been put to better use than when viewing these modern dvds using the latest media techniques designed for heightened viewing enjoyment.One of the 8 speakers in my TV room I have positioned next to my right ear and to hear from this a sound track of just a ricocheting bullet or a tank traversing its gun and reloading is most stimulating and engrossing.Also one can hear individual sound tracks normally lost in normal mono or even stereo systems.<br/><br/>This mini series shows the initial training in the USA of a group of volunteers who wish to become paratroopers and are to formed into "Easy Company" as part of the elite 101st Airborne Division.To be accepted is very difficult and many volunteers are "RTUd"(returned to unit)as we say in the Britain.What follows is their participation in the airborne assault part of D-Day followed by the vicious in-fighting of Normandy leading up to the "Battle of the Bulge" when the German army panzers attempted to counter-attack by breaking out of the Ardennes forest in Belgium and the heroic stand made by Easy Company and others at the town of Bastoigne when the US commander famously replied "Nuts" to a German request for their surrender.Later we see the men in action during the ill fated "Operation Market Garden" battle for Arnhem in September 1944 then the breakthrough across the Rhine and into Germany finally culminating in their occupation of the "wolf's lair" at Bertschesgarten in Bavaria as part of the victorious allied occupation at the war's end.<br/><br/>What is unique in each episode are the interviews with surviving U.S. veterans who actually participated in the ensuing action.The mini-series comes on 6 discs, 5 of which have a two sided feature to see the drama enactment of the above career of "Easy Company".The 6th disc is devoted to interviews with the veterans and carefully chosen film from WWII to illustrate their monologues.It was definitely the right decision to appoint relatively unknown actors to play the principal roles as you don't want Hollywood stars getting in the way of this docu-drama introduced by veteran paratroopers.<br/><br/>I watched this memorable production over three nights and returned the box and its contents at its conclusion back on the shelf next to Jane Austen. I had seen various episodes of this series when it first ran on HBO. I really enjoyed it then and wanted to watch it over and over. I later saw some of them on the History channel. Finally My wife bought the entire DVD series and I have been hooked. I can't get over the detail to which the series continues to adhere. If you have not seen this series rent it or borrow it. I have enjoyed it and recommend it to my friends who have not been disappointed. Further, I enjoy following the characters that are depicted in the series. All of the actors, including Donnie Whalberg were excellent. If you have seen any of the actors who play in the series in other roles, you easily forget that and are drawn into the characters they play in Band of Brothers. Lastly I found the efforts to maintain historical accuracy were excellent. The depiction of Psychological injuries suffered is often omitted from the vast number of WWII movies. This is s disservice to the men who fought, and there is no sugar coating here. The Band of Brothers shows were very well done... Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg did an excellent job of making all parts of it historically accurate. "Band of Brothers" and "Saving Private Ryan" are the only war movies that I have ever watched with my Dad that he says accurately portray what combat in WWII was really like.. Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg selected a very talented group of actors for "Band of Brothers"... they all did an excellent job on their parts. I especially liked Damian Lewis, Ron Livingston, Matthew Settle, Donnie Wahlberg, Shane Taylor and Michael Cudlitz. I have very much enjoyed watching the 10 parts of Band of Brothers and discussing it with my Dad who was also in WWII.<br/><br/>I very much enjoyed Ron Livingston's little movie documenting the actors boot camp... It was great! My husband is heavily into WWII. He participates in "living history" reenactments and has stacks of books and movies on the subject. After queasing my way through "Saving Private Ryan" and other similar films, I was less than ecstatic when he told me he really wanted me to watch "Band of Brothers" with him when it aired on the History Channel. I like history; I'm a nerd who loves trivia and how historical events fit together. I am NOT a "war-buff" nor am I "WWII-crazy". I was prepared to grin and bear it; enjoy the interesting historical tidbits that crop up in typical war dramas for his sake, grit my eyes through the super-grisly bits and thank the Lord when it was over. I was blown away. Here was a drama for anyone curious (or intensely interested) in WWII. This gave accurate presentations of uniforms, conditions, battles and experiences that would satisfy the hard-core buff while presenting the very human story of young men being forced to grow up fast and hard by a brutal situation. The sets, locations, props, special effects and filming were without fault. The acting was brilliant. <br/><br/>Though certainly not something I would pop right in for a child, this was a sensitive, yet unflinching portrayal of a company's experience from training to going back home. It was powerful and moving; sometimes funny, sometimes painfully sad--but excellent throughout. I would recommend this as an instant classic for all time. When asked about my thoughts on this movie, I am usually at a loss for words. It is such a powerful drama and delves into the lives of Easy Company and how they and many others fought in WWII. As I watched I became a part of this epic story- I found myself in mourning for those who had lost their lives. I found myself laughing with those who had the rare "happy" experiences in the worst of times. I found myself fearing what was going to happen next. I truly felt like they were my family, my band of brothers. It has been over 6 months since I've seen the full miniseries and I still shake my head and have trouble explaining how the movie invaded my mind, my dreams, and how I perceive life. After watching the miniseries I remember feeling like it was *I* who was there experiencing the events as they unfolded. I felt like those portrayed in the movie really were my close friends during the good times and the bad times. Thinking about it now, I feel sad knowing that I will never get to see some of my good friends again. I just got finished watching the series last night and you'd think that after watching a 10+ hour miniseries, you'd be burnt out on it. Definitely not the case with Band of Brothers. It's so well made that I may go home and start from the beginning again. <br/><br/>The characters in this series are so well developed that you find yourself mourning their loss and feeling the pain they experience when a comrade of theirs is killed or wounded. <br/><br/>You don't have to be a WWII buff to enjoy this movie. It helps but even those that don't care much for war movies may find the story about the men themselves to be moving enough to enjoy the series.<br/><br/>An easy 10/10. I can't recommend it enough. This mini-series follows the members of Easy Company, 101st Airborne Division, from training through the end of WW II in Europe. The episodes are based on actual events and the characters portrayed are "real" people. The story is not new but the acting, direction, special effects, sets, props, costumes are wonderful. In many ways the viewer gets the impression of being in the middle of what is happening, especially in the combat sequences. The airborne troopers are heroically brave, sometimes almost foolishly so. They stick together, they don't retreat (very often) and more to the point they don't ever give up. When faced with impossible tasks and impossible odds, they keep going and achieve the impossible. But the paratroopers are not the one-dimensional characters of most "war movies". They are very real young men full of hopes and fears, eccentricities, virtues and vices, anger and resentment as well as joy and fellowship. They are frequently sent to fight in extremely difficult situations (like dropping into Normandy at night or having to defend Bastogne during the Battle of the Bulge). They stand up to the challenge for the most part - some get killed and some get wounded and some go on unscathed. As the war in Europe goes on in late 1944 and into 1945 they become less idealistic, more hardened. Late in the war they liberate a concentration camp and are horrified and disgusted by what they find. The end of the war finds them at Hitler's retreat in Bavaria - where the survivors clean out Herman Goering's winecellar and celebrate for weeks - even with the war over some of them get killed - by drunken drivers and crazy drunken G.I.s shooting without cause. At then end of the series the surviving members of Easy Company appear and talk about their experiences. The story is marvelous, the acting superb - all of it is exceptionaly good. These are the young men who saved the world in WW II - they were and are the real deal. There has never been a movie, TV show or mini-series which portrayed real American soldiers in WW II or any other war with such detail, accuracy, drama and poignancy. It doesn't get any better than this. A lot of movies have been made that have been great, but, this one takes you through the lives of real hero's. No Die Hard, or Lethal Weapon made up characters, but, rather, real life hero's. The hardest thing to realize is that these men/boys, did what these actors had to do, without any chances to yell "cut" or that's a wrap. These were simply kids brought in to fight in the worst conditions in could imagine. If anyone has not seen this group of movies all the way through, they are truly missing out. If you are visiting this site to try and make your decision about whether or not you should watch it, stop reading, and just push play. Seeing so many of the worlds troops currently deployed all over the world, one can again realize how awful war is. And, in the same breath, we must thank and honor those that put their lives on the line, to keep us all safe! Thank your to Hanks/Spielberg for giving the REAL hero's the attention they deserve. Leave it to HBO to produce one of the best mini-series ever created.<br/><br/>Band of Brothers tells the story of 101st Airborne's actions in World War II. From basic training to the fall of Hitler's Eagle's Nest, it is a running scorecard of this famed unit's actions.<br/><br/>As a film, it is perhaps the best war movie ever filmed, especially one filmed on real events (unlike Private Ryan, which is also an excellent film, Band of Brothers is not fiction).<br/><br/>This mini-series is very well written with fascinating characters and great acting. You actually believe these *are* the soldiers we're following around, not simply actors portraying characters on a screen. That is the truest testament to the fine acting in this series, it's seamless!<br/><br/>Couple that with great photography, effects and stunts, and you have a great set of DVDs.<br/><br/>But perhaps my favorite bit of Band of Brothers is what it *doesn't* include. Unlike other WWII dreck like "Pearl Harbor", "The Battle of the Bulge" (with Henry Fonda), "Midway", or countless other "real war" films, the producers, writers and director of Band of Brothers felt no need to create faux "human interest" stories about lost loves or hidden gold or other silliness.<br/><br/>This series gives you the war and the people who were in it. And that's it. And that is what makes it so good. 10 out of 10.<br/><br/>
Barky When I first heard of Band of Brothers a week ago I thought that this was just a Saving Private Ryan ripoff but I would now reconsider on that. This show is hands down one of the most dramatic and compelling shows on the planet. Throughout the show You'll feel great emotion for Easy Company and all the men that died for our country that fought against the Nazis. I highly suggest reading the book the watching the show since it adds more emotion in my opinion. And what i think made this show great was both the acting and its not some crappy Rambo esquire shoot em up action. The only weakness is the DVD set sells for about two hundred dollars but its worth the price. If you have not seen this show make sure you do NOW!!!<br/><br/>Overall 10/10 no surprise in my scoring. My summary pretty much says it all about this series. I applaud both Tom Hanks and the entire cast and crew for such an outstanding work. If you have ever seen 'Saving Private Ryan', this is essentially the same except with a much richer storyline, far deeper character development and a heck of a lot longer (I.e. 10 1-hour episodes).<br/><br/>I think the two best things about this series are the war scenes and the character development. <br/><br/>The war scenes rival, if not surpass, those in Saving Private Ryan (the other WWII epic by Tom Hanks/Stephen Spielberg). They all seem to use the 'shakey cam' technique to show how fast and brutal combat can be. And the sound is unbelievable. If you have a surround sound system you will be dodging bullets left and right, covering your ears from the massive explosions and ducking your head when planes or artillery rounds buzz overhead.<br/><br/>The character development, on the other hand, is very well done. You basically follow the characters from boot camp all the way until the capture of Berlin. You really get to know and care about each and every man. You'll even find yourself in tears when someone whom you've really begun to find yourself attached to gets killed. That, to me, makes an excellent story because it really gets you into it...you want to know what happens next and who will continue to make it!<br/><br/>Anyways, as I said before, if you like WWII movies (particularily Saving Private Ryan) then this series will not only impress you, but make you run out and by the DVD boxed set right away! (Which, by the way, is absolutely beautiful!) When I first saw this movie i thought it would be a boring movie, like the usual ones we watch in SS. but this one was different. Band of Brothers makes you feel like your out there with those boys. Each chapter brings more suspense and heartache. Band of Brothers make you feel the pain they went through every time someone gets hit. It is amazing how close to the real thing this movie is. The fact that they actually have the guys who were really there talk about it is awesome. It is also amazing how these guys all from different backgrounds were able to forget their differences and work together. Like the motto says "The world depended on them, they depended on each other". Best Movie Ever!!!!!!!!!! 50 million stars!!! :) :) BoB is a GREAT series. Expertly filmed and directed. Do Not think of the actors as actors, or you'll miss a lot!! Whether it was a conscious decision or not, the fact that the actors aren't well known, helps the viewer to think of them as soldiers and Not actors. But............<br/><br/>If you've never been in combat, or for that matter, never served in the military you can't really understand or appreciate this series....<br/><br/>To bad we don't have "smell-a-vision' to capture the odors of war: cordite, burning flesh, petrol, and wood; stench of blood and death... Perhaps the reason why this movie is beyond effective is because of it's cast.  They were surprisingly believable mostly because these are men we are not used to seeing on-screen.  Before BOB, many were casts as no-names or known to niche audiences.  Beyond the actors, the aspects of realism were multi-faceted....from the writing and cinematography all the way up to the clips of the real Easy Company (provided in the DVD series).  The film has done its part it its ability to make one sympathetic and empathetic to all those who have courageously fought in battle for reasons beyond themselves. I applaud the creators and participants  of Band of Brothers for fully stretching the capacity of film making.  For the privilege to see this artful account of history and the ability to be profoundly affected, I recommend Band of Brothers wholeheartedly. The HBO mini series BAND OF BROTHERS about easy company of the 506 regiment of the 101 airborne is a very good series.  It shows how the men face the harsh war and survive. The episodes are fabulous  i think the directors did a good job of recreating the war.<br/><br/>Also it focuses on the lives of different people like Luitenit,Captin,Major.Richard Winters,Sergent.Bill Guarnere,1Sergent.Carwood Limpton. The experiances that they went through must have been horrible. I would just like to thank Stephen Spielburg and Tom Hanks for making it.If you watch the series you should read the book it's even better. Aside from the fact that this movie was made for installment Mini series television, there is little that separates this film from a major motion picture release type quality.  The cast that portrays the Band of Brothers of Easy Company are easily believable and likeable.  Damian Lewis an Englishman does a really nice job playing the lead role in this film.  With real life interviews with the men who were being portrayed on the film preceding each episode, it is really nice to have an air of authenticity to the action on the screen.  Filmed in the same gray scale toned film as Saving Private Ryan the colors are washed out and lend an air of realism to what you are watching.  Changes in directorial style from one episode to another are not noticeable and the musical score throughout the series is nothing short of magnificent.  This is a must for World War II and other military buff to add to their collection of favorite movies.  I purchased the DVD set before actually viewing anything more than the trailer and I was hooked.  I have watched the series at least three or four times since I bought it and think it is one of the best mini-series ever made.  Using state of the art pyrotechnics and realistic sets and on-site locations, you are left with the feel and the sights and sounds of the Western parts of Europe, from France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany, at all times, the realism and dedication to detail is truly noteworthy.  The action in this film is nowhere as gritty or intense as the opening or closing scenes in Saving Private Ryan, nor as gory either, but there are several characters who are injured or killed through the course of the film who die what one could only imagine suffer painful, and horrific wounds, and while the graphic content of this film is not nearly as graphic as Saving Private Ryan, some viewers may wish to turn their heads at several points in the film.  Overall, I would commend this film as one of the best mini-series ever made if not in the top 5 than surely in the top ten.  The adaption from the late Stephen Ambroses book of the same name is very well done and follows his writings bery well.  The dialogue is believable and well acted and well scripted. I went into this series thinking it would be kind of 'supplementary' to Saving Private Ryan, something not quite as good as that movie was but at least a pretty good war show, anyway. I was wrong. It's at least the equal of Ryan, if not beyond. Everything, from the acting to the cinematography to the story are absolutely spectacular. The work between Damian Lewis and Ron Livingston alone make the series great. The rest just build from their base and make a tremendous sum of the parts. That's good acting, that's good writing and that's good directing, And I challenge anyone to find a more emotional episode of television than 'Why We Fight'. It's almost beyond Schindler's List or The Pianist for it's gut wrenching impact, almost worse than the actual footage of the camps themselves. Anyway, if you're reading this site wondering whether or not Band of Brothers is worth the look, believe me, it is. And a whole lot more. Bravo!! Encore!!  Quite simply the best war movie made to date.  Although Â‘Saving Private Ryan' raised the bar exponentially when it was released, BOB will be the standard against which all war movies will be measured for quite some time.  Many of the same techniques were used in both movies.<br/><br/>My father had recorded every episode when it originally came on HBO and loaned me the tapes after the series was completed.  I then watched the whole thing (all 10 hours of it) nonstop till the end.  Sleep be damned! Hunger be damned!  I couldn't take my eyes away and only paused (begrudgingly) for the obligatory bathroom breaks.  <br/><br/>What I liked best was that everything was as true to fact as they could get it.  There were a few embellishments and fictitious characters (most of which were created to represent several real people), but in all there were no Johnny Rambo types and no attempts to emotionally manipulate the viewer. The movie seemed to say, `Here it is, in all its naked glory.  Deal with it!'<br/><br/>A must for armchair historians and pureist nutcakes.  The DVD set is a little pricey, but you get what you pay for. This is one of the best mini series ever on the small screen. It has the added advantage of being a very good production with 5.1 sound which is very unusual for a television series at the moment. The story follows the exploits of Easy Company through ww2. Even Better than Saving Private Ryan the performance of Damian Lewis is excellent throughout. I've always been interested on WW2, and loved Saving Private Ryan. Since this is by the star and director of SPR, I was really looking forward to this. The British papers slagged BOB off way before it was aired because of the fact that it's a strictly Amercian affair, and according to the papers, BOB (and SPR)  show the war being won by just the Amercians. I found the accusation rather unfair. The fact is that both stories soley focused on one group of Americans,(BOB is based on a book) and told the American solders story. Yeah, they could have focused on the Brits, but then they could have focused on the Australians, French etc etc, and all the other countries that participated in the  war. And so any country not shown could have screamed 'unfair!!!' Of course there are a lot of Brit actors in it. I especially like Damian Lewis as the lovely compassionate and loyal Richard Winters....<br/><br/> Anyhow, BOB is a fantastic, mesmerising piece of TV drama. Just watching the horrific battle scenes make me wonder how on earth these brave men came out of the war sane. It also made me think how grateful we should all be to the brave soilders who gave their lives for freedom....BOB should be shown to the teenagers in history lessons. They'll learn a lot. There are no big stars -- it's a mostly English cast with a few Americans in some key roles -- and it doesn't break any new t.v. ground like, for example, All in the Family, or MASH, or Hill Street Blues or even the Sopranos.  Alot of what happens is fairly predictable -- after all, it's war, and we know who wins (those of us outside the U.S., anyway -- nudge nudge, wink wink).  It is, however, one of the finest productions ever made for television, if not *the* finest.<br/><br/>Anybody who considers Saving Private Ryan to be a great movie really needs to see Band of Brothers.  It's what Private Ryan wished it could be. Hollywood war films are problematic from the get go because those who make them (however good their intentions) succumb to the temptations to sensationalize violence and preach about something they've never experienced.  "Band of Brothers" is the rare exception.  It recreates the life of American combat soldiers during WW2. For many topics which are perennial in the literature of war it stands alone (small example, the ambivalent feelings of veterans to new recruits).  People who prefer John Wayne films or even more "artsy" war films ("Apocalypse Now", "Thin Red Line"), I think, just don't get just how easily such films devolve into a kind of sanctimonious war pornography.  HBO did well. I watched this series while it was on television and I have to say I was completely absorbed. This miniseries is powerful, realistic, and dram at its historic best. While it is, in essence, a far cry from Saving Private Ryan, the spirit is the same. The brotherhood that develops between men in service. I honestly think Tom Hanks and Speilberg are going to go places. Both are amazing in their cinematic creations: Speilberg for such masterpieces as ET and SPR, and Hanks for his honest, brutally realistic portrayal of Forrest Gump. These two will go places. Band Of Brothers has every aspect you expect in a war reenactment: Drama, fear, the bitter French winters, frightening realism, and the dedication and loyalty of the soldiers. Truly a work for those who appreciate the price these men paid, and not just watching for war-based violence and gore. The series is good as they come,in fact the series is as elite in war movies as easy company was in the AEF.<br/><br/>The reason it's so good is the interviews with veterans at the start or end which gives it added realism and the fact that it follows the men from their training at Camp Toccoa to end of the war in Europe.<br/><br/>This gives it an edge over other war movies which focus on a single campaign,battle or operation,i.e Saving Private Ryan,We Were Soldiers and A Bridge Too Far because you ask yourself "What happens to them later in the war?", "Where are they from?" etc etc etc.Band of Brothers answers these questions.<br/><br/>The pyrotechnics,special effects,cinematography and the fact that its very accurate to what happened,combined together makes a masterpiece and will rightly put it in the annals of television and film  greats.<br/><br/>10/10 The story of Easy Company, a paratrooper airborne division, and all they went through in WWII starting with training and continuing until the end of the war.  This 10 hour mini-series is absolutely stunning.  Amazing cast, amazing special effects, amazing story, great soundtrack, very in-depth with the real men of Easy Company talking about what happened at the beginning of each part and the story shown as realistic as possible.  The camerawork is also great, although in some of the war scenes it gets a bit shaky.  All and all an absolute must see.  **** out of **** If you liked this series, which I guess just about everyone does, do yourself a favor and read the book by Ambrose afterwards. Like Black Hawk Down, the film only represents a fraction of all the events that happened. The book will add a lot more depth and enjoyment to your BOB experience. I recommend you read the book AFTER seeing the film. Otherwise you'll be like me saying to yourself, "I can't believe they left so much out!" It's a little bit distracting and disappointing. If anything, thumb through it next time you see it at the bookstore - you gotta see what Captain Sobel really looked like! A very well done series that is unique in many ways.  Like having the company as opposed to individual people be the main character.  And the changing directors made each part somewhat different in feel and style.<br/><br/>But I do think it's a overrated here on IMDB.  I felt there were flaws in character development (mostly due to lack thereof, which admittedly is tough given that the series centers on the experiences of the unit itself), cinematography (most of the battle scenes simply feel claustrophobic.  I realize that the fighting got in close at times, but not that close *all* of the time.)  Also, the acting felt a little *off* at points, again usually in the battle scenes.  The urgency in the way a man moves while being shot wasn't always captured.  You know that keep your head *DOWN* and become one with the dirt mentality that soldiers seem to have.  The glitches happened just enough to yank me out of my suspended disbelief.  And like most war movies the tragic irony mechanic was used a bit too often. <br/><br/>
Overrated here or not, it's a very good series and well worth watching. Recommended!<br/><br/>And "A Bridge Too Far" is far from "upbeat" and 'cowboy'-esque.  If you like Band of Brothers and Saving Private Ryan, ABtF should be part of your library also. Band of Brothers tells the story of the 506th 101st airborne infantry, Easy Company. It follows them from Normandy on D-Day until the final stop at Hitler's Eagles Nest. With Band of Brothers, you don't see action with a Hollywood love story backing it, you see men fighting for their lives. This TV Mini-Series portrays the war not as a love triangle or rescue mission with a slight dash of 'Fighting' on the side. Band of Brothers just tells a story of Easy Company, and their fight to survive World War II together.<br/><br/>Any Recommendation I can offer would never be high enough, because Band of Brothers should be in every Collection. When I first heard about this mini-series when it was being advertised on HBO, I knew it would be fantastic.  Since I don't have digital cable, I avoided watching it when it was presented in HDTV and 5.1 sound via HBO.  I waited for DVD...and it was well worth the wait.  The story of EASY company is amazing and by the end of the series, I felt as though I knew each of the men involved.  The series does a fantastic job incorporating the characters amidst all the chaos.  I will cherish this DVD collection and will watch it over and over... 5 out of 5 stars! I first picked up the tape 3 & 4 from the public library. Since those are `education' not `entertainment' I was expecting a `war diary' sort of documentary. Something got hold of me and I came back again and again, looking for others in the series. My thirst was not slaked until I finally bought the whole DVD set.<br/><br/>In a sense this is a war diary, for the lack of climax buildup and big ending in each episode, and the characters are all very much human-sized. However it says much about the making of Brothers that every scene, in shattering explosions or in silence, is equally spectacular and memorable:<br/><br/>
Private Blithe slowly rolls his eyes and tries to rise - the defining moment of the opening stage.<br/><br/>the snow in episode 6 has such an unworldly quality. The scene where two soldiers were blown up to bits while crying out to a third to jump in, is almost cruelly funny. The friendship between Eugene and the Belgian nurse is done just right. When the building crumpled it's like a light was no more.<br/><br/>
Overall technically I have very little to pick. The strength of the film lies not just in great actions etc but also in the numerous everyday conversations. Soldier's grouches are superb throughout. what more appropriate name than the `easy company'! Only complaint is I started in the middle and Ross' (from Friends) sudden appearance was quite startling, but hardly his fault.<br/><br/>From times immemorial men with heavy boots and helmets have sacrificed their lives and won battles on hostile lands. So how could the story be told differently, say, with a German SS company? Maybe Brothers is so good a little cynicism is justified on the part of its foundations. In episode 9, the pace slackened amidst the beautiful Austrian countryside, and men in the easy company were now grabbing the `points' to go home. Those handsome boys have a job, a farm, and a life to return to so perhaps this is the beginning and end of their mission. They are good soldiers all right, but reluctant at heart. This unassuming episode I think has spoken the whole point eloquently and it touches me indeed.<br/><br/>`A bridge too far' is another classic that tells almost the same story, but it belongs to the upbeat, `cowboy' category. There is no need to go in to detail of why this is probably the best cinematic or televised event of all time...simply watch it & see for yourself.  It will leave you not only speechless, but breathless as well...enjoy. "Band of Brothers" like "Black Hawk Down" and "We Were Soldiers" proves that when Hollywood just for a moment suspends its instinctive PC bigotry it can produce a first class war story. "Saving Private Ryan", a work of fiction, had all the fighting and none of the reason; if you entered the theater ignorant of why we were in Normandy, you left just as ignorant. "Schindler's List" had all the reason and none of the fighting; if you entered the theater ignorant of all the violence it took to end the Nazi violence, you left just as ignorant.<br/><br/>But "Band of Brothers" very faithfully follows Stephen Ambrose's book of the same name. Ambrose was careful to narrow his research to a single company in the 101st Airborne, and follow them from training in America to the Eagle's Nest in the Obersalzberg. You see the fighting, and in Episode IX you see the reason, aptly titled "Why We Fight". You live with the men, eat with the men and die with the men, as much as a piece of celluloid (or videotape) can portray it.<br/><br/>Some people will argue that a piece of celluloid is always a work of fiction. Sam Fuller, film director (Big Red One) and WW2 combat infantryman, once said that the only honest way to give an audience the feel of combat was to raise the curtain and have a machine gun hose them down. Fuller was right and he should know, better than the vast majority of us who have lived our lives only in peace.<br/><br/>But the real test of any movie (or miniseries) is the level to which it accomplishes suspension of disbelief, and transports the viewer to the context of the story it is telling. And "Band of Brothers" succeeds at that perfectly. There is absolutely nothing you can fault about Band of Brothers. It is totally different from any other film or television series about World War II. Joseph E Levine hailed his A Bridge Too Far as the definitive film of World War II and while it was quite good for its time it was nothing like as good as Band of Brothers. Incidentally, Colonel Robert F Sink was portrayed in that film by Elliott Gould although his name was changed to Stout. That is the other thing that makes Band of Brothers more effective, there is very little if any fictionalisation in it. The war is shown exactly as it was. Military vehicle buffs may have noticed that the Germans are in authentic German vehicles. There are no Patton and Bulldog tanks or M3 half tracks done up in pseudo German colours like in the war films of the 60s and 70s. New technology must make producing replicas cheaper or a large number in museums have now been restored to running condition. The computer generated effects are also incredible. The acting all round is very good and it's strange to see David Schwimmer as the tyrannical Lieutenant Sobel. So many people cannot imagine him as anyone other than Ross and it's not hard to imagine a Friends episode titled "The One Where Ross Goes On An Assertiveness Training Course". Shows that he's quite a versatile actor. The interviews with the veterans at the beginning of each episode were something different and gave a bit of added interest. Band of Brothers really shows up the poor quality of previous films and drama series about World War II which tended to glamourise it and, in the case of British drama series of the 70s and 80s, show it in a cosy and nostalgic light with contrived romances between English women and American servicemen. The only criticism you can make is that it can sometimes  be difficult to distinguish the different characters but that's a small thing and doesn't detract from Band of Brothers being a very good anti-war drama. This mini film only came to us here in the UK a few months ago, I have to say the it was facinating!! i had to watch every episode of the film, (sadly it came in 10 seprate episodes)But i was unditerd by that if i had to go out on a friday night when it was on i would make sure i would record it on my VCR.<br/><br/>I became so hooked on the film that i bought the book, which i have therefore read and it was completely SPOT ON!!! the book just made the film come even more to life. Steven Ambrose and steven spileberg have done The men of Easy Company PROUD!!! I was very impressed and profoundly moved by the opening installment of "Band of Brothers."   The presentation of the conflict between Winters and Soebel was an interesting look at methods of command and leadership under stress.   The jump sequence was stunning, comparable to the opening of "Private Ryan," in its frightful intensity.   The battle to destroy the German battery had a gritty realism to it which I felt was even better than the last half hour of "Private Ryan," and I believe captured the essence of small unit actions.<br/><br/>I'm a military historian and teach a course on WWII.   I'm recommending this one to my students and friends, and hope that the series sustains the level of realism so far achieved.   Yet again, Spielberg & Hanks have demonstrated a commitment to showing the harsh reality of war, and honoring those who stood against tyranny. "Band of Brothers" transcends most of the ordinary limitations of cinema. By its careful direction, realistic sets, and slow-but-sure character development, it succeeds where so many other movies (even "Saving Private Ryan") have failed --- it actually takes you inside the mind of a soldier. If you never watch another movie about World War II, watch this show. This great series takes to the front line of world war 2 from Dday to the end of the war.Why is it great because it is well written and very well acted but lots of war films have been,this one stands out because of the clips of the veterans.It moves you to hear the survivors talk of the war and the horror yet they remember each other and would willingly sacrifice their own lives for each other.I will close with two memorable quotes from the veterans unfortunately I forget who they were but they are true indeed. There are very few heroes alive from world war2 there buried over there and this quote says it all Grandpa were you a hero in world war2 No but I served in a company of heroes. Nobody writes better books about WW2 than Stephen Ambrose. This mini-series was terrific but the book was better, in the book it really told how brave and a great leader Dick Winters was! It wasn't Private Ryan(nothing can) but pretty good, I hope it comes out on tape. I had read historian Stephen Ambrose's "D-DAY" and "Citizen Soldiers" before I read "Band of Brothers."  I thought both of the former works were excellent, and could understand why many claim that this author has made history popular among the general public again.  Steven Spielberg had originally planned to adapt "Citizen Soldiers" into a mini-series to represent the stories and experiences of American GI's in WWII, and this would have been an enormous, almost impossible task.  Tom Hanks convinced him to go with "Band of Brothers," since the work covered a Company of soldiers, not that of the entire United States Army in the ETO.  However, "BoB" wasn't such an easily adaptable book. <br/><br/>"Band of Brothers" turned out to be not much smaller in scope than Ambrose's other works.  Nor was it as narrowly focused.  Following an entire company of soldiers is not as intimate as the producers may have expected.  This resulted in a weakness that has drawn the most criticism--that (with some exceptions) it is hard for us to distinguish between the many characters whom we meet throughout the mini-series, and that none of them are examined closely enough for us to really know them.  The book was even broader, without giving us the luxury of having faces to attach the many names to. Being a fan of this material, I followed the characters tediously as they appeared on screen, using the book to remember who they were and what roles they played in the story.  I doubt any casual viewer did this, and that's why the series drew much criticism. <br/><br/>But the creators of "BoB" must definitely be commended for their mostly successful efforts to pick and choose the stories to put an emphasis on, and for going outside the source material when they needed to.   Ambrose surprisingly sped through and devoted little to many of E Company's most dramatic moments, like Captain Sobel's loss of command, the gloomy story of private Blythe, Denver Randleman's extremely tense fight with a German soldier in a barn, and the company's liberation of a concentration camp. Certain characters who have large roles in the mini-series (like Percante, Blythe, Medic Gene Roe, etc.) were mentioned only on one or two pages in the book. <br/><br/>The episodes are well selected stories from the book.  The first two that aired simultaneously were very well done, although viewing them gave me more of a sense of adventure, exhilaration and heroism than they did of sacrifice.  That theme comes off best in the episode "Breaking Point," which is probably the best installment of the series.  Most of the emphasis of the early episodes is on combat, later it focuses more on the characters.  I couldn't get enough of the realistic, jarring battle sequences, however they are becoming more commonplace in the wake of "Saving Private Ryan."  I wasn't too surprised that that film expressed the theme and efforts of the greatest generation superior to this series after viewing all of the episodes. <br/><br/>The production is of course very impressive.  Gunners on top of Sherman tanks, convincing German vehicles, hundreds of soldiers on screen at a time, and well constructed period sets give the series a feeling of great authenticity.  It is quite bloody, and gorier as the episodes progress. Casual observers may feel that they've got all that they need from watching a few episodes.  But for many of us that would not be enough.  I'm glad that it was completed, at such a grand scale.  I can't wait for the DVD. Grade: B+ Having now completed watching the excellent HBO series 'Band of Brothers' I feel that it was possibly one of the best efforts to come out of America.With its fine pedigree of real life heroes input,splendid Acting, Directing and large budget it really made the grade. Having also read the Stephen Ambrose book I could really relate to the different episodes.<br/><br/>One minor quibble,is that considering there was an English actor playing one of the main roles(a fine portrayal by Damien Lewis)how come the actors who played the few 'Brits' all sounded like they graduated from the Mary Poppins/Dick Van Dyke school of English.We didn't speak like that then and we don't speak like that now....<br/><br/> To reiterate a fine series telling the tale of just a small part of the great American War effort........Well done to all<br/><br/> Thank you all you real American Band of Brothers Not since the days of Rich Man-Poor Man,or North and South have I waited all week to see the next episode. This of course surpassed both of these previous marathons. I dreaded this series, having hated Private Ryan, but it surpassed any expectations. Day of Days and Why We Fight were astonishing. Indescribable. Build a bigger shelf Mr Speilburg. Every award next year is yours. I have watched with relish all 10 episodes of this fantastic mini-series as i thoroughly enjoyed Saving Private Ryan. The realism of the battle scenes fill me with horror, and go a small way to help me understand what the brave allied soldiers went through in WW2. My thanks go out to all who fought for us during this time, and also to everybody who made this wonderful viewing possible. I have sat fixated on the screen for the past 10 Sundays (plus the follow-up tonight) following these brave men who fought so valiently for us to have a better life today.  This should be required viewing for all History students around the country to attempt to show our future what our predecessors have done to help preserve our way of life.<br/><br/>These men were exceptional (as were all who served).  Moreover Kudos to the Actors in this series who truly seemed passionate about the roles they were playing.  Awe inspiring!! The battle scenes which showed Germans and Americans desperately fighting were great!  Surprisingly, and unfortunately, there weren't enough of them. Even the episode entitled "Bastogne" didn't actually show Germans and Americans fighting, but rather tree top explosions, wounded men in foxholes, and an inept company leader.  I guess that may have been Easy Company's perspective on the battle.  There are many great stories about the ferocious pitched defensive battles during the Battle of the Bulge, and I was disappointed.  Don't get me wrong, this was a great WW2 Mini-series.  I just think it would have been better if a WW2 mini-series included great battles in every episode, instead of just a few. Once again HBO has shown that they make most of the great programming on Television.  It is no small wonder that every year they get so many Emmy awards.  It is too bad that HBO isn't free to everyone.  ABC, CBS, & NBC should really pay attention to what excellence means. "Band of Brothers" is not just a miniseries, and it seems that many people here have forgotten that. It is based on true events, with only some slight dramatization (for example, episode 8, Private Webster's return to the company...it was not really that unwelcoming. Captain Spiers welcomed him back and said that the company needed more men like him back, and in fact, he didn't even go on the patrol.)  It is based largely on Stephen Ambrose's 1992 book entitled "Band of Brothers: E Company, 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne, From Normandy to Hitler's Eagle's Nest."  The characters are real, the events are real, the places are real.<br/><br/>I have seen many comments saying that the characters are hard to follow, hard to keep track of who is who. One person even said that they thought Richard Winters was purposely made to seem anonymous, because a "fresh 17-year recruit" would probably view him in the same light. What that person has forgotten is that by Episode 5: The Crossroads, except for the replacements, most of the men had been with Winters for two years, since Toccoa.  Episode 5 starts in October 1944. Easy Company was formed in the summer of 1942. I don't think that there was a single man who only recognized Winters's face and not his name.<br/><br/>I have no problems reocnizing names. Of course, I am in the middle of reading the book, but I started the book after Episode 7 aired, and I knew all of the characters' names by then. Winters, Nixon, Guarnere, Toye, Malarkey, Liebgott, Ramirez, Muck, Penkala, Luz, Perconte, Lipton, Roe, Webster, Hoobler, Heffron, Martin, Randleman, Welsh, Spiers, Foley, and all the others I am leaving out... I can recognize all of them instantly... in or out of battle. I could do that since the beginning episodes.<br/><br/>The series is really too amazing to put into words. The acting is superb, as is the recreation of real events and the character developments (one extremely well development was Nixon's, starting with his drinking in the first episode which leads to his demotion from the regiment staff to the batallion staff in Episode 9.) The battle sequences are incredibly-well filmed. I feel like I know each of the characters. Scenes have been permanently drilled into my head, and I think about them long after I've seen the episodes (and I see each one multiple times.) Such scenes are the expression on George Luz's face after a shell hits Skip Muck's and Alex Penkala's foxhole outside Foy (ep 7), Joe Toye's constant "I gotta get up! I gotta get my helmet!" (ep 7), and Joe Liebgott's breakdown after explaining to the Holocaust survivors that they will need to say in the camp for just a little longer (ep 9).<br/><br/>The series is the most emotional thing I have ever seen, obviously the best film to ever be shown on any type of screen (counting both the big screen and the TV screen), and I give never-ending praise to the actors, the directors, and the crew members involved with it, as well as the real men of Easy Company and all the other men who fought in any company in any army in any war. When i heard of this mini-series coming out, i immediatly saved room on my calendar for this. Because Tom Hanks and Steven Spielburg were producing it, i was expecting a lot out of it. i tell ya, i wasnt disappointed! So far, every single episode ive seen has been impressing or VERY impressing. The cast does a totally phenominal job, with the only exception of David Schwimmer, who really cant pull off a war film and comes off seeming really sad.He comes off as too much of a "Friend". Damian Lewis is now a rising star, playing Cpt. Richard Winters with style and charisma. I was blown away how this series portrayed many hardships and problems that other movies never showed. This is the part of Saving Private Ryan that Spielburg never had time to film. I really hope this will come out on video, because it is way too worthwhile to miss! 'Band of Brothers' is tremendous. I liked 'Saving Private Ryan' a lot, because it had great war scenes, and was one of the few movies I've seen that doesn't glamourise violence, only showing it in its' pure, chaotic nature in which anyone can die in the blink of an eye. Thus, my love for 'Saving Private Ryan' is transferred to 'Band of Brothers' - Why? Because each episode is basically a minature 'Saving Private Ryan'! Brilliant!<br/><br/>Also, some people mention how it focuses too much on the Americans (like 'Saving Private Ryan' does, I'm sorry to say) - well, what do you expect, considering we're following an American company? Maybe if I were a bit more patriotic I would complain a little more, but I'm not really England crazy (Euro '96 is what finished that off - it brings a tear to my eye to think of that), so I think I'll stand by 'Band of Brothers' on this one.<br/><br/>The one problem it does have is that there isn't enough time to learn about each of the characters - I barely remember their names, which is a shame as I'd like to know who just died - but other than that, 'Band of Brothers' is about as good as TV can get. A masterpiece of entertainment! You all complain about not enough character development or this was that and blah blah blah, but this is movie tells you what EZ company went thru in the european campane.  We owe everything to these men.  Because of them, I have the freedom to choose a leader, I have the freedom to choose what job I want, goto school, live my life my way, not as Hitler's way, which for me would be death because I'm not blonde hair with blue eyes.<br/><br/>We all know that this was a World War and there were more than Americans fighting, so hush!!!  This was about EZ company!!! Not entire militaries. It would take a 100 part miniseries to sift thru and tell about all the stories about WWII.  So if you got 100 million dollars laying around to make a movie, you'll have to settle with this.  These stories are real, this actually happened.<br/><br/>They only had 10 hours to fit months of fighting into, so I can see why they didn't do a half an hour on each character.  They didn't have time for character development and also, most of these people took the ultimate sacrafice and were killed or wounded, so these characters wouldn't be on every episode.  And no it's not cool they had new characters in every episode cause that meant they were there to replace those who died, but that is what happened there and that is what is happening in telling the story.<br/><br/>I've seen 8 of 10 now, and its close to the demise of Germany.  So stay tuned!!!  This is the best mini series ever created. Band of Brothers was absolutely excellent. You just could not fault any of the acting, casting or directing. I must also say that Damien Lewis (an English actor) was also excellent, I don't think you could fault his accent either which was also very realistic. All in all I must say that "Band Of Brothers" is the most awe inspiring, graphic, intimate take on it's subject matter ever been shown on television. Thoroughly enjoyable and much effort was evidently made to insure technical accuracy. Even the Jagdpanther and STug IV looked well done. Although I'm sure that not all details were 100% accurate, it's by far more well done than any other military series. No exploding cans of fuel or 1000 round M-1 mags here. Bravo! I have read the book, which was one if not the best book I have ever read. The miniseries is very, very close to the book. I has to improvise but does it very good. All the actors do a wonderful job of playing them, expectally Damian Lewis(who plays Richard Winters, he should get every award, and the miniseries should too). The special effects, camera shots, scrpit, actors, direction, costumes, every was like how the book imagined it. I like how they have different directors for almost every episode, every one has a different feeling. I also like how the have the input of Ambrose and the guys who were acually there. I'm going to watch and tape every episode. Hopefully it comes out on vhs, so I can get it. I enjoyed "Band of Brothers" My Dad was Staff Sargent in The First Special Service Force in WWII. I found some similarity between some of his stories and a few of the scenes. I would like to see Tom direct a movie on the 1st Special Service Force. I just finished watching the fourth episode of this mini series.  I must say that it has been the best four hours of television I've ever watched.  I really enjoy the cast and the film style.  I read the other comments posted and noticed quite a few references to the soundtrack and the usage of the handheld camera during battle sequences-called nauseating by one reviewer. I would imagine it would be a bit more nauseating had any of us actually been there.  I haven't really noticed the music, either.  I just keep thinking that over 50 years ago these very normal men went to other countries, fought and died for America and freedom.  This is very relevant now, with the recent events in our country.  I think it's important to watch movies about the war, because we can never forget the people who actually lived those movies. Band of Brothers may not be perfect, but I think it is a wonderful tribute to the men of the real Easy Company.  They deserve much more than a 10 hour movie. One of the best warmovies i've ever seen!! It displays the things our liberators had to endure during WW2. Very realistic, but what did you expect when Steven Spielberg is in charge. Everybody should see this series, it's worth it!!!! I decided to watch the whole series, think about it, then watch it again before I posted.  One of the criticisms against BOB was that you couldnt tell the characters apart, and it is true.  Watching it the second time helped me identify names and faces early on that are emphasized later. The one criticism I have is that characters appeared and then disappeared for several episodes, I guess you can chalk it up to different directors using different stories.<br/><br/>But at the same time it allows for a variety of characters to each have an episode told through their eyes and thoughts (Roe, Lipton, Webster) or have subplots emphasizing them (Randleman, Blithe).<br/><br/>All of the actors performed beyond my expectations Damion Lewis was great, very believable.  My single favorite performance was by Shane Taylor as Doc Roe. Honorable Mention to Donnie Wahlberg who is a much better actor than singer and Ron Livingston did well in an underwritten role too.<br/><br/>My favorite episodes were probably Episode 3 "Carentan" and Episode 7 "Breaking Point".  Honorable mention goes to Episode 9 "Why We Fight" the subject matter was handled really, really respectfully.<br/><br/>PS: Tom Hanks is in the credits as a British officer but I sure didnt see him, and whats with the nepotism?<br/><br/>Overall 10/10. "Band of Brothers" is based on the Stephen Ambrose history of Easy Company, an airborne (paratrooper) unit in World War Two. HBO screened the second episode, plus clips from the other nine, for cable affiliates. The episode was directed by Richard Loncraine, best known for the Sting vehicle "Brimstone & Treacle" and the fine Shakespeare adaptation "Richard III," with Ian McKellen.<br/><br/>The hour opens with present-day interviews of real-life members of Easy Company, describing what it was like to parachute behind enemy lines under heavy fire in the dark of night. It then cuts to the dramatization of the paratrooper drop that preceded the D-Day invasion, with shots of the soldiers awaiting the orders to jump interspersed with views of the planes approaching the drop zones in the face of intense opposition. Little time is wasted on individual exposition; the sequence focuses on the sights and sounds that the warriors presumably experienced themselves. Casualties are heavy. On the ground, we follow various paratroopers as they encounter each other and try to find their way to rendezvous points. In essence, this is the back story for "Saving Private Ryan;" these soldiers were the ones assigned to taking out the guns that would pound the landing parties on Normandy later that day.<br/><br/>The groups coalesce, and the next morning, we follow Easy Company on its mission to take out a German gun battery. While not as graphic as "Ryan," the film nonetheless gives an unflinching view of the necessary brutality of combat and the harsh choices men must make to stay alive and accomplish their objectives. The assault on the battery is a fine piece of action filmmaking and editing; as in "Ryan," it is easy to place the various characters on the battlefield and their relationship to one another and the objective (unlike the battle scenes in "Pearl Harbor," which fell back on aimless explosions and running). The epilogue notes that the mission is still taught at West Point as a classic example of a successful assault on a fixed position, and the filmmakers make it easy to see why that is so.<br/><br/>The performances, by mostly unheralded actors, are sturdy, and their relative anonymity makes it easy to accept them in the roles. The battle effects get the job done, though some of the CG effects are obvious. The camera work is stellar - lots of handheld, relying on the point of view of the soldier to convey the chaos and methods of the battlefield.<br/><br/>All in all, "Band of Brothers" demonstrates the high standards that HBO is bringing to television, much like "From the Earth to the Moon" and "The Sopranos." It stands as one of the best films I've seen in a mediocre year for theatricals, and I suspect it would more than hold its own even in a good year. It certainly washes away the bad taste left by "Pearl Harbor," and I'm looking forward to the rest of the series. I just wish I could see the whole thing on a big screen, as I saw this segment. A group of clearly good men who have faith in god and love their own country fight against evil monsters. A lot of boom-boom, stupidly screaming Germans and women who trow themselves into their arms. I honestly don't see why this is so high rated. It's just an averaged war movie. Another... among thousands of similar movies. Brave Americans rescue the world. Some points are okay. Understanbale... but over all... i would have liked it better it the American soldiers there shown as normal men, not as heroic saints without any sign of a bad side. For example Liebgott is an interesting character, because he hates the Germans so much. I, as a German, clearly don't share his opinion but i understand it. But besides that, the Americans are still all good. They don't like the Germans (everyone of them) but they wouldn't commit war crimes. Also good: They came to the concentration camp and there shocked. Understandable. They suffered... a lot of them died. Yes, these there the things that gave quality to this series. To show the daily terrors and the pain. The bombed out Germany looked also very clean and healthy to me. You can easily see that the makers of the film wanted to say: They came away with it, almost unwounded. That's just historically wrong. Every German is a nazi and the soldiers are ss-men (historical also not true) and everyone who says that they lived ordinary lives just lies. <br/><br/>A point, that i really missed and that i find in movies like "All quiet at the western front" is the try to show the enemy as a human being. Everything i see here is a stupid, cruel enemy who makes everything wrong the foe does right. Psychologically bullshit, they were in likely situations so they will have probably behaved similar. All together. I haven't seen anything but a clichéd American hero war movie. Some shy attempts to show the American soliars as human beings with problems and shortcomings, but in the end an endless praise to themselves.<br/><br/>It's clear that an American series shows the American point of view and wants the audience to like the main characters, but that is just the point that ruins most war movies. Good versus bad doesn't work because in the situation (not the motives that led to the war) they are more alike than different. I'm sure people won't share my opinion, but i haven't seen anything outstanding. This must be the best tv mini series ever, from the first minute you believe that you are inside the ww2 , fantastic casting ,excellent work from everyone ,and all this from someone who never liked the usa army and believe that the other side,the Germans,have equal stories to tell but in the movies we see only the one side I finally saw this mini-series 2 1/2 years after its debut and I should be ashamed for waiting so long.  There are no weak points to this show.  The acting, directing, writing, stunts, effects, etc. all deserve A's. <br/><br/>
The mini is basically 10 character-driven episodes in chronological order as told by different members of Easy Company.  Episodes 4 and 9 are especially touching, about the liberation of Holland and the finding of concentration camps, respectively.  During parts of some episodes, the actual surviving 101st airborne members talk about their memories that are depicted in each episode.  The very ending quote of episode 10 is the greatest, where one member reflects on his grandson asking him if he was a hero during the war. He told his grandson he wasn't, but fought in the company of heroes.<br/><br/>That is what Band of Brothers is all about. 10/10 I'm not much of one for writing these kinda things, but this was perfection.... I don't think anything will ever be made again that will move me like this movie/series did! I cried through-out the movie and have no shame in admitting it either. What can one say about Band Of Brothers? This is probably the ten best movies (I intentionally don't say mini series) I've ever seen. There is so much detail, knowledge, and skill in these unbelievably powerful movies it took me a while to work up what I have seen. Perfect story (note that these are not really stories, but real happenings retold), perfect directing, perfect acting, perfect effects, perfect sound, perfectly authentic... the pure perfection! I bow down in front of the almighty gods who made Band Of Brothers. Mr. Spielberg, even tho you can sometimes be an arrogant f**k - I are totally belong to you!!<br/><br/>My ratings: not applicable, cause I'd give every single aspect 10/10.<br/><br/>My overall rating: 12/10! - A MUST SEE! A MUST HAVE! FOR EVERYONE! From the first moment to the last credits this is the best piece of TV ever made.  The stories totally captivate the viewer and I became engaged by the characters, especially Winters, who I willed to be okay every time danger came his way.<br/><br/>It is, essentially, impossible to find any significant fault with Band of Brothers. SPOILERS INCLUDED> If you liked SPR or BHD or WTF or anything like that you will adore the second war program that Spielburg has been involved in. THis one is not as gory as SPR but it has its moments. Like when Joe Toye (Kirk Acevado) gets his leg blown off. The body count is high, but then so is the amount of people that are great actors. You cannot tell dat this has a small budget, as the actors make up for dat fact.<br/><br/>IMDB rating: **********/********** I have watched this series about 3-4 times, and it gets better and better each time.  I always had interest in war films, and this was better than I could have ever wanted it. The filming is stunning.  You get so attached to the characters and develop a true appreciation for our war veterans.  What the war vets endured, most people will never know.  This series strengthened my love and devotion to American soldiers. I don't care if you're a democrat, independent, or a republican; the least we can do is support our soldiers.  I'd die before I oppose an action that our American soldiers are giving their life to accomplish.  Peace can only be accomplished through some acts of violence.  I am proud to be a loyal American. Band of Brothers is the standard by which all other war films will be judged.  This series is so captivating, you don't watch it; you live it along with the heroic characters.  Perfect casting and a compelling story. Best viewed uninterrupted with the lights low and the sound on 11! This is cinematic history right here. From the accurate research to the costumes. From the dialogue to the gritty realism. All of it could not have been executed any better. If i was a member of cast that featured in this mini-series i would be forever proud that i had been part of genius film making and ultimately....history.<br/><br/>10/10 Just saw episode 4. I thought the whole problem with dropping 10.000 men behind enemy lines was the lack of heavy equipment. This is well pointed out in movies like A Bridge Too Far. Yet, the guys are driving around in trucks and even have tank support. How, did those tanks get across the Rhine? For the rest, the style of conversation/shouting is like in any other WW2 movie, - I'm bored, and think I'll call it quits here. Just another reflection, could it be that this American infatuation with WW2 movies, comes from the fact that WW2 was clear from a good vs evil point of view and there was a resounding victory. The same can't be said about any other American military operation... I watched this many years after its initially release. Much hyped and told about among friends.<br/><br/>But frankly, I was bored. Oh my. What a long winded misery. Its a great production, but its boring.<br/><br/>Like watching a really great painting - you can see how nice it is, but you will never bring it home. Because looking at it again would bore you instantly. Band of Brothers has topped the IMDb rating, but why? Granted it was OK, but why has it been so over-hyped? It is basically a 10 hour version of saving private Ryan. Same cinematography, visual effects and direction. While I am a massive fan of war films, there are far superior films that haven't received half this recognition. For example, The Big Red One (containing Mark Hamil at his best), The Dirty Dozen, Paths of Glory, Kelly's Heroes, The Great Escape, Apocalypse Now, Platoon, Full Metal Jacket and list is endless. And I have one question, who on earth thought of casting David Schwimmer in a role where he would need to actually act well. He was as convincing as Mariah Carey in Glitter. This comment is here for anyone who has actually watched Band of Brother without buying into the hype. It is a good war series, but it pales in comparison to the works of John Sturges, Lee Marvin, Clint Eastwood, Sam Fuller, Stanley Kubrick (greatest director who ever lived!!!!!!) and the other true legends of war film I was very disappointed with Band of Brothers, having been persuaded by some of my friends in the industry who worked on it, that it was special. On their recommendation I bought the HBO HD DVD, 2010 version which is very badly authored, and takes about 10 minutes to load, with umpteen language versions all demanding that you pledge not to do various things.<br/><br/>Anyway, having got through that boring process, the next thing is some commentaries from USA veterans. Then into the main programme. This is slow and boring, never describing or showing the characters well enough. Few exciting moments, just the old old story of World War 2 with American overtones. Poorly written.<br/><br/>This show may have been popular when it was first released, but time has taken its toll! That's all you can say after this mini-series. WOW! Unfortunately I don't get HBO so I only caught 2 episodes, but those I saw were wonderful. If you like war movies, you'll love this mini-series. Enjoy! 4/5 stars for a mini-series--<br/><br/>JOHN ULMER I was lent this series by a friend of mine. The characters as I said, were more or less indistinguishable one from another. The battle scenes were repetitive and unrealistic (and endless) - you want to try running around in a "hail of lead"? Have you seen the embedded footage from Iraq and Afghanistan? Just doesn't happen. It's just another shoot-em-up for the computer game generation.<br/><br/>And it's not that I'm anti war-films. Saving Private Ryan was excellent. One of the best war films I've seen is "Das Boot" - don't know if you can still get the TV series with sub-titles, but it's absolutely outstanding.<br/><br/>I gave up at ep 3. My grandfather was a lieutenant colonel during World War II, so we have no food to eat now. Thanks America, if we have anything to thank. The delivery and quality is top notch. The camera handling is giving the feeling that we're standing there. The color and costumes and places all check out.My only problem is, that as far as I'm concerned...war is a much more precise and bloody affair, where certain scenarios have obvious written ll over them. The way these regiments were ordered was a multi-level defensive system, which cannot be broken in one major offense, it usually took days in cities. Weapons are also alright, apart from some sounds and the kickback. At many occasions the German troops show lack of the will to fight, and approx. 15 German troops don't carry on escaping when a .30cal is starting to shoot at them from 120 meters., it is a sudden death scenario where they turn back to try to take that mg out. This problem often occurs in the series, that axis troops always seem unprepared and eager to flee, however it was in the end-stage of WW2, this isn't how it was done. In any other aspect this series checks out fine. Oh I almost forgot...snipers were much more often on the battlefield of France and they were not lying on the fire escape, they were put to much more concealed positions. Episode 1:<br/><br/>This was a pretty good intro I must say. The actors were all good and the introduction was great. We got to know at least a little about the guy's we'd be seeing in this series. What really amazed me though, was the performance of David the FRIEND' Schwimmer. I'd have never thought he could play an a..hole so convincingly.<br/><br/>
7 out of 10<br/><br/>
Episode 2:<br/><br/>This episode was somehow a bit shallow' I felt. I know that is not the good word, but that was how I felt about this episode. Although this episode kind of focused around Winters, I could not really feel with him as I wished I could have. I was not drawn into his side of the story enough. This was basically an all shooting, non emotional episode from my point of view.<br/><br/>
7 out of 10<br/><br/>
Episode 3:<br/><br/>This episode was good, I must say. There were a lot of war scenes and this was until then, the most brutal episode. It really showed the brutality of war. The thing I liked best about this episode, was that it focused really on the bad side of the war, the injuries, the brutality and the sadness, which was impersonated by Private Blithe. Plus, you really felt for private Blithe.<br/><br/>
8 out of 10<br/><br/>
Episode 4:<br/><br/>David Schwimmer returns (however not too noticeable) in this episode. I felt that this episode was the best one I'd seen until then. I liked the mixture between war brutality, the liberation parties and the brutality by the Dutch people, shaving the heads of the moffenhoeren' (kraut-whores). A really good depiction of war as it was, as well for the soldiers as for the common and the uncommon people. Plus the war scenes were really thrilling.<br/><br/>
8 out of 10<br/><br/>
Episode 5:<br/><br/>Worst of the pack' until now, which does not mean that it was bad, but rather that it could have been so much better. This episode had great potential, but too little was made of Winters' war visions in the train and of his battle recollections. Tom Hanks really did not pick a great episode to direct, but at least it was not his fault this episode was not up to the other episodes standard.<br/><br/>
7 out of 10<br/><br/>
Episode 6:<br/><br/>This episode was filled with a lot of grim humour (which I (as a viewer) could laugh at) and the horrors of war. But the thing that made this episode somehow special was, that it was devoted almost entirely to medical personnel. I've never seen that before, so I thought it was quite original.<br/><br/>
8 out of 10<br/><br/>
Episode 7:<br/><br/>This episode focuses on one vital point of war and one thing that is caused by war and has brought down many soldiers even after the external war was over. The importance of a good leader, is vital to successful warfare. This episode really shows, that if you do not much of a leader, you will not fight well. The other thing is mental breakdown' as in the role of Compton. Seeing ones friends and fellow fighters being torn up, ripped to pieces and so on really destroys some people (whether it is during or after the war). It is the internal war that never ends.<br/><br/>
8 out of 10<br/><br/>
Episode 8:<br/><br/>This episode focuses on war as a game, namely getting prisoners of was just for fun'. I know it is pretty stupid to do such things, but it is the truth. It also shows us the view of another character in war: the returned soldier'. Letting Webster come back after 4 months does not only show, how the bonds have strengthened between the active' soldiers during that time, but also what happened to them on the emotional level. Good episode.<br/><br/>
8 out of 10<br/><br/>
Episode 9:<br/><br/>First I thought this would be a very cynical episode about what war is good for, but instead it turned out to be an episode about the real reasons for fighting World War 2. It showed the horror that the Germans caused and the good that all allied soldiers brought to Europe. This is the beginning of a great end for mankind and especially all the soldiers who fought on the winning side in World War 2.<br/><br/>
8 out of 10<br/><br/>
Episode 10:<br/><br/>This really is the best episode of them all. It brings peace back into the world, but not without accidents and sad moments, that are so stupid only life could have written them. The best thing about this episode is, that we are told what became of most of the men that were depicted in this film and that the recent interview scenes had the names of the men attached to them. I had been guessing for weeks who was who and if I was ever going to be told. I was told. The interviews at the end are great.<br/><br/>9 out of 10<br/><br/><br/><br/>Final conclusion:<br/><br/>This is really a good series. It is not so patriotic as some films are, you know with a heroes death at the end or a real happy ending. This series shows a big happy ending and lots of (a bit) smaller bad endings. Luck, bad luck, madness, horror, grief, sadness, astonishment, hate, patriotism and so on and so on. Imagine almost any emotion and you'll probably see it here. It was very realistic indeed. <br/><br/>
A thing that struck me, were the bits of interviews we saw (almost) every episode. You know, when I see those people, I see a lot of wise, brave and modest people. The best remark was (cited freely): I was no hero, but I fought with heroes'<br/><br/>
78 out of 100 Any adjective is superfluous for this divine play. When I first began watching historical films that portrayed real life events, I remembered feeling that each movie was like an absolute revelation. Whether I was watching Saving Private Ryan, Full Metal Jacket, or A Bridge Too Far, I had never experienced such gripping historical storyline scenes displayed in a movie before in my life. The next film viewed was Band of Brothers. I've seen a dozen historic war films but I have never seen anything quite like Band of Brothers.<br/><br/>An HBO and Tom Hanks production which portrayed World War II in the eyes of certain soldiers, Band of Brothers is an immersive, action packed film that also happens to be historically accurate. The movie takes place between 1942-1945. There is bonding, fighting, friendship, and bravery in this story that tells a lot about the men who were involved in this military conflict. Band of Brothers is a must watch if you love riveting and historically accurate war movies. Its ability to pull the viewer into the film and make you feel as if you are actually in the scenes make this movie a very, very, special cinematic experience.<br/><br/>The movie is about the story of Easy Company, the 506th Infantry Regiment of the U.S. Army 101st Airborne Division, and their missions in World War II in Europe. Those missions included Operation Overlord which liberated France and V-J Day, the date that Japan surrendered during World War II. The story is told through the eyes of the Easy Company regiment from their initial training starting in 1942 to the end of World War II in 1945 . The historical accuracy is what really caught my attention and was one of the reasons why I liked it. Although there are little things about this movie that aren't accurate because there are some events that you just can't recreate, and those scenes don't affect the overall quality of the movie at all. One of the producers of the movie, Tom Hanks, was interviewed about the inaccuracies. He stated that "even in movies that portray history, you have to make some changes so it is appealing to the audience."<br/><br/>In Band of Brother the movie portrays the airborne drops that were made during Operation Overlord(It happened a day before the operation at night). The objective of the airbore was to protect the flanks of the soldiers landing on the beacheads, as well as open up roadways to the interior. Six divisions landed on the first day; three U.S., two British and one Canadian. Paratroopers of the U.S. 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions(101st is Easy Company), the British 6th Airborne Division, the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion, and other attached Allied units took part in the assault. The paratroopers were assigned what was probably the most difficult task of the initial operation- a night jump behind enemy lines five hours before the coastal landings. When the paratroopers landed they were to cause confusion and disorganized the German forces. In the movie when they landed it is true that the airborne forces were scattered and disorganized, but the movie didn't show the U.S. airborne linking up with the soldiers that secured the beachhead. Instead Tom Hanks wanted to focus on the fierce fighting the paratroopers encountered when they landed. He wanted the audience to see the intensity of the fighting that happened that day. He thought it was better to just focus on the fighting rather than having the actors learn the combat formations the U.S. airborne used,which worked out because it still gave the feeling as if you were there during the operation. By doing this he kept the movie action packed and immersive for all his viewers.<br/><br/>A notable quote from the movie is "Brave men rejoice in adversity, just as brave soldiers triumph in war." The Easy Company soldiers heard these words before they were deployed into combat. Band of Brothers is immersive and historically accurate about how it portrays World War II. Unlike other war movies I have seen, this heroic tale depicts more relatable bonding, friendship, and bravery. The takeaway from Band of Brothers is that war happened and real people lived and died through the event. It is a historical film that portrays real life events. As George S. Patton would say: " It is foolish and wrong to mourn the men who died. Rather, we should thank God that such men lived." As we remember the sacrifices these men gave it is important that we continue to share their story to let people know such brave men lived. I recommend this movie for those who are into history and love action/war films. Maybe if your not interested about the history you might like the plot of the story which pretty good overall. This movie does an amazing job of showing World War II and its history. Band of Brothers has received lots of award like the Golden Globe Award, this is given to the best miniseries or television, for best Miniseries or Television film. Where to begin?
It's very rare that I'd buy a box set of a tv series. I must have watched this one over a dozen times.
I could waffle on about the fantastic effects and the excellent array of acting talent, but all that should never take away the brutal reality of the storyline.
Now I'm not a flag waving patriotic type, who gets a kick out of war and guns, but the people this series is based on and many many others like them, put their lives on the line for us and Band of Brothers shows a mere snippet of what it must have been like to suffer and witness the hardship and horrors of war.
You must watch this amazing series, especially the documentary featuring the real men from Easy Company. Have tissues on standby. Absolutely a magnificent story. Great acting and production quality. It is quite amazing as to how the actors play their parts. I've seen many WWII films and series on TV, and this is the best example of that horrible time. It is a solemn tribute to those in Easy Company. Thank you, Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg and many others who were involved in the early phases of this extraordinary mini-series. Their vision and passion to produce the story of a group of men in their journey towards the end of the worst/greatest war in history. War is disgusting and leaves no one as a winner, but it is also tough to determine how the world would now be if the Nazis and Japanese had won that brutal battle for freedom and liberty and the chance for others to experience these beliefs. First of all, HBO has done its miracle again!I don't know where to start...This series is a must watch to those who love war-drama movies!The awesome thing with this series is that it surpasses the war and also vividly describes the lives of the Soldiers and their feelings and the camaraderie they have developed towards to each other!However, it also contains graphic violence in order to enhance their already perfectly described battles!Moreover, the accuracy of the historic version of the series is astounding!Last but not least, the thing with the war veterans talking in the beginning or the end of each episode is mind blowing(you don't know who they are until the very end)! If one views Band of Brothers only for its entertainment value then one is missing the true value of this series. Band of Brothers provides a perspective on war which is rarely ever shown in Hollywood films, which tend to glorify war as if it was some honorable act. The message in Band of Brothers is one which tells us, without having to stand on the battle field, what it is truly like to see the carnage, the trauma it leaves in its wake and the damage it incurs upon the human soul. The choreography and realism aside, which is magnificent, it is difficult to watch without being exposed to the brutal reality of people killing one another, and Spielberg and Hanks, who produced the series, deserve a Nobel Peace prize for the message proliferated by this series, as much as any man or woman standing out there pushing the message of peace. Band of Brothers tells us this; war is not glory and there is no honor in killing another human being in the name of battle - there is only the compromise of one's deepest and most quintessential brotherhood with all people. It is a message which this world needs to hear over and over again so that people start to rally to it, and not to the call of politicos and war generals, and their backers, the corporate and banking institutions who feed off the war machinery and the spilled blood, like bottom-feeders in the food chain. Well done Spielberg, Hanks and all involved. Author of Twilight Visitor Band of Brothers is a ten-part, 11-hour television World War II miniseries, originally produced and broadcast in 2001, based on historian Stephen E. Ambrose's 1992 book of the same title. The executive producers were Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, who had collaborated on the 1998 World War II film Saving Private Ryan.The episodes first aired in 2001 on HBO. They still run frequently on various TV networks around the world.<br/><br/>The series dramatizes the history of "Easy" Company (part of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division) from jump training in the U.S. through its participation in major actions in Europe, and up until Japan's capitulation and war's end. The events portrayed are based on Ambrose's research and recorded interviews with Easy Company veterans. The TV series took literary license, adapting the recorded history for the purposes of dramatic effect and series structure. All of the characters portrayed are based on members of Easy Company. Some of the men were recorded in contemporary interviews, which viewers see as preludes to each episode. The men's identities are not revealed until the finale.<br/><br/>The title for the book and the series comes from the St. Crispin's Day Speech in William Shakespeare's play Henry V, delivered by Henry V of England before the Battle of Agincourt. Ambrose quotes a passage from the speech on his book's first page; this passage is spoken by Carwood Lipton in the TV series' final episode. Brilliant WW2 drama. Easily the best WW2 TV series ever made, and one of the greatest ever TV series, full stop. <br/><br/>Based on Stephen Ambrose's novel of the same name, the movie is incredibly accurate in its depiction of WW2 military and action. It's not surprising that Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg are executive producers, as the special effects and action scenes are very reminiscent of Saving Private Ryan. <br/><br/>However, the movie isn't just about the action. Its about all the other stuff that goes on in war - training, deploying, waiting to go into action, general down-time and, most importantly, the bond between the men in a unit. The latter is actually really what the series is about (hence the series' name). It also gives us an incredible final scene, one which always leaves me very emotional.<br/><br/>An absolute must-see. There is not one thing I would possibly need to/have to change about this incredible war series. It's my all-time favorite war series/movie. Saving Private Ryan was good, but not as good as Band of Brothers. Band of Brothers shows you how close these unrelated men are, how much they depend on each other. Other war series/movies I've seen have never shown as much depth in relationships between the soldiers, the characters. That's pretty much what this series highlights, the close, tight nit relationship/bond these men have. The props, costumes, explosions, artillery, it's all so amazing and realistic. It's astonishing to see how this all came together to make the series perfect. In my opinion, The Pacific still wasn't as good. I hope HBO's next rumored series is just as good, if not, even better. Executive produced by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, this miniseries clearly shows the influence of Saving Private Ryan, but provides an even richer experience.<br/><br/>Like Private Ryan, this takes the viewer into the middle of the battles, often chaotic, bloody, brilliantly filmed, and all the more impressive that this was made for TV.<br/><br/>The cast are excellent, though if there's a flaw, it can sometimes be hard of keeping track of who's who among the supporting characters.<br/><br/>The most heart-wrenching episode brings us more in the vein of Schindler's List, as Easy Company discover a concentration camp.<br/><br/>There is not a duff episode in the 10-part series. Even the final episode, taking place after Germany has surrendered, ends the show on a high. How can you rate something that is beyond conventional ratings? This series is not a show, it's a piece of history came to life. We, living in the modern age, are tend to forget what happened more than half century ago to our grand parents, who sacrificed so much so we can have a future. This series made me remember of the war stories that my grandfather used to tell ,when I was a kid. He always told funny stories, yet there were times that he couldn't talk and just sit quietly. He died when I was a kid, and till this day, I'm guilty that I didn't really thought about him that much. Now I'm 31 years old with two kids of my own. I admit, this series made me cry, and memories came flooding back. I will protect my kids from all the harm, but this is something that I will definitely pass along, when they can handle it. It's hard to watch, yet it's a must.<br/><br/>update from 2020. Watch the episode the one before last. I can't. The tears flow through my eyes, how real it is . I'm 40 now and this is something that is must see for all to remember. This mustn't be. At all Never. remember this, for all races concerned. Contents of BoB: 10 parts + Bonus episodes = Complete satisfaction.<br/><br/>BoB starts off with a bang with "Curahee" and continues its relentless pace of action throughout the majority of the series. It also has a few episodes where you have a chance to catch your breath like "Bastogne" and "Points". It has full action-packed episodes like "Day of Days", "Carentan", "The Breaking Point" and "The Last Patrol". The series really stuck a chord with me because of the realism and accuracy shown to the viewers. I really felt emotionally attached to the men of "Easy Company" and all the emotions that the soldiers felt was be sensed by me. The sets are perfect, the effects are remarkable {war visuals were the most stunning you will ever see}, and the background score connected well with the series. I'm not an American but all the Americans should be mighty proud of the sacrifices these Men made for today's generation. I felt inspired by these guys {just look at their faces...18-19 yr olds fighting a war so that others can sleep peacefully}. Not to forget the EDITING of the series. It was truly an outstanding idea to bring in the real War-Veterans on the show and add their interviews to it. Also, the idea of showing the significance of each part before the credits was fantastic.<br/><br/>Few of the lines in the series were truly remarkable and hair-raising like the following: "For he who today sheds his blood with me...shall be my brother" and many more to list down {basically, whatever the Veterans said touched me deeply}.<br/><br/>But my favourite conversation will always remain: ***<br/><br/>Do you remember the letter that Mike Ranney wrote me?<br/><br/>...You do?<br/><br/>Do you remember how he ended it?<br/><br/>''l cherish the memories of a question my grandson asked me the other day. . .when he said, 'Grandpa, were you a hero in the war?'<br/><br/>Grandpa said, 'No. . .but l served in a company of heroes.' ''<br/><br/>*** The above statements appear at the end of the 10th part and from the first time I heard till date, I always cry hard...Its the most touching line I've ever heard in a motion picture {there have been many great lines but this one comes straight from the bottom of the heart and pierces right through my soul}. Speechless!!!<br/><br/>Overall, this series is a great achievement in the history of Motion-Picture, according to me.<br/><br/>-----------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>There is always a small group of people who oppose to the widely accepted HIT movies or T.V.Shows. Currently BoB has 9.6/10 on the IMDb and I will never understand what is there not to like in BoB. I know its the matter of opinion and these things are always subjective BUT after reading a few HATE comments, I realised none of them had a SOLID point to dislike the series. Most of the comments were just repeating the "It was BORING" crap without giving one clear explanation of why they felt that way. I pity these people, who IMO were switched off while watching this series and that could've let them to hate it. All I can say is these people missed out on a very rare and special series and if they ever read my comment please for your own sake try to watch this again with more open mindness and maybe you will understand why its rated so highly.<br/><br/>BUY these DVDs and keep them with you for the rest of your life...I'm sure you will watch them 'N' number of times.<br/><br/>My rating: 9.9/10 Band of brothers is a great world war 2 miniseries that I highly recommend for anyone a fan of the genre from executive producers Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks. The whole cast for the most part are great (except for David Schwimmer no offense) in their roles including Eion Bailey, Damian Lewis, Ron Livingston, Michael Cudilitz, Matthew Settle, Dexter Flecher, Neal McDonaugh, Ross McCall, and Donnie Wahlberg. The rest of the cast are good in their parts as well. Band Of Brothers has intense realistic graphic war violence giving audiences a look at what these men went through back then, character development, drama, betrayals, suspense, a little romance, and some humor which make for an an entertaining and genuinely gripping miniseries to watch. Parents should be wanted to see Band Of Brothers first before deciding if their children are old enough to watch it. This is an excellent miniseries I was very impressed with because it's based on a true story about brave men who risked their lives for our country which deserves to be told. Up until a few days ago, I had only seen this miniseries in broken clusters of the episodes, on the History Channel. I knew I liked it but there was the disruption in the continuity.<br/><br/>Then I got the 6-disk boxed edition for my birthday and everything changed. From that point, what was already a really good story took off and became great. Played in order over a period of two days, the story leaped from the screen and easily initiated a suspension of the natural disbelief you have when watching any movie. The characters, locations and drama melded in a way that I have never seen in anything before. The closest to come to this level of cinematographic and acting excellence is... maybe, Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/>I should note that I really do enjoy immersing myself into movies. The goal is, of course, reaching that threshold where you and the story become one; that aforementioned suspension of disbelief.<br/><br/>Everyone is different but speaking strictly for myself, after watching Band of Brothers, every other war movie of the genre now pales and seems so obviously contrived. Even something as well done as Flags of Our Fathers, seems a lesser product.<br/><br/>This series has effectively altered my perception of the art of acting, directing and cinematography. It also leaves some mighty big shoes to fill for anything that ever hopes to come close.<br/><br/>You will come away with a deep appreciation of the real Easy Company of the 506 PIR, and so too those actors who took their roles in recreating those pivotal moments so critical in history.<br/><br/>* For any war movie fan, I recommend the 6-disk set that includes (Disk 6) Ron Livingston's Video Diaries.<br/><br/>... This is a very good show. What I think is so great about this series is that it does not feel like a Television show. The two episodes I saw today told two different stories. The first told the story of the Airborne troops. It was a very good episode but that one felt more like a television show than the other one but it was very well done. There were none of the normal television drawbacks such as cheesy acting, or very poor special effects. This show had very good acting and excellent special effects. All of the battles looked more real than that of most TV series. The show did a very good job of showing the bond between the soldiers and the difficulties they had to endure. I only saw two parts of this series, yet I was still amazed by each one. It is the story of the Easy Company from the 101st Airborne Division. These men are dropped behind enemy lines and are called to fight their way out. Each part starts with interviews from actual Easy Company soldiers which add such an authentic and realistic feel that no actor can duplicate. The battle scenes resemble other great war movies such as Saving Private Ryan and are done with great excellence. The battle scenes have a remarkable realistic look and feel. This film goes where most films would not and shows the true colors of World War II. It shows the rough life of the soldiers and shows the viewer what those brave soldiers had to sacrifice in order for our country to be what it is today. the band of brothers is an extremely moving tale of heroism and bravery. This mini series is an accurate representation of how brutal and horrible warfare is. the graphic scenes and screams of agony put a person right there in the action. i enjoyed watching these movies more than midway. partly because i think the acting in these are better, and partly because i think that these were done better. i feel that this show was targeted to more males than the females. there is a considerable amount of blood and gore, along with violence and quite a few choice swears. but, that is what makes this shows good. anyone who likes to see war movies and enjoys these gruesome spectacles will like this show. we have to keep in mind while watching this that war is hell, and many fine American men gave their lives for the continuing freedom of this country and so that other could live free of tyranny. This miniseries grabbed my attention in 2001 when I was in Grade 12. It was very interesting as history was one of my subject and we handled World War Two but never about Americ's involvement in it. So, when I had the chance to watch Band Of Brothers it was an eye-opener. I really recommend this series to anyone who loves history in all its glory. Whether you are German, Frence, even South African this series really just makes you watch it from the beginning to the end without ever making you think but certain events did not happen or a scene is exploiting the truth. I just really think no other war movie or series can come close to the greatness of Band Of Brothers. The actors portraying the soldiers are very convincing and they put emotion into to every scene with such enthusiasm. If you are an emotional person, like me, some scenes will make you cry (just like a typical girl).In all you won't regret buying the series as it is really, really brilliant! this was the best series ever. I am in the AFJROTC (Air Force Junior ROTC) in high school, and i have seen hundreds of war series, movies and documentaries, and this was by far the best one i have ever seen. i actors did a great job and your can really tell the H**l these men from the 506 Regiment of the 101st Airborne Easy Company went through and it shows you what war is like. my dad is in the Air Force and He went to Iraq for a while and when he returned he had loads of stories to tell. this series was the best thing on television to date. I loved it!!!!! Go USA!!!!!!!! WE ROCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! While on my way to work one morning in June 2000 I came through Gare St Lazare (Nth West Paris) and saw people dressed in 1940's clothing getting out of commercial buses and going into the station. There was one guy coming up the escalator dressed in an American officers uniform with loads of medals, summer fatigues not battledress. He was speaking in French. Outside there was a lady directing people off of the buses and into the station. She was holding a sign which said Band of Brothers. Obviously these people were extras going by train to shoot a scene. Does anybody know which part was filmed in France? I can't see anything on the credits. You could almost explain all of World War II with this mini-series. It shows, from an American GI perspective, what the training and fighting were like for the men fighting Hitler's Germany. The detail is staggering; the historical accuracy spot on. It was mesmerizing in so many ways. This is truly what TV Drama should be about.<br/><br/>Damian Lewis is the standout actor of an outstanding cast. His air of decency and authority say almost as much as the real men of Easy Company said about his character, Major Winters.<br/><br/>The score, by Michael Kamen, is one of the best ever produced for any movie or TV show. I can only imagine how Ex.Poducer Tom Hanks must have felt when he first heard the score put to his footage. Haunting, inspiring,spiritual, are only a few words to describe it.<br/><br/>Every school child in America should see this series in American History Class. The horror and honor of what these men did and saw done can not be explained by just reading History books.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and buy the DVD and watch it with each member of your family. It is what America used to be all about, and should be again. My highest recommendation! Truly a jewel that can be cherished and passed on to free generations to come. Amazingly is added on top of this masterpiece of film. Amazingly true. I'm as suspect as anyone who may criticize this great nation, our government, president, or aspects of our heritage. This great privilege was not; was not God-given, but given by men like Buck Compton, Shorty Powers, Bill G., and Maj. Dick Winters and those that fought under him. I can't say enough about these men that abandoned their lives and their limbs for me. And my granddaughter. Band of Brothers will ignite a passion in you that persuades patriotism, hope, and tears for those fallen. I now celebrate their honor and memory on this counter's' day of Memorial. Spielberg and Hanks; of course it's damn good. Add on the amazingly true and you've positioned yourself for the greatest film experience of ones' life. Filmmakers, actors, musicians; sure I'd like to meet. Any member of Easy Company I would meet I'd simply stand in awe and cry. The criticism melts while the pride swells. The "Band of Brothers" series is one of the most dramatic and real life films i have seen. It depicts the lives of the Easy Company men who fought during World War II. This film does not portray these men as hero's or heroric but rather men who set out to do a task and performed it to the best of their ability. The men of Easy Company are portrayed superbly by the actors. This film shows the real life horrors and brutality of war. The courage these men needed to perform their duty towards their country no matter what the consequence was. With people being shot around them, limbs being blown off, trees falling down these men did not let this get in their way they joined together and become united to fight one enemy. "Band of Brothers" is divided into 10 episodes with a different plot to each. This film is the most captivating and emotional war film i have seen. I was sad when it ended, it is the most compelling war drama I have ever seen. I can't believe they spent all that money on a mini series! The scenes are feature film quality. The sets realistic and perfect. Character development was a little slow at first but well worth the wait. Because there are so many different characters it can become a bit confusing but "war is hell"! The inclusion of commentary by the actual participants was an excellent dramatic effect and made the story even more interesting. I viewed the DVD version and the extras are also very well done and add much to the viewing experience. This is not only entertainment but education as well. Finally, philosophically it shows war as it really is, a horrible thing. Heroes are unlikely and become that way out of necessity. I pray for our men and women out there! When I first heard of this series and heard that Tom Hanks was involved, I thought this series would turn out to be another Saving Private Ryan. I was totally wrong. The series is so well put together that I actually had a problem finding a stopping point each night. The cast of characters, mostly unknowns except for Damian Lewis, Donnie Wahlberg, and David Schwimmer, brought a good mix of familiar talent along with the new. The new talent also seemed to make the story more believable. You get to follow a group of paratroopers from Easy company from basic training to the last days of the war. The story is so well written that you actually feel like a part of their group and when someone dies, you miss their character. Each chapter of the story has footage of the real men the characters are playing talking about the events that happened at the time of the war. In my opinion, this was an extreme bonus because it set the mood for each mini-part and reminded you that you were not just watching a Hollywood fictional story. The only downer to the story was the chapter about the field medic. I felt that, even though the field medics surely must have gone through a lot and seen so much death, this part of the story was overkill. The bottom line for the series is that it is the best war series that I will probably ever see in my lifetime, the acting and storyline are superb and if you have not seen this series, I would strongly recommend it. Take caution letting small children watch this film as there are some pretty graphic scenes of wounded soldiers. Band of brothers is by far the best WW II i've ever saw and even best movie/mini series . Whats so excellent about it is how the producers inserted the real veterans comments into the stories and that created that bond between the men , a bond like the German general said at the end can be found only in combat . Bill Guarneere , Joe Toy , Malarkey , Sgt. Lipton , Spears , WINTERS , Nixon , Eugene , Compton , Shifty Powers , Bull , Perconte , Webster all real heroes turns up in the end which gives <br/><br/>the whole production monumental proportions ... and perhaps i liked this movie/mini-series so much is because i can relay to the paratroupers cuz i also practice parashouting and that feeling on dday must have felt 10 times the excitement of my first jump . The last two episodes war dreamlike the contrast between the war and the paradise at the end in Austria in the Alps with that soundtrack ahhh to beautiful to describe in words ... Somehow, i knew very little of this mini series, other than it had David Schwimmer in and that it was an American miniseries ! But a few years down the line and I got hold of a copy from CDwow and sat down to watch the first disc.....then the next.........then the next.<br/><br/>Two days later, I just want to tell the whole world that this is possibly the most amazing production I have ever watched.<br/><br/>You are just drawn into Easy Company and feel every raw emotion of every one who served in it.<br/><br/>Compulsive viewing is an understatement. Saving Pte Ryan was always good - but seems so much in your face and rushed after BoB's. Give this the respect it deserves - lights out, phone off and indulge. Band Of Brothers is simply the best piece of film making I have ever seen. While I may be a little biased towards WWII films, I found BoB to be nearly perfect in every way. I first saw a few episodes on HBO, and immediately got hooked. The DVD set is the reason I first bought a DVD player, and when the disc set came out, I was first in line to pick it up. BoB has amazing character development, outstanding special effects, brilliant dialog, and a level of emotional emersion that has never been reached by any other film, whether being seen on the big screen, or television. Although, I have never experienced war, the series seems to touch on every intricate aspect of war, and our soldiers that fought in it. It's a very emotional series, but still retains all the action that a good war film should. When you watch the films, you will easily get attached to the characters, how they relate to each other, and each individual's personality. George Luz, Harry Welsh, and Lewis Nixon were my favorite characters. No other film can develop individual characters like Band Of Brothers. You might get so caught up in them, that you'll forget you're watching a film about World War 2. If the first episode bored you, don't give up on it. Episode 2 is when the action hits the fan. I can't say much more than it was absolutely amazing. It was shot perfectly. The fact that Hanks and Spielberg had decided to de-saturate the film was perfect. It made everything seem dark and dingy how it would be. It drew away from the bright colours. I thought the mise en scene was phenomenal. Even thought a lot of it was CGI (and the best CGI I've seen for a while) it was still amazing. In episode 8/9 when the soldier is having sex with a woman made me laugh so much. It was serious but it still had its funny parts. Most of it being the dialect between Easy Company. I'd suggest it to anybody. Damian Lewis blew me away... I'm a very impatient person and for me to sit through a 90 mins movie even if it is very exciting is often a chore. But every time i get to see Band of Brothers, I would be very excited and not even bothered by the 10 episodes each lasting about 75 mins. And for me to actually watch the show 5 times and still want to watch it again is considered a achievement.<br/><br/>Part of the reason for this maybe because I'm a war buff, i like every war film that i have seen. And my friends have taken to brand me as the War Film geek. <br/><br/>BUT the actual reason for me really really loving this film is what Hanks and Spielberg managed. The portrayal of War as being real, main characters do have a chance of getting hurt unlike films which shows main characters as being bullet elusive. They also managed to show the realness of war, the cruelty of war, the comradeship that the men had. How they depended on each other to get through tough situations like at the Ardennes Forest and at Camp Toccoa. What i feel really made this miniseries a success is the excellent portrayal of human feelings. <br/><br/>In every part of the show, they manage to show soldiers in different situations and how they react. Often i have found myself laughing at what the soldiers have laughed at and felt immense sadness when the soldiers lose something or are under severe depression/sadness. Like at the German Concentration Camps where the Jewish comes hugging the Americans, i feel just like how the soldiers must have felt then or when the attack on Foy was not successful because of Dike's inability to lead well. I was able to feel Winter's frustration at seeing men he loved and fought with getting popped off simply because he was not in active command of them. Happy moments includes times where the soldiers rigged the lottery so that Shifty was able to go home or when Buck was having a dart game and Luz came up and told him to shoot properly.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a great show and that tells war as war is and not glamorize it. What the soldiers have been through and what they have done is really something remarkable.The effort Hanks and Spielberg put in to making it as realistic as possible is also something spectacular in its own way. I am amazed! Just finished the final episode of "Band of Brothers," and I must say: WOW. I am SO impressed! Not like anything I have ever seen before - and probably the best ten hours spend in front of the TV ever. This movie has so many moving moments, so many realistic war scenes and so many scenes, that drew tears to my eyes! And not only mine - my boyfriend (who NEVER cries I might add) cried as well. Maybe because he was in the army, and kinda knows about the special bond the movie is all about. Or maybe because it got us thinking about how we in this world haven't learned anything from the tragegies and horror of WW2. The war, the friendship, the deaths, the survivors, the Germans, the concentration camp, the German general - the band of brothers. Simply excellent, that's all I can say. Watch it! - then you'll know, what I mean! These are great Series, they are not just a war story they also talk about the Brother relation that the soldiers had even in the worse war of all the times. Saving Private Ryan also talks about this war, but Band Of Brothers shows many other points of view, it has a real story and the Searies show many real events, they show the truth of the originals events, without non real scenes. it shows real dialogs, and an impressive story and Characters. For understand how wonderful is this story you have to watch The Extra DVD, you will see of what i'm talking about.<br/><br/>The drama and war events together make a really good series, it is very long so it shows many aspects of how was the WWII, military operations, impressive events, and real heroes, everything can be summarize in...<br/><br/>"Band of Brothers". HBO's ten part mini-series on the "Easy" Company's tribulations during the German invasion of World War II is a grand spectacle, filled with numerous moments of perfection, and begs one simple question. Why can't the rest of television look like this? Based on the book by Stephen Ambrose, and produced by Tom Hanks and Stephen Spielberg, the series gives a realistic, gut-wrenching portrayal of Easy Company's activities from the final stages of their paratrooper training, to D-day, through their major battles up until the end of the war. It spans 10 hour long episodes (the series opener "Currahee" clocks in at 1 hour, 30 minutes), with each episode focusing on a particular battle front, and often specific characters. It gives a good portrait of what war must be like to those who actually fight it. It does not shy away from the brutal, ugly reality of combat. It is not just the Saving Private Ryan like battlefield violence (though there is plenty of that here) but the cold blooded murder of German prisoners, and the cowardice of boys trying to be soldiers. This is not John Wayne standing gruff and courageous against fascism. Band of Brothers does well to show that not all soldiers were courageous; all were scared, some so much to be rendered useless.<br/><br/>Each episode spotlights one or more of the men. In doing so it gives the audience a chance to view the soldiers on a more personal level, and not just their heroics. While doing so, the episodes also spotlight the types of struggles the soldiers dealt with day to day. While mainly this technique worked, there were a few missteps. Instead of using an entire episode to highlight the medics, I would have preferred those moments to be seen throughout the series. Medics were in constant need while on the battlefront, and to see this in detail, intertwined into every episode, would have served the purpose better. Instead I would rather have seen another soldier highlighted (Nixon comes to mind.) Likewise the Normandy invasion seemed underwhelming. Easy company was part of a paratrooper division which flew over the beaches and fought their way back. Following the company, we miss much of what was the D-day invasion. Instead we find the soldiers taking out a few machine gun nests. Though this may be historically accurate, it seems disappointing not to see more of what is one of the most significant battles of the 20th century. I suppose I'll have to watch Saving Private Ryan for that.<br/><br/>These are minor complaints in what is ultimately, an excellent series. It is a joy to see such an excellent production come out of a television series. HBO proves once again that it is at the top of the television game. The networks need to take a long, hard look at their cable competitors and see how they can produce quality productions.<br/><br/>Like this review? Go to www.midnitcafe.blogspot.com for more. This is quite simply an awesome cinematic treat...........An absolute must see compilation. The first Espisode (curahee) was fairing on the average side (David S/Ross Gellar - I just couldn't get his Friends character from my mind), but once past that I was completely hooked. This was an assault on all of the senses quite literally......If you have a decent home cinema system ...the volume must go up - especially in the conflict scenes!!! I went through all disks over 2 days and was absolutely gutted when I had finished watching all of them......Mr Spielberg/Hanks I Salute you (no pun intended) we really need more of this high quality material............In my opinion this is the holy grail of war movies/compilations.......Outstanding!!!!!!!!!!!! This is hands down the best piece of cinematography I have ever had the privilege to enjoy. It's told through the lives of the men of Easy Company, 101st airborne division, 506th regiment during the European Tactical offensive of World War II. Through superb acting and directing, this story is told with flawless efficiency. Not only is it historically accurate, but it is also a compelling drama which pulls you in, in such a way that you actually care about each of these characters. I'm thankful that two great film makers could come together to chronicle the lives of the hero's who made the ultimate sacrifice in the name of good. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys war films, and documentaries, as well as someone who just enjoys great acting, and flawless story telling. Band of Brothers will change your life. This story base on a military company called Easy Company. Their name is Easy Company but they are the toughest,strongest, fastest, smartest, and most loyal company America can offer. This movie gives the audiences a taste of what World War 2 was like in a soldier uniform. Dick Winter is like one of the best leader yet and he is so calm when his company is under attack. The only thing that the director miss was to tell the audiences if the rumor about Ronald Speirs shot 20 German soldiers after he gives them cigarette was fake or true. With everything else its great, I give the directors a lot of credits. After I watch this movie, i would like to be in the Easy Company during 1944 and to taste it at first hand. oh my god i Loved the mini series(and quite a few of the guys in it) this is a brilliant series to purchase, (in england is aprox. £50 for special set) if you are like me, you're really interested in world war 2 (not in a morbid way though)i think that mainly goes for the blokes, or if you're a girl(or gay or bi bloke) if you LURV good looking guys this is the mini series for you. from episode one through to episode ten it takes you through what the men of easy company went through, throughout the entire time they were involved in the war. there are some really mind-blowing performances, Scott grimes as don malarkey, Shane Taylor as Eugene 'doc' roe and Damien lewis as dick winters just to name a few of the superb cast which consisted of both American and British actors, all of whom you couldn't tell which were or were not American, the accents were so good, but we not only had American accents but accents from different states in America.<br/><br/>brilliant. Two episodes of Band of Brothers have now aired where I live and I'm stunned. No doubt the best TV has to offer for the moment.<br/><br/>For an American warmovie BoB is surprisingly realistic. After seeing films like Pearl Harbour I had, to be honest, given up all hope in American movies in this genre. The Americans are portraited somewhat better then their enemies, but you can live with that. At least they're not any superhuman, Rambo-fighters.<br/><br/>Being a series BoB has a great advantage over similar 2h-movies. It includes so much more. You get a much better picture of what the war was like.<br/><br/>Many of the characters are quite funny. They contribute with a good contrast to the brutal war.<br/><br/>Please, if you haven't seen any Band of Brothers episodes yet, do it now! Jumping in to it in the middle of the series is no problem. This is perhaps the best II war TV series ever made. Congratulations to all the directors and the stuff! After I have read the critics on imbd i didn´t hesitate to buy these 10 part super mini TV series on DVD. I am proud to add it in my best of collection.<br/><br/>This film helps really inspiring and to understand what happened to the heros at that time. The documentation of the veterans is a great testimony and well accompanied at the beginning in each part.<br/><br/>I liked very much the introduction beginning with the training of the Easy Company. Then the second part enjoy how production house "Dreamworks" starts to present the best special effects airborne I have seen in war movies. Then the invasion in Normandy was similar to the one in "Saving Private Ryan" and that was very hard but top. The house bomb explosions were great. At the end of the series i was very impressed by the jewish camp. In the last part "Points" superb pictures of the Austrian villages and mountains.<br/><br/>Don´t miss it, I highly recommend it. 9/10. i watched this great mini serie the last days on dvd and i have to say that it was great, real realism, very good actors, good storyline. i often watch ww2 movies, also i watched a lot of ww2 dokumentaries. only thing i missed in ryan and bob is the other side, yeah i mean the german side. it would be more tolerant to show that also the "krauts" lost millions!!! of soldiers, and nearly everyone of these soldiers were NO nazis ! although most of all germans were NO nazis. the german soldiers had also fear in combat, also lost their friends under fire, had also wife and kids at home, do you remember those ~300.000 german pow dying in russia ?! would be nice to see something like bob showing more than only the american side finally all of us should remember all soldiers/civilist who died in ww2, no matter from which side ! If you are a fan of war films, this is an absoulute must see.  It tops my list of movies, even if it is a mini-series.  The action and story line of the 101st airbourne division is right on target.  The acting is superb from all actors, and could not be done any better.  The cuts from the documentary of the real soldiers of easy company are touching and makes you fell like you were right along with them in this historical event.  If it is up to the standards of the actual war heroes, it is up to mine.  A must see classic that should be considered to be added on the top 250 list of movies under the asterik of a mini series, because it is ranked higher then the godfather.   Besides when Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks present it how could it not be Excellent. An absolute 10! It finally dawned on me why "Band Of Brothers" has a 9.5 rating while "Saving Private Ryan" has a rating of only 8.3.  "Band Of Brothers" was watched by a bunch of couch potatoes like myself who may have never seen "Saving Private Ryan."  Tom Hanks and Tom Sizemore are a hard combination to beat, not to mention putting the Normandy (beach) invasion and the push inland against the longer and less detailed and less intimate story of Easy company which only touches on such operations as Market/Garden, a very important loss for the Allies and an operation that was explained in a somewhat confusing manner in "Band Of Brothers."  <br/><br/>Add to this the fact that some 8000 people who use IMDb voted on "Band of Brothers" while well over 77,000 voted on "Saving Private Ryan," placing "Saving Private Ryan" at position number 56 on the top 250 rated movies of IMDb's list.  The ratio of total votes comparing the two productions is almost 10 to 1 for "Saving Private Ryan."  But then IMDb is a marketing tool for Amazon.com, an observation that will no doubt place my comment way down the line on the "Band Of Brothers" page(s), if it's approved at all.<br/><br/>The accuracy of "Band Of Brothers" is very good as the principal players are still alive to tell about it, and I believe as truthfully as human memory and documentation can allow.  Nevertheless, "Band Of Brothers" has way too much Italian Western introspection' in it, and is, sadly, stretched out for TV.  <br/><br/>After buying both and finding Steven Spielberg's exceptional rendering of his extraordinary glimpse into the reality of WW-2 in "Saving Private Ryan," I was very disappointed in "Band Of Brothers." What is this supposed TO BE, anyway? Some kind of bad sequel from Steven Spielberg? Saving Private Ryan pulled us enough (but that doesn't mean it was not a GREAT movie-it was a GREAT movie) but this? Okay, more and more people are probably going to hate me for hating this crap. It's basically the same kind as Spielberg calls it, "his war series" which makes no sense because this really isn't much of a series, just a movie that goes on FOREVER AND EVER. Steven, really? You can torture us by doing many things such as: 1) Adding computer graphics to all your old films 2) Not being a good editor for the crappy writers of your new films 3) producing 'Jurassic Park III' and 4) making (or helping) this load of crap. It's too overrated and violence doesn't bother me (In fact, it's the opposite) but this...war? I hate war enough. Many people have a reason to go crazy about this mini but really don't waste your time and money because it's almost as unnecessary as adding computer graphics to good films that you made in the past, Steven I understand this series is technically flawless, the history, the cinematography, the accuracy, the realism, it really is amazing what they achieved with this, but even with all of that, I can't find myself to finish the series, I just get bored. <br/><br/>I like how they don't glorify "America" as other war movies, they also did terrible things in war, inhuman things, though they still do over-glorify war as a whole a little bit. yes the fallen heroes, lots of sad stories that actually happened, lots of pain and whatever it's all good and true and I respect everyone that participated as soldiers in the war, the ones that didn't commit any inhuman acts, but I still fail to be entertained by the story as a story.<br/><br/>If you take away the true facts, stick to story alone, though well structured and sometimes meaningful, it is not that entertaining.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong I still think is one of the best series out there, but certainly not the best, not even close, best historically accurate series perhaps, best documentary even, but series, no. I watched the three first episodes and couldn't find any merits to this show other than hyperexpensive, top class production. Limitless means at the service of the most mind numbing narrative vacumm. There's nothing here in the way of character development, thought-provoking situations, mental processes... There's nothing but shootings, shootings and more shootings. Maybe things take another direction from chapter four onwards, but I couldn't stand the shoot-shoot-shoot any longer, and, honestly, I had absolutely no faith that the people responsible for four hours of shootings was even remotely likely to deliver something worth my time in the next 7 chapters to come. The 9,5 rating is the most unbelivable I've seen in film reviews ever. If Americans knew what their spoils of war cost Russians that won the war while taking 80% of the offense from Nazis this would never be a top seller. Keep in mind that what ever Americans lost after going the war due to the fact that Germany cancelled the contract of buying weapons Americans dedicated no more then 10% or less of manpower and supplies to join the war. All so that the spoils can be realized by the US. Real nations that should be celebrated are 1. Russians, 2. British. 3rd French. 4th Jewish and this is all. Episod 9 and 10 just shows pillaging while the real war was about survival. I thought better of the Tom Hanks. Lastly the war with Japan was a complete disgrace of humanity. But the men of war are true heroes. The movie showed one small but very important message: People at war, no matter of their origin, are brothers and heroes and I thank you for that same as I thank my grandfather from Ural and every man that fought the war living through every day for the moment they come back home at peace. My salute to all of you Just finished with this mini series and every time watching any episode, I had this feeling of going through 'Saving Private Ryan' over and over again. Yes, its just feels like an overstretched version of that movie, no wonder its produced by Tom Hanks himself. Don't get me wrong, I am not questioning patriotism or the heroic deeds of American soldiers in WWII. Of course without their contribution, WWII couldn't have been won by allies, but I am just trying to balance the scales here, because I think most of American viewers have given it 10/10 just to honor their heroes, which I truly admire, but while reviewing TV series/movie , one need to focus on different elements of storytelling and not review the original history itself. Hence this following review, without any further ado.<br/><br/>1. Acting - 10/10.<br/><br/>Acting of lead actors is throughout excellent, even the ones who come in for cameo, they maintain the tempo.<br/><br/>2. Screenplay - 5/10<br/><br/>I guess even after watching 10 episodes, if you can't remember the names of lead characters and can't tell who's who, there is definitely some problem with the script. Since every episode centers on one specific WWII mission, there is no main character/hero to root for. Anyways, as directors have taken few cinematic liberties, I think they would have taken another one too, to give some more time for character development. ( may be by increasing the number of episodes)<br/><br/>3. Direction - 5/10<br/><br/>Since there are only 10 episodes to cramp all those WWII missions, it definitely has worsening effect on direction as well. most of the times, viewer is lost as what exactly is going on the screen. Also, viewer need to be aware of at least little bit history of WWII.<br/><br/>4. Dialogues - 9/10<br/><br/>Dialogues are quite good and contemporary to those times. Nothing melodramatic as well.<br/><br/>5. Sound - 7/10<br/><br/>Opening Credit sequence soundtrack is quite memorable one, but apart from that, you can only hear the sound of bullets and shells flying everywhere. Hardly any background music , but I guess that works in favor of this series.<br/><br/>Overall verdict - 7/10. definitely watchable but not great. Besides some cartoons I used to watch when I was a little kid, I never actually watched any other TV shows. I've been trying to find a great one to watch for a while because I've never reviewed one before. After looking at IMDb's recently made Top 250 TV, I decided to watch this one because it wasn't that long (it only has 10 episodes) and it was number 1. I'm glad that I did watch it because it was pretty good and I had a great experience with it.<br/><br/>This is the story of Easy Company of the U.S. Army 101st Airborne division. This mini-series talks about their experiences in WW2. From D-Day to Carentan to Holland to the Ardennes Forest to Hagenau, this film is a complete retelling of when they started and left WW2 and all the exciting events which happened to them while they were in the war.<br/><br/>When I first started to watch this, I was a little worried that it would lose some of its imagination for being based on a true story, but this actually made it more realistic. Instead of them easily mowing down all enemies in their way with little to no effort, it makes the battles go on longer by making it harder to hit the enemies clearly. If they're being shot at, it's harder for them to aim properly so they sometimes have to take a blind shot or peek out and shoot quickly. I like how the film has this because this is how war really is.<br/><br/>On top of that, the movie shows how quick and easy you could be killed off. If a character peeks out of his hiding spot for a quick second or moves the wrong way, it could be a matter of life and death - even if he just peeks out for a split second. Also, the soldiers could be hiding out at their base when suddenly, they could get bombed from enemies above and would have to run to cover. These 2 things not only made the show seem realistic, but pretty claustrophobic in some of its scenes. In fact, I make the argument that some of the fighting sequences are almost as good as the intro to SPR was.<br/><br/>Another thing I really liked about the show was the brief documentary aspect to the episodes. In every episode, it shows about 1-2 minutes of interviews with the people who actually fought in Easy Company. This is a creative and effective way to start off each of its episodes because the lines they say are absorbing and sometimes, they clarify what the episode will be about and they say what's going to go on in it for you to understand it better. It's exposition which never feels too excessive. This show is basically a dramatized retelling of real life events with some documentary elements thrown in to it.<br/><br/>Also, each main actor performs his role expertly. Some actors mature throughout the film and get use to the war and others experience the horrors of losing fellow soldiers and feel consistently uneasy throughout the film. Not a single actor made me cringe in any way. Also, some of the actors such as Scott Grimes, Damian Lewis, and Ron Livingston give performances so good that some of the scenes with them in it will make you feel like they actually were fighting in WW2 as those scenes were filmed.<br/><br/>Like many other great movies and TV shows, however, it's not without flaws. Some episodes take a while to pick up. For example, in episode 8, it takes half the episodes running time for them to start the mission that the episode was about. While it's nice to see buildup and occasional side plots, they often go on too long and serve to slow certain episodes down. A few episodes have this problem. Of course, not all of them take a while to pick up, but some do. Also, some of its fighting scenes have that annoying shaky-cam which I and many others hate because it's very confusing and disorienting. I really wish that directors would stop using it. Granted, however, these are both minor flaws which don't effect my enjoyment that much.<br/><br/>However, my only major flaw with it is that it's style over substance. Of course, that's not to say that it doesn't provide any depth whatsoever. The interviews we see with the soldiers are touching as they let us know about their experience in the war and their own personal thoughts of what they experienced. However, I would've preferred it for the movie to develop the characters while they were in the battles. I felt that character development was handled in a way which I couldn't relate to that much. Also, since the movie didn't say which actors played the men who were interviewed up until the ending of the final episode, I couldn't tell which ones they were throughout the series and most of them seemed like empty shells who I couldn't feel any sympathy for when they died.<br/><br/>However, despite a lack of character development and 2 other minor issues I had, this was a very pleasant first experience with watching a TV show from beginning to end. I can see why so many people enjoy it. The battle scenes, the documentary aspect, and the acting are all reasons why this is so good. There is room for improvement, but it is still very good and I might check out some more TV shows in the future. I watched Band of Brothers and enjoyed it. Very realistic, humbling and enjoyable but why do the Americans have to always portray the British in such a bad light. In the Market Garden episode we have the American soldiers spot a german tank, inform a British tank commander who then proceeds to totally ignore what he has been told and carry on regardless.<br/><br/>
Him ignoring the advice didn't serve the plot, the germans could have ambushed everyone without this and it's a real shame that for no other reason than pure malice a realistic programme has to resort to cheap shots at us. I'm sure in reality the tank commander would have heeded the advice, why wouldn't he? Would he assume that in the middle of the battlefield the american soldiers would be lying !<br/><br/>Yes we know that we couldn't have won the war without your help and we, along with the rest of the world will always be grateful but do you really have to always show us as incompetent, arrogant, self righteuos idiots who just seem to get in the way and annoy you at every turn.<br/><br/>
For me it really damaged the integrity of the show. I watched it well knowing it was about Americans and thus didn't expect a British slant but just like Saving Private Ryan if it did mention Britain it was only to put it down. Nice to know that we could count on you as allies. Hold your horses - this isn't going to be one of those "Am I the only one who..." deals, because "Band of Brothers" is in no way a waste of time and money; I've always had time for Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks (even though the first time they teamed up on behalf of John Patrick Shanley, the result was "Joe Versus The Volcano" - fortunately they made up for it with "Saving Private Ryan"), and both they and everyone else involved can look with pride to this chronicle of Easy Company's travails in World War II. With top acting throughout, an overall unwillingness to really wave the Stars and Stripes, and a superb score by Michael Kamen with writing and directing to match (though unlike Hanks, Spielberg didn't actually direct any episodes), it's almost impossible to fault... but almost never won the Pulitzer.<br/><br/>"Band of Brothers" only has one problem, but it's a big one - it's pretty hard to tell its huge cast of characters apart without a scorecard, and without connecting to the characters there's no connecting to the programme. (Most of them are played by unknowns, which is good in many respects - but maybe it might have helped if there had been a few more recognisable faces alongside David Schwimmer, Colin Hanks (Max from "Roswell") and Donnie Wahlberg, ex-New Kid On The Block and latter day brother of Mark.) Samuel Fuller's "The Big Red One" also followed a group of soldiers through wartime, but we were only focusing on four (plus their leader), which may have made the difference. I certainly managed to get into that far more than this.<br/><br/>You won't hear any complaints from me if this does well at the Emmys in the autumn, but as far as HBO miniseries executive produced by Tom Hanks go, I'll have to give the edge to "From the Earth to the Moon."<br/><br/>P.S. As aired on BBC2, each episode carries the credit "HBO and BBC present," but it's BBC-devoid on HBO. And the Americans saw it first. Hmmmm.... It biggest problem with this show is that is shows american war criminals as a good guys! Also matter of collaboration with stalin and american betreyal of Poland is totally ignore. American war crimes are hidden and show only tries to show german crimes. We, viewers need to be aware american were even worse in WW2 than germans! This is a war film that tells what happened to these men very well, but it doesn't really show us a complete vision of any one of it's characters. Maybe it's because of the source material, but I never felt like I was ever inside any of these characters minds, reacting to the brutality and madness with them.  I feel like the most insight we get into how it actually felt to be out there is from the interviews at the start of each episode.  Do these characters even think about what they are killing and dying for?  When Winter goes to Paris he gets flashbacks of killing that soldier in the ambush.  What comes of it? It makes it seem like war is some kind of macho football game type of thing, where a lot of people die, and we should be sad, but why....This could have benefitted from using internal dialogue with it's characters,  then I might care more when one gets his leg blown off. For more insight into what it feels like to be there see Malick's "Thin Red Line" I don't get why this has a 9.5 rating...too much overratedness...I get that it's a war series and everybody like this kind of patriotism shown in any movie or series...personally I don't get this type of content...anyway, the only thing I found interesting from this show is that it has given us many great actors to watch...for me this shows it's just meh... Although many reviewers have said that "Band of Brothers" is very realistic, and I would grant that that is something it certainly is, ultimately I found it unsatisfying to watch because of very bad cinematography. Because of the dull, drab, lifeless colour I could hardly distinguish the difference between German or Allied soldiers in most of the battle scenes. I don't understand what it is about today's filmmakers that makes them think they have to use flat, boring low saturation colour. Give me the rich, vivid, dripping Color by De Luxe of movies like Patton, Von Ryan's Express, Tora! Tora! Tora! any day over the pastel hues of BOB. If you watch any of these three movies you'll be able to clearly pick out who's the enemy and who's on our side.<br/><br/>On a related note, this might be why the newer Star Trek series never did catch the imagination of the public. Again, dull, drab, lifeless colour with low-contrast lighting. Compare it against the original Star Trek series and you'll see the difference that good colour and high contrast lighting makes. The show set out what it meant to do I believe which is show what one particular actual company had to endure during WW2. It showed all the things they went through. The waiting times, the bad officers, the grunts perspective as well as good men rising through the ranks. What I thought it best illustrated is how pointless and miserable it was to be a grunt. You just do whatever you are told and try not to die even when half the time your mission is completely pointless. The one area that didn't land to me was the attachment to the characters. I really only ever liked the two men who worked together at the end after the war, the red head officer and the dude who was in office space. Other than that the characters were too in and out due to injury, death, or just non-focus on the character to truly make me care for them. I cared for them because it was a true story but not because what was on the screen. The last few episodes had emotional moments that did land when they liberated a concentration camp and when the actual men talked about the men who passed in the war and didn't get to have after war lives. They told what some of the men did or were doing after the war and just trying to get through life and then some of them talked about their friends they lost. Seeing some of these men break down or get close legitimately made me cry and feel bad for not loving the show. I almost just wanted to watch a documentary of them telling their stories telling the good, the bad, and the ugly of the war rather than watch this show but I'm sure that would be way too hard for them. True heroes. This HBO mini series is no wonder the highest rated one in TV drama history. Everything looked so real, so realistic, so vividly portrayed those young men of the Easy Compnay. I still remembered that when they were parachuted into the war zone in Normandy, they lost 64 soldiers right away, that's an over 50% casualty ratio.<br/><br/>The WWII was beyond the imagination of the people who had went through the WWI, the weaponry was more advanced, more sophisticated, and more powerful to kill more soldiers. I just don't know why those political leaders would still like to declare wars to kill their own people and the people during the war being called their enemies.<br/><br/>One of the dialog that in-printed my memory and still so clearly remember today by me is: "You salute the rank, not the man". It was a great sentence that could be used universally almost in every kind of human relationship. "You salute the wealth, not the man"; no wonder rich people are so respectful to the people who are less rich.<br/><br/>The only character I really don't like is the 'Lewis Nixon" character played by Ron Livingston. It seems that this Lewis Nixon was related to some rich and powerful family, 'cause I've never seen him doing anything either in training and in combat. He was just a guy in the waltzed through the Army, in training camp or in the war zone, all the other soldiers were dying around him, yet he seemed to care less but himself, just kept drinking and slept late. I don't know if this drama series was based on true memories from those WWII veterans or not, but this Lewis Nixon character was such disgusting and totally unnecessary role in this series, unless he was actually a real character that nobody respected and put him in this drama series was on purpose to expose him as a white-glove guy who waltzed through that war like taking a walk in the park, by doing nothing but lip service and drinking, never wounded, never faced the enemy in combat, never soiled his uniformed. But I do believe there are so many guys just like him in every country's military system, doing nothing but being promoted constantly and, you still have to salute him, even nobody really respect him, but you have to salute his higher rank. I just watched it, because my friend tell me to. And for God sake, this is one of the best 700 minutes I ever spent to watching a series. This is... I don't know how to say it... This is pretty, fantastic, yet scary, and took you so deep into it. You thinking of it every time before you sleep, and again you thinking about it when you awake, this is a damn great series! Seriously! You'll be very thankful for a warm blanket, a clean water, a quite moment, a peaceful moment, a food, a home, a family. It's a series that everybody NEED to watch, everybody should see this. Spoiler: this series may change your life. At least, your point of view of -what-we-called-a-solution-to-make-peace- war. One last advance, see this. Don't ask why, just see. Take my advance as a gift. This was good because it showed what the army had to go through. It showed how the airborne had to jump out of the planes. A lot of them did not end up where they were supposed to land so a lot of them were in mixed up groups. They had lost most of the officers when they landed so people had to step up and be the commanding officers. Some bad things were when they were in the trenches a lot of people got injured and they could not get evacuated. Most of the hospitals were overflowing with people. If you like movies with a lot of action then you would like this movie. If you like accurate movies then this is for you. This powerful and unforgettable miniseries presented by Academy Award winning director Steven Spielberg and highly celebrated character actor Tom Hanks, is undoubtedly the most celebrated and highly commemorative TV series that tells the remarkable story of a platoon of American paratroopers who travel through Normandy to battle against the Nazis, it is an astounding account of determination and sacrifice, and it is most probably the most realistic contribution to the historical events of WW2, since Saving Private Ryan, the power and danger anticipates the viewer by each passing scene, and the heart throbbing sequences that you watch are disturbing and endlessly watchable. Out of all the war films that have been successfully made, Band of Brothers endures a headlong recreation of dehumanisation and courage. This movie is the most interesting movie I have ever seen.<br/><br/>I have watched Band Of Brothers a good 20 times. <br/><br/>It never gets old. 13 hours of fun for the viewer. <br/><br/>It tells the truth of what was lost and what are grandparents lost. I true film for history.<br/><br/>This movie shows that the lost of young men will not be forgotten and there fight will always be unpayable.<br/><br/>Thanks to all our hero's. <br/><br/>and to There Familys<br/><br/>David Of Rhode Island The Mini series was great. Now I'm a big World war Two buff, And If you've seen Saving private Ryan you wonder if It's a true story, Well It is and it isn't. The Information. The Private in the 101st had three brothers. But They were all not killed in the beach landing. And The wrong thing is the name of the Private. The SPR name was James Francis Ryan. The real name of the soldier was Fritz Niland.(Not sure if I spelled it write) Well His first brother was part of the 82d. His second brother was part of the 29th infantry. And his third brother was flying (or in a PIR) and was killed when his plane was shot down. This information can be found in the book Band of Brothers by Stephen E. Ambrose. He was sent home without needing to be searched out. But I loved Saving Private Ryan either way. It was entertaining. Well Please don't get angry.. Because I'm just letting everyone know who wanted to know why Saving Private Ryan was not listed as a true story.. Even if it was It wasn't fully true. Geat show shame i missed it on TV and have only just got round to seeing it now, true been English its still a shame to see how we get shown in American flag waving films or shows(cowards/stuck up) or films that Americans wish to change history just a little U-571 anyone ha ha, but this they do, and if the English felt the need to make a war film such as pearl harbour about attacks on home soil it would have to be London..parts 1 to god knows as we where hit so many times, but hell i just have miss givings of how we are shown and its a shame because both sides did so much good to stop the Germans, shame it can not be shown that way, but as for the show well 1st class just has to be seen and for those of us who play on PCs and the game Call of duty uo its great to see Foy(those who play the game will know what i mean)another thing that is strange is anyone in UK watching it will see almost half the cast is British and it can be very strange seeing these guys been yanks although they carry the parts off very well, i am happy i bought the box set and i will be watching them for many years to come though be nice if there was another show to come in time like this one. A couple of reactions to this important presentation <br/><br/>1) This is not a "movie" - I loved it, but not as entertainment - I received deeper meaning from it.<br/><br/>2) I can never watch any other WWII movie without being disappointed because of the greatness of this series.<br/><br/>3) A natural sequel would be for HBO (or someone) to do a similar treatment for the soldiers in the Pacific theater where the skirmishes were just as bloddy and focused on a smaller geograhic area.<br/><br/>4) Instead of trashing Columbus's arrival in the New World as genocide, this is what should be shown to all high-school age kids in American history class. <br/><br/>5) If there was ever a moral justification for war is our brief history, the concentration camp episode certainly offered compelling evidence. Overhyped and overrated, extremely disappointed in this miniseries. I was told this was comparable to Saving Private Ryan, which its not.<br/><br/>I recommend Sword of Honour instead. I am baffled by the praised this mini-series has received. There was a war alright, a war over how many cliches they could possibly fit into a war series. The acting for the most part wasn't very good. It might have been ok if everyone involved weren't so self-conscious, which was the biggest problem in the series. The dialogue the actors spoke was pretty much laughably bad. A lot of the special effect weren't that impressive, especially in the first couple of episodes. The scripts were so weak. Even in the best episode with the temporarily blind soldier you knew how that would end up. That episode had some really good acting, but it was sabotaged by the lousy script. "Band of Brothers" didn't give me any insight what so ever. Due the fact that this was on HBO there of course was some nudity which I found tasteless and out of place. If you want to see some movie with war go watch Saving Private Ryan or The Thin Red Line, which combine impressive visuals, good acting, and impressive scripts. A lot of people wondered why this did so poorly in the ratings. It was the bad acting and the predictable scripts. Some people said it was a lack of big name stars, but that didn't hurt SPR. I am surprised that Tom Hanks and Steven Speilberg was involved in this mess. I am sure it will win a ton of Emmy's due to the heavy subject matter, and a distinctive visual style, but overall it was a total artistic failure. I'm basing these comments on the first episode alone, but......<br/><br/>I'm surprised that there has been little discussion about the wider context in which Easy Company's operations took place. There were, after all, five main divisions involved in the D-Day landings, 2 American, 2 British and 1 Canadian.<br/><br/>I'm still very uncomfortable with war-movies that effectively mislead viewers into thinking that a campaign or battle depended only on one set of participants.<br/><br/>It's particularly galling that the only time British characters appear it is to reinforce stereotypes: the doddering old fool on a cycle, the cheeky-chappie cockney.<br/><br/>What does it say about Spielberg and Hanks that they failed to take on board any of the criticism of the way Saving Private Ryan depicted the war in France as though it were solely a US operation? It's especially odd given that, otherwise, the production team don't go overboard in romanticising the operation. Some scenes clearly acknowledged the capacity for cruelty and expedient barbarism on even the Allied side.<br/><br/>In a technical sense the series is excellent and I can't fault the performances. Indeed, I found myself enjoying large parts of the first episode: it's just a shame that certain aspects leave a bitter taste in the mouth. This is a great, unique series and I watched every episode at least three times and it's fascinating because it can be far more realistic than any WWII series or even movies produced during the fifties, sixties and seventies However, for fairness you have to ask: are there any problems? The answer is yes.<br/><br/>One problem is that this is very much history from the point of view of a rather ambitious and competitive Dick Winters. Most of his rivals aren't portrayed in a very good light, if you think about it. Captain Lewis Nixon seems to have nothing better to do than to scour liberated Europe for VAT 69 whiskey. In one scene when questioned why he only drinks VAT 69, he even replies with a cliched "nothing but the best for mrs. Nixon's baby boy". It doesn't sound very natural, and sounds more like something Winters himself might have remembered or thought. Of course, the real whipping boy is captain Sobel (David Schwimmer), the company's Jewish C.O., who Winters replaces and eventually outranks. Now this may all be true, but nevertheless... Another problem is the fact that the pervasive racism of the US army in the forties isn't treated any more than through highlights. The Louisiana medic's remark about the presence of a Black Congolese nurse seems forced and less than frank, and there is only one Black character in a briefly glimpsed Red Ball Express truckdriver. The rest of the racial/ethnic static is chiefly expressed through sergeant "Gonorrhea" Guarnere (fistfight with one Jewish trooper, some static when encountering a Hispanic replacement), which seems a little easy. Flowing along that vein is the issue of lack of representation of other units, mainly of course following from the fact that this series point of view is only and totally limited to that of Company E ("Easy"), 506th PIR, 101st Airborne. Even the 82nd Airborne doesn't get much of a mention, while the people who were really in the thick of it during operation Market Garden, the British Paras (of 10,000 troops, they had 8,000 casualties - KIA, WIA, POW, MIA) are only there to be resqued by Easy Company. Hmmm... Then, there are the macho statements at the end of some of the episodes. For instance, "After the Battle of Bastogne, the general consensus was that 506th didn't need to be resqued by Patton.". Gee, I guess they would have continued taking on those German panzer units with just their bajonets, huh?<br/><br/>In conclusion, this is still a very good war story, one that will stand the test of time. It is number one in realism and attention to detail. However, if you're looking for a more compact viewing experience, check out "When Trumpets Fade" instead. Just my opinion for now... Sure, I saw them all. But if u would be honest, it could all be compressed to a Saving Private Ryan movie. And that would be great. But the series got some much soap in it and so much single minded all class hero I am an American syndroms wrapped around it that it makes me wanna puke. And I am not even a communist. Or a Nazi. Or a Jew. Or a Terrorist. Whatever. I am just an European kid with some kinda notion about what culture could be. Or what a great movie could be about. And yes I am greatfull that the Americans freed my country (Netherlands). So u cannot catch me on that. But the boredom overwon..<br/><br/>Great Job Steven! What's next? Jurassic Parc 4? As usual, in an American movie, if World War 2 is the subject, there is excessive American propaganda, and in this movie there is excessive American propaganda. America is helpful, America is very good, America is beside the oppressed, America is against the bad guys, America is the super hero of the world, America is the savior of the helpless people, America is the symbol of peace in the world, America is the father of the world, the other states are the children of America. America brings peace and democracy to the places it goes to!<br/><br/>As for the series itself, the series was shot in high quality. Picture effects and sounds are very good. The battle scenes are so good. You feel as if you are in war. The battle scene in the first scene of setting up Er Ryan is more in every episode of this series. So you will get enough of watching a war scene. I felt the Band of Brothers mini series was terrible. I didn't feel it was even the least bit like realistic war. Tom Hanks does a very pathetic job of directing and I think he is a better actor than a director. Saving Private Ryan is a good movie because it has good acting (Tom Hanks) and good directing ( Steven Speilberg). So overall, pretty bad. "Band of Brothers" in a word is awesome. I couldn't wait to see each episode. Co-Executive Produced by Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, it has the realism, look and feel of Spielberg's "Saving Private Ryan" (1998) but with more insight into the characters. Hanks even directed one episode himself."Band of Brothers" in a word is awesome. I couldn't wait to see each episode. Co-Executive Produced by Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, it has the realism, look and feel of Spielberg's "Saving Private Ryan" (1998) but with more insight into the characters. Hanks even directed one episode himself. Incredible movie...couldn't wait to see the next episode. Missed the "guys" when it was over. Absolutely a perfect cast. The "Battle of the Bulge" and the scene where Easy Company is patroling the woods, hunting for fresh meat, and came across the first concentration prisoner camp was very intense and had my husband and I in tears. Where did they find actors to play the prisoners??? Interviews with the actual soldiers during the movie and at the end helped to remind us that this was a true story, not just a Hollywood production. Learned more about WWII - the who, why and when - than I did in school. A great resource for schools. The sacrifice and horrors of war...what the military gives up for our freedoms. This is one of those series that you can watch over and over again. And think its excellent every single time i think I've watched it about 5 or 6 times now and i haven't get tired of it once. If you haven't seen it yet buy the DVD collection box its one of the best buys I've ever done.<br/><br/>The series is awesome it has everything a good mini series should have! The display of characters, the story, the special effects everything its the best everything. I cant think of one thing that isn't great about this series. I just love it!<br/><br/>Rating 10/10 A MUST SEE FOR ALL WWII BUFFS!!<br/><br/>I absolutely love this 10-part mini series. Its quality of production, the acting in the cast and the detail to realism is very impressive.<br/><br/>The entire production of this series was done under the guidance and consultancy of the real men who actually served in "easy" company during WWII, so you know its not one of these hollywood over-glorified war stories with lots of over dramatized BS in there.<br/><br/>I like WWII history, my grand pop served in WWI, WWII AND Korea..and my other grandpop was friends with Bill Garnere (unfortunately I'm bad at spelling last names) -- who for those who haven't seen it yet is was one of the members of easy company, one of the "Band of Brothers".<br/><br/>I heard through the rumor mill another Band of Brothers will be out for the Pacific portion of the war...I hope its true. If anyone like war movies, this is the one. You can look back the history and the pain caused by the WWII. An excellent work by David Frankel and Tom Hanks. Love to see it again and again. A young man or a teenager nowadays might say the life is hard for them. Think how hard it was back then, those kids did not even have a chance to make a decision about their own life. All actors have done a very impressive job on acting. The mini series is well divided into 10 DVDs and a bonus DVD. Sound and video quality is excellent. The theme music can mesmerize you for a while. I almost don't have anything negative to say about this series. If you have a big screen TV or a projector, you can kill a day watching the series. This mini series is a must have. This is a must-see war series. If you want to watch it rent it, buy it, or watch it on HBo if it's on or History channel. Band of Brothers is an amazing mini series of how men come together throughout WWII. Steven Speilberg and Tom Hanks were excellent at directing it as a beautiful timeless masterpiece of what war is like and Stephen E. Ambrose's book was even better. The battles of the film were realistic like Saving Private Ryan. This must of been probably a little long to make. I didn't think this was boring at all either and I just love to watch war movies so I decided to see this and it appeared to be sensational and superb. Lovely mini-series!!<br/><br/>10/10 Powerful and riviting. The non stop action is intense and emotional. The camera work is incredible and it really shows the emotions of the troops. By far the best war drama I have ever seen, and I have seen just about every one. David Schwimmer is hard to take as anything other than goofball Ross from Friends, but his roll as a hard nosed but gutless instructor in jump school really showed what the solders went through just to earn the right to go to war. It was no secret that the survival of paratroopers was slim and these troops are the best. The battle scenes are just incredible. I wish this was shown in a theatre. The special effects are awesome and would be something else on a huge theatre screen, of course you would have to be in the theatre all day long to watch it. Watching in one hour intervals is impossible since it is so addicitive. Buying the DVD is worth every penny.<br/><br/>Mo There are plenty of people who have reviewed this series more thoroughly than I ever could, but I would like to say that this series is by far the best war "movie" I have ever seen. It's really unfair to compare it with other war *movies* because this is a series, and thus lends itself to character development like no other movie ever has. You will laugh and cry right along with the characters, as well as the real-life "heroes" whose commentary opens each segment. I don't see how a movie could ever get more realistic about WWII than this one, although it focuses strictly on the last 1 to 2 years of the European campaign, and basically ignores the Pacific theatre. This is a 10-hour "movie"; one that covered every aspect of WWII from start to finish would probably be about 30 hours long!!<br/><br/>This series is gripping from the beginning as these paratroopers go through rigorous training, all the way to the end of the war and follows up with reunions and updates to the current day (2001) of where the "heroes" are now. Of course, as is said in the series many times, these guys never considered themselves heroes; the real heroes were the guys next to them, or the ones who died in combat doing their jobs. <br/><br/>Watch it. Even if you hate it, you will maybe at least have some idea of the hell these guys went through to rid the world of a great evil. Especially the episode "Why We Fight". It explains it all. I've heard lots of good things about this mini series, but I must admit it did not live up to the hallowed expectations I've had from the hype generated and a Dreamworks production.<br/><br/>If you're looking for gung-ho action Saving Private Ryan style, you will be sorely disappointed, like I was. Nevertheless, stellar character development was what made this series so refreshing, compared to a typical 120 minute war movie.<br/><br/>I rated this 8/10 for first class acting and casting, and for the realism. Not for the action. A great mini that will probably never run on german tv. I can´t remember seeing such strong, almost breathtaking scenes, when it comes to combat. The camera guides right into battle. It´s the type of description of reality of war, I only remember from the book "Stahlgewitter` of german author ernst juenger. Though I like Band of Brothers for a certain sense of reality, I am afraid most us-productions (including this one) are not very realistic when it comes to the germans in ww2 - or as you probably would say - the nazis. This became a fact to me after listening to many american war movies and especially the american version of "the boat", a german war movie. The parts of the german soldiers in their translation were turned into some ridiculous comic-sadist style. I guess americans will never understand that war is evil on all sides - until they will share the terror of an industrialized war in their own country. An experience they never made. So all you american war buffs, you want some real germans at war and not through your glasses of rambo/bush stereotypes? Then watch "Stalingrad (J. Vilsmaier)` or "Cross of Iron (S. Peckinpah)`. Or one of the german movies I commented on. Still I liked BoB for entertainment and the type of realism you also found in the close combat scenes of "saving private james ryan.` It's a nice but the main idea was to show American people are the best and the most smart people Saving Private Ryan was my all time favourite film until Band of Brothers came along (although its not really a film). Band of Brothers explores events that happened to Easy company of the 101st airbourne from the training camp right to the fall of Nazi Germany. The actors chosen for each character is superb as everyone fits their role perfectely (Yes, that includes Ross from friends [David Schiwimmer]). i have never seen any other series as close to being as God like as this one. it makes a brilliant gift and as i have said before, Whoever voted less than 10 in the ratings should apologize immediately !!! and i mean it ;-) This is definetly not the best mini series. I mean Cocaine coast and Unsolved are not even comparable to this waste of time. I only watched this because of the big over rating on IMDB. As I started this I only wanted it to end but I can say it was keeping me entertained at some points. It is probably the most intense show i've watched. Really intense and realisting, but this show is a really big no no. I didn't actually see this series until it reached the tv networks in Norway in the fall of 2003. Although I didn't have high expectations about this production (SPR was a huge letdown) I was pleasantly surprised. If I remember correctly we even catch a glimpse of some Americans executing a p.o.w. (American soldiers doing bad things ? *gasp*) What I mean when I say this is that war is not all white and black like some movies portray it to be, and this movie to some extent took this into account. Still though it irritates me (and many others) that the Germans are always portrayed as being a bunch of headless chickens who seem to run around at random, with little or no coherency whatsoever. (and most of the time with their backs turned to the Americans so they can easily pick them off) I wonder how it took them so long to win the war if that's how the enemy really acted. Anyway, if you're an American watch this movie, you'll love it. If you're not then you'll most likely notice the same things that I do and they will probably irritate you as well. All in all not a bad series, but ultimately numerous historical flaws just wrecks what could have been a great series. (4/10) After watching the final episode of Band of Brothers I get the strange feeling I had seen this before and done better in saving private Ryan,not that band was not great but it had a little sister feel to it. The good things about Band of Brothers are really good,Damian Lewis as Richard D. Winters was easily the best thing in the series,his Tom Hanks awe shucks looks and Gary Cooper determined  demeanor made the movie. Now to the bad things about Band,part 1 "Currahee was not the best start to a mini series I have ever seen,it was very very slow in parts and when David Schwimmer makes his appearance as Capt. Herbert M. Sobel it made me laugh,it made no sense to have Schwimmer trying to play a hard ass,his hard expressions were more funny than mean. the other problem with part one was the beginning of a problem that lasted till until part 5 "Crossroads,the way band was shot in dull tones made all the men look the same and it wasn't until part 5 which was directed by Tom Hanks that the soldiers could be told apart. The other problem with the first 4 episodes of band was the Blair witch type camera shots that made me dizzy. Back to the good points of band,starting with part 5 "Crossroads the writing seemed to get better and the characters were starting to get fleshed out,the story was now building to a climax that would end with the soldiers finding a concentration camp near the end of the war,this episode is the best and most heart wrenching especially since the last episode points was an anti climax. Band of brothers is not the best mini series ever made but it is one of the top ten  of all time. 8 out of 10 It dosen't worth the time you take to watch it , i dont know why it is 9.5 rated Didn't finish the third episode. super boring and normal. the action scenes were pretty awesome. but there weren't really storylines or characters i cared about (1 viewing) I picked this TV series only for its poster and its catchy title. Then I was amazed to see Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg serving as executive producer for the show because saving private Ryan is one of my favorite movie. I watched the whole series in one sitting spellbound and amazed. WWII has always interested me as a history student and I never miss a chance to watch any movie or TV series centered on WWII. After watching band of brothers bravery of easy company made me cry. Especially the seventh episode ' the breaking point' focusing on Carwood Lipton's importance. Donnie Wahlberg nailed the character, in my opinion playing Lipton's character is Donnie best work till date. Not only Donnie but every actor who played a role in this show was awesome.
If you call yourself a movie geek but haven't seen this one, I suggest you do it now.
A master piece indeed. From producers Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks (also directing an episode), this ten-part (an hour an episode) mini-series, based on the book by Stephen Ambrose, looked like the same quality as Saving Private Ryan. It basically tells the story of the "E" Easy Company, 506th Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division as they go through World War II. Throughout the series they parachute behind enemy lines, fight through rain and snow, in towns and trenches, shelter from bombs and bullets, and suffer many losses and failures, but all make it through to the end of the war. Starring Scott Grimes as TSgt. Donald Malarkey, Golden Globe nominated Damian Lewis as Maj. Richard D. Winters, Golden Globe nominated Ron Livingston as Capt. Lewis Nixon, Shane Taylor as Cpl. Eugene Roe, Saw II's Donnie Wahlberg as C. Carwood Lipton, The Beach's Peter Youngblood Hills as SSgt. Darrel 'Shifty' Powers, Touching the Void's Nicholas Aaron as Pvt. Robert 'Popeye' Wynn, Ned Kelly's Philip Barantini as Sgt. Wayne 'Skinny' Sisk, Michael Cudlitz as Sgt. Denver 'Bull' Randleman, Rick Gomez as Sgt. George Luz; Lock, Stock and Two Barrels' Dexter Fletcher as SSgt. John Martin, Star Trek: First Contact's Neal McDonough as 1st Lt. Lynn 'Buck' Compton, Dale Dye as Col. Robert Sink, Friends' David Schwimmer as Herbert M. Sobel, Simon Pegg as 1st Sgt. William Evans and Tom Hanks as British officer.

It was number 50 on The 50 Greatest TV Dramas. Very good! Well, I was hoping for much more from Spielberg, well - not from Hanks! Tom is anyway just an actor, OK main role in Private Ryan, but he should act. They rushed to show all the aspects of war, RUSHED, not paying attention to what makes the atmosphere, like Spielberg did in Saving Private Ryan. It is far too week representation of relationships between soldiers, it's fake! You get seconds of good scenes in every episode, but it's just not enough. Simply, it is good for less demanding audience, or for someone blinded by the budget they've spent on filming it. Sceenes are rushed, frames not connected, it's like camera and director did't have good connection. Acting is very good, indeed! But, as I said, atmosphere, directing... that's lacking. Not recommended, except for killing time. Maybe that's because I'm watching this in 2019, but I don't understand why this is so highly rated. It's OK, but not more than that Terrible film making!  Reminded me of "The Blair Witch Project."  What a STUPID idea to use a hand-held camera and PURPOSELY bounce it around so the viewer 1)cannot tell what is happening on screen, or 2) gets a headache or becomes nauseous.  I got the distinct impression the director DID NOT want anyone to see what was happening on screen!  Why didn't he just blank out the screen for three minutes at a time?  The intent is supposed to be to make the viewer ENJOY watching the film.  <br/><br/>BoB was made to be an amusement park attraction, not a television movie. This could have been a powerful film if made correctly.  I think it's a disservice to the survivors of E Company. I really tried too! I have to announce then, that Band of Brothers is one of the most over-hyped productions of all time.<br/><br/>When the series first came out, the nerd from Friends almost turned me off of it... instead, the fact that it was boring did.
Fast forward 10 years and I still found the pilot dull, the next episode like a watered down PG rated war flick and then the 3rd episode seemed to lose all focus whatsoever.
In the 4th episode, our merry band of Yanks jump into occupied Holland for Operation: Golden Market, but don't expect A Bridge Too Far! The Yanks, losing a mere 4 men, were clearly away from the core of the fighting and they live to fight another unexciting battle in the next episode... not that I'll give this tedious programme another minute!<br/><br/>The problems with BoB were that the characters are bland - and, yes, I know it's a war programme, concentrating the majority of its one hour length per episode on the combat - but I never really cared who lived, died, said what, did what, etc. The "action" - as mentioned above - felt too sterile too.
Given those two aspects, there's not really much to recommend.<br/><br/>I would have given the programme 3/10 but the real aeroplanes in fly-by and the authenticity of the scenes really bumped up the production value, deserving that extra mark for effort. However it's a nice series, but I think it's overrated. For a 9.5 rating I was waiting to see a WOW, but it's not. I´ve watched the series 19 years after production. And maybe thats the reason why I feel a littel disappointed about the look and feel of it. In comparison with James Ryan or Fury, the series looks bald and a little too much dressed up. The story and characters are too clean, the emotions too flat. The best part is the opening of every episode, with quotes of real world war veterans.<br/><br/>Nevertheless its a little milestone for the war genre and the series has an emotional and unconvinient story plot. Its straight narrated but with no clear focus on one character. I am not sure why so many people praise this tv series. We know it is decent, however it's not amazing and for sure 9.5 is way to much. Typical American super hero movie. Long story short. War began in 1939, suddenly in 1944 US soldiers came to Europe, they charged through several countries winning WW2.
90% of German soldiers miss their shots, the US soldiers (who were fighting for less then a year) seem to be veterans when their talk to their new friends. None of the allied countries seemed to fight- said again, US came and solo won the WW2. TO be fair this movie should be put somewhere between Saving private Ryan and Avengers. Great but far too short. Only 4 episodes had fighting in them, the rest was training or just the end of the war . A very realistic portrayal of the lives of average paratroopers fighting for the freedom of allies. This alone makes all Americans fighting against the nazis heroes.<br/><br/>The interwoven stories of Easy Company makes binge watching a breeze as each episode pulls you in closer to their immediate experiences of life and death. I think this is the best thing ever created for a screen. I absolutely love the show.<br/><br/>Also before I get into the grit of it all I just want to say that it contains some of the best photography of any thing I've ever seen. (SPOILERS) the battle of the bulge segment with the white snow and exploding trees from artillery is beautiful. <br/><br/>I've read some of the 'bad' reviews from other users and thought that some things could use clearing up (in case they put you off the series). One review I read criticised the use of bland/ dull colouring and said that they expected clear sharp colouring. Not to say that the imaging is bad or any thing but the colour isn't as sharp as other modern films but I prefer this as it makes you feel as if you are right there in the 1940s. I've also read complaints about lack of character progression and a lack of a specific plot/ plot development. The thing one has to remember is that the 'character' of the series is Easy Company from 101st Airborne. Yes some characters are developed more than others but then again some die and some join half way through so I think that there definitely isn't a lack of character development. Also the lack of plot development is just stupid because the point of a mini series versus a single film is that a larger plot can be created and here the plot is the events of WW2. Its not some silly gun blazing action packed shot-em up that follows some cliché plot like stolen nuclear missiles; instead its a beautifully made gem of a mini series that truly portrays WW2. Sublime!! Hopeful but not sappy, historically accurate but not dull, realistic but not propagandist, emotional but not melodramatic..Brilliantly directed, acted, and written.<br/><br/>War adaptations generally try either to reproach its subject matter by showing an excess of human suffering or try to rationalize it by trying to paint a black and white, good and evil world with heroism and villainy. This is where Band of Brothers is the strongest--it never feels as if there is some subtext to the actions and dialogue, it doesn't try to glorify or denounce, what it does feel like is genuine; events, people; their decisions; the consequences of those decisions, circumstances, the bonds that are formed... <br/><br/>It is engaging, moving, and arguably the best 10 or so hours you can spend in front of a screen! I'm not always the biggest fan of war films. Not that I dislike them, I just can never get all that emotionally invested in them. My favorite is The Thin Red Line, and it's not exactly like other war films. This definitely benefits from having a very extended running time, and it really does help to have this extra time with the soldiers. Their development is pretty magnificent, and individual chapters' focus on different character is mostly well drawn-out. The performance are fantastic as well, with Damien Lewis really providing the heart of it. The ending is pretty heart-breaking and immensely emotional, no matter how much you're into it. best mini series i've ever watched... completes frame in one movie, such as: sadness, laughter, friendship, personality, leadership, etc.. comprehensive! it also gives me more knowledge on the war history it self and also other knowledge in life. the director really doing his job with the research about this movie. smart actors is also one of the key of becoming this movie a box office... a "based-on-true-story" movies always inspired me... although on some parts the detail are not presented clearly, the makers of this series is trying hard to make the audience didn't miss a single context of each episodes. hopes we'll see another brilliant mini series just like this one. I have always been a WWII buff and will often seek out books, documentaries, and films that have been made about that time in history. So when I found out that HBO was making a mini-series based on the men who served in the 101st Airborne Division it would be accurate to describe my feeling as giddy. It was as if they had done it just for my birthday. When the first episode aired I admit I was feeling some trepidation over the realization that there was a chance it might not be any good. Thankfully that was not to be the case. Band of Brothers is the trifecta of excellence: writing, acting, and directing.<br/><br/>It was impossible not to get lost in lives of these men, even if only for a brief moment in time. When Easy Company lost a man I too felt like I had lost someone close to me. What made it even more poignant is without knowing who each of the older gentlemen talking in the beginning of the episode were you knew that there were real men missing from their ranks. You knew that what you were about to see happened to real people. Some men you stayed with all the way until the end and some were gone in the blink of an eye.<br/><br/>Band of Brothers pulls no punches and while it does not have the same blood and guts of some more showy WWII films it doesn't need to have them. What they do show is more powerful than any amount of blood could ever be. Band of Brothers is a must see for anyone who appreciates quality. I watched this series more than 10 years ago, and ever since I have watched it several times. I still learn a lot of new things every time. The depth of the characters and the attention to details are very well represented by the directors. <br/><br/>There are also a lot of lessons to be learned on aspects of leadership, team work and bonding! The episodes "day of days (#2)", "the last patrol (#8)" and "why we fight (#9)" are noteworthy in these aspects. <br/><br/>I am a big fan of WW2 based history/novels/movies/TV series, and this one is on the top of my list.<br/><br/>Overall, beautiful storytelling, nice direction, very good acting for a mini series.<br/><br/>I haven't found a flaw, and even if there is any, it is worth ignoring. My rating would be 10/10 Truly one of the most amazing stories told about the war. That serves as a living testament to what we owe the men that fought for us. <br/><br/>This show is fantastically well done, accurately representing the settings, struggles, and victories that many men were a part of. Men that were a part of the greatest generation to walk this earth. If these men and countless others had not done what this show does so well to represent we would all be speaking German right now.<br/><br/>The show itself is just spectacular even if it is very difficult to watch. Leaving out none of the "Gory" details in the process of telling such a fantastic and horrific part of what happened during the war. You watch this show often cringing from the brutal reality of it, wondering if you really want to be watching it until the credits roll after the last episode. A sense of amazement washes over you as you realize what you just watched. The show leaves you with a new found respect for the period, the war, and the men that did serve and do serve for us today. 10/10 A virtually unknown cast but a amazing director in the form of Steven Spielberg.Even so the cast prove themselves to be true actors and the direction is as usual brilliant.<br/><br/>The fight scenes are truly epic but in the midst of the explosions and gore is a very serious message about some of the bravest men. You truly feel the bond between the solders and get very emotionally attached to the characters over the 13 hours of film.....<br/><br/>i recommend this to anyone even if you don't normally like war movies you have to watch this.<br/><br/>Truly Epic.<br/><br/>A MUST SEE!!!!!!! It seem a pity to confine this to "best television production".....It is arguably the best production that I have ever had the privilege to view. Every time I watch it, it just gets better.....you LIVE the experiences through the fantastic portrayals. The actual men......truly heroes. My father was in the Pacific theater and never opened up about his experiences; I can only imagine how horrible it was. Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks created a vivid representation of the horrors that these men experienced in Europe. To this day, I still cannot watch "Why We Fight" without crying.<br/><br/>Only one other television production of this quality comes to mind, and that is "Lonesome Dove". Television does not have to be a wasteland! Harder to watch than the D-Day sequence of "Saving Private Ryan," because before the shooting starts, we, the viewers, have spent some time getting to know these men as individuals. And the longer film time (10 hours) allows us to stay with a man for a few more seconds after his legs have been blown off. We have the time to take in the horror and the agony.<br/><br/>I have never served in the military, but this seems like the real deal. These 10 hours should be mandatory viewing for every 16-year-old in the country. Volunteering for military service is an honorable choice, but young people should make that choice knowing what they are signing up for.<br/><br/>That being said, Band of Brothers is not all death and destruction. There's a rich mixture of personalities and relationships. We see the mundane details of a soldier's life, including the boredom, the humor, the goofing off, the camaraderie, the improvising of ways to get around regulations.<br/><br/>And we see the enormous toll this experience takes on the psyches--the souls--of these ordinary people who have been dropped into an overwhelming situation.<br/><br/>There's an extraordinary sequence at the end of Part 2 which begins with individual closeups of the paratroopers sitting silently in the plane which is carrying them to their drop point over Normandy. In each of the faces you can read the full range of emotions as they think about what's ahead and what they are leaving behind. Then the camera pulls back and we see the whole planeload of soldiers in their gear, lined up against the two walls of the plane. Then the camera shows us that plane from the outside, flying through the darkness and wisps of clouds. The camera pulls back further and we see the whole squadron of planes flying in formation. The last shot is from above: what seems like hundreds of planes, all flying in the same direction, and below them, hundreds of boats steaming across the English Channel.<br/><br/>What a waste. "From this day to the ending of the world, But we in it shall be remembered- We few, we happy few, we band of brothers; For he to-day that sheds his blood with me Shall be my brother..." --William Shakespeare, Henry V, Act 4, Scene 3<br/><br/>Maybe the only downside to this mesmerizing story that traces a typical group of United States platoons, "Easy Company", through their lives, trials, triumphs, tribulations, and deaths through war-torn Europe in the mid-1940's is that it never enjoyed a theatrical release. "Band of Brothers" has elevated the bar incredibly high for any future dramatic cinema that decides to tell a story about World War II (or any other war for that matter.) This is not John Wayne or Robert Mitchum pontificating platitudes atop podiums, or a couple of guys with radios watching explosions from behind a trench saying "We need reinforcements", or even a German high commander being flabbergasted by what he sees through his binoculars. This a look at the war from a completely different angle, from the angle of a fellow soldier, a blood brother who may not live to see tomorrow.<br/><br/>"Apocalypse Now", "Platoon" and "Saving Private Ryan" were the catalysts that sparked a new era of war cinema quite removed from the heroic clichÃ©-ridden and platitude-riddled drivel that graced many-a large screen for the first few decades during and after the war, such as "The Longest Day", "D-Day the Sixth of June", or "The Sullivans". (There were of course some very notable exceptional films, such as "All Quiet on the Western Front", "Paths of Glory", even "Casablanca".) "Apocalypse", "Platoon" and "Ryan" forged new perspectives of war that were at the ground level where the essence of human drama truly resides. In many ways, "Band of Brothers" is the culmination of this new cinematic territory, although you might argue it owes a debt to the original "All Quiet on the Western Front" of the 1930's.<br/><br/>"Band of Brothers" is not about a particularly heroic company, an exceptional company, or a famous company. "Easy Company" was probably just about as typical an American military unit as you will find--a para-trooping company consisting of many young men from a variety of backgrounds who were drafted into service in 1944. The story begins with the company going through the rigours of basic training at the hands of Captain Sobel played by David Schwimmer in what may be the best role of his career. Sobel is a hot-headed military trainer, good at re-creating possible wartime scenarios and pushing his men to their limits but awful at true leadership. When he pushes over the line by unjustly accusing a fellow officer, Major Winters (Damian Lewis), of not following orders, Winters calls his bluff, and Sobel's men begin to lose respect for him, which is of course fatal to anyone in command. But this is just a prelude to what will follow.<br/><br/>The real story begins when "Easy Company", now led by Major Winters, flies into the Western Front and fights directly with German ground soldiers in France. This is war at its grittiest and most unromantic. War as depicted in "Band of Brothers" is about constant fear, anguish, and disillusionment coupled with split-second decision-making and timing. A delayed decision or an ill-conceived tactic could mean the deaths of many of your company. The filmmakers conceived a look and point-of-view in which the viewer feels like one of the men, walking and running alongside them during battle. The ground-level fighting as depicted in "Brothers" may even surpass "Saving Private Ryan". <br/><br/>The other endearing aspect of the film is the characters. These are not bigger-than-life generals or colonels. These were young average guys, most of them nameless and lost to history, who liked cigarettes, sex, and playing cards. They talked about movie actresses, posted pin-ups of Rita Hayworth on their walls, and gambled using cigarettes. And in the field, most of them just tried their best to survive. <br/><br/>Being a hero was not necessarily on the forefronts of their minds. This is where the meat of real human drama comes to the fore which is I think the point of "Brothers". One minute their chatting at a campfire when one of their friends is instantly killed by gunfire. A medic dashing around other encampments looking for supplies for the wounded and dying. A soldier who hides in a barn to escape the notice of German soldiers who have arrived. Or fighting hidden snipers in what had been previously a very sleepy town going back to the Middle Ages. They hadn't seen combat since the time of Henry V. These are the real stories.<br/><br/>This is one of the best made-for-television series since "Roots" from the 1970's. These were just regular guys asked to accomplish a monumental task. And that is what is heroic. I cannot help but tear up when I watch this series.<br/><br/>The two best episodes in the series are Bastogne, and Day of Days.<br/><br/>It is simply one of the best depictions of the awful reality of what an experience was in the history of film.<br/><br/>WWII basically ruined one of my grandfathers lives and this film gives a glimpse into the horror and heroism that the war was. He was captured at Anzio and was in a German POW camp for 2 years. He's endured more than any man could escape unscathed.<br/><br/>Major Winters is a leader I'd want to follow in any situation.<br/><br/>We need more men like him in all eras of history. What can one add by way of praise to this stunning and gripping mini-series based on a remarkable factual story of a group of men -- "the greatest generation" - seemingly going beyond human endurance in the fight to liberate Europe from the Nazis. Based very closely on Stephen Ambrose's fine history, which I've now completed after watching the production, this is competent film-making at every level, and serious praise is due to Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg for collaborating to make this production possible. If I have any quibbles at all, they are these: First, I wish that multi-part mini-series would not have different writers for different episodes; no matter how much they strive for uniformity, you can spot the differences of tone and nuance. Second, I truly wish this series was twice as long, so the characters could be more fully developed. Based on the best-selling book by the late Steven Ambrose and produced by Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, this incredible series follows the men of Easy Company, an elite Paratrooper unit in the 101st Airborne from training for combat in Toccoa Georgia, through some of the toughest battles of World War II to the end of the war and after. Through these men we witness D-Day, Operation Market Garden and the Battle of the Bulge. We experience with them the horror of the Holocaust and the devastation of war-torn Europe.<br/><br/>Divided in to ten parts the series is true to Ambrose' book in every detail. The script and acting are flawless and done in such a way that one becomes attached to these young men and invested in them. You begin to experience the war with them. You cry when they cry, you laugh when they laugh, you are afraid when they are afraid. I couldn't possibly single out any one actor for praise because they are all so wonderful. From reading the book it is clear they have all done their homework and stay true to the personalities of the real men throughout.<br/><br/>Stand-out performances include Damian Lewis as Maj. Richard Winters, the best of Easy Company's many Commanding Officers. Lewis portrays a man with honour and dignity, who has his men's interests at heart at all times and is brave and selfless as well as loyal. Also worthy of mention is David "Ross from Friends" Schwimmer who plays Captain Herbert Sobel , Easy's most hated C.O. , a character so far removed from Ross Gellar it's hard to believe the same man can play such a different character. He perfectly portrays Sobels bully-boy personality and incompetence.<br/><br/>Other top notch performances include Rick Gomez as George Luz, the company Radio man and resident comedian who somehow manages to hold onto his sense of humour even in the toughest times, Donnie Walberg as Carwood Lipton, who effectively led the men through the Battle of the Bulge, Ron Livingston as Captain Lewis Nixon, Winter's closest friend and Easy's Intelligence Officer, who never fired a shot and Neal McDonough as 'Buck' Compton who was a brilliant soldier until he saw two of his best friends seriously wounded in Bastogne.<br/><br/>Honourable mentions to Michael Cudlitz( Sergeant 'Bull' Randleman), Eoin Bailey( Private David Webster), Shane Taylor ( 'Doc' Roe), James Madio ( Frank Preconte), Ross McCall ( Joe Liebgott) and Scott Grimes ( Don Malarkey).<br/><br/>Really though there are no bad performances in Band of Brothers. Prior to shooting the actors went through a two-week military boot camp as well as meeting with Easy veterans and conducting research and it all shows in the acting.<br/><br/>The episodes are beautifully and realistic shot from the beaches of Normandy to the Eagle's Nest. The score is haunting and fits the piece perfectly.<br/><br/>Perhaps the best part of the series is the interviews with the men of Easy themselves before each episode. Their memories are as vivid as if they were back fighting again.<br/><br/>If you are planning on watching a war drama make it this one! Band of Brothers is a compelling war drama based on the trials and tribulations of the elite 'Easy company of the 101st Airborn' division during the events of World War II.<br/><br/>B.O.B. depicts war in a very graphic and realistic tone and is done on such a large scale that it feels more like a really great movie as apposed to a television series.<br/><br/>Most of the actors are fairly unknown which works really well for this series as no one is type-cast and everyone really fits the roles they have been cast in. Even David Schwimmer was brilliant and I didn't think I could ever take "Ross" seriously!<br/><br/>I had heard many positive things about B.O.B. but put off watching the series for many years as i never have been hugely into War films and assumed that a television series could never pull off what epic war films such as "Saving Private Ryan" and "Full Metal Jacket" did in the past. Still, I recently took the series home on DVD for a really good price and watched an episode every night until it was finished (last night). Safe to say I was addicted from episode one but wanted to put off rating/reviewing the show till it was finished and I could take it all in and view it in it's full completion.<br/><br/>The show is quite simply put; absolutely brilliant! No episode is ever weaker than the previous and as soon as one ends...all you want to do is watch the next one! Graphic. Realistic. Emotional and often humorous, B.O.B. is everything you could ever want in a televised series or even a film and truly brings home the hardships and everyday tortures suffered by thoughs involved in the war right from training to the shock of landing in France under heavy artillery fire on D-day to the seemingly endless hell suffered in Bastogne and the "Battle of the Bulge" right up until the ending of the War.<br/><br/>The real-life survivors of 'easy company' do not refer to themselves as heroes but after watching B.O.B. there really is no other word to describe them.<br/><br/>We must never forget.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this series to anyone even if you are not really into War dramas as this is likely to be one of if not the best War film you'll ever see. Amazingly conceived. Brilliantly casted. Great execution. Terrific and engaging story. <br/><br/>What else could you ask for in a series? <br/><br/>If you haven't seen the series, I strongly recommend watching it chronologically -- order the complete series on Netflix. It's really a compelling journey to watch these soldiers and their transformative experiences. <br/><br/>I heard a rumor that a new series is in the work following the American soldiers fighting in the Pacific. Would love to see that!!! I really hope it happens. <br/><br/>Terrific work. One of the best series ever made . . . in my humble opinion.<br/><br/>Kudos to all those who worked on this project and brought it to life -- and thank you to the 101st Airborne who fought and gave their lives. I just bought the series on Blu Ray -- so much better than watching it again on the History channel and thoroughly recommended.<br/><br/>The producers, Hanks and Spielberg, were both involved with the most graphically realistic war movie of all time, namely, Saving Private Ryan. But that movie had a theme of hope (well, some hope anyway). This series, also about WWII, is simpler and more honest -- it's about war and it is totally riveting. There is something about the combination of heroism, leadership, humor, existentialism and random death that makes me watch it over and over again. It makes me regret that I wasn't part of it, yet eternally grateful that the awesome burden fell to others, all at the same time.<br/><br/>Some of you may not wish to understand the minds and emotions of men thrust into combat on any scale, but if you decide to watch one war story, this has to be it. I usually view anything regarding WWII that comes out of the US with scepticism and sometimes with downright indignation, as Hollywood has the habit of suggesting that the US won the war single handedly, so BoB came as more than a pleasant surprise to me. It showed that the US were not alone in their efforts.<br/><br/>This is a truly stunning series, powerful and profoundly moving, that shows war in it's true ugly light. I truly cannot fault it, and look forward to watching it again and again.<br/><br/>The segments with the now elderly veterans of Easy Co move me, humble me, and serve to remind us of the debt of gratitude that we owe them. Band of Brothers is that rare occurrence a miniseries that entertains and keeps the viewer engrossed at the story it tells. It centers on the major men involved in the 501 PIR The screaming Eagles. It starts off on the eve of D-Day as Richard Winters and Lewis Nixon think back on the early days of training and Currahee the mountain they climbed every day and the meaning of the word which is WE STAND ALONE TOGETHER,it becomes their motto. We follow them thru D-DAY and then MARKET GARDEN and the battle of the bulge each horrible step of the way we encounter the problems they did and how they overcame them and in the process became Brothers in every sense of the word. What really made this special for me was having Major Richard Winters and the other members of the band of brothers tell their story before the segments begin. We gain insight into what it must of been like to be one of the best of the best of the best. Tom Hanks and Spielberg have nothing to be ashamed about because what they did was create a work of art that is nothing short of amazing and very moving highly recommended. I have had the honor and privilege of serving soldiers for more years than I care to say (only because it makes me sound like an old men!) so I can attest to the quality of spirit and humanity it take to be a soldier. Although those I've been around have been from the Viet Nam, Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom eras, they have the same qualities and heroism of the men depicted in this mini-series. I'm so glad of the attention to detail that went into making this tribute to Easy Company and to the many men like them and I'm so glad that they showed both the fineness and the frailties of these men as human beings. Because that is what made them and continues to make them heroes in the hell of humanity's own making, war. Not that they are super-human, but that they are ordinary men from ordinary circumstances who show the kind of character that is possible in people we may pass in the street every day.<br/><br/>Perhaps you won't sob as I did during the episode that asked (and answered so poignantly) the question of "why we fight." But I hope that some of your soul is scarred forever by this mini-series so that you will always bear in mind the necessity that men like these should fight. Some day in the future President Bush will be vindicated as being right in stopping madmen just as these heroes had done in their time. For the real human enemy is the sickness of our souls unhealed since the Garden of Eden. And only when everyday men of character stand up against that evil in ourselves, and in those who seek to perpetrate it on us or others or those who capitulate to it, will we see the only good that can ever come of war. Nothing can be said that hasn't been said: see it. Band of Brothers is a pulls-no-punches look at the harsh reality of the life of paratroopers in the Second World War, and even more broadly it's a look at the horrors of war in general, and WWII in particular. It will punch you in the gut with its power and honesty, its beautiful writing and characterization, and its lavishly effective sets and costumes that perfectly work to draw the viewer in. World War II has never been presented with so much realism, so much attention to detail, and (let's admit this!) such a huge budget. The deaths are gory not for the sake of gore but for the sake of showing you, the viewer, what these men went through and why it must never happen again. The concentration camp episode is one of the hardest things to watch ever filmed, but it should be watched.<br/><br/>This isn't just great drama, or great entertainment, it's history that still manages to entertain and educate and enthrall. I never got a chance to watch BOB when it was on TV, so I've saw it this year. And I fell instantly in love with BOB. So I watched all 10 episodes, and at the end of the 10:th episode, it felt like i was going to cry. I don't know why. It wasn't sad tears, they were happy tears. I mean these men where heroes - no - ARE heroes. I loved every easy company soldier (well, not all, some of them where a huge pain in the arsenal). I love this miniseries because it's extremely realistic, it showes how the men lived during the war, from England, to D-DAY to V-E DAY. Even how a day in a life of medic was. And the actors were brilliant, when my sister told me that David Shwimmer was playing a serious officer, that he was in BOB at all really shocked me. David Shwimmer?! But he did a great job, so did the guy who played SSGT Bill Guarneaure (spelling may be extremely incorrect) Nothing can describe it.<br/><br/>I love Band Of Brothers, from beginning to end, and I can watch it over and over and over again and love it even more.<br/><br/>And the commentary from the "real" easy co men really showes that this is for real. They lived through all of that. Sobel, D-Day, Bagstone, Holland, Germany. All of that. And it's breathtaking. This may give us a tiny glimce at what these soldiers went trough to win the war. You simply cannot help loving this mini series.<br/><br/>I salute the Band of Brothers! this is one the most stunning and realistic per-trails of world war 2 other than I have ever seen adding that it is a true story all the characters are real and appear before every episode to comment on what each episode is based on. episode 9 ( why we fight) is absolutely heart breaking I had to watch Schindler's List to cheer up! every person who watches it will develop a favourite character out of the stellar cast. As we follow these "band of brothers" from the moment America joins the war to there joyful end of a bitter war containing the deaths of your favourite characters. I advise that everyone who has a soul and is still breathing to watch this you'll be in tears by the end. (watch out for the episode with the battle of the bulge) Band of Brothers is hands down the best movie/miniseries/docudrama/anything ever made about any war in any time period. It was just so real. It had a distinct non-Hollywood feel to it. You can just feel everything that all the soldiers felt. It takes you through every emotion they felt, from elation to despair, fury to love. It also took me through every emotion. When Webster gave the little Dutch boy what turned out to be his first chocolate bar, I cried. You could just feel the camaraderie between all the men of Easy Company. It also gave perspective on what the Germans(both civilians and soldiers) went through. They weren't all pure evil like Hitler. My favorite character is obviously Winters, with Guarnere a close second. Winters was just a steady force whatever post he was at. In my opinion, the best episodes are "Day of Days" (Part 2), "Bastogne" (Part 6), and "Why We Fight" (Part 9), but they were all incredible. It is a perfect job done on an unbelievable story.
