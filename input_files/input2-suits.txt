SUITS is smart, sassy, clever, sophisticated, timely and immensely entertaining! The new series debuted with a full 60 minute story that establishes the characters very solidly, opens pathways for many story lines, and boasts an exceptional cast of fine actors. Here is hoping it makes it as an ongoing series, especially since it is not yet another crime drama! Not that Criminal Mains, The Mentalist, Without A Trace will lose their place among the best show on television, but with all the spinoffs on the crime shows, the available choices have been dwindling lately. <br/><br/>SUITS is a lawyer show. Set in New York (captured, by the way, in beautiful cinematic vistas) it focuses on a very successful law firm, managed by Jessica Pearson (Gina Torres) who balances the talents of her two top lawyers, the smarmy Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman) who is a control freak, and the very brilliant but egotistical Harvey Spector (Gabriel Macht). There is a particularly appealing and very bright secretary Donna (Sarah Rafferty) and a beautiful paralegal Rachel (Meghan Markel) and last but certainly not least by any means there is Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams) - a young lad who is extremely bright, has a photographic memory, dropped out of college because he took tests for fellow students and got caught, fell into marketing drugs by default for need of money so that he could pursue his dream of being a lawyer, and falls quite by accident into the role of being selected as associate to the brilliant but self absorbed Harvey Spector. This is the team of characters who are destined to provide fascinating substories as they interact. <br/><br/>The dialogue (Aaron Korsh and Sean Jablonski) is clever, bright, snappy, unclichéd, witty, and helps define the complexities of the characters. The pacing is exceptional (directors Kevin Bray and John Scott) and the series has the appearance of a high-end movie - excellent cinematography, expansive development of story in well-selected locations - but most of all this is a cast that is worthy of attention every moment they are on camera. It will be interesting to watch how Patrick J. Adams and Gabriel Macht grow into our psyches: both are exceptionally fine and provide a spectrum of the lawyer personality we haven't seen on a series before. This should be a major hit! <br/><br/>Grady Harp It has been a while since I have discovered a series I truly enjoy watching. Some are way too stupid and then others are way too boring, and then some have horrible actors and the list goes on.<br/><br/>However, in this little gem, everything is exactly right. The script matches funny and serious, silly and smart, everything at exactly the right amounts. The actors act well. Watching this show is a generally enjoyable experience which, I think, is a lot when it comes to some recent series.<br/><br/>I would recommend this to anyone who likes 'House MD', 'How I Met Your Mother' and other series that are often watched to feel better after a long day. I really liked the show for the first several seasons. Mike and Harvey made a great team that was fun to watch. Add in Donna and Louis and it was a really entertaining show. With Mike's trial they took a real turn to heavy drama. Then when Mike and Rachel leave the show, it goes downhill fast, and you can see why it's now canceled after a concluding season. There is no humor after Mike aside from occasionally Donna, and instead it is just one argument then backstab after another. After finishing every available episode of House, Bones, Fringe, and Prison Break, I found myself at a loss of what to watch. So as I was browsing for new TV Shows, I stumbled on this one and decided to give it a go.<br/><br/>I am very picky about TV series' but this one really captured me. After not expecting much, it really caught me by surprise how great this was.<br/><br/>It reminds me of Law & Order but with more drama and a following into the characters lives. It reminds me of "House" in many ways. It features a strict boss that will do anything to get the job done, and an employee willing to do anything for his boss.<br/><br/>It is certainly a new age show that will bring in audience from all ages from teenagers to seniors. I guarantee that you will not be disappointed with this show, as many new shows have disappointed me. I am writing this review while the series is on its fourth season, so I will try to avoid very specific spoilers for those who are about to giving it a chance. Even so, I have to refer to the development of plot lines, so if you are a beginner, perhaps it is better to stop reading.<br/><br/>Suits' Pilot was frankly very engaging and interesting in terms of characters and situations, bringing a new turn on "another lawyers' series". I loved it instantly. It was frivolous but witty and sassy, the dynamics between Mike and Harvey was magnetic, the production was elegant, and the constant threat of revealing a serious secret was a compelling argument to keep watching a show. It also had humor and certain characters (like Donna or Louis) added enriching details.<br/><br/>The series had a bright first season, in which Mike's ordeals and his master-disciple relationship with Harvey were at the center of the plot, and Mike's exceptional gift with memory played a fundamental part in the development of the plot line, justifying why the cheating was sustainable and why he could actually be an asset at the lawyers firm.<br/><br/>Suits maintained interest and quality in the second season, with other characters gradually becoming stronger and widening the plot.<br/><br/>But starting from the third season I started to observe a gradual decline in the plot line, and the exhaustion became conspicuous in the present, fourth season, the weakest of all so far, to the point that is has now, really, become "yet another lawyers' show".<br/><br/>Mike's exceptional abilities have completely disappeared from the action in seasons three and four, and now he has become a bland character with nothing standing him above any other ambitious young executive. Jessica's new romantic interest is utterly unbelievable and it has negatively weighed in the show. Louis has been portrayed as a clown in seasons 3 and 4, and instead of being funny, he has become anti-climactic and unbelievable. Donna's place as Harvey's "counsellor" has been overextended and her "knowing things in advance" is, in my opinion, overused as a clisé.<br/><br/>In short, the series had something different at the start, and it has veered into the road of losing its original allure and interest in a very noticeable way.<br/><br/>PD: Jessica's amazing wardrobe, though, is always a pleasure to appreciate. And yes, as others have remarked, all the female characters seem to be cut with a same stereotyped template. Patrick J. Adams & Gabriel Macht both give convincing performances in the pilot, something sure to excel even more throughout the series.<br/><br/>The script, acting, and quality are all flawless, as far as television goes. If you're looking to be highly entertained on Thursday night, then look no further. The subtle humor, creative plot, and enjoyable dialogue entices the viewer more with each passing moment.<br/><br/>If you're into legal shows that include all aspects of human nature, including compassion, then Suits is for you.<br/><br/>Hopefully this show continues to have the opportunity to thrive; it has definitely drawn me in and I won't miss a second of it. Suits is a compelling legal drama set in the heart of New York City at one of the city's most successful law firms. The story is centred around the firm's best lawyer, Harvey Spector (Gabriel Macht), an egotistical, uncompassionate, charmingly witty Harvard graduate who will do whatever it takes to win – "The best closer this city has ever seen"; and his associate Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams), an under-achieving compassionate genius with an eidetic memory who strikes lucky by having the opportunity to work at one of the highest profile legal firms even after being caught for attempted drug trafficking and without the required qualifications. The show follows both characters as they face different legal and personal challenges in each episode whilst maintaining the gregarious and quick-witted rapport between the two.<br/><br/>The show offers plenty of variety besides the law by developing the relationships of many characters inside the firm, "Pearson Hardman", managed by Jessica Pearson (Gina Torres), a career-minded powerful woman. Jessica must balance between her two best lawyers, a devious Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman) and Harvey, whose relationship is filled with rivalry and playable banter, is certainly one to make you laugh. The show also follows the stories of the beautiful Rachel (Meghan Markel), a paralegal whose test anxieties are stopping her from fulfilling her ambitions of going to Harvard to study law and Donna (Sarah Rafferty) a smart, sexy secretary.<br/><br/>Besides the two leading characters, Suits is balanced excellently with an ensemble cast filled with intriguing relationships and an original and sharp script combined with the beautiful backdrop of New York City to make this a thoroughly enjoyable TV show which I can't help but grin ear-to-ear from start to finish and I hope it continues its high standards for seasons to come. Suits is brilliant. I am very pleasantly surprised by this show and will certainly continue to watch it. The characters are likable and, with the exception of "Mike Ross," a page out of real life. I can guarantee you that there is not a single lawyer at a high power NYC law firm that didn't go to law school. Additionally, no lawyer as green as Mike would be given so much attention. Here is where I will cut the show some slack- without such deviations from the truth there would be no show.<br/><br/>Some reviewers liken this show to House but with lawyers. Sure, there are some common elements surrounding Harvey being cold-hearted and cocky yet excellent as his job. But this is where I want to draw the distinction: characters like Harvey actually exist in this world (minus the likability). There are charming, proud, extremely competent, rude, driven, and ruthless lawyers in every major firm in every major city. At some point it becomes a requirement of the job. Doctor House meanwhile is too much of a self-destructive train wreck for my taste.<br/><br/>If you want to get a glimpse into working at a high power law firm, an investment bank, or any other high stakes pressure-cooker job look no further. Keep the insane hours, lose the friendliness, and amplify the cockiness and voilà: a glimpse of reality. This show keeps the bad but throws in the good, so instead of feeling like work, the show instead feels like entertainment. After watching the pilot episode I was pleased from what I saw. The episode was long enough to give us a glimpse into some interesting characters. There seems to be a lot to go around with both leads social lives and how they impact the secondary characters. There Is no shortage of eye candy. I did find some of the time lines a bit of a stretch, but nothing major. I most enjoyed how the writers took the time to give good background material on just about the whole cast witch I think Is becoming so rare, knowing this info helps to get into these characters from the start. I recommend this show to viewers who like a lawyer type show with just a touch of softness. I have watched all seasons.... unfortunately.<br/><br/>Originally the drama was tense and fun. The bromance between Harvey and Mike was also really interesting. However, over time the sparkle disappeared and the magic of Mike's amazing memory seems to have disappeared alongside it. Instead of being fun yet tense, the show has evolved into a continuous screaming match and people panicking about mundane nonsense. Made up drama that feels too forced to be entertaining.<br/><br/>Live. Die. Repeat.<br/><br/>Every episode seems like a catastrophe for the firm or the people. They resolve this by yelling at each other or trying to be really clever. Unfortunately the clever seems to have turned into everyday unspectacular. The characters are now just bumbling ants without direction and without any capacity for passionate relationships. Even Mike and Rachel or Harvey and Donna are washed out.<br/><br/>Worth a watch up to about season 3. Thereafter, it turns into a slow and agonizing death of a show. When I started the series, I enjoyed suits and would probably give it an 8.I quickly realized that it fell into a cycle that was unbreakable :The same things seem to happen over and over again . It just becomes so repetitive that the " new " narratives just aren't interesting enough to satisfy you as the viewer.They also seem to exaggerate quite a bit at times so it really does not feel realistic at all. Began as an amazing show. Each season got worse and worse. Must have changed writers, producers, and directors multiple times. I think it was around seasons 5 or 6 where it had just become painful to watch. Spectacularly ruined!!!! when i first heard about this TV series i thought why bother its probably stupid ! how good could it be ? but then i thought you know ill watch the pilot and give it a shot , why not ? before i knew it my eyes were glued to the screen from beginning to end and i enjoyed it to the fullest . this show in a way reminds me of "house MD " a TV series with a lot of knowledge and brains and in the future will show many law cases which will be won by these guys , a top of the line lawyer named Harvey and a genius without a degree named mike who when hears anything or reads anything remembers it forever . and i strongly recommend this TV series to anybody who likes to enjoy themselves because trust me this TV series ain't boring ! This was an amazing show with a cast of actors who have great chemistry together. <br/><br/>After setting aside the hour and a half allotted for the show, I was happy I did! <br/><br/>It follows a young adult who is struggling with his life who finds himself thrown into a job as a lawyer after he is hired by a big shot, charming 'closer. <br/><br/>After the pilot episode, I am hooked and look forward to seeing this show on USA every Thursday! <br/><br/>As long as they keep the comedy and drama coming, I will be an avid watcher for life. I have watched all the episodes and became increasingly disenchanted with the show. Too much melodrama, not enough substance. I am a person who loves legal dramas, anything with convincing courtroom scenes. The initial premise of an unqualified lawyer with a photographic memory was interesting but this plot was quickly relegated to the back burner. Instead each show became more typically an average soap opera where the main characters were routinely thrown into conflict with each other and starting keeping secrets and telling lies to each other. This is the staple diet of any soap you care to watch and the easiest way to create tension and drama. The love affair between Rachel and Mike was juvenile and it got to the point where I would fast forward when Rachel came into view - all she did was to complain about Mike and life in general. Finally I have to say that at the end of season 2 I lost any interest in Harvey, he seemed selfish and isolated and I could not understand his position at all. He was fighting everyone and for what reason ? Suits is my go-to series. I got hooked right after watching the first episode - one of the best pilots ever, EVER.<br/><br/>When I don't have anything else to watch, I always rewatch suits. Pick any episode, it will still give you the feeling as if you're watching it for the first time. Smart, finesse, swag, name it all - Suits has all of it.<br/><br/>But, it went downhill after Mike Ross left. Suits was Mike and Harvey. It should have ended after Season 7. I watch a fair amount of TV and think that I have fairly selective tastes in shows, but Suits was one of my favorite recently produced shows. The first season was bold, smart, and very polished. This is one show that definitely deserves HD. Harvey Specter was by far one of the best fictional lawyers out there. One of the best parts of the show was the focus on the "case of the week" idea, and all the clever dialog and intricate legal drama that came with it. The third episode with the boardroom battle over control of the car company was a kind of 'everyday-epic.' Another highlight was the inclusion of three very smart female characters: Donna, Rachel, and Jessica. Most notably, the primary characters had a powerful and flawless way about them that justified their "it's not about caring its about winning" attitude.<br/><br/>Sadly, the subsequent seasons have quickly degenerated. The smart female characters were transformed into gossipy shrews who now appear on screen just to spark inter-office drama and occasionally look good. Gone is the intricate legal maneuvering (ie crown jewel defense), replaced only with on-screen commentary on supposedly brilliant off-screen meetings or court appearances we never get to see. The witty banter has been dulled by a sheer lack of originality, such that the characters seemingly make the exact same jokes, only with different pop culture references. Worst of all, the writers (who must be high off the first season's success or the weed they purchased with the money from it) have turned all the powerful characters (Harvey, Jessica... etc) into flawed shells of former characters hardly fit for big firm life. This done of course to pander to the "average viewer" who tunes in to follow the lawyer version of days of our lives with pretty girls lusting after handsome men. Based on the level infighting in the firm, its a wonder how they log any billable hours at all. The only saving grace of Season 2 was Louis Litt's mostly solid character development.<br/><br/>The end of the second season allowed the show to reach a new low by introducing a British takeover of the firm with a host of odd new British characters (ie Louis's big eared British counterpart) thrust into the show just for simplistic comical value, which I'm sure a select group of slack-jawed simple viewers might thoroughly enjoy.<br/><br/>I write this review in the hope that some executive, writer or actor on the show might happen upon it, realize that their show is rapidly in decline and right the ship before even loyal viewers like myself simply tune out all together. The show achieved a lot in Season 1, but much of the acclaim was lost by way of lazy writing and lack of imagination.<br/><br/>Lastly, its a law show, you'd think they would cover the legal side a bit more than as a basis for Donna to bang a Brit or Rachel's dad to meet Mike.<br/><br/>UPDATE: This show has devolved to nothing more that a nicely filmed soap opera that has little connection to legal reality nor to intelligent discourse of any kind. I just removed it from my DVR. Suits is about a lawyer Harvey Specter, the best closer in New York who gets an apprentice, Mike Ross, a kid so intelligent who remembers not only everything, but also seems to understand everything.<br/><br/>So far so good.<br/><br/>But that's where the interesting part ends. The rest of the whole show is about cocky, faceless robots who want to be the the biggest smart-ass in the room. Even that is not so bad, but the quality of the dialogs are of a 14 year old. <br/><br/>The show lacks humor. Of an adult that is. The show misses also excitement, because really everything is predictable. Every episode is almost the same, just the topic is slightly different, and different clients.<br/><br/>Don't see it. I did, but found myself staring at my phone or the newspaper most of the time. "I am missing something. It has an 8.8. That's higher than Boardwalk Empire. Which is a good series." But no I wasn't missing something. It's bad. When I watched the first season, I was so impressed and excited at the same time, because I thought I stumbled upon a classic series, but, boy was I wrong. The first season is amazing, the second one doesn't upset you, but from the third season, everything becomes boring. More and more people know about Mike's secrets and everything supposedly becomes okay when Mike is back to the firm. The show talks a lot about "real world", but fails to make itself connect to one after the first two seasons.<br/><br/>The fourth season is not good, but it's not bad either. You could watch it, and not kill yourself, but from the fifth season I am not sure. <br/><br/>One thing I really LOVE about the show is the characterization. The characters are some of the best in the TV industry. But, the whole plot and the stories with the same old antagonists and motives are really boring. I think the show should have ended in season 2, or 3, because after that it's just not the Suits that everyone loves anymore. By chance and luck, Mike Ross is saved in the nick of time by a lawyer one night during an escape from a shady marijuana dealing that had gone wrong. Harvey Specter, renowned as one of the top lawyers in the city, is in the midst pf recruiting for the "right" law associate. <br/><br/>Coincidentally, Mike is faced abruptly by this job opportunity that is definitely able to bestow him the money he urgently needs to cover up for his grandmother's medical funds. Facing a major life-changing decision, Mike decides to go for it instead of partaking in illicit activities for the rest of his life. Mike affirms he makes the appropriate position for Specter, and manages to impress Specter with his deftness in retentive memorization. However, having no genuine degree from Harvard, needless to say any formal college degree, lingers as an ever-present issue. Realizing no other man Specter had interviewed so far possessed the same sense of intelligence quite like Ross, Specter is willing to cover up for Ross and his background to land him the job as his associate.<br/><br/>I am fairly pleased to see this new show making its way into a hit television series. It's been time they've come up with something new since Law & Order. Suits does start well, although a bit clichéd. If you can ignore that, you probably can enjoy the first season. But, that's it and nothing more. It just keeps getting more shiny by every episode. You can see the pattern even from the first episode. But by the end of second season, it gets too self-inflictive and boring.<br/><br/>Obviously its about a law firm and we have two protagonists who are nothing less than super humans. One is a pro in the field and have a little boring troubled past and the other is a highly intelligent junkie who drops out of college but finally ends up joining the firm. We also have some more professionals in our firm and some rivals, none too strong. Every one is of a different personality but none of them have any depth. Well, the entire show doesn't have much depth. Our two protagonists are almost always way too cool for you and me or for anyone else for that matter. Well, Ross is a little less cool, but he makes up for that with his superhuman abilities.<br/><br/>So, who can stop them from winning every case? Of course, NONE. Remember, they are studs. All you'll be watching is the other characters scheming and whining around while our heroes crack down things and get their way.<br/><br/>Can't say much. I just lost interest in it. If you care for some character depth, I'd suggest you to skip this. The first couple of seasons are a bit watchable, nothing more. However, there are better shows and this might not be worth the time. Sure, the genius who got kicked out for taking a test for someone else could never find another law school that could ever accept him. Ever. Uh huh.<br/><br/>And sure, first-year lawyers within a firm are always trying to undermine one of their own - how else to be competitive?<br/><br/>But then, we've always got the parents to come along and admonish the kids to get back to work: "Jerry, have you got that Loughton case ready?" And like the kid caught with his hand in the cookie jar, Jerry stops smiling and scurries back to his desk.<br/><br/>And everyone spends a huge amount of time out-snarking the next guy. After all, how are you going to make the day go by without a few awkwardly-veiled threats, criticisms, and more than a little boasting? Even mommy has to threaten to fire someone for underperformance at least once each episode.<br/><br/>Snark passes for wit; undercutting another passes for work; winning at all cost passes for contributing to the firm; and unrealistic interaction passes for drama. Update on 8/21/2019<br/><br/>There's no sense to go on. These characters leftover now only delivered hollow dialog to each other by verbally creating situations in those empty office buildings. This series should call quit when Mike and his wife seek new location to have a new life and lifestyle. It's already become a nuisance to watch this new season's every episode so far, so painful and annoying. Please call it off whenever you could. Have a new life......
========================================================
Well, after some of the most important roles in this series left, the newest Suits S08 has become such a painful hollow slow cooker without any tasteful ingredients in it and kept deteriorating episode after episode. We can see so clearly that this series' budget has been cut and decreased hugely, so what we see in Season 8 is just a bunch of the familiar faces added another two walking around in an almost empty leased office space in business suits, yadayadayada like a bunch of old wives just delivering boring dialog to each other, or some boring internal fights over "whose name should be added on the wall" and nothing else. The office is almost as empty as a theater stage with some furnitures and several actors. Nothing worth seeing anymore, just like the Emperor's Clothe, under it, Nothing. It's time to wrap up and beg off. Edited to 1 star because it's just GARBAGE. Doesn't even deserve 1 star but it's the lowest rating allowed.<br/><br/>---
The show is entertaining up to the point that it questions the viewer's intelligence.<br/><br/>A legendary lawyer in what's probably the most competitive city in the world takes a chance on a drug-dealing pothead, who pretends to be a Harvard educated lawyer. OK, sure, what the hay.<br/><br/>Except the pothead, Mike, can't get his excrement together. He can't even *look* like a lawyer, which could be easily done by getting a decent suit and stopping riding that ridiculous bike. Sorry, but in New York City lawyers working at top firms don't ride bikes to work, especially not with messenger bags slung across their chests. He looks like a frat boy working as a bike messenger.<br/><br/>Then Mike starts messing up left and right. He has no sense of professionalism and his boss as well as the managing partner of the firm - seriously - keep putting their butts on the line for him. That simply would not happen. And every time Mike messes up big his superiors threaten to fire him but instead of firing him they keep giving him more chances and letting him handle/interfere in high profile cases.<br/><br/>Mike's unlikable and arrogant, and I just keep hoping he'll get hit by a truck and die. By the second season Mike, the pot smoker who used to get paid to cheat on college entrance exams for other people, the guy who kissed his best friend's girlfriend, the same one who sleeps with a married woman etc. etc., starts his right/wrong tirades, believing he's doing the right thing by betraying client privilege when he shares confidential information with the prosecution. And his top dog boss still doesn't fire the guy.<br/><br/>Like, no. I thought that Suits might be something of a mix between The Good Wife and Damages while being primarily about men (because women don't really wear "suits") but I was disappointed to learn that it was none of the above (other than just a show about men who wear suits and 'powerful' women who only wear revealing dresses). The characters are unsympathetic and the plot is all-too mainstream. Frankly, it has been done before (like in the late 90s).<br/><br/>In the world of Suits, a young rebellious genius without a law degree (he was expelled from college) is hired to be a lawyer at a prestigious law firm that "only hires Harvard graduates". Seriously? Give me a break. This is the first problem with the show: unrealistic, unimaginable, and yet overly pretentious all at once.<br/><br/>While it is "based" in New York, the scenes are clearly shot in Toronto (Second Cups in the background, and a row of yellow taxis lined up on Bay Street, as if taxis in NYC just hang around outside of office buildings in the financial district). I find the show cheesy to put it simply, and somewhat of a wannabee in the legal drama genre.<br/><br/>I generally agree with the majority view on IMDb (for the most part, broadly speaking) but the ratings for Suits are off the charts and I have no idea why! Am I missing something? Suits is not a high quality show. Have a closer look for yourself and see what you think. When one thinks that he has seen it all in American TV, Suits comes into your screen. If you thought that you had enough of wise guys, self-pretentious empty characters, imbecilic screen-play and high society pseudo-morality, you were very wrong. Suits delivers all that and more of handsome men and gorgeous women, entangled in a mock- scenario of a low-life hyper-prodigy chap with no degree, but superhuman cognitive powers, that reaches the top in the flick of an eye, and stays there effortlessly and with plenty of ... style (at least the type of cheap style envisaged by the show's creators). Stay away, and you will not cry for the lost time. Life is too short to waste it in something like Suits. I don't understand how people can be this excited about "Suits" and even compare it to shows like "House MD". What made the latter great was its unflinching (if somewhat biased) glance into the human psyche, the way it looked at the anxieties, the lies and the little betrayals that the characters on the show liked to sweep under the rug but that ended up coming back to haunt them, often in dramatic and life-threatening ways. That, and the contradictory and vulnerable characters the show placed at each other's mercy.<br/><br/>"Suits", however, is not like that. It doesn't have any of the inquisitiveness and candor of "House". All we see on this show is a group of young, pretty, rich, high-powered yuppies who are too cool to care about anything. The main characters always get the last word, know the wittiest response, look the most elegant. Everyone "gets it" or ends up as a loser on the sidelines of the show. Basically, all the main characters (and most of the supporting characters) are the same. Of course, Mike is still a bit wet behind the ears and thus not quite as stylish as the other characters. But that's the only difference between him and the other protagonists.<br/><br/>That's why it was impossible for me to care about anyone on the show. It's not interesting to me to follow the journey of people who excel at everything without showing any kind of depth or conflict. Of course, the characters on the show have their flaws, too: they are "too committed to their work", they are "too straight-forward", they "can't keep their opinions to themselves", etc.. In other words: they have exactly the character traits their job calls for. And we are supposed to accept these "flaws" as somehow adding complexity to the characters at hand?<br/><br/>The show has some intelligent plot lines, that is true. I enjoyed the way the lawyers were trying to best each other, spinning the issues at hand around, looking for the little detail that could help them - it's an interesting show concept. Also, the acting is pretty good. But after 6 episodes, I grew so tired of the bland characters that I skipped to the middle of season 2 to see if there would be any character growth. There wasn't. The main characters were still the same as in the beginning.<br/><br/>The boring characters are what kills this show for me. If I want to see effortless success, I can always watch my washing machine. It has more soul than this show. Suits, an obvious emergence in television set around two super-brained lawyers who get away with the stunts they pull only because the script allows it. The writing of this crap is so unbelievably juvenile and ushered in, I'm really surprised anyone can watch more than 4 episodes of this. <br/><br/>Every episode is an exact copy of the previous one, with different client names and situations. Every slick rebuke that is uttered by either one of the main characters is so unbelievably set up, they might have read them off a menu.<br/><br/>Everything about this series feels fake and concocted. The high score this series gets from its audience either gives testament to the lousy offerings at this moment or the lack of taste of the general public. The show started out great, but went downhill fast.
Almost everything that made the show great is gone by season 4. Suits started as a promising TV series. The characters had a little something in those first episodes. There was a hidden promise that they could evolve, the plot seemed to be heading somewhere. And then, too soon, Suits became a parody of a TV series. Bad acting, flat boring characters with fancy clothes, dialogues deprived of any depth or whit. After the second season it was -and remains still- nothing but a bunch of people screaming empty threats at each other. The background of the main characters is used with no imagination to prove a sallow point every now and then when the weak plot needs a way out. No plot, no characters no reason to even take a look. I cannot wait until next week to see how it all plays out. Gabriel Macht is an amazing actor, I don't know if it's because of his performance, his good looks, or because I am in law and studying to be an attorney, but this show is incredible. Incredible isn't even the word for it, but I am so happy I watched it! <br/><br/>Not only is based out of one of the greatest states of all times, but the chemistry between the characters have together is outstanding. I can definitely relate to this show in more ways then one. And that's what I love about the script, and roles these Actors are playing. Gabriel Macht usually plays a bad ass or handsome love affair but this show makes me see him in a totally different way. <br/><br/>Patrick J. Adams has the cute little boy next door look, you would never guess him for a drug dealer, but he has to do what he has to do in order to get money...and survive. But then "Harvey" gives him a shot at a once in a lifetime opportunity, which in reality people would kill for, especially in this economy, which by the way they mention by doing Pro Bono cases. And Harvey's boss Jessica talks about you would be lucky to even still be working. I don't know if I am going to like Rick Hoffmans character yet, will see. <br/><br/>Great work, please keep writing, directing,acting and work together, because this show will do well, and it will be hard for people to let go of this one.and now will be a life long fan! Can't wait to see what happens next.....! Suits is one of those shows where once you start watching it you can't stop. The chemistry between the characters on this show is phenomenal! There are a thousand shows about lawyers but this is BY FAR the best one and the most original one! I can not recommend this show enough! Perfect mixture of intensity, love and comedy.
The only show ive watched which had the power to completly emotionally attach me to all the characters. Amazing soundtracks and dialouges 😍 Gripped from the opening episode and loved it all the way to the very end.<br/><br/>Great acting, great chemistry between the cast. Love it, and now miss it.<br/><br/>Well worth a watch The last 3 seasons, its gone down.
Now its all about posturing and treatning. Could'ent even finish the latest season. To bad. It's a new show and because of positive reviews I though I give it a shot and I was absolutely hooked. First thing that came to me was that I got the same vibe around there as watching House MD. I'm not sure if this is about solving cases and helping people being collateral damage or not. There are some similar things in characters, you know it when you see it. Like one of main characters, Harley is kinda reckless, arrogant, narcissist, brilliant human manipulator, who secretly cares. Mike is he's sidekick I guess, who's also very smart, but have had a lot of set-backs in life and got another chance thanks to Harley. He seems to be very open about caring for people, clients. I think two of them complete each other. but to sum it up i guess i would say if you like a show with bunch of very well played mind-games, with light humor here and then, with slight romance, interesting characters and cases.. good acting with good script! You definitely will love this. I absolutely suggest it. Worth watching. And oh I wasn't trying to imply this is a rip-off ..of something, because it's not. Used to be good but after few left the show, show it self went down to just a lame soap opera This is ridiculous. After seeing the three first episodes I was watching this show for how depressingly bad it was. The show is all about who is the biggest prick and cockiest jerk. There is literally almost the same plot in every episode. And the plot is pretty bad, the acting is crap, the script is toilet paper. Nevertheless, the show gets 8.8 in rating. So, is this show better than Homeland, Walking Dead and Modern family? And almost as good as Game of thrones, Dexter and Breaking Bad? I mean WHAT THE FUC!?<br/><br/>This a human tragedy...<br/><br/>-Stayzor's out Non-existing plot is the first thing that you will notice about this fake, concocted and fast paced show that is filled with over acting and unrealistic events.<br/><br/>This is a show that the actors made just so they can wear a suit. Awful waste of time. I gave this show the benefit of the doubt by watching the first season and was absolutely disappointed by the end of it. <br/><br/>The lead character doesn't have a clue as to what he's doing. His "enemies" are dumber than he is but apparently they are all very cunning and bold because they are wearing suits and are dragging they feet on New York sidewalks. <br/><br/>I wouldn't be surprised if the good reviews posted here for this were from the cast members and producers. <br/><br/>Not recommended. I was recommended this series by a friend of mine. I must say he was not wrong in recommending, well at least initially.<br/><br/>But season two onwards the show has been more about office politics and less about lawsuits. I kept on thinking the show would come back to its core theme in a while but it never did.<br/><br/>While it does make a compelling thriller I think all those who would want to watch the real lawsuits are not going to like the season 2 and 3 much<br/><br/>I am not aware of any of you have watched Boston Legal. But in my opinion it is the best series when it comes to lawsuits. It covers wide array of topics from socio-political to corporate lawsuits and has been one of the most impressive series ever. I love suits and feel very sorry to say it does even get close to the Boston Legal - the masterpiece.. Suits is one of those shows where once you start watching you can't stop. The chemistry between the characters on this show is phenomenal! There are a thousand shows about lawyers but this is right there at the top! Suits is a great TV show. It has all the drama and comedy you need to keep you enthralled with the characters and their storylines. To be honest it did start to get pretty repetitive and I did start to lose my initial stay up all night to watch several hours of episodes, after a few seasons in but I didn't lose enough interest to stop watching altogether.<br/><br/>Unless you've been living under a rock you'll know that Meghan Markle had to stop acting because of her royal nuptials so thankfully her character is gone for season 8 & 9 and the character Mike Ross isn't in it as much either. The focus is predominantly on Harvey, Louis, Donna and some other newer main characters. The dynamic is really fantastic and I believe they could have easily kept the series going for another few seasons. I realized when Mike was featured in those seasons how much he really had started to annoy me. I had grown to hate his character. I was disappointed they didn't give the rest of the characters the chance to make the show their own.<br/><br/>However the producers ended the show perfectly with season 9. Last night I tuned into the TV premiere of the TV show "Suits" which is broadcast by the USA network. The show is about a twenty year old under achieving drop out named Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams) who earns a living by taking various test and entrance exams for others. He's blessed with a photographic memory which he uses to impress a senior partner, Harvey Spector (Gabriel Macht), during an interview for a position as an associate at Harvey's law firm. Although he does not have a law degree, Ross has taken the LSAT numerous times. Ross uses his photographic memory to impress Spector, causing him to break one of the law firm's major rules—only hire Harvard graduates. Ross with no degree of any kind certainly does not qualify for a job.<br/><br/>The premiere episode of the show keeps you interested from start to finish. It mixes just the right amount of drama and suspense to capture the attention of the audience. I must say TNT could take some cues from USA, on the right way to premiere a show-- with limited commercial interruption and a pilot episode that leaves you wanting more. The two lead actors are properly cast for this project. Each actor epitomizes his character, a twenty year old slacker and a high powered suit with a narcissistic personality. Gabriel Macht has appeared in well known projects such as "Behind Enemy Lines," "Middle Men," "Whiteout," and his most recent "Love and Other Drugs." His co star Patrick Adams doesn't have a significant filmography but has appeared in numerous TV series such as "Flash Forward," "Numbers," and "Ghost Whisperer" with this being his most consequential role to date.<br/><br/>I give the premiere of this show an A- and have high hopes for its future prospects. I would recommend this show to anyone who likes an interesting drama that could be on TV for many seasons to come. USA network has definitely strengthened its summer lineup with the addition of "Suits" alongside "Burn Notice" and "Royal Pains." Check out my newly launched blog at: www.logansmovieblog.blogspot.com I love lawyer dramas so I was drawn to Suits. What ruined it for me is that I could not cheer for the 20 something associate with a key eye for details and instant recall of legal cases who stumbles into a one-in-a-billion short cut to becoming a lawyer with a major law firm. Once he gets in the law firm's door, the writers turn him into a whinny idiot who does not deserve his rare opportunity. He can't find the internet, legal software, law books or some resource outside of the law office to help him fill out even basic legal forms for important clients. No, he has to bug his coworkers who have their own work to do and, of course, it does not go well. The point here is that it is completely unbelievable that he would not have been not fired in his first few days. His mentor, a supposed top attorney, does not show any real courtroom talent, just ego and attitude. Suits might have worked as a satire of other lawyer shows if it had been played for laughs. As is, this is a dud. Season 1: Great - Season 2: Good - Season 3: Meh - Season 4: What the?<br/><br/>While this show had a fantastic first and second season, it loses steam in the 3rd season and is completely all over the place and just plain unbelievable towards the end of the 4th season (current episodes). Not only is the current storyline completely unrealistic (a guy who is seen earlier in the series to cry about his cat suddenly becomes the show's most revered lawyer and is able to single-handedly crush the two partners who thus far have been proved unbreakable by even the most shrewd lawyers and tycoons, really?) and just plain silly, there is really no coming back from it. Once they turned Luis into the villain he could never realistically be, this show lost all its appeal to me. Its become completely unwatchable as these characters cannot go back from this and evolve and grow. This is really too bad because it was quite a good series. I recommend watching the first two seasons and skipping the rest. Suits started out as a very credible show. Always homing in on an awkward case with the intricacies of defending their client. Thrown in was the interactions between the characters. So far so good. Then came this final series. What a joke! Do the producers actually think that this is entertaining us? The whole premise is about showing facial expressions along with slow hush hush speech. It's shocking. This final episode of Mike going to jail is more like a Laurel and Hardy offering. Add to this the dress sense of the boss of this huge law firm and I can't help howling with laughter. Forget our marriage, forget what the gangsters will do to me in prison, I have to go to jail in order to be true to Harvey said Mike to his Bride to be or not to be. See you in two years when I get out. Hopefully this show has run it's course and we will not be confronted with this drivel again. Although it had an 8.8 rating on IMDb, I was very skeptical of Suits at first. It looked like one of those shows where everyone is young, good looking, successful, and full of witty comebacks. You know, one of those shows that look kind of like, well, every other show out there. Admittedly it was with a bit of surprise that I found myself enjoying the first season. It wasn't a masterpiece, but it was certainly an enjoyable show. I expected that after the solid first season that the show would only improve.<br/><br/>Instead, Suits fell into a downward spiral. Season 2 continued to play on season one's successes but also took it's first steps towards becoming that "just another contrived show full of good looking people making witty comebacks" show. By season 3 logic seemed to go out the window as the show turned cheesy and downgraded central characters to buffoonery. The show was becoming something of a soap opera. The show came to revolve around who said what to who when, how they said it, and who is lying to who. Characters became stuck in one dimension. Plots seemed to repeat only with new characters (all young, good looking and unbelievably successful, of course).<br/><br/>Cue season 4. In season 4 the downward spiral fell to new depths. The show no longer seems to be about the trials and tribulations of Mike Ross, but almost entirely about sappy romances, office gossip, and petty grudges. To be more blunt, the show has declined into a preteen drama. If you are a clingy 14-year old girl who wants to gossip to your friends about what Donna heard Rachel say to Mike about Harvey it might be intriguing (no offense to all the 14-year old girls out there) but compared to what the show used to be, it is a disaster. I find myself skipping entire scenes because they are simply annoying. What may be even sadder is that I spend a good chunk of the other scenes on my phone looking up things on Google. I just don't care how about who is lying to who or about how long characters can keep their relationship a secret at work. It's lame, and it isn't what made Suits a good show when it started.<br/><br/>All in all, there is no way that this show (all seasons accounted for) deserves an 8.8. Not even close. Really, watch other 8.8 shows like Boardwalk Empire, The Shield, Six Feet Under, Homeland and Dexter and then tell me that this show should be rated anywhere near them. Season 1 may have been an 8 (or so) but honestly by season 4 the show has declined to a 3 or a 4. Season 1: a young man with eidetic memory and a job that consists of taking entrance exams for others ends up employed masquerading as a lawyer from Harvard. Can he fit in without the real law school experience? Mentored by one of the best lawyers in New York, if not the country, I guess we'll see.<br/><br/>Season 2 and following: But then the story line changes to sex lives of the many unique characters, lawsuits that are decided by lawyers without their clients' consent, depositions that never seem to last more than a few minutes, and routine criminality among the various lawyers. One guy sneaking into the legal field is plausible. But when every officer of the court is a criminal, even the guests brought in from time to time, the story starts to become just silly, if not boring.<br/><br/>Leaving the episode to episode story aside, the characters never seem to grow, improve, or to even realize their singular dimension. How many times do we have to hear Harvey say "I" beat you. How many times will his secretary pine like a lovesick teenager? Will Louis show why he is supposed to be a great lawyer (no) or just be the nerd that everyone jokes about (yes)? Frankly, it's now just a boring wait for the imposter lawyer to find the key document that will let Harvey win again. So sad to see Mike's character depart the show. I'm sorry to say that I can no longer watch! With out the dynamic between the two characters, Harvey and Mike I can't continue to support the show. Farewell Suits. I watched the series premiere but won't watch its decline. Every show now is 75% of characters apologizing for stiffing each other. It has become a joke, time to pull the plug. The plots are non plots, the lawyers spend more time arguing with each other than doing any law work, do they ever go to court. Louis really has become a parody it's no longer funny. Deep 6 this crap. I went through seven seasons of SUITS, and was generally involved and impressed. But now that the two most interesting and sympathetic characters (Mike and Rachel) are gone, and Katherine Heigl has been added to the mix, doing her usual "tough woman" boring nonsense, the show is no longer worth my time or money. How many unsympathetic characters can the show support? I regret having purchased the 8th season, and probably won't get through it.<br/><br/>What a shame. This was a good show a few years ago. I never post reviews, but based on this season, I had to review this. The writing is ridiculous....it is now a joke. They must be purposely sabotaging the series. This show started AMAZING! Great premise, great characters, great story.<br/><br/>Then it seems like writers didnt have any other ideas.
In the last seasons its like recycle the same things over and over and over again.<br/><br/>Where are the new ideas? New stories? And now killing mike is like a whole new series. Nothing resembles the S1 anymore. A really promising series....or the first few seasons, but then it felt like a merry-go-round that I wanted to get off. Too many similar scenarios and ridiculous outlines in trying and keep viewers going back for more. Are there any lawyers out there who´d like to give us a picture of what the real world of corporate law is like? Now they have introduced a so called actress. A Prima Donna of the screen who tries so hard to justify her pay with over-achievement to a point of grating ones teeth. Sorry, the writers should go back to the drawing board and give it a fresh coat of paint. Warning: spoilers.<br/><br/>Overall, season 5 was a letdown. The second half with Mike Ross' will he-won't he I would rate with 1. It only proves that you can have photographic memory and be a retard.<br/><br/>Someone as intelligent as Ross is supposed to be would know his only chance was to fight till the end. Or, as he already did in another season stop working as a lawyer and do something else such as finance.<br/><br/>There is absolutely no logic in not waiting for the verdict and taking a guilty plea at the last moment. He had to know the consequences is all the procedures he touched would be tainted and opened to lawsuits, destroying the firm and its partners .<br/><br/>THe hundreds of back and force in the last episodes are as tiring for the viewers as they are illogical and senseless.<br/><br/>As senseless as letting down everybody 5 minutes before the wedding after having spent days lobbying everybody into attending.<br/><br/>Frankly, this makes Ross more antipathetic than ever, and I couldn't care less what happens next.<br/><br/>I'll try to keep the fond memories of season 1 instead. As you can tell from the title, i am not at all happy with Suits.<br/><br/>I used to be a great fan of this show, but i find that it's changed for the worse in a bad way; yes, shows change over time, but something about Suits is just not right.<br/><br/>Let me quote you the IMDb description of the show:<br/><br/>"While running from a drug deal gone bad, Mike Ross, a brilliant young college-dropout, slips into a job interview with one of New York City's best legal closers, Harvey Specter. Tired of cookie- cutter law school grads, Harvey takes a gamble by hiring Mike on the spot after he recognizes his raw talent and photographic memory. Mike and Harvey are a winning team. <br/><br/>Even though Mike is a genius, he still has a lot to learn about law. And while Harvey may seem like an emotionless, cold-blooded shark, Mike's sympathy and concern for their cases and clients will help remind Harvey why he went into law in the first place."<br/><br/>See, that was what this show was. It was a villain-of-the-week episodes show, with a touch of continuity, and our heroes were a weird bunch. THIS MAKES SENSE. It makes sense to have ToughLawyer(tm) and SuperKid(tm) tackle unusual law cases in what is a LawProcedural(R) TV show, with BackstabbingColleague(tm), SassySecretary(tm) and ArrogantBoss(tm) thrown in for laughs and plot advancement. This is proper film writing.<br/><br/>It might not be art, but we never expected art. Just give me some decent acting and a good story to enjoy.<br/><br/>Instead, we get a completely transformed show that has nothing of the original setup and tons of really bad stuff. Here is a quick overview of these, because why not.<br/><br/>Mike, as SuperKid, *IS* the show; his intuitions through his photographic memory are akin to Sherlock Holmes', Gregory House, or even the reveal at the end of each Scooby Do episode. Its what makes the show. Its what makes it interesting. The law procedures embodied by Harvey, which keep the show down to earth and give it gravitas, are just there to unfold as plot lines, so our HEROES can defeat the Bad Guy Of The Week.<br/><br/>Instead now we have a character show with far to many characters, primarily based on the love story between Mike and the GF; then there is the Backstabber (Louis) who has gone from jealous douche to Criminal Mastermind, in one of the worst flanderizations in the history of; Mike's "shady past" has gone from LimitingFactor (R) to his superpowers, to agonising impending doom. Jessica will just as well occasionally pull off some incredibly evil act, as will every other character, trying to force what was once a light-hearted show into a romantic/suspense drama.<br/><br/>Besides the fact that you DO NOT change typology once a show has started, do the writers really think that people who wanted to see a stoner/genius HERO, now want to watch a show that makes you cry and cringe at the desperation their characters feel? It's like making Magnum PI into a horror film, or the A-Team into a political show. Or turning The Love Boat into an action series.<br/><br/>This show started out really good, but its become terrible. The dialogue and story lines are completely unrealistic, the tone is depressing, the plot drags on and the aforementioned changes are unwelcome. There is nothing, nothing left in this show to watch. <br/><br/>My vote (from once a solid 8/10) is now: 5/10<br/><br/>I would watch this maybe if i was eating and there was nothing else on TV. I and many of my colleagues are avid fans of Suits. With Gina Torres,Gabriel Macht, Meghan Markle, Patrick Adams and Rick Hoffman, it was all interesting and lively. <br/><br/>Then it became more of a Susan Rafferty show demonstrating how super smart she was and slapping any man just because she believes she is a goddess and always right. 
As the show progresses, it became clear that this legal drama show is not based on truth or even partial truth about real lawyers but fantasies. Poor legal depictions, stupid courtroom antics and faked showdowns of the lawyers makes this tv show more unbelievable. 
What started as an easy to watch and exciting lawyer drama tv show has turned for the worse in 2018. The two male leads are worlds apart. Both in terms of the story and as actors. Gabriel Macht is quite polished as Harvey Specter, the tough lawyer with a soft side. But, Patrick J Adams just doesn't really fit as his young protégé, Mike. Someone like a Penn Badgley would be more believable in the role. Regardless, the Mike character just doesn't work. <br/><br/>While the cases and legal aspects of the show are entertaining (more of the pro bono stuff from the first season would make it even better), the character development and overall believability, aren't. We're supposed to see Harvey as tough but moral - yet he's committing fraud by hiring Mike. It's the underlying premise of the show, but it's implausibility never leaves your mind and you never really lose yourself in the show. <br/><br/>Apart from Jessica (and possibly Katrina), who is outstanding, the female leads are boring. With most of the romantic relationships also taking away from the show. Especially Mike and Rachel. I can't help thinking the show would work better without Mike and Rachel altogether. <br/><br/>The legal drama of the show is great and some of the characters are fantastic (Harvey, Jessica and Lewis). But you just cannot escape the flawed premise of the show, or its annoying characters (Mike, Rachel, to a lesser extent Donna). The hubs and I just binge watched Suits. We both really enjoyed it, and we rarely agree on TV and movies. So sorry to see that it's recently been cancelled.<br/><br/>We loved the characters, also loved that there never seemed to be a weak season, or any jump-the-shark stunts. Just solid writing, solid acting. Sorry to let this series go.<br/><br/>Continue without Rachel. She wasn't the strongest character, the show can go on without her, but definitely bring back Mike. After listening from my friends about this series, I decided to watch this show and the minute i started to watch this show, I can't get it off my head. It is a smart series with sophistication, cleverness, solid character build. Harvey Spector and Mike Ross are the two main characters and I haven't seen this kind of duo in a while in any series. Suits is a lawyer based and not any criminal drama based series. Pearson Hardman is the law firm which only take Harvard Graduates and Mike who is no Harvard graduate takes his place gradually inside this firm. While Building characters thi show opens up to new stories and exciting ones too and that's what i liked about this show a lot. This show is one of the best I've ever watched, the dialogue is really great with the movie quotes it becomes better. The chemistry between Harvey and mike is unbelievable, the songs and music they use makes you think that they're made just for the show and I'm sure its the best in that category. The show started great, the first five seasons were amazing. 6 and 7 and 8 would've been good if some things didn't happen which I don't want to say because of the spoilers. the last season was good and the ending was my top 2 endings in all the shows I've watched. If you came here to see if the show is worth your while, let me tell you this it is and there's no way you'll regret it Patrick j Adams and Gabriel are convincing!
I love a show that gets to the point and Suits does just that so beautifully and is consistent.
I hate it when Jessica Pearson leave the show coz it ends up having a soapy feeling. But you still feel the original suit feeling.
It's great! Let's start off with one of the best drama shows in television. I agree it may not be perfect and can be unrealistic at time but brought some good humour. The good season were 1-6 but after that it went downhill and became a soap opera but at least it got a decent ending.<br/><br/>Most of the characters get annoying in the later seasons and the bearable ones are Louis and Harvey and Jessica. Even though I like mike and Harvey friendship mike becomes more irritating when the season comes later by complaining and whining about everything
I like Donna in the beginning but after season 5 she became annoying
Rachel is one of the most annoying characters, I've always feel like she always plays the victim all the time
Oh my god I love Jessica Harvey and Louis they bring flare and drama without being annoying unnecessary drama
Overall it's an excellent show not perfect but still will be an iconic show Awesome show! Except it drags a too long and becomea a little less interesting by the time it reaches season 8 and 9 Suits is a legal drama tv show with Gabriel Macht and Patrick J Adams in lead roles. The great Harvey Specter will never leave you bored and so does Mike Ross. Mike Ross (Patrick) will impress you every moment you watch the series. Rachel Zane(Meghan Markle) who starts as a paralegal end being a lawyer, and apart from the legal drama, there's also a romance going parallel to the drama between Mike Ross and Rachel Zane. They're the most adorable couple the audience always wanted to see together. Then comes everyone's favourite Donna Paulson(Sarah Rafferty) who impresses you the most with the best character. Coming to the other lead roles include Jessica Pearson(Gina Torres) and Louis Litt(Rick Hoffman). Jessica might not impress you at the beginning but she's one of women you'll miss at the end, a bold women who no one hates! Louis Litt is an amazing character, Rick Hoffman's acting is just bomb!
These 6 play the lead roles of the legal drama and will impress in any episode you watch.
Mike Ross' smartness will leave you a ever lasting impression.
In a nutshell suits will impress you from the beginning and that impression will last till the end. I've fallen in love with this show,<br/><br/>It's been a long time since i didn't get attached to shows, but suits is a different story.<br/><br/>I cannot really say what i love the most is this serie, because all in all it's just AMAZING. The script, the actors, the production, the building of characters, the variety of emotions you can feel in the same episode, some episodes made me cry and laugh at the same time. This show not only talks about law, and money, it's talks about all kind of human problems, psychological problems, poverty. It also teaches great lessons about life and forgiveness, it opens up about a lot of taboo subjects. And all of it threw different characters( lawyers) who became family at the end of the show. A good episode reminded me of the old episodes . Michael and Harvey's relationship is beautiful. I'll miss them a lot This is such a good legal drama, cuz it stands on quite the compelling premise, and you're hooked on the characters faster than Louis has a change of heart, or Harvey does an about-face (& marches away after a dramatic telling-off). But wait, now they're spewing some legal mumbo-jumbo... don't worry, that's not what the show is about, though with a little perseverance you can learn a thing or two. Soon, you too will be regarding "by-laws" with newfound reverance.<br/><br/>Make no mistake; this is a story of arm-twisting, extortion, wheeling-and-dealing, and downright one-upping like you've never heard before. But, oh, the chemistry between the characters! Will keep you blissfully unaware that what you're beholding is nastier than an octagon bout. Whether it's depicting the budding relationship between an associate and a senior partner, or between two passion-possessed hearts, development proceeds at the most satisfying pace conceivable. It's also agile enough to portray such conundrums as a woman whose bottom line is always her firm, but who, in the long run, never turns her back on her employees.<br/><br/>At the firm there is no letup in the workload, and this seems to have rubbed off on the actors, who deliver non-stop scintillating performances. Also- decent music selection. If I have any complaints about this show, it's that the maneuverings can be a bit over the top. So what, it's all part of the fun! I strongly recommend to watch it. Something new in the world of the stories. I'm currently half way through episode 7 of season 7 and I have to admit that I have just turned it off through complete boredom.<br/><br/>This show started SO well. The premise was interesting, the characters sharp and the comedy was brilliant. Donna was fabulous, Mike & Harvey slick and were the guys that got s**t done, Louis was the guy you loved to hate and Rachel & Jessica are beautiful, intelligent and strong female characters. The story-lines were interesting and on some level believable.<br/><br/>However, since Season 4 the writing is just repetitive and becoming more and more ridiculous. How many more times can Louis stamp his feet and scream at people he supposedly loves and respects before 'humbly' apologising and then saving the day with some random piece of evidence buried in a long forgotten by-law? How many things can Harvey blame his mother's affair for? How many times can Mike lie and get away with it, purely because he's got a quick mind? you get my meaning, it's just repeating the same story-line with different guest characters.<br/><br/>It's a real shame because there are very few TV shows I follow, I usually give up after a season or 2 and I felt invested in this one, I especially loved the Mike/Harvey bromance that developed but in all honesty...I cannot be bothered to keep watching, there's nothing holding my attention and I only got this far into 7 seasons because I didn't want to give in.<br/><br/>But I'm throwing in the towel, I am giving in. started hesitantly to watch this series, but the more i watched the more i got addicted to it. best thing about the story line is that the suits team have managed to keep it unexpected and full of twists. you never get the feeling that it has become a circle of similar episodes over and over again. the strongest attribute of this series is its script which is effectively delivered by the actors. well written, well directed and well performed. the intensity of drama never dies. along with it the cleverly conceived humour is simply brilliant. the guest stars have delivered wonderful strong performances. i hope it continues beyond season 5. This season of Suits has proved to be the most character-driven of them all. <br/><br/>The battles at the firm seem more like a backdrop to the internal struggles each of the characters is facing than the central conflict of the show, and what we see of their professional lives at Pearson Specter Litt only mirrors the private changes that are taking place away from work.<br/><br/>The emotionally-charged mid-season finale shows what happens when those two worlds, personal and professional, begin to violently converge. Harvey confronts one of the most difficult choices of his adult life to make yet another difficult decision regarding his "family" at work. Mike revisits a tragedy in his past to get guidance for his future with Rachel. Jessica reminisces on her failed marriage to remind herself just how much she has given up for the sake of the firm. Louis has to choose between Jessica and his sister.<br/><br/>The recurring choice seems to be: your family at work or your family at home.<br/><br/>The firm or Rachel. The firm or Quentin. The firm or Esther.<br/><br/>The episode manages to juggle all of these interwoven plot lines fairly well, and still manages to deliver each of these new developments with a remarkable depth of emotion. The flashbacks do seem a little out of place at times, and their extensive usage in the span of one episode makes them feel a little forced. Though the writers of the show are known to make things up on the fly, these past revelations would have been more effective had they come earlier.<br/><br/>All in all, the mid-season finale proves to be an excellent installment that asks (and answers) some of the tough questions we've been pondering, taking on a tone not often seen in such a humorous and feel-good show. The last scene was both unexpected and welcome--we all knew it was bound to happen--but by wrapping up other story lines, the episode still manages to be a satisfactory ending whilst keeping the audience impatient for more. Very entertaining Eighties-style 'loadsa money' brought up to date! Great comedy drama with a subtext that money and power corrupts everything, including the law. Full of the kind of characters that have mid-life crises wondering what they've done with their lives.<br/><br/>Beautifully shot and edited with a great sound track. Some stellar performances that further develop characters that are in reality paper thin.<br/><br/>At first, I felt empathy for anyone that could be drawn into corporate law as a way of life until I remembered that, as with much of corporate life, most of those involved for the long term are psychopathic in their pursuit of power and money. A sad eulogy for an industry whose only real benefit is that it forces people to question their motives, get out and discover themselves. I stumbled upon Suits through a web advertisement of all places (first time I've actually read one and had it do anything but annoy me). But it caught my attention enough to stream the pilot and be interested enough that I'm now half way through the second season. Realistic? No. Entertaining? Extremely! I know the premise is ridiculous, but the show is just fun. A combination of funny, drama, satirical, and I don't even like Harvey but it's just fun to watch regardless of the extreme personalities and unrealistic stories. But part of what I like is it doesn't pretend to be realistic, it just entertains. Could turn bad at any point because things are loosely bound together but I doubt it as that is part of its appeal. New, only 20 shows in so only so much has happened, but I like it so far and it makes me smile, laugh and entertains!<br/><br/>The risk of rating a show that is still in production is of course the change that is going to end it. While Suits hasn't been cancelled as of this date, I feel it coming. While my review was fine based on being in Season 3 the story definitely loses a lot of its likability in the seasons after. I still think it is a good show, just having more to rate it on I have to lower my rating for the same reason I originally gave it a 9. By season 5 the entertainment value is in decline as my expectation is that there will be no season 6. But most shows lose something towards the end (not all, example Breaking Bad), but most. I'm struggling to care at this point and actually hope there is no season 6 so there is no attempt to revive ratings at the cost of quality. It was good for the duration it was good, time to call it and wrap it up at this point. I'm sure I'll watch it again, but the first 4 seasons will be the reason why. Smart writing is only one element of a great show - the cast/characters also need chemistry. Suits has it all in spades.<br/><br/>Mike and Harvey are great together. The writing is tight and they feed off each other - it's so much fun to watch.<br/><br/>Do we have to take a leap of faith that he would hire someone as a lawyer with no degree - Yes. In the grand scheme of current shows, this little nugget is perfectly acceptable and even believable considering that Zuckerberg never graduated (tell me who would not hire him because he has no degree). Plus, every show needs a hook - here it is folks.<br/><br/>Regarding Louis as being one dimensional - I am not in agreement. His character just emulates those people who are actually one/two dimensional in real life; they do exist.<br/><br/>Where some shows take you for a ride via backseat, Suits takes you Shotgun! Buckle up b@tches... The shift for the series was going down when they made a big role for dona
She should have stayed as a secretary as a funny character
And she is not a pretty actor
I was rating 10 stars before
Now i feel generous to give 5 This TV series was really promising with good pilot, first and second season. And at some point it started turning more into soap lawyerish drama without this what it used to be. I would rate this TV show higher when it had been finished around season 4. It has it's own pattern that becomes annoying when you see it in every episode. But hey - you need to find it by yourself. I liked season 1-3. Not your typical chain smoking, show.<br/><br/>Season 4+ does what all the other TV shows do, it turns from a court drama to a daytime melodrama. <br/><br/>The season 4+ writers turn the job over to interns and children of the producers.
I rate S1-3 with a solid 7 and S4+ as a solid -1.<br/><br/>The whole S4+ show is arguing, bickering and childish manipulating. They spend 2-5 minutes on actual courtroom a$$ kicking. With Mike and Rachel on the show at least there was an interesting side story. Now with them gone it just the same old lawyers screwing each other and their clients. Not worth watching anymore unless you like that sort of thing. As a lawyer, the problems I have with this show are the same I have with many shows about lawyers. It is often clear that the writers don't know anything about how being a lawyer actually works. I can forgive missing some of the more nuanced things, but they should have at least gotten more of the basics right.<br/><br/>The biggest glaring problem is that Mike Ross did not pass law school and therefore does not have a license to practice law. A lot of the show's drama is built around the fact that the firm has to hide this to allow him to continue on. However, every state bar has a database where anyone can simply look up your license. Not to mention there are many other checks in place that would prevent a nonlawyer from getting away with pretending to be a lawyer for so long. The show would be just as good if they had simply brought him in as a paralegal who helped the other lawyers and then financed him through law school or something. It's really an unnecessary plot point that comes up again and again and distracts from an otherwise pretty good show.<br/><br/>My other quibble is that every character in this show constantly breaks rules of ethics and behaves in ways that lawyers don't. I don't understand why writers of lawyer shows don't simply consult with a few lawyers before finalizing their scripts. Sadly, this is common in pretty much every show about lawyers. In spite of this, the show is really good, especially compared with other shows of its kind. My wife and I came across this series on Amazon Prime streaming programming. We started watching it from episode 1 of season 1. Right now we are almost finished with season 2. Most episodes are about 42 minutes long, made for one hour time slot with commercials. We often watch 2 or 3 episodes a night.<br/><br/>The premise is set in the first episode, Harvey Specter is a great lawyer and senior partner in his firm. As he is fond of saying "I never lose." As he is looking to hire a new associate, interviewing one after another Harvard law graduate, Mike Ross suddenly and frantically appears at the interview venue. Mike Ross has no degree, he is a petty drug dealer, and takes the BAR exam for others for cash, he is a genius with a photographic memory but no degree. In spite of all that Harvey hires him.<br/><br/>Therefore an ongoing issue is who else will find out that Ross isn't really a lawyer? Specter and the firm obviously would get into lots of legal binds when or if it were found out.<br/><br/>As the characters flesh themselves out we meet Jessica Pearson who is the managing partner. We meet Louis Litt who is a brilliant lawyer but also a petty, deceiving chipmunk. He and Harvey are always at each other. Rachel Zane is the highly talented paralegal who desperately wants to pass the BAR and attend Harvard Law School. Donna Paulsen is the pretty and smart assistant to Harvey. <br/><br/>Season 1 has the best stories, as we are getting through season 2 we are losing a bit of interest but overall it is an entertaining diversion. We will probably keep watching.<br/><br/>FEB 2017 edit: We are now into season 4 and the show is still keeping our interest. We watch mainly for the characters and their interactions, the actual stories are secondary. Louis Litt is a great character.<br/><br/>MAR 2017 edit: We have completed season 4 and now are in season 5. My interest has been piqued again, a nightly ritual to watch 1 or 2 episodes when nothing else is on regular TV.<br/><br/>AUG 2017 edit: We just finished watching season 6 on DVDs from our public library, things changed quite a bit, not the least of which was Mike's stint in prison and Jessica's decision to follow her heart. After so many episodes the characters have become even more interesting.<br/><br/>AUG 2018 edit: We just finished watching season 7 on DVDs from our public library. While Jessica has moved on and now in Chicago she still turns up from time to time. Mostly a series of interesting storylines and Litt continues to entertain. Maybe this time next year we will be watching season 8. It took me a while to get around to watching Suits, and I'm more then glad I did eventually get around to watching it. It's be far the most clever and sophisticated lawyer show I've ever seen. It's also wildly outrageous, funny and loyal to its viewers. Nothing really faults this show, except the fact that each episode is fundamentally the same, but that doesn't matter when it does its job of making it addictive. <br/><br/>A must watch show that doesn't become too full of itself, nor does it insult the viewer with excess of unwanted material. It has strong romance, comedy, drama and crime themes that makes every episode as fun as the last. I had this show rated 10/10. I had to change it to 9/10. Not going to mark this as a spoiler but everyone who has watched this show up to and including season 7 knows or at least I believe agrees, season 7 should have been the series finale. Tried watching season 8 and just couldn't do it so in my eyes, the show ended after 7 seasons and was BRILLIANT. No need to watch this any further because in all reality last episode of season 7 WAS the end of this show! My opinion and believe it to be many others opinion. Taking off my watch list. Thank you Suits, for SEVEN seasons of perfection! Ok, so suits had me in Season 1 - original, exciting, funny and engaging. Somewhere in Season 2 though, it hit me how there were so many things wrong with the whole concept of this series, and I think the producers caught on to that as well and eventually worked their way out this whole mess that was Mike's storyline. But this came at a heavy price... and in the process, the series just kept on recycling unnecessary friction between characters to keep the show alive. Has anyone noticed how empty the "Suits" offices have become? Well, so have the plotlines... It's like a reality TV show, with a slightly bigger budget. No wonder everyone loves it so much. I think that after "The Good Wife" and "The Good Fight", the bar has been set sky high for any series involving lawyers. After being a loyal fan for many years of Suits all I can say is that I want Harvey back, he was once bad arse and is now a pushover, its like LA Law has gone to therapy in season 8, jeez, give it back some teeth. It's embarrassing. After watching almost from the beginning, what used to be a fairly interesting drama has become an almost constant parade of ego maniacal sociopaths whining about who is smarter, tougher, shrewder, etc. Last season Harvey was increasingly acting less like a bad ass lawyer, and more like a spoiled brat who freaks out when he doesn't get his way. The current season's story arc makes it even worse by focusing on the show's main weakness: the fact that Mike is exactly what the prosecution says he is, i.e., a fraud who cheated his way to where he is, and dragged all his friends down with him.<br/><br/>I'm hoping the whole crew gets sent to jail. Some Spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>Granted the show has some good characters and sharp dialogues. But so far, no case has been good enough. It is just too average. And I am not blaming it for being average. I just don't understand the 8.9 rating (I know how the rating system works.) Now, let me point out some stuff that bothered me. In the first episode Harvey hits on a waitress and she denies. Next shot goes straight to his house where they just had sex. That is not just cheesy, but also lazy characterization. Mike Ross' aunt or grandma being in the hospital is not exactly original either. The next few episodes have some good stuff but nothing that justifies the hype. I will not be continuing further. As I have much better shows to watch. My friend just put it on... I couldn't see it from where I was standing but on hearing some rock song playing while some opening bedroom action was about to happen, made me think, "contrived mindless lyrics over the top of some tired riff regurgitated trying to be hip". But the reality is that this program is dismissed by those occupying that rare level of intellect, who are socially ahead of the general rabble, aloof as required but still able to communicate with others if required. The conceited attempt of all that this program tries to conjure up fails. Why? Because the writers cant create the correct ambiance, atmosphere,subtleties, nuances and everything else that goes into making the very very limited great shows there have been (like BB). Why can't the writers of Suit do this? Well it's because they are just like that unsophisticated rabble that rave about it. Statistically if you want: Not the bottom 25% of the populace. It's the lower/middle/middle- upper group making up the bulk of mindless Suit lovers. Then after that there's the upper (where these stupid writers and creators think they inhabit). Because being at that level, they will never be enlightened there is another movement above that. That is the top most 5% -that group I alluded to above. Yes I know what you the reader is thinking... what implausible rubbish. But you would. You resemble those who dismissed for 150 years of there being another very secret calculation to quantum probability that theory amplitudes well beyond the sub atomic level now bringing finality to life as it is now, exposing further origin revelations and later what will happen -all of a sudden. In all the billions of universes. All at the same time. Now, in the future and simultaneously in the PAST! Oh My God (pronounced 'Janice in Friends'way) The viewers never seize to amaze me. Not in a Michael Jordan way. In a negative way. Trailers shout wildly proud that some brain dead entertainment site calls it 'wildy good' and '32 million viewers cant be wrong'. Really? They can't? Why not? People used to think the sun revolves around the earth. And earth is flat. More than 32 million people thought that. And they were all wrong. So saying 32 million people follow it in this case just means mental illness has taken over obesitas as the nr.1 disease. Doesn't prove AT ALL that those people are right. <br/><br/>And this shows gets a 9? A 9!?! In that case the fart I just released upon this world should get an Oscar. At least that didn't bother anyone. Well, my dog is used to it.. Suits is a soap. And not even a good one. ALL pose, looks, the story is completely enslaved by the incomprehensible need to make sturdy looks in the distance after any news hit the characters possible, no substance whatsoever, not troubled by any need to make anything remotely realistic, and even in the need to seek cheap sensation it crushingly fails. This show is quite appalling and I feel sorry for whoever enjoys this. Such mental poverty you must live in then. <br/><br/>Suits should come with a warning label. It may kill your brain cells. No, it WILL. After watching the fourth episode, I was one of the first reviewers of this show (August 2011), and my review concentrated on the good/the bad and with a desire to affect narrative shifts/development (hopefully producers' minions read these things, and I think so given the show's subsequent development). Caveat: I write about media as my profession, and, again, I rarely take time out to write this kind of stuff because I have enough on my plate. But, SUITS has emerged as a private indulgence. Yes, it's an L.A. Law remake (and there are still issues with genre -- "what does it want to be?" is still a problem), but it's a much more self- conscious and playful show, and the writing is brilliant, evoking noir-like banter. After two years, and my original review, I am happy to see the show develop its women characters (and not overly sexualizing Jessica, like before, one of the most powerful African-American women characters on television) -- I like the new stylists' choices of making her stylish/sexy but not overly Ally MacBeal, such as the use of asymmetrical dresses/suits during episodes when she was in conflict with Harvey or Darby (nice homonym, by the way). But, what's the deal with all of the bags/purses? Professional women don't bring Hermes Birkin bags to every in-office conference (I think I have counted the number of purses in a shot, and it's kind of astounding, enough already with product placement). The "Rachel" character has also developed. I was a little worried about scene changes: those establishing pov shots that focused on Rachel's bootie, but then there was a funny complementary shot focusing on a woman looking at a man's bootie. Rachel is developing as a character; that said, the actress who plays her needs to eat a muffin, as she's tubercular these days. I keep expecting her, out of starvation, to fall over the copy machine. Still love the filmic banter (meta-cinematic references to film culture, super fun and opens up the show), and now it's not just btw Harvey and Mike, but is extending across the show/characters (even to Louis). And, yes, Louis. He's still a caricature, but he has pathos -- yes, he's a comic relief figure but also a person now. And, I think my favorite episode this season was the great Cat Trial, which made me laugh out loud in its surrealism. The show is now much more bifurcated, but in a good way. It attempts to explore legal culture (but it does not glorify such work, as it examines the economic determinism that runs against humanist ethics) but also has these really fun, outrageous, implausible fun sub-narratives that are about human empathy, struggles and, well, neuroses. And, what is legal culture but the expression of human neuroses? I like where it's going because I don't know where it's going, which is a rarity. That said, as a suggestion, I think it needs to exteriorize (beyond the lame Game of Thrones line) & open up the space of the firm. And, Mike Ross is now kind of in limbo. I still think he should go to law school and maybe now with Rachel (as a means of personal legitimization?). Could be some fun scenes of them being equalized in law classes. You will never see more brilliant ideas forming or important decisions being made while walking the halls of one of the most spacious and elegant NYC office spaces anywhere.<br/><br/>Averages about three "hey, can I talk to you for a second?" per episode. It's so repetitive they stick out like a sore thumbs every time they say it. It's impossible to ignore once you notice it, sorry if I ruined it for you.<br/><br/>More times per episode than the "hey, can I talk to you for a second?" are the blue folders with 40 page motions which they rely on these far too much for simple plot explanations. Now, I know I'm a slow reader, but these people read the first pages of these motions and put it all together in 2 seconds or less- every time.<br/><br/>But, all that said, if you find beautiful people who are always impeccably dressed and looking their best, than it is hard to look away. Cookie cut scene, the actors might as well hold up their lines and read them aloud. First we have short bursts of anger and confrontation; then everyone's apologetic or there's some corny antidote someone has to spew out in some kind of melodramatic way.
Scenes cut from one office to another office with no interaction from any minor players like we had in the past. Story lines jump from one to the other like a steeplechase race but no one ever clears the hedges or ditches. Just a parade of suits and dresses, and what's with those shirt collars!
The shows broken, time to end it, they shoot horses don't they? Was once well scripted, now it's awful. Trite and not believable plots are the new norm. Comic relief is juvenile. Katherine Heigl needs a new wardrobe. Every outfit they pour her into is unflattering. It's time to pull the plug on this show. This series started out as a 10 in season one and has progressively declined. Season 8 has taken this show into the dumps and has joined the generic cheesy TV drama set up by disconnected talentless writers. It's time for this show retire indefinitely. It's such a shame that they took a perfect formula and destroyed it. They should have followed the cardinal rule "if it isn't broke, don't fix it"<br/><br/>Suits will soon join the TV Show graveyard! What a deaster sea8 with Katherine Heigl - no thx - 
hole first episode of sea8 is like this: fighting - arguing, yelling, in a loop - 
it wil go down faster than the titanic -hopefully<br/><br/>wtf: with the middlefinger - yeah what a great nivaou it got with heigl blaah I used to love this show a lot. First two seasons were really brilliant and fun to watch. With the season 3 they started to lose their edge on this matter. It is really getting harder to watch season 4 for me. <br/><br/>Let me be specific why I started to dislike this show. About 7 out of 10 scenes end with somebody yelling at someone or giving them a life lesson with a sassy attitude. So my recipe for this show to turn things upside, they should cut down on drama asap.<br/><br/>Another thing I don't like is about the characters. They played on Louis Litt a lot (because it was easy to sell) and he is really not a part of the show. They should keep him as he was in season 1. Now it seems they can't manage to connect him to the plot well. I prefer a lot of US and Canadian TV shows - they seem to get the right sense of comedy and drama. This is a really cool program with some eye candy for us girls as well - with a little bit there for the blokes too! We came upon this gem by chance and gave it a go,the stories are good and it certainly entertains. Harvey and Mike make a good team and there is definitely chemistry between Mike Ross and Rachel. It gives you a kind of insight into the working life of a lawyer but in a short,fun way. I hope they make a second series and don't cancel like they've done to so many good American/Canadian shows. Better than the boring rubbish we get in the UK. Well done on a good series but think it needs to be advertised over here a bit more cos people are missing out! The foundation of Suits was the friendship between Mike and Harvey. Once Mike is gone, the show lost its spirit. Suits was all about how friends stand for each other, sacrifice everything if they have to along the way regardless of the consequences.<br/><br/>Mike's pro bono cases would warm our hearts and make us remember that not everything is about money and we would side with Mike while he beat the bad guys to get justice for the poor and in need.<br/><br/>Rachel would make Mike remember about ethics and moral code to keep Mike in check. Their relationship would melt our hearts and cause us envy about what they have together as a couple.<br/><br/>I understand that Meghan (Rachel) became a member of Royal family therefore had to quit acting, but the producers should have found a way to keep Mike.<br/><br/>With Mike and Rachel gone, Donna's stupid "I am the smartest" parade became really boring and quite annoying. I'm kind of tired seeing her stupid face every other scene and her sticking her illiterate nose into everything was one of the pet peeves that made me lose interest in this show.<br/><br/>It was cool in the beginning to have a character like Donna that knows someone like Harvey inside out, but once she became know it all it made the character ridiculous and not believable.<br/><br/>Louis does a great job in acting and his comedic performance with Sheila and doctor Lipschtick is the only glue that's holding this show together.<br/><br/>Samanta is a one dimensional cookie cutter character and Kathrene Heigl is definitely a wrong cast. I burst into tears every time I see her 50 pounds head with fully botoxed face walking around like a sheman mimicless.<br/><br/>Show runners should definitely tone down Donna and bring more interesting characters in if they want to save this show. Otherwise, with uninteresting characters like Samanta and Alex, this show will most likely be canceled end of season 8. What A Show! The way that Harvey and Mike play off of each other is really great. These two seem like seasoned co-workers. Louis is def. bad news, so very much looking forward to more. Although I am confused on the facts of Mikes drug dealing and him and Trevors relationship, it does give the show a dark side that keeps you worried, but begging to know more. -Cant Wait to see the rest of the season. -Gabriel Macht plays a great hot shot as well, having only seen him in Behind Enemy Lines as Stackhouse, its a new a different side! Having never seen Patrick Adams before, I have no expectations as to his acting, but his boy-genius wit and quirky charm are definitely great qualities for the show! The best TV show for me, just the best. Thank you Suits .. peace This show is a big hit. I like shows that revolve around lawyers. The plot is super interesting. The casts are super talented! <br/><br/>But renewing for season 8? Was a bad idea. The reason why, because:
1- totally different casts with the same objectives: claiming the name partner.
2- recurrent events.
3- ... the show is NOTHING, without Patrick J. Adams and Gina Torres. <br/><br/>
But overall, hotshot lawyers with amazing plot twists.. What can we ask more? I'm still wallowing the fact that Mike Ross, who is the MC and where the plot most of the series revolved around to, is already not part the show anymore. I still don't get it. If you lose the MC then what result do they expect? I havent watch any episode of this season because it hurts my eyes and heart. After many good seasons the show in season 8 really looks tired Initially Suits were one of the best shows on TV. Right now (S8) its going so bad, its 4/10 at the most. Everyone (Specter, Louis, etc) are behaving as irrational as it gets, like complete morons. Show to replace Mike got Samantha Wheeler - instead of the most likeable character on the show we got easily the most DISLIKEABLE character among the "good guys." I have enjoyed every episode of this series. However, when I read that Katherine Heigl will be joining the cast, my curiosity throws doubt about her credibility judging from past shows that she will be a positive asset. Based on that, I am downgrading my rating. Jumping the gun? Yes, but her Prima Donna attitude has followed her every role. When I started watching these first few episodes, I thought to myself that the show was still trying to find its feet. It happens. But this show did not improve. The writing is mediocre, and I didn't find any character likeable enough to root for because they lacked true personalities.<br/><br/>A protagonist doesn't have to be 'good' to be effective or likeable (see: Bojack Horseman or Better Call Saul), but there has to be some sort of redemptive quality to them.- which, sadly, none of the characters in Suits seem to possess.<br/><br/>I think Meghan Markle did herself a favour in marrying Prince Harry and departing this lost cause. Has anyone else noticed the lack of intimate scenes between Rachel and Mike ever since Meagan Markle became engaged to the future King of England?<br/><br/>A hug and a kiss is as risqué as it got so far this season. Even this episode shows only Rachel in bed, and Mike in the bathroom getting ready for work and leaves with just a kiss to her hand.<br/><br/>One wonders if the royal family has had a talk about appearances with the writers/producers? The concept of the show at the outset was tantalising and very inviting. A dream for anyone who has made a world changing mistake being given a second chance but all the while holding secrets that could destroy it all. The show gathers pace quickly by developing the internal relations with the law firm between the various main characters of; Mike, Harvey, Donna, Jessica, Louis, and Rachel. We learn the characters strengths, flaws, skeletons, and desires. This occurs while following them work high intensity court battles where their quick wits often save the day. <br/><br/>The problems with the show come with the fact that it was never intended to be a masterpiece. It's supposed to be eye catching, fun, and suspenseful. And it was all of things up until the more recent series where the show has devolved into a high budget telenovela. The content consists of shouting & arguments, walking down hallways and arguing, arguing with clients, characters getting irrationally and childishly angry for very petty and loose reasons, and last but not least very incorrect interpretations of the law. <br/><br/>The show was built on a very good idea with little long term strategy. The first three seasons are definitely worth a watch. However, if you're like me you'll only stick with the show through later episodes because you can't be bothered to find another show to watch. SUITS does not carry the genuineness of DEXTER neither does it care about being technically beautiful like Breaking Bad, it doesn't carry the speed of Sherlock nor does it have the tension of Game of Thrones. It is like the Fast and Furious version of TV. It has all the elements of a commercial crowd puller. The beautiful people, the conventional twists and oodles of style.<br/><br/>Everybody here seems to be very strongly connected or how else can you explain the cryptic dialogues that they keep mouthing with the best of figures of speech and yet have the listener decoded in no time (and so many times it's without dialogues too!). The characters are badly etched, or very conventionally drawn. Everybody's got a story to feel sad about and express when the chips are down. Mike is a savant whose co-incidence of getting a job in Pearson Hardman is near to impossible, Harvey has the typical hero quality of being the mysterious successful man that all women desire, Louis and Donna are both slapstick talkers while Rachel is the diva who dresses as if she wanted her hips to be measured with her skirts on. There is no subtlety in the way the plot is brought is on screen, though the politics of the office can get engaging at times and the drama may keep you stuck. But when it screams so loud with clichés, one can't look the other way and like it even when they want to. This has become a farce, pathetic storyline derived by fifth rate actors.<br/><br/>They are all dead and they don't realise it. It used to be very entertaining an intelligent show and now it is a very bad soap opera. Now that Mike Ross is gone so is the show. He was what it was all about. Now every episode is the same, lawyers trying to screw each other. Now Louis Litt is the managing partner. It's no longer salvageable. This is in my opinion one of the most overrated show in a time when TV and Netflix is at its peak. The Main Characters are utterly annoying ,monotonous and way too pretentious. Harvey is an annoying, overrated and a**holic person, Jessica is in simple terms a b*tch, Mike seems likable at first but as the series progresses turns to a shitty character , Rachel is annoying. The only two characters that are likable are Louis and Donna , and the series tries to portray the former as an asshole (fails pathetically , i love that character). The characters preach something and do just the opposite and expect to have the audience's sympathy (fails again). personal advice : If you want to watch a good legal drama with great characters , this is NOT the show , Boston Legal is. I rated 10 until season 7, but 8 lost power without Mike. Also the "name-partner plot" has got a little bit annoying. Why do all the characters in Suits constantly say "god dam" when in a heated discussion? Can the script writers not come up with anything more original for them to say, if no then why not just leave it out all together. #comeupwithbettercursewords Plot lines tend to be a little repetitive and if I hear the word "goddamn" again I may quit watching completely. Other than that it's not too bad. What happened? It used to be such a watchable series; Not this one. I don't know how it's possible to go to the dogs from one season to another other than there was a change of writers, or directors. Complete disappointment! I am a screen addict so if I only watched what I really enjoyed, I would have been done a long time ago. Plus, I knew Suits existed, because everyone was so crazy about it, but I deliberately avoided it, because I suspected it wouldn't be any different from any other lawyer-based show. When I had no other choice, I finally gave in and watched Suits. Boy, was I right about it being no different than so many other shows revolving around law suits. Predictable to the core and what's worse, the law and lawsuits weren't even in the center of it. Or, if they were, they've all been about protecting the firm for 6 seasons. If they weren't about protecting the firm, they were about protecting Mike, who is really unlikable and annoying as hell with his morals and rejecting Harvey and going back to Harvey that same night. I couldn't see one crumb of evidence why this Mike is so special. Usage of his photographic memory was utilized a total of 5 times during 6 seasons. Keep expecting Harvey to admit he's his uncle, since he adores him so much regardless of him being a teenage-equivalent lost boy. which I wouldn't be surprised by if they do it in the next seasons.<br/><br/>"Goddamn" sound familiar. It's all the characters' go-to angry phrase. Keeping/putting hands in pockets looks familiar. If you have the patience to watch again, just pay attention to Mike and Harvey. Donna's know-it-all-and-more character - don't get me started. Hardman's unstoppable come backs, even though he's a changed man.<br/><br/>I've missed so many scenes doing something else and never missing a second. Normally I'd pause a show so I don't miss anything. But missing something here would mean absolutely nothing. I'd go back and see Donna being very smart, Harvey being very arrogant in his own right, Louis being "cute" and Mike being not attractive. <br/><br/>I am actually starting to laugh now. Or vomit a little bit. So I'll just stop reminiscing. Not worth your time and I should have stuck to my principles of not wanting to watch it. Cannot stop watching! super addicted. BEST content, best plot! This is one of my best TV shows I've ever seen.
The scenes that Harvey wins again prosecutors and opposite lawyers are exhilarating. And he and Mike's talking is a humorous. After all, they would make you feel you would want to put on suits. Absolutely must watch TV series. Gets you addicted to each season and each episode from the start. Love the show and the way it reveals every episode with a new taste and emotions. Just gets you so addicted to it wanting to know what happens next. I am still in season 5 and yet I can tell all this. So you have got to watch it. I enjoyed the show at the beginning but then there was too much arguing between the colleagues and not enough focus on actual legal stuff. I mean did they ever seriously work on a case? And they used the word, 'shit' way too much. Out of all the words the English language has to offer couldn't the writers find more descriptive words? This seems to be a major problem in series today especially series that are aimed at the 20 to 30 year old. While the show may be somewhat entertaining it falls short in many aspect and the constant bickering is boring! I thought attorneys were professional and aimed to work together.. Anyhow, probably the older you are the less you will enjoy it because it lacks depth and substance. If you want a review that thoroughly discusses the positive points of Suits, look elsewhere. This is a criticism of what Suits gets wrong.<br/><br/>Suits has a writing problem. The actors do their best with what they're given, but their scripts are flaming garbage. By Season 7, all of the characters are homogeneous. They all speak and act the same way. Worse is the appearance of some tropes that make Suits feel like glorified fanfiction or wish fulfillment.<br/><br/>Let me summarize some of the problems:
<ul><li>The back-and-forth between the two male leads (Harvey and Mike) is formulaic and rarely funny</li><li>Every dedicated, career-oriented attorney at this powerful law firm is a closeted nerd and the characters throw pop culture references around constantly - these constant references are decidedly jarring in-universe and should have been cut, not encouraged, in the writer's room</li><li>The characters just do the same things over and over again. Harvey finds a way to settle, Mike comes up with something using his memory, Donna uses her connections to open doors, Rachel does something normal/lawyery, Louis uses his financial acumen, and Jessica gives cold speeches</li><li>Donna is a MacGuffin who always has connections and abilities that progress the plot in the first 4-5 seasons; she constantly feels like a cheap writer's tool and blessed child up until a character arc where she becomes a one-dimensional "I know people" character</li><li>As a specific example, Season 7 Episode 15 brings out some of the worst writing in the series. A strong-willed young woman, who is demonstrably intelligent and independent, says "I'm just a girl," which runs counter to her character. Men are dominating the writing in the series and it shows. Furthermore, in the episode, one set of characters will be using a heart metaphor and the next scene, containing a completely different set of characters, will use a different heart metaphor. It's like the script was written all in one block, repeating itself with no consideration for context or character motivation</li><li>I personally did not find any of the romantic plotlines to be interesting past about Season 4 and I barely enjoyed the romantic plotlines prior to that point</li><li>Mike is just author insertion by Season 7. If you've ever read Mary Sue/Gary Stu fanfiction where the author is inserting themself, you'll recognize it in Mike. Mike and Harvey are power fantasies</li><li>The characters are just a homogeneous blob by the later seasons. Everyone is quippy, somewhat gritty, and amazing at whatever they do</li><li>Don't even get an actual lawyer started on the legal premises, like walking into the well unannounced, introducing evidence that opposing counsel hasn't seen, etc. This is not accurate legal drama</li></ul><br/><br/>All in all, I would say that Suits is mindless entertainment at best. It can be fun for a bit, but is best enjoyed in extreme moderation (e.g., watch slowly and stop at the end of Season 2 or 3). I do not recommend Suits to the discerning consumer of entertainment. This series has gone from brilliant to completely terrible and has been so for the last 3 seasons atleast. Finish it already.. or atleast readjust ratings so other poor viewers aren't deluded! After watching a hoard of TV shows and awaiting new seasons for a few of them, i stumble upon this show. The ratings and reviews seem good and i decide to give it a go.<br/><br/>But once i started , it was so exciting and well paced that i just could not stop. Completed watching the entire first season in a day.<br/><br/>SCRIPT : Well written,refreshing and at the same time maintains a certain class about it.<br/><br/>ACTING : the leads as well the support have done a good job, with each actor seeming well suited for their characters.<br/><br/>DIALOGUES : Sharp, at times too sharp keeping you hooked.<br/><br/>SCREENPLAY : well balanced, makes even law seem interesting.<br/><br/>OVERALL : A good show if you are looking for something new and interesting with a separate charm about it. Awaiting similarly interesting future episodes and seasons. 9/10<br/><br/>PS : This is my first review and any non conformance should be forgiven.<br/><br/>THANK YOU :) Got to admit, at first I was skeptical to this TV-show. But after the first 6 episodes I love it. The characters are well written, interesting and they all work together really great. The relationship between all the characters is exciting and create a lot of drama. The main character is Mike Ross, great character. Patrick J Adams does a great job. Another main character is Harvey. Yes, just yes... Strong character that in the beginning seems to be an arrogant and smart lawyer, but now seems to be developing into something else.<br/><br/>What this show also does really good is the cases, most are really interesting and exciting. Not to mention the razor sharp dialogs. How this show presents lawyers makes me want to be a lawyer. Cool, smart, successful.. Can't honestly think of anything negative about this show. This show has a lot of potential, I really like it and considering some of my favorite TV-shows is Doctor Who, True Blood and Supernatural shows that this isn't exactly my genre. But I really like it never the less. hmm... writing this 1.25 AM... get to excited to sleep after watching this show :D I liked season 1, it had potential for a great show. By season 2 I'm fed up. Constant backstabbing, predictable and repetitive episodes.
And what the hell is wrong with Mike Ross? What right this cheating fraud, sleeping with best friends girl and married woman, privilege breaking pothead has to talk to anybody about right and wrong?
All the screw ups at work show that this genius is really stupid. Seasons 1-7 were great. The character and conflict that was Mike Ross made the show entertaining to watch. But, after he left, the show lost all its energy. The show tried to throw a Hail Mary by adding Katherine Heigl and some terrible soap opera actor who's character is named Alex. To see how bad of an actor he is, just watch any episode of Game of Thrones then watch him act. Just disappointing how great this series was, and that the producers didn't wrap it after season 7. Instead, they made it so much worse by trying to patch it up with bad acting and bad writing. This started out as a strong concept: man with photographic memory fools everyone into thinking he is a lawyer, gets a job as an associate with a shark mentor, hilarious action ensues. Then they started to use GD like it was a conjunction. We counted 14 times by the lead actor in ONE EPISODE! So offensive to the 85% of America who claims to be Christian. Then they forgot the photographic memory thing for Mike and it became about Jessica being black and Louis Litt having Asperger Social issues and the shark. In the 8th season they got rid of Mike with the photographic memory all together and brought in one of the most hated actresses in Hollywood, the blonde chick that was fired from from GREY'S ANATOMY. That mess is just unwatchable. Too bad, started strong. It's nice to watch a series where the characters actually make you believe they are who they play. Good rapport, timing, interaction...which also means that the writing is good as well.<br/><br/>Hadn't watched this show till I saw the first episode (it's already into the second season) and was delighted. I've always liked Gabriel Macht and he plays his character to the hilt. Not familiar with Patrick J. Adams, but am impressed by his ability to be believable.<br/><br/>The characters are a little bit stereotypical, but it's completely watchable and easy to root for the good guys. I hope the writing stays fresh and this show can be around for a few seasons at least. There are the Oscars and the Emmy's for the best of the best and the gongs for worst. How about we introduce a list that credits the actors that have to keep a straight face and deliver the dribble that this show has led too. The problem here would be a conflict of interests though as both main actors Gabrielle and Patrick are existing producers so probably have that little extra incentive to deliver said dribble. <br/><br/>This show Started off well but soon ran out of gas and lately has resorted to repeating the same formula with different actors, notice I did not say 'characters' but actors. <br/><br/>It has a quirky side in early seasons that are just bearable, at let's say, 5% content and are cute but to stretch this angle with zero plausible plot is taking the mick. <br/><br/>The plot has more holes than I can care to mention and I swear they have even resorted to extending the blank screen between scenes for need to chew up a few more precious seconds of their 45 min time frame. <br/><br/>I did not add a spoiler to this review as I fear they have spoiled it themselves with their terrible story lines and unconvincing casting in later seasons. See ' sociopath ' in season 6 and you'll get my drift. <br/><br/>Sorry guys I use to put up with this as my light and easy drama fill but TV is far too exciting to keep up with this nonsense. This show is so cliché that it actually hurts. I know there are many out there who likes these "goodfeel" happy-ending stories, but I am certainly not among them. The show has some entertainment value while watching it, but when you reflect over what happened a bit after this I was left with one thought: "Wtf?" The story is not credible, and the awkward Mike Ross characters is one the least well characters I've probably ever seen. The dialog between him and the gorgeous Rachel is so fake that no breathing human being can give it credit. Not to mention how predictable it all is. For those who have seen the show "White collar" it's a lot of the same. Every time something goes wrong you can see the solution coming from miles away. The character Harvey Specter is a little bit more likable, but still doesn't impress me. Reminds me of Robert Dawney Jr. in Iron Man. This guy is too cool for himself, and I'm definitely not buying it. I sincerely recommend you find something else to watch. But maybe this is just me. I had so been enjoying this production for the first three seasons. Season four started to deteriorate with the use of the expletive 'shit' so much. Season five is even worse....between so much use of profanity, and yelling at each other constantly, I am definitely losing interest in what had a very good start. <br/><br/>It was fun in the beginning when Mike and Harvey were the only ones who knew... now it's just become ridiculous.<br/><br/>Sorry, but I am signing off Suits with great disappointment! I just don't 'give a sh..' what happens to Mike anymore!<br/><br/>P.S. Donna is the best character on the show. Have you ever seen a truly professional lawyer swagger? Maybe it's different in the New York, but the sight of experienced professionals swinging their hips or constantly unbuttoning and buttoning their suit coats is just hilarious. This kind of behavior would be laughed out of court. The whole point of law is to let your words carry the day, not your swinging arms. The sitcom has become pat and predictable. The characters have not really evolved and the premise has yet to be valid. <br/><br/>Mike, running from a drug deal, who winds up in the lap of senior counsel and starts playing lawyer is just not realistic. Besides, Mikes smarmy, supercilious tone is bravado without stuffing. I stopped watching the series after getting increasingly annoyed with the portrayal of lawyers, whether accurate or not. Lawyers work for their clients, not their personal egos. After a year or two, I tried it again, but nothing improved. The earlier seasons are better. The more recent just try to up the risk factor for more spectacle. I have started watching this TV show three weeks ago. The pilot was not so good. Actually, I thought I should stop watching it. Luckily, there was one specific moment in the pilot convincing me I should give this show a shot (the moment when Harvey dumped the case to Mike even though he should not). Three weeks later, I watched both seasons.<br/><br/>First season was good and I enjoyed it. The second season was 120% awesome....I cant remember last time I saw something nearly as good as this.<br/><br/>I have not seen any movie while watching Suits every night. With the second season in my pocket, I had to return to movies and have seen two movies. So disappointing. This TV show set the bar so high that I am not sure I will see anything else before summer. Cant wait for next season.<br/><br/>Strongly recommend to everyone. Omg it's the best tv show ever I really 1

Fundamental<br/><br/>Dhdgshshsjsbxbxhdndhuxbsjuxbxndksjsgsggzgx The dynamics between the characters just pull this show out from the crowd.<br/><br/>Acting, scripting, pacing... Pretty much perfect.. The characters are relatable and believable yet exciting enough to create an atmosphere of tension when they collide.<br/><br/>Wonderful stuff... Still in the first half of the first season... I am seeing out Harry's wife acting for the first time... I love her character! Well played, Harry, Even though she's just acting, I can see why you fell in love with her! I started Suits 5 years ago and it was an amazing journey through the lives of harvey, mike, donna and luis. The Series focus mostly on their Law Firm, but the scenario is so well written that it makes you instantly care more about each and every of these main characters. I would suggest to everyone searching some new series to watch to give it a go. When I saw Litt walking around the hall in the start of first episode I put the series aside and thought a series which starts with that character...
After a while I had nothing to watch and desperately forced my self to watch it. It changed my life.
If you are a lawyer, a business man, corporate employee, an accountant then all the happenings in this series materializes.
I watched episodes 1 to 5 at least 10 times. Suits is the best thing I have watched in my life. I never really understood how much I loved it until I finished the show. I cried for hours, it moved me. Suits will always have a place in my heart. I will never forget it. This is a fabulous show. I'm on season 8 and the overall quality has not diminished from the brilliant season one. The actors are mostly excellent and yes it is a soap opera but a damn good one at that. It has become more dramatic and slightly less light hearted over time but that's only becuase the characters feelings for each other have deepened. Amazing show i binge watched all episodes and loved it then i got onto season 8 and i got bored because mike wasn't in the show anymore and harvey got too serious i enjoyed their witty banter and movie refrences and now its quite boring. This used to be one of my favourite shows but with the departure of Mike & Rachael the writers seem to have run out of ideas. It seems that all the drama now comes from the lead characters over-reacting to everything and then later apologizing. I would expect otherwise highly intelligent people to not let themselves be ruled entirely by emotion, at least if they want to function successfully. I certainly wouldn't hire any of these unstable hotheads. As much as I enjoy this show it feels as if the writers are rather lazy. All the characters use the same vocabulary. For example they all say "God damn" multiple times per episode. It also seems like the firm is on the brink of extinction multiple times per season.
The writers need to earn their salary and use a bit of originality. Please kill the samantha Character, it is frustrating and chnage thw whole plot I admit I started watching SUITS out of curiosity when Prince Harry and Meghan Markle got engaged, thought I should see how Meghan was. I am now totally engrossed in the series, watching several episodes daily whenever I had the time. Meghan is very good but Gabriel Macht is excellent and Gina Torres is a stunning looking woman and a cool actress. Well written with very clever dialogue. Great ! If you haven't watched SUITS before, this is review contains Spoilers! Yet, it is my intention to review what I perceive to be the overall message of the series. not individual story lines.<br/><br/>What is the message the writers are trying to share with the viewers? Here is my take on two major issues on the television series SUITS:<br/><br/>1) Are most lawyers corrupt and self-serving?<br/><br/>2) Should people desiring to practice law be required to graduate from law school?<br/><br/>Corruption - I have watched this series, up through the beginning of Season 6. A message I have seen repeated over and over again is that almost every lawyer is corrupt. Jessica, Harvey, Louis, Daniel...and their staff, Donna, Rachel.... Even many of the government attorneys are willing to look the other way to serve their own agenda. <br/><br/>Self-serving - The more you watch the show, the more you get the impression that each attorney's personal agenda is more important than respecting the law or helping their client. Instead, they seem more interested in protecting the firm or allies. We see many rivalries taken to extremes, which often hurts the person or client company they are supposed to represent. Why do Harvey and Jessica believe it is more important to win than serve justice?<br/><br/>Law School - Mike, is the one of the man characters in this series. He has a photographic memory and is well-versed in the law, but didn't attend law school (or finish his undergraduate degree). Are we to believe that Harvard Law School isn't that important with regards to practicing law?<br/><br/>Bar Exam - A few states (not New York, where this series is set), allow for people to take the bar exam without graduating from law school. Are the writers of SUITS, trying to make a statement that law school should not be required? In the case of Mike, it appears it wouldn't help.<br/><br/>Overall, the show held my interest for a while. However, when I looked at what I consider to be the agenda of the writers, the constant corruption, negative portrayal of the law, and story lines that are just a bit unrealistic, I gave up by Season 6.<br/><br/>Hats off to some stellar performances but that isn't enough to overcome a plot that seems more interested in painting most lawyers as demons and our justice system as totally corrupt. <br/><br/>Just my opinion. Since I don't get the USA Netflix library, my watch list is limited. I worked for over 25 years in the legal industry. I know one thing for sure. No law firm would survive with all the garbage that goes on in this drama. It's not believable.<br/><br/>It is sometimes entertaining. Not quite, actually not even close to the Good Wife. But it does have its moments. Also, I realize that this firm being based out of NYC, the rules are quite different from California. <br/><br/>The entire premise of the GIANT secret that fuels this show is that one of the attorneys did not attend law school In California this is not illegal if you pass the bar.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, I personally would like to ask the writers to execute/murder Louis Litt. PLEASE, PLEASE! Then they could open another office in Los Angeles and move Mike there.<br/><br/>One more episode: Another attack by a drone blows up only the floors of Pearson, Specter. Or it could be an attack via the ventilation system through poison gas. You could pick and choose which offices to kill off. LOL<br/><br/>Thanks for reading this. I shall not bore you all with the ins and outs of the plots because the acting says it all but what I can say is - AMAZING!!! Patrick J. Adams & Gabriel Macht both give convincing performances and even it were badly written, there characters "bouncing" off one another is incredible. So far I am on Season 2 on Netflix and not once have I thought, "nah, this isn't for me". It's very light on it's feet and does not send the viewer into a state of trance or make you feel your looking into space.<br/><br/>Harvey Specter..."the man who men want to be like and the women who want to sleep with him" - FACT. If there's one thing I can add for viewers help, it is that, if you are watching it on Netflix on your laptop/PC for the first time, you might want to open a tab and learn about what American legal jargon is bounded around in the show - I know what an Escrow account is now :-)<br/><br/>If you're into legal shows that include all aspects of human nature, including compassion, power, arrogance...then Suits is for you. ---Premise--- I love the savvy mentor along side his genius protégé premise. There are also many consistently interesting story lines.<br/><br/>---Characters--- Harvey (the mentor) and Luis play the two veteran attorneys, and they steal the show. The boy genius, Mike (played by Patrick Adams), on the other hand, embodies "TV acting" to the nth degree...<br/><br/>---Patrick Adams (plays Mike, the prodigy)--- As a big consumer of TV and movies, I am hyper-sensitive to the abundant "try-too-hard" acting so common in Television, and Patrick Adams's depiction of the boy genius, Mike, is the epitome of that. His acting is 100% "result oriented" (instead of letting the character's REAL reaction to the circumstances do the talking, Patrick does all of these forced/unnatural things with his lips, tongue, and other faculties to OVER-convey whatever "result" he thinks HIS CHARACTER should be naturally conveying).<br/><br/>---Romantic scenes are HORRIBLE--- I LOVE good, unpredictable, realistic drama and relationships, but the intimate scenes that unfold here are so set-up, simple, and predictable that you see each line of banal dialogue coming a mile away. It is painful to watch. There is CHEAP SET-UP AFTER SET-UP (totally unfounded statements are made just so their counterpart can say or do something "surprisingly" heartfelt in response).<br/><br/>---WEAK and contrived Humor--- The material and delivery are straight out of an 80's sitcom ("He's standing behind me, isn't he?"... Seriously, they use that one!). All the humor is like that - it tries WAAAAY too hard.<br/><br/>From Adams's "result oriented" acting to the shallow spoon-fed romance, and the corny overplayed 80's TV humor, this show tries too hard on the delivery, and not hard enough on the material. ".. then kill yourself." After you reach a certain age, it is fun to watch certain types of shows evolve in front your eyes. Like being Darwin on a remote island, only without the island, the bugs, the lizards, the boat trip, and the lost years.<br/><br/>In the beginning, TV treated lawyers like ... hm .. gods.<br/><br/>Perry Mason with the deep breathing.<br/><br/>The Defenders with EG Marshall, who, with a beard, could have played Moses.<br/><br/>In the 80s we went NextGen with LA Law. Suddenly lawyers were no longer Gods, they were frisky little devils who did what they had to do to advance themselves, and their clients. The family law specialists did not hesitate to sleep with the sobbing wives and the criminal guys did not care if you just murdered Cleveland.<br/><br/>In other words, more like real life.<br/><br/>Was there room for another evolution? SUITS proves there is.<br/><br/>Start with LA Law, drop 15 years from the average age of each character, make everyone so quirky they are as likely to fail an inkblot test as pass it, and sprinkle here and there some dialog so sharp that you might think Sorkin wrote it.<br/><br/>Mix well and sip.<br/><br/>That's SUITS What to write about this TV-Series. The characters are chosen carefully and it pays of. Watching this series is one of the best things you can do during the day.<br/><br/>It's not just a series about a law firm in NYC, it's way more than that. It's about the relations within the firm (business and private) without making it juicy. <br/><br/>One of the hardest things for directors is that the public can relate and emotional bond with the characters. In Suits it happens the whole time. From really hating someone, to being surprised you like them and then back to hating. <br/><br/>Would recommend it to everyone!! This was one of the best episodes so far in my opinion. Finally there is like a lot more connection between characters and even separately. You got this enormous connection between Donna and Rachel, Mike and Harvey, Jessica and Jeff, hell, even Mike and Louis. It is like a whole new story or whole new TV show starting. There is not a lot of comedy involved like in other episodes of this season (I don't know if u guys noticed that too or it is just me), but there is this "side choosing" where we can pick our side and see some "pros and cons" of each character. I hope You guys will like it as much as I did too. Great episode and I just can not wait to see more of this. LOVE IT! SHOW MUST GO ON! :D I finished this series from start to ending! This show is stunning. The scripting is intelligent and well delivered by competent acting. I liked 1-4 seasons and then Season 5&6 are the best of all seasons, super interesting and lot of twists, every episode is so curious to find out what's next.
The last season is the worst of Suits. There's no interesting scenes at all full of nonsense drama.
For me, Season 5 and 6 are Awesome Suits, the series, which in a bigoted manner only casted jewish actors and actress, sure used to be entertaining once, and maybe even for a couple of seasons. But it definitely isn't anymore. It's turned into a long events of the same boring soap opera its main protagonist criticized in its early seasons. Description:
"On the run from a drug deal gone bad, Mike Ross, a brilliant college dropout, finds himself a job working with Harvey Specter, one of New York City's best lawyers"
===Spoilers follow===
Season 9 is current
Is this really still an accurate summary? Mike stopped smoking pot in what, season 4? Mike was written off the show in season 7!
The only accurate phrase of the description is 'Harvey Specter, one of New York City's best lawyers" and it really doesn't describe the show even remotely well (or the character in my opinion)<br/><br/>Maybe when you can't negotiate with title character actors behind closed doors, you're producing the show wrong and should stop screwing the talent.
This show most likely will not survive season 9, as now Jessica has also left the series and we have a handful of new actors to try and fill the gaps who are spreading themselves so thin all character on the series they play are basically one person, reflecting a general lack of talent.
Please cancel this series. It's a rather whitewashed cast anyway, and I'm conservative so you won't see me saying that too often. I just don't like the way this show has been written since ... well season 4, when Mike quit pot, and the show was no longer what the imdb page described it as. Harvey spectre has got it all. Looks, money and the alpha male of New York. Unfortunately he has a little sidekick who spoilt the series in a way. Every scene with mike and Rachel is boring and repeated.<br/><br/>LEWIS LITT should have had more air time as every scene with him has your belly in cramps. I've now watched every currently available episode at least twice, from the pilot through to season 8, episode 10, and this show just keeps getting better and better. And that's an amazing thing considering that it got off to a flawless start! Unusually for a long-running TV show, there isn't a single bad episode. There are one or two that may be a little overburdened by flashbacks, but I'm nit-picking to even mention it, as they're still great episodes. It really is a very classy show.<br/><br/>Part of its success is that aside from the excellent foundations of strong, intelligent, witty writing; compelling narrative; well-drawn three-dimensional characters; and masterful direction; it also has the courage to evolve beyond the original limitations set out by the pilot. What started as a fun, light-hearted, witty show about a slick, arrogant lawyer and his fraudulent but genius sidekick has grown steadily into a dark and intense study of human strength and frailty, and the swirling miasma of conflicting emotions and behaviours that are born out of damaged psyches. And yet it never gets too heavy. It still manages to maintain a perfect balance of intense drama, witty banter, occasional absurdist moments, and an ongoing narrative arc about the ups and downs of a top-level legal firm and the cases they work.<br/><br/>There really isn't much that could be improved upon with "Suits". The show is so substantial and rests upon such solid foundations that it easily survived losing three main cast members in season seven, and has come back just as strong in season eight. Long may it continue. It was awesome the first few seasons. Then the last 3 made me feel like I had short term memory LOS as story lines were being used repeatedly in different scenes. Then the basic storyline began repeating. Let the show move on into the sunset..... When I started watching the series, I enjoyed the tv show a lot together with my family.
But the last season without Meghan and Patrick was seriously bad to watch with so many repeated reactions and endings which all seemed so predictably familiar as if the writers ran out of ideas.
As someone who work in the legal sector, I find Suits has become absurd and seem to be encouraging corruption by repeating to everyone to stay calm as we are a family and must believed in the philosophy no matter what. It does not reflect reality at all. In fact it seemed to have lost its original sparkle with its incessant politically correct scripts rammed down. Suits is a must see as it's been able to maintain interesting plots even after Mike's secret discovery through all the first 7 seasons. However season 8 is a major let-down for me. So far (episode 8 or 9 I think) there's absolutely no main plot, only subplots that nobody cares about in order to develop characters like Louis, Sheila, Samantha, Alex...to make up for Megan and Patrick departing from the show. It definitely feels like the season 8 is going nowhere despite trying to make us believe the opposite. Only Harvey, Donna and Louis remain from the original winning team and let's be honest, it is not the same without Mike and Rachel. I still give it a 10 because the previous seasons were really great and entertaining but the show should have stopped at season 7 when Patrick and Megan were still part of it, at least you could have made a good end. I am a big fan of Suits, but unfortunately since the departure of Patrick Adams and Meghan Markle the scripts have gone downhill at a rapid pace.
It's now just another humdrum show about legal eagles fighting. Meghan and Patric just screw this amazing serie... Is there any chance to bring them back? Episodes from season 8 are really hard to watch. Unfortunally, Harvey's speech and character is the only reason to still watch the show. Seriously I don't miss Megan's Char a BIT! Not a TINY BIT! But Patrick char I miss it a lot! The bromance was everything in this series. The teamwork etc. But without mike it is not going to work for to long!! <br/><br/>Bring him back fast! DO SOMETHING FFS! Bring back Patrick/MIKE! From terrible acting, to unconvincing stories, to lines so embarrassingly lame that I cringe at hearing them, to aimless plots, there is absolutely nothing even tolerable about this insult to intelligence, taste and acting. One of the leads is supposed to be a hardcore, emotionless lawyer but comes across as a brat in daddy's clothes; another is supposed to be a savant punk but comes across as a chess club nerd; the styling is a poor man's copy of Mad Men, only all wrong; the female roles are filled with faceless, characterless clones who all behave exactly the same. The shameless audacity of comparing the two male aspiring L.A.waiters to Clooney and Damon (when in reality those were Clooney and Pitt, just to show what idiots work on Suits) is one of the funniest ads on TV, though. Watching an episode will lower your IQ by 5 points; avoid at any cost. How did this show end up with such a high rating? I started watching Suits because of the hype and the high ratings but after watching the first two episodes I honestly do not understand what the hype is about. I have watched The Good Wife before and I absolutely loved that series. I decided to give Suits a shot after finishing The Good Wife but it was a complete waste of my time. This series is absolute garbage. No other legal drama will ever be able to top The Good Wife but this doesn't even come close. It doesn't deserve an 8.6 rating. The main character (Harvey) is narcissistic, arrogant and annoying. The storyline is unrealistic. Why would a top legal firm hire someone without a law degree? Do not waste your time on this show. The two leads share an enjoyable chemistry. Supporting cast is passable with Hoffman being a stereotype.<br/><br/>Slick and fast paced but rings hollow on subject matter.<br/><br/>TV characters lead a charmed life but the ease and clockwork regularity with which these guys find a perfect solution to rather challenging problems strains the credulity a viewer must necessarily bring to the table nowadays to enjoy any sort of filmed entertainment.<br/><br/>Fear for the longevity of this show. The bad guy is already wearing thin and constantly finding things by reading stuff that others failed to read already feels far-fetched. And if all else fails, make stuff up ? Please. <br/><br/>As another review pointed out the writing needs a fundamental improvement. All the snappiness will only distract for so long before the nagging empty feeling becomes too much to ignore.<br/><br/>Doomsaying aside, have enjoyed it so far and wish them the very best with their work. <br/><br/>Thank you.<br/><br/>Has improved. Personal melodrama still feels decidedly contrived but professional drama is moving away from ooh I read it/oh I lied. That assistant needs to tone down her facial expressions a bit, she's on camera not on stage but she can be really funny and look forward to seeing more of her. Still hooked.<br/><br/>Second season going strong. The assistant really hit her stride which made 'it' all the more shocking. Hoffman and Torres are also better. Stories are still uneven but decidedly better. Lame romance has rightly been back burnered. The personal relationships between the diverse characters are far more interesting than any 'will they, wont they' rubbish. They really wasted an opportunity on the initial firing situation. Harvey should have been ready to fire Mike. Mike should then have engineered an out and then there would have been some real tension from an uneasy alliance. Instead Harvey goes from shark to poodle on commnand. The writers should stop this childish habit of saving his utter ruthlessness only for the lesser characters. He and Mike should have been allowed to turn on each other a little. It's been a long time since I had watched a show about lawyers. I watched Ally Mcbeal and Drop Dead Diva and both are brilliant shows. This one...ugh...I stop at the middle of the third episode of season 1. Every stereotype portrayed about lawyers is all there; they're cocky, cold-hearted, money-driven, deceitful slimeballs. Even the staff who are not licensed lawyers in the firm have massive egotistic attitude. Literally, NO ONE is likable. It's also hard to focus on the cases, because those legal terms said by the characters without explanation are hard to keep up unless you're in the law business. Not sure why it gets such high ratings, as if most people can actually understand the content, which I find unbelievable. I watched a few episodes of "Suits" hoping that the one huge, glaring problem would be addressed in some semi-logical way.<br/><br/>We all know what the problem is, right? No spoilers here.<br/><br/>You've read a few reviews, so you know Harvey, who has just been made a Senior Partner in a New York law firm, is sent on a headhunting trip to hire a new law associate from amongst the graduating class of Harvard Law School. But, he is bored, oh, so bored. He instructs Donna, his executive assistant, to "pre-interview" the candidates in the hopes of finding one with wit, who thinks fast, who stands out from the herd.<br/><br/>Donna succeeds magnificently. Only her find isn't witty; Mike is being pursued by the cops because he has a briefcase full of pot. Which he proceeds to spill and fumble about with in front of Harvey.<br/><br/>Here is where I have a hard time: After an unbelievably short period of reflection, Harvey decides to put himself in extreme danger of disbarment and prison time, his firm in the most dire professional liability and danger of fraud charges, every other partner and employee of his firm in professional jeopardy for the rest of their career, and every client of his firm in legal limbo. All because he is bored.<br/><br/>Harvey actually hires Mike. Who has no degree. As legal associate. That means "lawyer".<br/><br/>I waited a few episodes for him to come to his senses and send Mike to law school. But no one in his right mind would do what Harvey and Mike are doing. It is a recipe for disaster. SUITS is a lawyer show. Set in New York (captured, by the way, in beautiful cinematic vistas) it focuses on a very successful law firm, managed by Jessica Pearson (Gina Torres) who balances the talents of her two top lawyers, the smarmy Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman) who is a control freak, and the very brilliant but egotistical Harvey Spector (Gabriel Macht). There is a particularly appealing and very bright secretary Donna (Sarah Rafferty) and a beautiful paralegal Rachel (Meghan Markel) and last but certainly not least by any means there is Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams) - a young lad who is extremely bright, has a photographic memory, dropped out of college because he took tests for fellow students and got caught, fell into marketing drugs by default for need of money so that he could pursue his dream of being a lawyer, and falls quite by accident into the role of being selected as associate to the brilliant but self absorbed Harvey Spector. This is the team of characters who are destined to provide fascinating sub stories as they interact. Let me start off with the bottom line: I enjoyed the first couple of episodes and intend to stick around for more, on the hope that the good will be retained and the bad ironed out.<br/><br/>Having said that, it doesn't feel to me like any originality or creativity played a part in the creation of this series. One can almost hear the executives deciding on it: "People like 'House'. We want something like 'House'. But we can't do it as a medical show and we certainly can't do it as a cop show. Any other ideas?" "How about as a lawyer show? We'll have a brilliant civil-law closer take Hugh Laurie's role, and we'll find someone like Masters to play second fiddle." "We can't just copy the character of Masters. It needs to be made larger, taken to extremes. How about a Will Hunting type?" "Yeah, great, and let's throw in a dash of Mentalist into the mix and we have ourselves a show!" etc.<br/><br/>It's formula. It's formula beginning to end. The thing is, like store-bought cake, even though formula will never be sublime, it can, when ingredients are applied discriminatingly, be quite palatable and even enjoyable.<br/><br/>HOWEVER: Though the lead actors are all doing a fine job, in the pilot the smaller parts (particularly the client and witness) are horribly acted. The character of Louis is a caricature and just doesn't work for me. It makes the whole story lose believability. The script overflows with House-like snappy comebacks that are fun to watch, but these do not cover up the basic facts that: a. The dramatic situations are contrived and the legalese is completely unrealistic. b. The script is awfully repetitive. I find it appalling that even after just two episodes the writers are so low on ideas. c. The "Eureka!" moment came about half an hour after I figured it out on my own. d. Some of the dialogue is just so fake and clichÃ© I found it grating and painful.<br/><br/>So, really, now it's just a question of whether the series will be able to outgrow its growing pains and mature into something better than formula. The good actors are there (including Gabriel Macht in the lead, sporting a hauntingly young-Sean-Connery-like appearance). The good premise is there. The fun-to-watch back-and-forth is there. The twists are there. The classy-looking locations are there. The engaging music is there.<br/><br/>Now, all that's missing is a few good writers. Absolutely necessary qualifications: 1. Caring about the subject matter. 2. Ability to write natural-sounding dialogue, when snappiness isn't the objective. 3. Original ideas. 4. Basic knowledge of how civil law works.<br/><br/>I wish this show all the best. I really want it to succeed. There is so little to watch on TV these days that is worth opening the telly for. Here, if nothing else, there is potential. A lot of people suggested me to watch this show, but i was not interested as i thought it would be the typical lawyer TV show, one boring night i decided to give it a shot and turns out i was wrong. Its very entertaining, funny, witty with intelligence that makes you want to see what happens next. I was shocked at its low ratings, I love the actors and they're acting very well, the direction is pretty good and the plot is very different. I guess people are just put off by the typical lawyer shows, which have become too common. Please give this show a try, its a must watch series! :) I'm totally hooked to it, can't wait for the next season. The series was great for the first 4 seasons but then from the 5th its just became really bad mike character is just what!!! And they lost the appeal for it When this show started it was one of the best in tv.
Up to series 6/7 it was must see television.<br/><br/>But after that it faded - and fast.<br/><br/>The final series was little more than a joke. A parody of what it used to be.<br/><br/>Hackneyed, simplistic dialogue linking episodic scenes with little or not plot. Just a series of individual sketches.<br/><br/>The acting was reminiscent of the worst of "Little House On The Prairie", but without the charm.<br/><br/>A terrible decline into the abyss of poor tv. This is an interesting and fast moving show. I'm struggling to get through season 7. In at least every episode every character uses 'god dam' in every other sentence. It incredibly over used. What are the writers thinking. If it was just one person it would be believable but each and every characters says it. I'm rolling my eyes - 4 god damns in the past 4 minutes. Ugh. I see that there is going to be a ninth season, why?<br/><br/>It was on it's knees in season 7, the only believable character was Mike Ross, his departure should have indicated to the production team that it's time was up.<br/><br/>I just watched season 8 episode 11 and it was so bland that I have forgotten it already. As something to watch because you're bored or nothing else is on TV, then tune in. I've worked in the legal industry in New York for 25 years and the presentation and relationships are laughable.<br/><br/>I tuned in at Season 4, so maybe it started out better, but . . .<br/><br/>1. Paralegals going to law school at night DO NOT get 300 sq.ft. windowed offices. They're lucky not to get assigned a stall in the bathroom.<br/><br/>2. A lawyer's office with a few papers neatly styled on his/her desks? FUNNY! Try not tripping over files, papers, boxes, etc. Mine fields are easier to navigate.<br/><br/>3. A client going directly to a paralegal/law school student to work on a case is ridiculous. She's not licensed to practice law and a conflict check must be conducted first.<br/><br/>4. Hot and sexy secretarial assistants that wear design clothing? In most cases, stretchy, gardening clothing is more like it.<br/><br/>I can go on, but - well, you get the picture. Suits is the best show on TV. The acting is superior in quality and the writing is beyond anything we have had to subject ourselves to over the course of this last prime time fall/winter season! Unless you count The Good Wife which is about an 8 out of 10. I would count SMASH, but the only reason I tune in to this new show is because I love the music, not necessarily the writing or the plot. I would give SMASH a 7.5. I loved Pan AM but again, once you like a show, it gets snuffed out before they give it a chance. <br/><br/>I can't believe we have to wait till July to tune in! This show has it all, comedy, drama and great characters. I hate to get hooked on a show because once I am hooked, the shows get canceled! If they cancel this show anytime soon, I will boycott Hollywood!! What do you think? i've always loved Gabriel Macht since "because i said so" i thought that he's charming, and has a lot of charisma, but i've never seen this coming.<br/><br/>the great thing about this show is that every character manages to stay unique and is brilliantly cast, that we actually believe it's not them it's the character. this show is incredibly well written, i love all the lines, and unlike any other show you may not have a favorite character, you can relate to each one of them and they all tend to be fascinating. Harvey is "the Dream", Mike is an attaching "Will Hunting" who takes his smart as it is and tries to make something out of it ( thanks robin williams) , Donna is a gorgeous bitch, Louis has major self-esteem issues , Jessica is the mom, Rachel i hope will be the one Mike is gotta see about...<br/><br/>Enough said about the characters. Lately, the best surprise i've had is "The good wife", as i love brilliant law TV shows. i wouldn't say that the good wife is better than Suits as they both have the same ingredients, great plot, both are witty, amazingly written, unique characters but for those who wants an extra-dose of humor and fun, suits has it... Suits has it all.<br/><br/>this is my first review, because i was truly surprised by this Gem, i hope they'll have a lot of seasons coming and many awards as they deserve it. Unlike many other shows that I watch, I have to remain 100% alert to keep up with the dialogue in this show. <br/><br/>You are basically watching people bickering with the utmost intensity and rigour for 45 minutes straight. At the end of it, you are physically pulled closer to the screen from trying to catch every word. It's so sarcastic, so witty, and so much fun! <br/><br/>This is a great show--especially for people looking for motivation while studying for their LSATs this summer.<br/><br/>I enjoy the accurate use of lawyer lingo, giving it some educational value as well. Each episode unfolds with a new case, which ultimately strengthens our understanding of characters and their dynamics in relation to each other. <br/><br/>However, I am entirely split on the ethics of Mike's situation. An objective viewer would be torn between their love of Mike's character and their sense of right and wrong. <br/><br/>Overall, a thought-provoking, entertaining, gripping show that MUST be watched at least once! Suits: Men and women dressed in tailored fitted clothing and doing that single jacket button up when they want to signal that they are being serious or dramatic. Not a crime show, not about doctors, not a comedy and not reality TV - it's better! (Australian networks may not like it since it doesn't fit into any of these four boxes, which is a bummer). 10 stars says it all. However, to add: Very well written script which is in turn spoken and acted out by talented actors. Story line, although can't be viewed as totally realistic, is very entertaining and has been developed with a lot of room to grow.<br/><br/>Final tidbit at the end since it may turn some readers away from the show; it's about lawyers, not crime. If you ask me there are too many crime shows now. NCIS is the only one crime show that I think deserves merit, and if you like the witty remarks and interesting plots of NCIS, then you will like Suits. But I stress, Suits is not about crime, it's about the well written people, their interesting stories and being a suit (or becoming one). Suits is a must watch programme, It's not like any other garbage programme on T.V that are all the same I'm not going to name them out yous already know what programme's I'm talking about. I waited ages to start watching this series when it first came out i said to myself not my kind of T.V show and i finally watched the first episode and thought it was brilliant, two lads Harvey one the best lawyers around and Mike his protégé each one of them extremely smart and good at what they do, they try to act like boss and employee but they're more than that they're friends but neither one of them will admit it.<br/><br/>Now I'm not going to tell you's everything about the workplace relationship and friendship relationships between both characters find out the rest for yourselves and I guarantee you'l love this programme as much as me its hard not too. The true feelings and the heart warming friendships that you built between yourselves in these years became so visible and the reason why this was so much more than just a series.<br/><br/>Thank you for the memories and the positive energy. Thank you for the small lessons you taught us, the real-life atmosphere, and the constant analogy to the modern workplace. Thank you for the inspiration and support for friendship, love, family, and trust. Thank you for the words Harvey said at the end, that will follow me from now on.<br/><br/>Congratulations to the cast, the writers, the producers, everyone who played a part and contributed to the amazing result.<br/><br/>All the best! The first season was fun but since then it's been a slow roll down hill. It's even more frustrating because even in the current season the cast continues to be top notch. The writing is consistently lazy and worse than formulaic. It's had a good run but unless the show runner is going to spend some cash on real writers and a legal consultant it's time to end this one. Honestly, this was my favorite show at the beginning and I was waiting for every new episode. Sadly after season 3 it started becoming extremely dull but I continued since I was already invested in the story. Now at season 8 it is just unbearable. I just finished episode 6 and I am not watching episode 7.. ever. The show turned into a cheesy drama. Every scene starts calm and escalates into an argument, using 'god d**n' or 'bull****', within a matter of seconds. Then the scene ends and another scene like the one before starts all over again. The acting became extremely dull and predictable, even the actors that played great in the beginning are bad right now. It is full of cheesy cliches and I am pretty sure non of the law is 'correct'. 
Sad, just sad. I cannot understand how it got emmy nominations, or even on TV- Is everyone this stupid- beside being a fantasy- it's a fantasy that is supposed to be realistic or possible. I am not calling this a spoiler bec I am discussing the basic concept- from the 1st. The whole premise is impossible- Even if the premise weren't as riduclous as it is- the few scens I watched later ,jsut to see how it was still on were horrible! characters and dialogue. I watched part of the 1st episode and gave up. A top New York law firm who only hires Harvard grads hires someone who never went to law school. because he has a didactic memory and has all the law books memorized. which by the way doesn't mean he has any conceptual understanding. It goes on from there-
It would be more realistic if Aliens from Dr. Who or Insect men from MIB wearing human skin suits were practicing law in a top law firm.
I tuned in a few times just to see, and the whole dialogue and scenes were unbearably stupid, and very day time soap opera., but not as good.
If the law firm knowingly or unknowingly hired a non lawyer to act as a lawyer- they would be sued from here to the moon, and ruined. and every case they litigated would have to be retried and all their clients would be suing. Everyone would lose their law license, If not actually jailed which is also likely. so this secret goes from the one hiring partner, to secy to another partner. IMPOSSIBLE. and stupid beyond words. How can such a stupid ignorant concept be carried. How can they not be called out. there is a lot more wrong with this. It makes me fear for TV and humanity. Suits is a show that neither my husband nor I want to miss each week...as a seasoned law show addict, I can usually practically predict what the characters are going to say next...not so in this drama...love the writing, character development, and twists in the plots...great ensemble acting...I think Patrick J. Adams has really developed as an actor since last year...He has added more depth to his character...and grandma...she's always been one of my favorites...Loved her on Wings. I think she is an underrated actress, not seen often enough on TV. Last, but not least, the score is great...the music invites you in, grabs you, and helps to seamlessly connect the scenes without distraction or overkill...Hope this first-rate program continues to excel...no such thing as too many intelligent and stimulating adult dramas on TV! I love Suits!! This is the few law TV drama that I would love to watch!! I personally prefer medical drama. All those characters are so interesting! Especially Donna, she's super funny!!I can stop laughing every time I watch her interact with Louis. I just looking forward to see how Louis will embarrassed himself in every episode. I really hope I can see more interaction between she and Louis in Season two. I don't know if I am the only one feels that, but I really feel like there is something between Mike and Harvey!!They filtering with each other in every episode!! I beg the scriptwriter wrote these ambiguous scene on purpose! This show is intelligent and sassy. It has a fresh, interesting premise. So nice to see new story lines...with the promise of continued innovation! Just the right blend of drama, intrigue, and comedy.<br/><br/>Love the New York setting....and how awesome is that theme song?<br/><br/>The casting is perfect; acting superb. So impressed by the character development and the evident chemistry. I'm intrigued by the methods they use to show off the eidetic memory of Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams) and how his exceptional intelligence is mixed with naivety. They make you love and admire the so very egotistical and brilliant Harvey Spector (Gabriel Macht). The lovely, crafty and impressive secretary, Donna (Sarah Rafferty), is a woman any woman would want to beunless instead you aspire to be the strong, intelligent, and beautiful founding partner of Pearson Hardman, Jessica Pearson (Gina Torres). Then there is the equally intelligent and beautiful, yet soft (in a good way) paralegal Rachel Zane (Meghan Markle). Heck, I even developed a soft spot for Harvey's rival, the oily junior partner Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman).<br/><br/>I looked forward to this each week during the summer; can't wait for next summer. This show is great from the get-go. With a unique plot, 3 dimensional characters (including the female characters, which one reviewer failed to notice... I believe he's confusing this show with 'Franklin and Bash', which is a 2-D cartoon compared to 'Suits'.) and clever episodes, I think this show has a bright future. <br/><br/>After the pilot, the first few episodes felt a little repetitive, using the same episode plow over and over again (new associate makes a mistake and spends the rest of the episode cleaning up for himself and trying to set things right). But, the writers broke their mold and the show only got better as the season went on, along with the development of deep characters and relationships. <br/><br/>I'd gladly recommend this show, especially to anyone with a lawyer in the family (my mom and her brother are both attorneys). Can't wait for a second season. I just have to say how much I enjoy this new show on USA! Cheers to USA for picking this gem up and to the entire cast and crew, clever writers and of course to the creator. The pace of the show and scenes are seamless. The set of the firm is crisp, clear and open. I feel like this show keeps getting better and better with each new episode. What great chemistry all of the actors have! I hope this show continues to captivate us all because it is truly a keeper. I believe with these writers and the building of the relationships between the characters there is no limit to keep creating such entertaining episodes. Another great show USA, thank you! saw two episodes of this and didn't care for it at all , a show like weeds , dexter , ray Donovan , boardwalk empire, prison break or the following at the end of every episode at least there was something to come back to. Characters you can relate to and cliffhangers this show it didn't do much for me. I'm not one of those people who only watch say action movies or sitcoms either I'll give everything a chance.<br/><br/>The episodes drag on to the point where I multi tasked and played guitar it was as boring as the first 4 episodes of Hannibal which for whatever reason people are going nuts for. Seriously save yourself the time , this show looks good on paper ...but... it isn't , I can't take the genius kid seriously this should have been some B listed movie and that's it.<br/><br/>just see the movie Limitless instead the one about the pills that make the guy use 100% of his brain it's a similar concept but more believable concept. If there should be anything on TV it should be a show about assassins or something , this show tried to be original but it failed miserable in my eyes. Perhaps it's the writing , who cares. If you can sit through this check out the house of lies. WARNING: THIS SHOW IS VERY ADDICTIVE.<br/><br/>Without further ado, let's present Harvey Specter. One of New York's best closers and a senior partner at Pearson Hardman. He needs to pick out a new associate, a Harvard graduate, and eventually teams up with Mike Ross. These two form a great duo and this show will go case by case basis but in every episode you will see and learn more about the characters.<br/><br/>They are all brilliant in their roles and this show will bring you tonnes and tonnes of great quality Quotes. This is a show that YOU-MUST-SEE if you are in the corporate business world working with similar jobs. You will learn a lot from it and while it is good it is also very, very, addictive. I wish it never ended! It has saved me during quarantine!! I wish this show would start back up its hands down the best show ever next to friends!! Well, I am not a native of United States so I have to google (read internet search :P) a lot of things .. right from 'subpoena' to what not .. he he
And I am sometimes still assuming of what is actually happening in there. Assuming. Yes.<br/><br/>May be it is the lingo or may be I am not the only one, but one thing is for sure; this TV series is extremely enjoyable.
I am hooked. Hooked on this from the first episode, Harvey Spektor, Louis Litt, Donna, Mike Ross,......what will we do without you now......maybe a movie? Just watched the finale of this fantastic series and it felt like I was losing a family member ! It was one of the best things i have ever watched and i looked forward so much to each and every new episode. Thankyou to the Suits team for such a masterpiece ! Any chance you could come back ???? Love the show but please stop using damn after God! This my first ever review oN imdb. thats after watching scores and scores of series movies, animes( for those who dont count them as series).I just check the rating and this show (no pretentious piece of crap) has the most wrong rating. its more than my all time favourites like the leftovers ,community etc.
Dialogues are so lame. you may like the characters in first season but after that they only go downhill and start becoming pretentiuos and cliched.
i stopped watching midway in season 3 ( I like complete ending but i dont think i will i eveeerrr return back so such lacklustre show.
i have given 5 ( which is waayyy more than it ACTUALLY deserves) because of descent 1st season and good cinematography.
PLEASE DONT LET THE AMERICAN TV STANDARD SINK ANY FURHTHER. After watching the first episode I was like what will happen next. Then I wanted to become a lawyer do the shady stuff, kick other lawyers ass. Gabriel Macht, Rick Hoffman and Patrick J. Adams are the best. If you are into law stuff it is the best TV show for you. It also includes all aspects of human nature like emotions and stuff. Suits is best drama and comedy series I've ever seen. Must watch suits is the best. The show was pretty nice in the beginning. It was witty, and most importantly the first episode was lengthy. It had time to progress through a story.<br/><br/>The show quickly drops off in quality when they episodes become shorter. Every actor noticeably talks at breakneck speed without allowing space between lines. Conversations are so forced and unrealistic that it seems stupid. There is no room for them to breathe. <br/><br/>There are exceptions to this. Sometimes there are scenes where the pacing is more normal, but in the majority I notice unrealistically sped up pacing that leaves the plot weak. There is no time to connect. The story just breezes by you as fast as it possibly can, which is not how law and storytelling should work. The show has a good structure, strong characters and compelling cases but I find the Mike Ross character extremely frustrating. I would expect, since it's a leading character, that it would bring more to the story than just some failed romances, eidetic memory (that he doesn't really use smartly anyway) and a childish attitude. He screws up a lot and the answer pretty much falls in his slap by listening someone talking about some random thing not related to the case in hand. Mike Ross may have an eidetic memory but he is NOT good lawyer material (or adult material, for that matter), I do not find believable that he would get so much attention from someone like Harvey Specter or Jessica Pearson. Also, the Rachel character is confusing, too emotional, annoyingly self righteous and too much of a distraction without bringing anything to the show. So for that i give it a 7, instead of a 9. This is the best one can get not only LAWYERS can watch it anybody who has a love for the best drama is going to love it.<br/><br/>Yes, just give it time watch it and then there will be a time you can't just wait you can't stop and you need to watch more and more.<br/><br/>You even can watch these episodes 5-6 times continuously and even after that you will love it.<br/><br/>The Writers have written the duologue's of a lifetime it is very tough to write these dialogue's these days that will settle in the Heart of the people.<br/><br/>The Actors even performed it brilliantly.<br/><br/>THANK YOU,,,for bringing such a show...Please watch it on TV and increase viewer-ship that this show never sets. Well I used to think that Prison Break is the greatest shows of all ... and now as I have watched almost every high-rated show except those fantasy crappy genre ones , I want to admit that my stand on the best show has changed ...<br/><br/>**Spoilers Alert** Now who could have thought of changing a partnership firm to a LLC and thus creating a modification in the bylaws of the company just to buzz off a preferred stockholder's threaten that would have made company pay 60% dividend instead of initial 30% agreement. ** / **<br/><br/>Now this was a major one , but reminiscing all the incidents that I have witnessed before , I would say that Suits is the best show I have ever watched... Bow down to Aaron Korsh and his writers ... and as everyone who watches it already know -- the cast is best in the business... It's highly addictive, I got completely into it since the beginning. It is well written and fast-paced. Each and every character is charismatic, smart and complex with a little something that makes him special. <br/><br/>It takes place in a corporate law firm so sometimes it gets hard to understand fully every case but that doesn't matter. What does are the main characters and their interaction between each other.<br/><br/>Harvey is smart, sharp and sassy. He has style even in the few moments he's not in a suit. Even if he's a egotistic yuppie, it's obvious he's got a carapace and actually, he is ready to fight for the people he care for. Mike is touching,sensitive and makes me laugh with his references and quotes from movies. Donna is stunning, dashing (No one says dashing... James bond says dashing !) and has an unquestionable authority. Although she's at the bottom of the ladder in the firm. Her cleverness and her efficiency up-scales her position ten times. Rachel has a great chemistry with Mike and is very classy. Jessica is very credible as the captain of the ship, ruthless. And last but not least, Louis is as funny as he's smarmy, merciless control freak who wants to cover the insecurity that his rivalry with Harvey drive. He's a supporting role thought he's essential to the show. Sometimes even scene stealer.<br/><br/>I hope it will last many years. Suits is the story of a young man who has a lot of troubles (especially with drugs) who lands in the world of lawyers together with master 'closer' Harvey specter. Together they try to close or win the the cases of the clients of the firm. But apart from the lawyer cases they get caught up in intriguing business power games.<br/><br/>I love this show a lot because it let's you take a look in the world of the biggest lawyer firms in the world. Especially the way Harvey Spector and Mike Ross interact with each other in the series intrigues me. This is one of the best leading roll duo's I have ever seen.<br/><br/>This show who work great for people who love shows like: House, Arrow, Game of Thrones The shows that people love to watch relaxed but with still some intrigue. One of the best TV series I have ever seen. The argument is excellent and the personages are very well characterized.<br/><br/>Sometimes it is a little bit exaggerated but it is a TV Show (is common to all). I highly recommend this TV series especially if you like law, management, planning and strategy!<br/><br/>On the first season you will find a construction of trust between the two main actors. On the second season you will found a high complementary work between the "teacher" and the "student". You will get plenty of real world scenarios on both seasons that you can transpose to your day-today living and see that being honest and fair, most of the times, is the right choice Love this show! It is fun, has good characters, and is more interesting and sharper than other courtroom drama shows. I hope it continues long into the future. I'm not sure why I have to write 10 lines to do a review of this show, as I think a concise opinion is just as useful! However, I will continue to type until they tell me I have met the guidelines. But seriously, give this show a try and make sure you find Episode 1 which will help make sense of the rest of the series. I was able to find Suits on iTunes but not yet on Netflix, but it happened also to be on TV this weekend on Bravo from Episode 1 on through to the latest one. I am sad to read that it only has been committed to 11 shows but hopefully with these good reviews it will continue. It is funny and well written. First episode was great. But then it all got very the same every episode.. and also -- i think a lot of things in suits and gossip girl is a like - all the conflict, the constant view of newyork-skyline, expensive clothing and people who think being sassy means you can conquer the world. I have only seen the two first seasons of them both but... nah. I had higher hopes for this show Show's description reads: 'On the run from a drug deal gone bad, Mike Ross, a brilliant college-dropout, finds himself a job working with Harvey Specter, one of New York City's best lawyers.' The 'brilliant college-dropout' pill is hard to swallow. No guy in their right mind would leave a college education because it was not financially viable, especially in this day and age where so many people are willing to help. This is not how people work in America, they overcome their shortcomings and work to get out of bad situations, not give up on their dreams. Also, How stupid do the writers think lawyers are? If they knew anything about the law firms and how they actually operate, this show would be over in 2 episodes. Mike would have his secret revealed and Harvey would face the consequence. A world class lawyer would have recognized Mike's incompetence in 2 minutes(Just like Harvey did in 1st episode), would have done a background check, and the show would have been over. But I guess it's Hollywood and they live in their fantasy bubble, so let them run it, I'm not watching. Over the years I saw the promos but I thought it was a ripoff of White Collar so I paid it no mind. When I heard Prince Harry was dating a black girl who at first glance I thought was white, I became curious and decided to check this show out. It's Meghan's best work and her strongest acting of her career. The rest of the cast is phenomenal too. Love Jessica (the goddess Gina Torres), Harvey, Mike Ross, Rachel Zane and the rest of the gang. The first few seasons were great then it got silly once Jessica finds out Mike's secret and Harvey and everyone with the constant backstabbing and doublecrossing. The show became more about style over substance. Instead of focusing on legal aspects since it is a series about lawyers at a law firm, it became a soap opera. While Grey's Anatomy had drama in the elevators, this show they walked fast and met in the middle of the hallway.<br/><br/>It could have survived the character of Mike leaving the show and Meghan quitting acting to marry Prince Harry. However it hired show killer Katherine Heigl in its final season who is the Maxwell Caulfield of 21st TV shows. Instead of getting back to the basics, it stayed with the soap opera drama and was cancelled a season after Markle left. The show lasted for eight seasons but the first three seasons were its best. I'm giving this series an 8 just because of how wonderfuly the earlier seasons played out. Unfortunately as it progressed, it went from being refreshing to getting milked for ratings. Where do I begin ?
This show is absolutely amazing. While watching the show I actually feel as if am there in person. It's also a good feel factor. Literary went through every season in a few weeks. Couldn't keep my eyes off the episodes. I WAS a little turned off when Mike Ross and and Rachel Zane were taken off set but it was expected. However I was able to get back into the groove of things knowing it wouldn't be the same but it was still good. It all went down spiral when Mike goes to jail. The story crumbles and the protégé is once again a failure.<br/><br/>I get that suits always triea to bring out the moral conflict inside Mike. A fake lawyer who nevertheless is good hearted and is always putting the others first.<br/><br/>But I simply got tired of him never reaching his full potential. He's always depicted as a genius. The guy that can memorize an encyclopedia or any law book by just looking at the pages. Still somehow all of his decisions are so immature and unintelligent that is makes us doubt of his intellect and thus comes bad writing and bad character development.<br/><br/>The true genius is and always will be Harvey. But its a shame that Mike was introduced as the successor of Harvey and never reaches out to be. He continues to fail in the most stupid ways and lives in Harvey's and his own shadow. First 6 seasons were absolutely fascinating even though I didn't grasp the logic of most legal cases. And how could you not root for each character (maybe except for Louis)? As the show goes on, it's getting ridiculous with all the civil wars of name changing. If I were a law school graduate, I wouldn't work for a firm where its name changes faster than launch of the latest iPhones! Square jaw lead - check

Shake it all up with mediocre writing, horrible stereotypes and some weird reverence for Harvard and you get this show that swaps character development for turning up the volume on character flaws. If you want to watch people arguing all time then this show is for you. From one scene to the next that's all they do. Argue back and forth. I wish I could say the whole thing is awesome. It starts out so great in the first season! But then after a while I feel it's more and more of the same. Just a bunch of fragile ego's trying to one up each other all the time. Lots of repeating gimmicks and stereotypes. Less and less attention for the actual cases. Increasing melodrama that's honestly a bit much. I think the makers noticed this as well and introduced some weird out of character events to make up for it. But it felt forced. I'm really disappointed cause it sparked my interest so much in the beginning. Sadly it doesn't live up to its rating after a few seasons at all. The season is a brilliant piece of production however it slacks down without Mike Ross and rachal . Mike can come back after rachal either goes away to her mother for pregnancy or she dies in a car crash which makes Mike want to go back to the firm and do even a
more daring cases .... After finishing every available episode of House, Bones, Fringe, and Prison Break, I found myself at a loss of what to watch. So as I was browsing for new TV Shows, I stumbled on this one and decided to give it a go. We loved this show until Season 7. The interaction between Mike and Harvey was engaging and smart. Louis is a hoot and absolutely unique as a character. I gave it a 5 because it was so good for so long but it's too bad it didn't stop there. Instead of a lawyer show with interesting characters the story lines devolved into soap opera. We were hoping that the new season would get the characters back into the court room and into the law, but no such luck. Just more soap. Oh well. Wow, Suits is good in its own way but it has an extraordinarily high score for what it is- better than both The Killings, Homeland, The Walking Dead, Broadchurch etc. If it had got a better score than Narcos I would have broken something.<br/><br/>My partner and I tried Suits, not really us but we gave it a go anyway due to majorly rave reviews. We tend to prefer grittier shows, but the promise of style and substance was appealing, plus with so much good stuff to watch, to immediately shut something down just because it doesn't slot within your usual interest seems a bit limiting. <br/><br/>Suits showed some potential in the first season and also the second, fast paced dialogue, interesting events unfolding, amusing characters and high risk decisions. Actually, the characters were well fleshed out, whether you liked them or not and you did get a clear sense of who each were and how they operate so kudos for that. As a woman I particularly liked that there was a strong female lead in the form of Jessica, who is endlessly classy in her demeanour and vernacular, and only a touch power mad. She also dressed conservatively and whilst she is a striking woman she wasn't a sex symbol really which is so, so refreshing. The lead protagonist Mike is quite a forgettable character. Having a dodgy history in selling weed (some hilarious prices being thrown around for that by the way) he spends his law career dodging bullets, worried that many things about his past will be unearthed.<br/><br/>The stars to my taste have to be Louis, who is smarmy, flirtatious and quite outrageous in character but endearing in his enthusiastic passion for his hobbies and his career, he is also great at what he does which ultimately wins secret respect. Harvey is the man all the girls want and the guys want to be, another standout character. Unnaturally calm, collected and a bit of a maverick, he could lead the series singlehandedly in my opinion. <br/><br/>In Needless to say I wasn't overly keen on the characters of Rachel and Donna who though originally became friends through a joint appreciation of razor sharp witticisms, it seems they ended up doing what so many female characters in TV shows do and just discussing guys, sigh. Gossiping, sigh. We already have a billion other shows in that format! A billion other shows centred on love, romance and life. OK so Suits is about sex, money and power but it isn't graphic with what it shows and it should also not be generous with the amount of time these two are spent gossiping like teenagers. There is a humour running through this show, a tongue-in-cheek understanding that each character uses their strengths to deceive, to outwit and to win but by God can't these woman use their brains rather than their beauty. I am not a feminist by the way, just a keen viewer of good, purposeful, reflective TV that challenges you. It's tiring to see such stereotypes, because at least in this legal setting I viewed it because I thought it wouldn't be the case.<br/><br/>Finishing both the first and second series made way for too much of the aforementioned and therein we stopped watching and my 6* review was cast. I'm almost finished watching the end of the second season on Netflix. It's fascinating in many ways, but the overall tone of the interaction among characters is akin to watching gladiators on steroids duke it out under high-stakes conflict. You won't learn much about the legal profession here. Go to see Law and Order or any other legal procedural drama series for that. But if you want to sit back and relax WHILE there's an overabundance of adrenaline running through you, this is a series to watch. Even the female characters must get testosterone injections. Its' Conan the Barbarian against Xena Princess Warrior in tailored suits. I wonder how some of the egos can get though doorways. If the world were really like this, we would be nuclear ash before we were half-way through Season 1. Have fun. Bring popcorn. Hi there, I show episode 10 of s05, It was really awesome, It was full of emotion. I literally cried after seeing it. Like Harvey had Panic Attack" i got "Emotional attack" after i show.. Really telling my faith in family relation got stronger... The way, on the same time, multi story of family relation was evolving it was the peas of cake!<br/><br/>All charterers were giving such a good massage... very good. <br/><br/>This i really good.<br/><br/>This is really very good.<br/><br/>Also want to say the at last the excitement was at top "What will happen next!"<br/><br/>Thanks for making this type of good stuffs. Keep rolling.. This, is a great show. I love it. It has great actors and interesting writing. Until season 5. <br/><br/>Season 5 kicked off to an interesting start with a new 'bad guy' but it turns out it's the joker returns with the batman revenge squad. Don't get me wrong I love the actors who play the joker and the riddler. But this is watching season 2 and 3 all over again.<br/><br/>The plot devices to make mike question his relationship commitment comes from the actor's real life beyond gorgeous fiancée so it makes it humorous but it is so out of place what she tells him to do. Then trev counselling mike is on soap opera level writing I just can't watch the show any more. <br/><br/>Season 5 is a remix of every season jumbled into 1. It feels like a great big long finale and I'd like to think that this is how they put it to rest because to continue on regurgitating the same situations over and over is so played. Suits is on top of its game this season. Although Seasons 1 and 4 were excellent, I personally believe this to be the strongest season of the show. Every single episode packs a solid punch. They hit a home-run with last week's episode (S05E07 - the best episode ever of the show)and have come mighty close with the 8th episode as well.<br/><br/>The Mike-Rachel track was getting a little repetitive and uninteresting, and this episode showed us a glimpse of possible excitement in this track of the show. However, for me, the Harvey-Louis-Donna track has been the real winner this season.<br/><br/>The best part is Suits has already been renewed for Season 6, so they're not going anywhere anytime soon. This show was fine throughout its first couple of seasons, but afterwards the same joke structures got old, the plots became repetitive, and it lost a lot of its shine and became bogged down by the faux seriousness of the situations it created.<br/><br/>Season 4 was honestly a train wreck for the most part, until the very last 3-4 episodes. Just when it was almost all lost, Louis Litt saves the day.<br/><br/>In season 4, Rick Hoffman absolutely carries the show to its highest of highs. The writing for his character is excellent, and his acting is phenomenal.<br/><br/>Watch this show just for Louis, it's worth it.<br/><br/>p.s. As a side note, I had it originally at a 7/10. After seeing the last scene of season 4, that got bumped up quite a bit. I must warm you that I have a soft spot for movies which show people with extraordinary abilities! August Rush, Good Will Hunting, A beautiful mind and all that type.<br/><br/>That being same, Suits is truly awesome!<br/><br/>Fast Paced, amazing humor and out of the world acting. I mean, Gabriel Macht. Phew! I cannot even begin to describe him. He is smart, arrogant and the way he takes every problem just takes your breath away.<br/><br/>Mostly, the whole of Suits is based on law practice. There is a lot of courts and depositions and settlements. Watching this only if you enjoy them!<br/><br/>I sat down for three days and finished two seasons. Then I passed out for 14 hours. Watch at your own risk!<br/><br/>*Sigh* I hate waiting for season three. :( Suits combines humor and suspense that you didn't think is possible. The plot, dialog and twist the shows throws at you is great. The actors portray their parts great and give the audience the serious and drama you would expect but bring in humor and relief as well. You really do need to follow each episode to know what is going on but you'll want to after one episode of watching. One of the two series on television I have to watch every week. Highly recommend watching this series. This is not like a law and order or CSI type show. If you like to see the life of a lawyer, the stress, the creativity, and the indirect humor they portray then this is the show for you. I would say until the end of season 4 is a 10, but I binge watched season 8 and don't even want to watch season 9.
One of the best pilots I've seen, could be a movie on its own. The series is compelling from the start, you care for all characters, they're witty and smart and make for the most part relatable decisions. The romance doesn't overlap the main story which I liked and you see the people change and develop.
When someone goes to a certain bad place (don't want to spoil if someone hasn't watched) the series becomes too serious, characters start making weird decisions just to create conflict. By season 8 there is almost nothing there, the interest for what is going to happen next just disappeared for me. That's why as a whole I can't give it more than 8.
It's a must watch for sure. It's an awesome tv series for those of strong heart and nerves of steel.
50% is all of them arguing, 30% is apologising, 10% is love affairs and 10% is about the law (maybe less).
Still, a great show with the greatest soundtrack! My love for drama immediately boosted, and this show did the job. Harvey and Mike, these 2 as lawyers are superheros which remain unbeatable although they're too beaten a lot. Sometimes it almost feels unrealistic and people comment that but I don't agree to them cos what I leaned from these guys that result and luck truly depends on your hard work and dedication, plus your mind set, focus, will power, approach to winning and be mentally present all the time and seek answers in every way and if you do that rightly then even simplest of dialogue in random conversation can show you way out of the problem and victory is going to belong to you. And talking about Louis, his acting sometimes is so LITT, that I actually sometimes have to say that he's the best actor, and about Donna she's so amazingly witty and sharp. Jessica is so career minded lady and both Harvey and Jessica are emotionally unavailable cos they are so career focused. Which is one thing I don't like about him while Mike is nearly opposite to Harvey by nature, he values life and relationships but both are genius and together they form amazing chemistry. What made me want to watch this show is Mike and Hravey chemistry....Amazing duo....There were some good law cases but I was there only to witness their bromance...I skipped 8 season...and only watched Mike's coming back in 8 and 9 season finale....But the finale was spertacular....It brought us back to the beginning and reminded us why we loved it in the first time. Very good show.. If you're looking for a relatively clean, original, very engaging, relationship building, morally thought-provoking serial, this is worth trying out. Very clean in terms of language at first, but after a couple of seasons the language gets a bit stronger, and from season seven they add in heavy use of the f-word so we stopped at season six. This show is purely for the people with brain.
In love with Harvey Specter. Great start - excellent first 2 seasons. (10/10) Nicely executed next 3 seasons. (9/10) And it should have ended there! I don't wanna spoil anything so I'm not gonna write any details. But, the end of season 5 would be the perfect ending of a perfect series. Unfortunately Suits continued. Seasons 6 and 7 were still good. (7/10) And after that... (right now I'm watching season 8) ... I'm thinking about giving up. In the center of Suits used to be dynamics between Harvey and Mike.. Well.... not anymore. (5/10) .... I watch this show whenever I am bored out of my wits, because it's entertaining to watch nasty law dorks who won't miss a chance to congratulate themselves on how glam and clever they are. Sort of. The sound bites were diverting (for awhile), and the elegant office furniture and office fashion were pleasing ... until they are not.<br/><br/>Characters are people who are supposedly very good at their jobs. (I personally love the addition of Heigl in the last couple of seasons because the drama made it fun to watch.) Characters work under very high-pressure environment, and struggle to balance work and life as they discover and come to terms with their pasts and with who they are. The stakes are high, because a large amount of money is usually involved; once in awhile, there are lawsuits that involve deaths or social justice issues (racial and sexual discrimination, capital punishment, etc.) Certainly not a terrible way to familiarize yourself with the U.S. justice system! The show was spectacular and i truly recommend it to anyone. Yes it's great I don't think it's the same thing you don't Everything about this series is interesting except for the basis of the practice of law. For example, in criminal cases there are no depositions. That happens only in civil cases. And the episode where the client is given an execution date. In New York? Not likely, as the death penalty was ruled unconstitutional by the New York Supreme Court in 2004, and there is no death rows in NY prisons. Makes me wonder if any of the kinds of financial institutions described in some episodes are pure fiction as well. Definitely not Law & Order, but very entertaining otherwise. The show is ultimately about family, whereas the members of the firm grow more and more together as a family.
The early seasons are definately stronger as over time more and more people know about Mike's secret and it becomes less and less believable. The show also gets more tense as in every episode either Mike's secret is about to be exposed or the firm is in danger. whereas in the beginning characters visit each other only on occasion at home, it becomes a normal occurrance in later seasons. Similarly, characters scream at each other in almost every scene.<br/><br/>I think the main characters are all very interesting and the main reason for ticking with the show. Howver, the show does not succeed in keeping up the tension from the first seasons. It's an amazing series, something different then all these shows about death and what not. The witty humour is great but not too much and you get attached to characters quickly. I recommend that everyone watched the Pilot If you don't like it then, don't continue but I knew from that moment onwards I was glued to this series. I will admit as a HUGE fan of this show that sometimes you get the feeling of "oh okay that's a bit of BS" but most shows do but I think overall most cases are dealt with quite fairly. Harvey Spector and Mike Ross combination just takes this series to a whole new level. I have always enjoyed shows about lawyers as I love seeing them in court debating about desperate causes. The ´problem´ with that show is that the point is to negotiate to avoid going to court... So, from this aspect, it is rather frustating. This put aside, the script is smart, the actors are excellent, and even though no one goes to court, there are still great arguments to follow. To be noted that I stopped watching at the end of season 3. So this critic does not apply forward. To be honest: I started watching this series, to see what show the new 'empress of England' starred at, because she's really attractive. But then, I watched two episodes and got addicted!<br/><br/>I've watched 6 seasons within a month and had to stop myself from finishing earlier than that.<br/><br/>I usually hate lawyer TV shows, but this one is different. It has a great cast with fantastic figures in it. Especially Harvey and Louis are fascinating to watch and every episode was fun to watch.<br/><br/>I hope with Markle and Adams leaving, they can keep up that level. I can't wait to see the final season with them. If you haven't been watching Suits on USA Network and you like legal dramas, you are missing out. I don't like legal dramas and I don't have cable so you have no excuse.<br/><br/>I've had it on my Amazon Prime tv cue for a while but hesitated because like I said I don't really like legal dramas. A couple of months ago (before the news of my beloved Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's engagement) I decided to give it a try. I hadn't really heard about it until Meghan Markle and the Prince made their dating public so I was curious.<br/><br/>I had planned on watching ONE episode and ended up binge-watching the entire season. From the pilot, I was entertained by the mostly unknown (at least by me) cast.<br/><br/>Suits is a show that does not take themselves seriously with their witty banter, excessive use of "Goddamn" and the constant reference to pop culture and classic movies.<br/><br/>The Fashion
Everybody on that show is always dressed to the nines. They must spend a small fortune on wardrobe. Gabriel Macht can rock a Tom Ford suit better than any male runway model I've ever seen.<br/><br/>The ladies give office-wear a whole new meaning. Their outfits are what the rest of us would wear at a formal evening out.<br/><br/>The Drinking Game
You could start a drinking game with the amount of time they use the phrase "Shit the bed". Never in one show have I heard that phrase being used so many times.<br/><br/>The Relationships
The relationship we want to root for is Patrick J Adams (Mike) and Meghan Markle (Rachel), we want them to ride off into the sunset and live happily ever after. But watch out, Harvey and Donna really do it for me. The two have such amazing chemistry and Harvey is a lost puppy without his secretary, Donna.<br/><br/>Girl Power
Yes, the show is about Macht and Adam's characters but Gina Torres (Jessica), Sarah Rafferty (Donna) and Markle's Rachel are really pulling the strings. Jessica is the owner of the law firm. Torres plays her with poise, grace, and class. Sure, she doesn't always operate above board but who really does when millions of dollars are at stake? Right?<br/><br/>The Message
Mike has a gift, he has a photographic memory and because of that, not too many things can keep him engaged for a long period of time... except when it comes to the one thing that he is not allowed to do. Practice law.<br/><br/>If you've ever truly loved something and has a passion for it so strong that it burns in your soul, and "politics" has kept you from it then you'll feel for Mike.<br/><br/>I have been in situations where I was good at something but wasn't allowed to do it because of a certain reason. All it takes is one person to give you a shot, in Mike's case it was Harvey.<br/><br/>Mike and Harvey Forever
Harvey and Mike are as in love with each other as two heterosexual men could possibly be. Harvey risked his entire career and his company because he believed in a stranger at the time, Mike. In turn, Mike's loyalty landed him in prison.<br/><br/>I think it is impossible not to love these characters and their friendships. Even Louis Litt, who would do anything for Harvey's attention but as they say "Always shit the bed," is likable and relateable. Either you are him or you know someone like him. One of the best talents on Tv. Most amazing and promising actor. Can't wait to see him on other parts. He is amazing. You forgot you loved anyone else. Without wasting readers time, Suit is captivating and awesome, I have followed the series up till now, but I think one character is lacking. The suit has played out mostly in winnings and settlement but has not revealed the unforgiving character that never bends no matter the settlement or the compromise. Some characters in real life do not mind going to the grave on a particular belief or idea. This kind of Character is yet to be featured. Perhaps the author and writer of Suits write in the dimension that the series should play out, but in my own opinion, I think such character aforementioned should be introduced and explicated in details. But the series is informative. Kudos! From the characters to the story line, i absolutely loved this show. They really love to complicate things when you least expect it you're back to square one.The series has a nice combination of smart and funny and keeps you on your toes all throughout. I love it so much hope it extends to an 8th or even 10th season. Hands down one of the best shows I have ever watched. Among my list are game of thrones, the office, breaking bad, 13 reasons why, stranger things.<br/><br/>So, if you liked those you may or may not enjoy my review.<br/><br/>now, this show is about as factual as CSI or greys anatomy when it comes to actually portraying what a lawyer does but I love it nonetheless. It's actually sad how invested I became with this series but it is so freaking good. The character dynamics, the humor, the romance. The show actually has it all. The show also doesn't follow the cookie cutter formula and is constantly surprising me. I used to like Mike and Harvey the best but then more and more new favorites came along like Rachel, Donna and Lewis Lit. If you don't know those names you surely should watch this show and find out.... In my top 5 all time shows I love Donna, she is smart, funny, hard worker, loyal and very efficient. As a matter of fact, not only she is the best created character in this series, but also she is the shield and weapon of Harvey and he would be lost without her. She is also beautiful and a good friend as well. She is the dream of those who are looking for the ideal friend, girlfriend, coworker, employee, boss, i.e. she prefect and so good to be true, yet the writing and the performance they both made her believable as well as lovable. This is just going to be a quick one, but so far I've got to season 6 episode 10 of the show, watching it non-stop and I think it should have just stopped there. That was the perfect ending for me. Still, it has been a brilliant show and I look forward to seeing where it goes. My only real issue comes with how some of it can be slightly repetitive, particularly towards the beginning of the show with the '1 case per episode' formula, but it was still new then and so it is more excusable there anyway, and as it has progressed much larger and long spanning arcs have been created. Suits had an exceptional start when it first premiered. It was fresh, had style and great story lines. However the show started to take a downward turn after its first few seasons and ever since gone up and down in its quality. Here is my brief summary of the seasons to date, I will try and be succinct in my take on them. <br/><br/>Season 1. Outstanding start and concept whereby a very intelligent person, Mike Ross, was hired by the charismatic Harvey Specter. The two perfectly balanced each other out. Mike would show great intelligence but Harvey would show him how to be a lawyer. Their personalities, lines, jokes and chemistry are a treat to watch. The two take on some great cases together in a cutthroat law firm meanwhile keeping their secret public. Mike tries to manage his personal life with his best friend and his friends ex girlfriend while Harvey urges him to let go of his drug dealing friend who almost got him arrested. Ended with a great cliffhanger that could expose Mike.<br/><br/>Season 2. Very strong start as from the opening Mike is exposed to Jessica who wants to fire him. This turns the table of the entire series as what is Harvey and Mike going to do. We see some thrilling episodes of Harvey trying to keep Mike safe, we also see some great legal cases. Mikes private life is once again heating up and interesting with his friends ex partner becoming his partner. Sadly her time was cut short far too early to unnecessarily pave the way for Rachael. Another great end to the season with Mike and Harvey now at opposite sides and Harvey wanting to fire Mike but Jessica saving him. The story about his fate lurking in the balance makes for great viewing and keeps us tuned in. <br/><br/>Season 3. This is where the show starts to take a big dive. It was nice to see two Game of Thrones actors appear as the writers are fans but they were used for poor story lines. Unlike previous seasons this season revolves around one major story line which is a risk because if it's terrible the show could take a hit, sadly it was terrible. It was an unrealistic, dull and ludicrous story line whereby the main culprit was a lawyer. While this show is about law firms it is ridiculous to make the bad guy a lawyer in an international incident involving far more dangerous parties, it unnecessarily brought it too close to home. The only redeemable aspect of the season was Harvey trying to oust Jessica for managing control. <br/><br/>Season 4. This was the worst season of the show. No one wanted to see Mike leave the law firm to become an investment banker. This is Suits and the uniqueness of the show was him acting as a lawyer while covering his secret. Unless they pulled this off really well it would not fly well, it didn't. Probably the most excruciating and painful part for the audience was the Logan Sanders affair. No one cared and was remotely interested to see a cheap affair between Rachel and Logan Sanders, it was dull and uninteresting. It felt the show forgot what it was about and made it different. Rachel's character I feel at this point became completely unlikeable and overprotected as a character who had a huge emotional reaction to everything for no reason. If you watched The Office she basically became Pam Beasley. <br/><br/>Season 5. The show recovers slightly and improves. Harvey shows us a different and vulnerable side with his panic attacks due to losing Donna. Daniel Hardman returned and it was interesting to see him and Jessica all vie for control of the firm. There were also some other interesting characters added to the mix like Jack Soloff. The show looked more like a soap opera than the kick ass legal drama we first saw. Katrina Bennett would have been far better suited to Mike's character and the show. After Jenny this was another big missed opportunity for Mike's love interest. It also picked up with Mike's secret not being much of a secret anymore with most of his firm knowing and a special prosecutor after him. <br/><br/>Season 6. The show builds on its strengths from last season and further improves. Suits meets Prison Break in a new and unexpected way. Mike is now in prison for something he would have been found not guilty. It was a decent season with seeing Mike survive in prison while Harvey tries to get him out and hold it together at a law firm that has lost its clients and staff because of Mike's fraud scandal. It had a great end with Mike applying to be a lawyer and up for a difficult hearing while now working a legal aid clinic. He also brings his clinic to the law firm. Jessica dropped a bombshell on us by leaving the firm and possibly the show. <br/><br/>Lets see what season 7 has in store, unsure whether I will still be tuned in but maybe the first episodes because of Harvey. Every great show has its points of difference that make it stand apart. The show forgot about its point of difference a few seasons earlier, it also resembled a soap opera with agonizing emotions that people didn't need to see. No one wanted to see a departure from the kick ass legal drama that had so much style. Suits is one of the few TV Shows recently made who comes up with a new point of view about the law world. It follows the story of a brilliant college dropout who manage to get hired in one of the best New York law firms. <br/><br/>The first season contains basically all there is to watch. A super- smart drug dealer who ends up as an attorney; the flaws in the U.S. justice system; and it adds a little bit of romance between the main character and a paralegal from the company. The rest of the show is just pure drama with law terms. <br/><br/>**Spoiler alert** From my point of view, the last season brought something else to the plot, but these are not good news. It follows the story of the main character trying to get out of prison, while his best friend is trying to help him from the outside(I know, it sounds like Prison Break). <br/><br/>Anyway, Suits is not the best TV show of it's kind, but it somehow managed to be really fun to watch. I really enjoyed this programme until the the attempt to demonize the nurses unions, then I realised the US and UK are very different countries. The sub-plots were more memorable than the main activities and characters who were portrayed as unlikable turned out to be more human than the 'heroes'. On reflection the moral subtext was wholly unpleasant, i.e. the legal systems underpinning corporate America are built on elitism and prejudice and peopled by liars and one dimensional. The system and characters are brilliantly portrayed by the actors. Drug dealers, cheat their way into positions of power, fraudsters are promoted - every case the main character worked on would be considered illegal and cost the public purse billions. Once that is understood believability goes out of the window. Absurd plots. The rapid-fire dialogue makes it seem very scripted. The characters aren't given enough time to develop a response - that drives me crazy. Spend less time in makeup and more on script development. Like one of the reviews above, usually I quite trust the IMDB rating. But after I fast-forward almost all series after the first one and finally jumped to the last episode, my stomach just ached. I feel that the script writer probably thinks that the audience has IQ less than 70 and that's why he thinks he can fool people with plot line like this. When I checked the imdb rating, I was shocked to see that almost every season has rating high than 8! Unbelievable! I don't know where it went off. Anyway come back to the series itself. The entire series have no substance but have to fill in with many idiotic dramas - the more dramatic, the better. Like the one said above, I almost skipped every scene when Rachel and Mike are together. If I want to watch love drama, I would choose other series which have done much better than Suits. Donna slept with Harvey and many years later, she quitted being secretary to Harvey. This whole thing is such a bullshit, just to make the audience hang on to the drama (unfortunately there is no way). <br/><br/>Mike: started as a genius but what all he did was just stupid- falling in love with Rachel and tell everyone he is a fraud. <br/><br/>Harvey: His family drama and later on his seeing physatris is just pure bullshit. He claims that he never loses and in the end he let Mike land in prison. This can be blame purely on Harvey's character but the screen writer who just wants to be politicaly correct, practising law without a law degree, one surely should land in prison. Why not? But could you please be a bit controversial with the ending?<br/><br/>Donna: She is annoying at the very beginning and just gets more and more annoying as the series develop. Being a secretary, surely she is almost as smart as the genius in the law firm. Why the hell does she end up being a secretary then? The series try to portrait her as a omnipotent person. But in the last season, when she testified in Mike's case, she tumbled over a very simple question to prove that Mike is a fraud. Does it make any logical sense that one's IQ can be dropped suddently below 70 from 200 earlier on?<br/><br/>I will stop here and have already wasted much time fast-forward all series because of my stubborn character. I would not spend a minute more over the series. An entire law firm upside down. Everyone seems to be losing it – their cool and their jackets. Something's amiss. Apparently a deal has gone astray or someone used a short sleeve shirt with a tie. It was chaos. From that scenario emerges the smirking Harvey Specter, solving the apparent crisis effortlessly and, above all, stylishly. That's Harvey, but we eventually learn that there's not all that is to him.<br/><br/>Bored out of his mind, since it is not that interesting to be the best at what you do, he is presented with the opportunity to hire a guy who might spice things up. Michael is a man on a mission. The mission is delivering a boatload of weed, and he fails it remarkably, letting it spill all over the floor in an accidental job interview – this scene is as unexplainable as unconceivable. But we buy it because it's fun.<br/><br/>Harvey goes ahead and hires the young mnemonist humorous drug courier as a lawyer with no qualifications (with Community, this makes for the second premiering TV show with a degreeless attorney).<br/><br/>From then on, the show is all about Michael and his professional/personal dramas plus Harvey and his demonstration of coolness/personal growth.<br/><br/>Michael always wanted to be an attorney but somehow something got in the way. He is troubled by his one-time drug endeavour and his latent feelings for his best friend's girlfriend. Further down the line, this love triangle gets one angle shorter, which is promptly replaced. Nothing new here, cliché after cliché.<br/><br/>Continue reading here: wp.me/p26fjD-1Y This was an amazing TV series. Sorry to see being cancelled by the network. What would Harvey Spector do? Would he give up so easily? No!
Netflix, what would you say about picking up "Suits" and continue the legacy? Such an annoying show. I am on season 6 only because I want to see who is going to end up with who, but my patience is running out so I'll probably just google it. The characters are very inconsistent, especially the main guy (Mike Ross). He is an hypocrite, very sly, pushy, manipulative, and a real 'artist' to quote one of the other characters. All of this would be fine if only we weren't constantly manipulated into taking his side. It only works for the two seasons. though, and, sadly, once we actually realise how compromised the protagonist is, the show becomes unwatchable. Rachel (Megan M) is very good at the start, but then she just cries all the time (sorry, it was meant not to contain any spoilers). Seen the series since the pilot. loved it from start as it involves one great attorney and the other a genius-minded hidden lawyer stoner. <br/><br/>The introduction of the character Harvey was your typical douche opening with him closing it with a gorgeous babe, showing off his awesome skills in closing just about anything. <br/><br/>Mike on the other hand, the struggling highly ambitious lawyer finds himself back to the correct path after one set up that he cleverly see especially in the condition that he was stoned the day before!<br/><br/>The series definitely got me intrigued and got me over the couch edge excited for the next episode. This series is very beautiful because of its wits, intelligence, cooperation, romance, revenge and suspense.<br/><br/>When I started watching it I could not stop only when necessary and at the end of the episode I yearn to see the next episode<br/><br/>I never imagined that I was attracted to watch the end of this series and it was a beautiful and sad end at the same time.<br/><br/>In fact, I did not want the series to end, but each beginning has an end.<br/><br/>Thank the director, producer and all those in charge of this mighty series.<br/><br/>Thank the director, producer and all those in charge of this mighty series.<br/><br/>I would also like to thank all actors and wish them every success. Well in Germany I just could watch till Season 6 and in my mind it was amazing the Story telling the actors and it was really smooth to watch but since I heard Mike (Patrick J. Adams) and Rachel (Meghan Markle) wouldnt be there anymore after Season 7 I dont know if the series can be that Good as before but I'm still optimistic and wait for the new Seasons in Germany Season 8 is a big disappointment. It is either too personal when it is about Luis or too legal when it is about everything else. Stories and plot is a total disaster. <br/><br/>I never thought it will look this bad after Rachel and Mike left, but it does. Simply, season 8 is the biggest disappointment ever. I always thought suits was the best TV show ever, unluckily, season 8 ruined the whole experience. <br/><br/>Looking for another interesting show now. This is my first review and decided to make it for this show. This was one of my favorite shows for a very long time. But I must say after season 6 this whole show started falling apart. These writers have very very limited vocabulary since every other word on the show now is "goddman". It is getting very annoying. And now that Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams) has left the show, there is absolutely no reason for me to watch this. Which is sad because I have always been a fan of Dulé Hill (because of Psych) and when I saw he was the "Ross" replacement I was sooo happy. But then, same thing, every other word out of Hill's mouth is GD. GD this and GD that. Let's pick a different word writers... This is the best TV show and I wonder why it has never received any awards. I would suggest everyone to watch it and once you start watching it you'll thank me for suggesting the show to you. The show gets interesting from the first episode itself when a drug dealer but a genius guy trying to ditch the cops , ends up giving interview to the New York's best Closure Harvey Specter. Two lawyers , One degree and one big secret. The story will thrill you and you will get addicted to the show. Those people are very lucky who will get to watch it for the first time. I myself have watched the entire series for like 6-7 times. So, Enjoy the show and take a look towards professionalism. #Suitsforever #Teamspecterandross I'm usually biased to law and court series (The Good Wife is one of my current favorites) but this takes it to a whole new level.. You can say it is like "The Practice" and "Frasier" mashed into one series ! The show is sassy, sophisticated, and funny as it could be. It has the smartest dialogue and punch lines delivered perfectly by the cast, they are all brilliant but some shine more than others, specifically Mike and Donna's characters are just over-the-top hilarious scene-stealers with their perfect facial expressions and intelligent delivery of their funny and refreshing scripts. You wanna be friends with all of them ! I'm already in season 3 and I'm glad that the show is still running with season 6 coming out soon and shocked as hell when I found out it was snubbed by the major TV awards, this show should have showers of noms and wins... A must see ! Suits Reminds me the white collar series,a genius criminal who is a good guy actually but he didn't have the choice to be good and have money at the same time,so another person(in this case a professional lawyer) gives him this chance,in white collar Nill6¥1 6¥1was running from his past all the time,just like Mike in the suits,the serial has two line of stories: 1.the main story:<br/><br/>the main story is about mike,how he deals with his personal problems,his connections with girls and his best friend,the main story line is good,but not good enough,its really weaker than the white collar's main story line but still,you can enjoy it. 2.the stories that would begin and finish in just one episode: The best reason for watching this serial is this kind of stories,they are very good. actually I can say they are even better than their kind in white collar. Its fun serial after all, it doesn't have the secrets like the lost series showed us before,and its characters don't deal with huge problems like characters in prison break series did.but still,it is a very good choice for those who like to watch both comedy and drama at the same time,in my opinion suits is not a "Must watch".its not that great really.but you can enjoy it and it never let you down.so have some free time? Watch this,you will like it for sure. I really like this show because of the characters and the plot. It's great that they put an ordinary pot dealer into a huge law firm which makes it more interesting. Suits deserves a bigger rating than this.<br/><br/>I am always excited when a new episode comes up because each one brings a tense and a gripping ending.<br/><br/>It's really a show that contains quality, intelligence, cliffhangers and comedy.<br/><br/>All in short, you will get immersed in this series and i recommend this show to everyone.<br/><br/>-K i can't remember have seen such a fine TV show for a long time. stunning season finale and more generally, a great quality TV show. this is due to true personalities of its characters and its magnetics actors. i bet it's gonna be a blockbuster in France where the show hasn't been released yet. please, keep going making such artistic choice for TV and congratulations for every guy who participates by any means to the creation of this show. and don't you dare to inform us by the end of the year that the show is over due to a lack of audience of any other stupid excuse.<br/><br/>Magnificent series. incisive, accurate, stylish. probably one of the best on the market today. its actors, playing the card of the seduction and the aristocratic coolness contribute mainly to the success of the series as well as the way the director decided to show New york. This show is riveting as hell. After Game of Thrones was done with their season i was like "there won't be another show anytime soon that can capture ones imagination". Suits changed that. The flow is amazing and if you think that this show is going to be just another courtroom drama then you can't be more wrong. The individual characters are good on their own. There is no need for support. The story is driven more by their flaws and qualities. It not just a court room drama, because there aren't many court room scenes in the show. The brotherly relationship and love between the lead characters is just amazing to watch. Harvey wants to say to mike that i love you like a brother that i never had but he just can't seem to open up to mike. And mike in his own flawed universe can't seem to find it in himself to trust Harvey to have his back 'which he always does'. This is my new favorite show after Game of Thrones of course. Do watch this show. It is well worth your time. I just finished season 8. Now, I am reflecting on the show that I have spent the last couple of months watching. Season 1 was brilliant, lightning in a bottle. The cast, dialogue, and pace were excellent. The courtroom drama was interesting and Mike's supernatural abilities were reminiscent of rainman minus the social awkwardness; I was hook and couldn't wait for more. Season 2 brought some gravitas with the entrance of Daniel Hardman and put some real stakes in the matter. I enjoyed seeing Jessica and Hardman duke it out.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, season 3 and the arrival of the British firm really started the decline of the show in my opinion. After this, I felt like the show repeated the same formula over and over: Firm or career threatening incident presents itself, characters bickering about it, and hasty resolution with minimal explanation. That along with the Donna drama became very tiresome.<br/><br/>Although it was initially charming for Donna to finish people's sentences and "know everything," it got old fast and she quickly became one of my least favorite characters. Season 8 was nauseatingly full of Donna being a know it all. The exit of one of my favorite characters, Jessica Pearson was a tough pill to swallow as I felt that she carried a lot of the weight of the show. Furthermore, the neutering of Mike's character was another tough pill to swallow. Not only did his supernatural memory ability seem to fade into the background, he just became a boring character. The drama with Trevor faded too quickly and he kind of devolved into a smarmy jerk.<br/><br/>I should be rating this show lower as it declined after season 2, but there were some great moments peppered throughout the series that kept me interested enough. I was surprised to look ahead and see that there is a season 9. I think I would watch it out of sheer curiosity, but I don't know that I'd expect anything different.<br/><br/>All in all, the first two seasons are worth a watch, but seasons 3-8 are anti climactic and don't carry the same weight as the first two. All I can say is a big THANK YOU to all the Suits family because you really made it!!
This is definitely one of the very best shows of all times!! We won't ever forget this show, and we will happily view it again just like if it was the first time! Thank you to all of you for this masterpiece!! This is one of the best series with law firms. I would give it 10 stars with no thought. If you want to keep your good memories of this series don't see the last 2 episodes of Season 5.<br/><br/>I'm not going to give spoiler, but I would say that final episode of Season 5 totally destroyed the whole series. I am not even sure if I will be willing to see Season 6 after this finale.<br/><br/>It looks like writers and producers are tired of this series and wanted to finish it over a night.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this series, do it. Watch Season 1 to 4. But for me, don't even bother about season 5. In 2011 USA launched what-would-be the second highest-rated show of that year, losing only to GoT. "Suits" is about lawyers at a top-tier NYC firm that goes through more name changes than Sean Combs. It reminds me of a more serious, edgier version of "Franklin & Bash". Here's a category breakdown:<br/><br/>Writing: The writing has absolutely matured and gotten bolder since season one. It doesn't get too controversial because the stories and plots, so far, haven't really required that. But it's smart, (dry) witted, razor sharp, and moves at a pace quick enough to not bore, but not so quick as to lose you. If you're a fan of "Breaking Bad", you'll like and appreciate how some things aren't put out there right away. They're saved for flashback episodes, and seamlessly work.<br/><br/>Characters: Their various developments are what adds to this show's charm. Everyone has their own backstory, though some aren't as filled-in (yet) as others. The show doesn't start off where the two male leads are a team. That's mostly why the pilot is 90 minutes. How they do come together epitomizes "right place right time". Macht's and Adams' chemistry is as good as it gets. Rick Hoffman is brilliant as Louis Litt; he's a scene-stealer. It's obvious why the six leads were cast. You can tell (most of) their characters have been together for years. <br/><br/>Overall: This has become one of my favorite shows to watch. Right now it's the only show I have to anticipate during the summer, so my excitement for Wednesday is further amplified. The stories will intrigue, you'll both love and hate pretty much everyone at least twice. In the end, "Suits" is a winner. But since "true" perfection is arguably a myth, I score it 9.5/10. There is not a single boring episode of 'Suits'. Those leaving bad reviews are just intimidated by the big words that they can't seem to comprehend and evidently can't spell them either. <br/><br/>There are few 'good' lawyer shows out there and 'Suits' really is your clichÃ©d lawyer show. You make a doctor show (Greys Anatomy etc) you expect health emergencies and whatnot. You make a police show (CSI, Hawaii Five-O etc) you expect shootouts and arrests. Similarly in a lawyer show you expect witty comebacks, intelligent problem solving, enthralling class action lawsuits and a bit of dirty tactics-which is exactly what 'Suits' provides. Maybe it isn't your typical show because it doesn't have romances left right and center or maybe because it doesn't have emotions flying about everywhere. I've seen reviews say that each episode is the same as the last just with different client names and scenarios. I can tell you those people are wrong. Each season has it's own theme with immense character development. Legal battles, personal battles and work related fracas all of which make up the baseline for 'Suits', not to mention the shows intelligent and well thought out premise. <br/><br/>The journey of Harvey and Mike is one to follow very closely because unlike other shows, these two are vulnerable and actively make mistakes. They don't pretend like they can solve everything and sometimes they do come off second best but it just makes the victories that much sweeter.<br/><br/>The writers have kept the series going at 100% for the good part of 4 seasons and I don't see them slowing down anytime soon. This show is absolutely amazing. At first when I watched the Pilot I didn't seem that intrigued by it, but after watching 3-5 episodes of it I was immediately submersed in it.<br/><br/>It's very classy, unique, has many twists involved and intertwining relationships between the characters.<br/><br/>If you like law, political related shows/movies you'll enjoy this thoroughly.<br/><br/>This show is very intelligent, the writing and acting is perfect. Harvey specter is ABSOLUTELY brilliant! I didn't expect to have such amazing acting!<br/><br/>I genuinely recommend this TV show, it's amazing and you'll get hooked. it is just one of the best TV series out there, and I really recommend watching it. it has all the requirements for a successful TV show, drama, comedy and it just gets you to be kinda anxious to figure out what is going to happen in the next episode. For me it made my interests in the law department deeper, i understand their terms, how they think, and it even makes me want to be a lawyer. in this series, they always outsmart the opponent, yet it gets you to suspect whether they are going to win or no. it is by far the best series i have ever watched, ever since i was done watching "House MD.", i never really found anything to watch, so if you liked the show "House MD" you would definitely like this one it has humor as well as mystery. After being bored to death by a sudden lack of TV shows (the annoying time between seasons), I went hunting for TV shows; Fortunately, I found Suits.<br/><br/>For once I found a TV show that is good and doesn't have high levels of sexual content or even violence. Of course there is the odd thing here and there, but that's modern TV for you.<br/><br/>In addition, this show has an amazing plot. It makes you (or me anyways), feel for the characters in a way some shows fail.<br/><br/>All positive things aside, there are some legal terms thrown around that can catch you off guard. Fortunately, when this happens, the plot somehow finds a way of making what you didn't understand clearer later on in the plot.<br/><br/>All in all, this show is definitely a must watch. Maybe you won't like it, but at least give it a shot! Great chemistry through out! Good stories and fun to watch! I am disappointed in the recent episodes language. At first I thought "here is a decent show with good stories and a minimum of foul language" .The producers must be aware that this is the most singled out reason that people object to in movies and cable. Then the last few episodes here comes the so called "Adult Language" which is in fact mostly used by young teens. Come on do not ruin this program with this kind of distraction. Stay with the great chemistry and stories. Sorry this is all I have to say about this program. I hope it gets printed because it needs 10 lines There's a flood of court room type of TV shows. But this one tops them all.<br/><br/>This show has depth. It's not plastic. It has great characters, superbly built scenes and dialogue. The cinematography looks and feels great. The story is well crafted and moves nicely from one episode to the other. Almost like a mini series. Oh yeah and the plot is also great. It will turn in directions you wouldn't expect it to go.<br/><br/>The best thing though are definitely the characters. Kudos to the story editors and director.<br/><br/>This is one of the best show currently on TV. It's up there with boardwalk empire and game of thrones (not quite but that's just because of the budget differences).<br/><br/>My only grief is that it could have more depth in a more "artisty" kind of way. It's still a little plasticy, but it has to be. It's a TV format. This is why I give it 9 out of 10 stars. And even this is to harsh. I just hope it doesn't get repetitive. I know that a TV series has to have a basic structure that is unique to it but just don't let it get to much like a maths formula (like House Md. for instance).<br/><br/>Keep making the show great guys! Continue making great deep characters and excellent plot. This kind of work motivates the rest of us to produce better films, to be better at what we do! Br S Suits is one of those totally implausible stories, like Castle for example in which a mystery writer somehow in allowed to team up with a real life detective; in this case it's a guy with no law degree who somehow gets a job in a prestigious law firm. Well, we believed Mr. Ed could talk, so why not? I just finished watching the first episode and I'm a little hooked. I'll keep watching. There were some stupidities in the first episode, like how our hero got hired to deliver a briefcase of marijuana worth about five grand for twenty-five grand, but I'll assume that was just a change in the plot at the last moment, since that would have made sense if it was four pounds of coke instead of four pounds of pot but I'll just assume they decided the coke scenario would be too HBO-ish and not USA-ish. I'll just put that aside and give the future episodes the benefit of the doubt that stupid stuff like that isn't going to continue. This doesn't seem like it's going to be the most engaging show ever like Damages or Rescue Me, but it does seem to have some potential. We'll see. I am not putting my review here so that you do not watch this series.. The series is fun.. I watch beginning seasons like 1,2,3 again..<br/><br/>Till 4 is fine.. than it gets monotonous. U start getting bored.. After five its like indian saans bahu drama with 7-8 main characters, less content and more showoff.<br/><br/>I am more of a fan of settlement meetings, court room drama and case study .. but after a while the series stopped offering that. So it was bore... after s5 u will probably start skipping emotional scenes.. conversations.. and finish an episode of 30 minutes into 10.<br/><br/>DO watch episode 1&2 and get BLOWN AWAY.. When I started watching this I couldn't get enough of it. Mike, Harvey, Rachel, and who could forget Luis. Amazing crew, who brought us entertainment from day to day.<br/><br/>Indeed the show provides you all the elements needed for one spectacular TV entertainment. For me it captured everything that you needed in one TV show.<br/><br/>Now to the moment at hand. I did quit watching show when Rachel and Mike left, and to be honest. Last season with them was kinda boring, because you could feel they were not into it anymore.<br/><br/>I don't know how much longer they gonna prolong it with new characters. I can only say good luck. Just one word needed: perfect. Perfect writing, perfect cast, and a perfect run. Suits is hands down one of the best series out there! It's got everything and delivers every single emotion flawlessly. Thank you to the suits family for 9 wonderful seasons Thank you. It will be missed. Thoroughly enjoyed the show and seeing the development of all the characters over the years. Here's hoping for a spinoff. This TV Series is a sure-shot winner in the Drama Category/Genre. The writing, the cast, the background score everything just falls into place at the perfect moments. It also teaches you life's basic or small learnings which you tend to forget in your everyday lives. It shows you to be a better human being & how to work hard on yourselves every single day. Speaking personally, I just love this Show more than anything. It is an emotional roller-coaster full of spice, great soundtracks, great lines, ethics and morale. Wow viewing. Have a feeling that the makers of the series have truly decided against a season 10. Fooey - hopefully just trying to spark an outcry from Suits fans. Note to producers, please keep the show going! In the arid sea of potboiler story lines & cardboard characters Suits is a breath of fresh & elegant air! Clever scripts with characters that seem so real. Adore the glamorous hand stitched lapelled designer suits, pencil skirts & stiletto Laboutins. I LOVE this show! The banter is priceless. Even without Mike, the interaction between characters is, amazing. Heigl is a wonderful addition. I'm a bit late in arriving to this show. I am on season four and constantly stop binging. It's rare that a show has such a likeable and believable cast. This isn't epic drama lie Breaking Bad or the Wire. However it has so much heart and compassion and humour It is a highly intelligent "drama" about real people. I cant recommend it enough. This TV show is really steeling my time, well... it definitely worth it to... why is that? Because this TV show is fully stuffed with lessons, tricks, politics, games, psychology, techniques, role models, perfect decisions and many things I can't count.
Jessica: she's simply the perfect leader
Harvey: a gladiator
Mike: a great man and the he's the mind master of the firm
Rachel: the woman behind the greatness of Mike Ross
Dona: The nerd who do few mistakes; but the worst mistakes ever
Luis: A body of emotions,Imagine how would this be in a tough business environment
Daniel Hardman: He's the MF you're going to meet in every workplace in your life Hands down Louis Litt is my favorite character! He is the type of person that shows even though he lets his emotions get the best if him in situations, he still has the courage to tell his subordinates and equals when he is wrong. In my opinion that is the most realistic idea of the real world, not just for a TV show. As much as I love the story lines and the characters, the constant use of escalating bad language completely spoils it. It didn't start out that way, and gets worse with each season. No-one swears like that in real life, at least no-one I know, and a lot of it is out of context and unrealistic. ALL of the characters use bad language, which is unrealistic in itself, as a lot of people don't use it, particularly in the workplace and never to clients! Drop the language, it doesn't need it, it's a great show without it! So we all know there are tons of great shows about police officers. Hill Street blues, law and order (which is the only one that I know of that goes so deep into both lawyers and the cops life) and many others. This show is strictly about lawyers. <br/><br/>I have to say if you are going to watch this show you have to be intelligent to understand and grasp a lot of concepts. They have movie references in every part of the show....from rocky, the a few good men, to the godfather. You have to know your movie references to even get some of the jokes on here. But I'm also on here being a nerd writing movies reviews on a movie review website, so a bunch of quotes from movies is pretty much right around my alley.<br/><br/>The plot is great. There is mike the man character who is just a person who can retain knowledge better than anyone else. Kind of a 90's idea, seen it a 1,000 times, good will hunting and so on. But he gets caught cheating on a test and then is forced out of the school. So he still skins by in life cheating for people on test. His roommate ask him to deliver some weed for him at a hotel. Same one where they are having interviews for lawyers at. When he goes upstairs to the room he notices it looks like undercover cops keeps walking until he runs into the interview room and they precedes to sweet talk his way into becoming a lawyer with no degree.<br/><br/>The show spends most of its time hiding the fact that he doesn't have a degree. So just as I put it, you would think the show would run out of time till it just got boring hiding the fact that he is not a real lawyer. And at sometimes it does but the writers seem to have one thing going for them. Every character they have in the show is totally unique from other shows.<br/><br/>Jessica is a black woman incharge of a law firm. Yeap a black woman in charge of a law firm. I'm not going to get racial or political here. But that in itself makes it rare. And she looks good and is professional. And her firm is involved in some shady business tactics here and there. But its not your typical stereotypical involvement i see in other shows. And to me that just means the writers are creative and have a lot of material they can write about instead of beating up the old stereotypical drum a lot of writers love to give their audience.<br/><br/>Mike's character is very nice as well. Yes hes really smart, and he retains knowlegde well but he plays off harvey. His boss who hired him. Mike is a hungry associate who wants to just do good. Kind of like how I started off and still do at work when I go to work. I just want to win and look good doing it and prove I actually am the most knowledgeable in field. <br/><br/>But Harvey honestly what makes this show. You see of glimpse of gabriel in black hawk down and even in the small glimpse of him. Hes still a great actor. But here he gets to go at it. Sure he looks like your typical gordon gekko. But he just talks with a sarcastic attitude and if he has to punch some one in the face or but you in the court room its your choice. Without Harvey character this show wouldn't last.<br/><br/>In all the show itself is amazing, great one liners, great movie references, and simply gives you a look not into the real world of lawyers but it does get you familiar with filing papers and honestly how you have to be on your toes. I know in lala land people feel how do lawyers lose cases, hes guilty but they are not taking in the account of what a lawyer is, a profession. And if somebody beats you at your game. Whether the person is guilty or not, it doesn't matter they hired someone to do a job and they didn't do their job, or did do their job. Plus all the research that takes place. <br/><br/>I said before you have to be intelligent to watch this show. Intrigued by lawyers and the research they do plus entertained by sarcastic comments. And If that doesn't get you, all the actors are well polished actors, not over the top. A lot of them are on other shows. This show won't be around forever. They will run out of material. The actors will go on to have great careers. But with that said this show got a 10 out of 10 for me. In 2017 you aren't going to find a show like this. Some of the shows people ask me to watch feels like I lost a few brain cells. Just like Mike on suits I like to fill my brain with un useful knowledge. I mean why else would i go through IMDb just read all the trivia about movies people never watch, right? Nowadays we are so into crime, law, the art of the deal, and the art of the con that we have a plethora of shows on TV that deal with these very things.<br/><br/>USA has brought us Suits, a sophisticated, well-acted show about the inner workings of a law firm, and it's truly one of the better ones. Having worked in a law firm for many years, so much of it rings true.<br/><br/>First off, on Suits and White Collar, New York City has never looked so good. Having recently seen a repeat of Kojak -- New York is neither all as seedy as what is shown on Kojak nor as sparklingly beautiful as Suits, but who cares. The cinematography is wonderful.<br/><br/>The law firm is managed by Jessica Pearson (Gina Torres) who dresses like something out of Vogue (and looks like something out of Vogue). She's tough and has the unenviable job of dealing with Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman), an impossible man, and the firecracker, egomaniacal Harvey Spector (Gabriel Macht).<br/><br/>Before some changes in the story, Harvey's secretary was Donna (Sarah Rafferty), a clever, resourceful redhead who will do whatever it takes to help her boss. Then there is Rachel (Meghan Markel), another beauty, whose father is a well-known attorney; she is currently a paralegal studying law.<br/><br/>The big secret of the firm is that they have a sharp lawyer who is not a lawyer in Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams). He has a brilliant mind, a feel for the law, and a photographic memory, but he left college because he took tests for other students and was exposed. His next career was as a drug dealer. Then he became an associate, at the firm, working with Harvey Spector. He has no law degree. If anyone finds out, there will be hell to pay. It hangs over the first seasons of the show like a machete.<br/><br/>We become involved with not only the cases but the private lives of these characters, from Donna's latent acting ambitions, the Mike- Rachel romance, Harvey's problems with various women, his ongoing feud with Louis, Louis' romance with a law recruiter, and everything in between.<br/><br/>Suits is an excellent, involving show, and I'm not saying that just because I have met and love Stephen Macht, Gabriel's father, who has been on the show a few times as a law professor. I can only say the Machts are a wonderful family. And the show is wonderful, with a wonderful family of characters, some of whom are a little around the bend, and all of whom are interesting. Highly recommended. As far as i'm concerned the show started out wonderfully and got worse until , by Episode 4 , the show was on it's way out. I see 'viewers' loved it as it went along but i contend 'Suits' lost many folks as the show progressed. I just noticed there's not a scene where alcohol isn't portrayed to accompany any major success or situation of value etc. But, mostly , watching the 'dramaesque' samo samo got too tiring. I could tell what Mike and Rachel were going to do before the show started. The emotions that bounced between them was almost not tolerable becoming 'trite'. The series just ran out of steam , ran out of good writing. The acting was fine from beginning to end and i loved 'Harvey' who stayed the course. Louis was wonderful , Donna , Jessica. I got to love em all. And, enjoyed the situations and wonderful actors that came and went. But, the 'soap opera' jazz got too heavy as plot and writing got weaker. Harvey is to Law as House is to medicine. But, this show petered out in it's insistence to over work Mike and Rachel and , even , Donna's character. The alcohol thing is just a 'little thing' but it's not. Good show though. Hello all SUITS fans!!! I'd like to start of by pointing out the quality and the effort from all the actors,directors,and producers of this TV-series.<br/><br/>It is truly amazing how much time went into making these episodes and if you've watched interviews with the actors on Youtube then you already know how well each actor is suited to its character.<br/><br/>Personally to me SUITS is a TV-series which not only reflects real life situations in a law firm, but also shows a great deal of social interactions between employees and the two combined is a perfect mix.<br/><br/>It is hard to put it in words but right from Season 1 to Season 3 the viewer is hooked to the screen. The eccentric value of events and twists in the script could not be better done. "Mike" who is starred by Patrick J. Adams is a whiz-kid who as we find out never went to law school yet he is working at the most well-known law firm in NYC. His relationship with "Rachel Zane" starred by Meghan Markle is complicated yet at the end of the day the two are a perfect match.<br/><br/>Season 1 started with a twist, personally I did not expect the story to unfold this way. My first thought was that his best friend "Trevor" would be the one who will make loads of money eventually them two would become super rich. And it turned out exactly the opposite..In Season 1 episode 5 Trevor is bailed out by Mike who is now "taking care" of his friend who screwed up his life by dealing drugs. These are the kind of twists that make suits so valuable.<br/><br/>I am really glad that Rachel and Mike finally "bonded" by the end of Season 2(Start of Season 3) I hope that mike continues to succeed while Rachel might be away..in law school. The new episode will be on USA channel on 20th of August,Wednesday and it will be interesting to see the flashback "10 years ago".<br/><br/>I am hoping the forthcoming episode will be just as exciting as the previous ones.<br/><br/>And to finish off..As all the actors were asked in an interview to describe Season 3 in one word i will say its challenging.<br/><br/>I hope you enjoyed reading this review, and keep on watching SUITS! follow them on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter! and keep supporting these actors they deserve heaps of recognition! :) I tend to be extremely picky about the TV shows I choose to watch because I have a tendency to lose interest fast. For me to consider a show to be "good" it must keep me engaged episode after episode which brings me to SUITS.<br/><br/>SUITS was one of the shows I accidentally got hooked on. I saw the trailers for it and seemed interesting. I gave it a try and watched the pilot without any expectations of liking or disliking the show. Turns out, after watching the pilot episode I have found myself counting down the days week after week anticipating the newest episode to air. SUITS is by far one of the best shows on television in its class and has become one of my all time favorites. It's such a great show I recommended it to one of my friend's and he bought Season 1 and finished it in 2 days. <br/><br/>If you haven't seen it...get caught up cause you're missing out. The fact that I'm a huge fan of shows like GOT, Dexter, etc... "basically shows with lots of thrilling situations and suspense" made me hesitate a bit whether to watch this show or not. It turned out that this is a really very well made TV show. It reminds me a lot of the show "House" which is one of my favorite shows out there. The story is really clever and sophisticated. The drama in this show is served in a perfect amount and surprisingly, it doesn't seem fake or forced. The actors do an amazing job in this show. The characters are very believable and convincing. It was really nice for me to take a break from all the suspense I'm used to from watching the shows I usually watch and give something like this show a try. SUITS is an over pleasure to watch with several moments that will make you laugh till it hurts and other that will make you want to burst out into tears because of s gripping moment. Personally i don't believe there to be many/any flaws with the program, as it will always keep you on your feet, wanting to know what happens next. However there are times when you just want to brake your TV in shear rage for what you just saw (NOT ALWAYS A BAD THING). If you have not got round to watching it yet then i strongly recommend watching it as you will not be able to give it up after watching the first episode. Overall it's a great show with so many lovable characters that make you want to come back for more and i'm hoping that it will continue to air for a number of years to come. Thank you for reading. Legendary characters, beautiful, hot, dialogs very excellent and interesting 9 beautiful seasons I recommend to follow this series, I watched 2 seasons in 2017 then stoped for a reason that i don't remember. Then this year I decided to repeat the previous seasons and complete the others. I finished suits In 2 months. there are some rare days that I benched watched for 8 hours.<br/><br/>I have written a review (in my notes) for almost every season. Here i wrote a review for 1 season then wrote an overall.<br/><br/>Review for season 3<br/><br/>Suits season 3 episode 10 Would nearly be a perfect ending for me if the show stopped I would give it a 9 or even higher.
<ul><li>Jessica New about Mike and Rachel relationship.</li><li>Harvey finally showed his feelings and said That he loves scotty(which I wanted more than him and Donna)</li><li>Mike will stay with Rachel and Rachel will go to Harvard Throughout a deal she made with Jessica</li><li>The firm name is pearson spector.</li><li>Louis and sheila are together</li><li>I said nearly perfect not perfect because louis knew that mike is a fraud</li></ul><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Overall: 8.5 wouldve been better if no new irritating characters showed up. And if Harvey and Michael stayed together throughout the whole show.<br/><br/><ul><li>Really hated the things that happened between Mike and Rachel and Jenny. In season 1. It's like a love triangle and i Hate that in all shows/films/anime.</li><li>Really hated the puzzles in this show like the can opener ritual between Harvey and Donna which was never explained in the show. I've read about it in the Internet and no one seems to know what the hell is the ritual.</li><li>The show (To me) could've ended in season 3 or 4 but it continued.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>After season 5 the show became a little bit boring to me and lost its taste here is why:</li></ul>* Jessica left the firm.
* Michael became a guy who couldn't do anything in court(couldn't practice law because of his crime sentencing).
* later on mike left the firm
* The director introduced us to an unnecessary actress (samantha) which he portrayed as the tough crapy dishonest disrespectful woman (really crapy baby harvey) which say she never loses blul bluh. and i hated the show because of her. Even when she lost it wasn't satisfying.
* Also gibbs losing wasn't satisfying at all. after all she did to mike and jesica and harvey. She deserves to be killedðŸ˜‚. Shamed then killed.<br/><br/><ul><li>Didn't necessarily love the ending. Harvey left. the best closer in New York made a deal that he would back off. That sounds like giving up to me.</li></ul> I love it, it's inspired me to the real deal. I love you guys you're the real hero's. I enjoy the whole premise and the fast paced development of the story. I love the secondary characters especially Lewis. Its a outstanding drama with a heart give it a chance you will love the characters, stroy and so much more am only on season 4 yeah i know am late for the party but so far it's great and this way i can watch with out any breaks. Also that intro song is awesome haha What a boring last season...or a few
Amazing how on this show, there are either really great actors or really bad ones. Especially Markle in the last season. You could see she doesn't feel like acting being in love with Mike.
Couldn't wait for it to be over I'm willing to forgive a few unrealistic things in the plot of seven seasons of SUITS since the characters really popped for me .. and I got hooked. Suits is more a soap opera of the friendships and power struggles between lawyers in a firm. There are occasional court room scenes but what really hooked me is the suspense of the premise of the show .. a lawyer who never attended law school manages to get hired in a firm. There is such a thing as "reading the law" so I could easily get behind this premise. The antics that follow can sometimes bend believability but by then, you're so hooked on the characters and their relationships, it's easy to overlook. <br/><br/>The main two characters of Harvey Specter and Mike Ross are played very well by Gabriel Macht and Patrick J. Adams. But I have to say my favourite character by a long shot is Louis Litt played by Rick Hoffman. His constant battle with himself and others made me laugh out loud so many times. I was not a fan of Rachel at first ... she seemed chronically relegated to the role of a femme fatale. But she grew and took on more responsibility as the seasons rolled on. Harvey's secretary Donna, played by Sarah Rafferty, is a delight .. although (SPOILER) I doubt any firm would offer her position of COO just because she had great intuition. But this only happens in the 7th season and by then you're on board for the ride with this fun group of characters.<br/><br/>As far as anticipated season 8, Patrick J Adams and Meghan Markle are leaving but I believe Harvey Specter, Louis Litt and Donna Paulsen are returning and I definitely want to see more of Louis Litt. I think Rick Hoffman could carry his own show. Suits is a great series about lawyers, that allows people to imagine how the daily life of a important firm in NY works.<br/><br/>The two main characters are Harvey (senior partner) and Mike (an associate). Harvey tries to show Mike how to be a real lawyer, as Mike is a fraud because he pretends that he has graduated from Harvard except he is not, but he ended up working as a lawyer because of his brilliant mind. He has a photographic memory that allows him to remember everything that he reads and for this reason he convinces Harvey to hire him. So, in every episode they resolve a case and they also show their personal life.<br/><br/>The dialogue is so clever and the acting is quite good, and these two things contribute to establish solid characters. And whereas in the first season the plot focus on Mike, in the other seasons you are able to know more about Harvey and the other ones. 'Suits' is an American TV series provided by the USA Network. The storyline of this series is every situation that can happen to an actual law firm. Therefore, you will know that it is very realistic when you see this amazing series. It covers law suits, mergers, promotions, negotiations, competitions, and betrayals which occur in the law firm in New York, named Pearson Hardman. Since this firm is a first rate corporation in the city, anyone who watches this show might have a desire to get a job in this firm as I did. However, this top notch law firm also struggles against adversity such as mergers, competition, and secret outflow which is caused by employees' betrayal. It makes the series more attractive and absorbing.<br/><br/>There are two sexy and smart main characters. One is Harvey Spector who is portrayed by Gabriel Macht. He is the best lawyer and most affective person in the firm. He is a perfectionist not only about lawsuit, but also about minor things like tie color or music selection. The other is Mike Ross who is portrayed by Patrick J. Adams. He is a genius, joyful, super- rookie lawyer. He meets Harvey accidentally while running away from the policemen because He was carrying drugs. However, Harvey hires Mike because Mike knows about law as much as Harvey does. They become the best coworkers in the firm and solve complex law suits in every episode. In addition to these two main lawyers, there are many attractive characters. Donna Paulsen who is portrayed by Sarah Rafferty is Harvey's secretary. Even though she is a secretary, she is powerful than ordinary lawyers in the firm because she is the secretary of Harvey Spector. She is very pleasant and soft hearted. It makes people sympathize and cheer up this character. <br/><br/>Besides its storyline and characters,' Suits' has other interesting factors in it. As you can see in the title of the series, the characters suits are worth seeing. Their suits are sponsored by major brands such as Tom Ford. Also, Harvey and Mike have differences in their suit style. Harvey dresses up like an imposing British gentleman. On the contrary, Mike wears casual suits and shoulder back which are awkward in a law firm. Also, there are lot uses of metaphoric language. For example, Mike said that 'I have gun in my pocket' on the street, so people around him except Harvey looked at him weird. It makes people to laugh and concentrate on what is happening. Consequently, 'Suits' is a well made, fancy drama with a fine storyline and casting. It is worth to watch even if you are not interested in laws or suits because its characters are fascinating in and of itself and the well-written plot will make you fond of it. 'Suits' will shift your paradigm about TV series. Suits is about Mike Ross. Mike is a really intelligent guy with a photographic memory. when he has to sell drugs to get money and help his grandmother, he gets busted by Harvey Specter. A brilliant lawyer. Harvey offers Mike a deal to become his helper.<br/><br/>This series is amazing. It is very well acted and directed. there is, sadly enough, a love triangle. But I don't really mind, because it is well put in the story and it isn't forced in like a lot of love triangles. the script is also amazing some lines people say are just jaw dropping. I also like the humor that they put in it. And what i tought was funny is the big contrast between Harvey and Mike.<br/><br/>But this series is just EXCELLENT I totally recommend watching it. Suits is cool to watch with the Wife. Season 1 is sugar water, it will captivate your wife. Hence when the 2nd and 3rd are getting dense is already everyone hooked.<br/><br/>It does not have the Breaking Bad's characteristic "Fuck, I will watch TODAY 87 EPISODES." Piece of cake to watch only one or two episodes and maintain a normal life the rest of the day. It is easy shut down and send a "tomorrow we watch more."<br/><br/>Early in the series, each episode has an end in itself, then playing the role of a tiny little film 45 minutes. Takes place the story of the law itself and gradually life in the OFFICE.<br/><br/>Suits are not the cases, but the Firm. It is the main character and will only strongly appear throughout the series. The prevailing policy as if it were a Game of Thrones, but without Dragon, Elf, Wizard and all those other things that do not exist.<br/><br/>Get-Up Litt. I got hooked onto this series from Netflix. Acting and script really good, but the more I watched it the more I was appalled by their characterisations of the women. Every single woman in the place was clothed in designer, figure-hugging clothes and high heels. Luckily ,?, they were all slim and had small busts , otherwise the clothes would look ridiculous. They also posed continuously with designer handbags. I couldn't help wondering if the female actors were chosen to fit into the clothes the costume designer had decided they should show ( looked liked just one designer) rather than for their acting ability. Was this a TV Drama or The Runway?<br/><br/>The series is an insult to the women of corporate America. I'd give it a 10 - but in the 3rd episode, and the 4th, the background sounds (traffic noise, whatever) seems to come out of nowhere - they are talking in the conference room and suddenly there is all this street noise, like someone opened a window. It happened all through the episodes. When Mike is talking in the coffee shop, the background noise actually drowns out the voices, and I could not hear what was being said. I have a great satellite system, and have never had sound problems on programs before. Hope it can be stopped! I love the setting - Park Avenue in NYC, one of my favorite places ever - seeing the Lever Building, the Seagram Building - gives the show real class. The writing and acting is excellent. Thank You. I am always on the lookout for interesting TV shows and one of the genres, that I am fascinated with is LAW. Last time I saw something nice was , Ally Mc Beal. However, "Suits" has caught my fancy. The good looking people, the wit, the genius all comes together in a scintillating array of stories where you keep asking for more. Harvey seems too good to be true, however he is THE guy to be, always with a good presence of mind and of course surrounded by beautiful women. I liked all the episodes in the first seasons but would really want that Harvey would meet his match more often than once just so that he doesn't come across like a demi-God. I wish the second season would begin sooner. and this time they have a lot many number of episodes than the first season. Cheers! Started pretty decent with strong characters, good humour and engaging stories, unfortunately the writers seem to have run out of inspiration pretty fast and didn't wait at all to resort to ridiculously twisted plots, cheesy romance and hollow dialogue to fill the 45 minutes.<br/><br/>Season 1 and 2 are quite watchable, season 3 too but the heavy doses of soapy drama start to appear and it requires a lot of fast forwarding (at least every time Rachel & Mike are in the same room) to keep it bearable.<br/><br/>I gave up after a few episodes of season 4 as I was fast-forwarding more of the show than I was actually watching. When characters start saying stuff like "after all we've been through" and spending half their dialogues sharing their sentiments, that's a sign the point of no return has been reached and it's time to throw the towel. Just how many god dam it's do we have to hear every single episode Okay, where do I start from ? The show is absolutely brilliant. How can people say they don't like the show ? Then again I guess we all have taste right ? As soon as one episode is finished I can't wait to watch the next one. At first I didn't think that such a gender can be amusing but after just 2 episodes I couldn't not to follow. It is definitely one the drama series based on lawyers and court rooms. Though I started to watch it very lately but I was able to complete it faster than the ones who were watching it from the beginning. Because this show is so intriguing and interesting that when you plan to watch just one or two episodes you end completing one whole season. Though it has its own ups and downs. But who doesn't have it, even the greatest of shows like game of thrones faced criticism at the end. But I can assure you that if that one's you start liking it you can never get enough of it, and who knows that it can even persuade you to become a lawyer. Casting is amazing actually everything is amazing. One of the best thing about the show is Harvey Specter, I can bet he can play a lawyer better than the real world lawyers and would definitely become a fan of his charismatic personality someday. I loved the show and I can bet, sorry I hope that you would love it too. Why even bother with a season 8 if Mike is gone? Made me watch 7 series just to be disappointed on season 8 Damn seriously i made this account just to write how good this show is i definitely recommend it go for it i'm sure you won't regret it and it gives so much informations about the law and even makes you wanna be lawyer sometimes give it a try fellas no regret this show show has also a bit of romance wish i really liked a lot the cast is strongly good i'm sure they provided hell of money for this TV show the characters are regularly handsome the girls are satisfyingly hot , it has a unique storyline note that i watched hell of TV shows and this is really good sorry for long paragraph i just thought it's necessary well done overall i enjoyed it till the last episode nice work . it is not easy to understand why Suits is a great series. the subject, the acting, the script are not real different by other successful series from the last decade. it is not a phenomena and the theme is not real interesting for a large public. but it has a huge virtue - it is a smart series. the actors, the architecture of each episode, the precision of dialogs, Rick Hoffman in a delicious role, doses of sex appeal of lead team, the law as convention who defines lives in a form of "fatum" in Old Greek tragedies, the battles for a cause, the humor and the windows to sensibility in a cold battlefield, the characters who are not statues or archetypes but vulnerable people with sins who are real ordinaries, the ingredients who defines each cinema story in precise doses, all, each, are keys for the success of Suits. I enjoy the banter but Mike's and Rachael's relationship (with his ex in the mix) is getting annoying. Hopefully the show will get on track and focus on courtrooms more.<br/><br/>Unfortunately it doesn't seem it will, according to the other reviews.<br/><br/>Also, can you really fire people on the spot in US and A? Usually the only time you can fire people is if they have behaved with gross misconduct, like being drunk on work or sexual harassment. Usually people are asked to resign. <br/><br/>And don't people normally have like a three months resign period to find another job? I guess it wouldn't work in a show to fire someone and then have them sticking around for the rest of the season... I was channel hopping late one night recently, and I stumbled across a show entitled 'Suits' on the TV guide. Being a connoisseur of all things well tailored suits, I thought I'd give it a try (having never heard of it before) just to discover what the basis of the name was.<br/><br/>Being 18, law based shows have never really interested me, and I initially only continued watching because the style caught my eye. But as the first episode I witnessed progressed, (series 2, episode 8) I was hooked. I then began researching the show, and subsequently watching it from the start. The cinematography makes you get lost in the moment and leads to believe you're watching a film. The development and chemistry of each character is superb, made possible by the writers and of course the magnificent and relatively unknown cast. In fact, the only member of the lead characters I'd ever seen appear in something prior to 'Suits' was Rick Hoffman (who portrays the prickly but hilarious and eccentric Louis Litt)who had a brief cameo in Hostel.<br/><br/>The plot of each episode is enthralling and engaging, and makes you crave more episodes. It's safe to stay I'm addicted to 'Suits' having all-but finished the three seasons up to now. Give it a watch; you won't regret it.<br/><br/>Here's to late nights (and many, many more seasons of this gem of a show) A TV show which revolves around law and corporate business where every thing is fair like love and war to win, to excel, to survive, to outlaw, to defeat and last but not the least to fight for Honor and repertoire.A private firm Pearson Hardman which is the nurturing home for Harvard law cream of all graduates, run by Jessica Pearson partners as managing partner with Harvey specter and Louis lit as senior partners and associates. Mike Ross is an associate of Harvey specter. their pair is the essence, the soul and the back bone of this TV show.They are like the Batman and Robin of corporate law. suits is no doubt one of the amazing shows any one would ever see.it has all one would want to see and look forward to,if you need a personality, charm, casa nova, arrogant but caring fellow, Harvey specter is there. if you need vicious evil but yet fruitful to the society with a cause to fulfill, Luis lit helps you entertain with multi dimensions of his character from evil genius to unique deep soft touch. If you don't believe in super powers and some skills beyond human grasp, Mike Ross will make you believe with his amazing hippo campus to which every bulk of information is gullible to the extent of everlasting memory and an audacious attitude which will help him excel in this series. beauty in guise of Donna Paulson, Rachel, Scottie, Zoe and many gust stars add some eye soothing to the show. A lot of negative roles as to the charm and thrill of the show where Daniel hard-man , a former managing partner tops the list. every one in the show is important enough to make the show amazing and every role had been played to the best of it's possibilities. In nut shell, if you haven't watched suits yet, you have no right to claim you watched every good show. So contact cable guy ask for USA network and wait for Tuesday to enjoy the 42 minutes of epicness weekly. you won't regret it. Suits is the last the last thing you would want to miss. This show will survive for a long time mainly due to the perfect cast that has been chosen. The story line is excellent also, but in my honest opinion, a lot of shows get cancelled after a first season (and sometimes before) because the casting is wrong. This is certainly not the case for this show! They all fit perfectly in each other's roles and this is what makes it so good! I don't watch a lot of TV series on a regular basis, but this one is on my top priority because of this amazing dynamics between all characters.<br/><br/>If you haven't watched an episode yet, do yourself a favour and do so, you will see what I mean. Well, after watching and following this great Legal series, I became addicted to it. such an intelligent and smart scenarios, great characters, and adequate actors and actresses, especially Gabriel Macht and Patrick Adams and the funny Rick Hoffman. Actually, I like most of the legal dramas, like Boston Legal and good wife and Ally Mcbeal, and this series is among the best series ever shown on TV. Hope there will be some many other seasons, because this show deserves to be extended. Thanks for all the crew who worked on this series and made it a success. Although the new partner who appeared in the second season David Costabile didn't have any new influence on the show, but he's OK. One more point to add, this show makes me like lawyers and proves that lawyers are always right and are so smart, which pushes me to be a lawyer... such a very important profession and career. Thanks again for this great show. Suits is a well entertaining and extremely addictive series with the best drama I have ever seen. Till the mid season break this series has delivered extremely well and the twist and turns and spice bomb exploding in every episode always keeps me glued to the screen.I think this series can live well to anyone's expectations. But slow people aren't advised watch this cause you won't get it. Thought they try to maintain brevity on their legal side of the story but still you to do some brain work while you are watching it. So if anyone dislike this series...its plain and simple, they can't cope up with the technicality and jargon used most of the time. All in all, watch the pilot and maybe a one or two episodes more after that, if required, and judge it yourself...i bet u won't regret spending time trying this TV series out. I absolutely love this series. It breathes new life into the lawyer TV series and turned it into something new. Kudos to the creator, director, writers cast and crew. I have only one criticism for this series. It would be nice if there were more budget for production. The conference room looks as though it was furnished from Ikea, the lawyer office designs are not creative and are unremarkable. Boston Legal had an incredible set designer. I believed that this was a high- powered law firm because I could see the money in the set production, the on-location scenes, I even "believed" that the two main characters met nightly on the roof top for drinks and conversation. Suits does not make me believe that this is a high-powered law firm because I don't see the money in the set designs or the attention to detail. I will continue to watch it because it's a great series, but hoping there will be an "office" move to higher digs before the series ends. Since the end of House M.D I've been looking for something to put the excitement back into TV. After countless hours of mediocre television viewing, by utter chance I stumbled across this brilliant show.<br/><br/>I would first like to say I'm not the biggest fan of law based shows.<br/><br/>Reading some reviews people are quickly branding this as 'unrealistic', all I want to say is this isn't a documentary. Its a clever interpretation of what life would be like in a law firm. To be fair law is interesting but boring.<br/><br/>What suits does is lift a dry genre into a fun, clever show filled with Witt, sarcasm and uniquely brilliant characters.<br/><br/>The show is about more than law...its a drama of choices, the good, the bad and naive ones.<br/><br/>What makes this appeal to me is that although certain characters are stereotyped as the bad guys, its the morally ambiguous decisions of good guys that catch you off guard.<br/><br/>You find yourself rooting for one character and while your mate sitting next is rooting for another. I have to give so much credit to the writers of this show, this is genius. You feel the ups and downs of the characters lives. <br/><br/>Suits is an emotionally engaging show; the pilot episode set the standard and since then its been going from strength to strength.<br/><br/>To put this in perspective I just wanna explain the best bits.<br/><br/>ACTING : The actors & actresses were all well chosen, each person FITS their role perfectly. The leads are amazing and the supporting cast really step it up. I hate using this term but you can feel the "chemistry" between certain actors. 10/10<br/><br/>SCRIPT : Its gold, has a hint of sophistication, while been simultaneously fresh and comedic. 10/10<br/><br/>DIALOGUES : Well written, and always engaging. 10/10<br/><br/>SCREENPLAY : Very well rounded, although some episodes in focus away from the law side and become a bit too character centric.<br/><br/>OVERALL : 2 Seasons and counting: 9.5/10 This is my favorite show and I've seen Sherlock, Doctor Who, the Walking Dead, Falling Skies, the Office, etc. This show show's that you don't need to have explosions, zombie guts, alien invasions, or a unique enviorment(Doctor Who). It shows that story still matters. This show isn't a show that adds onto the story in the last three minutes. Every second of every episode is complete story. And it's an intriguing story. Aside from the story is the acting. I honestly haven't seen such fantastic acting since Heath Ledger as Joker. R.I.P I only have two gripes, under advertised, and too much cursing in second season. It would've gotten a ten, but saying s**t every three minutes can get a little annoying. As if I don't hear enough of that at school.<br/><br/>This show is amazing. And every episode isn't like "it was OK". Every episode is amazing. USA Network really hit their grand slam (with Covert Affairs hitting a single, Burn Notice, a double, and White Collar, a triple). This show is amazing and delightful and the best out there. Each episode builds and the overall show satisfies. Do your self a favor and watch it. This pilot was interesting and amusing, if somewhat unbelievable in how easy some pieces fall into place. For instance, how easily Mike and Harvey's lives suddenly intertwine and play off each other.<br/><br/>The characters are very watchable, but rather than let viewers learn about them ourselves, everything is spelled out for us; perhaps it's one of his characteristics of observation, but Mike is constantly pointing out his and other characters' traits.<br/><br/>Despite those downfalls, the episode was entertaining, and I'm curious to see where it goes from here. I hope this show can build on the pilot, and not turn into another let down! If they could reproduce the whole Seasons again without Rachel being played by this actress, I would personally suggest they do that. Utterly immature dialogues/scrioots/acting<br/><br/>a lot of arrogance and not serious or convincing characters.<br/><br/>and especially Markle, freally clouldnt see what all the fuss is about..... total rubbish<br/><br/>ditching it after only 37mins into it, out of it Get that horrible Louis Little out of the program - that jerk is despicable. ðŸ˜„ I watched almost all the seasons. In the beginning it made sense. Solving cases, helping the corporate clients. A good drama to pass the time. Now it's gotten worse. The script lacks maturity & the characters are always in your face. The dialogue is amateurish. Overall, the series is good as a novelty, which is why I watched first few seasons. Then it just gets boring & repetitive. Also, find a bit less dramatic music! A music that you use for a catastrophe like dissolution of the firm is the same music you use for firing an associate? Doesn't make much sense.
Overall: good as a novelty. Should've ended with 3rd-4th season. This might've been a good comedy too, like Brooklyn nine nine. They shot it too high up. Now it just sucks. Great start for the series but a bad ending. You can only take all that yelling for so long. Mike was the kickoff yeller, storming into a room and eye balls a popping and yelling at someone, usually at Harvey. Emergencies every episode, unsolvable, until they were solved. Then when Megham Marples left the show and seemed to drag Mike Ross with her for the most part, along comes ole yeller Samantha to fill in the dead space. The most disappointing part to me was the closure to Harvey's and Donna's relationship. Epic fail. Not believable that they were in love with each other - did not pass that test, at all. By the end I wanted to smack Donna's smirk off her stupid face. Just too much. A friend of mine is a fan of this show, and encouraged me to binge watch it. The first season the show was intelligent, and interesting. The second season wasn't as good as the first, but was enough to keep going. It all went downhill from there. The writing became more and more sloppy, and the characters became less and less likeable with time, instead of showing any actual growth. The most recent season of the show? Don't even bother.<br/><br/>I honestly think they were deliberately trying to kill this show season by season. It's stylized to be like a "Mad Men" type of show, but on "Mad Men" the characters (mostly) evolved with time. Here, the majority regress until they seem like cardboard cutouts, instead of actual characters. Louis and Donna are the only decent characters, the rest are throwaways- and I like Gina Torres! I blame the writers. I think they got lazy after the first two seasons. I was browsing through Netflix and this show caught my attention. Wasn't expecting much. The pilot episode got me hooked onto the show and before i knew it I had finished watching the entire 6 seasons within 2 months! In spite of a busy schedule. I would rate it better than GOT or breaking bad. The dialogues,acting,story line, dressing sense are simply superb. I sometimes wish I had studied law(just over exaggerating). However, this show really inspired me to develop my personality. I just love the way Harvey delivers his dialogues and I sometimes try to implement them while getting into any confrontation. This show is simply awesome. I hope it never ends. I have seen so many articles and videos of what you should do to become Harvey Specter - a real man, a king of the mountain. Are his steps indeed worth following? With these thoughts I've decided to check out this new series and within several minutes I was hooked up like a fish chewing on a juicy worm.<br/><br/>One might wonder why there are so many incredible characters? A simple answer is - it is fiction. However, we should also take into the account that all main figures on the board are "from Harvard", so they should be a good as they come...Anyways, for me the show is like a gulp of fresh air from all the usual sitcoms and detectives. This time it's a story of a law firm, even though it's connected with serving justice guns aren't blazing and doors are kept intact.<br/><br/>I shall immediately prevent you from thinking: "Oh, then it might be very boring!". Not at all! Apparently connections, intrigues and old promises play huge part in doing law for a living. Don't get me wrong - knowledge and book-worming is like 90% of success, but it is masterfully concealed with a cloth of fun.<br/><br/>The characters are loveable from the first sight. They are not ideal, but I bet you will want to get a piece of everybody once you've seen them. Gabriel Macht did an outstanding job by giving us an icon of a man, although even best of us have their weaknesses. Sarah Rafferty, who plays Donna - in my opinion is one of the most powerful female characters of recent times. And finally, the wildcard of the whole show - Patrick J. Adams who makes an incredible duo with Gabriel Macht.<br/><br/>In the end these three are the core of the series in my opinion. You root for them like there is no other in your sight. Supporting actors around them are nonetheless outstanding performers turning the emotions to the max.<br/><br/>In the end, I strongly recommend you to watch this classy show with a story worth of your time, superb music and a style that will knock out your inner slob. I like this show it's special one I love harfey I love the bl is my favorite day This was my first legal - Corporate Drama and I fell in love with it. I than stumbled across Designated Survivor, which is a Political - Legal drama, which I am in fond of.<br/><br/>Aside from my favorability of the films, I really enjoyed the film's impact on my intellectual understanding of business and the law. I'm so sad that it's coming to its last season, but I believe it's completely necessary. 9 seasons... definitely time to pull the plug. I wouldn't want it to become an over - rated film series like Grays Anatomy. It's great show I like dona she is the best one of them and reachel is very beautiful I like her and she's relationship with mile After wrapping up 4 seasons in less than a month and procrastinating my uni work for the show... I am proud to say that this show's been added to my all time favorite tv show list! A show with an insanely good storyline, a crazy character build ups, and just the right amount of humor? Deserves all the awards it can get! I am OBSESSED about New York, Pearson, Specter and EVERYTHING Suits related! Love this show!! Donna is brilliant! I like the evolution of Harvey's character and the chemistry with Mike along their journey. I miss Mike!! This show has it all (spoiler: no vampires or drug cartels; sorry); interesting story lines, witty dialog, and perfect chemistry with the actors. It's never sappy or melodramatic, as so many network shows are, and just plain fun to watch. Is it possible to have a 'love affair' with a television program ? This, coming from a person who recently discovered accessing full season TV series and who hasn't watched cable or even network TV in over 15 years. That feeling of looking forward to the weekly episode of my favorite sit-com, cliff-hanger, or melodrama has been a vague nostalgic memory for quite a while now.<br/><br/>Recently giving "dropped" whole seasons to watch, a chance via the various TV access platforms now available, I've discovered shows like The Path, Leftovers, Westworld, The Handmaidens Tale, Humans, Under the Dome, Manifest, and SUITS. I'm near the end of Season 4 and though it could eventually run out of steam and become redundant, it hasn't yet. The characters are incredible. They're relatable, I root for them, I hate them, I love them, and seemingly can't get enough of them. I do not recall a series with writing so intelligent yet grounded, lineal yet interchangeable, and raw yet still classy. The way the story line is foundationally built around the depth of the characters and every previous script writing, connecting episode upon episode and season upon season is exceptional and rare. It's like an Avengers movie culminating the Marvel Cinematic Universe in just about every episode.<br/><br/>Seeing as this show is running in it's 8th Season, I imagine it may eventually stray from its roots, evolve into something else, or lose its creativity, so I'll revisit this when I catch up and get current. Though at this point it's an all-time great obsession forming attraction. I liken it to a love affair due to the emotional attachment and investment as well as the fear of it ending. It's probably the easiest and deserving 10 out of 10 I'll ever drop. I am at the end of the
5th season. used to love this show. but this end is pathetic. First 7 seasons are great, then season 8 happened and the usual happens, you know the drill. Strong, masculine indipendent female is supposed to be the same as Harvey. But in reality she is just a rude as*hole, with no charisma. Harvey is smart, has charisma and bend the rules, nothing mirrored by the female character. They try to make out be the same kind of person but just different genders. <br/><br/>Her first scene is she obviously practising a masculine sport to show how tough she is, and the feminist fails already since a man practising a feminine sport to show how weak (I guess) he is, that's how feminist sees it that way, since its never a female doing a feminine sport will not have the same effect as they think it would. So its already not any sign of equality. <br/><br/>Then they went over how people have to be fired and everything was set to a standard and of course the man didn't live up to the expectations. Very predictable. 
The new female character also had time to bring up skin color, I think it was just 15 minutes in to her first episode. <br/><br/>No regrets for watching the first 7 seasons, it was a blast. Now they threw it down the toilet, like most movies and tv shows that came out after 2014. Definitely one of the better shows I have ever watched. It had me from the first episode and I'm absolutely in love with Suits. Amazing actors, it's clever, entertaining, sophisticated with some funny lines here and there. Just overall great work with great quality of actors, writers and directors. 10/10 would definitely recommend this show! Amazingly well written and acted series. I could Niger imagine corporate lawyers' stories were this interesting This is the best series I've watched. I've only watched it twice for now but will return in the future. I love the personalities, and how it everything works so well in every episode (except the last one 'goodbye' sadly.)
I can only recommend this to everyone, watch two episodes - if you like it just a bit you will love it, as the characters are so well-thought and you only can love them aswell.
So if you are up for laughs and drama.. watch it!
----EDIT----
So happy they made season 8 and 9, the show truly got the ending it deserved, I will miss this show so much!
11 stars.. This is a terrific show. It's intelligently written with great dialogue and witty retorts between characters. Ok, so it's a little over the top with the quick cutting comments, but still fun to watch. <br/><br/>I would have given this a "ten" but for the excessive time given to the relationship between Mike and Rachel which after a while gets a little tedious. Good acting
Poor costume design
Poor hair
Writing mostly good, but a tad glib with repetitive phrasing To me, "Suits" is an unsung hero type of movie. It is way way way over the top with cliché and stereotype. If I try to watch in a literal frame of mind, I am going "Oh, no." When I open to thinking this show is not taking ITSELF seriously, then I am just overwhelmed by the quality. It is to me kind of like a version of Mel Brooks' "Young Dr. Frankenstein." You aren't horrified, but you soon realize your jaw is hanging open. Suits has been going for years, but I never bought into it. I love legal stories but the theme of this series is not about court cases and legal battles.<br/><br/>Then a certain royalty became interested in an actress featuring in Suits which came to my attention. I decided to take a bite into Suits.<br/><br/>Well my opinion had been correct from the start. Suits is not about court cases or legal battles, but more like a soapy. It is a fair series but getting hooked on it is another matter altogether. I got as far as season 2 episode 3 when I diversified into watching something more interesting.<br/><br/>Will I complete watching the series? Sure, when I really have nothing better to do! A rating of 6 out of 10 is the best I can offer. Suits is a modern, stylish take on the lawyering world based in NYC. Both the cast and set compliment each other extremely well, constantly evolving with the topsy terby storyline. A tail of deception, lies and betrayal it's a must watch for anyone looking for hard hitting drama. An enormously talented cast and crew, with both strong male and female characters keeps the audience on there toes and the future of "the firm" in the balance. With a new tail waiting at every corner, Suits is by far the most gripping TV series to come to our shore from the US since Entourage. Cant't wait for season 7. I first started watching this amazing series in the summer of 2015 and I got so caught up in it I watched all the 5 seasons that were available at the time in 5 days, I wasn't doing anything else except eating and drinking and of course watching suits. Now, at the end of season 6 I decided it's time to express my feelings about this series, it has been one wild adventure so far, filled with tears and joy, the acting was absolutely fantastic making you feel like you know them and they know to a point where you actually care for them as they were your family which so far is one of the greatest things that a series has ever achieved in my opinion. The soundtrack is perfectly chosen with touching songs for every situation which also amplifies the intensity at which you experience the show to such an extent that it becomes part of you. Now that season 6 has ended I can definitely say this show has come far both the story and characters have evolved in a wonderful way and it keeps getting better. If you're asking the question ,,Should I start watching suits?,, I can assure you that the answer is eyes, you are definitely going to enjoy it, on the other hand I can't assure you that you're going to love it as much as I do but it's definitely worth watching. I would make a review about season 6 (1-10) since I have finished watching it. Finally! That is the perfect word for this season since everything go back to its original plot (season 1 and 2) where Harvey is as strong as ever not some emotional distraught brainless lawyer like season 5 did (pure disappointment for that season), Mike stays on his track with honesty and still smart ass guy (forgive the language) but really even though he did not get to become a lawyer again "soon" he still a big help for those who needs his help, Louis becomes Louis still some bad temper love hunger weird guy but this season he was not cunning or even did dirty tricks like former seasons which I really prefer, Rachel showing more of her humane/emotional side which is OK but not really likable, finally Donna act like a super secretary unlike a secretary who got angry when her feeling was not reciprocated by her boss then left to work for others (a betrayer I suppose) it's good for the production team to keep Donna-Harvey thing as professional love just gonna ruin the show.<br/><br/>So this season is finally not as boring like season 3, 4, 5 not too dramatic importantly and focusing in solving law cases of course with clever ways instead of dealing with inside law-firm conflict, personal problems of those working in the firm, anger-management and insecurity issues (not only with Harvey but almost everyone in the show). Gladly see this show's improvement "FINALLY". it has rhythm, force and a splendid script.it is an admirable web, part of a new different TV series wave. it has the gift to be always, episode by episode, a surprise. for acting and for links between characters, for humor and for references, for the trip in a universe who becomes more and more fascinating. a film about law but, in same measure, about vulnerabilities. so, a great series. amazing for its freshness and clever solutions, for Patrick J. Adams and for the demonstration of Gabriel Macht talent. a film with precise dose of darkness and ambiguity who has the virtue to be real alive. and that is the important thing for transform its success in certitude. I have to admit that I was almost depressed when I watched the last episode. Not because it wasn't great, but because there were no more.<br/><br/>The characters are great. A lot of fun. A good drama without too much soap/cheese. There were only a couple times when I thought "That scene didn't quite work". Bravo to the Directors & Actors.<br/><br/>Very pleased to know that that the show is reconvening production. My girlfriend and I were watching 2-3 episodes a night.<br/><br/>Looking forward to seeing how it progresses. I love the show. My guess would be that Jessica & Harvey will eventually end up together. That will be the very last episode of this great show. Congratulations everyone involved with the show...<br/><br/>This is not really a spoiler for those you watch a lot films & TV. I just wanted to protect myself in case someone got upset and reported me. My apology for anyone who might have been misled. <br/><br/>Have a great day! simply awesome acting, dressing and storyline, I think Ross and Donna became my best actors right now!, they are amazing... I really liked the way they preview New York city it makes me feel jealous as I live in Giza,Egypt :( I think they good took care of everything, I didn't notice a single bad thing, the people who made that TV show are so professional and didn't let anything effect their great work the theme song is really good I liked a lot as so many thing in that show which I watched by chance while I ran out of everything to be watched then I found myself their in Ross's life and made me forced to type an article to describe my love to that show while my English is SO bad Excellent TV show. I watch a lot and Suits was recommended by a friend so I watched the pilot episode. Haven't stopped watching since. In under 2 weeks I watched all episodes and am now waiting for season three to be released. <br/><br/>The only problem you may have is that the show moves at quite a high pace something I personally find a great positive about it. Nothing in the show is hard to follow but you are expected to leave or forget about certain aspects of an episode in order to get more information on other areas. This may be a problem if you aren't able to be left on a knife edge, but in every episode each part of the episode has importance to the whole thing. <br/><br/>Harvey Specter is a character most people will truly come to love as he portrays the confidence bordering on arrogance that makes he admired by so many. <br/><br/>The whole concept for the show is a fantastic idea, certainly watch the first episode and make your own mind though.<br/><br/>Having watched shows such as Scrubs, How I met your Mother, Family Guy, Hustle, Prison Break and a lot of others I can safely say this is the best along with Scrubs. I had been looking for a show that contains all the ingredients that this show has - court room drama, wit, colorful characters and a script that is believable. I myself work in a corporate environment and I assure you that the competition out there is cut throat. I have seen them all - backstabbing colleagues, managers that will do anything to get you to do their work by dangling a carrot in front of you, people like Harvey Specter who might on the exterior appear to be hard asses but in fact are people who want to do the right thing. People may lambaste this show for the acting saying that some of the main characters have not given their 100 percent. Well I am from a theatrical background and work as a critic for a local daily so take it in writing from me that the acting is not sub par. I hate it when people overact and the actors in this show do not do that. The premises in each episode are believable, the witty banter that goes around does happen for real (if you're working in an office full of smart asses). Hats off to Rick Hoffman there are times when he steals the scene with his histrionics. The chemistry between the lead characters of Mike Ross and Harvey Specter is amazing and so is the chemistry that they share with other characters such as Donna the secretary and Rachel the paralegal. My only grouse is that sometimes the subplots concerning the relationships that they have is distracting and unnecessary but all is forgiven in light of the excellent dialog and oneupmanship that ensues. I highly recommend this show.. don't let anybody convince you otherwise.. One of the best legal dramas I have seen. I caught it by accident and was hooked straight away, now I don't miss an episode.<br/><br/>Series 1 was good, series 2 was even better, can't wait for series 3.<br/><br/>The characters have flaws like most of us; this makes them believable and likable. The pace makes the 45 minutes (without commercial brakes) flyby.<br/><br/>I think this show will make the university's law courses more popular, like CSI made more people want to study forensics.<br/><br/>Good stories, well written and a good cast make it a winner. Watch it you won't regret it. I wasn't expecting much. Another show about lawyers. In New York. Yay.<br/><br/>And for the first episode things went more or less predictably. The snarky super lawyer, the bright but naive understudy, the power female executive, and the thoroughly evil office Darth Vader (Louis!).<br/><br/>The lead characters - Harvey and Mike - kind of carry the show for the first half season but then the ensemble cast takes over. I watched this marathon fashion since I'd never seen it before and by the time I got to the middle of the second season I felt like fast-forwarding past the Harvey-and-Mike scenes. Their roles are kind of predictable after a while - you pretty much know they'll hit some roadblock and at the last minute they'll have this amazing idea and win the case. Feels kind of like House in that regard.<br/><br/>Donna (Harvey's legal secretary) is incredible. Smart, funny, complex. Every scene with her is interesting. Rachel is gorgeous and has an infectious smile and laugh - a bit of a drama queen, but so what - she's fun to watch and carries her role very well. Louis is a tour de force - you at once can't stand him and a second later feel bad for him - a thoroughly damaged human being that combines an Arthurian sense of justice with the people skills of Josef Stalin. <br/><br/>It helps that the head writer comes from a comedy background. This show would not work as a straight-up drama. What makes it immensely watchable is the humor that every character brings to their roles. No matter how heavy the plot-line is, there's always a scene or two - usually with Donna or Louis - that are comedy gold.<br/><br/>I gave it an 8 because it's fun to watch, but the show needs to be careful of becoming too formulaic and predictable. When the tertiary characters start stealing the show on a weekly basis, that says something is wrong. Harvey, Mike, and Jessica are almost caricatures by the end of the second season. There are no surprises from them. The constant focus on internal office politics and attempts to take control of the firm likewise gets tedious after a while. They should focus more on cases. <br/><br/>But overall this is a pretty good show and worth watching. Ever since I saw the very first episode of the show I've been hooked! I find the whole idea of having Harvey and Mike in a father son relationship(metaphorically speaking) to be interesting and enjoyable. Along the same lines I also like how Harvey started out being someone Mike couldn't really relate or get on with but as Mike got to know him and learnt a lot of things off him started to idolise and aspire to be the next Harvey. I think it's a situation many of us can relate to with family relationships and other situations such as work with managers etc. I'd love to see more about Harveys past and just what exactly it is they do with the tin opener, the mystery's started to get tiresome and worn out now in my opinion. My favorite show since Firefly, Suits has two things that a good show requires: good characters and good dialog.<br/><br/>The characters are likable, interesting and well-developed. Even Louis, the arch nemesis of lead characters Harvey and Mike, is sympathetic in his own way. The female leads are multi-dimensional and powerful, which also makes the male/female relationships interesting. The boss of the firm is a black female (the amazing Gina Torres, also a Firefly alum).<br/><br/>The dialog is quick and intelligent. The pop references and wordplay go by so quickly, you need to listen carefully to not miss them, but I like that in a show.<br/><br/>The show contains real drama and conflict, yet I find myself laughing out loud during each episode. This is excellent writing. There are story arcs within each episode and extending over multiple episodes.<br/><br/>The legal cases they deal with provide ethical and moral dilemmas for the characters to negotiate. The characters resolve these issues in different ways, depending upon their experiences and viewpoints, often struggling with their views of justice and responsibility--to the firm and to the client.<br/><br/>A "10" from me.<br/><br/>Addendum: More than a year after my original review, this is my favorite show. I just watched the first episode of the new season, and the writing has not lagged. This show is a real joy! This program I actually tried to dislike. It had nothing for me. I do not (normally) like lawyer shows or doctor shows. Rarely are they accurate and rarely do they portray real people. 'Suits' was not what I expected. This program is witty and well paced. The show is more about conflicting personalities than law. One thing I like in a show is a good set of personality clashes. Mike and Harvey are always scrapping with one another. Threats fly between the two but you know they will manage to settle their differences by the end of the episode. Of course - if that is not enough, Rachel and Paulsen will get into the mix with sharpened claws. Fur flies when these two mingle (and that is not a dancing type mingle either.) I know what you are saying, 'Isn't this enough?' Oh no it is notfar from it. The absolute best antagonist (and the one who really makes the show worth watching) has got to be Louis. The man is like watching a pit viper waiting to strike or a volcano readying itself to blow its topyou just know it will happenand when it doesit is purely magnificent. I wish Mr. Hoffman had more of an impact on the show. He is like the guy reaching into your chest cavityfingers mulling around for a bit, and finally grabbing onto your heart and yanking that baby out of its nest of supposed safety. Oh - and do you think that would please this characterno way. He would need to show you your muscle of life and mock you with it. Rick Hoffman is awesome. With all this nasty chitchat one would there would be nothing left of the firm. Let's face it this whole law office is like a bunch of ruthless kids looking to outdo the next guy, at any cost. Lucky for these adult children there is a parent in the room and that parent is Mom-lawyer. Played by Gina Torres she is the consummate peace maker. Obviously she has her favorites, but that does not flaw her judgment. She also knows very well who is valuable and who is not. Jessica is needed to tame the sharks in high-heels and three-pieced suits. When the storm kettle kicks up beyond the notch of no returnPearson steps in and with a wave her hand and storm clouds dissipate. This show has paceI like it. Sofar I watch the first Pilot episode.<br/><br/>This screen writing has points where you as viewer will add sayings at parts, At one time especially where your inner voice will add to the script.<br/><br/>Its so very well made that I believe its meant for the viewer to add this from the back of your mind but its not avious.<br/><br/>I doupth it but it could also be a miss in the script but not lightly.<br/><br/>At least not for a Pilot Episode.<br/><br/>The series has lots of Energy, very good characters of various kinds.<br/><br/>Now the base Topic, For people when outside of the living room sofa, these types of people are hurting people and makes lots of money of it and I am not sure it is good that it is displayed in a glamored way.<br/><br/>There is a real world with real living people.<br/><br/>After now watched 6 episodes, this becomes pretty lame.<br/><br/>Im not looking forward to watch episode 7. Altrogh the show is very unrealistic and real lawyers will hate to watch and.... for anyone who's not a lawyer
I personally never really liked legal drama i found the genre to be dull too emotional and empty basicly
i must say that suit's just makes it work just... so interesting and well made that i actually watched it and it was amazing... i highly recogmend you'd watch it too -no much else to say I have watched this show since the begining... however the language has gotten more and more crude! Clean it up already... This show had some of the best characters on TV. Harvey, Donna, Lewis, Mike, Rachel, Jessica, were incredible. They later added Katrina, Zane, Alex, Gretchen & Sam. Also awesome.<br/><br/>Nearly every season was outta the park great, and the ones that werent were still an inside the park triple play.<br/><br/>BUT!!!!!<br/><br/>That series finally was....HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>It was rushed, disjointed, confusing and honestly sub-par for this show in every way.<br/><br/>1). How Harvey got Faye to back off? Never explained.
2). The 2 weddings? Rushed
3). No cameo by Rachel (understandable)
4). No cameo by Jessica. (Unforgivable)
5). After fighting to keep the firm, Jessica & Harvey walk away with barely a moments thought???? SERIOUSLY!!!!!
6). The hospital thing? Forced, rushed, pointless.<br/><br/>In short.<br/><br/>Game of thrones had a better series finale, and that's NOT a compliment.<br/><br/>I give it nine stars for what it was, but you lost a star for the complete pile of crap you made of your final episode. I first found this television series in 2016. I fell in love with the Show. I made sure to watch the entire television series. I am indifferent of the ending. Not sad, nor am I happy. Just content with the outcome of the show. It was good nor bad. There was nothing I can complain about, and would like to complain about. I definitely love the television show.<br/><br/>Definitely recommend the tv series, but it is a little long. I admit to that. approximately a total of 90hrs of watch time for all 9 seasons. It's been 8 years since i started watching this series and it has gotten better and better over the years,
Some shows you just watch to see what happens and some shows like suits you watch and love and live with moment by moment till the end... I wish I can give this a 100! Harvey Specter is the hottest, smartest, sexist and cleverest guy you'll ever come across IMO.<br/><br/>Clever scripts, Louis Litts' tantrums and comedy outbursts.... watch this and you'll never be disappointed!<br/><br/>It has ended but I'm watching the whole thing again as I'm that obsessed! In the world of harvey specter & mike ross i wanna be Louis litt. This character shows us how to be unique in your own way. Don't follow the world. Gabriel and Rick are exceptional. Their characters blend well with the script and their acting is exceptional. The script is fantastic too & across all seasons it makes sure to keep the audience entertained and wanting more of this!<br/><br/>Must one time watch! I started to binge the show when I learned that season 9 was its last. I hate waiting week to week, especially when the show is so good. What I have loved about "Suits" is the dynamic characters. It's been entertaining watching the characters evolve, especially Harvey and Louis. Both characters are played so well, just illustrating the actors' talents. The interaction between the characters is also enjoyable. I am also pleased that the show finally brought Harvey and Donna together. By binging the show, I didn't have to wait 8 years for it to finally happen. I know many people complain about how there are flaws in the way that the law is portrayed, but I'm no lawyer. And honestly, I don't watch it for the law, I watch it to be entertained. I have been entertained and it's not about the cases. This show is very intelligent, not slow, and very interesting. Wish more shows held my attention like this one does. Wish it could stay on air forever. Love the relationships and characters. Excellent writing. I absolutely love this show and the conversation lines. Very addictive show...you always want to watch more Suits' story writing and great casting of characters made this show for us. I was initially reluctant to watch a show where the main character (Harvey) is spun as an arrogant, win everytime lawyer. I will admit, he and the show, won me over, and that of my husband when I recommended he give it a try. It's serious law firm drama, whether realistic or not, peppered with lighthearted humor throughout. There's always a chuckle here and there.<br/><br/>The characters are exceptionally cast! Harvey is the rock, Mike as his right had man, Jessica the boss, Louis Litt with his range of expressions, whose an incredibly smart a lawyer dominated and hijacked by his emotions, and Donna, Harvey's assistant, are, in my opinion, standouts. Actually, all the characters are well written and well acted, all very strong personalities with a no back down attitude in what is portrayed as a highly successful law firm. I also love Sheila Sazs as Louis' girlfriend - what chemistry and what a match for Louis! Even Gretchen's character is awesome and refreshing - Donna is irreplaceable, but I felt it smart of the writers to have an entirely different character play her part as Harvey's temporary assistant. Forstman (Eric Roberts) as a villain is perfect, along with the slimy Hardman.<br/><br/>We're into season 5, and just when you think they couldn't possibly come up with more tension or story line without repeating itself, they come through again and again. I definitely recommend this show for those of you who enjoy law firm drama/tension and, at times, hilarious humor. Kudos to the writers and the casting! Average show not bad at all, go watch it give it a change Both Patrick J Adams & Lisa Torres are absolutely terrible actors. The reviews on Suit were what brought me to watch the series but those two actors brought the series down. Maybe Torres should keep with singing & Adams just give up acting. Suits is currently one of the best show on TV, with it's witty script, story, relationships, etc. etc. (watch it for yourself) When announced that 2 main characters are leaving the show at the end of season 7, it worried me if the show can keep up with it's magic. <br/><br/>6 episodes now in Season 8 and it hasn't disappointed me a bit. Yes, we all miss Mike and Rachel, but allowing more air time for all the other charming and distinctive characters in the show, developing the bond in the firm truly hooked me in the show even more. <br/><br/>This review is not to explain how good the show is, but just a piece to express that even with the loss of 2 of my favorite characters, this show has lived up to its expectations. <br/><br/>I find myself with a smile at the end of each episode for this season.<br/><br/>Watch it if you haven't already. Legal drama at its best
Plots and schemes are all over to make life at a law firm interesting. I have watched every season. Aaron Korsh has done a great job at keeping you on the edge of your seat for the entire episode. The intrinsic bond that is created between each character is extremely unique in nature. The show is totally with a binge! Love this show and can't wait until next season! The cast and the story line is amazing!!! Keeps getting better each season! I loved this. It was a perfect balance between romance and well work! Great acting and very entertaining. Very well put together and is always very interesting. There hasn't been a point where I've gotten bored or wanted to stop watching. I love this TV series. There is always a suspense ... and every ends of the show always puts us in an appetite to see the continuation of Suits. Among others (all of which are important in their role), the writers and directors are among the masters who make the success of this series.<br/><br/>But among the main characters, I would like to specify which are my favorites in order:<br/><br/>1- Louis 2- Donna 3- Harvey 4- Mike 5- Jessica 6- Rachel<br/><br/>And you? Who are your favorite characters in your order?<br/><br/>Mario, from MontrÃ©al Suits is an amazing series, well-chalked story. Hats off to everyone from Suits team. Gabriel Macht, Patrick J. Adams, Sarah Rafferty, Gina Torres, Meghan Markle and last but not the least Rick Hoffman amazing actors. <br/><br/>Starting 2-3 seasons were just fabulous, 5 & 6 season was flat and had lost its charm. But brilliant come back in the second part of Season 6; a stupendous ending for season 6, where Mike Ross gets into the BAR. Litt is the most versatile actor. Best pair Gabriel and Patrick.<br/><br/>Love the Patrick and Meghan love story though. Can't wait for season 7 to begin. This TV show started out amazing in the beginning and was exciting throughout which isn't something many TV shows do nowadays. Love the characters and the atmosphere it creates. Very fun and invigorating play by the cast. I really hope that this TV show doesn't stop. I hope they come up with amazing twists in the story line and keep audience interested with new OMG reactions. Certain characters in the TV show are really taken to their extremes which also happens in real life and it's quite amazing how they handle themselves in those situations. Some of those reactions aren't exactly how it actually happens in real life but heck, it's a TV show after all which has to be entertaining enough. When it comes to TV shows I am very picky on what I tend to stick with, what I will say is 10 minutes into the pilot of Suits I was hooked!<br/><br/>The setting is Manhattan,NY to which I feel that city just has something magical about it and makes an awesome backdrop with the hustle and bustle, general ambiance of the city, it would make a great setting for any TV show.<br/><br/>None the less the thing for me that makes Suits great are simple.<br/><br/>The premise of the show - A young college drop out Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams) caught in the middle of a drug set-up lands a job working as a Lawyer at a high powered Law firm in New York city with one of the most powerful Lawyers in the state Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht) all the while remembering that...well he never went to Law School. <br/><br/>While working in the firm Mike being constantly under suspicion by Junior Partner Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman) and Managing Partner Jessica Pearson (Gina Torres) keeps you grasped with the level of suspense and makes for some very interesting twists and turns along the way as well.<br/><br/>The other thing that make Suits great for me is the cast. Mentioned above in captions Gabriel Macht and Patrick J. Adams work great together on screen as Harvey and Mike, but they also have a brilliant chemistry with every other member on screen as well which keeps it fresh and funny to watch at the same time.<br/><br/>All I can say in summing up is that you don't really have anything to lose by giving it a chance. if you love interesting characters, plot lines, and great acting then you will love Suits! I know it's a bit too much to say, this is the best show ever, but it really is. Episodes are perfect length, unlike most other TV shows, episodes don't finish with a pathetic cut, hoping you will watch the next episode, where you get the same thing again. With this show, each episode is full of brilliant stories and always a great few in the background. At the end of each episode, you feel like you just watched a great movie! It is intelligent, there is no rubbish, the scenes are set perfectly, it is most easy on the eye, the acting is superb by each and every person on the show. Lead characters should be nominated for every award going and win them. Do you know why? because they make you feel for them, you get happy with them, you get angry with them, you get sad with them, it is incredible! I wish I was good at articulating my thoughts which are always too fast for my typing... but I hope you get the idea.. Well done all!! I'm watching the series on Netflix after its run on network TV. Through six seasons there was mild swearing but this season seven seems to have taken it to the next level of swearing! Do they want an R rating? Totally unnecessary! The problem I have with the show is all the characters are cardboard, one dimensional and boring, completely self absorbed and honestly nasty people. I honestly don't like anybody on this show, it is full of horrible, mean, condescending people. Louis is probably the most interesting and has many layers but he is a laughable bold guy that everyone are making a joke of. The worst are Mike and the main boss Jessica. She is really a bad person which we learn after we see what she did to what of her ex school mates. Mike is a cheater and a liar who only follows his own interest and pretends to be a nice guy. All in all, shallow and selfish people on a show who always dress well and always look like they woke up into a salon. That in itself is really unrealistic. I hate to be a prude about this show, but the language on here needs to be cleaned up...as well as all USA network shows. The acting was bad and story line worse. We managed 2 episodes and asked each other why are we torturing ourselves. The suits are no match to the good wife/fight, Ally McBeel or the others. After watching the first season, I cannot understand why it rated so high. It lacks the depth in characters. It's ok if you have nothing better to do.<br/><br/>I watched the Suits cause I was curious about Meghan. I am so disappointed. I thought she was "a big movie star", but she only has a small role in average tv-serie and she is at tops an average actress. Her role in suits is extremely easy, and she doesn't even look beautiful, quite the opposite. She is way more beautiful in the pictures as a royal than in more "real" life. Suits is not suits if harvey, louis and mike didn't stay together they are family they are what suits is all about. You ruined it with mike in season 7 and now you do it again with louis WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE!!!! And moreover why the hell did you let harveys mom die she could have met donna and they could have lived happily ever after. This could have been the best series ever but you just had to ruin it.
Thanks for making my life worse. Season 8 is the best so far! Finally some justice to all the characters especially Harvey and Louis. Also better lines and stories in this season ;)<br/><br/>The new characters like Sam and Alex are the best! Much better than Mike and Rachel!<br/><br/>I just love love this show! It's my favourite show. I love the scenes, colors and stories of each but I don't understand why two things about Harvey and Donna. Why Harvey became weak and foolish in season 8 with low self esteem and why Donna has so much power which is really unrealistic. I like tge character so much but I feel she is becoming a super woman. 
Also the soundtracks are amazing . Simply awesome, cannot get myself to switch off the tv until I have finished all the seasons !! All stars from me ,, i love harvey , i love louis ,, ots so engrossing This show is a generally brilliant and quirky show, that could have halted a tad earlier. Beautifully shot and altered with an extraordinary sound track. Likewise in this show will enhance Young lawyers analytical thinking. Over a year after my unique review, this is my most loved show. I just viewed the main episode of the new season.<br/><br/>I like it so far and it makes me smile, laugh and engages! Would Recommend it to everybody!! Suits is a comedy-drama series about Mike Ross , a guy with photographic memory that hired by the best lawyer in NYC , Harvey Specter. Honestly , i was a bit skeptical at first because i think it will like lame crime TV- series that work on some shitty case. Turns out it was a clever drama about the employee of the firm<br/><br/>(might be spoiler)<br/><br/>It's a smart , complicated , funny and intense comedy-drama series with a spark of betrayal , loyalty , blackmailed , a lot of twist and romance. Suits also have beautiful scenery of New York City , which make this series more interesting. Even if you don't understand or like some lawyer stuff , i'm sure you'll love this series Suits has held my interest from season to season with twists and turns and relationships which are not surface but complex. The premise of the show is unlikely in the extreme but made believable because of the acting and the interactions between the cast members. The good and the bad are marched before the screen, as are the petty and the grand. <br/><br/>The thing that has lately rubbed me the wrong way is that most people have a penchant for swearing in a particular way and the writers have given all of them the same penchant for using G-damn which is not realistic and on my part, not appreciated. The plot is so interesting, there's need to detract from that. Keep us on the edge of our seats and wondering what's next. I didn't watch this show in its entirety and hence cannot comment on it as a whole. But I must say this, since I haven't seen any of the other reviewers point it out. Meghan Markle is a deplorable actress. This is the first and only performance of hers that I have seen and found it hard to watch. Her lines are recited without any intonation in her voice and no emotion. She just walks in with an exaggerated hip swing, recites some cliched line and walks off with a hairflip. I'm at a loss as to how someone like her with such poor acting skills was kept on and personally for me she was the main reason I just couldn't watch any more of this show. I just knew that every single episode would be about Ross's secret almost being revealed, Harvey and Ross screwing up on numerous occasions (but they're supposed to be the best?) and yet somehow having everything go their way in the end. Everything else about the show like it's unrealistic dialogue, repetitive story lines etc have already been mentioned by other reviewers. I wonder why this show has such great ratings. Watch the Mentalist, White Collar or Person of Interest if you want to see what a really great investigative show looks. I've quite enjoyed the Ross & Rachel thing. But I'm not sorry it's ending. If I hear that quote one more time I'm going to hire Harvey Spectre to sue for copywriting Friends... I love this TV series even sans the sparkling Meghan Markle, but the real story is the emotional vulnerability of the Louis Litt character. 
Just so fresh and new. 
Thank you. The truth is this Television Show began boldly with the actors setting their life on course to wearing 'Suits'. A suit is a clothing; worn at respected offices by us. Law is the bar like a high jumper who takes three steps towards the bar at the height: ' Rum, Pum and Pum'. 
The high jumper needs to roll his body so that the pivotal shift of the centre of gravity in the body becomes compressed; a suit is a clothing that is worn like a shirt or like a jacket and has buttons to join the trunk. The Television Show covers the office space of lawyers who work for private firms and spend their days in 'Suits'. 
Cinematography and acting are the two pictoral evidences that we have from the first two seasons. The seasons were strong in fashion like a horse is with a rider. Humor though dark as contrary to absurd tells us that seasons one and two which consists of acting and cinematography are successful to viewers interests to be entertained; rated eight point six on the International Movie Data Base. 
Firms are places of work where concentration and quietude are maintained because like an unopened set of Christmas gifts; a television show is a waste of work in the world with no bars or laws. Bringing laws to the illegal world is the achievement that lawyers bring; word of mouth: take a bail and watch suits. This is the best show i've ever seen in my life. I've Never seen such an interesting and awesome show. The characters are just perfect, it does have a nice story and a great setting. 
I've created myself a IMDb-Account just to show how good SUITS is! After watching this program for quite some time and enjoying the characters and plot I have regretfully decided that Henceforth I will have to boycott watching "Suits" due to the excessive and loosely use of the "GD" word used way too often, I find it very offensive. I wish there was a way to have the scripts edited to exclude the use of the GD word. It was a great series till S07 .. season 8 and 9 is so silly and don't worth a minuet of your time .. very disapointed and i regret the time i spent watching it .. I have been trying to reach someone who cares & could change things. I love this show (suits) but can't watch anymore because Of continued use of taking the Lords Name. First it was GD all over the place and then the last show I watched it wasn't just GD but then he said Jesus Christ. I can't just standby & say nothing. I will really miss the show unless it could be be changed. Hope this reaches someone who cares. For the life of me I can't understand why such language is at all necessary. You know it is not that long ago that you would not even hear Damn on TV and to see what is being said now is just unbelievable. I cannot believe what is happening to this world. What will happen to our poor kids. God Bless us all. Like too many other series this show had two good seasons before the writing went to hell.
I knew the series was lost when they got permission to curse.All this senseless cursing took the place of meaningful dialog.
Every episode was an exercise in contradiction.
"You know why you're right?"
"Let me tell you why I'm wrong."
"Wait, I just realized why you're wrong".
"You couldn't have because I just realized why I'm right". Every episode.
Another issue was repetition.
"You know what's the matter with you?"
"No. Tell me what's the matter with me".
"You know how tall you are?"
"No, tell me how tall I am". Every episode.
These people fought over the stupidest things and usually made up just before their next stupid fight. They always seemed to be in a hurry to misunderstand, do something unnecessarily and misinterpret the intentions of their coworker.<br/><br/>The writing staff should've been fired after season two , so these characters could develop personalities. I quit after Season 6 Ep 1 despite there being genuine humor because it was clear the writers had no idea where to take the show. The lasting impression of this show is that everyone walked without a hunch and the writers wrote without a hunch either. The last few seasons had been going down hill fast. The whole gloom and doom overhanging dynamic was played out. What should've been the end of the show (Mike's departure) has seemingly been its biggest saving grace. The departures left room for characters like Samantha Wheeler to enter and captivate the audience's attention yet again. Robert might not be able to fill Jessica's shoes, but Samantha sure can. Who is this chubby faced, balding, rabbit toothed, ugly smile actor called Rick Hofffman? I fully understand why his IMDb photo includes only half of his face. It's to stop scaring the kids, of course.<br/><br/>As for his acting and character in "Suits"... why have they ruined this series by including this guy in it? By all accounts, the other actors are really good, and I'd really like to watch the series, but every time I start to like an episode, the weird looking obnoxious and cocky guy called Louis Litt shows his face and ruins it all. I can't stand 5 seconds of him and his stupid grin.<br/><br/>Maybe he helped get the series started and has a contract that can't be broken.<br/><br/>Until the director wises up and dumps this actor, I'll be giving this series a miss. There are plenty of others without him in them. I'm somewhere in the middle of the first season, and I like this show. For a "law firm cutie", it's more than not bad. But it took me TEN episodes to realize this was New York! I mean, seriously!? Blue skies, light colors, flowers everywhere... Have you BEEN to New York? A lawyer walking around without his designer shades is a criminal offence. A law firm with offices that let natural light in is a violation of some code... allegedly. I thought it was Los Angeles!!! Talk about error in geography, geez! The constant use of goddamn is offensive and stupid; it's ridiculous that every female wears outfits cut down to THERE in this day and age - just a way to draw and keep male viewers ðŸ™„, i can't watch this tripe any more! Blech!!! Donna is bad actor
She ruined the show
Please go take some acting classes I watched this series 3 times until now Donna you should stay as a secretary
You stay like episode one
Only the secretary and btw u become a bad actor
Harvey and louis that was your show
Katherine heigel im your fan but this not your show its a big mistake Made it through four episodes before I just couldn't stand to watch this Mike idiot anymore. He is supposed to be this genius but he's a clueless moron that can't do anything right. Not to mention he works at some hotshot law firm but can't dress the part and always has his stupid backpack hanging over his back while riding his bike around! He's an annoying character! Ruins the show for me... Dule Hill as Alex Williams... so bad. I haven't seen him in anything else, and I have no desire to after watching him in Suits. His lines are delivered so poorly, like straight off a script instead of organically. Just super cringey to watch.<br/><br/>Anyway, the first 6 seasons are great. I'm studying to be a lawer but as much as I enjoy the show it is not realistic. Don't get me wrong I am still adicted to the show but if it was under oath I would't say it was realistic. However, the new episodes have gotten better for somewhat realism accounts but what the suits directors need to do to succeend is to have a lawer present to make the outcomes more realisitic and not fake. Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams) is a brilliant mind who often ends up in the murkier part of the law to make ends meet. He gets paid for taking the bar exam for other people. He delivers a case of weed for his drug dealing best friend. He avoids the police and ends up in a job interview with lawyer Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht). As the ace closer of his firm, Harvey often use his instincts to skirt the law and in this case, he decides to hire the law school dropout without a law licence. It's a big deal since it's fraud and the firm only hires Harvard grads. Harvey has his plugged-in secretary Donna Paulsen (Sarah Rafferty), rival litigator Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman), and mentor Jessica Pearson (Gina Torres). Mike falls at first sight for beautiful paralegal Rachel Zane (Meghan Markle).<br/><br/>This is mostly fun although nine seasons is too long by half. It's over-wrought to the point that the constant yelling becomes a part of the motif of the show. Another part of the motif must be the Toronto for New York non-descript business buildings. As often is the case, the best has to be the cast of characters and the actors inhabiting those roles. It's a great group of actors including a future princess. It's fun to hang out with them in their suits. Upto season 7 is really good. They are now unnecessarily stretching the series. I rated it 8 earlier , now downgraded it to 7. Even i stopped watching the series after season 7. Early seasons were awesome, 8's and 7's. later seasons are still good with some awesome sprinkled in.<br/><br/>Season 6: 8 (1 viewing)
Season 7: 6 (1 viewing)
Season 8: 6
enjoyable but mediocre season like season 7, until it finished strong with the last 2 episodes (1 viewing)
Season 9: 6 (1 viewing 9/26/19) I'm in season 7 , but really season 5 was the best and favorite, and I recommend to swap suits title to "from the first place" because u will hear this sentence dozen times each episode ðŸ˜‚ I have watched every episode of suits and I have enjoyed it as my most fav show until Mike left. It's been more like a test of what and who will make put them back on my top list again.This season, I just hear lots of raised voices, fighting and frustration so I am losing interest in this show. Confidence and accomplishment doesn't require constant anger, fighting and yelling. It was nice to see Mike back but in his new role but he lacked the chemistry that made us love this show. I think we all rooted for the underdog (Mike) and Harvey as a mentor. Donna, Katrina, Gretchen and Samantha are awesome if Samantha would stop fighting all the time she her role would be better. Luis is indispensable and keeps the show fun he is our love/hate him character and we love that he is becoming a father. I think they should just tie Fay up in the basement feed her and leave her there for a year to cool off and rethink her need for power and vengeance on everyone :) I do like Suits. However, over the recent seasons, the tone is very fast paced, with lawsuits story lines getting too much complicated. On the other hand, the relationships with the main characters are little repetitive with hate/love situations. It is interesting show, but not as good as the beginning. I really like the cases being solved in this show, although sometimes they get hard for a casual viewer to follow.<br/><br/>What's really annoying about the show are the little things, such as Donna's constant "I'm Donna" attitude which they took too far, Harvey's over the top confidence which is so overblown that it looks fake, and the Mike-Rachel relationship as well as the Rachel-Donna relationship.<br/><br/>I honestly can't tell what I hate more: The Rachel character or Megan Markel's acting as Rachel. I'm not a big fan of the actor portraying Mike either, although all the secondary character actors are awesome, such as Conleth Hill as Edward Darby, Michelle Fairley as Ava Hessington or Abigail Spencer as Scottie. I specifically remember watching Donzaleigh Abernathy as Clifford Danners mother easily outclassing every single main actor on the show.<br/><br/>Lastly, we know that the writers are trying to keep the show +13 and can't curse, but having the word "Goddamn" used 2 times per sentence by every single character gets really frustrating after 6 seasons.<br/><br/>Good show overall, it just feels to much like a "show" for me to fully enjoy. Over the last few years from time to time I've watched this prime time "USA" network series called "Suits". And it's a clear legal drama that involves crooked deals and backstabbing situations of many of the firm partners, as if you were looking for a show of courtroom scenes and trials this is not it as most of the scenes and drama goes on in and out of the firm's office. Plus the characters personal lives are on a showcase as the up and down things like relationships, sex, and money and personal decisions highlight the series. And it also features some good eye candy with it's female casts. Overall okay legal drama. T went from brilliant show to, i don't know....something i want to watch now....<br/><br/>What a shame :-( This series seems to have it all: very clever written, great cast, interesting storys, lots of humor and sarcasm, all in all a very intelligent and well-written series that I would recommend to anybody at any time. Some of the plot of this series matches with my life. And yes, I cried several times watching this show. Suit used to revolve revolve around make ability to have a photographic memory. Which always led you to think what did Harvey do before Mike. Well now you have the answer they still are bad ass and is still a bad ass program with or without mike This is such an Amazing show I loved it soo much and now I want to be a lawyer because of this show ðŸ˜‚ Suits has been my absolute favorite TV show to watch .
I can watch suits over and over however in season 8 there is just way to much swearing which I so unessery . This is the best show! This show has really good. It would be a crime to finish season nine. This show has really good. It would be a crime to finish season nine. There were losses, but I think it's possible
Keep going. They're planning a spin off of suits. I'd like to see the veterans actors. Really good scriptwriting, acting, direction and film production. Snappy dialogue, good character development, novel story concept and witty banter make it thoroughly enjoyable viewing. Highly recommend. I don't really understand how come some people can be so judgment about this tv serie, we hear comments like this is very unreal and absured. This is a great serie and the first 4 seasons ar great maybe the plot is not the best but the dialogues and the characters are giving great live lessons and teach us a lot about love and care anencephaly friendship.
One of the main reason that I love Suits is cause of the genuine relation and care that Harvey has for Mike and the fact that Mike is so greatful to him but can still contradict him if he doesn't agree.
This is a great serie and I recommend it to everyone cause it's emotional and clever and at the same time entertaining and full of values. Gripping show about a group of lawyers who all belong in prison. If you fast forward through every scene with Louis Litt the rating moves from an 8 to a 9. If you love a quirky law series this is for you. Better than the practice which was a favorite. Character based show that really gets you to love and hate them. One of my favorites of all time. Beautiful actors and actresses as well and talented to boot. Well written with lots of subplots going on easy to follow. Loved it. Harvey and Mike make the most amazing pair of smart, classy and fast lawyers. Louis is one hell character to watch and appreciate. Jessica and Rachel have done their best. But Donna has too charm to be ignored. The best lawyers tv shows! It's remarkable how the actors played. I rate this 1 out of 10 because Chanel Kano is watching it now I started watching the show for entertainment but soon realised that it has much more to offer. Now I get my daily dose of motivation and solutions to real life problems from it. I can relate my self to different characters at different times. I am sure everyone has passed through atleast one tough situation of the several cases.I am so influenced by it that when ever I am in trouble, I think how Harvey spectre would solve this problem.
Not only is the cast outstanding, but editing to script, everything is crisp Sometimes u think is this the best tv show acting i ever seen I literally couldn't even finish the first episode, its SO boring and clichÃ© An entire seven seasons of people having 26 second conversations with each other which start off polite then end up bad, or the other way around. Still, good show. Man oh Man this is hell of an awesome series.
Actors are great i mean each and everyone of em have got killer skills which has made this series so awesome and addictive.
I love corporate world and this series shows exactly how things work in corporate world. If you love corporate world then you sure as hell not miss this one. Watched all seasons... 1st season is amazing, 2nd and 3rd were a little slow for me. After 3rd season all seasons are a 10/10 Einfach gut, meine Frau und ich lieben diese Serie This is honestly one of the best shows! I love New York City, I love the law and I love smart lawyers! But this show also has drama, romance and emotion! It leaves you wanting more. Trust me, I'm pretty picky when it comes to Tv shows, but this one is special. I will admit tho, after watching 6-7 hours of suits, I am more than happy to change things up for the day. But all in all, it's really good. Suits season 3 is a smart and elegant TV show. This TV show is the best for people who are hungering for legal drama which include romance, legal drama and some emotional scenes in one of the most successful attorney firm in New York city. This season mainly revolves around the merger of Person Darby and also the Bribery charges of Ava Hessington who is the CEO of the Hessington oil company. Harvey and Jessica mainly look into the legal matters while Mike sees his romance with Rachel and Louis Litt fights in an in-house trial with his british counterpart for the possession of his cat.
At the end I think that this season of Suits was disappointing in comparison to the seasons 1 & 2 because this season was mainly focused on Mike's romance with rachel. I am desperately looking for a new series to sink my teeth into having completed bingeing Bloodline, Mad Men, Catastrophe, Insecure. I tried the Wardrobe (boring), Call the Midwife (liked it, but I'm too cheap to pay for episodes), OITNB (halfway into season 3,honestly I lost interest).<br/><br/>Suit is just OKAY... I do like the main characters and enjoyed episodes 1 and 2 (only on S.1, I know - very late to the party) but I can't help but remember the good lawyer shows of yore, including the early Ally McBeal and L.A. Law. Is it me, or are these new shows just weaker incantations of their predecessors created by youngins who don't even remember those old shows? Or at very least, viewers giving a 9.0 rating for Suits can't possibly have ever seen them, right? How could this compare with Season 1 of BB, or Homeland? Or Bloodline for f's sake? I don't get it.<br/><br/>Back to Suits. The good is the NYC location (always a plus), acting- I DO like Harvey and Mike, and the law firm set-up, love law shows and their don't seem too common now.<br/><br/>I guess I'm getting old. I am starting to lose interest, gonna try one more. Suits is a show which telling us lawyers' lives. Maybe these lives are not standard lawyers' lives but the things which have done by Mike Ross and Harvey Specter against legal problems are promoting young lawyers' love of law. <br/><br/>How do I know this? Because I am also a law student. My GPA is increased after I watch the whole series. Because it gave me a purpose for working in the law field. This TV show emphasizing rule of law in nearly whole episodes.<br/><br/>Young lawyers and lawyer candidates must watch this show. Each of them will take a lesson about the law. At least the show will improve their analytical thinking. This is an amazing show. In the last two weeks I have binge watched on Amazon Prime, I just could not stop watching. The writing draws you in with an original plot and it is put into action with the best actors. Their execution of their characters are flawless! Gina Torres is dynamic as Jessica Pearson, words could not explain how amazing she is. Gabriel Macht and Patrick J. Adams are my new fictional boyfriends as Harvey Specter and Mike Ross. I could list every cast member and their rolls and list their amazing talent. Highly recommend this show. Please check out my Youtube channel, HamstaGanza, where I review movies, TV shows, and more.<br/><br/>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRGRIqK6c1T8FXLla0t__0A<br/><br/>My wife and I just finished the first season and it's simply binge watch worthy! Spectacular performances from such outstanding actors. The writing is superb and so clever.<br/><br/>From the moment you watch the pilot episode, you will be sold on this show! Suits is an extremely entertaining lawyer TV show that has the right blend of drama and comedic elements. You will simply admire the show for it's true potential and for having such well developed characters. Each episode has something special to deliver and it stuns every time. Loads of unexpected moments which create more tension.<br/><br/>Gabriel Macht and Patrick J. Adams are the perfect duo! Their chemistry is fascinating as their differences blend into winning cases! Mike Ross(played by Patrick J. Adams) is a young man who is extremely talented and remembers everything he reads and sees. He can recite any book he's read or knows how to ace an test. However, he is dragged down by bad habits and not using his talent to his true potential, UNTIL his world crosses into an interview for an new Harvard recruit into Pearson Hardman(which is one of the top law firms in NYC). Harvey Specter(played by Gabriel Macht) is a senior partner at Pearson Hardman, who is slick, sexy, and has quite the reputation when fighting in court. He makes every suit look amazing and makes want to suit up! Harvey interviews Mike and from there the rest is history......<br/><br/>I will review each season as I am currently watching Season 2. High recommend this courtroom drama! Please do check out my Youtube Channel, HamstaGanza<br/><br/>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRGRIqK6c1T8FXLla0t__0A<br/><br/>I'm in the beginning phase of my channel and I'm slowly moving up. Hope you find this review helpful. Let me know if there is anything you would like me to review. Any feedback would be appreciated! :) Thanks. I really wish the writers would eliminate the use of the Lord's name being used in vain. I don't think it's necessary to use such language to keep the viewers watching this show. The story lines, great acting and Lewis' comic relief is enough to keep the ratings up where they need to be. I don't remember the language being so vulgar in the beginning of the series. Using that language is a way of "padding scenes with junk words" in my opinion. The world is so full of anti-Christian behavior, it saddens me to hear that prime time TV has to follow along for attention?! Not sure why, but it's bothersome.i know there are young adults watching this show and it just gives them the wrong idea....like it's okay to use this type of language on such professional settings. In any setting for that matter, while parents are trying to instill good morals/ values in their homes. What can I say about suits. It literally gripped me from episode one of the first series and I haven't looked back since.<br/><br/>The producers of this show spent a considerable amount of effort in developing the characters for the viewer and it really paid off.<br/><br/>The show tends to be more about the characters than the specifics of the law, which in my view sets it apart from other legal drama's as you feel more involved with the them as you follow their journey, which is a journey into the life of the mega rich lawyer elite of NYC and how even though they have money, cars nice "suits" they still fall victim to the same issues that many others do, relationship, parent/sibling issues. <br/><br/>The dynamics between the characters is almost perfect, the only negative I can give this show is that sometimes and it is only occasionally the legal side of the show drops the ball and becomes a little wishy washy and not that believable. But overall this show is one of the best on TV at the moment. <br/><br/>Thank You I like the show and would enjoy it so much more if the characters did not use the word GODDAMN every time they open their mouths. They just love to use the word that takes the Lord's name in vain over and over. There are so many other words they could use instead. I'm not opposed to swearing in the right context, but take any episode and there will at least 12 GODDAMN'S in it. They use it for the most ridiculous reasons. "Oh, could you hand me my Goddamn jacket?" etc. They don't use the "Jesus Christ" one over and over so at least I give them that. How about: Damn Jacket or Darn Jacket or Effing Jacket or Gosh Darn Jacket or Freakin' Jacket or Dad Blamed Jacket Or how being more polite and say "Jacket". This show is still keeping me interested despite the 6 seasons. Does it become redundant, yes slightly but they still throw in couple twist and it's not entirely a regurgitation for 5 seasons. <br/><br/>I have to admit i was dreading watching this show. But i was pleasantly surprised. If you like lawyer drama, despite their not so accurate representation of what a corporate lawyer actually does, you are in for a treat. It's kind of like Scandal and how to get away with murder minus the murders and dead people...<br/><br/>Worth watching? Absolutely ! If you want to binge watch, i think this show is the best and won't get bored or feel like you are watching the same episode over and over again. I have watched Friends, GOT, HIMYM and all those sit-coms. But believe me this is the the best sitcom you can watch if you are the one who loves mind games.<br/><br/>Basically in simple words this is about a poor guy achieving his dream without the requisite education, and the heights which people go to save him, his firm and his family is simply great.<br/><br/>Harvey Specter is that guy who walks around with a glass of some fine Scottish scotch in a pizazz looking suit, but he is not that little teddy bear. He is ruthless, and he makes deals that he wants to. <br/><br/>Donna Paulsen is that sexy secretary you see in places, but she is not a doll to play with. She means business and does it so elegantly than what you can think of. <br/><br/>Rachel Zane is that sidekick of that prodigal child, but she is not just a paralegal. She is the only daughter of Robert Zane and she is the motivator.<br/><br/>Louis Marlowe Litt is a Villain, Hero and a Comedian. He is everything.<br/><br/>Robert Zane is that friendly foe and also runs a law firm in New York rivalling Pearson Specter Litt.<br/><br/>Jessica Pearson is the master of all, she knows everything and truly the master.<br/><br/>Mike the prodigal kid, who has got a photographic memory is the one on which the story is revolving around. He has got a secret and by the end of the fifth season literally everyone gets to know about it.<br/><br/>This is truly an awesome sit-com. I have loved this series since minute 1 an incredible good law series with quality acting, scripting and highly likable characters not to mention its roller-coaster story line.<br/><br/>The story is constantly taking twists and turns which results in series based on a potentially boring subject highly enjoyable. It is different and not repetitive but at the same time provides a strong storyline with timeless characters<br/><br/>The acting is unlike anything I've ever seen in a TV series. It is brilliant, perfect casting to represent the each character and the high octane life of a law firm in New York.<br/><br/>P.s. the intro is better than any TV, so good I've never skipped it. I've watched so many TV shows in my entire life but suits is the best! Everything is just perfect. The acting, scenarios, everything! I like the comedy within all the drama. I love the story and it always gets my tears out! I also can say that its soundtracks are brilliant, they use unknown songs and they force you to dig around to find them and listen to them all then time. All the actors and actress are smart and perform very well. I felt every detail in this show. I felt the sadness that I saw it in them, I don't think they were really acting! they were living the scenes and the emotions. I have never though I was watching some people acting to get my mind into the TV show but all what I saw was felt. when they were depressed absolutely I would be depressed. I lived the disappointment, the joy, the love, and every feeling they had! 100% recommended and I already started telling people around to watch it Well, I have been watching Suits since a long time and at times I even watch some of the episodes again! Its great to watch Harvey Specter delivering the catchy phrases and the chemistry with Mike Ross is just soothing to all our senses. Its about the chronicles in a law firm with some ups and downs juxtaposed with thrills. Some of the ideas to some extent are unrealistic but I guess as far it entertains you that really doesn't matter! I bet you will be a big fan of Harvey Specter and his catchy phrases once you get into watching the successive episodes of Suits. Individuals specifically associated with the law stuff will find it more exciting. Though in general its a great series to follow. this show has you on the tip of your toes through out. And the fact that all the men in the show are so extremely good looking makes you want to just keep watching. this show brings men which are well educated to this sexy new outlook. i enjoyed this TV show a lot because even though there is a lot of drama, there are some parts which are very serious and this show is very realistic. the first time i even knew about ASL was before it became famous because Suits did a couple of episodes on it. This is one of the shows that i never get bored off. i give this show a 10/10. its downright amazing. what are you doing looking at reviews now?! go watch the show! Its 1:30 am, Thursday morning, here am I'm, in the middle of S01E07... And now, writing a review, uncharacteristically. My word.<br/><br/>This show is the real deal.<br/><br/>Believe it.<br/><br/>I'm in that mode, fortunately for me. I've managed to never see an episode, and I have four seasons ahead of me.<br/><br/>Do not ask for an opinion of this show from someone. Its not needed.<br/><br/>Suits has a new God Damn fan.<br/><br/>Enjoy It! <br/><br/>JRE4L. There's LOTS makes this series exceptional.. but for me, it's summed up in the attention to detail. Many programs have good scripts and acting to match, but just listen to this one tune (on youtube... Fink - Looking Too Closely) at the end of season 4, episode 8. Go back.. look again at the really total package programs you've watched through the years.. they don't happen without some absolutely awesome musical scores. That's why Suits stands out... the selection, pacing and timing of the score is near perfect.. and when you bring it to that level of detail for a TV series, you have something that is unquestionably out of the ordinary, and a cut well above all others. Oh yea.. and the casting, story-line and acting across the board holds up equally well. This is an addictive, fun show to watch (and listen to).. kudos all-round!! PS... everything worked up until the S5 ending. No doubt, they had been digging a huge hole all along, and that S5 finale could have gone two ways.. and they chose possibly the wrong one, or maybe not. But if they're now going to do what makes any sense at all, they'll have to cause despair for most of their entire fan base.. we'll just have to wait and see. And so finally it concludes.. cheers Suits... great series always have to come to closure.. and true supporters never want it to happen.. but know it's always inevitable. This was one of the best, every category (name any one) was always top notch. We watch programming for all the reasons this great series provided.. and it's not going to go away just because this one magnificent production concluded. There will of course be others to come along, but without doubt, this is one that surely will be hard to replace. Bravo to every one involved on all levels.. you have much to be proud. And we'll all go back to view your work again.. it was truly something special. Stand corrected... In August 2016, the series was renewed for a 16-episode seventh season, which is set to premiere in 2017... alright !!! This show is good, even great sometimes, but it has a serious problem: Paper!! They have all those computers, and tablets, and phones, and money, and yet they do everything ON paper?? This is ridiculous!! They don't have a digital archive? No scanned documents? I wonder how they find any information in there. It's absolutely hilarious, that firm looks like an seventeen century monastery from Transylvania. Even children in primary school are using digital manuals and quizzes! Who's using tons of paper anymore when you can fit entire libraries on a microsd card? There was a certain episode in which they were using a fax machine!!! Really?!? What's next, a Gutenberg press? Despite all these oldies-nerdies i really enjoy this show, especially that spicy redhead secretary. Personal secretary, another thing of the 20th century. Why not use Siri, or any digital assistant, like 24/7! And they say lawyers are smart! The digital nerds will eat them for breakfast. These lawyers should stop copying words from computer to paper. They should start using copy-paste methods, just like the prime-minister of Romania. Suits is one of best TV series within all times. I am a big fan! period... but why?<br/><br/>By the way, I even watch some of its episodes few times.. This is something I do only for The Big Bang Theory and Suits.. As much as it seems hard to catch smart quotes or law related subjects, it also feels you relax and also every time you can get some new aspect to enjoy (same like TBBT). <br/><br/>First of all, it has really cool characters and excellent performance. Also its story line: Don't expect seeing actions, fights, murder cases and etc. Whereas it shows law cases, big company merges, politics and etc. Somehow these make more sense in our life than others.. We see other kind or writings anyway all the time.<br/><br/>Second one is its SOUNDTRACKS; it submits THE BEST musics by far for any kind of TV series (at least for my taste and style). Check out its sounds from 'SoundCloud' or 'Youtube', this could be even enough to love this TV series. <br/><br/>Few words to Harvey: he is the coolest character. He is kind of a modern super hero for me. The way Harvey handles things is legendary. His quotes are epic. Mike Ross is also second best character in this movie. Friendship of these 2 guys is not a kind that you can find in all episodes. They both perform excellent. 3rd guy would be definitely Louis, frankly this little complicated, smart, insecure, sensitive and sometimes annoying character is the spice of this show. Mikes's girl friend, Rachel still not there (for me, her role is a bit messed up at the moment as of Season 4 E 7).. Donna and Jessica are doing just good. Also there are very rich list of quest stars joining show for long and short term. <br/><br/>Also I like how they dressed. All men and women dresses very cool and fashion. <br/><br/>I strongly recommend this one. First 1st or 2nd episode you'll understand if this fits your enjoyment or not. Thanks to producers for keeping this TV Series alive and greetings to all actors. I am incredibly impressed with this show and love the fact that it is not your typical lawyer drama. When I first heard of this show I heard good things but the ad just did not do it justice. I wasn't expecting much but from the very first episode I was hooked. The writing is incredibly smart and witty and it feels like the cool organisation in the real world. Some shows you roll your eyes at how absurd it is but the outrageous things in Suits feel completely plausible.<br/><br/>There is definitely room to improve and develop on the storyline and I think they have the ability to do this. I will be continuing to watch this show for a while to come and think it will just get better and better.
