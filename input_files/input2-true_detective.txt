Right when the opening credits start and you hear that morbidly beautiful song 'Far From Any Road' by 'The Handsome Family', you know that this isn't going to be your usual cop show. Now, if you're more into action films, avoid this at all costs - but if you like amazing performances and dark, brooding cinema peppered with some black humour and a slight psychedelic touch, you're going to love this. The atmosphere and the southern ambiance of this show are so rich and the cinematography is so beautiful, I can hardly think of anything in recent TV-history that compares to this. To make a musical analogy: if the crazy, creative energy of 'Breaking Bad' felt like 'Led Zeppelin', this feels more like 'The Doors'. The slow, bluesy, hypnotic pulse of this show draws you in and hooks you - and then it doesn't let go. By the way, the original music is also excellent (T-Bone Burnett) and fits the mood perfectly. <br/><br/>As far as the actors are concerned, there's nothing but great performances. Even the smaller parts are perfectly cast and the two leads: wow, just - wow! Harrelson (freshly returned from 'The Hunger Games'), plays the "normal", more down to earth character, while McConaughey (still marked by his own personal hunger games) nails the part of his slightly mad, highly intelligent but nihilistic and severely depressed partner. Watching them play off each other (again, after 'Edtv' and 'Surfer, Dude') while their conflicted - and conflicting - characters try to solve a ritual murder is so captivating (and so much fun) I honestly don't care that much if they are ever going to solve that crime.<br/><br/>So for the moment, I'm giving this 10 stars (I can still take back a few if it all goes downhill from here), because in my opinion, there wasn't a single note out of key so far. The writing is top notch, and if the creative team behind this can keep it up, this could turn out to be HBO's next 'Wire' in terms of quality. Cary Fukunaga ('Sin Nombre','Jane Eyre'), who will hopefully one day adapt Stephen King's 'It', proves once more that he's a very accomplished director and a talent to look out for in the future. <br/><br/>My verdict: if you like a well told, character driven story (that might lead you to some very dark places) and if you're not put off by a rather considerate pace, I can't recommend this show enough - this is some great television.<br/><br/>Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/<br/><br/>Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/<br/><br/>Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/<br/><br/>Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/ Season one is a beautiful thing.<br/><br/>Then Vince Vaughan happened and the less said about that the better. If you want to skip this review just jump to the IMDb list of awards and nominations, and you're done.<br/><br/>If you want the skinny, let me say this is one of the most perfect dramas ever to grace your flat screen.<br/><br/>Harrelson, you need to understand, is no slouch. He does crazy better than crazy people. And he usually steals any scene not nailed down.<br/><br/>But Matthew McConaughey operates at such a level here -- not to mention the astonishing makeup which makes him appear to be playing his own father -- that he walks off with this production. Mesmerizing.<br/><br/>Everyone is pitch perfect, which I believe explains the casting awards. Even Michelle Monaghan, usually known for getting by on her amazing looks, does more acting her than anytime in her career When i first heard about the show , i thought to myself that with a premise and cast like that , what could go wrong with this show? Well there could have been a lot of things. For example the plot may have been overdone or under thought , direction may have been all over the place , but the first episode proved that it was not to be so.<br/><br/>The plot looks delicious...yes it does and the neat direction just purely compliments the smooth design of the show. Even though story telling is non linear at times , but it has been managed very well with subtle dialogue and the growing suspense. It does get dark at times but handles all its complications with ease.<br/><br/>The casting is clever...very clever. Both Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson are brilliant actors and at the same time have a certain mystery about them that is Perfect for the show. They have a firm grip of their respective characters and seem dissolved in them.<br/><br/>This show is NOT just a regular cop drama or a clichÃ©d murder mystery. It is much much more and has already proved so in the first episode. Much is expected from it and the future looks bright for True Detective.<br/><br/>UPDATE ( Episode 2-6 ) - Now 6 episodes have gone by and i believe my views have changed a little. The richness of the show in the first couple of episodes completely PALES in comparison to the speed, smoothness and uniqueness in the latter episodes. From the 4th episode is when the show actually picked even more momentum and proved its worth as possibly the greatest thing on television at the moment. McConaughey is truly having the golden period of his career. The future (probable) Academy Award winner (For DBC) is at his freaking best as Rust Cohle. Harrelson is brilliant as the angry and flawed Marty Hart. I liked this show. But now i am addicted to it.<br/><br/>With 2 more episodes of the season to go , one can only expect the best from this fast-paced , beautifully crafted show.<br/><br/>So far, an obvious 10/10.<br/><br/>Final update: ( Episode 7 & 8 )-- Well the series ended last night on a very thoughtful note. Up until the 7th episode, the show had picked up so much speed and given us so much to think about that i was expecting a little too much from the last couple of episodes. Who wasn't.<br/><br/>*********** If you haven't seen the series , please Don't read on*********<br/><br/>The 7th episode was truly amazing as it set the stage for Rust and Marty's final adventure of the series. There was too much anticipation for the final episode, but did it deliver. Yes and No, depending entirely on how you look at it. There were no unusual shocking twists and there were no unrealistic happenings. It was quiet a daring and a brilliant end to a show that explored beyond any other show's reach. But to be very honest, as a single episode , the finale wont stand out. But as an entire series , i believe we have been treated to one of the best television series ever made. The writing and direction have been top notch. Acting has been flawless. Am gonna miss it.<br/><br/>10/10 This show is fantastic. Both Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey are stellar and the rest of the cast are amazing. Every person gives meaning to there character. The story is dark but it never gets to dark. It adds some humor every now and then which is done well. Also there is not a lot of Action so if your looking for a Action filled series this is not for you. Dialogue is well written you can tell that a lot of time was put into the shows script. Cinematography is absolutely jaw dropping they have some beautiful shots in the first 3 episodes. There is 0 shaky cam for those that hate it. I hope this show has a long run because it's fantastic and it really stands out from the rest of the crime shows out right now. Overall I recommend this show to people that are looking for a stellar story. Absolutely brilliant 10/10<br/><br/>*Edit* 2/24/14: Just finished episode 6 and I like how this is all playing out. I am really looking forward to watching the rest of the season.<br/><br/>*Edit* 3/10/14: Now that True Detectives first season is over. I have to say that this season will go down as one of the best achievements in Television history. The amount of emotions this season had was unbelievable. Truly some of the best Television I have watched. This is a show which almost bathes in success before it's begun. With it's cast and their pedigree of work i cant see many people interested in this type of television not seeing it.<br/><br/>Regardless the pilot grips you with non-linear suspense driven story telling. Vaguely some kind of serial killer murders young women in a ritualistic manner and our 2 protagonists catch the case. What follows is a tantalising taste of what I'm sure will become one of the most well wrought shows of the year, as is the norm for HBO. Teased with mystery and the promise of a story worth hearing being told in a superb manner, Its hard not to fully recommend every mature adult checking this show out.<br/><br/>The only demographic that wont be thoroughly satisfied with this work are people looking for lighter "easy watching" style programs. This isn't an episodic cop show, True Detective is dark and unapologetically twisted. Last spring (2014) while surfing IMDb for a new show to watch I came across True Detective, a show that had received rave reviews across the board. I'm not a particular fan of crime mysteries, but I figured I'd give the show a shot. After all, IMDb ratings had been pretty reliable in giving me an idea of good a show would be. I thoroughly enjoyed Season 1. In fact, I'd say it's one of the best pieces of television I've ever seen. Yes, one of those rare masterpieces that stick out from the usual assembly of cheesy sitcoms and thrillers.<br/><br/>Season 1 verdict: If I had to give only season 1 a rating, I would give it a 9/10 with no hesitation, and possibly even a 10/10. The show was everything I had hoped for and more.<br/><br/>Needless to say, I was excited for season 2. I waited for the entire show to air so that I could binge watch it without having to wait a week between episodes. I eagerly turned on the first episode of season 2, but as the episode dragged on it became apparent that this episode was a real let down. It was a series of of plots that all seemed to have no relation to each other. It was hard to even follow what was going on. "Hey, that's okay" I said to myself. I figured it was just a necessary lackluster episode that would set the stage for all of the glory of True Detective that I knew and loved. Instead, I continued to be disappointed by episode after episode. Sadly, it became very clear that Season 2 sucks. I don't use that word too often, unless it's warranted, but in this case it surely is. During the middle of episode 4 of Season 2 I just turned it off. It was so poor that I couldn't even watch it anymore. I came back the next morning hoping to try again and got the same result. Season 2 is basically unwatchable.<br/><br/>Most of Season 2 involves a few seriously depressed brooding alcoholics staring at each other with sad serious faces uttering dark cheesy lines like "Those moments, they stare back at you, you don't remember them, they remember you". I mean, come on, really? The whole thing is just cheesy and I lost all interest in the problems of these people. I want to give Vince Vaughn some credit here, because he did some fantastic acting, but that couldn't come close to redeeming this season.<br/><br/>Season 2 verdict: Don't even bother with season 2 unless you like being disappointed. It sucks, plain and simple. Slow paced but well acted, True Detective season 3 returns to its roots. Incorporating a plot point touched on in season 1, the series becomes familiar in its surroundings as two back country detectives attempt to locate missing children in a town where truth lies below the surface. The Cinematography and Score are fantastic, making for and eagerly anticipated re-do that erases the inadequacy of season 2. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. This is one of the finest debuts after the end of the behemoth that was Breaking Bad. It is, however, darker, sinister and more tense than BB's first season, boasting the same level of uncanny actor performance... Mcconaughey's character is a multi layered, conflict ridden pessimistic, walking black whole with a uniform and a brilliant mind, Harrelson plays the family man cop with a bigger heart and a down to earth perspective - the clashes of both ways of life are amazing and when both actors discuss deep topics, each with his own take on life, it's as good as anything they've ever played. The story is shocking and still simple so far (only first episode has aired at the time of this review) which it makes up for in the awesomeness of the pagan thematic, it leaves plenty of hints and cliff hangers at the end of the first episode so there may still be very interesting twists to it. Directing is exemplar in shots, pace, dialogue and I even enjoy the color balance. Editing is phenomenal too. Very highly recommended! Of course, I knew that HBO was putting this out there. What I didn't expect was to be hooked from the opening titles. Atmospheric, moody, moving at the laconic pace of South (not to be confused with slow). We, as viewers, are watching the story unfold just as the characters do. Harrelson and McConaughey are simply and elegantly perfect, playing off of each other to the perfect degree. The cinematography is stellar, as is the story as it begins to unfold. I had no idea what I was in for when I turned it on, but I'm hooked, and can't wait for the next and the next and the next...secrets abound, tantalizing clues are everywhere, but where do they lead. I'm can't wait to find out. TD 4 Bring back Rust Cohle alright alright alright After just watching tonight's series premiere episode of "True Detective" on HBO, I can already tell this is going to be a fantastic show. It kept me interested and almost forced my attention the entire hour. It is already beginning to build a complex plot so make sure to pay attention to the details. All the elements of a brilliant show are at hand here. The writing, the acting, the scenery, the plot. Everything, from what I have seen so far, is amazing. The show has this dark, eerie feel to it which I love. McConaughey and Harrelson deliver great performances. Do not watch if you aren't into complex plots. But otherwise, I strongly suggest giving this one a go. I don't know why but I can't enter my how many stars review, so I'll just write it here as 10<br/><br/>From the opening credits, which seemed like a combo of the credits of 'Six Feet Under" and "The Killing" with a little James Bond" look all with this ominous song, to the end I think this is going to be something great. It will not be for everyone, I already have seen reviews of people hating on it for not having action and being slow, well this show like many others is going to be a "Slow Boil" type of show. For those of you who don't know this story arc and actors/characters will not be continuing after this season, i just read that it will be a total of 8 epiodes with a solid conclusion and than will move on to another story in season 2 making it an anthology season series like American Horror Story. I'm really glad another show has decided to do that format and hope that there will be others in the future Ever since the Sopranos raised the bar, we have been treated to some great TV shows this past 10-15 years, & with True Detective, the latest offering from HBO, i think we might just have another beauty. When you have Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson playing the leads, the hope & expectation rises & judging by first viewing, they look like they wont disappoint. They are both very different characters, we get to know how they were in the 90s, and how they have changed into the present day, and how they both have individual issues. The overall feel of the show is a little dark, but the mood seems perfect for the show & the cast compliment this brilliantly so far. The bar as been set by a number of shows in recent times, but initial impressions, and with this duo leading the line, True Detective could well be right up there in the future. I intensely dislike series that tidy up all the loose ends of a mystery in the last 30 minutes of a series that lasted 8+ hours and that had little to do with almost all of episodes leading up to the grand finale. In most mysteries the cast of characters are identified early on in the series so we the audience can wonder about their guilt or innocence. No such luck here. We are left instead with a drama involving a troubled relationship between one of the lead detectives and his wife which dragged on too long and involved way too many flashbacks which often left the viewer mystified about the timeline of events taking place. Wow. That is seriously all I can say after watching the first episode. The episode is amazing. Will definitely be tuning in again and so will you. Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey do a great job. The script is very well written and drives the story hard. This show is all about the story. It has the feel of a mini series not a TV show so it will be interesting to see where it goes. But it is one powerful script that is acted out great. This is the first 10/10 I think I have given on IMDb. Once you watch it you will know why. I will be shocked it this show does not win awards. It may be the best show on HBO now and I would say it's up there with orphan black with it's ability to grab your attention and keep you glued. I have just finished season 3 and I write this only to warn against it. It is a complete waste of time. 8 boring hours that you will never get back. And all the time you want so much to believe that the season will be more exciting just around the bend. But it won't. Forget season 3. I wish someone had warned me. For starters, IMDB should have separate these into seasons. First deserved 10, second 2, and third barely 4 stars. I've reviewed first two so let's say something about this, third one. Some mild spoilers but no big deal.
There's been some kind of trend going on for TV-shows in past few months: all talk, nothing happens. This one is truly in line with that. I've noticed that in Punisher, Star Trek Discovery and now here. Everybody is just leading endless idle conversations about nothing with nothing really happening. This season of TD really deserves TD. The whole season, all eight episodes could fit into an average yawning 100 minute movie. If it wasn't for a brief Rambo episode with "the revenge of the war veteran (Mr. Woodard) molested by idiots" , it would be completely empty. It's hard to comprehend this. Excellent actors and performances of nothing. All idling. Talks, thoughts, more talks, slow pace, them slower pace and some talks and thoughts. In slow pace. After this third season it becomes obvious that the creator and author is colossally overrated. This is not story telling, this is graphomania. Please, don't waste everybody's time and/or money and/or talent on more filming such stuff for television. Go find something else to play with. OR, rename the show to Conversations and Thoughts. This one has nothing to do with a detective. Or true. I can't take it anymore. I was patient with Season 3, very, very patient, too patient. That, because: since Season 1, I cannot look at a lawnmower without imagining some creepy murderer driving it - that's how powerfull the cinematic universe was there, like the issue with the shower-curtain in Psycho.<br/><br/>I gave Mr Pizzolatto the space to unravel his talent, over 4 episodes, not counting the farse that was unwatchable (Season 2). I complied with and tolerated him doing the pastiche of season 1 in season 3 - the same ritualistic child abductors/creepy manufactured toys similar to the twigs-traps in season 1/tormented detectives. But while watching episode 5 (which was announced as a huge revelation beforehand) I mean WHILE, DURING THE EPISODE- instead of following the darn story, I found myself surfing the net searching for opinions. Because my esteem for the show was fastly dropping under the tolerable line.<br/><br/>There are lots of ways of telling the story of two detectives. Even when using a pastiche. I believe that Mr. Pizzolatto exhausted every drop of creativity and this masquerade should end here - no more True detective failed attempts, please. Season 1 was fantastic, season 2 was okay but season 3 is just the same episode shown every week, literally no progression of story, it is so painfully slow with endless mumbling, I can't imagine what they were thinking, clearly a case of style over content. I strongly urge you to get involved with another show, this one does not deserve your precious time (Series 3) Irritating switching of timelines (which was ok in series 1) became difficult in this series. Mahershala Ali's acting is laughable, especially when portraying his older self. He does a cringing caricature of an old person what with his bent leg walk and wandering gaze and, quite frankly, no more than 50% of his dialogue is understandable. None of the characters are at all likeable apart from perhaps Stephen Dorf's. A ridiculous plot relating to Ali's wife made no sense at all and added zip to the overall story. Is it really likely that the wife of a detective would be permitted to write a book on the case her husband is working. Really?? Made it all so difficult to watch and then the sucker punch of an abysmal Deus Ex Machina ending. Uuuurrrggghh! This is even worse than the second season, but HBO at least tried something new back than. Well, what you get here is strictly back to the roots. Because the producers be fooled into believing that the former trick was the kind of narration-style, ...telling the story by those questioners. Therefore the same ingredients, the very similar music, the exact same brand overall - like presenting an old story on a used bowl. (The same mistake that Westworld made)<br/><br/>But even if every detail seems to be back on track, nothing matches any more. Particularly the interaction between the new guys in relation to Rust and Marty. They drove a blazing touch of buddymovie despite the tragedy around - that was the truth in that detective-story. Now it goes the wrong way round...tragic of course, kids are missing, but no humor inside.<br/><br/>As much as I devoured the first season, I can not swallow this. Yes, good filmed, well plottet and all homework done:<br/><br/>Anxious and intense kind of boredom Season 1: Absolute best.
Season 2: Average, still enjoyable.
Season 3: Absolute garbage. It tried so hard to be like season 1.
1. Firstly, the "story" or "premise" didn't deserve 8 episodes. Atmost a short film of 1 hour would have easily suffice.
2. It isn't a crime drama anymore, it's a family drama built around Mahershalla Ali.
3. There is no gas to run this season, everything is already seen in season 1. Chance encounter with real culprit, Killing the wrong guy for the crime, sudden hint for the real culprit.
4. there is no closure, no satisfaction, no answers to ur questions in finale. The only attraction they had was academy award winner Mahershalla Ali.<br/><br/>Questions:
1. In finale, Hoyt confronts Wayne, threatens him that there are dangerous people who wants Lucy Purcell case to die down. NO answer abt it in rest of the episode.
2. Lucy's uncle body was found by TV people, NO answer abt it.
3. Finale was so much garbage, like they found one eyed black man so easily and he tells them everything , literally vomits everything. If it was that easy , investigator hired by TV channel who could found body of Lucy's uncle, why didn't he find him.<br/><br/>conclusion: True Detective, what a shame!! First season was so good, and I had to see absolute garbage now. So hard to give this a rating. The first year it was a 10/10. The second year it is a 1/10. I kept thinking I was missing something. I started out by recording the series and after 1 1/2 episodes, I had to cancel.<br/><br/>I realize the cast and the story line are different, but surly there is some cohesion among the developers.<br/><br/>This season is dull and slow moving beyond words. The characters are lifeless, the plot dry, the pace, sleep inducing.<br/><br/>I Looked forward to second season, but I am so disappointed. I don't even consider it watchable. I see by other comments, it isn't me. So sad. 3rd season is an epic way to waste our time...
Always stalling, jumping 10, 30 years forth and back... Cheap way to tell simple and shallow story.
It's like Indian or South American soap opera, many things happened, nothing was told... Oh, so boring.
First season was good, second was a desaster, thrid is a punishment for watching the second!
They just used the old glory of the first season, but I will never watch a 4th, even if they make it. OMG. Season 3 is just mumbling, oddness. ***SPOILER ALERT*** In episode 4, the part where the detective is old and having a breakdown involving Vietnam war hallucinations??? I LITERALLY COULDN'T UNDERSTAND A SINGLE WORD OF THAT ENTIRE SCENE!!! This series is steadily going down hill. The acting is better in season 3 than in season 2. But the story line and writing is so bad, it's gobstopping. I feel badly for the actors starring in it. Because they are actually the ONLY reason why I am giving this 4 stars. The first season was critically acclaimed, and with good reason... It had great acting, fascinating characters, and an intriguing storyline that drew you in and kept you interested. Admittedly, Season 2 had some big shoes to fill, but instead of continuing with their winning formula, the creators decided to make things exaggerated and overdone. The Season 2 characters are insincere, unlikeable and overdeveloped, with every possible problem, obsession and kink to make them appear edgy and dangerous. Instead they come off as silly and contrived. The acting is also atrocious, which is surprising coming from solid performers like Farrell and McAdams. Vince Vaughn is especially bad, and always appears as though he is doing a parody on SNL and will drop the punch line at any moment. Perhaps some of the bad acting can be blamed on the ridiculous script, particularly evident during the scene between Farrell's character and his attorney ("I welcome judgement."), and the one between McAdams and her father. You almost get the feeling that you are watching a B-movie worthy of Tom Sizemore and Steven Bauer, it's that bad. Even without high expectations, the second season is a big fail on all counts and will disappoint all but the undiscerning viewer. The 3rd season is a true disappointment so far. After 4 episodes I gave up. Nothing is happening. There's very little story line that actually moves the plot forward. There is a lot of extraneous conversations that might be necessary in the first two episodes to build characters. But after 4 episodes and excruciating slow pace, I lost interest in the actual mystery. I really like Mahershala Ali and he did a great job in his role in three different periods. The aging effects are also unbelievably amazing. But those are not enough to hold the viewers interest. This story should have been done in 4 episodes and many scenes should have been cut out. Maybe then, it could have worked.
For those who will continue to watch this season, I wish you luck. I hope the ending wont disappoint Series 1 and 2 were good crime dramas. Series 3 feels we need love affairs with the black actors.I for one have no idea how this series is getting the reviews it is.actors are one dimensional and the slow build up of a love affair is a sleep fest. I won't bother looking out for series 4. Absolutely excruciating. Loved the first two seasons. Loved the first two episodes of the third season. But THIS. This is dull beyond dull. As of my writing, this thing is getting 10s . . . wtf. I truly do NOT understand how that happens. I stuck WITH season 2 for the 'style,' and I'm ditching this, it's so dull. Please. The first season indeed was excellent, but come on.. it has seriously gone WAY down hill since. The actors/acting is -for the most part- grade A spot on.. its the damn story lines that leave much to be desired, if not plain suck.<br/><br/>This latest season has its moments but for the most part is flat out snooze boring.. with all of the constant scene by scene jumping back and forth between 3 different time periods is exhausting to keep up with.. especially when the story isnt all that interesting to begin with! Add to that 2018 PC racial stereotyped fictional crap and ... well, it doesnt make for that great of a show. At most this deserves a 5. Sheesh.<br/><br/>HBO sure knows how to ruin a good thing. They've cancelled the best and ruined much of the rest. 1st season was excellent, 2nd was OK but the 3rd season is unwatchable. Slow, boring and confusing with continuous flash backs. Could end in 3 episodes at most. You have to suffer 6 episodes of unconnected mambo jumbo in order to watch in the final 2 episodes the connection between the various pieces. Total disappointment. This isn't a slow burn, it's just slow, and the pace never picks up. It's a convoluted story and jumps between three different time lines, and none of them are the least bit interesting. Seasons 1 and 2, brilliant, season 3, should be called True, stop, rewind, play, what, Detective. Between the bouncing back and forth, and the mumbling, half the time I don't know what is going on. Don't care who took her, where she went, what happened to her, etc. Better luck in season 4. You can watch the first and last episodes and not miss anything. But I wouldn't recommend even doing that. It would be a waste of 2+ hours of your time.<br/><br/>There is little point in pointing out the many flaws in this the third, and hopefully last, of a series that started with so much promise in season 1, then fell off the precipice in season 2, and finally crashed to a certain death in season 3; but you know it's bad when the actors 1) look like they have no idea why they are in the story and 2) have the same expression on their face regardless of what is going on, which is basically zero. And the big reveal? A nothing burger. It's simply talked through, making it clear that the writers had no idea how to construct a storyline and create an impact. Thumbs way down. We waded through 7 episodes of Mahershala Ali mumbling and fighting with his wife - following all kinds of red herrings and misdirections, too many characters, and it just ended with a fizzle with episode 8. I'm glad the girl was okay, but it was just too much trouble to get there. Good acting (especially Stephen Dorff), moody atmosphere, etc, but the end didn't justify the means. Not sure I will bother with the series if it returns. After the first two episodes I was excited for a great show. Then it just went on and on without anything happening. Many things went to nothing. Walking around then talking for a bit, driving a little, then something might happen and then the episode is over. You hope the next episode will show something new and interesting, but nope... Nothing happens. Even the final episode was boring. It hinted at new things, but they went nowhere.
So the story is this: A man is haunted his entire life about a girl dissappearing. Haunted for no reason really. Turns out nothing bad really happened. The end.
Do I wanna watch it again like I did with Mindhunter or Manhunt: Unabomber? NO! This was an 8 episode love story with crime interludes. The first episode presented mystery grit and compulsion, but it all went down hill after that. Time jumping lead nowhere, Acting was very one dimensional, Location just copied the first series. No punches, No twists, No suspense. By episode 5 I had no interest I kept watching just in case the writer had an evil super twist for the ending, NO.
The first series was epic, the second watchable, but the third was awful, should have been called True Families not True Detective. It's just a solid social drama. Strong, intelligent women, men who fight their outdated masculinity in a search for sensitivity, (white guy fails at that), satirically terrible police work as a symptom of institutional impotency.
If you wanted a crime story, a strong plot, a mystery, a thriller, suspense, police work, extraordinary characters and dialogues - none of that is here.
The plot itself is suitable for one episode of a procedural. The character development - for one and a half hour movie. Stephen Dorff is out of his depth, as expected. Mahershala Ali - surprisingly boring, maybe it's his character's fault. Is it a must watch show?
No. It just wasn't interesting. Won't miss a thing if you didn't watch it. Dull, and a little bit of a torture to watch.<br/><br/>Was the story good?
Not really. It seems like there wasn't enough content for eight episodes. There seemed to be a lot of filler scenes of characters and their personal lives. It is always nice to see a detective's personal life, but in this case, it was repetitive and dull. When the mystery is finally solved, you will realize that the twist at the end was forced, it wasn't natural. Even if the ending was simpler than expected, it is an ending, except that it was ruined by all the content leading up to it. The truth is that this is not based on true events, and the writers simply created a story for season 3 without spending a lot effort on the story itself. They did however, spend a lot of effort in ways to drag a short story to unnecessary lengths. They should have done with it in 4 episodes and it wouldn't have been such a torture to watch, or they should have better written the filler content. It seemed almost like the writers wanted the viewers to remember the first season, they even showed a newspaper clipping of that case. In the last episode both detectives say that they don't feel like they got closure, it feels more like the writers knew that they didn't have much to offer.<br/><br/>How was the acting?
The acting was perfect. The actors were all interesting. There was so much potential story telling with this cast, but the writing let them down. It looked like they could have had amazing chemistry, but I guess writers thought otherwise.<br/><br/>How was the musical score?
Not that great, but it did however create mystery to something that, at the end wasn't there. The usage of the score is similar to the usage of jump scares in an uneventful scene by a horror film, just to keep people at the edge of their seats. Even in the last episode, after the mystery was solved, it just wouldn't let go.<br/><br/>Reviewers advice:
Avoid it. There are better shows that are worth your valuable time. I did like the first season though, and because of that, felt a need to watch it. Big mistake. Not the kind of review I thought I would be writing, but, it is what it is. Season 1 was phenomenal! If you don't freaking read so much into this show and pick apart every little detail, you will be entertained and pleased. My opinion may be biased because I believe that Matthew M and Woody H are both great actors and were perfectly cast together. They have a chemistry on screen that is very believable and so enthralling. The story line is generic, and somewhat predictable, but the acting is what draws you in. <br/><br/>Season 2! Watched first episode THREE times, I am literally bored out of my mind, I can not digest this. I think where they went VERY WRONG was casting Colin Farrell, good god is he a horrible actor. I feel nothing from any performance of any movie he has been in, and the same rings true for this performance. Unfortunately, the rest of the actors also seem completely lost with their roles. None of them take it to the level of emotion and intrigue as Matthew and Woody, they set the bar way high with their performances. <br/><br/>Sorry to say but this could have been a great series. I have a feeling that the show is about to lose a massive amount of viewers, unless they can revive it with season 3. I am not even going to waste the rest of my time with season 2, its completely garbage compared to Season 1. Hollywood, please learn from your mistakes, Colin Farrell has bombed every show or movie he has been in, he just isn't a convincing actor, please stop giving him roles. While the acting is fantastic, this story just never picks up. It's a slow burn that leaves the viewer unsatisfied and wanting to delete his HBO subscription Season 1 was a 10, season 2 was a bit weird but season 3 is a disaster. Every episode is boring and the main actor is trying too hard to copy Mathew from season 1. Its so obvious in every scene. And then the disappointed ending on top of that. Liked season one, Loved season 2, struggled through season 3. I get the great acting, cinematography and long moody scenes. However I just felt the music was so dramatic for season 3 and hardly anything happened! Even the finale was a huge anti climax. I found myself always expecting something amazing to happen and it just fell short.... dull as dish water. Don't let season 3 put you off watching the other two. Disappointed! Dont waste your time watching season 3. Or the energy trying to make sense of the confusing ending.
Season 1 was Great. 2 ok at best with a great theme song. The first couple of episodes were somewhat promising despite the fact I can't understand what Wayne is saying half the time. But then it just drags on through maddening time warps until I don't know if I can get up the energy to suffer through the last episode.
1st season great. 2nd season mediocre. 3rd season abysmal. First of all, if each season is going to be a new cast with the new story, you should be able to rate each season separately. Season one is the greatest thing that's ever been on television. Season two sucked. Season three is possibly the biggest waste of time i've ever experienced. Spoiler alert, nothing ever happens, at all. I so regret ever watching this season. Obviously the writer has no more ideas. HBO, please end of the show. 8 episodes of slow talking and no action.
What a terrible season. Even though I objected to the portrayal of my beloved Louisianan as a state filled with incestuous, dimwitted swamp people, I loved Season 1. I awaited Season 2 with excited anticipation. The opening credits greatly impressed me with mysterious graphics and a theme song of which I never tired. The first episode was a jumble of meaningless stories that seemed to have no connection, but we have all seen this technique used before. I told myself that I simply had to wait and everything would become clear as the story unfolded. The cast was beyond impressive, so I kept watching and waiting for the characters, any characters to have a shred of appeal. In eight episodes, I never cared one tiny bit about any of them or the worlds they were trying so hard to hold together. The tag line is "You Get the World You Deserve" and they certainly did. Where Season 1 enticed the viewer into a frightening and strange world that seems to have been reclaimed by the magical forces of nature, Season 2 drags the viewer at gunpoint into a man-made cesspool populated by equally worthless creatures who deserve that world. More than a few times, I found that I was playing solitaire out of boredom and had to go back to see if I had missed something that might make me care about anything that was going on. I never did find a thing. The best part about this series, besides some of the music, was that it finally came to an end. I was always taught that you should try something at least twice before saying you don't like it. Well after watching three episodes of TD Season 2, I can honestly say I don't like it. I'm so disappointed after being such a fan of Season 1. Months ago when I read about the casting for Season 2, I started to get worried but decided I would keep an open mind but Season 2 is just so ridiculous there is no saving it. I keep asking myself how the show could go bad so quickly. Was Season 1 just a fluke? Was Season 1 so intriguing and amazing because of the supreme acting skills of McConaughey & Harrelson? Whatever the reason, this show has definitely tanked in Season 2. There are so many things that are absolutely ridiculous about Season 2 it's bordering on being comical  The writing is just ridiculous.come on "I'm feeling apoplectic" really?  The look that Rachel McAdams is sporting is a total FAIL! Ridiculous unkempt hair doesn't make you tough.  I don't even know what to say about what Vaughn, Ferrell & Kitsch are trying to do but it's all bad.  The ridiculous Vegas singer in the light blue suit of the latest episode<br/><br/>I'm just glad we had one good ride before the park closed. The first season was stellar. It was intriguing, gritty, and was never boring. The 1st season's characters interacted spectacularly with each other.<br/><br/>The second season is starting to stink. The bossy woman character is killing the show. I hope the obligatory woman character doesn't kill the series. But, Que cera, cera.<br/><br/>The second season's characters don't have the depth that the first season had. Are there different writers? If so, they chose horribly. The first season was a 9 only because I don't believe in a perfect 10. The second season is a 5 and is sinking fast. There is no way the viewer ship will be close to the first season. Please don't ruin the show with obligatory bossy women. Seems that anything with Matthew McConaughey is destined to be impossible to follow. I watched, with great difficulty, all episodes up to #5 of Series 3 and just gave up. These strong accents coupled with slurred speech makes the thing impossible to follow and I've reluctantly had to pack it in. Couldn't find the subtitles switch. It's something of great visual impact and I daresay great acting, but not everything you see is worth the effort: you need to be able to listen as well. Matthew "Mumbles" McConaughey has made another mess. Shame, could've been great. It is not the same as the first season.<br/><br/>There is long drama scenes, and the storyline is not so exiting... There is to much slow drama stuff in too many different scenes. With all these famous, and high qualified actors, I expected more. I will still watch it. - Just to see if it improves later. Now I give it only two stars...<br/><br/>I miss the mystery... and the feeling I had in season 1 I wish the "crew" from the first season came back... and fixed it up...<br/><br/>I am disappointed...<br/><br/>Carsten - Norway Eliminating the bias of comparing seasons, True Detective Season 2 as a standalone is an utter failure. The story is flat, boring, and depends upon weaving a multitude of paltry stories together to somehow create a tapestry of depth. Is this about corruption, possibly something important about life? At this point who cares? Episode after episode this meandering only becomes redundant, unnecessarily complicated, and frankly unimportant. We've seen the same story many times before (whether it's Chinatown, or this latest episode's comparison to Heat), however there is nothing new or unique brought to the table this time around. It's all pointless dialogue, characters who don't deserve our interest, and a head writer so full of himself he can't see the forest for the trees (spoiler Mr. Pizzolatto: your forest is burning down, in a slow, miserable death). In essence, there is nothing worth watching in True Detective season 2.<br/><br/>Vince Vaughn is arguably the worst I've ever seen (both in his acting and acting as a general craft). While season 1 proved to break McConaughey from the chains of Rom-Com typecast, season 2 proves to me that some actors are bound to certain genres for a reason. Vaughn is not meant for drama and perhaps not meant for television. Watching him struggle each week to convey a character far different from himself was at first hilarious, but has now become painful. Every line and little soliloquy of word salad that falls out of Vaughn's mouth makes me cringe and shudder. Yes, McConaughey was long-winded and questionably delusional last season, but he had the stuff to pull off the craziness (and he has the awards to show for it). Nobody was shocked to hear McConaughy wax loco in Season 1 because it would probably be the same ideas he'd impart on you as you cheers'd Coronas and ate fish tacos on the beach in Venice. If Vaughn (or the rest of the Season 2 cast) said any of their dialogue to me in real life I'd have to laugh and tell them to grow up. Neither their characters nor their dialogue is believable or frankly unique enough to capture interest.<br/><br/>Aside from Vaughn's cancerous acting flop, there is a somewhat devoted effort by Colin Farrell, Taylor Kitsch and Rachel McAdams who show that they can act regardless of their character or the poor writing. It's clear they are giving their brooding characters their all and doing their best outside the show to hype it up and convince us all to stay patient, KEEP WATCHING!! Unfortunately their strength as actors gets lost in the lack of skill by the season's new director(s), the terrible writing, and the drivel of monotony they seem to be stuck within. This season could have been good, SHOULD have been great for these three actors. Unfortunately it really is not.<br/><br/>This season isn't a flop because the viewer's expectations and hopes of a second season 1 are not being fulfilled stylistically. It's clear that a show (head writer) can only ride the coattails of success for so long until the true colors come out. Pizzolatto has proved to us all that without Cary Fukunaga, True Detective season 2 is all clichÃ©, poor writing, and pointless, pointless television viewing. At this point no amount of gunfire, crazy existential twists or Yellow King can rescue this show from it's pointless mumbling, a plot and idea that has drawn on for far longer than it should. It's very rare that I tell a friend that a TV show blew me away, but that's exactly what I said when discussing the 3rd episode with a friend. I've been watching the show from the first episode and after each one I sit back and think how special this show is. I watched 'The Wire' and 'Breaking Bad' in their entirety, but 'True Detective' surpasses them both. The performances of the lead actors, Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson is masterful. The personal failings of their characters is brilliantly portrayed as is the interaction between the pair. The plot is very interesting, but what really makes the show is the lead actors. Matthew McConaughey especially gives the performance of his life to date. I'd never considered him a great actor prior to this, but he holds the screen and enthralls the. viewer with his broken, but intelligent and dogged character I get board by long reviews, so I'll end, but if you like character studies, a good plot and great direction, then give 'True Detective' a try. You will not be disappointed. I started watching the third season without expectations, I must say superb acting from Dorff and Ali but who's the true detective? Ali's personal issues and introvert personality have way too much focus, and going back and forth in time of the investigation sometimes is confusing and shows that both things are filling some hours in this 8 episodes series. Pizzolato script lack fresh ideas and breaks the monotony of this bringing the end abruptly. After 7 episodes I have the aftertaste I've been watching Hays (Ali's) bland biography. To tell the truth in my opinion Dorff rescue the series lifting the boring, depressing atmosphere and could get the job done himself alone in 4 episodes cutting the fat out of the steak. To be honnest, I was slightly afraid to watch the season 2 of this show after the dreadful reviews I read almost everywhere. <br/><br/>I liked season 1, very solid TV show and entertaining. Very solid mistery too. <br/><br/>Season 2 though is a true delight if you enjoy Noir novels set in corrupt LA, and James Mc Elroy is a clear and obvious influence to be honnest, where the end game is not really to solve the mystery but to show how broken and hopeless the system is. <br/><br/>Even though I quite understand why some/many would rate season 2 much lower, I like it more than season 1 for the gritty, dark and desperate situation the protagonists are slowly drown into. I only rated 9 because i didn't like season 2 that much , but season 1 and 3 are just a masterpieces !! Specially the acting of Matthew and Ali , the story and the script , the atmosphere they created in this show is attractive ,i fell in love with the show , one of the best i ever seen Season 1 very good , season 2 was ok , but season 3 is nothing compared to the rest . Was a dissapointement. ðŸ™„ I managed to - just about - work out the plot in the first 3 episodes of series 3, but it was no thanks to the dialogue.<br/><br/>Wayne mumbles his way through the multi layered time zones of the story and although I enjoyed the general jist so far, I found myself wishing I had learned to lip read.<br/><br/>Maybe it's because I'm an audio guy? Trying to watch E2, it's pain indeed. The first episode ...hmmm, hoped it's just intro, let's see.... This episode (02) is absolutely hopeless. As someone wrote before, already the intro music is a torture. Good cast, in theory only, actors are lost, none of those rather experienced professional has a clue where to take the character. The direction is a disaster, hard to figure out if the script is any good, perhaps it is/was and the director screwed it up. I am writing this to warn potential victims and because I am bored, the episode runs as I write but once I got that minimum of review words will switch it off, as I guess it will only get worse. Not sure how you create a masterpiece such as season one, and then lose you way, to the extent they did, with season two. I realize it must be ridiculously difficult to follow up something like season one, which is as good as television has been in decades. It was monumental. The writing was superb. The monologues were gorgeous. Not so with season two. It felt as if the writing team had left the room. There was only one monologue in one episode that made me even sit up and take notice. Vaughn was excellent. He really did a good job. But, he did not have that much to work with. And the ending? Come on. They could have done a lot better than that. They did what they could to match the darkness of season one. But, they could simply not create the kind of environment they created in the Bayou, in Los Angeles. It felt like a sort of contrived darkness. And by using scenes of downtown Los Angeles, as the city of Vinci, they kind of lost me. It was not enough of an effort. Kind of a sad follow up. Just did not have the heart and soul of the first season. The rather banal hunt for a particularly deranged serial killer is not what drives this series, which is basically a character study of the two cops investigating the case and the development of their relationship during 17 years. <br/><br/>"Character study" can be the kiss of death in a cop story, but here we have two interesting personalities. Especially Rust Cohle, the character played by McConaughey. Cohle is a pessimist cop with a nihilist approach to life. He thinks that most of humankind is trash, an idea probably shared by most cops, but he is extremely clever and articulated in expressing his opinions. He speaks in an annoyingly low, flat monotone, uttering long and complex sentences that exasperate his colleague Marty Hart, played by Harrelson.<br/><br/>Sadly enough, Cohle may have a good point. However, his wisdom, fundamental decency and dedication to his work do not bring him any satisfaction. Despite understanding well the flaws of humankind, Cohle is leading a depressing life, like the people he despises.<br/><br/>Hart is a more conventional character, but his "normality" plays well against Cohle weirdness. It is ironic how Cohle and Hart coming from different places at the beginning of their collaboration are shown as living in the exact same way at the end: lonely and alone.<br/><br/>Unfortunately quite a few things do not work in the show. Among which, the need to explain Cohle nihilism with a personal tragedy, as if his misanthropic nature needed to be rationalized. Then, almost all the women in the story are whores, stupid and needy. Several young and extremely hot girls throw themselves at Hart, which is weird since he is not that attractive. Many others are for sale or would be, if not too old for business. Even Hart's wife, played by Monaghan in the only female role with minimal substance, seems able to use only her sexuality to prove some sort of point.<br/><br/>Finally, the monotone used by Conaughey, although effective to prove the emotional flat-line of his character, is extremely annoying and almost inaudible. Effective in the first episode, by the time I reached the last, I could not stand it anymore because I could hardly hear a thing.<br/><br/>Eventually, this is a series where men use their brains and end up as heroes and women use their sexuality and end up â€“ as usual â€“ as victims. Season 1 True Detective, different actors, different story, different class....absolutely amazing.....the following seasons average in comparison. Season 1? Yeah that's one masterpiece there.
Never bother about watching Season 2, you'll definitely loose 8 precious hours of your life! I will rate now the first three seasons:<br/><br/>The first season is somehow the most interesting, because it has with Rust a real true detective, which doesn't care about anything (nihilism would describe him) and tries everything to solve the case, while his partner plays the more classic cop part. The case itself has a deep meaning and the detectives have many problems to find even a suspect. In the end I think it's not so much about the case itself. Instead it's more about the scenerie which is dark, twisted and full of mysteries. But also it leaves you behind with some unanswered questions like Why have Marty's children some toys (Google it) which look like case they investigating? 10/10<br/><br/>Second season deals with many true detectives and some mafia structures. I didn't like in that season that so many people had to die, especially some detectives. The drama was good, but sometimes I thought we are not in a crime scene instead more in a family drama (example rays relation to his son or true detective women's relation to her father). And I think it was very inconsistent that a cop like Ray would be so stupid meeting his son without carefully looking around... Th end of the mafia boss was also unlogical... where did the others get to know his location? So all in all it was also interesting, but not very clever. 8/10<br/><br/>Season 3 was from the story very interesting. I would say like season 1 but the problem here is the time. I think an old true detective which cannot remember everything is not very motivating to watch these parts of the show. I think also the development of the story was too slow. The last plot twist was somehow unimaginable, but I didn't like that he figured everything out in his last years and then suddenly forget this. IT WAS THE CASE OF HIS ENTIRE LIFE. Why should he forget? That makes me a bit angry. I gave it 8/10<br/><br/>If one would ask me which season i liked the most Ofc S01. Secondly I like S02 because it has more interesting characters than S03, while S03 has the better story and is more consistent. I really liked Season 1. That's the score of 8 you see up there. Unfortunately IMDB doesn't allow us to differentiate between the seasons.<br/><br/>However for me, unlike a lot of other punters I gather, I loved Season 2. Loved the big city environment this time and Vince Vaughn's parallel story, along with those of the 3 flawed cops, of the crim trying unsuccessfully to go straight. On top of all that, the big set piece shootout which came in Episode 4 I think, was mindblowingly good. For me, Season 2 gets a 9.<br/><br/>And then we come to Season 3 which I was really looking forward to, especially after hearing all the good, early reviews, only to hit the wall. What a disappointment!<br/><br/>It's well produced, well acted, still has the good soundtrack, but what happened to the story? Seriously?<br/><br/>We get 8+ hours of the Hays' s marriage breaking down. And really, neither Wayne Hays, nor his wife Amelia are the nicest of people anyway. Who cares? I thought this was True Detective, not The Young and the Restless. We are led to believe a TV crew are going to do a real life crime expose focusing on interviews with an old, retired detective with Alzheimers? Big ratings in that one for sure! We never find out much about Roland West by the end of the season, beyond the fact that he partners Wayne at various intervals. And really what happened to the detecting? It almost seemed that Amelia and Elisa achieved more in their investigating than the cops. Surely the police would have investigated mad as a cut snake Lucy Purcell (played by an awesomely convincing Mamie Gummer), more forensically in real life. But no, she's pretty much given a Get Out of Jail Free card until she heads off to Las Vegas never to return. Really the whole storyline in terms of establishing some sort of police procedural didn't make a lot of sense. It's probably appropriate then that the big mystery ends up having a shaggy dog element to it, rather than the horrific crime it initially appears.<br/><br/>Ultimately far too much situation/family dramas in Season 3, not enough actual detective work and almost a total lack of any sort of action (a short firefight and a fistfight that cut away when it was just getting interesting) made it a fairly significant disappointment for me. 5/10 Let me just say this. The only thing comparable to this masterpiece, in terms of quality, is breaking bad. But forget all that, forget everything you thought you knew about thrillers and drama.<br/><br/>This show is incredible. from the performances to the writing to the cinematography it is a pure masterclass.<br/><br/>without spoiling anything, i will tell you this, if you are unsure about this show watch until the last 5 minutes of the third episode and from there on out the show gets better and better.<br/><br/>this show is terrifying in every aspect dealing with child sex abuse, mass corruption and what it means to be a man. this show is not for the light of heart and contains easily the most horrifying scene in television. (SPOILER: the scene i am talking about is when marty watches tuttle's tape).<br/><br/>For fans of films and tv shows, the girl with the dragon tattoo, se7en, Zodiac, silence of the lambs and mystic river i will say this. this first season is scarier, more well written and more intense than these already amazing films. you will be haunted but you will not regret it. this show will challenge how you percieve your life. The roles were as big as the natural horror of the setting. The depth plumbed to be Rustin Cohle is a life time achievement. Harrelson wasn't the giant but he didn't need to be the lead. Their off screen connection makes this a once in a lifetime hit with superb performances.<br/><br/>That's season 1.Season 2 was not the lead's life's work. So in the wake of season 1, season 2 looked thin. But time has given season 2 virtue. It stands alone as a very clever mystery. Vince Vaughn was just good when he may have had a opportunity to ascend into the heights of Rustin Cohle. He missed that mark but hit his blocks. I kinda think the actors all took separate cabs each day to and from the shoot. They didn't bring off screen chemistry anyway.But hey, it's been 5 long years with nothing as good as season 2. The more time season 2 ages, it achieves independence from season 1 and gets its own renown. The fact that the seasons are not connected each other makes it possible to divide them:<br/><br/>Season 1: 10
The first season is the best so far, a full ten, well acted, well written, well directed.
A truly masterpiece<br/><br/>Season 2: 6
The second season falls down becoming way too much boring, the plot is actually a little poor and sometimes makes no sense. While we can save Farrel's interpretation he can't alone save the whole show. You could actually jump from s01 to s03 with no harm done.<br/><br/>Season 3: 9
I was so scared that s03 could be like s02 but luckily it looks like they've come back on the right path.
Ali is a great actor and the whole plot is enjoyable.
It doesn't go as high as s01 but surely that's a real "True Detective" season. As with the first two seasons, True Detective 3 moves at a glacier's pace, apparently to make the story seem way more earth-shattering than it is.<br/><br/>I was not interested in the story at all for the first four episodes and almost gave up. But I became mildly interested over the last four episodes, mostly because of the terrific acting from all concerned, way better acting than the script deserved.<br/><br/>But yes, I had to have closed-captioning on throughout in order to understand all the mumbling.<br/><br/>A 9 for acting and a 2 for story nets TD Season 3 a 5 overall from me. I would like to say there was another TV series that evoked an emotional response from me like True Detective did, but unfortunately there is not. I've spent many an hour infatuated on the first series, how the ever spinning tale of religious cults, the burgeon of anxiety and stress involved in being a detective. I find myself relating to most of Rust Cohles Spiels, from his interpretation of religion to his insight of the human condition. True Detective season 1 is a cinematic marvel, nothing has come close to it as of yet. I have to give this an overall rating of 5 for this, allow me to explain the reasons...<br/><br/>the first series was a masterpiece of great acting, writing, suspense and intrigue and definitely 10 out of 10 for me... unfortunately the second series had none of this and I opted to not watch the last couple of episodes as I felt my life passing by, truly terrible, possibly the most boring show I have ever watched, nothing happened and it got to the point where I just didn't care any more.<br/><br/>do yourself a favour watch the first series and give the second a wide, wide berth. It takes a lot of money to make a show like this with a wonderful cast that unfortunately gets lost in an overly complicated story.
Too little happens each hour to hold ones interest. So far (episode 3) the third season is boring. Too bad. The crime-drama to completely redeem the television genre and set the bar for future series.<br/><br/>True Detective centers around the lives of two homicide detectives, Rustin Cohle and Martin Hart, in rural Louisiana as they hunt for a serial killer.<br/><br/>Rustin (Rust) Cohle, Matthew McConaughey, is newly transferred from a narcotics division in Texas and is partnered with Martin Hart, Woody Harrelson, for their first big case together. The homicide detectives are called onto a particularly grisly and bizarre murder scene with an occult undertone unlike anything their southern Louisiana parish has witnessed. Told in equal parts past, the early 1990′s while investigating the case, and present, Rust and Martin being interviewed about the case, viewers are brought along to follow the case, how it transgresses and how the dynamic of Rust and Martin change as a partnership.<br/><br/>Short for a television series, containing only eight one-hour episodes, True Detective is nothing like you've seen before on television that is billed as a 'crime drama.' There is a cinematic quality to the show and its creator Nic Pizzolatto relies upon extraordinary storytelling, intelligent dialogue, a wholly cohesive vision, and incredibly engaging and complex characters. Director Cary Fukunaga is an integral part of creating the foreboding backwoods setting and suspenseful tone with one compelling action scene in particular, lasting six minutes and technically sensational (honorable mention to all crew associated with orchestrating this scene in episode four, especially camera operator Chris TJ Mcguire) shot entirely in one continuous uncut shot marveling any acclaimed film.<br/><br/>I am so incredibly thankful for this collaboration and brain child of the writer, director and stars – who all also executive produce the series. It is cerebral, philosophical, and the crime is hauntingly sinister. The main characters are complex, far beyond the good cop/bad cop dichotomy, each with different convictions and demons. The supporting roles are equally rich in their character development.<br/><br/>In the end you will not know the resolution until the end of the very last episode.<br/><br/>True Detective will be marked as a particular moment in television where a show chose to move past being an episodic series that is deemed successful and straight to film-making legend. I dare you to watch the first episode and not be compelled by curiosity to close the intricate case.<br/><br/>Find more television reviews by season, series and episode at our website! I've never reviewed anything on IMDb before but as season 3 was so bad, I just had to sign up just to say my bit. I struggled with episodes 1 and 2, went to bed before the end of episode 3 and finally gave up half way through episode 4.<br/><br/>
Moody boring dialogue taking you across three timescales going round in circles. If I wanted my brain numbed that much I could have watched the dog chasing it's tail or paint drying. I'm normally not a quitter... lasted until season 9 episode 9 of Walking Dead,.....probably 4 seasons too many.<br/><br/>So disappointing after season 1 (10/10) and 2 (7/10) - please spare us any more! A truly remarkable visceral experience that captured my attention from the very beginning. Through the tumultuous adventures of Hart and Cohle I was finally able to appreciate what is my favourite television series to date. I was riveted and thoroughly invested in the series until the very end and several sequences in the finale episode left me shuddering with emotions that I haven't experienced before. It would be a sin not to watch this show. The thematic vision behind this body of work is a masterpiece in itself but to translate such ideas so thoroughly and seamlessly to actual film is bewildering to say the least. To Nic Pizzolatto, the cast and the crew I am indebted to you for bringing this to the world, thank you. There's a line in 48 HOURS when Nick Nolte points out to Eddie Murphy that, even though Murphy's been given a $500 suit, he's still a piece of pond scum. Eddie responds, "Yeah, but I look GREAT!". With TRUE DETECTIVE, the American movie and TV public serves as the people that Murphy's 48 HOURS character hopes to impress. The work itself is the dazzling $500 suit. Sort of like an inverted Emperor's New Clothes. Hopefully there are a few Noltes' out there that will recognize that T-D is a vapid, glib, superficial and facetious effort designed to package prodigious amounts of style and cool over top of.... well, nothing . I'm not sure if I've ever seen such a straightforward attempt to blind an audience with absolutely nothing other than melodrama, charisma, and glitz. I got a hoot out of reading the "10" Comments here on IMDb. Hypnotized and gushing with plenty of adjectives but conspicuously lacking in any substantive description. Stick a dead fish in a nice vase and from a distance it looks, well .... GREAT. Just don't get too close.<br/><br/>PS / Even the title TRUE DETECTIVE is pretentious.<br/><br/>PPS / WHEW! I'm gonna get a lot of heat for this COMMENT! First of all, I don't write many reviews on IMDb, in fact this is my first one while visiting the site for the past 5/6 years.<br/><br/>The reason I write one for this particular series after only 3 episodes is unclear even for me but I felt the need to write.<br/><br/>Let me start by re-iterating what some might have already said about this show. It is not a fast paced action packed 24-type of show. So if you want to see a show where you can just turn off your brain and watch some mind-numbing entertainment, this one is not it.<br/><br/>So far in my life I have only seen one series that I can honestly say satisfied me to my core. And that is The Wire. It is up there on a pedestal for me all on it's own. And below that is everything else. Well now, maybe the reason I'm writing this is because I have this feeling I may have found another one! Granted it is early to say, only 3 episodes in but for the first time in a long time I was watching and while being dragged into the story more and more, I was dreading that it was only one episode and then I had to stop watching and wait another week. I wanted to know more about those characters and how they look at the world, especially Rusty. That hasn't happened to me in a long time. It felt so human, so real.<br/><br/>The first two episodes didn't really point me in any direction as to what my opinion of this show would be and I didn't think much of it honestly. Just enough to give it a chance and see where it goes. Unlike many other crap shows that after 5 minutes you know are a total waste of time, this one didn't come across as crap. But it didn't really put any big plot in front to wounder about (whodunnit?), as most shows do in their pilot, to essentially set up the format for the next how ever many seasons the studio bosses decide to air it. This one just left me wondering, are they going somewhere with this or? Which is a sign that it's either gonna be a total failure by trying too hard to be different, or it is gonna be something really special and actually tell a story.<br/><br/>Granted, I should trust HBO that they wouldn't make something like that with Woody and Matt without some story to tell. Well now, after this third episode I am becoming convinced. This is a very deep series. It will not be for everyone I reckon, because it is quite intellectual at times and requires a decent amount of thinking capacity to appreciate the depth (10$ words as Woody Harrelson's character puts it :)) but if you can I strongly urge you to give it a chance. If you liked The Wire for the same reasons I did (intelligence, depth of characters, ...), my guess is you will like this as well. I for one am sold. Thank you once again HBO! Is it something with HBO the last year? This along with with Sharp Objects I was only able to make it through 1 1/2 episodes of each series. They are just slowwwwww, sad, sad,drudgery. Everyone is so depressed. I didnt see one smile. A monotonous bore.
My oh my how could anyone sit through 8 episodes of this show. I know a show sucks when I pick up my tablet during the show checking email.
Somebody give the writer a bottle of antidepressants fast. I watch series and movies without captions. This show is great, but also this season we have a mumbler. Mahershala Ali is a great actor but I do not understand 50% when he speaks. These reviewers who give this show poor rating and calling it boring and so on, probably have CSI as their favorite TV show and Fast and Furious as their favorite movie. Of course this would be "boring"<br/><br/>and "slow paced" show for them. Leave this show to people who love great atmosphere, cinematography,acting and plot and everyone will be happy. Give this one a pass fellas, not for ya'.<br/><br/>Back to the review witch will be brief (I just got sick of all of these "critics", so I had to say something). After watching first two episodes I can say I am officially hooked. I can't wait for the next episodes. I love the atmosphere, it reminds me of one of my all time favorite movies, Seven, so that is a plus in my book. The acting is superb. I was not fan of MMcC because of his "chick flicks", but he blew me away in this role. I must say I am more interested in what happened to both of these detectives and their characters during and after the murder, then to find the actual killer. Anyway, this is probably the best start of a TV show in the past couple of years. The only downfall is the length of this first season. Other than that 10 stars from me. I just finished episode 5 of 8 for season 3. Basically, it is a show about an angry white man and an even angrier black man, who are both angry, being angry about everything and also being angry at everyone.<br/><br/>If that sounds like fun, watch season 3. True Detective was an absolutely incredible crime series! Like most others here this is mostly based off Season 1. Season 3 was pretty good and Season 2, even though it had an amazing cast, was not worth watching! There has never been nothing like Season 1 in the history of TV. I'm not saying it's the best show I've ever seen but it's on the list! Season one is soooooooooo legit. Everything about the show is superb. I am not sure how this happened but the first season was phenomoennal and then all of a sudden BOOM, it was just crap. Definitely watch season 1 but then just stop...or go for a walk. Season one is great , Matthew McConaughey killed it
season two is absolutely horrible , boring and not worth watching , season three was kinda good . Not sure if its an acting trend these days or just the lead roll in season 3 but it would help if the viewers could understand his muffled lines. So frustrating having to re-wind to try to understand the actors lines. Sandwich model<br/><br/>Good things There is an amusing line once in a while but you have to wait for it<br/><br/>Bad things Watch first and second episode I got a few questions 1. In the investigation room....is there a plot hidden in the coffee muck? 2. Did the writers of the show forgot it had the word "detective" in the title? 3. Is there to much money in TV shows now a days so that the producers think "If we take two really good actors and put them in a crappy BUT somehow mysterious Hannibal/twinpeak/rachel getting married it will be a blast" 4. How many episodes do I have to watch before something interesting is going to happen? 5. I wonder if the writers know the terms Cliché? There comes a new detective to the precinct no one likes him, no one wants him, he is haunted, haunted by an episode so fatal and injustice he have to drink, use drugs, and worst of all HE CANT SLEEP. REALLY is that the best you can come up with.... how hard can it be to find something new and interesting?<br/><br/>Good things It is truly boring and I will continue use it as a sleeping pill 10 minutes watching and I am in my own detective story I've just finished watching the 3rd episode and holy cow! The only word fit to describe this show is 'perfect'. The writing is brilliant, one of the best I've ever seen; the characters are complex and really well developed; the directing is just outstanding, such beautiful camera angles, such immersive atmosphere, such great suspense. <br/><br/>I just gotta warn you though, if you want an action packet investigation show, this is not your thing. And if you like common, super moral and one-dimensional main characters, this is also not your thing. <br/><br/>Now, if you want a show with complex characters, deep philosophical reflections, great suspense, brilliant directing and a narrative that takes it's time, this is definitely your thing. In my opinion this is the greatest show airing on TV right now. A soon to become another HBO classic! To start with, i didn't find it slow at all. It was really intense and interesting, it keeps you off the edge of your seat. As to who is the murderer is an interesting question, it makes the show more mysterious therefore it makes it much more interesting. After monitoring this show for a while it was definitely worth the wait and this is just the beginning. For those who are hesitant to watch it, give it a go because its definitely worth it! The scenario is great and the acting is probably its most noticeable aspect as the acting is just genuinely amazing. It is a bit dark which makes it bad-ass, also it kind of reminds me of Se7en. Ps, Rust is an insane bad-ass. I'm a big fan of the first season. Everything about it was magnificent. Charming South, darkest and horrible deeds of the people, wrong choices. The creator really got to his title and actually created the warm, slow yet very violent atmosphere. So I expected the second season to see, how the crew could succeed in a tough business of leveling to the stuff they put so high in the first season.<br/><br/>I was actually scared by the reviews like "it's awful while the first one was perfect". Thank God I gave it a try.<br/><br/>Slow pace - definitely. The whole first episode introduces the area of play. Nothing is really happening. Yet the music fills the picture and you see the characters unroll. You see the depth and you get prepared for what's gonna come and blow you away.<br/><br/>The story feels very realistic. Nic Pizolatto didn't lose the grip on the paintbrush and delivers a very true performance revealing the motives and consequences of someone deeds.<br/><br/>The second season is another example of very high standard television. Thanks to everyone involved. Actors, composers, directors were all fantastic. Hope there's something else left for a third turn. HBO has done it again. Although this show will not be for everyone, i believe it has real potential to be something special. It has absolutely incredible writing, acting and character development. Some viewers will be annoyed or disappointed in the pace of the show but thats where some of the real beauty and art resides. Real police cases aren't solved overnight nor are they continual gun fights like so many viewers crave. The story is filled with ominous tones and feels like real police case playing out before us. we get a glimpse inside the lives of the so- called "good-guys" if only to find out its sometimes just as dark and disturbing as the monsters they hunt. The characters are deep and complex, Mcconaughey and harrelson are magnificent in reminding us that Nobody is ever purely good or evil, we all reside in some sort of indescribable Grey area. Its gritty, its dark, its disturbing. Its Human Nature written and acted to perfection. Looked sooo forward to this.. but such a disappointment..
Half of the time couldn't make up what they were saying..
Adored season 1, had to get used to season 2 but turned out fairly good.. but this one is a real miss.
Slow, boring, unsatisfying ending.. was distracted so many times.. checkin email in between watching.. this cant be the goal of a good series..
One plus.. the make up of the old Hays.. very well done!<br/><br/>Too bad.. How does this absolute pile of trash have a rating of 9.3? There goes my faith in trusting IMDb ratings... Where do I even start with this terrible mess.<br/><br/>I have watched three episodes and I just cannot continue. I wanted to like this show, I really did, everyone seems to give it high praise, but I just cannot watch another episode. I don't think I'd watch it if I was paid. It's so boring. Why do people like this rubbish?<br/><br/>By the end of Episode 3 we haven't even seen an antagonist or any person that seems to be a bad guy. There's only 8 episodes, HURRY IT UP ALREADY! Every character mumbles their lines in this show. This makes it really frustrating to watch as you have to listen out extra carefully, you might want to put subtitles on if you're watching this. Not one interesting or decent event has occurred by the end of episode 3. No action, no story, no nothing. The story also jumps about all over the place going back to the present and then the past every ten minutes or so. Stick to the past will you! Why don't those detectives just get the details they need? No one cares or needs to know anything about a boring dinner conversation.<br/><br/>At the end of Episode 2 we learn of this church where we assume this bad cult has its meetings to carry out their executions. I wonder if the show will leave us on a cliffhanger... And so we wait and what are we given? A boring painting on a wall... Is this meant to make me want to watch the next episode? Hey writers and makers of the show, if you only have eight episodes to work with, not having any action or a bad guy nearly halfway through the series isn't good storytelling!<br/><br/>What am I meant to be interested in? The characters? It's difficult to like characters that mumble every line so you can't even hear what they say. Boring, monotone, drone characters with no like ability. Don't waste your time on this it's so boring please don't watch it. Unless you want to watch boring people mumble lines so you can't hear them properly or if you like stories with no action, bad guys or cliffhangers, then this show might be for you! "I wasn't blown away" and "I'll consider it" are the responses I got from fellow TV amateurs like myself when I asked them what they thought about True Detective's pilot, which was what led me to watch it without high expectations. I was wrong. I could tell from the opening that this show was going to be enjoyable. You can tell a lot about a show from its composers' choice of music.<br/><br/>A mixture of strong performances, a gloomy setting, and a mysterious opening scene is exactly what I needed. Harrelson and McConaughey's performance is just top notch, you couldn't ask for more. I was disappointed to know this is an anthology series for I wished to see more of these two in future seasons, but eight episodes are more than enough for me. We've been blown away by modern shows like Breaking Bad, shows which were really on-par with the standards set by The Sopranos and The Wire, and I think True Detective is a show that is going to repeat the cycle. I truly hope this show only gets better. Season 1 was stunning, Season 2 was OK but Season 3 was appallingly bad. Most of the time it was impossible to understand what was being said, just incoherent mumbling. The cast was the most boring set characters imaginable. Please, please no Season 4. I am really sorry to write this. I was so excited after the first season. It was amazing, there was action, drama, thriller, everything you wanted was there and even more. I was so glad to watch it and sad at the same time, knowing that I have to wait a year for the second season. I was waiting and I was full of doubt that this kind of masterpiece cannot be repeated so easily and unfortunately I was right. I like the cast, but I think that the scenario is poor and thin. All of the actors are playing very artificially. Vince's character I don't have any idea what is this superman that everybody is afraid of. It is so poorly written that I would have rejected this role to save my career if I was on his place. The story is so confusing and full of holes that I cannot express my disgrace. I was hoping, hoping and I can honestly say that I am glad that soon it is over and I will wait for hopefully better 3rd season. After finishing the 4th episode now i can't but congratulate on everybody involved in this. Pulling off a such tight drama can break so easily as it depends so much on subtlety. And yet this one is done brilliantly.<br/><br/>The cast is just pure excellency. McConaughey is stunning as the broken, disillusioned pragmatist with a loose mouth. Harrelson compliments him perfectly as the good-willed but utterly dysfunctional family man, who doesn't questions his values even if he breaks them himself. And the "seven"-esque odyssey of these two challenged men to find the killer of a girl leads past all kinds of bizarre characters, each of them appropriately well performed by (did i mention?) a great cast.<br/><br/>All this is set against an amazingly shot south states scenery, in which the moral of the people sometimes seems to be as empty and unstable as the landscape. The soundtrack finally wraps it up beautifully. It maintains a macabre yet captivating and gritty atmosphere of self-deception, self-serving hedonism and questionable morals while never playing itself into the front. <br/><br/>So yea, i've hardly ever seen the saying "perfection is met when you can't take anything away" carried out better than in this series. I can't even describe how much i'm sitting on nails here waiting for the next episode to come out. If you like Dark, if you like Noir, this is kind of a modern Noir.With a twist of crazy. Is Matthew McConoughey's character Rust Cohle, homicide detective and former undercover Narc,crazy? Or is his intelligence, probably off the charts, just what seems crazy? Whatever, he says some really cool things. Things that make you think. Maybe he's representative of an alienated spirit that resides, a little bit at least, in all of us. He is definitely disappointed by life and has rationalized his way out of the human race. Who hasn't felt that way? The difference is Rust Cohle feels that way ALL the time.<br/><br/>His senior partner, Martin Hart, played by Woody Harrelson, is the "sane" side of the partnership. He has a streak of kindness and believes in the world he sees.Like most of us do. He is a family man and tries to live up to what is expected of him. Cohle doesn't live by what anyone expects of him. He probably has no idea of what he expects of himself either. I don't want to minimize Harrelson's part. He has his own deepness within that All-American Dream of being somebody who did right. Who raised his kids right, treated his wife right, has a sense of moral duty, earns enough for a middle class life. In other words, wife,family,house,and picket fence. Only he is a homicide cop and he CAN'T QUITE pull it off.<br/><br/>Michelle Monaghan is beautiful. She is Maggie, Martin's wife. Martin has a knockout wife, and yet things are not always so good. I hope they expand her role, who, at present, is a ticked-off wife of a cop, Marty, who cares about his job, and can't stand his in-laws.<br/><br/>Oh My God, is Alexandra Dadario a knockout. One punch, you're out. Check out the second episode.<br/><br/>There is actually humor in this dark show. How could there not be some, when Marty and his partner, Rust, are exact opposites, or Marty thinks they are. The question is what will happen next in their attempt to solve the bizarre murder they are presented with in the First Episode.<br/><br/>This is an anthology series which means the characters and actors will change from season to season. The writer and creator, Nick Pizzolatto, has created and written a great show here. I gave it a try for the first five episodes. I then realized i was watching the same episode all over again. Nothing happens, the story doesn't evolve at all in no direction, not for any of the characters nor the plot, whatsoever. What you'll see is McConaughey talking as if his mouth is full of chewing tobacco while he drinks beer and talks about god knows what. Then there's Harrelson for whom nobody really cares.<br/><br/>This is boring, slow paced and useless. And stop comparing this to Breaking Bad, because if you do then you haven't watch it, that's for sure. Season one killed it, better than expected, even though had high recommendations.. every episode was a different tenssioned emotional journey.. after finished watching it was in my head and mind for a long time.. Couldn't wait for second season..which was a total disappointment... the cast , was great, but there was no connection between the characters, no plot, no chemistry .. waste of time. Finally season 3... I binged my self for a month to watch it.. still feeling the bad taste from previous one.. but.. I was surprised, from first 3 minutes of watching it got me all in, my full attention, my mind, head and heart) Loved it.! So whoever watched first one, skip the second and watch the 3rd season!! Watch the first season. It is one of the best shows ever. Original and very scary.
The first season stands alone. The other two seasons are trash. They make no sense and are a waste of time. I really wanted to like this and add to the "rave" reviews. I always do a bit of research about unknown quantities such as this.<br/><br/>I thought this would tick all the boxes based on the sheer volume of rave reviews and 9s and 10s. It worked for Breaking Bad and Broadwalk Empire and Narcos after all but this is simply not in the same league as the above mentioned. Nowhere near.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. There is some extremely strong acting performances, especially another superb method performance from MM but its too slow and just didn't hold my interest.<br/><br/>Quite simply. TD is boring and slow and predictable to a point.<br/><br/>Maybe I need to give it another go in a fre months but not sure, I will bother.<br/><br/>I will say that I am only a quarter through the penultimate episode but there is no way that whatever happens in the next 90 mins will cover over the cracks of the previous 375 or thereabouts.<br/><br/>Like I said at the beginning. Really wanted to like/love this but its average and from what I hear about s2. Geez I won't be going anywhere near that if S1 is 9+ out of 10 and thats 2!<br/><br/>Best box sets i order for me are<br/><br/>Gomorrah
Sopranos
Narcos
Breaking Bad
Boardwalk Empire
Band of Brothers
Ripper Street
Prison Break
And a few more I can't think of right now but certainly not this.<br/><br/>Not seen GOT yet This show is a big hitter, i don't think i have been hit this hard by dialog before, maybe it has more to do with where i am in my life than its genuine mass appeal, but this thing has been well thought through regardless. This show actually means something on many levels, they have tapped into a vein of contemporary existential dread and complexity immediate to everyone's lives, so much so that the actual murder investigation becomes a subplot in my eyes.<br/><br/>Anyone who has ever tried to understand their life outside of the constraints that society presents to them(that's practically all of us), will empathize with the struggle of Matthew McConaughey's character, and that's where i believe the show will gather most of its appeal from. I just hope they don't disappoint me with where they take him...maybe the proverbial question has been answered many times before (reason vs instinct) and i hope it's different this time, but i fear it wont be. More to the point, it cant be, they can only pose the question, but they're doing a crazy fine job of posing it thus far.<br/><br/>10/10 Matthew McConaughey mumbles so much in this role I missed the final line of the final episode. Totally unintelligible. Something about stars, which is a good alternative title to this overrated series.<br/><br/>9.4 it rates on IMDb! You got be kidding me. The presence of an A-lister or two has blinded everyone's ability to see the flaws in this series. So much of it is ponderous, repetitive and just plain unnecessary. It needed severe editing, especially the tedious interviews, and doesn't really get going until episode 5 or 6. The first four episodes could easily have been merged into one.<br/><br/>I'm giving it one-star, simply because some perspective is needed here, though I did watch to the end, which, though a chore at times, was eventually rewarding. Interesting well-developed characters, moody cinematography, and an attempt to make this a psychological thriller, not just the usual action cop cliché, puts it ahead of the pack. But ultimately, it really is just the same old serial killer fare in an arty grunge T-shirt. The stars do a fine job on the whole, despite some brooding overacting from McConaughey at times, and annoying cud-chewing from Harrelson, but True Detective is a long way from great. The final episode paves the way for a sequel with talk of more killers that haven't been caught yet, but I won't be watching. I am sure it would be good if I could understand one word of what Ali says..in whatever age he is playing the character! I just re-watched Season 2. Don't get me wrong, I did like Season 1 as well but it has no re-watch potential. Season 2 is just life.. the beautifully displayed desperation in so many levels. With an occasional glimpse of hope. I've seen a lot of great shows like Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, Sherlock, Sopranos, Walking Dead, Dexter, but this... This one probably beats them all.<br/><br/>I agree with others, who say, that True Detective is not for everyone, because it is. Its dark, multi-layered complex plot really demands big attention on every detail.<br/><br/>But this show is really amazing. Everything is made and selected perfectly: cinematography, soundtracks, plot, cast, script - everything brilliant. And I have no words to describe how Matthew McCaunaghey's character is amazing.<br/><br/>For me, this show is some kind of mix of legendary movies as Se7en and No Country For Old Man.<br/><br/>What a surprise. Must see one. I truly believe this series is way overrated. They are trying SO hard to convince people that this is something special. I don't have many things to say, I have watched the 7 episodes of the 8 in total episodes of season 1 and nothing happens. Each episode so far(the whole season almost) has a bunch of unrelated situations were they spend the most of the time, instead of focusing on the case...and all these unrelated situations are again boring... what is the point of making all this? even if the last episode is fantastic(I doubt!!!), thats only 1/8 that would be a good episode. all the other episodes are zero. No more to say, most boring TV series I have seen in my life..sorry...... Everybody is raving about this series but not me. I have to admit, the photography and music is brilliant, but that is about all I find attractive. First of all we have Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey. They desperately try to impress with their acting capabilities and that ruins it for me. Woody constantly does this stubborn and willful mouth pose, like he had a stoke, which I find really annoying. A good actor doesn't need a pose or a gimmick. It has to shine through. Matthew, especially the flash back scenes, is so dreadful serious and long-winded I just cant take another episode. Woody and Matthew play characters who want to be "authentic"...but their authenticity is obnoxiously pondered, and feels very forced. The producers probably watched Scandinavian crime series with outspoken personalities and wanted to copy this aspect. Well, Americans can't be Europeans and shouldn't try to. After watching several episodes I realize I really don't care if a suspect is arrested or not. I don't care who the killed woman was. Besides, I am not impressed with the devilish worshiping scenery of the victim. After watching all seasons Dexter I know what murder staging is, and that was pretty awesome in Dexter and the staging in True Detective feels like mustard after dinner. Awesome storyline, superior acting, screenplay was amazing, and they did NOT blow the ending. If you're looking for something to fill up your tube and you like realistic whodunits, you will never top this one! This crime drama is centred on two Louisiana detectives, Marty Hart and Rust Cohle and their investigation of a particularly disturbing murder. A woman's naked body was found at a remote location; posed with a stag's antlers on her head and with strange 'stick sculptures' nearby. This crime took place in 1995 and we are shown it in flashback as other officers interview them about the case in 2012. Inevitably as the season progresses the plot deepens, more potential victims emerge along with various suspects.<br/><br/>If you like your crime drama to be fast paced and action packed then this might not be for you; it moves at a fairly slow pace. This doesn't mean it is boring though; quite the opposite. I was gripped from start to finish. While there isn't a lot of action there is some and occasionally there are sudden moments of shocking violence. As much as the story is about solving a crime it is about its effects on our two protagonists; Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey really impress in these roles. The latter is particularly good as Cohle is so different in 1995 and 2012. The series has a great look with the Louisiana scenery almost being another character... it looks as if nature is just waiting to take over. As the story approaches its conclusion it employs tropes one might expect in a horror film leading me to wonder about the safety of Marty and Rust. Overall I'd definitely recommend watching this; this season has a proper conclusion so it can be enjoyed on its own; on the strength of this I'll watch further seasons given the chance. One of the best series that i've ever watch, everything is just so perfect. I've only watched the season one and man that was brilliant. And also i have no plan to watch the next seasons. Not say the third series was poor but it wasnt in the same league as series one and two but saying that series 2 was no where near as good as series one.
The third series was ruined by the quiet and muffled dialogue particularly from the lead character. So bad that I had to watch with sub-titles.
Hopefully if there is a fourth series we return to the standards of series one. True Detective season 1 is undoubtedly the best 8 episodes that you´re gonna see in a series, with great actings, a very interesting plot, and a very cool soundtrack , the best of McConaughey and Harrelson is here, this is not the typical detective show, because this is 1000 times better.The series deals with many issues at once and does it very well, loisiana's environment fits the series quite well,you don't take long to empathize with the two protagonists, you care what might happen to them,and when care about the characters, you like the series or movie. Unlike other series True Detective dont waste his time with silly subplots,or showing you unnecesary things, the series is very realistic,is a masterpiece and if dont agree with me,well i really dont care,you can go away to see your boring and mediocre series like Lost, Stranger things,sense 8, and that kind of series that 90 percent of people love so much I'm suprised that this show doesn't get far more attention than it does. I have never before seen a show that has characters that feel so complex and real. Not to mention the incredible philosophy of pessimism explained by probably the greatest character on TV, Rustin Cohle. How the actual can a character be this good. It is mindblowing. How can any show be this good. I don't know, but it is Can it be any slower?! And let's make sure not to enunciate anything and try extra hard to mumble instead... So I long time ago I watched S1 and fell in love with it, absolutely amazing, and caused me to rate this show a 10/10.<br/><br/>But now coming to the ending of S3 the show fell off, stories and characters got less interesting, and the show started to drag. S2 was the worst of the bunch, whilst still being okay in its own right, it felt different.<br/><br/>Now S3, talk about a unfulfilling case, characters and story. I went into this expecting better, but the story was hardly engrossing and towards the last few episodes I was just watching to get it over with. Sadly the finale left me unfulfilled as well. Maybe this is what they wanted, the characters don't have closure, so don't you.<br/><br/>Directing was decent though, primarily very pretty show, but not so good regarding movement and suspense. The whole dementia aspect was kind of there, but also not. The two cops lacked a bit of synergy. Whilst both performances we're very good, especially considering the different ages they needed to play.<br/><br/>Now that I mentioned suspense, I never felt it, in S1 I distinctly remember the suspense and creepiness. Whilst S3 is not really creepy at all and the crimes are really tame, it lacks suspense. And what makes detective shows interesting? That overhanging suspense of what the hell is going on.<br/><br/>Some holes left empty for me: Henry cheating story goes nowhere, Amelia's death is not explained, The boss of the chicken farm isn't touched upon really how he acted in the plot. Interviewer plot kinda petered off oddly.<br/><br/>S1: 10/10 (must watch)
S2: 6/10
S3: 7/10<br/><br/>I should lower my rating on IMDB..but it feels like a disservice to season 1.<br/><br/>Hopefully they are able to strike gold again like S1 with S4, if that is coming. Because otherwise I think this is where I leave it. First of all I gotta say, season 1 was amazing. Season 2 was ok/meh. Now for the killshot. Season 3 was the biggest snorefest ever. A complete waste of time. I said to my wife several times during a marathon viewing, I'd rather watch daytime soap operas.
If they decide on the 4th series, I will give it 1 or 2 episodes to decide, but I am not holding my breath. If the individual seasons were rate-able, as they should be, S03 would get 4 stars in my book. S01 was a masterwork of story telling and suspense and truly earned its 10 star rating. S02 was a good story but wasnt in the same league as S01, neither in content nor context, and was a solid 7 stars. S03 is back to its original form with the paralel timelines and detective duo and failed relationship, alcoholism, and the murder/missing child case that loomed over their lifetime, but falls seriously short of any other resemblances. The acting is excellent throughout all seasons which says more about the actors than the series. The writing in S01 was tight and to the point, S02 went in a different direction than S01 but still had solid writing that kept a good pace throughout the season. S03, on the the other hand, was written not for suspense or intrigue or mystery or anything else I can summize, but for some sort of romantic familial healing learning lesson of some sort. No detecting at all in S03 as everything is handed to you in between slow moving couples quarels, deep intense self realizations and deep staring off or into the camera, and family therapy. Thats about as much suspense as S03 delivers and not even in a good story, plot, or theme, fashion. I was happy with season 3's Double ep start..After the very disappointing Season 2 it seemed we were getting back on track.Unfortunately ep. 3 is so slow and disjointed I fear it may not recover.The performance of the lead Actor is the only reason I have given it a rating of 7.Mahershala Ali could read his shopping list and be brilliant.I hope it DOES recover but atm nothing surpasses season 1 which I rated 10/10 True Detective is a masterful twist of the murder mystery and elements of supernatural horror, one that takes the viewer on a hauntingly dark and twisted journey. As the opening credits play with the song "Far From Any Road" by The Handsome Family, the viewer knows this is going to be quite a ride. If anyone is expecting a cop drama with plenty of action, you may be disappointed. For those intrigued by True Detective, a lot of patience is required at the start, but I promise you that every episode keeps getting better.<br/><br/>In a stroke of brilliant casting, Matthew McConaughey (Detective Rust Cohle) and Woody Harrelson (Detective Marty Hart) are two Louisiana State Police homicide detectives investigating a bizarre ritualistic murder of an unidentified woman which may be the work of a serial killer. The series jumps between 2012 and 1995 where they are questioned by two police detectives (Michael Potts and Tory Kittles) to when they first investigate the murder and then work to track down a serial killer.<br/><br/>As the series continues on, we learn that both detectives are very professional and good at their jobs, but both have their flaws and skeletons in their closets. Detective Rust Cole is a very intelligent, talented and dedicated detective, yet he is deeply troubled by his dark and mysterious past and lives a depressed and solitary life. Detective Marty Hart is an easy going police detective who is well liked and respected by police superiors and other fellow detectives, however his home life is in turmoil. Marty often cheats on his wife (Michelle Monaghan) with younger women, one of his daughters is rebelling against him, and he is constantly having big nights on the booze.<br/><br/>Through a number of fateful incidents, the investigation stalls and both men go their separate ways. Fast forward to 2012 and the investigation is resurrected, with Rust Cohle and Marty Hart narrating what occurred from 1995 onwards with their investigation and pursuit of the serial killer.<br/><br/>The creator of the series has done an excellent job bringing to the TV screens a top notch series, something that could have possible been made into a novel or shortened completely to a movie which would not feel the same. Cinematography is breathtakingly amazing. The entire story takes you by the hand and guides you through the entire journey, not letting you go for one moment.<br/><br/>For those that continue to watch the series, I promise you that each episode gets better and better. In the end, you will feel rewarded. This is an excellent series. HBO should be congratulated on a job well done.<br/><br/>Looking forward to Season 2 with a new story, new cast, and a new location. <br/><br/>A well deserved 10/10. One, the acting is superb, with the absorbing chemistry between the characters Rutsin Cohle and Marty Hart; who are portrayed by Matthew McConaghey. It felt like it was too time-consuming to change the disc and by the time you waited for the new episode to come on, you are relieved, because the show is like your favorite movie. Loved every minute of it, I hope whoever is "iffy" on watching this show and read my review enjoy it, hell, I hope every person enjoys or enjoyed this show. Variety says it's, "Rich and absorbing... Unlike almost anything on TV." And the Chicago Tribune said it was, "Mesmerizing... excels in every way." Knockout cast and great writing and cinematography really exceeded everything I thought the show was going to be, there is nothing like it and I hope there are more shows like it in the future. Right now, this is my number one favorite show ever. Matthew McConaughey makes Rusty Cole character so freaking good I almost fell off the chair.<br/><br/>The atmosphere that begins in episode one and goes through the whole show is just amazing and the biggest reasons I think, is the character of Rusty Cole. And it isn't JUST the character that does it, Im pretty sure that no one could do Rusty better than McConaughey. Woody Harrelson isn't bad at all. But his character isn't that involved in the atmosphere as much as McConaughey is.<br/><br/>Although I think the atmosphere and characters are two of the things that makes this show so good, the story is pretty good too (ha ha). True Detective started off as something I didn't think much of when I watched the previews and after watching the first episode I was BLOWN AWAY. It had so much depth and broke so much boundaries, Matthew McConaughey gives the performance of his career, in my opinion it was much better than Dallas Buyers Club. How can I forget Woody Harrelson, he truly did surprise me as Marty Hart, I no longer see him as Mickey Knox or Larry Flynt in two of his best roles. Woody Harrelson is Marty Hart! Besides their differences, Rust Cole and Marty Hart make an amazing team, one of the greatest pairs in television history. Also Nic Pizzolatto's writing is the most beautiful,dark, and twisted thing I've ever seen on screen. In addition, it is fascinating to see the transition the characters go through as the years go by, 95' to 02' to 2012 we get to see the characters change and get deeper, they also get more interesting. I anticipated the next episode every single week, i couldn't stop raving about how GREAT this shows is, was, and will be. How do you judge a series which starts brilliantly, cooks up great theories and possibilities, but in the end shows up many plot holes and ends tamely? Should we hail it as brilliant, just because the two leads give wonderful performances?Can it be termed as an art because of the many brooding, grim, dark camera shots?<br/><br/>True Detective is a puzzle in itself.If the writer wanted it to be a character study of it's leads, then it should have been just that.It shouldn't have put emphasis on a great crime and an even greater conspiracy.Cause all through the seven episodes it does that and in the last fifteen minutes of the eight, completely shifts itself to being about Marty Hart and Rust Cohle.No satisfying explanations are given about the crimes, about the cult, about the murders.Mind you all the while (esp in the last few episodes) the detectives conveniently stumble on answers.And we are left with a fairly standard deranged, inbred villain.<br/><br/>This first season had so much potential, but doesn't fulfill it.It is even sadder, that it has achieved some sort of a cult status.There are many series better and smarter than this. Series wanders more each year it drags on, Acting is great. Cinematography is great. Very realistic, Story is kinda, eh?? Supposedly hard-boiled, Viet-Nam vet detectives are haunted by case for 30-40 years?<br/><br/>Series has jumped the shark. As some other reviewers have noted, the only way I'm enjoying this is by having to use the subtitles to see what's being said. Seems many newer actors are adopting this "speak as low as possible in the most monotonous tone you can come up with" (aka Mumbling) I've noticed this with a few other shows also, but this is one of the worst. Had it not been for being able to turn on subtitles/captions, I would have given up by episode 3. Most of the supporting cast, I had no problems understanding/following. Otherwise, season 3 is pretty engaging with all the talented actors in the cast, several outstanding performances, the various plots and subplots. Season 1 is a masterpiece. The writing, directing and acting are among the very best I've ever seen on film or TV. It has everything going for it, from deep philosophical background to character development, cinematography, perfect tempo and the beauty of redemption. Fukunaga proved that he is a great director, while Woody Harrelson and Matthew McCounaghey simply played the roles of their lives so far. In short, True Detective's Season 1 could really be my favorite all-time series.<br/><br/>There are few things as dangerous as success and widespread acclaim. More often than not, whenever a work –be it a film, a series, a book, what have you– meets extraordinary success it tends to attract all sorts of people, ideas and interests that can easily ruin its further development.<br/><br/>It has happened in many TV series, and one of the best examples is True Detective.<br/><br/>After Season 1, the suits –whoever they are– came in. In their infinite middle-man wisdom, they decided that what made the series a success were the shallow, obvious, superficial aspects that are just a means to convey the message. They almost always do that, confusing substance with packaging. And they set off to create a "dark, gritty and slow" season 2. Of course, that is practically all they got. Season 2 has no heart, no spirit. You may want to steer clear from it.<br/><br/>A special mention goes to Vince Vaughn, though, who really gave it his all and managed to offer a very good performance.<br/><br/>Perhaps in Season 3 True Detective will find its way back to art, instead of sinking further into greed and superficiality. We'll see. This is wildly overrated. What seemed to start out with promise evaporated along the way and I thought the ending didn't do the setup justice. In fact, the bad guy and his environment weren't compelling or particularly interesting, and was only used to fill up time and resolve the plot, sort of, at the end. He didn't come across as monstrously depraved, as he should have. He came across as merely inbred and seedy. It would have been more interesting and intriguing to unpeel the bible school network and get under the oily skin of the proprietor family and their allusionary attraction to the 'dark side" (That's right – allusion not illusion). I appreciated Woody Harrelson's character's home life. Their realized dynamics came across as too painfully and uncomfortably real and were well written. Matthew McConaghey's character was not entirely believable, even within the Usual Suspects narrative setup. Rather than being swept away with plot developments and transcendent character development, the presentation devolved into annoying "look at me, I'm working hard at acting". Person Of Interest is a really corny show, but is a good example of an actor speaking in a funny voice. We also see it in shows like Hostages, CSI and, now, in True Detective.<br/><br/>Woody revives his "No Country" persona and Matthew goes for the worried nerd (like in Hannibal?).<br/><br/>SPOILER: The basic story is a fairly common pastiche of child abuse (in places of Hannibal's cannibalism), strange murder (antlers like Hannibal) and fraught relationships (like, yes you guessed it, Hannibal).<br/><br/>But my biggest gripe with this hotchpotch of story lines is that it promises more than it delivers. It is style over substance.<br/><br/>The ending is just a stupid shootout in the dark with the two "heroes" separating, with bad man popping out and being shot - JUST IN TIME - that we have seen in so many movies before. Add in that the heroes recover from 'fatal' injuries and the petty mumbling at the end is just that which is the philosophy of the town drunk.<br/><br/>Add in nudity and sex to boost the ratings and you have - this mediocre offering. I don't understand all the negative reviews for Season 2, unless they were written by wannabe philosophy majors who jerked off to all the pretentious lines from Season 1. Don't get me wrong, I liked Season 1, and there were some pretty good quotes, but some of them were just pointless. And I feel like the focus was not on the story itself, which made it a bit boring to watch, but nevertheless enjoyable.<br/><br/>Season 2, however, is a classic example of film noir, and some people obviously failed to understand that. I found the characters way more likable, the plot and the story itself were more interesting, and more fun to watch. The cast did a very good job, and I believe that Farrell, McAdams and Vaughn were just as good as McConaughey and Harrelson.<br/><br/>Don't believe all the negative reviews until you see it for yourself. And don't expect Season 2 to be the same as Season 1, as I believe many people did. I found the differences between Season 1 and 2 a good thing, because the directors obviously decided to enrich the show by changing styles and I, for one, am looking forward to Season 3 because I don't know what to expect and I like it that way. Loved the first, second was terrible, third I cannot stay awake. It's just a lot of hoarse mumbling in southern accents. The story just doesn't not progress. Several times I've had to start an episode again just to figure out what's going on. The pressure to make a season as good as the first is really getting to the writers and producers. All stars are for the first season. Season 1 was the best dark criminale in tv for years. It was like 7even and Crimson rivers. Dark. Intensive. Great acting and cops who gave their lives in fight with great evil. Season 3 is back in these tracks. With dark and sad atmosphere. Great acting again. 10/10. I didn't watch season 1 or 2. This season looked intriguing so I gave it a go. I was pleased that it delivered. I rarely get into shows and when I do I find most of them not great and I stop watching. I was riveted to this one. Yes Mahershala Ali mumbles to the point of distraction but don't watch it for him...the true star of this is Stephen Dorff. He is so amazing in this that it's gonna be a MAJOR disappointment to not see him recognized for his brilliant acting in this role. No doubt he will be overlooked because of Mahershala which is a shame. Yes MA is good in this but Stephen runs away with the show.<br/><br/>Stephen if you are reading this - you know how Hollywood works. I'd love to say that you will be a shoo-in for an award but I fear you will be overshadowed because of the current hype around MA. Just know that you were brilliant and you should be very proud of the work you did here. If I was in charge you'd get all the awards for this one hands down. I'm rooting for you buddy. Fingers crossed you get the recognition you deserve. Season 1 was incredible. Season 2, what the freak?<br/><br/>So far season 3 is living up to the reputation of season 1. Season 3: Comatose pace. Droning eerie music developing into nowhere. Cliche' characters and lines. Without apolgy this season is crammed with stereotypical, blase' tripe. By the time it "got" somewhere I had early onset alzheimers. I pity the brilliant actors who got suckered into this lead-filled stinker.<br/><br/>But, during the first two seasons you couldn't pull me away with a tractor beam. Slow and boring , drags on and on and on going nowhere ,nothing happens in majority of each episode , not in the same class as the others in this series I have to admit, I was one of the skeptics when i saw the Season 2 line up. I flat out don't (didn't) like Vince Vaughn, Farrel was your go to anti-hero guy, McAdams just didn't feel like having the "rough" in her for the dark in the series and Kitsch seemed the only one that could be molded into something fitting in. Pretty uninspiring to say the least.<br/><br/>First couple of episodes proved me dead wrong. Despite everyone being underwhelmed by the start (and i think the first seasons ending was so capturing everyone forgot how it started out), i just loved it. Interconnecting, many will say overwhelming plot lines that give you a hint of how they will unfold but still leave you unsure, flirting that thin line between a cliché and a potential for something more.<br/><br/>Vince was incredible, a mob guy with a soul played to perfection, possibly boosted by my low expectations. Farrel, having a pretty stereotype role made the most out of it. McAdams made me buy just how screwed up she was, tho i felt she was a bit our of her comfort zone. You can't find anything wrong about Kitsch's performance but it just isn't something you will remember, probably not his fault.<br/><br/>So, after this enormous introduction i will go straight to the point. I loved the story, the idea behind the story, the interconnecting plot lines that managed to seamlessly incorporate side stories that didn't feel pushed in. Although most of it unraveled with little surprise it still felt tense enough to expect a sharp plot twist at any moment. And then came the ending.<br/><br/>Going into the lats episode i wasn't really surprised. It pretty much went as i had expected but the most important thing is i didn't mind at all. That is how good i thought it was, a totally predictable last show and you still think it will come good. But, for the love of God... I can't speak for everyone but i for one am sick of Breaking Bad's and Game of Thrones. I don't want the entire cast, the characters i bonded with to just perish. Watching the last episode and enjoying the entire series i was sure this would break the norm. They were gonna pop the bubble and leave our hero/anti-hero/good-bad guy to live for a change. We were gonna leave with a satisfying feeling that our protagonists are making it and the bad guys are done. Something we very much enjoyed in the past but seemed to have died down in modern times. But no, lets just kill everyone you care about in the series because that's the hot thing in Hollywood now.<br/><br/>A bitter taste in the end to something that i felt was gonna break the stale norm we are having. For who knows what reason the mobster evil guy in the series is featuring Vince Vaughn. Vaughn is best known as a notable member of the Frat Pack. For crying out loud, he is supposed to make you laugh, NOT SCARED. We are so inculcated with him as a funny character, that his presence in the series really doesn't tie the play together. Not to mention Colin Farrell poor performance. The intro is cool though, Leonard Cohen's Never mind. You have a few flashes of David Lynch along the way.<br/><br/>Clearly the director wanted a cool show, but the ingredients are not quality, very much like a pizza. I hated season 2 and hoped season 3 would be good.. it isn't. Sloooooooow and boring. I give up I've read a lot of reviews about True Detective; the bad, the good and the in-between. I've come to the conclusion that a lot of thought has gone into this drama, analysing the complexities of the series and transferring those expectations to the story. I have a very simplistic view on this mesmerising show.<br/><br/>Sometimes, a room just needs a fresh coat of paint. That is what True Detective, for me, is all about. Taking a genre known so well by many and presenting it to the highest quality.<br/><br/>What this show has managed to do is take a conventional crime foundation, something done to death over the past 50 years, and given it a revamp. It's not blown open the crime genre, it's just re-invented it. It uses three main things; the characters, the dialogue and the atmosphere to create a series of the utmost quality. Is there anything special about that? Should a murder mystery be about more than just those things? Maybe. But True Detective does these three things with such style and substance that any deficiencies fade into the background.<br/><br/>To start with, the characters of Rust Cohle and Marty Hart are up there with the best in TV history, especially Cohle. It's not the fact that Hart is a revolutionary breakthrough in television, but it's the way he compliments his partner. Cohle is, by far, the most complex of the two and the series is all about, first and foremost, how these independent and contrasting personalities rub off against each other, become consumed by a haunting homicide case and then, ultimately, develop as a relationship. The script-writing and the atmosphere are both vital elements which allow these two to flourish. I've rarely seen a piece of television, either on the big or small screen, where you can take such negatively flawed people and want the best for them. This is what the show is about. The story within a story, and that first story is what makes this a stand-out piece of drama. Not what's told but how it's told.<br/><br/>That story-telling is where True Detective demonstrates it's brilliance. The constant chronological alterations, jumping between 17 years. The way certain parts are re-told, yet the scene is showing us something very different. It's genuine perfection. And the story-telling has so many layers. The further you get into the series, the deeper and darker the story gets, both the past and the present.<br/><br/>And, like any murder mystery, you need a destination. Right until the end of the seventh episode, we are left guessing as to who is responsible for the horrific crimes which haunt Louisiana. We are given a batch of hints and clues and it's up to us to take them or leave them as we feel necessary. We watch the lives of these two men fall apart and as the outer shell falls away we are left with the incredible similarities between the two within.<br/><br/>Some of the philosophical dialogue that Cohle indoctrinates us with is absolutely mind-bending. You sit there making sense of a lot of what he's saying and, like Marty, may seem to brush it off and consign it to the 'drivel' box. But, once you listen and think, you don't stop thinking. Both lead actors, Harrelson and McConaughey, are in top form throughout. It is certainly a career high from the latter. They are backed up by a memorable performance from Michelle Monaghan, who really adds great quality and depth to the show. They are the three main components behind the story and the character development, but the show certainly belongs to the two detectives.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend it to anybody and would say it will slot into your top 20 TV experiences of all time with some confidence, but you have to be prepared to let it grow and breathe. It is by far, in my opinion, the best show I have seen in the last 10 years and certainly the best of 2014. It's not a show that you can watch for an episode or two and make a judgement. You have to give it a good four or five hours and by then you'll be unable to pull out. If you expect gun showdowns and car chases, you aren't going to be happy. It's a slow-burning character study, done in such a way that you will want to watch each episode again and again. It's not an action thriller. It respects it's viewers and trusts us to take this journey.<br/><br/>And it is one beautifully haunting journey. One that you'll be glad you went on, even if you don't enjoy where it leads. Each succeeding season of this True Detective has degraded from the first one, this season being no different. The story became very labor intensive to the point of not being enjoyable to watch due to the jumping from past, not too distant past and present. I thought the acting was the only strong part of the series. Yet, the central mystery was of what happened to Julie was very plodding and could not have carried the audience in the conventional linear fashion of a mystery which is why, I believe it was written in this fashion. The last epsiode I thought was well done, in that it left it open to the viewer to determine whether Julie had been found. I had high expectations only because of the lead actor who I love. But this left me with so many unanswered questions. For instance...what happened to his wife? I need closure and the ending gave me nothing but confusion. This season just didn't do it for me. I wish it had. I love the characters. I love how the story is told in all three seasons. It makes you wanna think outside the box, and look at all directions. However it's like Nic gets lazy and just throws the ending together. So much potential but it falls flat on its face season after season...... I am a massive fan of season one. I was hooked on the script and the acting 10 out of 10... I was waiting excitedly for season 2 hoping for another great season and was soooo disappointed.. I couldn't even finish watching it.
So let's see how season 3 goes. Hope it's a good one! Not sure how to rate this because I loved 1 and hated 2? So I shall leave it blank until I hopefully watch all of season 3 Absolutely loved the first. It had everything. Perfect story, perfect characters, perfect actors, perfect dialogue, beautiful cinematography, great soundtrack etc. etc. etc.<br/><br/>The 2nd season failed at everything that made the first season great. It was unoriginal, boring, pretentious, filled with clichés, contained some awful dialogue and even worse acting. It desperately tried to package this mafioso soap opera into True Detective with a similar-sounding soundtrack and the same kind of look. There is nothing that suggests that this is the same television show aside from the name and the cheap rip off looks and sounds.<br/><br/>So, is the writer actually just bad? I mean it's the same guy! Was he found out? Maybe! Was the first season a fluke? In my eyes, it was a true work of art. Not just thrown together to milk the cow. It seemed like Nic Pizzolato took whatever time he needed for the show to become what it became. The second season feels like it was thrown together when the writer/producers realized that the first one was a hit.<br/><br/>You can see it on the actors. It went from A-list actors to bottom shelf A-list (maybe even B-list). From McConaughey and Harrelson to Colin Farrell and Vince Vaughn. You can clearly see that the first pair took the risk of going into television for a reason. Television has never been hot for successful actors. I'm not saying that TD were the first to do this, but they sure as hell kicked off the trend. So why did Matthew and Woody take a chance on this show? Cause it had one hell of a f*cking script, story and idea. Why did the second season attract lesser actors? Because why would any good actors be interested in such a poor script? Who were interested? Lesser actors who wanted to ride the wave. <br/><br/>What else can I say? I am so deeply disappointed even now, a year on and I'm dreading the fact that there is a third season on it's way. How dreadful is that going to be? Are they going for C-list actors this time around? Maybe Jensen Ackles and LL Cool J? Let's face it. It wasn't meant to be. There should've never been a second season. And there sure as hell shouldn't be a third.<br/><br/>I rate the first season a 9/10, the second one a 4/10. So I land on a 7. I would quite happily put the 8 episode True Detective series , starring Mathew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson, in the same league as The Sopranos, Deadwood, the first series of The Wire, (after series 1, for me, it lost its way), and possibly Breaking Bad, although I think True Detective tops BB by several percentage points.<br/><br/>It's quite possibly the best Cop series ever made and from start to finish I was totally absorbed in this 8-hour television drama.<br/><br/>This spellbinding production had everything going for it. A single writer and a single director, (every American TV series till now, no matter how good, always has a team of writers and directors), and two of the top actors of their generation. McConaughey has already picked up an Oscar for best actor, and in True Detective, he excels himself in the multi-layered role of the 'loner', brooding, cynical cop. Harrelson also probably plays his best ever role as McConaughey's loud-mouth sidekick, as they become embroiled in the 17-year hunt for a brutal serial killer. The supporting cast are also all top notch.<br/><br/>The directing, cinematography, are without fault, and episode 4 contains the most amazing six-minute action sequence, (all shot in one take), that I have ever seen on TV – or film. You can hardly take a breath until it is over. Set in Louisiana, the film's sombre, moody background provides the perfect backdrop for what turns out to be a thoroughly chilling murder story, investigated by two men, who in different ways, are both on their way to self-destruction.<br/><br/>In my view the ending is perfect, and I am really glad that the series creator has stated unequivocally that the characters will not return for a second series. That's just how it should be, as the only place they can go from here is down, and True Detective is quite possibly the finest piece of television drama ever made. (Review updated after Season 3).<br/><br/>A murder-mystery series with each season set in a different location, with different characters, and independent from the others.<br/><br/>Season 1 of True Detective was great. A slow-burning, incredibly intriguing crime-drama. Viewers were fed pieces of information regarding the crime, complete with a few red herrings and sudden bursts of action. All this was interspersed with the private lives and dramas of the two detectives (played superbly by Matthew McConoughey and Woody Harrelson). Plus, the finale was an incredible adrenaline rush of action. This all made for a highly intriguing, engaging and entertaining season.<br/><br/>In Season 2 creator Nic Pizzolatto tried the same thing: a slow-burn, with a rush of action towards the end. However, the first half of the season is too unfocused to be engaging. You have whole 50- minute episodes where you feel you really only got maybe 10 minutes of entertainment or information out of it. So many scenes with people staring blankly at each other for minutes on end...<br/><br/>I understand what he was trying to do: develop the characters, give us small pieces of information, build the background and intrigue. However, this time the story develops too slowly to maintain, or even develop, any engagement with the characters.<br/><br/>By the time you reach the climax of the season, you are so disengaged you hardly care who the characters are. e.g. Someone dies. You're pretty sure you're supposed to know the character and their relevance to the story but you were zoned out whenever their character was mentioned or had screen time. Thus, a piece of the puzzle dissolves.<br/><br/>All this leads to a massive dissipation of intrigue, and watching is just a chore - you're in this far, might as well see it through.<br/><br/>Add in some terrible miscasting and performances - Vince Vaughan should stick to B-grade comedies and Taylor Kitsch should stick to whatever he does best (this isn't it) - and a damp squib of a finale and Season 2 is very disappointing.<br/><br/>Season 3, released 3½ years after Season 2, initially looked very promising and had the potential to see a return to the form of Season 1. Puzzling mystery and a 3-time period storyline made for intriguing and engaging drama.<br/><br/>However, the mystery soon dissipated as the 3-time period formula gave away much of where the mystery was heading. Rather than being a murder mystery it became a human/relationship drama, and not a very interesting one. Nic Pizzolatto did his best to recreate the dark, brooding atmosphere that permeated Season 1 but it can't hide the lack of genuine intrigue or of character engagement. Good ending though.<br/><br/>Season ratings: S1 - 9/10, S2 - 5/10, S3 - 6/10. Quite simply, magnificent. HBO's latest phenomenon, True Detective, is the best new TV show around. The setting is used to every advantage in the cinematography and contributes to the feeling of dread the show evokes. The acting by Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson is off the charts. I really loved this show, perfect in every department Cast is great , story is awesome. The climax was really great during the whole show. Even the 90s are well depicted and justified. Importantly the twists in the plot are very unpredictable. Can't wait to see if season 2 can live up to the expectations the first season has left on everyone. I wish I could give this show a lower score.<br/><br/>Officially placing this TV series as the worst TV series I have ever seen, I would rather watch 'Cop Rock' 10 times than watch just one more episode of this.<br/><br/>Looking over the message boards, I was amazed to see the positive reviews and comments this show was getting, and the rating? It's beyond me.<br/><br/>The illusion that this show has an intelligent narrative is comical, I know 8 year olds that could grasp the narrative with ease, the same weak argument is always placed over and over 'It's just too intelligent for you, go watch an action series'. <br/><br/>I don't want to make this too long as I have better things to do than waste anymore time of my life on this drivel, but the characters are awful and pathetic in this series.<br/><br/>We have Martin, the unfaithful husband that still acts like a child. Rust, the 'wanna-be' edgy hypocrite. Martin's wife Maggie, the 'victim' who's just as bad as Martin.<br/><br/>At first the narrative did grasp me, but it was executed in all the wrong ways, this show spends more time focusing on the appalling character development than it does progressing the story. <br/><br/>On a final note, I saw the nudity as just an attempt to grasp as much audience as they could salvage and is probably where most of these votes have come from. I recall one scene when it just suddenly cuts to show a naked pole dancer for the 3rd time in the scene, I think the 'intelligent' spectator should already know the setting after the first time you showed us, absolutely pathetic.<br/><br/>If I could give you any word of advice, stay clear of this series and don't ever look back, I sure wish I did. I want to give this a 7 for the two actors' performance, but 7 on is stuff I would say "I enjoyed it overall". I didn't. I force myself to sit through it in full dread to know what happens at the end. So nah, 6.<br/><br/>I like both male leads as actors, I like the fact that the two are having fun having it their way in screen-time monopoly and maximum dialog output, I just don't like contrivance. It's not even the slow-pace start - I love Breaking Bad's refreshing long scenes pacing, I like getting deeper with the players and the world in long arc series, like The Killing, rather than the hurried semi-procedural sort. True Detective is indeed long-arc and non-procedural, which is cool by me...<br/><br/>That said, there's no edge-of-seat anticipatory mood for me until around the 6th episode, when it stops contriving "WOW look how these two great screen actors dare to transform themselves physically from hot 30-something to almost 50!!" and starts to excite with real meaningful story movement.<br/><br/>By 2nd episode, it is clear to me, this show's formula = Bleak + Gore + Banal Atmosphere + 2 movie stars competing to out-anti-hero the other. It's like over a few beers a few big Hollywood shots thought, DULLNESS is SO IN nowadays! Let's take all the BLEAKEST and UGLIEST bits of Dexter, CSI, Breaking Bad and add some retro-costume + anti-hero cop buddy sauce on top. <br/><br/>Fine and well...some people actually enjoy very dry and over-filtered beers advertized by branded faces. Unfortunately...one crucial ingredient is missing = black humor. True Detective is SO earnestly dull and doggedly cynical and calculatedly immoral it soon became draggy like Walking Dead by 3rd episode.<br/><br/>Really, dull ain't sexy. At their bleakest, even super-dry shows like The Killing still has tender SOULFUL relief moments.<br/><br/>The show is not all boredom. The actors - even the transients, were high quality. There were tensions and suspense to keep me going in spite of the dread and semi-apathy. But overall the grittiness feels forced, from soundtrack to intro to filler shots. The occasional bleakness breaks to equally-tense domestic scenes don't count as breaks, neither are the crudely-done female nudity scenes. Sleaze should not be the only good thing worthy as relief from the supposedly all-prevailing soullessness of 90's working class Louisiana.<br/><br/>It doesn't help that women in this show only serve as the good women (wife/mother/nurse/innocent virginal victim) or the bad women (husband thieves/sex-workers). The black cops were one-dimensionally painted too. All backdrop fillers to contrast the mono-tonal oh-so-bad boys with a heart. I was hoping they would introduce more complex female characters eventually, but nothing of that sort. Just two star-quality male leads busy painting how cynical and amoral and self-loathing they both are.<br/><br/>I wish this story about missing children can be explored with more focus on the children and the repressive cultural climate, and less focus on the sleaze aspect or soulless visuals of the milieu. <br/><br/>Is it worth watching? I watched it to the end, yet felt glad it is finally over. If you enjoy watching McConaughey and Harrelson pulling their stunts as good actors, if you can live with the most gratuitous psychological and visual violence from Dexter all at once, yes. If you hate the "sentimentalized gore" of Walking Dead or Dexter's OTT satanic crime scenes, you need to reduce your expectation and definitely brace yourself if you must watch this. Thought series two was full of padding, marking time but this series does the same on 3 time zones, a soap opera plot revolving around the detectives that was tired and worn. Wonder if the main actor was trained in How to act like a scaffold plank. After 4 episodes decided to cut to the last one and realized I wasn't interested in who done it or much else.
Wonder if its been all hype with no substance since the first series. I believe that they should have given the leading role to steven dorff he's amazing in the show.Alis performance in my opinion is really overrated and overacted.His character and his wife are completely uninteresting and their conversations are really long and boring.Also the childrens murder mystery so far isnt as intriguing as whe have hoped for after waiting 4 years.A return to form for true detective season 3 but keep your expectations low and don't compare it to the excellent first season. I have seen just about every series existing series and I am a huge fan of the great "Breaking Bad". Long was I certain, that no other series ever will reach to that level of BB. Then I saw "True Detectives" - watching it now for the 5th time. <br/><br/>The "psycho sphere" is pure and deep art, the dialogues are amazing, the nihilistic-mystical influences awesome - it has influenced me in my art very strongly. True Detectives is a psycho- spheral trip of introspection and confrontation with our "shadows" (C. G. Jung) and it seems to be influence by Kafka and other great masters of the surreal and bizarre. <br/><br/>What a grandiose masterpiece of art!!!!! This is one of the best shows I've ever seen. no question about it. The acting, by both lead actors Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson is flawless, awe-inspiring - I really can't complement these actors enough. Actually, I heard McConaughey's speech at the Oscars before watching this show, and I thought to myself that it was one of the most narcissistic and pathetic speeches I've ever heard, and it made me really lose respect for McConaughey as a person. But seeing him in action, bringing to life Cohle's very complex and deep character, really changed my mind. I mean, this is by no means an easy role to play, and he does it brilliantly.<br/><br/>The plot is excellent. Everything is minimal, nothing over-played, nothing over-dramatic, everything very very precise. Usually I don't have the patience when things go a little slow (I was very bored with Breaking Bad, for example), but in True Detective, even though things have a pace of their own, you remain in suspense almost every second of it. It's like you can really savor the slowness of it.<br/><br/>In short, this show is very highly recommended. I cannot for the life of me understand any of these good ratings. If I could sue for false advertising i would! Slow and boring and not even a good ending. Ending was true to the rest of the show... boring and uninteresting. It's like watching the complete 4 game series of a May match-up between the White-Sox and Reds played at noon. Only watched it because of the hope they couldn't do worse than Season 2 but they did. I would actually say it was better but that's only like saying you spent your whole vacation in the Cayman's... in your room watching WKRP in Cincinnati instead of doing the same but watching CSPAN the whole time. Sorry but this show sucks. Changing rating from a 3 to a 1. To follow third season of True Detective was as thrilling as a piece of dry bread. My girlfriend and I kept saying "Something is bound to happen". Even in the end, when he's sitting in the bar. But yet another out og context relationship-scene pops up. Suddenly they just find the Black dude and he spills his guts with the lamest crime story. And the Girl is Living peacefully showing no Signs of trauma? What is This trash. This could be an okay series, but don't Call it True Detective. Call it True Drama.
My girlfriend and I agreed that we have to have missed something - it couldn't suck that bad. I still hope that's the case, but I'm not giving another shot.<br/><br/>Went from 10/10 to 7/10. SEASon 1 is still the Best piece of tv of all time.<br/><br/>SEASon 3 2/10 (Only good thing is acting og two Detectives) Season 1 was pure genius. Acting, story, and direction was excellent.
Season 2 however, was just an absolute mess. After suffering through 4 episodes I called it quits.
Season 3 so far is just as good as season 1. Can't wait for the rest to air. This is by far the greatest detective show of all time. The acting is incredible and the Harrelson and McConaughey's characters are likable and believable. This is some of their best acting ever. The plot is incredibly intriguing with the contrast between the satanic murderer and McConaughey's atheistic beliefs. Harrelson is a below average intelligence detective with a squeaky clean life. McConaughey is a highly intelligent detective with a checkered past. There is friction between the two men because of their contrasting beliefs. But this friction adds to the already enticing plot. And the fact that the partnership between the two could implode at any moment, only makes the work they do together that much more valuable. I applaud McConaughey and Harrelson for doing this show. Without their acting, this show would be great, but because of them, this show is the all time greatest. On its surface, "True Detective" is a cop show with a hackneyed premise: a mismatched pair of detectives go hunting for a serial killer, persisting on the case despite various obstacles placed in their way and ultimately going it alone to solve it. However, "True Detective" transcends this premise in so many directions that the show ultimately resembles nothing that's suggested by it.<br/><br/>For a start, detective fiction is perhaps the most heavily plot-driven genre of all: the pleasure for aficionados is routinely in matching wits with the fictional detective and trying to piece together the clues that solve the crime. In "True Detective", the focus is very much on the characters, setting, and mood instead; it's possible to enjoy these aspects of the show without caring too much about the story at all. Indeed, when a major breakthrough in the case rests on a single extraordinary co-incidence, I wonder how satisfying the story really is for dedicated fans of detective fiction.<br/><br/>The central characters of this drama are extremely well-rounded, even if some of the others are generic stereotypes. I particularly enjoyed the character of Detective Rust Cohle, one half of the central "odd couple": a deep-thinking nihilist given to long, philosophising speeches and giving air to uncomfortable truths. This character works all the better through his contrast with his down-to-earth partner Marty Hart, who is by turns baffled and repulsed by Cohle.<br/><br/>The setting -- the decrepit backwaters of Louisiana -- is so powerful that it's almost a character itself. Decay is all-pervasive: from industrial blight to burnt-out churches to the tawdriness of a low-rent tent revival and a hillbilly brothel made of caravans. All of this is shot magnificently and cinematically. When Cohle comments on a couple of occasions that he can "taste the ash" just by observing this landscape, I could see what he means.<br/><br/>For me, the greatest joy in the show was its treatment of its supernatural elements. The series of murders that drive the plot are unquestionably ritualistic, and the plot references elements of the broader Lovecraftian or Cthulhu mythos. Fans of that material (including me) will read the antagonists in "True Detective" as cultists succeeding in opening connections to an alien god. People not familiar with that material will just read it as "Satanists" deluding themselves. The skill in "True Detective" is in its ambiguity and subtlety -- exactly as the Mythos should work, in my opinion. The supernatural is here for those who know what to look for; yet everything remains within the realms of plausible deniability and can be rationalised away. For example, the most overt supernatural event in the show is seen through the eyes of a character known to experience hallucinations. Absolutely perfect.<br/><br/>If I have any criticism of this series at all, it's that I thought the ending was far too upbeat. Both Rust and Marty live through the serious injuries they sustain when they confront a powerful cultist in his lair. I think the tone of the rest of the story would have been better sustained had they died there, or if either had survived that they would have been driven to insanity by what they had seen and experienced. A grim tale deserves a grimmer ending.<br/><br/>I suspect that fans of detective fiction might enjoy this but not find anything noteworthy on those terms. Fans of the Mythos should enjoy this for the tour-de-force that it is. And for everybody else, if strong characterisation, dark and moody cinematography, and outstanding performances are your thing irrespective of genre, there's lots to like here too. S3 is obviously trying to kill two birds with one stone. This season seems more about race interactions back in the day than really making a Crime/Drama. Even though we're now in 2019 this topic is more heated than ever. The fact that I'm even talking about race means the writer got his two bits in. As far as the narrative and work on the crime/mystery, it's now non existant. The writer neglected one for the other, and as a result completely ruined this series. I will try to summarize the show and help you to choose whether is worthy or not to watch it. If you like action, don't watch it. If you like Hollywood movies, don't watch it. If you like European movies, watch it. If you like Almodovar movies, watch it. If you like to stay in front of the TV and wait to nothing really happens during almost an hour, watch it. If you don't have a thing to do, don't watch it, get some sleep If you think 9.3 it's a great grade, watch it and never trust IMDb again. I got to disappointed with this show, specially after reading the reviews, i try hard, but it's awful, you may try, just to know what it looks like. Like most people, I bought into the HBO hype and looked forward to the airing of this show. After one episode, I was telling myself to be patient and it might get better. After the next episode, my wife and I both lost interest. The screenplay was all based on flashbacks, jumped around with muttered dialog that was hard to follow. Evidently the producer/director were aware of this problem. So after each show they spent a few minutes to "explain" to the audience what just happened, what the characters were thinking, etc..<br/><br/>We still watch episode 3 on OnDemand, reconfirmed that it didn't get better. Then we stopped. Our daughter later told us that it got better in later episodes, so we went through the remaining 5 hours in one day. Although it got better, it's still not good. By comparison, we had just watched FX's new series Fargo, and the difference is night and day.<br/><br/>It's common for HBO series to have 10 episodes in a season. That this slow and wandering series ended in 8 goes to show that there is simply not that much in the plot. The writers were just stretching things out as much as they could. The way they keep the suspense is to have disconnected scenes and dialogs that leave the audience in a fog，The two lead characters, portrayed as flawed heroes do not generate much interest or sympathy. Other characters added little or nothing. I can't help but to think that they're just used to kill time and add some gratuitous sex scenes.<br/><br/>In one episode, I actually watched the after-show explanation. It was explained that all the time when Cohle was interviewed and giving flashbacks, he was drinking beer because he was smart enough to know that everything he said would be inadmissible in court. This is just one example of how the writer/director didn't know how to tell a story, and there wasn't that much in the story to begin with. Five episodes in, HBO's True Detective is a mesmerizing glimpse into two disparate but equally haunted detectives so busy fighting their own personal demons it's no small wonder they have time to track down a serial killer. <br/><br/>MM & WH head an outstanding cast in this very dark and brooding series that runs on three separate tracks, a 17 year old case the detectives 'solved' together, their eventual breakup as partners 10 years later,and an apparently new case involving a murder (or murders) with the same MO as the one they worked on and 'solved' together long ago. <br/><br/>As with the outstanding BBC series Luther,this is a cerebral drama in which it's often hard to tell the difference between the good guys and the bad guys. Action junkies stay away, but anyone fond of taking your dark side out for a walk now and again will absolutely love this series. Do not waste your time, season 1 was good, season 2 was Ok, season 3, NO, NO, NO !!!!!!!!! The amazing make-up job that might cost a lot, wasted a lot of time for the makeup artists to transform these two leading actors from the middle aged detectives to two old farts, and one of them with Alzheimer's disease. The whole Season 3 is just like Season 2, a total waste of HBO's time and money to produce such bad-worse-worst TV drama series in TV production history. Jesus, it's just so shamefully bad. HBO only did one thing good to okay these two seasons even they were so dominantly cursed with negative reviews: These two series helped a lot of people who used to take sleeping pills to help them sleep, but if sitting in front of the TV to watch these series, they'd fall asleep very soon without any difficulty to close their eyes and start snoring. HBO just couldn't stop the decline and fall like the Roman Empire, and will soon become a relic cable production company. What a shame. This must be one of the worst shows I have ever seen. Perhaps I didn't watch it intensively enough, but I didn't get any of the plot. What was it all about? All that fuss, just to find one hillbilly murder? And: whats the lesson? Police get away with murder? Why are people so exited about it? I don't get it. The story is so idiotically, for instance: Woody enters a bar and a beautiful young girl gets horny and goes to bed with him? Can't remember that ever happening to me but I am no Mr. Harrison. Stupid. Then all that smoking, poor McCournacky (sorry for the misspelling). He must have contracted lung cancer after that show... Really enjoyed Season One; two antiheroes behaving like True Detectives. Excellent acting, excellent production work.<br/><br/>Season Two was entertaining, imo. I think back often to several of the most interesting scenes. It was arty and most of the time, it worked.<br/><br/>Season Three's story was a bit less strong. The main problems I had with it were that it moved too slowly, felt the disjointed flashbacks subtracted from the overall product, and that it was left to a writer to solve the case, not the detectives. But what made Season Three most frustrating for me was that (a) Big Tobacco had managed to insert unnecessary smoking scenes hundreds of times, and (b) Mahersjala Ali decided to play his character as a mumbler. Even with rewind/replay, I didn't catch many of his lines. Presumably the writers had written those lines for a reason. We shouldn't need to rewind too often per episode. Pizzolatto has created a bravura anthology psychological crime drama. Pizzolatto and Milch pen the series. Milch is the creator and one of the writers on, "Deadwood". All three seasons are psychological mind benders. Season 1 is ingenious as it follows Dt. Rust Cohle and Dt. Marty Hart through a past and present narrative. McConaughey and Harrelson are absolutely mesmerizing. Set in Louisiana the detectives are revisiting a case from 17 years earlier in 1995 that involved the murder of a prostitute. Season 2 is set in California and follows Dt. Ray Velcoro and Dt. Ani Bezzerides. Farrell and McAdams are superlative. This time the detectives are trying to solve the murder of a corrupt city manager which actually prompts three different investigations one of which is launched by a career criminal who is trying to go legit, but has been burned in a business deal involving the city manager. Season 3 has returned the series to glory. Ali and Dorff are outstanding. This mystery takes place in Missouri and includes Dt. Wayne Hayes and Dt. Roland West. The investigation of the disappearance of two children takes place over three time periods, the last of which is when the detectives are retired and are being investigated themselves. All of the stellar supporting cast deliver top notch performances in all three seasons. In all three seasons the detective partnerships compliment, question and validify each other perfectly. This series has excellent direction, writing, settings, costume, cinematography, acting, score and mind blowing plots. Each season has kept me on the edge of my seat and guessing until the very end. The show takes this viewer or at least tries to take this viewer as much as possible, inside the mind of the detectives and suspects. It's a unique series in that respect alone. The plots are duplicitous, thrilling, intelligent, violent, clever, addictive, insightful, captivating and have cathartic endings. I look forward to many more seasons, if the show continues to exceed all others in it's genre. So far Pizzolatto has created a sublime series and one of the very best in it's genre. This series is truly unparalleled artwork in this viewer's opinion. Love everything about this crime/mystery show except Season 2 was a disaster in many ways! Seasons 1 & 3 were extremely well done. Best writing; many geniuses involved glad they learned their lesson with Season 2 by improving Season 3 up so many notches -- sorry I'm a little quirky! How does a show drop off so drastically from the first season to the second? First season was great, I thought, "WOW this is a great series. Finally, something worth watching." The second season left me wondering what happened. The sound and dialogue are awful. Mumbling, no chemistry. It's like they have to try to explain what is happening in every scene because they can't write well enough for the viewer to follow along. It's just really bad. Well, what can I say? This show (first season, because each season is different) is just amazingly directed. It is very dark and the atmosphere of the Louisiana landscapes contributes to it. The plot is super intriguing and the actors are just top class acting. Here's a little synopsis : After the murder of a young prostitute, Lousiana cops (Rust and Marty) are leading the investigation. And what they discover is way more than just a simple murder.<br/><br/>It will make you uncomfortable, stressed and shocked. And the actors are so good that you can't just watch one episode at a time.<br/><br/>So if you haven't guessed it already, you should definitely watch the show, you won't regret it. Wow! What an amazing show! True Detective is unlike any other show I've seen before, with twists and turns at every corner, the show will have you hooked from the very first episode, all the way to the finale. Matthew Mcconaughey and Woody Harrelson headline a tremendous cast that will have you so involved in the story, that you actually feel like a part of it. The show switches between 1995/2002 and 2012 making it a fascinating story to hear which also features detailed character personalities.<br/><br/>The show follows the unique and intriguing story of two detectives Rustin Cohle(Matthew Mcconaughey)and Marty Hart(Woody Harrelson)as they investigate the mysterious ritual related deaths of multiple women and children. The great acting and broad and complex story make it one of the best TV shows of its genre and I highly recommend everyone to watch this thrilling show! There's some very good acting, shooting and editing, and design. Add these together, and it is at times great filmmaking. It has great opening credits and song. It's absolutely a home run of PR and marketing. All in the service of what?<br/><br/>The showrunner and director, on record in various publications, have a cute little excuse for every criticism of the show. If you say it's sexist, they say "it's about sexism". If you say it's cliché, they say "it's about clichés". If you criticize it as lowbrow slop on a fancy plate, they say you don't get what they're cookin'. They're full of crap. (If you say that they set up a bunch of red herrings that they failed to use interestingly, even as red herrings... they say "what red herrings?")<br/><br/>The show promises very well in its first episode or two and then entirely fails to deliver. It slowly gets stupider and more cliché with each episode. It has some of the worst writing I've heard on a critically acclaimed show. The writing is sometimes bad in the ham-fisted dialog and characterization, often pretentious (failed attempts at intellect) in key speeches that were meant to be profound, and adds up to less than zero across the eight episodes. The story logic of how the main two characters consider the ending is totally broken. The show has nothing new, interesting or subtle to say, feel or think, try or play around with, and fails at all of that amid notably great acting, shooting, editing and design. Due to the nature of this show, it's a hard one to review.<br/><br/>It isn't really season 2 of True Detective at all - it's a new show from some of the same people.<br/><br/>The first season got all the lauding it deserved - it was, some incoherent dialogue aside, stunning. It was complex, but layered, and while some of its elements got lost in the myriad of story, it held itself together with incredible acting, stellar direction and great writing.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, season 2 is just a disaster and failed miserably to live up to the first - new story, new characters, new pretty much everything. I mean we knew this would be the case, but it shows how good the first season was that this one feels so astoundingly poor in comparison.<br/><br/>From Major Chessani's comical loud water swallowing, to the muddy plotting where various different themes are thrown incomprehensibly at you, to the cast's struggles to be believable (Farrell is the best, and he ain't great), this is just a great big mess which is trying desperately to be as good as the first season but comes up short dramatically.<br/><br/>I'd sum this season up by thus: Someone says something, it's barely audible. They say it fast. The response from someone else doesn't even seem to be especially related and again, it's barely audible. This goes on till the end of the scene.<br/><br/>The viewer is left completely bewildered by what is actually meant to be going on.<br/><br/>They've put together layers but instead of blending they put them side by side and hope the viewer can make sense of it.<br/><br/>We can't. Because there's nothing beneath the hood to make sense of anyway. Watched the entire series - all eight episodes - and at the end of episode eight I felt cheated and deceived.<br/><br/>Each episode of the series offered something to keep you coming back to watch more. Unfortunately by the third episode I was getting bored but they 'smartly' tossed into the mix personality elements of Hart and Cohle. At this point the viewer wonders how will the personalities of the two detectives affect the murder investigation. Booze, cigarettes, & sex!<br/><br/>Symbolism, philosophy, and spirituality play a prominent roll throughout the story --- but it's ultimately the plot line, the mystery of the murders that bring you back to watch the next episode.<br/><br/>Then episode eight - the final episode - and I'm looking for closure to this 17 year story and all we get is more symbolism. Example - that labyrinth of tunnels in which Cohle must seek the ever present voice and then the darkness! Here are our two lead players surviving wounds that would kill the strongest of persons and a flare illuminates their death chamber through an oculus in the dark dome above them.<br/><br/>In the final scene Hart & Cohle express their near death feelings to each other (the first time there is a true emotional conversation between them) the usually stoic Cohle admits his feeling the 'oneness with the dark and his deceased daughter' and Hart reminds him of the stories Cohle would make up while watching the stars in the night when living in Alaska. The message here is that there is no 'oneness with the universe' as Cohle always said. He deluded himself with another story.<br/><br/>Then Hart & Cohle walk off. A perfect setup for season two! As a separate series, Season 2 is a good series. Having to follow the masterpiece which was Season 1, Season 2 is beyond a reasonable doubt the lesser of the two seasons. Here are the five reasons why. 1. The Cast. Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson both gave brilliant performances. They alone carried the series without having to rely on a good story. With Season 2, Colin Farrell and Vince Vaughn fall short in comparison. Sadly, Colin Farrell gives one of the better performances in his career, but still can't compete in the same category as McConaughey and Harrelson. Vince Vaughn has typed cast himself too many times in goof ball comedies to be easily accepted in any dramatic role. Rachel McAdams is a good supporting actress but can not lead the cast in order to make it a success. Unlike Michelle Monaghan, McAdams brings secy back, but is an empty character even with all the back story the series tries to give to the audience. 2. The Location. The Louisiana backdrop is more exciting, more real and more intriguing that La La land. California may enjoy the backdrop of LA as a unique setting, but not for the rest of the country. The attempt to make the city a character as much as they made Louisiana fell short half way through the first episode. 3. The Music. Although good, the soundtrack of season 2 is a far cry from season 1. The opening credits was something that audiences had never seen or heard before. Season 2 was a recycle creation from the first and not as good. The soundtrack is also a reflection of the show's characters and setting as it speaks for itself. 4. Flash backs and Time period. Season 1 showcased the story line in the mid to late 90's and the present day. With the wardrobe, props and hair styles, it was a fantastic depiction of the two decades. Season 2 has minimal flash backs and has none of the impact that Season 1 gives. 5. The Crime. Audiences were hooked after the first scene in Season 1. The stage had been set as the Viewer was on board with the investigation and the mystery that surrounded it. Season 2 lacked this. In fact, it took a few episodes to entrench it's audience to stick around for all eight episodes. Overall, both seasons has its merit. Then again, Season 2 is a different show entirely when comparing it to Season 1. This season sucks ass, Very slow cinematography. The best thing about season 1 was the director Cary Fukunaga. The One shot Project scene was TV shattering awesome. But now the writer thinks he was responsible for the greatness of season 1 we really see who really made season 1 great. Nic Pizzolatto you suck monkey ass. Stick with writing your garbage show runner and you have a little man syndrome. You are running this show down to ground. The only good thing about season 2 is the Actors, Colin Farrell your a comeback king, stick with the TV shows cause your in control. Love your acting skills you make me believe your a deadbeat depressed ass cop. And love the stash that makes you unstoppable. I'm surprised by reviews that said season3 was boring because I found it unique and interesting. It brings to light the struggles of dementia. Beautiful acting by all characters, even Steven Dorff performance blew me away. The story tied up nicely. Loved the first season. 10/10
Second season just watchable 3/10
Third season just terrible 0/10<br/><br/>If you want something that holds your interest and is also entertaining, skip season 3 entirely. Don't even waste your time watching beyond the first episode. The first episode got me interested but the rest of season 3 = Dark, moody, mumbling, and stagnant, and utterly boring.
Watch season #1, enjoy, and move along. Watching a fly take a nap might be as entertaining. HBO, what went wrong?! If you really want to adore this, stop watching True Detective after 1st season, if you want to say "Man, this is not that bad", be free to watch 2nd season as well, but if you want to say "What is wrong with this, I am sleepy, bored, unsatisfied" then watch all 3 seasons, I really don't understand people talking about some magnificence, majesty, "mind-blowing" stories, I just wonder HOW are people talking like that? So slow, dull, empty, to much retrospective, just to make it "more complicated" to make it more "thrillerish". Its time to STOP, just get back to the drawing board. This is far from the best thing since sliced bread, this is just an average set of stories with good actors and big hype because of that fact. The review is in the title. Great disappointment series 3. I lost interest from near the beginning. Season 1<br/><br/>"True detective" is primarily the creation of two talented people: the director - Carey Fukunaga and the screenwriter, and by part-time and show-runner of the project - Nick Pizzolatto. And the fact that there was no team of 20 screenwriters, and a crowd of directors, shooting in one series, went to the show only for the benefit.<br/><br/>The second advantage of the series was the scene - Louisiana. A very colorful place, in which, in the course of the series, horrible events occur. And the detective intrigue here does not play a major role. This is not a clever detective story, in which, together with the protagonist, we unravel the mystery of some crime.<br/><br/>This work takes its crazy atmosphere, a mixture of neon and southern Gothic with many references to the works of Lovecraft and occult rituals, which gives the series a pinch of mysticism. This is one of many advantages of the artistic component of the series, now you can talk about technical performance.<br/><br/>The series is shot at 35 millimeters and this is very beautiful. Film crew professionals and coped with their task perfectly. For an episode in the ghetto, shot by one double, I applaud standing.<br/><br/>Summing up, I will say that the series is worth watching for everyone who loves a quality TV product with the eerie atmosphere of the American south. Season 3:
Do you ever get the impression you've watched something that was completely different to what everyone else watched? Season 3 has been rated very highly. Well I just can't figure out exactly how. It's awful! The jumping between three time-lines is bad enough (and largely unnecessary), but it's the final episode which really takes the biscuit. It's incredibly lame. The final 'reveal' is such an incredible anti-climax, and lacking in belief and sense. We found ourselves looking at each other and saying 'Eh?'. It's not just bad, it's very bad. So much could have been done with the story, and your mind will come up with a better ending than the real one by episode 5. I also very much disliked the main character's constant mumbling. We missed lots of full sentences, not just words. There's no excuse for that - directors really have to get a grip with this mumbling stuff. Season 3 has let down the entire True Detective run. Frankly, it should never have been made. I found the third season of True Detective to be the most humane and warm of all the seasons.<br/><br/>It speaks about the power of friendship and forgiveness. It dwells on the guilt of having to leave your past behind, literally erased in order to free up memory space for what is coming. It offers a solution to crime not about good or evil but circumstances. All the characters in this season are well rounded multidimensional. The investigation of the disapearence of two children in a small town plays out precisely like most investigations play out in real life.<br/><br/>For those expecting explosions and big dark twisted finales, sprinkled with deep metaphors about life...this is both precisely for you and not. It really depends how willing you are to connect with the characters and the themes of the series.<br/><br/>Season 3, My favorite season son far. I was a huge fan of True Detective last season and I was really looking forward to the next year with new characters. Being a huge fan of Colin, Rachel and Vince; I thought it would be better this time around; I was wrong. I am not really sure why I am so disappointed with this year's attempt. Part of the reason is the characters are so boring I just no longer care what happens next. It just seems everyone is miscast in roles no one wants to see them in and the stories are so convoluted and spread so thin, one cannot muster any real enthusiasm to follow their journeys. Not to mention all of the threads of each story are so dark, so completely depressing and just flat out mundane, any remaining audience base at this point has absolutely no interest in continuing to even want to try to revive any Type of audience relationship cultivated with any of the characters. Not one of the characters is even likable and I am not sure if it because they are written that way, or because the parts are so miscast the actors playing these parts are too unbelievable to buy into their characters. I love Rachael McAdams, but her playing Ani, just does not compute at all. Last season all the characters were united in tells the h one story in two separate eras. Unfortunately, this season seems to drift all over the place with 2 dimensional characters that No matter how hard I try, I just cannot seem to care about. Very disappointing! Question: did Mathew and Woody have a much better script or was their acting so off the charts that the magic just cannot be repeated? I really wanted to love this, as I am a long standing fan of Woody Harrelson and a newer fan of Matthew McConaughey.<br/><br/>However, the first 10 minutes lets you know - women are raped and murdered, and of course they show you the visuals because our public likes it so much. Why do we not see visuals of naked, tortured children on television? Because nobody likes that! We see it with women all the time and it's just unoriginal. Victimized woman, hero man. This is the most old, worn out plot there is. Where is the reality there? Where is the complexity of human emotions and actions and roles? <br/><br/>As much as I love Woody, I found his acting strained. Very little facial change whether he is talking to a sexual interest, his male partner, his daughters, etc. Matthew's acting was beautiful and showed complexity.<br/><br/>Then, there are magically no women in their professional industry past and present - except the de-sexualized black woman who just makes the men coffee and she is actually explicitly called the oh-so-common, and not helpful stereotype of "strong and black." The wife is introduced to the audience with a visual of her butt in panties and of course no man is introduced that way. Here is a sum of the women characters: victims, hookers, nagging wife, young mistress, useless poor, fat women to be questioned, and the de-sexualized black secretary. Women account for 50% of our population and that is all they could come up with? Again, so unoriginal. ... Is there ANYTHING that Mahershala Ali cannot do? In "Moonlight" he is a drug dealer with a heart that takes a bullied young boy under his wing, disappears about 30 minutes in, and I miss him for the rest of the film. In "Green Book" he gives a nuanced performance as a pianist during the civil rights era, and here he is a Vietnam vet born before the civil rights era, but it is now 1980 and he is a detective with the Arkansas state police at probably the earliest point in American history where that could happen.<br/><br/>In 1980 detective Wayne Hays is about 35, 12 years with the state police, when a boy and girl - the Purcell children - go missing shortly after Halloween in a poor white rural Arkansas town. Ten years before he would have been the suspect, but here he is assisting local police. On the surface, the witnesses are cooperative - "yes sir", "no sir". But push just a little too hard or too far for their tastes and That Word That Shall Not be Named comes rolling trippingly off of their tongues.<br/><br/>The same with African American Amelia Reardon. Also born before the Civil Rights era, she is now probably late 20s, went to college, went to San Francisco and was part of the hippie movement, but ultimately came home to teach poor white kids in public school at probably the earliest point in time that this could happen. She was missing girl Julie Purcell's teacher, and Wayne meets her as part of the investigation.<br/><br/>Sadly, the boy is found dead soon after the two kids go missing. But the trail goes cold on Julie Purcell. However, new leads spring up in 1990, and interest in the case in Wayne's part in it resurfaces in 2015, and a now 70 year old Wayne, facing the beginnings of dementia, wants to ultimately solve this case. Ali is particularly poignant as elderly Wayne - he disappears into the part.<br/><br/>Why did I add a spoiler warning to this? Two qualms I have with this. One is with Amelia's and Wayne's romance. Wayne makes a decision to protect Amelia and it costs him not his job, but his position as detective. Amelia comes to his house to confront him about his suddenly vacating their relationship. Wayne dumps her possessions in a box, hands them to her, and then proceeds to dump all of his frustrations on her. I can't say they are entirely undeserved. At the end she comes to him at the VFW bar and says "You know, I don't just let anybody talk to me the way you did"...AND YET HERE YOU ARE!!! I just don't believe such a proud woman would do that nor do I believe Wayne's ultimate reaction.<br/><br/>My final and very spoilerish remark. I mean it! If that woman at the end is supposed to be 45 year old Julie Purcell, then I served lemonade to the signers of the Declaration of Independence. She looks early 30s tops.<br/><br/>Highly recommended. Bad writing and dragged into 8 episodes of approx. an hour each. It would have been good writing based on writing skills alone and not the content which was horrible but the last 45 minutes of the final episode is what makes up the entire season. It felt like the writers just wanted to finish off in a thrilling scene but unfortunately it makes up for a rush ending. Watch the final episode and its more than enough to vaguely know what the fuss is about.<br/><br/>And yes, it's all Gone Baby Gone dragged till death. Skip it. Not sure why some people rate it low. I guess each to his own. I liked it. Well done. A bit slow but that is the way the show goes. Season 1 - amazing.
Season 2 - pretty good, but the plot line was a bit convoluted. The second season of True Detective is beyond bad. I watched the entire season thinking at some point it would get better. However, the best thing about the second season was the clever online comments the day after each episode aired. Terrible acting and a horrible story line. Don't waste your time. A lot of dialog plus micro expressions plus you need to know a bit about southern culture a bit. But it is realistic southern culture not stereotype. Matthew is not as over bearing like George Clooney doing voice overs. It is more liquid. Woody is one of my favorite actors and really a good complement to Matthew's brooding and darkness. Michelle is great here too and I am wondering what she will bring. Maybe an affair with Matthew's character.<br/><br/>This is going to be a good series. I really like how they use the color too. And the dialog is so infectious that you really have to tune into it. A DVR is a must. So many clues and back-story.I know that IMDb has these robots that will invalidate 10 out of 10 reviews , so I am giving it a nine so my vote counts. That's how good this one is. "We are things that labor under the illusion of having a self, that accretion of sensory experience and feelings, programmed with total assurance that we are each somebody, when in fact everybody's nobody I think the honorable thing for our species to do is to deny our programming. Stop reproducing, walk hand in hand into extinction – one last midnight, brothers and sisters opting out of a raw deal" - Rust Cohle (Matthew McConaughey), True Detective<br/><br/>Whilst Rust's take on the human condition is decidedly nihilistic, it contains flashes of truth, revealing a thinker unafraid to contemplate the unsettling void that lurks behind the sanitized everyday reality of human experience and Western society. Here's a man who has stared into the abyss, who has seen humankind at its worst, and the abyss has stared back into him.<br/><br/>Mesmerizing is the word that comes to mind to describe True Detective. I was transfixed by the beauty, the desolation and the emptiness of the natural world in the show's Louisana setting. Somehow the timelessness and the indifference of the landscape... the swamps, the trees, the waterways... managed to convey a sense of the utter insignificance of the human drama, scattered across this stark, vast landscape like specks of dust in the wind.<br/><br/>True Detective doesn't cower from the horror of its content, in fact the entire show pulses to the beat of a madman's drum, illuminating human nature in all its weakness, depravity, fragility, irrationality and yet in some strange sense also its divinity. When Rust is in his coma in the final episode, he glimpses something beyond his limited sense of self and his bitter nihilistic views, a dissolution of boundaries, a love that transcends that hollow creature he has become. Was it believable? Perhaps it's impossible to act something like that and convey such an experience in its full power. But there was something there that called to me.<br/><br/>I was moved, enthralled and transfixed through all eight episodes. Exceptional and talented acting from both Harrelson and McConaughey, in what for me was perhaps the crowning performance of both their careers (especially given McConaughey's nauseating rom-com fare of recent years). The show reminds me in some ways of Twin Peaks, and takes a spot in my heart alongside that and The Wire. Highly recommended. The only reason this doesn't get 10 stars is because of season 2. Season 2 is good, but just doesn't quite have the same feeling as the other two seasons. Sort of out of place for this series. However this show is spectacular, unique, dark, and intriguing. Not to mention outstanding casting in every season Finished Season 3 with Mahershala and Carmen. Entirely moved and at a loss for words really. This season was beautiful crafted and executed from start to finish. The last 2 episodes were art pieces. At times I felt as though I was in a Broadway theatre. The character development that occurred towards the end was mesmerizing. Truly a masterpiece. After binge watching season one, I got to say I don't know why it took me so long to start watching.
I'm hard to impress with TV shows, I'm much more of a book person, since I've always believed that you cannot bring true emotion or thoughts of the depth of characters, but this show does it so simple and so truthful.
This is a masterpiece. An outstanding series, funs of action, drama, detective series and Lovecraft will love it. Specially season 1. Highly recommend it! All the King in Yellow and the symbols of Hastur in season 1 will certainly give the chills to all the Lovecraftian horror funs out there. Also actors and casting in general gave their best, amazing performances not for sore eyes for sure. When I first started watching the season 1, as a non-american, the slow, dragging pace of the show with the southern drawl put me off, and I had to use subtitles. And I thought it was a boring show, and this is not for me. But I kept going, because I don't like starting something & not finishing it. Since the third episode it kept getting better. Cohle's character kept getting relatable, and I could see the world through his eyes clearly. And as the episodes kept going, my respect for this beautiful show grew more, with some great acting that felt so real sometimes, the hypocrisy of people and all, portrayed quite well. In the final episode, I was on the edge of my seat. And what a powerful dialogue to end the effing perfect episode, that light-dark trope, but done right. I'm glad I watched this show, it truly is one of the best, atleast the first season is, because that's all I've watched so far. At the end I was literally mouthing "You are True Detectives", especially you Cohle, to go out of your way like that... Good title. A solid investigation series. Season 1 complements season 3 beautifully. An outstanding 10/10 Season 1 is a gem that you should watch to believe.<br/><br/>Though I wasn't always following the plot and the story throughout the eight episodes, the overwhelming atmosphere, acting, music and scenery always dragged me back into the show and had my attention focused.<br/><br/>At last a show that does not shy away in showing intense scenes and beauties!<br/><br/>Will update my review as soon as I watch season 2 and 3, but so far, it is almost on par with Breaking Bad.<br/><br/>Matthew McConaughey nails it! It is some times hard to watch showing 3 time lines in the same movie and the same place is not a very good idea i think some times they missed the right place for every time line and i think it had too much romance inside it and family stuff men you are making a crime and a mystic story not a romance movie but after all it had a so so story and a good ending i preferred the first season I loved the first season, I mean, I loved it cos it was brilliant. Matthew McConaughey aced it. And Woody Harelson acted like he was born to do that role.
Then with so much hope I started on second season, and Colin Farrel and Vince Vaughn, did a good job, but the essence kind of moved away from a detective story to something like internal affairs.
But the third season has come back strongly, had Marshala Ali - quite a natural. Stephen Dorf and him did a magic. This time, it was a bit more closely knit on to families and people than ever and a bit more intense. Lot less action, but I loved it. I haven't seen season 2 or 3 yet so, my rating is for season 1 alone, and wow..it was like an 8 hour long neo-noir, incredibly dark movie that had horror elements to be honest, at least for me.. Season 1: 10/10. An absolute masterpiece, amazing acting, great writing and overall character development. A deep, gripping psychological thriller, some great action scenes as well. I literally watched all 8 episodes in a row and re-watched several times afterwards.<br/><br/>Season 2: 7/10. I think most people hated it, because it didn't fulfill their expectations as a follow up to the brilliant first season. However, it's not nearly as bad as people say it is, if you treat it as a stand-alone feature. The acting is decent and there's plenty of tension throughout. I'd say it's more of a fast-paced action flick, compared to the slower-paced and dramatic 1st season. It's certainly worth watching.<br/><br/>Season 3: 7/10. After 2nd season's disappointment for many fans, the series reverted back to the original, slow-paced psychological thriller formula of the first season. While the writing in Season 1 was so strong that the slow pacing was almost a necessity in order to process all the information, Season 3 simply seems to be a bit boring at times, unfortunately (FYI, I like slow-paced films my favorite director is Tarkovsky). I'd break it down like this: Episodes 1-3 were extremely slow, episodes 4-7 were much more interesting and intense and episode 8 was disappointing and predictable. The reason I'm giving it 7/10 is the acting and directing, which were both very good, especially given the somewhat simplistic, predictable and uninteresting writing, compared to previous seasons. Is it worth watching? Well, if you'd seen the first two seasons, you'll probably watch this one as well, but don't expect too much. Having been sufficiently impressed by "The Wire", I was looking for something similar, with serious detective stuff and at the same time a story arc which digs deeper into the flaws of the characters themselves. And True Detective achieves it in style. Every single performance in all the three seasons, is nothing short of captivating. The acting is Oscar-worthy almost throughout.<br/><br/>A riveting storyline, complete with artistically done flashbacks to build the story, and enough surprises along the way, make this series interesting and intriguing. Does it go slow at times? Yes it does, but that's the only way certain character sketches can be fully drawn. You need all the backstories to start appreciating why the characters do whatever it is that they end up doing, even if some of those actions can be deemed as dubious.<br/><br/>It is difficult for any show to stand in the league of The Wire or Breaking Bad. But this one comes very very close. And that's quite an achievement The makeup artists for this show deserve awards as well as the rest. The script, the editing, the directing the acting, the music choice are all gripping, wrenching, involving, upsetting, moving and believable. So well done, that if it weren't so intense, I'd binge it but as it is, you need time to process the information as you, along with them put together the pieces to solve the mystery.
(The makeup, is incredible. 3 time periods and with enough subtle differences, I found myself wondering which time period is the real of the actors and had to look up their ages to remind myself what is the truth of them.) I see that this show has gotten tons of great reviews. I wonder how many of the 9s and 10s were written by people who didn't watch all 8 episodes. If I had reviewed this show after the first two episodes, then I would have given it a 9 or a 10. This show is largely a murder mystery, and lots of mysteries start off as 9s and 10s. That is because it isn't that hard to start a great mystery. It is easy for a writer to dump a bunch of strange clues on the viewer to create the mystery. Finishing it is another thing altogether, and this show starts on a massive downhill slide about halfway through the season before it hits bottom in the very unsatisfying last couple of episodes. At the end, it leaves all kinds of plot holes an unfinished story threads, not because it is leaving them for a future season, but because there was never any substance or depth in the story to begin with. The incredible suspense that the story creates in the first few episodes is a cruel hoax. The story eventually turns into a crushingly clichéd conspiracy tale that never explains in any detail who exactly is in on it, why, and what exactly their motivations are. This problem seems to be getting more and more common nowadays – poor storytelling and plot holes, and then the unsatisfied viewer (like myself) being told that story isn't important because "It's about the characters".<br/><br/>I might be willing to buy into the idea that this is a "character study", but the show doesn't succeed in that area either. True Detective spans 17 years, and there is little change or character development that takes place. It also never gives you any background for how they got to be such cold-hearted jerks in the first place. At one point, the two main characters meet, not having seen each other in years. I was really hoping that it would be an opportunity for them to show how much they had grown up, changed, and improved as human beings, but nope. Other than their appearance, they are the same people that they were at the show's start. For all of the insanity that these two guys have experienced, it hardly seems to have affected them much. The only evidence of an arc for one of the characters occurs in the final five minutes of the last episode. The show occasionally sprinkles in some themes like God, timelessness, and life after death, but it does absolutely nothing with them until that final scene. The occasional sprinkling in of these themes feels more like a teaser to make the story look smarter than it is.<br/><br/>Another big problem with the "character" portion of this show is that a big chunk of it involves Woody Harrelson's crappy marriage. His wife is a crabby bitch (and a poorly acted one at that) and he is unfaithful. Every scene between the two of them basically sucks, and there wasn't a single family-related scene that I think added value to the series.<br/><br/>Make no mistake though, Woody Harrelson (who I have thought for a long time is underrated and under-appreciated) and Matthew McConaughey provide a couple of incredible acting performances. Especially McDonaughey, who is virtually unrecognizable here. I have never seen him in a role like this -- I have only seen him play cheery romantic cowboy types. In this series (which alternates between flashbacks and present day), he is made more unhandsome than I thought was possible. Woody Harrelson is also excellent in this series, although his character horribly annoying and unsympathetic. I still think that each of these characters is good in a vacuum, but unfortunately, they don't work as a "buddy cop" pair. The "buddy cop" thing needs contrasts and opposites – see Benson and Stabler (Law and Order: SVU) or Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker. In True Detective, they occasionally get it right, but more often than not, it's a contest between the two of them to see who can be more of a horrible human being. They are both detestable, with the only difference being that McConaughey is straightforward and honest about who he is.<br/><br/>The other highly redeeming quality of this show is its production values – more specifically, the music. The music is highly unsettling and it contributes heavily to the uneasy atmosphere that pervades the entire series. I just wish that the music had been put into a great horror movie instead of having been wasted on the mediocre story in this series. The cinematography is also really good, and the way that almost every scene has an oil refinery in the background is a peculiar (but accurate) twist on the Louisiana visuals. That stuff falls into the "style" category though, and unfortunately, there is not enough substance here. I'm giving this series a 7 because despite its low points and its disappointing resolution though, because it kept me entertained. It is worth watching just to see Matthew McConaughey's occasional dark brooding soliloquys and the puzzled reactions of those around him. It is worth watching to see Woody Harrelson in action and to see the occasional brilliant exchange of dialog between the two actors. I don't agree with the 9s and 10s for this show, but I can understand why some people love it as much as they do. True Detective has redeeming qualities, but if you ask me, it comes up too short in the story department to be one of the all time greats. I wanted this to be an amazing show. I wanted the dark and brooding atmosphere to somehow be set alight. I wanted the two stars to stun me as they have done all of their careers.<br/><br/>A girl can't always get what she wants...unfortunately.<br/><br/>I am sorry, but I go totally against the crowd on this show. I found it more of a doused fire than a slow burner. I watched every episode, but to be honest it took me four hours to get through number seven...I found myself pausing it and cleaning my bathroom, doing laundry, taking out the rubbish and cleaning out a small closet. I had to force myself to sit down and watch it...number eight as well.<br/><br/>It wasn't just myself...colleagues and friends, both male and female, felt the same as I did. Most stopped watching near episode five and six. I'm so disappointed...such amazing actors in such a dull show. This is a truly awful series.<br/><br/>I am compelled to write a review in order to tell the truth about how totally bad this series is.<br/><br/>Honestly I am convinced the absurdly glowing reviews are from those with a sheep mentality who can't think for themselves.<br/><br/>There's a lot of that going on these days -- especially in the left.<br/><br/>These reviewers mistake total boredom for brooding. It's not brooding. Its a facsimile of brooding that these clowns can't recognize.<br/><br/>I was bored out of my mind.<br/><br/>The "plot"<br/><br/>The lives of two detectives, Rust Cohle and Martin Hart, become entangled during a 17-year hunt for a serial killer in Louisiana. In the land of Fast Food TV, where mindless shows are churned out faster than cheeseburgers at McDonald's, along comes True Detective. One of the most thought provoking and intelligent dramas I have seen in a long time.<br/><br/>The series examines the lives of two Louisiana detectives, Rust Cohle (Matthew McConaughey) and Martin Hart (Woody Harrelson) across a 17 year span as they search to find a serial killer. The story begins in the 2012 when Hart and Cohle are being separately interviewed by 2 investigators regarding the events surrounding a ritualistic murder that they supposedly solved back in 1995. The story frequently flashes back to 1995 and forward to 2002 and then forward again to the present as each investigator takes us through the steps of their investigation. However, as the story develops, we learn more and more about the detectives themselves, their personal lives and their interactions with each other and the people around them. THIS is where the story really is. This is NOT your typical shoot-em-up cop show. If that's what you're looking for, then you will be sorely disappointed because that's not what True Detective is about. This is more of character driven series and these characters are so very-well written! It's easy to become immersed in them as the story progresses!<br/><br/>McConaughey is outstanding in his portrayal of Rust Cohle; a dark, brooding, yet highly intelligent and incredibly focused individual who teeters on the edge of the psychotic. Rust is a stoic - almost emotionless man - devoid of just about all compassion as a result of a traumatic past that eventually landed him in a mental institution. He has basically nothing left in his personal life except the job to which he is completely absorbed.<br/><br/>Harrelson's Martin Hart is a flawed man with many issues - many of which he keeps concealed. He cheats on his wife and is prone to emotional outbursts of anger. His family life is completely dysfunctional. His wife, Maggie (Michelle Monaghan) tries to cope with Hart's frequent absence from the home. He is far more emotional than Cohle and he simply doesn't get him. The friction between the two eventually leads to breakdown in their working as well personal relationship.<br/><br/>The acting is superb and both actors are flawless as they play younger and older versions of themselves. McConaughey is a real surprise as Cohle. I honestly never thought of him as a serious actor before, but he completely loses himself in this character. I see an Emmy in his future! The dialog, while complex, is very thought provoking and the narration draws you in. I find myself more hooked with each episode. So sad that there are only 2 left for this season! <br/><br/>So if you are looking for a gritty, intellectual drama that keeps you on your toes and keeps you thinking and it doesn't try to distract you with mindless action and pointless plots, then True Detective is for you. Highly recommended! The first thing you want to do after watching 'True Detective' is to pack your bags and take a trip to Louisiana. Breathtakingly shot, fabulously acted (particularly a certain Matthew McConaughey) and flawlessly written.The Background score, editing, directing, production design are all A-grade. The show is dark, pagan themed and the story does take its time to roll out. <br/><br/>Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson play two detectives assigned to investigate the murder of a 'girl in the woods' with mysterious symbolic clues around the murder site. Later, the pair deduce that this is an act of a serial killer. The series follows their quest for this killer along with their character development. <br/><br/>'True Detective' possibly has the best pilot season of all good TV series, and if it does carry on like this, might end as one of the best TV shows of all time. OK so let me say I'm still a lil upset that HBO cancelled ROME. Yeah I know that was a long time ago but so what I loved that damn show so I can hold a grudge right? Now that I got that out of my system I gotta say TRUE DETECTIVE is magnificent and if you're a fan of shows like DEXTER then you're going to love this. Woody Harellson and Matthew Mcconaughey are like a twisted version of the odd couple, one trying to live life as most do and acting like everything is a OK. The other living in a more dark and possibly sinister reality, where everything is meaningless and futile. They are on the hunt for a killer of women in a down south community which may hold a dark and disturbing secret. This show really grabs you and leaves you wanting more and it is so creatively written that there is really no telling where it can go next. HBO has really been the benchmark for fresh and exciting new television and I think they have struck gold again. If you enjoy a dark and twisted version of a fine modern detective drama then TRUE DETECTIVE is one to check out. Who owed someone a favor and let that theme music/talk stick? I Tried to reply to same comment but a series that content, creators and acting of such high caliber be taken to the curb by the horrible theme "music?" Or should I say lyrics is a shame. Everyone DVR's it to avoid it so we can enjoy the show without saying why is that so horrible? it drags the show down to a b level before it gets s chance with people I recommend watch it. They can't get past the theme and tune out. So I ask them to "DVR and pass it by it's a great show!!!" They say OK but if not on HBO and was syndicated on general cable with commercials I couldn't place a client without the condition the ad runs in the show and not near open and close. Have to agree with other posts about how horrible it is. Please change it and find something worthy that the quality show deserves. Even the x file instrumental would be an improvement. It's HBO!!! Not a uuutoob post. This is NOT what you call "Television". This is an 8 hour movie one could consume in one sitting; If it were a movie it would be worthy of a Best Picture Oscar....With tension on the scale of Silence of the Lambs, and superior character development. Definitely better than the other 2013 detective shows I watched like Almost Human, Sherlock, and Hannibal...not that those are horrible...True Detective is just way less boring, far more entertaining and intellectual, and more realistic than all those other shows. If you consider the amount of bullets flying or fights in the first three episodes, TD can be called slow in its pacing, yet the character developing and the character development are addictively riveting. The gruesomeness is somewhat akin to Hannibal but the atmosphere of despair, tension, and reality is far better suspending through the impeccable acting and phenomenal script writing. Major props to McConaugahey, Harrelson, and their team. They are truly adept at their art. My husband and I both fell asleep half way through the 1st episode and it reminded me of a few reviews we read earlier that said so...its like two old men doing everything in slow motion...like taking the cigarette out and putting it in the mouth takes 5 seconds. Filled with unrelated and unnecessary scenes...lots of slang and slurs...Everyone in the show is depressed and angry all the time...They always talk slow and in whispers...I get it its Matthew's style but didn't expect the whole series to be this slow. Its like a lullaby seriously! I always loved detective and fast paced thriller stories...starting from the time of 'Twin Peaks' and 'X-Files' to 'Bones' and 'Castle'...Thriller only suits with fast pace ..just because two big stars are doing the lead role, I won't rate it high! Sorry! Pairing up Harrelson and McConaughey was brilliant. The casting director or whomever actually makes the executive decision nailed it here. I have to ask the obvious...why weren't these two paired in a movie version of this? This is where cable TV is blowing the socks off movies today...the character depth and story lines go so far beyond what a two hour movie can ever do.<br/><br/>Thanks to Homicide: Life on the Streets which led to The Sopranos then Six Feet Under and The Wire, especially The Wire, we now have storytelling as an art form.<br/><br/>Hollywood is much the same as the show Shark Tank. Someone has a great idea, they are in process of getting the idea launched, but unless there is security involved, the major players who boast of their confidence pass. A great idea is a great idea! Both Harrelson and McConaughey take their star power to a whole new level. Especially Matthew...he just throws down this role like a slam dunk. It is 100% catered to his acting style and persona. Same with Woody. The supporting cast know their roles and add all the needed colors to make this show work at the highest level.<br/><br/>Yes...it is slow paced, but that is the art. Similar to The Killing, the pace only draws you in deeper. The writing is the silent star much like a music score is when watching a great movie. Someone took a degree in philosophy and theology and did something with it. If you really listen to McConaughey's lines, they are wrapped in both logic and humanity. Agree or disagree with his position, that is one thing, but to take this insight into written form hoping an actor can pull it off...now we are back to art.<br/><br/>Much respect.<br/><br/>Sit back and enjoy... I'm a long time mystery/suspense buff, from classic film noir like "The Third man" to modern day, independently produced films like the wonderfully twisted, suspense thriller "Hard Candy". I'm a big Hitchcock fan, as well as great mystery novel writers. There are so many varieties of mystery and suspense and I enjoy them all. But, The best murder mystery has that tight wire suspense woven into the very fabric of the story. To achieve that atmosphere there are a few key elements that MUST be present; A well thought out and engaging plot with enough information about the mystery that you can speculate about possible suspects, great character development,(you need to feel invested in the characters, this includes the villains) and when and how clues are revealed. In "True Detective" we discover the clues at the same time as the detectives do in the flashbacks, we are given as much information as they at the time, but in the "present day" interviews we know, they know much, much more and this information is slowly revealed to us. It's great fun to try and work the case with them and you never have to wait too long to see if were right about a particular situation. Last, but by no means least - the element of surprise or the "Unknown." Something unexpected happens or someone does or says something that takes you completely by surprise, the proverbial "twist", which if done right brings us into that taught, dark area of suspense. This is by far the hardest of all the sub-genres of mystery to achieve. "True Detective" delivers on all fronts and exceeds expectations. TD is a multi-faceted story with superb acting, cinematography, writing, editing, perfect locations and deeply detailed sets. So far, I have not found any aspect of the production that is lacking. Thus the 10 | 10 rating, which is rare for me. <br/><br/>I love the gritty juxtaposition of the characters, sets and dialog. From the opening credits of "True Detective" you get a sense of the show's uniqueness. From the song by The Handsome Family "Far From Any Road" to the striking layered images of key cast members overlayed with shots of ordinary and extraordinary objects and the environment where the story takes place. <br/><br/>"True Detective" is a slow burn mystery, it's not boring by any means but, It's certainly not for folks looking for lots of gratuitous violence, action, sex and a slapped together confession at the end to wrap things up. "True Detective" is a mystery/crime drama for people who enjoy to be challenged on many levels.<br/><br/>"True Detective" is suspense as it should be done and the show takes the time to allow the viewers to become invested in the characters and the story. Revelations are always happening, but in a more realistic way. Some are obvious and in your face, while others are much more subtle. There's so much more going on under the surface. <br/><br/>A good example of this can be found in the two leads - Woody Harrelson who plays Detective Martin Hart and Matthew McConaughey who plays Detective Rust Cohle. Rust is seen at first blush as the damaged one, the unstable one and Martin as the true blue, solid as a rock cop, who goes by the book, but as time goes on and the story unfolds, you see that this isn't really the case at all. Just the opposite is true. <br/><br/>As Hart talks of rules and boundaries in the "present day" interviews we see his actions from the past betray his words and/or wishes. Cohle on the other hand is like a priest or philosopher, not only in the "present day" interviews but also in the flashbacks. He's constantly aware of the "inside" joke, he's the one who can "see" what's really going on. His eyes are wide open - he suffers from insomnia, he literally sees things others cannot and this profoundly changes the way he views and interacts with himself and the world. The numbing protective layer that society has applied to the human experience through religion, social norms and practices, our society's black and white view of justice have been burned away for Cohle, which gives him a form of second sight.<br/><br/>They give several explanations on why Cohle "sees things", they even do an episode called "Seeing Things" (Ep.2 Season 1) In Cohle's mind it's the death of his daughter and end of his marriage and the ensuing chain reaction that followed his own personal tragedy, the story reveals to us he has a rare neurological condition called synesthesia, which is a neurological phenomenon in which stimulation of one sensory or cognitive pathway leads to automatic, involuntary experiences in a second sensory or cognitive pathway. <br/><br/>3 Episodes in and "True Detective" has become my favorite crime drama. I've already re-watched it several times and each time I watch an episode over, I see something new, a small detail I didn't notice the first time that makes me view everything in a different light. For example: Cohle's mirror - his apartment is sparse, monk like even. It's almost empty and makes Hart feel sorry for Cohle. What is in his space are only the bare necessities. He has a mirror that is only as big as one eye. This small detail is not verbally addressed, it's on screen for barely a minute, if you blink you could easily miss it. He stands there before a mostly bare wall and with one eye stares into himself. The only pictures he has are of "DB's" (dead bodies) which he also stares intently at for hours at a time, all the books he owns are about crime, psychology,crime research and of course his own large notebook, which earned him the nickname of "The Taxman". <br/><br/>I can't wait for the next episode. 10 stars , I highly recommend this series and suggest a binge watch. The first and second episodes manage to build an exciting atmosphere around a series of occult killings. Strange testimonies, as-well as supernatural visuals build incredible suspense and premonition about what could have been a great thriller-detective show. Fans of Robert E.Chambers and HP.Lovecraft will recognize certain elements and this aids in building incredible suspense.<br/><br/>In Episode 3 and forward all such elements have been forgotten forever, and instead the show relies on stereotypical cop-show troupes and characters which are sometimes interrupted by a repetition of some aspect already encountered in the first 2 episodes. Unlike a good detective-show however, no mysteries or motivations are solved along the way up until the very last episode where the show is quickly wrapped up in the most stereotypical and disappointing end-scene imaginable.<br/><br/>A run of the mill cop soap-opera, occasionally sprinkled with elements of a much better show. True Detective Season 3 (2019)<br/><br/>Four years in the making and it is finally here with the same dark and rough feel of Season 1. Small rural town in US, mean people and a twisted crime that takes 35 years to solve. The narrative seamlessly transitions between 3 different timelines and gradually reveals small pieces of the plot.<br/><br/>Mahershala Ali grows with every role that he takes and here he embodies the entire series and I dare say that this is his best acting. As the plot moves between 80s, 90s and present he moves along with it depicting 3 different personalities and living the role. Bravo Sir!<br/><br/>Overall a seemingly simple tale at first but like all good things, biggest mysteries take time to unfold. Superb production and cinematography with fantastic acting and dialogues. Obviously it is not better that S1 but it does have a very similar feel so you wont be disappointed. If you have never seen the show then check out the trailer and dive into the world of true crime. I am a very very very very big fan of TD but when I say this then its only meant for the season 1. Every moment of S1 is so connecting and keeps involved. Star cast obviously can't be better than those two. Best Best Best.
Here I skip the review of season 2 as its a normal one to watch and feel.
Now I talk about S3 which I ended just now and really made me to write this review after it, I never bothered before but this made me doing this work.
First the casting of this season is unfit. From the first scene to the last Mr. Hays had the same expression. This main character I dont like at all. He doesnt have any charm to love his character, he is so plain and simple. His wife amelia also had the same things which he does. Seeing both of them was the most irritating thing and I must say it is not about Mr Ali and Mrs Ejogo's real acting skills, it is about the character they are playing. The second useful character made here is Mr Roland west and this character even had some balls and some nasty and interesting stuffs to remember later.
Mr HOYT is a big businessman here but the casting isnt fit for him too.. he comes in with two black luxury sedans and looks like a pocket thief. The so called suspense opened in the last episode which was hahahahahahahaha so unsatisfying. They took 35+ years to solve a case like this Lmfao. Yes I have a reason why? coz Mr Hays is the dumbest character here.. this dumbest character should have played woodard here and not the detective. Even woodard would be more intelligent character.
I am the biggest critic of this season and nobody dislikes this season more than me. I truly wasted 8 hours, instead I should have watched s1 again.
I gave 5 stars which I tell you all. First season is 10 on 10. second season I dont remember as it doesnt have anything to remember just watch and forget but the third season have my ratings in hundreds of minus. No enjoyment at all.
This third season is like a copy paste of season 1 on many things.. like the same dark country side direction, same long smoking drives, old and young story tellers and so on but you did a very bad copy paste this time.
(This review is solely on what I perceived, seen and felt from and not to hurt anybody's emotion, this is only how I feel after watching season 3 as I expected obviously not this.)
(Mr Pizzolato is a great storyteller but sorry sir not this time according to me) Season 1 and 2 were great,but season 3 unfortunately up to ep 3 real slow and hard to keep your attention, needs to get a move on. The first season was OK - an honest 8.5 out of 10 - maybe 8 - I h8 to exaggerate :) ... The cast and the story , plot were all good - Especially - The leading character played by - Mathew Mcconaughey was really good ... There was enough mystery and pretty intelligent kind of drama - I am not a drama Fan , but mystery - bring it on ... I like Sci Fi , action , comedy more than Drama , But from time to time - A good drama will pop up - Examples: - Breaking Bad and the NEW TV SHOW - MR. ROBOT - which can surpass Breaking Bad easily ... I honestly found the show ( 1st season ) to be amusing and interesting as far as drama can be for me - so I stayed with it , finished watching it ... I wasn't really desperate for season 2 as I can be for many other Shows... I consider myself to be intelligent - but I can get bored by lots of things... NOW - Season 2 - First episode - I watched it with a friend of mine - After 10 minutes in the episode - I asked him what he thinks - He only said - I like this Actor - He is good ... OK, Some 30 minutes later- I asked the same question - And my friend ( who can be very shallow ) - again said - I know this actors too - they are also good and star in some good movies ... At that point I got so mad and asked him: - Actors aside - Tell me what you think of the episode ??? - We both agreed that it was VERY BORING... Another friend of mine - also fascinated by the First Season - Unlike me - watched the first 5 episodes of season 2 - and TOLD ME THIS : - I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW BORING THIS SHOW BECAME COMPARED TO THE FIRST SEASON... MY HONEST RATING FOR SEASON 2 IS - 2.5 OUT OF 10... So , I encourage everyone to watch season 1 because after that this becomes a totally different SHow and a complete disaster... If you are OK with GOOD actors in a Bad and boring season - Please - Go for it and watch the 2nd season as well... I was trying to be as much as honest I can, so I apologize if I hurt your feelings - but this show is a disaster after season 1... Everyone I have asked so far - Agreed and said exactly the same thing ;) I really enjoyed the first season. The story was unique (a bit dull here and there, but it was acceptable), and was acted out very well. In certain moments I was looking for subtitles, but it was easy to ignore the occasional "what did McConaughey just say moments" when there was amazing shot after shot with a near perfect soundtrack. <br/><br/>Then comes season two...<br/><br/>The first episode was bordering on Michael Bay levels of over-sexualized violence and a complete lack of the procedural tone from the first. The director chose to repeat the same shot of Los Angeles freeways that I was honestly groaning with boredom towards the end when they kept cutting back to those shots. The director didn't seem to even slightly want the audience to interpret the characters, he just wanted to cram as much awkward exposition in as possible. The soundtrack sounded almost entirely like a ripoff of Lost, and I felt so painfully compelled to finish the first episode because of the first season. Words cannot describe how much this show turned into a amateur nihilist exposition festival. I couldn't bring myself to watch 5 minutes of the second episode and I'm having trouble distinguishing the two as I write this.<br/><br/>TLDR/In short: I wouldn't put Season 2 of True Detective on my TV even if it was to deter burglars from my house when I was away. I'll probably give it another chance soon. If you have an interesting detective story then get on with the story. We know that both leads are talented actors so why the long tortured monologues? Stereotyping women as accessories in this series was big mistake. This is cable. Be bold. Do something different. Put women in interesting roles or don't bother using them at all. This season relied on teasing the the audience with clues and it dragged on for too many episodes. Because of the sex scenes and personal turmoil of the two leads, I lot track of the clues and minor characters. When that happens, you lose the audiences and you lose the mystery & suspense. The relationship between the leads is interesting. It would be better if McConaughey didn't chew up the scenery so much. Harrelson is doing fine but I feel bad for him because the director & the writers are showcasing his co-star. Harrelson is one of the most underrated actors in the business. He has a wider range of talent and he avoids overacting. It's called discipline. True Detective looks more like a McConaughey vehicle and that's not what I wanted from this series. His long monologues are boring. It's the story - not an acting tutorial. Great TV show all around. Great cast, story.
Just skip season 2 A dull rehash of Season 1.<br/><br/>Whereas Season 1 was partially redeemed by a couple of odd-ball detectives, here the humor has gone missing. Not even Ali's deeply felt performance can make up for the thin material stuffed with clichÃ©s, leaden dialogue, and the monotonous pacing. I can't help having the feeling that in the third season they just tried to repeat the formula from the first season, because I think (maybe all of us) it was better than the second one. They repeat the formula, but like three times. The jumps in time, but not just in two years, but THREE. And the story, I dont know, too much effort, too much mistery but in the end it was all for nothing, the characters just ruined their life for a pointless case. I love True Detective vibe, but I dont get it, dude. Quoting John Mayer's Gravity: Twice as much, aint twice as good. Can't sustain like one half could" This is not a high octane thrill a minute show instead it is a deep dark complex brooding film with thoughtful powerful sensible acting of the stuff seldom seen especially on the tv screen haunting lives damaged love that cannot bare the weight obsession taking hold over a lifetime.
Writing is brilliant acting matches the writing and direction wraps it all up in acomplicated adult drama among the very best I have seen in years
Leaving us to ponder issues of time life love and what it all means.
What is time to each of us ? Although each season leaves you wanting more of the characters, the next season is somehow always just as good.<br/><br/>There's something about this show that makes it feel more "real" than most derivative TV shows in the cop genre. The actors, their characters, the writing, the very precise and controlled use of the cameras and audio, it just works.<br/><br/>I am not usually one for darker shows, but there's something kind of beautiful, introspective, and powerful about this. Like watching a predator breaking cover and making an attempt at a meal. True Detective I: left audience with a sense of hope in a dark landscape.<br/><br/>True Detective II: forced the audience to swallow utter desolation of the protagonists. Not a good time.<br/><br/>The only reason this was given a rating 5 was that ALL of the actors were OUTSTANDING! Every one of them was wonderful which made the plot devices all-the- more-miserable.<br/><br/>Game of Thrones is a mess, plagiarizing Tolkien and Ann McAffrey's Dragon Riders series until Martin can't figure out how to complete a story arc so he resorts to the lazy way out: kill off what he won't bother explaining. Nic Pizzolato is better than this.<br/><br/>Also, it's against the laws of God and man to kill off Colin Farrell and Vince Vaughn...in the words of Jim Croce: <br/><br/>"You don't tug on Superman's cape You don't spit into the wind You don't pull the mask off that old Lone Ranger And you don't mess around with Jim" This is an amazing story, as dark and as gritty as anything I have seen on television. McConaughey and Harrelson give the performances of the year, and probably the decade. The love/hate relationship between the two main character, as well as the development of the two make you sincerely care about what happens to them. This isn't a show about knights in shining armor coming to the rescue of the damsel in distress. This story will show you the flaws of the characters as much as their strengths, perhaps even more. The plot is intricate, but linear enough to keep you on track and wanting more. This series is not for the faint of heart, but I would recommend this series to anyone looking for a genuinely good story. Easily the best ten hours I have spent in front of the television. If you take the time to soak in the characters and pay attention to the dialogue, you will appreciate it for the beautiful masterpiece that it is. Very well written and acted. Cinematography was top notch. Very eerie at times. Makeup fantastic as well. Mahersha and Dorf has amazing chemistry. Acting all around was on point. Only gripe I had is it can get a little confusing keeping track of the three different timelines, but once you get it down and all know all the characters by name, you will love it. No clue why the bad reviews. Perhaps people grew impatient. It took me a few episodes as well and several sittings to even get through the first three, but after episode 4 I was glued. Enjoy! Season 1 - Fantastic
Season 2 - gave up
Season 3 - terrible (please don't bother) Loved season 1 & 2. So looking forward to season 3 after a few years off. The directing, makeup, cinematography, mood lighting...everything right on par. But man this story was honestly boring. 2/3 of story line was kind of pointless. You think it is going to finally pick up, then it doesn't. I came back this weekend to watch episode 9 only to find out Episode #8 was the end of the season. Smh. Ummm, okay? Season 1 opened to rave reviews and desperate to find something that would live up to the great HBO shows that preceded it I started watching with eager anticipation, I like Harrelson and MM and their acting didn't disappoint but I felt the show was a little slow and the plot rather static but in the absence of anything else to watch at the time I stuck it out though it needed a lot of resolution so to do. anyway a disappointment but just about watchable. Again as a box set addict I thought I would try our season 2 , really just couldn't believe the 1st episode ; it was just awful in fact I turned off after about 30 mins , now contemplating whether to give season 3 a chance It was the best decision they could make to create this in the mini- series format where each season is its own story of several hours, it means things are built with an approaching end in sight, limits. I don't like the prevalent series format that drags on for years, the sense that it's just a product and a weekly habit being prolonged and not a narrative.<br/><br/>Once inside I find a writer (this is his project) who likes to harp on about his pessimist view of life as some meaningless void and that keeps me at bay. It's not 'too dark' for me in the sense meant by some, a sign of bravery in facing deep truths. I find 'too dark' as fundamentally untrue as 'too light', an unnecessary distortion of life, only one more veil. The universe neither cares nor doesn't and we either want to see the makings of things clearly or pick from a bag of philosophies that justify the anxiety.<br/><br/>But we also see a maker (the original writer) who is not content to envision life as a capricious maze full of dead ends, broken marriages and frustrated clarity. There has to be a lurid monster on the other end of that maze, a conspiracy for evil. The Louisiana story with the ritualistic murder of girls is reported as more exciting; but that's an admission that we want to be secretly titillated by an inane evil to keep our interest, Silence of the Lambs territory.<br/><br/>I prefer the LA story in terms of world it creates. It does take place in much the same world as Ellroy writes about, another one who titillates, it does also begin with a violated corpse, ends with conspiracy that goes all the way up. But we lose the sophomoric rebuttals of the protagonist, we lose the backwoods monster, the riddle solving, and get instead the big city and weary burnouts clutching at last hope. The first one still has better actors, structure and sense of place and of course titillates more.<br/><br/>The relationship between the Vaughn gangster and his spirited woman is the most profound thing I saw in the whole thing so far.<br/><br/>So this is held up as great television, I see it as fine, some things I care to see, others not. I'll come back to it at some point. When it comes to making choices of what to carry going forward, I'll still gravitate back to The Long Goodbye and Killing of a Chinese Bookie. I watched the first season from start to finish and thought it was spectacular. So refreshing and different from everything else out right now. But the second season is totally wrong. Everything about it is wrong from the casting to location to script to directing to soundtrack. It's all bad. Just god awful. Poor Rachel McAdams is the only bright light on the whole debacle she really shines as a brooding tough detective surrounded by a bunch of bumbling idiots.Vince Vaughn who is just awful as a shady mob figure completely is completely wrong for his role. I keep waiting for him to be funny and tell a joke. Colin Farrell is s boring and gives a lackluster performance leaving you scratching your head at what the hell he is even doing on the show. I'd rather see him in " Phone Booth " again then in this show. I hope next season redeems itself and saves a great cable show before it's too late. Season 1... amazing. Watch it. Absolutely loved it. What a cast too.
Season 2... amazing. Great story, love Colin Farrell too.
Season 3... what?... I can't understand a word they're saying. Couldn't follow the story. No clue what's going on. abandoned it half way through. Script is very realistic and acting is very good. It is no doubt that this is one of the best show of detective.
The describe of detective's life and the approaching to case are very real and very impressive. Season 1 and 3 are amazing! This is some of the very best TV series of all time. Unreal good. Woody and Matthew are so good in season 1 that the show is addictive. An interesting take on an often used crime plot of children missing - what happened; who's the culprit, etc. We go through the usual misdirections ranging from the highest levels of society to the bottom, and of course some w/not so good outcomes. Usual filing time w/backgrounds on personal lives of our detectives. The usual slightly dysfunctional personal, professional relations; some w/superiors. Acting, dialogue, writing creativity, sets all good. My negative is w/the excessive flashbacks - gets tedious; breaks up the natural flow. "True Detective" Season Three is the third season of the so far consistently great (yes, even the incredibly underrated Season Two) HBO show; "True Detective". Each season contains two lead detective characters played by extremely talented actors. Season One was Matthew McConaughey ("Killer Joe" / "Dallas Buyers Club") and Woody Harrelson ("Natural Born Killers" / "Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"). Season Two was Vince Vaughn ("Wedding Crashers" / "Brawl in Cell Block 99") and Colin Farrell ("Phone Booth" / "Seven Psychopaths"). This third season contains Mahershala Ali ("Moonlight" / "Green Book") and Stephen Dorff ("Felon" / "Leatherface").<br/><br/>Season Three is a crime drama that jumps between 1980, 1990, and 2015, it is about Arkansas detective Wayne Hays (Mahershala Ali) who spends decades investigating the murder of a young boy and the kidnapping of sister - a crime he had investigated w/ his then partner detective Roland West (Stephen Dorff).<br/><br/>Firstly all the directors; Jeremy Saulnier (E01 / E02), Daniel Sackheim (E03 / E06 / E07 / E08) and Nic Pizzolatto (E04 / E05), all do an absolute phenomenal job in their respected directing duties. Each episode is never drastically different from the previous and maintains a very dark and grim tone to match it's subject matter. Each episode is directed w/ such care and professionalism that it truly is astounding.<br/><br/>The writing is just excellent throughout and maintains a sense of extreme realism that is missing from 95% of crime shows; past and present. It is sharp, realistic, extremely natural and sometimes prophetic. The dialogue just sounds so real when you hear it coming from the actors. It is that sort of writing that helps immerse you in the story and the world it's taking place in. There are two very beautifully noteworthy pieces of writing in E03. The first is during a scene set in the 90's when Roland pays a friendly visit to the missing girl's father; Tom Purcell, and they talk about having moved on and even pray together. The prayer spoken is both beautiful and haunting in the implications it makes of Tom's past. The second is during a scene set in 2015 when Wayne is haunted by figment of his wife, that is in his head. She talks about time being an illusion and seeing the past clearly. It is this sort of dialogue that is a prime example of why this show gets so much well deserved praise.<br/><br/>The cinematography by Germain McMicking (E01 / E02 / E03 / E06 / E07 / E08) and Nigel Bluck (E04 / E05) during this season is mind blowing in how precise and how well thought out it is. When watching this show you feel like you're watching a high budget true crime documentary especially in thanks due to how it is was shot; showing you what's important and drawing you to look all of the screen like a detective would have to. Shots are perfectly framed as such to give you subtle meaning that can't be picked up through the dialogue.<br/><br/>When they say that casting is 90% of directing they are certainly not wrong and especially in regards to this show. Mahershala Ali and Stephen Dorff are excellent as the two lead characters; Wayne Hays and Roland West, but there is also a standout performance by supporting actor Scoot McNairy as Tom Purcell. Mahershala Ali who had won an OSCAR for "Green Book" during the release of this season shows us exactly why he deserved it. Mahershala's performance is one that has such nuances to it and helps you see his character's obsession for finding out what happened as well as showing us a man who is haunted by his past. One minute he's confident and determined, then next he's vulnerable and lost, then he's angry and broken. It's that kind of rapid on and off that Mahershala really shows of his acting in a way that most actors these days can't pull off w/out creating inconsistencies in their character. Stephen Dorff gives an almost equally great performance, one that brings back memories of his excellent performance as Wade Porter in the 2008 Ric Roman Waugh directed and written crime/thriller; "Felon". His performance as Roland West gives us a very great character who is more sympathetic towards victims but also feels more desensitised to the job, than his partner. The character of Roland is one of a man who's bottled up and alone, Stephen's performance accurately represents the character to perfection and you often don't feel like you're watching Stephen Dorff, you feel like God or an outside entity that is just there watching Roland in the life he has created for himself. Both the two leads; Mahershala and Stephen, have excellent chemistry together that you'd be convinced they've known each other for years. It's both of their acting and the previously mentioned excellent dialogue. Scoot McNairy is very much deserving of a PrimeTime Emmy for his performance as the grieving father; Tom Purcell. He's an actor whose career is I have been following for a while now w/ often consistently great performances even in films who's quality is lesser than the acting he is providing. As the character of Tom; Scoot gives such raw emotion of loss that is so convincing in it's authenticity that it almost becomes both heartbreaking and unbearable to watch. Back to what I was saying about the scene between Roland and Tom in E03; the two characters give such a beautiful and real performance together that it makes you feel like some dirty man peaking from behind a key hole, looking in on a formerly grieving man and the detective who cares more than he shows. Carmen Ejogo is in the show as Wayne's wife and former teacher of the Purcell kids; Amelia. While Carmen does give this occasionally deep performance as Amelia, the character herself isn't entirely memorable and just feels there. While important to the plot during a few scenes the character feels inconsistent in what she wants and who she is. Carmen's really good performance is unfortunately not enough to save this character from disappearing to the back of your mind when she's not onscreen.<br/><br/>Other aspects such as editing, costume design and set design are all great. Editing is calm and keeps shots long w/out cutting between different angles/shots like someone w/ ADHD (looking at you "Bohemian Rhapsody"). Costumes accurately representing each individual time period it is set in and are all excellent. Set design is much like the costume design in that it accurately represents the time period w/out fault.<br/><br/>All up this show or rather in particular; this season, is a brilliant piece of TV. Many crime shows these days are still procedural rather than a plot driven. Even some procedural shows like "Law & Order: SVU" now carry continuous subplots throughout their later episodes to standout from the crowd. It is circumstances of other shows that help "True Detective" standout but it is it's own quality that makes it a great show. It's not great just in comparison other shows, it's great on it's own merits and has no one to thank for it except it's own talented team behind. HBO have once again proven themselves the master of drama. While HBO shows are often well written alongside being full on in regards to sex, violence and swearing, this show is the more subtle side of HBO but even w/ it's subtly it is very grim and very bleak. I'd recommend this show and especially this season to anyone who's looking for that next TV show binge. Whether or not they want another crime show, another HBO show or just another show in general.<br/><br/>Rating (Season Three): 9.7/10 S1 was the best and im pretty sure it will the best in the series. It sett a benchmark and introduced that gritty kind of genre that we get to see in the movies for max 100 something minutes. All the cast members & crew killed it.<br/><br/>S2 was exactly the opposite. Sequels are always bad bcz they cant stand up to the expectations...<br/><br/>S3 tbh i tried watching it 4 times but every time i am not able to complete the series..:its too slow and i dare to say it boring...i know im gonna get alot of hate for this...but thats just my pov.. Just finished re-watching season 1. First viewing was in 2014 and this is my second play through (2019) and I cannot stress how much of a triumph this series is. An absolute masterclass in story, script, acting, direction and setting... I feel that coming back to this showed me how low the bar is set for other television shows.<br/><br/>McConaughey plays 'Rust' Cohle, who comes off as somewhat of a caricature in his opening screen time. With his excessive holier-than-thou speeches, pessimistic attitude toward the world and his drink/drug abuse somewhat taking you away from the plot. However Rust's character immediately gets grounded once we understand more about him though flash forwards and flashbacks. It's an incredible piece of film making and one that not many practitioners could pull off, turning a very unlikeable character into someone the audience roots for.<br/><br/>On the flip side, Harrelson's Detective Hart comes across as a lot more grounded, a human touch to the cold character of Rust. Incredibly flawed? Yes. Cheats on his wife, alcoholic, workaholic, overall not too great. Though Harrelson's nuanced performance juxtaposes that of McConaughey's Rust in the best possible way. Adding that essential element of reason and realism so as to not paint Rust as a caricature, as Hart is just as perplexed at Rust's actions as us as an audience.<br/><br/>These 2 powerhouse performances, alongside very capable direction, incredible story and a very tight script, make this an unmissable piece of television. All three seasons are absolutely fantastic. Acting is perfect. Characters developed. Interesting storylines. Mood and setting are intriguing. First two seasons had more pop than the last one, but overall the series remains engrossing, meticulous, well-acted, and expertly paced. Half of the dialogues is just f*** and s***, but in fact it is the only credible half. The rest is a nonsensical sort of dialogue where they say nothing but in a very pompous way. Plot rather confused but mainly confusing, and I am afraid that this is the aim. It's all and only atmosphere (it often works, fortunately), good acting but too acted (director's fault). Very well played and directed. The show goes down many levels in different aspects of characters' life. The story is beautifully written. Season 1 - 10/10<br/><br/>Amazing, some of the best TV ever.<br/><br/>Season 2 - 7/10<br/><br/>I liked it, but there were flaws and can understand why some people didn't enjoy it.<br/><br/>Season 3 - 8/10<br/><br/>An improvement on the second and brought some good ideas. The ending will annoy some, but I quite liked it. 1st season was the best ever, nothing can change that.
2nd was different type, yet less then the original.
3rd is totally different imo. the acting is superb and the main reason to watch it, the crime story is interesting and also the movements between times and years back and forth, but for me it's just the cover story to the real story we get to see which is actually about family, friendships, missed opportunities, the choices people make that simply effects their own life and the life of others. Do not expect to see action scenes in s3, it's different then s2 and s1, is slow paced, and focuses in the acting and relationships between the characters, yet it's amazing. All actors are making a great job, not only the 2 leading roles (well 3 leading roles, the wife is also a leading role not just the detectives). A must see. Season one was amazing! Great Story and great actors.... Season 2 took a huge dive, hoping season 3 can improve dramatically. A thoroughly masterful, well written and extremely well-acted series dissolves into a pathetic and ridiculous joke in the final forty minutes. I expected a lot more than a chance run-in with the Mexicans, whom a real-life Frank would have erased from the planet for cutting the girl, with a greater than ten million to one odds against it, coupled with the absurd notion that Ray would risk everything for a final glimpse at his ungrateful kid, looking back instead of ahead.<br/><br/>I don't know how the show should have ended. I just know that it should have ended with the same intensity that ran through the entire series up to that point. Perhaps this is the best one can expect from American writers. We thank God for British acting, writing and films as they have clever endings to go along with clever, well written and well-acted shows and movies. We expected much more from Woody Harrelson & Matthew McConaughey. What a shame to squander splendid performances by Vince Vaughn & Colin Farrell, making us wonder whether it is worth investing any time in watching the next season. Perhaps we shall watch everything but the final episode and construct our own endings and thereby bypass the disappointment. I watched this in one sitting on DVD. The two main characters turned in flawless performances. The complexity and depth of plot and characterization kept me engrossed and riveted right up until the last few minutes whereby it suddenly took a nose-dive into the shallows of mediocrity. There was a moment when it could have ended more powerfully, when the two men are left and awaiting help. (Are they found in time? Do both live? Only one? etc, etc). But OH NO! The final couple of scenes slip into formulaic "happy-ending" mode with Marty having his "Happy Family-moment", and the otherwise intelligent, and philosophical Cohle having his "God-moment". Oh Pu-lease!!! Matthew McConaughey has truly been on a roll lately. After scene- stealing roles in Killer Joe, Bernie and Magic Mike, he followed up with a brilliant lead performance in Jeff Nichols' Mud, another scene- stealing cameo in Scorsese's Wolf of Wall Street, and a potentially Oscar-winning lead role in Dallas Buyers Club, one of the best films of 2013.<br/><br/>Somewhere in among all those projects he managed to film this HBO miniseries with old pal Woody Harrelson. The result is revolutionary and gripping: an eight-episode miniseries with two huge actors, with a relatively small cast and crew behind it. This is essentially a movie split up into a mini-series but with the concept that each 'season' will feature two new A-list actors. HBO continues to set the bar high for cable programming and storytelling in general.<br/><br/>True Detective just finished up its fourth episode, the strongest yet, which featured an epic six-minute-long one-shot camera take (they may have used some clever editing a la Children of Men but the end result is impressively seamless). This is a great mix of wonderful acting, solid script-writing, and impressive technical direction. The tone of the show is hauntingly eerie and makes good use of its southern locale. <br/><br/>All in all, this could easily go down as one of HBO's premier programs and two of the best performances of its lead actors' respective careers. Who would have ever thought McConaughey would have been in this position a few years ago? Talk about a career revival. The story line is painfully slow, which contributes to losing the plot and interest. The dialogue is very random and half the time I have no idea what they are saying (mumbling and arbitrary digression), also I feel like some scenes are truly unnecessary. <br/><br/>I find Matthew McConaughey to be over acting his character, almost to a point where it is extremely annoying. <br/><br/>I do not see why people are so hyped up about this, after every episode I have to convince myself to watch the next. I only rated it a 5 because I can see a ray of character progression in this, but I find it hard to buy into this case they are "working" on Season 1 was absolutely fantastic. A great 8 hour movie if you're binge watching. I scored this season 10/10<br/><br/>Be mindful that this is a deliberately slow paced thriller along the lines of se7en and Silence of the Lambs. But the pace and suspense picks up half way through the season.<br/><br/>Season 2 should have been renamed True Defective. Miss at all costs. Totally confused script and awful acting. I scored this season 1/10 for the few moments that it showed promise. Absolutely horrendous ending in terms of script writing and anti-climatic sensations. I really have to ask myself though, whether this season was created just to troll us poor viewers.<br/><br/>How did this series go so wrong?! Yes! There was a lot going on. That seems to be the biggest complaint people have about Season 2 of True Detective. Yes, there are a lot of people involved. Yes, you have to THINK to keep up with the twisted plot. When did that become a negative? My only complaint about the series is that my favorite people didn't make it out alive, and that they died because they cared about someone other than themselves. But that isn't a negative for the show either. Not everything needs a happy ending. None of us make it out alive, and few of us do as much to try to make the world better, or care as much about the world as the characters of this show. I'm hoping for a season 3, and I'm hoping it's not made simple for the critics. When I heard the title True Detective, I thought it would be inspired by the old pulp magazines. But this is pretty much the opposite in every way of those. Forget quick witted tough guys; this is a show of endless talking between two humorless homicide cops. Every conversation is slow and serious, with long pauses. After 20 minutes I started my video player at double speed, and at that speed people talk about as fast as they do in The Maltese Falcon. Based on the first episode, which is as much as I could take, this is less about crime and more about two guys who don't like each other having long, frustrated conversations. Plus the look at me acting Matthew McConaughey seems to be screaming in every scene. So excruciatingly tedious. The producers have seen the success of the Scandinavian dramas and want a slice. However they've forgotten to have an interesting plot that moves along keeping the viewers interested. What a great finale! This has got to be one of the best television series I have ever seen. The acting, writing and directing were all supreme.The word is however the next season of HBO's "True Detective" brings different characters from another part of the country. Too bad. The finale of this first season was written much better than the grand-finale of the highly-proclaimed "Dexter" TV series over at Showtime. What a let down. Head writer of "Dexter," Scott Buck, could learn a thing or two from these new writers at HBO. Season 1 of "True Detective" was exceptionally well-written and a thrill to watch from start to finish. At first I just watch the pilot, because of the great cast and got curious, but this is by far one of the best shows made, and definitely the best show of the 2014.<br/><br/>Strongly centered on the characters, Matthew Mcconaughey is simply amazing in one of the roles of his life for sure, and Woody Harrelson as a strong and intense partner, surrounded by a great picture of the interior of America, and all wrapped up in a dark and mysterious vibe.<br/><br/>It keeps you glued to the screen, and the end it leaves you with the urge of more and more.<br/><br/>Real nice job so far HBO. A must see. I am not one who normally watches television, but this show grabbed me from minute one. This show has all of the strong qualities of cinema, but it's formatted for episodes. Which is one of the reasons why this show is so addicting. You are always wanting more, and they keep you hanging on till the next week.<br/><br/>Each character is battling with their own inner demons and although they are completely different in almost every way, they somehow seem very similar. The artistry and and perfection of the scenes/dialogue make this show a 10 in my book. I now have a favorite show. (And it has been quite a while since those words have come from my mouth.) True Detective is an intense, dark, and gripping tale of two Southern detectives and their ever engaging 17 year chase of a sadistic serial killer. It's difficult for a show to be as close to flawless and compelling in nearly every manner as this one is. With intense, complex, and changing characters, played perfectly by an overall outstanding cast led by Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson whose performances keep you entranced and intrigued. The setting fits the story very well and the writing, pacing, and dialogue couldn't be better. By the end of each episode you are left thrilled and satisfied wanting more. HBO has assembled quite the Masterpiece here. If you wish to witness Quality TV at it's best, watch this show. After Breaking bad got over. I was looking to find a good show to watch.Game of thrones was still to come up with new season,but somewhere i found the mention of the show and i thought of seeing it.Boy you are in for a treat.HBO comes again with a masterpiece.First of all the star cast. The 2 detectives Cole and Marty simply rock the show by their superb acting.The script is another thing which show has brought in.The complexity about plot and characters is great.The direction and screenplay of the show is great too.HBO has given some of the best shows but this one surely top of the list.The show never bores you and keeps you edge of the seat.<br/><br/>A must watch I am a huge fan of most HBO original series and True Detective ranks right up there with the best. It is also a reason I pay extra for HBO as this show demonstrates the freedom the actors and writers have on a 'Premium Channel'. From the very opening sequence which are always interesting and tell a mini-story themselves, ala, True Blood, Boardwalk Empire, Game of Thrones, I knew I was in for a treat. Plus it is so refreshing to see two 'A' List, OK maybe Woody is A-, actors bring so much complexity and understated elegance to their characters, I cannot wait for Episode 2. Another element of this show which truly works are all the layers that were uncovered in the first episode but only a slight bit, making me want more and to better understand what is 'really going on'. If viewers tune in expecting a heavy handed action show, at least so far, they will be under whelmed since that was not the stage the writer set for us. All the supporting characters are bringing another level to the narrative most notably the detective's wife, who has both a real sadness yet yearning for life quality that I see playing out as this goes on. It almost feels like the two main characters are asking the same questions we are and I love that. HBO you have done it again and I am eager for more. Not as fast moving as season1,2. Actually its borring i find the story all over the place. This narrative was a total cheat, what a load of who shot John ! Dont waste 8 plus hours of your life on it seriously. Please lets not make any more True Detectives. This confusing red herring mess is deterioration enough already....RIP I'm giving this a 6/10 because of how absolutely horrible every season is besides the first. Season 3 is just a horrible copy cat of season 1, and they only did that because they know how well the executed the first season. Just milking money and upsetting the audience. Should've kept it as a limited series, would've given it a 9/10 if that was the case. First of all, I loved Season 1. Season 2 starts off slow, but lays a necessary foundation for the events ahead. You need the background of characters and past events in order to comprehend the future episodes. A lot of the other reviews for this season are negative, but I don't think those individuals kept watching the show. I've watched it week-to-week, but it might be better for some to watch back-to-back, since most of the episodes have aired. Any show with sex parties, pills, and violence is a hit in my book! I rarely get out my laptop to review anything, but I was so stunned by this past week's episode that I felt compelled to write something. Ignore the negative reviews and WATCH THIS SHOW. Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson simply make this show absolutely magnificent. These two detectives are solving a mysterious murder over a long 17 year case. The way the show captures the dark country side makes it believable that they are in hell. A hell full of nasty fellows that dread across their paths. <br/><br/>Matthew McConaughey... wow, I find his role in this series is better than anything he's ever done. He is incredible nailing everything in his path. He's really outdone himself providing one of the best characters to date.<br/><br/>Woody Harrelson also doing a very fine job himself giving off a tough cop who's out to do his job. <br/><br/>Both of them work really fine together, terrific chemistry. Only 8 episodes that feels like you're watching an entire movie. Even the intro of True Detective is a work of art. Although this show mainly heavily focuses on drama and not to much action. But its okay because Matthew and Woody keep you on your seat. True Detective is definitely worth watching if you're into Crime/Drama. You won't be disappointed. Matthew McConaughey ARE YOU SERIOUS? You've been in movies for over 20 years and it takes an HBO series to extract your raw talent? You choose an HBO drama to showcase your Oscar worthy performance? WTF? When I watched the first episode and where Matthew McConaughey sat at that table to be interviewed by the detectives my jaw dropped! I never knew that this man was so talented. I thought Woody Harrelson would be the star of the show but McConaughey's performance outshines his.<br/><br/>What a great show. It's gritty and dark and realistic. It just keeps you hooked. The only mistake I think the show made was casting Michelle Monaghan as Harrelson's wife. She just doesn't belong on the show. She's too pretty and squeaky clean and just does not look like the mother of 2 that she plays. Besides that the show is PERFECT! How is this shell considered even slightly good? It is the most overrated piece of junk television show I've ever watched in my life. The writer whose name I have thankfully forgotten, is as juvenile as they come. It is an overdrawn dramatic, hipster, bulshit series. And I can't leave the HBO thought this was a good idea. But clearly there are morons all over the place that think this show is above-average?!! Let's put it this way, if I could name a bigger waste of time, I would. But I simply can't compare this to any other show it is that bad. Terrible terrible terrible. The most boring, useless waste of time I've ever encountered. I would rather pluck my toenails out with pliers then watch another episode of this crap. I loved season 1 and 2 but I find season 3 episode 1 too talkative and boring, especially that the acting is very composed and artificial. I am not interested to follow it through I was looking forward to this show since I've first heard of it some months ago. Both actors have done some good work in the past and the premise of the show sounded good. I did not want to read to much about it before watching it, so I really did not know what to expect.<br/><br/>I watched the first episode and started to get that tingly feeling in my belly. That feeling you get as a kid, when you first watched a Superman movie or E.T. This is an adult adventure, which dives deep down into human psyche and really hits you with a very heavy and slow hammer. The acting is superb, the way the show shifts in time and you get to see the different side of things is addictive as hell. And the direction of this show is above all other TV-shows I have ever watched. It's a mix of Scorsese, Fincher and Coppola with different way of filming scenes. The shootout scene, which seems to be a one take is one for the history books.<br/><br/>I've seen the first 6 episodes two times in a week and I'm in big s**t when it comes to get my mind of this show. I have started researching some of the old material this show references to, and hopefully the last two episodes will give us all a welcome closure to this mystery.<br/><br/>I can not find any really big flaws in this show. For some, it may be a bit slow, but I think we will be rewarded at the end, and I cannot think I have experienced this feeling when watching a TV-show or a movie since I was a kid. This is what it's all about folks. A show that twist and turns and make you really wonder what is going on.<br/><br/>Hopefully the following seasons will live up to this one. I have a feeling that this is by far the best show that 2014 is going to get. Amazing cast, writing, acting, brilliant storyline for the show. Things got really interesting after episode 4, i give this show a perfect 10. <br/><br/>Anyone who has not seen it, needs to watch episode 1 and you will be hooked. Best show since breaking bad ( my opinion ) <br/><br/>I hope this show gets picked for a 2nd season. As of right now its a min series ( 8 episodes ) Curious to see what 2nd season would bring if it does get picked up. This show came out of no where and i am glad it did. Hope it sticks around for a few seasons. <br/><br/>3 more episodes left to go. <br/><br/>Enjoy ! Check out my blog- http://televisionreligion.blogspot.com/ HBO's latest series, True Detectives, slips comfortably into the network's reputation for quality. This is going to be an anthology series where each season is a self-contained story, with different actors, which frees up movie stars like Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson to show their talents in a different medium other than the big screen while not committing to a time consuming series. Within the first three minutes the chemistry between them becomes infectious, or perhaps I should say addictive, and their charisma allows some of the faults in the show to be smoothed over. As soon as you see them together, you wonder how the hell this pairing hasn't come about before. McConaughey as the ubiquitous genius Rust Cohle who has the ability to empathize with serial killers because of how close his thought process mirrors his prey is supremely effective. Harrelson has the harder role in Martin Hart, as the straight man always does, as the good old boy self-described "regular type dude". The plot is terribly familiar territory, a ritualistic serial killer stalking young women and the flawed men investigating the murders while going about their flawed lives. There's some Fargo, some Seven, some Hannibal, some of The Killing (which the writer/creator penned a few episodes of)- it seems a bit of every sort of procedural cop story, and just because you have all the ingredients of a cheesecake doesn't mean you have a good one once it comes out of the oven. Yet as more is revealed as to why these very human men are angst ridden and dialogue that borders on philosophy comes to the forefront it becomes less formulaic. The main story is told in flashbacks by the characters while being interviewed, or perhaps interrogated, by fellow law enforcement. The non-linear story line is not just a gimmick, what we get to see in the present day interview rooms is the toll the last 18 years have taken on these men, which whets our appetite to find out why. The cinematography is moody, but never suffocating. Like a lot of great series, the sense of place in the stifled economy and heat of Louisiana isn't just a setting, it becomes a character in and of itself, although the desolation is sometimes a little hit you over the head. The editing is scrumptious, there's none of that crappy quick jump shots to build suspense, and the camera lingers on the actors after the dialogue is over so that we can drink in the reactions, not just get to the next plot point. I sense a light touch in the direction, mostly allowing for a scene to unfold with real feeling instead of force feeding our sense of these characters, which lets us draw our own conclusions while working things out for ourselves. And that's what I'm liking most about this series so far. Like Breaking Bad the writers are respecting me, not expecting me to only be able to comprehend at a 6th grade level. This is a series that your mind has to actually participate in. With a bit of drug-fueled surrealism and some Cormac McCarthy like dialogue (mostly from McConaughey) on how the human race is a natural mistake or tapping into universal truths that doesn't actually come out of people's mouths in real life but none the less trips on the ear and tickles your brain pan this isn't going to be up everybody's alley. I've only spent a few hours with these characters and I am feeling a bit emotionally unvested, but I am going to continue to watch. I seem to be missing out on what others are raving about. The show had a glint of initial promise, but now having watched the entire first season it can be summarised as disappointing to say the least.<br/><br/>It opens in a dark, gloomy and mysterious background of Louisiana. That and the cast is quite possibly the only good points of the show. The story takes a very long time to develop, with little action and some signs of great dialogue and cinematography, but over-rided by the horrific writing.<br/><br/>The ending of the season was just terrible, incomparable to the legendary ending of breaking bad for example which it seems to attempt to replicate. The story never seems to develop smoothly, at times your heart is racing and you too join Rust and Marty in the suspense but for most of the series you're listening to a boring drone of dialogue. There was really no plot-twist or surprise or anything which actually made you sit and think. Attempting to hint at subliminal points and hidden messages but in actuality coming across as cheesy and just plain infuriating.<br/><br/>The most undeserved score I have probably ever seen on IMDb. You have got to be kidding me with a 9.5 rating, the score needs to be lowered. I mean 2nd best TV show of all time? Are you actually insane, people?<br/><br/>People are too quick to judge and class this as the "new Breaking Bad" when the basic essence of the show, the writing, is just lacking that special something. Over-rated in my opinion... I am a big fan of drama movie,especially detective.However,the only detective serial movie that impressed me the most is Sherlock Holmes.I mean I have seen a lot of "chasing murder" movies but none of them can gave me strong feeling like Sherlock Holmes serial.Until I saw True Detective,I must say it just completely breathtaking.I feel like this is the way a detective is suppose to chasing a dangerous murder,I do not say Sherlock Holmes method catching criminal is unrealistic but I don't think there are not many people can have a brilliant mind like Sherlock.In addition,I feel that the movie purpose are not only want to entertain the audience,they also want people to have a closer look at a detective life,what they have to sacrifice for their career which is the job that protect civilian from some psycho killers.In conclude,I strongly recommend if someone have not seen it,just wait until it broadcasts the whole season 1 cause waiting is sick and I hate it. This show is one of the best series that has come out of TV in a long time. I have to give it to Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson for taking the characters and giving such wonderful performances. The shows premise is unique for a police story and the direction it takes the audience is one of intrigue and excitement. There is no way to guess which way the story will go because the story is mesmerizing. Be sure to tune in and you will definitely enjoy it. Look out award shows; this is the new "Breaking Bad". It will be hard to top this for 2014 shows,I just love it. Once you watch this show, you will definitely look at TV with a better perspective. Definitely a 10 over 10! Superb just Superb! I just watched season 3 episode 1and 2 and wanting the rest episodes right now! But I have to wait for those week after week..I can say After season 2 made the show a little bit down season 3 came with a bang and making season 1 proud.. I just watched S3 Ep1 and.....it is spellbinding.
Finally a worthy successor to season one's magnificence. 15 minutes into the the first episode my only thought was - this is an instant classic. Now, several episodes later, I can only say this show is an absolute masterpiece of cinematography. The constant feeling of dread, despair and darkness is enveloping. You just can't look away from the screen. There's nothing bloody on the screen, there's no gore or the usual TV visual gratification, yet you can't shake that uneasy feeling in your stomach. It's one of those programs that take you on an emotional roller coaster with each and every episode and leave you desperate for more. It's also a great example as to why many directors are switching from film to TV. The contemporary TV format is allowing for a much more layered story telling.<br/><br/>The dialogs and camera work have been taken beyond perfection, and both Harellson and McConaughey deliver amazing performances. McConaughey is especially fascinating to watch as the storyline keeps switching from past to present. Overall, this is one for the books. A must watch for any serious TV aficionado! 10/10, up there with the likes of The Wire, Oz, Twin Peaks and The Killing. I don't write many reviews. I feel compelled to warn others before they waste their time with S3. I wanted to like it and high hopes. It was slow, speech was often difficult to understand and it was very predictable. I did like the attempt to connect the story to S1, but that occurred over about 5 minutes of the entire show. The makeup and acting of the lead characters while they were old was pretty good. If there is a S4 I will wait for the reviews before I decide to watch it. Decent albeit very slow beginning to S3. The atmosphere is dense (similar to S1) and after E4 I'm still hooked, if also for the hope that the pace will eventually pick up.<br/><br/>Extremely annoying: the mumbling of the lead actor. Seriously, it sounds at times like he's recovering from tongue surgery. I have watched the entire Season at least 30 times since it finished and it still never gets old. Matthew McConaughey should be nominated and win for every award possible for his acting as Rustin Cohle. These 2 (McConaughey and Harrelson) complimented each other better than biscuits and gravy. Easily the greatest character in television history as well. I still continue to notice small details here and there every time I watch it. The entire cast performed well and I honestly can't think of anything that would have made this season better or anything that was bad. This one is definitely going down in history. I wished I could give it more than 10 stars. true detective is my new favorite TV show. an eight-hour movie that will blow your mind like never before. Simply amazing the masterpiece that Nic Pizzolatto has created with the incredible duo of powerful acting by matthew mcconaughey and woody harrelson. True detective has an disturbing atmosphere full of mystery and a little bit of the cosmic horror from H.P lovecraft novels which make it an original series like no one other. This is a 'must watch' to everyone who saw breaking bad because it feels like we have a new king around us. the quotes from Rust Cohle will be legendary in a few years and remembered as a classic TV show character. True detective is the best TV show of 2014. A breathtaking, nail biting, cold sweating series which nails the description "Amazing series". Matthew McConaughey (Detective Rust Cohle) is starring an intellectual narcissist who always succeeds in annoying his surrounding, especially his partner Woody Harrelson (Detective Marty Hart). These two detectives are trying to solve a case involving possible serial killers, pedophiles and some voodoo activity. <br/><br/>The quality of this series is astonishing, the characters are marvelous and the acting is brilliant. Together with a very well written script and brilliant acting performances this has to be one of the best series I have ever watched. It reminds me a bit of Dexter (Showtime), very dark and most of the time it makes you feel sick to your stomach but your curiosity keeps you chained to the show. You can also feel how the characters develops further into the series and as the series advances you start to relate to them and develop with them.<br/><br/>I would recommend everyone to watch this series, I think it is a very good way to gain another perspective and experience. It really makes you watch the "past-noon-series" from a different angle. However, brilliant, simply brilliant. I've watched this series a few days earlier & no series made a impact on my thoughts before like this one. I consider myself to be very lucky that I could see this beautiful cinematography and acting merging together to form a masterpiece(not to mention the storyline). Matthew Mcconaughey played the role of an ex-rogue cop Cohle(Rust) who's the main focus of this series.Matthew Mcconaughey did set a limit. A limit that I guess won't be reached by other actors that easily.The character Marty played by Woody Harrelson did go well together as everyone in this crew tried their best to give the best. & I should add an extra line to just thank the director Cary Fukunaga. I haven't seen anything like this since Sin City. Editings, shots kept my eyes on that screen without even blinking. Just some final words. Don't watch this while you are depressed or anything. The dark dialogues of Cohle(Rust) will eat you up for good.The conclusion of this review is you won't regret a bit watching this series. Just don't get depressed..seriously!! I'm not normally a fan of procedural cop drama but there was so much buzz around this one I had to take a look. The first episode took a bit of effort for me and it was episode two that really pulled me in. Episode 2 to 5 are for me, the best TV I have ever seen. Maybe my expectations were riding too high after the stunning climax of episode four, where Rusty takes part in the stash house robbery. It was just an absolutely amazing, riveting, thrilling drama of the highest caliber. Episodes 6,7 and 8. I don't know, it was still great, kept me interested, and had a few really special moments but it just wasn't quite as powerful.<br/><br/>I've given it an eight for the stunning early episodes but I have to be honest and say the conclusion was a bit of a let down. I agree with many of you guys that the intro song is awesome. However, I watched until episode 3 and what I saw at the end just made me realize how bad this series actually is. I thought it was totally ridiculous how: SPOILER ALARM<br/><br/>At the end of episode 3 the detectives seem to tell the story of how they got close to the serial killer. One of the detective explains how he realized the pain and torture that the victims went through just before they were killed. He goes on to explain how he realized that the victims must have felt relieved to die or to let go. (**Here comes the cheesy part, which made me realize how bad this series actually is**)... As the detective explains away his theories about life and death and how the victims must have felt, he mentions that the victims also had dreams about being a person. Then the detective says: But as in a lot of dreams, there is a monster waiting at the end of it. <br/><br/>At the moment as he says that, the camera wanders off to a field, stroking a small hill of grass. There seems to be the killer at a far distance and the camera starts zooming in on the killer slightly as he walks across the view. (**It is totally stupid how he is dressed and the music that is playing**) OMG this series is so cheesy and ridiculous. <br/><br/>Don't waste your times<br/><br/>Thanks Contains spoilers!!<br/><br/>I can handle sex and nudity as well as anyone else. But, when it's so blatantly gratuitous, one-sided and dehumanizing...it's insulting to both men and women. I can't believe the viewers and critics that are gushing over this show. I have a hard time being captivated by the actual (thin) plot because I'm slapped in the face with women's backsides everywhere...the wife, the girlfriend, the strip clubs, the young, former prostitute (who begs for anal sex), the victim, the opening credits...(fetish anyone?) The decor of women's backsides in the opening credits, sitting into spikes on her high heels just serves no purpose but to...what? This show uses real world issues (victimization of women, murder, sex crimes, prostitution) to prop up the main characters' machismo. I care more about the victims than the director, writer and producers do. This is irresponsible and indulgent storytelling. And Nic would do better if he just wrote porn, or he just chose not to write female characters at all and stuck with male characterization-which he is good at. True Detectives choreography is different than most traditional television shows. To be honest we need this kind of creativity in the television department, television is getting WAY too clichÃ© these days. So here, we have true detective. A mix of a narrative and a period drama. So far its been alright, to say the most episode one did not have me yet. I enjoyed episode two knowing the characters and their lives, made me more interested. We need more this creative TV and I'm glad to see it here, especially with Woody and Matthew. There's some hope for the television drama and this is a sign. Disappointed its a 8 episode series, but I think it will be worth our time watching in the long run. Season 1 was great.
Season 2 was garbage.
Season 3 is just boring.
I can't understand the fantastic ratings here. The first two episodes of series 3 is so boring that my watch stopped. Actors in sleep mode. It's as if everyone was told: "Try to sleep walk through your role, and everyone will love it". Well... I don't. True Detective is not your usual detective series at all. It's a much more mature subject and serious theme. It's about human nature, corruption, violence, love and a lot more. The whole series is very dark and well made.<br/><br/>Season 1:<br/><br/>The plot is wonderful and although it can be very slow for some people when it comes it hits your right into the heart. The theme is very dark, the darkest theme you could ever make a series about. The acting is brilliant with no contest at all, it's not just Woody and Matthew but Michelle Monagham who give us a perfect performance. A real joy to watch. The soundtracks are incredible good and the way all this is filmed is just a great achievement of this great director (Nic Pizzolatto).<br/><br/>Season 2: <br/><br/>For some reason, people in general didn't liked this season. I REALLY don't know why. First of all, the plot is really good, and if you pay enough attention you can follow it very well. I wanna talk about this girl....Lera Lynn.....it's the girl who sings the entire soundtrack, she is the girl in the bar, with her sad and softly voice, a real joy to listen to, just incredible work with the soundtrack and an amazing choice. The director still the same (Nic Pizzolatto) and you can fell at every take of this series, still the same geniality, the same quality, a real great work. About the acting....dear lord....Colin Farrel and Vince Vaughn they really delivered the performances of their carriers. And you have together with this Rachel MacAdams and Kelly Reilly. Just incredible cast, if you compare to the first season you lose nothing in terms of quality of cast. The enjoyment was amazing in both seasons, the performances, soundtracks (better in the second), plots, themes, development of character and story, direction, and dialogs....everything you have in both seasons. The only thing I give for those who love the first season and hate the second is that the theme of the first is really heavy compared to the second. But please, think for a second... This is all about human nature....human behavior and with that Pizzolatto made a master piece of art, a beautiful work, something to be really proud of. My first review...sorry if it's bad. When I first sat down to watch this series, I was surprised with the way it was building itself, and the way the plot was layed out. It was a bit more complicated than others, and it demanded a lot from its viewers, but once you surrendered to it, you couldn't look away. <br/><br/>Already by the second episode I was pretty much hooked to this show, and the two main characters' story was just so mysteriously interesting that I couldn't stop watching. I loved how the show chose to focus on the characters and their story, and then use a secondary 'detective plot' as the driven force. It worked seemingly. Because that is what may confuse some - The 'main story' really isn't the main story - it is the story about the characters and the themes that are. <br/><br/>Overall it is easy to see and enjoy all the amazing talent behind and in front of the camera. It really is a pleasure to enjoy this series, right from the very beginning to the end. I pray for a 2nd season already. This season really set the standard in almost every relevant aspect of how TV series entertainment has to be. Starting with the intro song that pulls viewers in from minute one. The narration, the visual look, the music, the story itself are all state-of-the-art. Not to forget the two main actors. Woody Harrelson and even more: Matthew McConaughey (that said not being a big fan of his former work). What McConaughey delivers from an acting point of view is simply amazing. Emmy/ Golden Globe anyone? There's only one thing that saddens me in this review. Even if it's more or less clear that a Season 2 (read the rumors) won't have anything to do with Season 1 - a fact that is more or less obvious after watching Season 1 by the way - it's hard to imagine how they will keep the same level of quality for Season 2. Nonetheless, this was the one and only TV series that really kicked Breaking Bad from the throne (it's only nuances and you can't compare eggs with butter, true, but I've never seen something that was composed so flawless and left me speechless after each episode. And even left me speechless after the ending credits in the season finale. Chapeau Nic Pizzolatto! in my opinion true detective is the next great series after Breaking Bad, everyone says how Breaking Bad is the best show of all time, ill agree its one of the best but not the best, this show if it keeps going this way could be one of those shows to remember. why because true detective is brilliantly shot, edited, the scenes create a sinister and disturbing feeling to it. the characters are amazing especially Mathew macaughney. the series is brilliantly written. the beginning of the series is also brilliantly set up. the camera angles and music is brilliant. overall I have not seen a series like this before, a time of disturbing mystery crime thriller. overall I have to give it a 10 out of 10 words cannot explain how good this is ON 'TRUE DETECTIVE' AND OTHER LOVE STORIES<br/><br/>By Greg Joseph<br/><br/>THE GREAT DIRECTOR FRANK CAPRA ("It's A Wonderful Life") was holding court at the Hotel del Coronado near San Diego in the mid-1980s, "reuniting" with Dr. Seuss, Theodor Geisel, with whom he had worked on propaganda films for the Army during World War II. At one point, Capra, whom I had profiled a decade or so earlier after the release of his memoir, "The Name Above the Title," talked about what makes films work. He was specifically referring to Steven Spielberg's "E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial," the science fiction film that was one of that era's mega-hits. "It works and is such a hit with the audiences because it's a love story _ a love story between the boy and the alien." In other words, it made audiences care. For me, no matter what genre I'm watching, I need to care. Which brings me to HBO's "True Detective," starring Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson as mismatched homicide detectives investigating serial murders committed over a 17-year span in Louisiana's bayou country. The series, whose last episode of the first season premiered on Sunday (3/9/2014), attracted me more than anything because of the relationship between the two detectives. In a fine review in The New York Times, Alessandra Stanley observes: "Behind all the Spanish moss and ontological mystique that the show's creator, Nic Pizzolatto, brought to the script, the eight-part series focused on the on-again, off-again bromance of Marty Hart (Woody Harrelson) and Rust Cohle (Matthew McConaughey)." As Stanley pointed out, many viewers loved the series for its rich texture and decadence, while others faulted the series for not fully tying up loose ends. I would posit that we all somewhat missed the point, for beneath it all was this all-important relationship. As Stanley noted, "The show is called 'True Detective,' but at the end it was true love that prevailed." This is exactly what Frank Capra was talking about. But instead of a boy and an alien, we're talking about two human beings who are alien to each other. In the end, they care deeply about each other _ and as a result, we care about them. Most of us didn't like Season 2, but at least it was unconventional storytelling and often weird enough to deep us interested. In Season 3 we have excellent acting from Ali, Dorff and McNairy in particular, but the season is a routine mystery dragged out over eight episodes with a feature-length finale. The tempo of the whole season is typically very slow and contemplative, with many scenes of long pauses between lines of dialog, often going nowhere to further the drama. This could have been a good 2 or 3-episode series. As a huge fan of true detective, the first season will always remain as the best season in any tv show for me, and although it was highly criticized, I liked the second season either. But not like this man.. Do not do it to this show. Third season starting with a mysterious death and ending with a boy hitting his head to a rock? Is that a joke or what? Then why did you create a ritual-like scene at the beginning? For their whole life, 2 detectives, trying to solve a case which is that simple, and it turns out that everyone around them knew what happened, whoever they questioned knew what happened,but they could not observe or figure out this? I am so upset and highly disappointed. I have been waiting for a new season for too long; now I beg of you: do not start a new season ever again-let it remain as a legend. Feels different each season. Talking about season 3. It lacks the mysticism and mystery and progression of season 1. Plot is moving forward very slowly. Season 1 had those focal points - like a new body here, a new clue here. Theres only one body in season 3. The only clue that got my attention so far was the letter. Apart from that they start the investigative line and then drop it for no reason. Still good though, could be better. The show explains itself!! Absolutely amazing everyone should have this in their watch list!! The first True Detective was great. For me it started slow however it rivaled any action movie in the final episodes. The second True Detective was even better than the first IMHO. I haven't written an IMDB in years but I had to give my 2 cents after reading yet another article claiming the second season was so bad that it almost killed the franchise. If you haven't seen either of these limited series, do yourself a favor and check them out. It's edge of your seat action and the plot twists are so exciting but not confusing. True Detective 1 built up to a shocking conclusion that was so good- there are no words to describe it. In True Detective 2, the acting was off the hoo from beginning to end.. Each episode ended with a suspenseful twist so I could hardly wait for the next one to air. The cinematography was better than a lot of feature films. I'm excited that True Detective 3 is here. Long live the franchise! This is what good television is about. As the third season of 'True Detective' is about to start, I have been trying to get in sync (although that is not mandatory, as the stories in each season are independent) with the first two seasons. I discovered a real gem in this first season created by Nic Pizzolatto, produced by Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson with the two wonderful actors playing the principal roles. The quality of this series matches in my opinion the top quality successes in the history of HBO like 'The Wire'.<br/><br/>About half of the eight episodes of the season describe the interviews taken around 2012 by police to two ex-cops that were investigating a series of crimes started in 1995 which looked like abductions followed by strange and abject ritual murders of young women and even kids and teenagers. The crimes and investigations happen in the state of Louisiana, the deep South of the United States, impacted by poverty and crime, and often struck by hurricanes, in a landscape of infinite marshes and under a burning sun. Each of the two homicide detectives Rustin "Rust" Cole (McConaughey) and Martin "Marty" Hart (Harrelson) fights his own daemons. Cole is a lonely man whose marriage did not survive the accidental death of his two years girl, Hart is cheating on his wife and his own marriage is disintegrating. Story telling is non-linear and smart, we see the two characters at different moments in time - 1995, 2002 (when a second wave of crimes is taking place), 2012, and we discover their personalities, courage and persistence, friendship and vices, as the action advances. The pace changes in the last four episode, as the two cops go underground in order to follow the threads that lead to religious organizations and highly positioned families. Their personal crisis deepen, so does their personal involvement, with solving the series of crimes becoming the goal of their lives but also a threat of personal destruction. The final episode is one of the best finale that I have ever seen on TV series, although personally I could have renounced to the cheesy last ten minutes.<br/><br/>The story is compelling and keeps the viewers permanently on the edge both in what concerns the crime intrigue as well as the fate of the two characters. Both McConaughey and Harrelson are wonderful in acting their characters at the three moments in time when the action happens. Michelle Monaghan adds beauty and warmth in the supporting role of Marty's wife. The production is careful to the last of details in describing the subtle changes that their world goes through together with the whole America that they symbolize between the 1995, 2002 and 2012. Setting is amazing using the natural landscape of Louisiana and constructing thrilling environments for the horror sites. The first season of 'True Detective' is definitely one of these productions that prove that TV can be art, and it has good chances to satisfy and more the fans of horror, detective stories and plain good TV dramas. three episodes in to season two... its awful ..what a shame... just the worst... a waste of time truly... I'm sure the actors were dying the writing is worse than CSI junk its not the characters... the plot is so not worth keeping up with that you want to shoot yourself.<br/><br/>Vince Vaughn??? thug? mobster?? leg breaker?? really?? its just stupid who gives a heck about white collar crime in a miniseries??? dumbest idea ever some guys hid some money in a web of paperwork? wow!! that s<br/><br/>new... and scary.... glad i checked in for that.... the first season was a beauty..this is just worthless.... for some reason it keeps telling me i need more lines for some reason it keep s telling me i need more lines for some reason it keeps telling me i need more lines My husband and I were so excited to watch season 2 after enjoying season 1 so much. It seems after every episode of season 2, we looked at each other and said, "huh?" I felt this was a classic case where the first season was so successful that on subsequent seasons the writers feel they have freedom to indulge in unlimited creativity. There were FAR too many characters. The mystery went beyond mysterious to incomprehensible. I did enjoy Vince Vaughn's and Colin Farrell's characters and cared what happened to them.<br/><br/>If you haven't yet seen season 2, which I don't recommend, I advise watching as many episodes at a time as possible and taking notes. Otherwise, the plot moves at a snail's pace and you'll be saying "who?" about a character you barely noticed who resurfaces several episodes later. This isn't bad for a 2 hour movie. Not enough material here for an 8 episode TV season. This suffers badly from a lack of editing. This show also suffers from excessive character development that does not contribute to the viewer understanding or appreciation of the story. Not sure why they went the narrative / b roll method, but I think it could and would work well if this were a 2 hour movie. Think "No Country for Old Men." With the excruciating inclusion of every pointless detail of the characters' lives, it seems beyond unnecessary. If you have a lot of time on your hands, you may want to watch this. For me episodes went by where I felt like nothing much happened and could have been edited out with relevant elements added to other episodes. Haven't watched Season 2 yet. Hoping its better. What a conundrum: True Detective showed TV crime drama at its superlative best and then, within two episodes, reverted to the kind of conventional happy ending dreck we all thought had been given the boot when HBO and other subscription – and ad-free channels – saw off the that kind of rubbish. Why, why, why?<br/><br/>The first six episodes are quite simple excellent. Character came to the fore, the dialogue sounded like the way real people speak to each other. Then, God knows why – was it some HBO executive who felt it had all got too dark and weighed in to dictate the usual 'let's all tie this up nicely so folks can sleep at night ending'? – the final two episodes reduced the whole series to just another feelgood piece of cr*p. Lord, what a disappointment.<br/><br/>It was, perhaps, all summed up with the appearance from nowhere of a platoon of cops cars and ambulances when Woody Harrelson and his sidekick rescue one dead boy and another almost dead girl from the hideout of crystal meth producer. This was topped – though topped is really not the right word – by another such deus ex machine arrival of the cops, who had no idea what was going on because mobile/cells couldn't get a signal and the landline was apparently not connected, just in time to whisk our two heroes, both it would seem mortally wounded, to hospital. To be frank the whole conclusion and the disappointment of it all precludes even bothering to discuss the very real dilemma faced by 'our two heroes', viz an apparent network of corruption extending to the very top.<br/><br/>By all mean give this a whirl if you are reading this review before watching the series, but be full prepared for punches – inexplicably it has to be said – to be pulled for no good reason I can think of. What deserves an 8/9 is thus reduced to a 6/7. This is definitely one of the better TV shows I've seen in a while, but it's not perfect. Basically, it's about two deeply flawed detectives trying to solve a murder. It also deals with their personal lives. This is not an action-based police procedural like CSI or Criminal Minds. It's more like an Agatha Christie novel--slow and talky. Fortunately, that's a style I enjoy greatly.<br/><br/>The show peels away the layers of the mystery slowly. Details that seem unimportant at the beginning become crucial later on. There are hints at a conspiracy of "rich people" who engage in devil worship. Some questions are left unanswered and that's how it should be.<br/><br/>The show has high production values. The photography is beautiful, cinematic in quality. Harrelson and McConaughey both give excellent performances.<br/><br/>At times, though, it seems a little pretentious. Cohle gives a few too many philosophical lectures. In the end, under the shiny exterior, it's your typical dedicated-detectives-solve-a-murder-everyone-else-missed plot. We've seen this before on other shows, but the way it's presented here was refreshing.<br/><br/>Personally, I felt the last episode was a letdown. First, they pretty obviously teased the identity of the killer at the end of the seventh episode. Second, the confrontation with said killer was a little cliché, with the typical searching through dark corridors while being taunted by the villain. Third, the climax was badly misplaced; the killer is caught about halfway through and the rest of the episode consists mainly of Cohle bitching and complaining about how much life sucks. The Cast, the acting, Camera work , scripts and everything else on this magnificent production spells out one word for you : - Superb -<br/><br/>-- It might contain Spoilers ahead -<br/><br/>It gets you through every day life struggles, giving you a very vivid depictions of South Louisiana life. All the while maintaining level of thrill with serial killing cases. Through its characters, you get a glimpse of striking differences of the lives of people ,showcased in law enforcement by rust and Marty. You might compare it with 'Seven' movie but it lacks the action oriented story telling, of which I'm glad. Also Story telling mixes different time lines up to a point and this is my favorite story telling technique. Towards the climax all of the threads of the story got bound in nicely and we got a fairly nice conclusion which tells you in the end, you can't solve it all and can't get justice for all. This is one of the best shows I have ever seen. The amazing story is told in a very dark way which makes it extra exiting. The acting of matthew mcconaughey and woody harrelson is amazing. "True detective" has everything a good show needs to have(action, mystery, sex, drama,...).<br/><br/>If you start this show, you want to see everything. I can't wait for season 2. But this will be with different actors unfortunately. But if they can tell a crime story in the same dark and mysterious way I will certainly watch it.<br/><br/>For me, True detective gets a 10/10. I'm addicted to series, especially to crime series. I know every Sherlock, every Criminal Minds, every single one of them. But none has ever been this good. True Detective is the best series I saw in years.<br/><br/>If I could give a 100 out of 10; I would give 200. Thanks for this one. It's breathe-taking.<br/><br/>I'm patiently waiting for the next season. I hope they beat themselves again, then I'd give a 300. Please HBO.<br/><br/>True Detective has one story, captivating from beginning until the very last minute. With all its branches, tangled into other stories, it never fades. You're always curious what will happen next. Next to that it's the friendship, the link to a normal life, that keeps it scores so high. It feels so familiar, but on the other hand you really don't want it to be familiar. O how I loved this series. I had not heard of this show until the latest Emmy awards, but seeing it was nominated for many major titles, I gave it a go. The first episode completely hooks you in, and keeps you wanting more. Every episode is a brilliant masterpiece. The plot is rich, dark and very intriguing. Not a single dull moment. If you're the type of person that likes dark, intriguing and thriller-type shows and movies, this one is for you. The Woody Harlesson - Matthew Mccnaughey duo is absolutely splendid. They have such chemistry together which makes it a delight to watch.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this one to anyone that likes this darker genre. My only concern with the show is the fact that every season will feature a different set of actors, setting, etc. The first season's duo was top-notch: we'll have to see if the second round of actors will be able to keep the bar as high! These days every other show on television is a crime solving genre...this is making the television truly an idiot box ..Amongst this wreckage and utter clichés comes as a savior TRUE DETECTIVE..matthew mcconaughey as the eccentric and brilliant detective "RUST" steals the show with his terrific screen presence and ably assisted by "Marty" who throws in a riveting performance in every shot mesmerize the audience...All the credit for the director "Cary Joji Fukunaga" for boldly bringing in a multiple time line storytelling genre to TV...A whiff of fresh air and a show which you just cant stop promoting yourself !! Another great performance of M. McC., Which seems to have solved the flip Oscar contender (maybe draws in C. Bale), and well assisted by W. Harrelson and others. The series promises a lot, both for the quality of production, direction and acting, as the unusual approach and an almost European progress, avoiding the common American form for this kind of series. The script is very well concatenated, and the steering is very precise, valuing performance casting and producing scenes of well developed action. I would say that is the same level as "The Killing" (perhaps better - time will tell) and better than "The Bridge" (which is already good). Watch this show. <br/><br/>This is not a crime TV show, it is all about the characters and who they really are. The case is in the background being slowly solved. The show is never predictable or cliché. The ending is great. I'm not sure if they even completely clear up everything in the case, which would usually bother me but in this instance makes it seem more genuine that there are parts left unknown. This is definitely a series with repeat value, you can re-watch and notice something different each time. Everything in this series clicks together perfectly. Every actor in this series does a fantastic job, especially Matthew McConaughey. <br/><br/>Slightly suspicious of Season 2 being made.... Only two episodes in, yet I still have to review this. I can not recommend it enough! <br/><br/>The main characters are truly amazing. The actors really stand out and the characters they portray really make the series! My personal favorite is Matthews role due to his view on things making him a very neat contrast. These two really paint a good picture together, capturing how different humans can be. <br/><br/>Coupled with this, we are presented with a "then and now" frame, where a story is slowly emerging in the best way possible. This is story telling like you've never heard it! Watch it! True Detective written by Nic Pizzolatto comes with an interesting cast. Academy Nominated actor Matthew McConaughey and two times Academy nominated Woody Harrelson. Nothing could go wrong, so I thought. But almost everything went wrong. The opening has so much borrowed from David Lynch's Twin Peaks and is so much trying to impress with presenting these 'odd' talking characters, and cinematography which is good I admit, that this opening episode, so far that is, tries desperately to impress the viewer as a none conformist approach from the director. As if the series tries to be some kind of European Art House production. It's fails doing so, simply because it tries to hard to look as if everything has a meaning, a hidden dark storyline or some interesting dialogues while in practice the main characters remain shallow and quite frankly very boring. The main problem, one that affecting American productions, is that there is such a wide gap between the main characters and the other actors, good looking detectives with shiny white teeth and intelligent versus the almost weird color graded scenery of the impressive looking landscapes with it's surreal acting extra's. This is all done in an attempt to impress the viewer but fails for reasons mentioned above.<br/><br/>True Detective tries to be unique, but leans to much on clichés. I can only hope the TV- series will develop in a good way, but episode one didn't empress me at all. <br/><br/>3/10 Season 3<br/><br/>Starts off as a detective story.<br/><br/>Eventually all the episodes are fillers.
Show, so long, u even see the main actors get old and age..
Now that is slow .<br/><br/>It would great a good movie around 2,15 minutes. It should be,
but the plot in itself aint a big a mystery. Its just they way it layed out, it gives many possebillities. So its not like, its more like, whatever that happened. But when u wait 7 episodes for something. It becomes a wow, finaly. God damn, no stop it . Finish this is, quick please... Its really the best try i gave to desribe this...<br/><br/>If u dont have patience, this will train it for you, help u get more patience in life. Not always the easiest. Season one: 10/10. My favourite season of all series, although that is a very personal subject. It has a really good plot, acting, music, photography (mainly in the first episodes), and the time passage was very good. Maybe it is a little too dark, mostly characters are emotionally heavy, but they are interesting as the crime story. I watched it maybe three times and every time I became kinda heavy for two or three days, but I still liked it.<br/><br/>Season two: 5/10. I think the creator was a bit lost there. There was some copies from season one, but the worst was the plot, that was very confusing. Maybe there was too much main characters, because I couldn't feel empathy towards the road patrol officer at all. Also, there is unnecessary philosophies there that I think tries to imitate season one, and I felt some cringing or mushy moments there. The season had so potential that wasn't explored and that is frustrating. Also, the first episode seems too long, but only because it feels like a big introducing.<br/><br/>Season three: 7,5/10. Something between season one and two. I felt it wasn't the best the creator could do, maybe it could be better with more working time, but he definitely put more effort there than season two. It isn't dark as season one, but in a good way, because there aren't many repetitions there. The story and the characters are new, intriguing, and the marriage story gives another dimension for the series. The main character is very different from the other seasons in a good way. Bonus for the make-up and acting of everyone. Each Season should have it's own page for review.
S01: 9.5
S02: 9.0
S03: 10<br/><br/>True Detective is one of the greatest series ever made in the history of movie making. S03 was the best of the three, and did not disappoint from beginning to the very end. There was no PC, political agenda, academic pandering, or social themes forced into these series. As a generation X-er, I appreciate this masterpiece that was honest with the characters, no embellishment, or forced narrative to appease certain groups. The script was carefully done not to give anything away, or foreshadow the plot. It was very exciting that the series was not predictable, or that the script gave anything away.<br/><br/>These series are an example of how the movie industry should make movies. This series nailed every emotional complexity about life, our families, our jobs, our relationships, and our decisions in life. These series are for a well seasoned, intelligent, and mature audience, who can appreciate real life and the struggles that follows. It is extremely rare these days to find such quality.<br/><br/>I wish all shows or series was half as good as these are. S03 is the first time I have ever given a show or a series a 10 in all my 50 years of watching movies and TV shows. This masterpiece exemplifies the nature and understanding of true race relations and cultural differences in the workforce and in society. It wasn't contrived, or over done. It offers a rare and honest approach that isn't shown anymore, and is about as real as it gets. I look forward to a S04 with great excitement and enthusiasm. I thank the makers of these series who did not sacrifice their talents for the sake of appeasing the mainstream agenda. True Detective is a brilliant masterpiece! What the f** did you have in mind writing season 2? There's a saying calling emotional rape. That pretty much wraps ups season 2. Rack up some main characters as being likable and reap 'em in the end. What ???? As if they didn't have any other options? This is just p*** poor writing skills on behalf of the writers behind season 2. A third grade could have made a more interesting plot. True Detective is masterfully made. While the detectives first set out to solve a murder it is really issues in their backgrounds and history that they strive to overcome. The intermingling of people's lives and situations overlaps more and more as the story continues. Its fascinating for the most part. I do like that they introduced a female detective this year. Haunted by her own past and trying to do the right thing, she is a welcome relief from all of the male posturing. Rachel McAdams does a great being badass. Its a good story but a bit difficult to follow at times. It does leave one wondering, however, if all real life detectives are tortured souls looking for some sort of redemption. (Three episodes into season 2)<br/><br/>I've read a number of reviews from both professional critics and regular everyday people, I think it's pretty unfair the amount of hate the second season is getting, people tend to forget that season 1 was a slow starter then it all kicked off after a memorable episode just before the midway point.<br/><br/>My point is that people should give this second season time before fully judging it, it's a very complex storyline but if you take the time to fully understand everything, the characters, the setting, what's going on, then I truly believe we're going to be in for a treat in the remaining the five episodes.<br/><br/>As for the characters and acting, I don't think anyone will be able to touch the performance from Matthew McConaughey in the first season, that was acting at its finest. The acting through season 2 has been very impressive in my personal opinion, with all of the cast being superb for setting the mood so far. I feel some of the people watching this second series are being to quick to judge, particularly with Vince Vaughan, as he seems to be getting the majority of the hate. I believe Vince is merely setting up what will be a number of different moods/layers to his character and by the end of the series his performance will turn out to be one of the best.<br/><br/>Remember this is just my personal opinion and everyone has a right to their own, but I think this follow-up season will end up surprising a lot. If the sheer complexity of everything is done right it could potentially be up there with season 1. Gripping, thought provoking, suspenseful and incredibly done are words that come to mind. The first two or three episodes are somewhat slow and I almost gave up on it. Now it wasn't a bad show just taking to long for me to warm up to the rhythm which was a little meandering for me. It's bloomed like a good cigar into rich story telling and wonderful in depth character development.<br/><br/>It even carries a bit of an evil mystical effect with eerie moody visuals and "bad" people left unmolested for decades, who appear to have ingrained into their surroundings a weird kind of acceptance.<br/><br/>I'm almost through the first season and I find myself refraining from chain watching the episodes in one sitting so I've limited myself to one episode per night. Sort of what I did with Lost until Comcast pulled it as I entered the 5th season.<br/><br/>Sit back and enjoy the first few episodes and watch it open up into a gem. True Detective is sublime television programming. If you are at all entertained by crime drama, murder mystery, film noir or Southern Gothic, you will likely be mesmerized by this show. Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson just slam-dunk their roles as reluctant partners on an increasingly winding case in Louisiana. The crime aspects are as disturbing as the real-life atrocities they mirror. And homicide investigations can only ever tear open whatever wounds their pursuers are nursing. You get to follow their home lives, hear personal histories, witness the social underbelly they trudge through and the office politics they have to maneuver. There's comic relief in their banter, deep philosophical introspection and plenty of suspense and action as they risk their lives to get the bad guy. It's content that's familiar to the fan viewer but delivered with powerhouse acting, vivid local color and stirring music that pulls the viewer all the way in. I post few rave reviews because the professionals do it better, but I just had to help spread the word on this one. It's a single-season case so there's no reason to miss out this year or any other. The writer and director might be new to television but what amazing talents; I sincerely hope to see more from them. I rooted for the true detectives with every precarious step, and did not walk away emotionally unaffected. This one stayed with me. Just finished watching it all, one episode after another, in a row, with some occasional sleeping and eating. Now, these days one rarely has a privilege to watch something perfect but this is it. What's perfect about it? Everything. Writing, direction, acting (truly a work of art here), casting, music, editing, cinematography (especially choice of colors), even the duration. You name it. Oh, yes: it is dark. And slow. But it is just as it should be. Such a story so perfectly told you cannot put into a regular movie (or even a two part movie). It had to be a tailored set of episodes for the TV. I'm glad there are people out there who are true artists and not afraid to show it. Extremely recommended. Keep the recording of all episodes someplace and watch it again after a while. It is still hard to believe that this was "only a job" for all the people involved in the production. Bravo! Where should I start? Story, characters, scenes, directors, acting, music. Every single piece is near to perfect about this title.<br/><br/>The story is woven so deeply and gracefully that it attracts you towards itself and you can't stop yourself waiting eagerly for the next episode for the whole week.<br/><br/>The characters and acting is also perfect. Two detectives partner up each other who has completely different characters and you see their conflicts apart from the story but realistic as much as it can be. Matthew was an average actor before Dallas Buyers Club and this show. But now I consider him as one of the best alive.<br/><br/>The director of photography also did a great job. The scenes selected are chosen carefully. The colors are not vivid and completely in harmony with the story and the drama.<br/><br/>And the title music absolutely fits for this drama.<br/><br/>Great show just watch it, you won't regret it. True Detective really delivers here one of the best seasons I've ever seen in any series. The performances are amazing and the dialogs are fantastic, you feel like an addiction to understand every single word coming out Rust's mouth. The relationship between Rust and Marty is well portrayed , because as you're watching you feel like they don't want to be with each other but by the end of the show you see that they deeply in their hearts they care about each other, even Rust's dark heart. <br/><br/>The show is really that high , and honestly when you reach this high and knowing the characters and actors will change for the season 2 I'm afraid that the quality will decrease. I know I'm anxious to see the season 2a<br/><br/>10/10 for season 1 "Once there was only darkness. You ask me, the light's winning." -Rust Cohle.<br/><br/>It was so worth it to wait for the season to finish and watch it in one go. HBO got another winner. <br/><br/>Matthew Mcconaughey and Woody Harrelson, two big Hollywood stars leading this show and delivering absolutely amazing performances. The acting in this show as a whole is some of the best I have ever seen in a series. But to me, Mcconaughey truly stole the show in every scene he was in it. He is just such AN AWESOME actor. The chemistry between these two was great and natural and is clearly one of the main focus of the show. <br/><br/>The story is covered in mystery and haunting atmosphere throughout the series and it is executed masterfully. I just loved it. Lots and lots of tension and eeriness was delivered over the course of 8 episodes. Each episode is an hour long and I honestly couldn't believe how quickly time flew by while watching them. It also helps that the writing in this show is absolutely amazing, one of the best I have seen. Matthew Mcconaughey's character especially is written so well. VERY VERY quotable. <br/><br/>The cinematography in this show is something truly spectacular, probably the best I have ever seen in a series. Such beauty in it. A special shout to the last 6-8 mins of episode 4, it was Hollywood master level stuff there, pure AWESOMENESS. Never seen anything quite like it in a series before.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is another thing this show excels at. The haunting/mysterious score gave the show a supernatural overtone throughout. Hell, at times it felt like I was watching a horror show. <br/><br/>This show is not for everyone BUT at least giving it a try is a MUST. Highly recommended. <br/><br/>One of the best thing I have ever seen on television. Very VERY rarely do I give a show a full rating.<br/><br/>10/10 Quite possibly the best drama series, True Detective's eerie sequences and irresistible cinematic appeal draws you into its mystifying world which questions the temporal logic and makes you witness utterly unspeakable horrors courtesy of a villain who, in my opinion, joins the ranks with the likes of Hannibal Lecter. The fact that two (hands down) exceptional actors, McConaughey and Harrelson, take the lead roles doesn't hurt either.<br/><br/>Rust Cohle, with his enigmatic past and fancy dialogue, quickly turns into a character very difficult to dislike. In fact, his lines are so good that IGN did a "Best of.." article on them.<br/><br/>Marty Hart, meanwhile, is flawed and reactive, but we still see that he has a good heart. His family issues, relationship troubles, humorous responses to Cohle's theories... these all attributes make him an interesting character to follow.<br/><br/>Cary Fukunaga, director of all the eight episodes, does a hell of a job. The past-present-past loop sequences prove entertaining and thoroughly gripping, all the time making us question the "True" side of "True Detective" in an intellectual fashion. Though every episodes is spectacular, for me, Episode 4 (Who Goes There) and Episode 5 (The Secret Phase of All Life) are the stand outs.<br/><br/>All in all, this is the show that you just can't ignore. Go watch it if you haven't already, and witness TV at its finest. It's my first review here and I've pick up that movie for the reason it is the first TV show I was truly addicted to. Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson are exceptional actors and they've proved it one more time.<br/><br/>The director and all the crew did excellent job, as well as the cast.<br/><br/>The story is quite intensive and dark. Since the episode 1, I knew something grate is coming, only crossed my fingers not to be disappointed by the end. I wasn't. Furthermore, for it's in top 3 of my favourite TV shows.<br/><br/>Greatly recommend it to everyone who likes great story and brilliant actors and dialogue, It is amazing how subtle and sensible the show was made for its 8 episodes only! ENJOY! P.S. These are the best year and a half for Mr. McConaughey, for sure. I have rated this show ten out of ten. Not many of the hundreds of shows I have seen in my life have met the criteria necessary for this rating but this is one of the few. The electricity between the central two characters is palpable and leaves the audience in a near constant feeling of unease. The dialogue is intense, philosophical and thought-provoking (although sometimes requiring a rewind to listen again more closely). I think it is safe to say that many viewers will see the episode 4/5 mark as the peak of the show. 4 being the masterfully shot biker gang shootout and 5 leading to the execution of ledoux. Despite these highlights, the show is a wonder to watch and I cannot wait for the next season, although I am sad to see Mathew and Woody go.<br/><br/>This praise is well and truly deserved for this show but it is also important to mention some of the faults I found in the finale of the season. The aim of the finale should have been exactly that, a finale, a place to tie up loose ends, and the final conclusion to 8 hours of prime time television. But the show wasn't exactly that. An easy solution would be to simply have another episode, devoted to the Yellow King and the ritualistic cult that he was a part of. I am dying to know more about his fascinating character, the origin of his scars, his constantly changing accent, his relationship to his grand-father etc. This is all valuable information and I feel like the show missed out on this. Secondly, and finally for the sake of over-writing this review. There was not enough investigative work into finding the yellow king. Cohle and Hart went from 0 to driving to the yellow king's house in about 30 seconds. I really wanted more time devoted to finding this man who had eluded them for 17 years.<br/><br/>Anyway, do not let these final words, discourage you. This series is a piece of philosophical art that will become a landmark for serious dramatic television. Everyone must watch it Last year it was Breaking Bad, although it was the year it ended. But True Detective will be remembered for when it started rather than when it ends, if more seasons are produced, that is.<br/><br/>Matthew McConaughey & Woody Harrelson's characters are so deep, it would take a person days to jump and then die in their depth. Their lives interfere with each other's as they try to solve a crime story. But, there are twists. Yes, not singular, but plural' twists at every node of the series. 8 episodes of pure crime that deals from voodoo to child abuse to sex to death to life.<br/><br/>I was gob-smacked to find such a beautiful writing. Cinematography is another thing. Hands down, music is what will also be remembered of True Detective and T Bone Burnett is again on my top ten lists of all time great music directors. The two leads have given breakthrough performances and I am glad I checked this show out.<br/><br/>But, then again the first five episodes are mind-boggling and it fades. Not to fret about how the finale was not up to the mark, True Detective, at the end of pondering, lies in the same old bench of indifference. If you look closely, Nic Pizzolato has tweaked the whole crime scene her, playing with emotions and relationships. But he wins, however with character building.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: Recommended because it is more likely that you may have a different perspective for the show than your neighbor. It asks its viewers's absolute discretion. And that is why it is different. This show has set the bar really high.Everything starting from the outstanding casting, direction, screenplay and the story telling is so meticulously handled that you keep craving for more. The most outstanding bit of this show is that you do not want to miss on any bit of dialogue. Every piece of uttered word conveys something. Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson have put in outstanding performances in this buddy cop crime thriller. Marty and Cohle have caught the intensity to perfection without going overboard. It is impressive to see two top actors not competing rather working together in such a fashion that every scene comes alive with the chemistry they share on and off screen. Both characters are not shy to depict their vulnerabilities.<br/><br/>This show is like a movie made in 8 parts. Each episode blends in to one another with unassumed ease. As you start going from scene to scene episode after episode it is like going through the seven course meal. Nic Pizzolatto has to be given credit for bringing everything together in a seamless fashion. The Story telling and the sheer arc of 17 years is handled so perfectly by Nic Pizzolatto. The thing i like about Woody is that he is more than happy to let McConaughey dominate a scene which in my opinion is a great asset to have for any actor. some actors get insecure when their fellow actor has the better lines or a slightly stronger role. It is a show every person irrespective of the genre he follows should it a try. I do not want to go in to the plot cause i feel this show is best watched without any pre-conceived ideas. Love this series more than anything I can remember. From the hypnotizing opening theme to every scene True Detective plays like a movie, which is the highest praise I can give to television. Beside the amazing leads, the location is an integral component. Character development is beautiful and the interplay between Matthew and Woody adds tremendously to the feel of the piece. Writing, Cinematography, Directing, supporting cast are all superb. I expect this to be the one to beat come Emmy time. My #1 wish is to see these two back next year...know that's not what's supposed to happen...but I can dream right? The void left by Breaking Bad is now filled. I was looking forward to this show ever since I heard Matthew McConaughey would be in it. I've watched all his movies and I'm a huge fan. The promos raised my expectations. And then the show exceeded my expectations! I knew it would be good but I didn't know it would be this good. I just finished Episode 6. McConaughey is superb as Detective Cohle and Woody Harrelson is fantastic as Detective Hart. The show is dark and gritty. An awesome intro, a gripping storyline, stellar acting and stunning visuals are the highlights of the show. True Detective is a must-see. Highly recommended. Upon first hearing about this series it immediately had my attention. A police drama featuring Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey has to be able to bring something special to the table. And it most certainly does. Now, i may not be the most objective reviewer. Seeing as that I easily tend to like police drama's. However, this series is light-years ahead of most of it's closest peers. The plot develops quickly but leaves plenty questions unanswered, it is not so much a whodunit. But more about the development of the main characters. The acting is great. Not completely surprising when a series features 2 Oscar-nominees in the lead roles. But so far it has mainly been the interesting way series deals with its chronology that keeps me coming back. This paired with the great and very dark (sometimes) dialogue makes this a definite must- watch. My only problem with this series is that i am very unsure as to how they are going to continue with it. This might very well be a series with a lifetime of only one or two seasons. My fears are reinforced by the fact that the main characters are two A-list actors, who may have trouble with shooting a new season every year. Therefore, let's enjoy this series while it lasts. Blimey, so many good reviews. I've watched the first 2 episodes and couldn't bear to watch all of the 3rd. Gave up. Slow, slow, slow and how's it gripping. A bit of interest there but gripping never. It's hardly 24 for God sake.<br/><br/>Watching in the UK and was told about this show and thought OK, looks good. Having watched Out of the Furnace, True Detective is in the same class. BORING!!! Don't be mugged off by people telling you it's a great show, it's not, it's a put you to bed show, it really is.<br/><br/>Just hammered Season 1 House of Cards in 3 days, now that is a show.<br/><br/>Just out of interested I backed TD half way through episode 3 just so I could watch the last 2 episode of HoC before TD sent me to into a coma.<br/><br/>Don't bother you'll never get the time back. I really was looking for to see a good crime series, but after the first episode I decided to stop watching. I did not like the tone of the series, the story was unfolding very, very, very slow, and after the first episode ended I just did not know what the series is about (oviosly about a murder, but otherwise it did not have a clear direction), I did not care about the murders, about the victims or about the detectives. A series must hook you from the pilot episode, True Deetective just did not do that for me. Maybe because I am not from the US, but the whole southern vibe was just too distracting. The actors were good, but if you saw one drama with Matt you know how he is going to play it, so no surprises there. The same I have to say about Woody. Good acting, but no surprises - just like the other dramas they acted before. Maybe i expected too much, and the following episodes are better, but I did not want to invest in a series that bored me from the opening titles. First off, I don't traditionally like MM, but hands down he is the superstar of this show. Sure, WH does an excellent role as well, but he always does.<br/><br/>It is quite a feat for them both to make the viewer, at least partially, sympathize with such broken characters. They philander, do drugs and drink.<br/><br/>Technically, the show is stunning. It seem a bit unsaturated - gorgeous. And some scenes are so amazing that I suspect each take took several tries.<br/><br/>For me, this being so stunning visually and acting-wise, is what makes a given 10 a 9. See, the story has us following one case (ish) and although it has begun well, there is no way it matches the other parts. There better be some massive twists and turns to even come close to what MM is doing here. If you hadn't saw True Detective yet, then your life is worthless Loved season 1, disappointed by season 2, season 3 was a complete waste of time. Season 3 in sum, a dumb detective who is a master in screwing things up. Enjoyed season 1. Had to give up on seasons 2 and 3 after watching just a few episodes. Season 3 might even be the worst detective series ever produced. Twas more of a soap opera than a mystery and boring as hell. Not being able to rate seasons on their own, I'm giving all of them a 3 star rating so at least people will be spared from watching seasons 2 and 3. So, overall, I did like it although there are a few points that do need making, ie, the tight enunciation of the main character is a little frustrating, I kept having to rewind to hear the words and try to translate according to what the other characters had to say. I like the story line and how true to life something like that was portrayed EXCEPT the end!!!!! I knew who that Lucy kid was! She looked just like her mother at that age, I can't believe the otherwise dogged detectives did not see it! And truly, Wayne' oddessy was nearly finished, he had it in hand, he KNEW and then the Alzheimer's turned him into a puddle of confusion just has he was looking Julie in the face?????? And what about her, SHE did not recognize HIM????? I want to cry with upset. Season 3 should never have been handled like season 1. In the end all those mysterious creepy demonic air turned out to be just a show, to keep viewers wondering something shocking would happen. That wasn't the case. It had happy and yet unsatisfying ending; which was a slap on the face. For this season, mysterious mood would've sufficed.
Oh and one more thing, Why the heck did they make that last remembering scene so dramatic? Like there's going to be a twist or something, making me, viewers, wonder somethin shocking is finally going to happen? It was totally unnecessary. With the third season of True Detective coming very soon, I have decided to watch the previous seasons starting with the first season of the show. I have finished the first season and I was gripped by it and intrigued the majority of the way. The premise of the season sess two former detectives being interviewed about a case from 1995 as they retrace the story through flashbacks. Matthew Mcconaughey is absolutely amazing in this show, he is just oozing charisma and the intrigue to make you want to find out more about this fascinating character. He has some really interesting views and it really helps flesh out this show and the amazing characters this show has. Woody Harrelson plays his partner in the show and this may be his best work to date, he is also really interesting to watch as he goes through a slightly different story but is equally as captivating. The relationship between these two characters really drives this show and is easily so entertaining to watch. Michelle Monaghan plays Harrelson's wife on the show and she does a great job aswell, she isn't your average female character, she is strong willed and a powerful female character that really adds something to the dynamic between the main characters. Pretty much everyone does a good job with the their roles, unfortunatley, I didn't like the villain's performance on the show, when it is revealed who the villain was I was underwhelmed especially by the character. The story is so compelling in the past as you go on a journey and investigation with these two guys, you are with these guys on the mission and you are really rooting for them. Though I will admit I wasn't particularly satisfied by the conclusion of the season as I felt like it was the weakest part of the story. The script is excellent with twists and turns at any moment, the dialogue works for the two characters and makes you question beliefs that these characters have. The style of the show is great, it is very vibrant and clear, it shows everything and doesn't hold anything back which allows you to become even more invested in the story. Overall this is a great season of tv that should be watched if you are a fan of gripping television. Matthew McConaughey is legend must watch before die season 1 masterpiece consciousness is tragic mis step in human evolution , I'd give season 1 8.5/10 and season 2 6/10, while most people are saying 10/10 and 1/10.<br/><br/>Season 1 was very good, but despite everything, despite all its depth, long conversations, existential angst and philosophy, it ends up with a shootout with some kind of inbred weirdo who lives in a cabin (in the South, obviously). The final piece of the puzzle was the equivalent of a chainsaw-wielding hillbilly.<br/><br/>Having said that, it's still very good. The investigation is not obvious, the clues aren't a convenient trail of breadcrumbs to lead the detectives to the bad guy, the sub-plots are very interesting, the relationship between the detectives and others (wife, other cops, etc). The music and score are very good, as is the cinematography, casting, acting, dialogues and action.<br/><br/>Season 2 attempts to do the same, but it goes from "rich tapestry" to outright confusing, with so many sub-plots, so many characters introduced in a very short period of time and not enough time for all the information to sink in. It still has a lot of the things that made season 1 so good - casting, acting, complexity, music, locations, cinematography, but is let down by weaker screenplays: weaker overall story and weak episodes.<br/><br/>The first season felt like the result of years of work, research, editing (the screenplay), refinement, distillation and perfection. Season 2 felt like all that done over a period of a few months or so.<br/><br/>Had season 2 been aired before season 1, people would have liked it and been wowed by the next season. Instead people are feeling disappointed, having expected something equal or better.<br/><br/>Despite my criticism, they're both good, with season 1 much better than the second, but far from perfect. Review of Season 2: If you watched S1 and expected something similar, you'll likely be disappointed with S2. Starting with the intro credits song which can't hold a candle to the fantastic "Far From Any Road."<br/><br/>While S1 offered a stellar cast, S2's cast is questionable. Colin Farrell can act but so can lots of other people. Vince Vaughn has been known so far as being an annoying guy in lame comedies. Rachel McAdams is gorgeous but here she's made to look far less attractive. And she wasn't even the producers's first, second, third, or fifth choice. <br/><br/>S1 was an authentic tour de force in television. But soon enough media inquisitors and race-and-gender-baiters appeared accusing the show of being inadequate to Hollywood's political goals. Surprisingly the show creator and HBO, thus far a rebel network, caved in to political pressure with an enthusiasm worthy of the worst of networks, ABC. As a result, in S2 the story matters far less then the urge to advance a pathetic sociopolitical agenda. From the start, McAdams character is presented as the alpha girl who treats her male lover like garbage while he, a cop no less, just takes it. Kitsch's CHP officer Paul is a closet homosexual who needs to take erectile dysfunction medication when he wants to be intimate with his girlfriend. Vaughn's mobster Frank is sterile and sometimes impotent as well and can't give his wife Jordan a child. Ferrell's Ray is a mess of drugs and alcohol. And so it goes with all male characters. In case you weren't clear about the order of things, on their way to a raid, Ani leads followed obediently by dozens of male cops, officers, and agents. <br/><br/>But the biggest change is the uninspired story told in a roundabout way. A Vinci city manager is killed in a strange way and his body placed somewhere. Paul finds the body on his way to committing suicide. Ray is a corrupt cop of the corrupt industrial city Vinci. Ani is assigned to the case by the state to uncover corruption in Vinci. As a result all three end up in the murder task force, all pulled by different strings. Ray is beholden to Frank and is getting divorced. His wife is contesting paternity of their son as well, a son who couldn't look more different from his two parents. Frank has to deal with his lovely and loyal wife demanding children at a time when the death of the city manager meant a loss of millions for Frank. In his time of weakness all sorts of mobsters (Armenians, Mexicans, Russians) show up devour what's left of his wealth. He wants Ray to track his money lost by the dead guy. Ani is dealing with the needy cop boyfriend and is being pressured by the state to get Ray on corruption. She has a traumatic past of abuse at the hands of her dad's spiritual cult. Paul has to deal with his girlfriend who is demanding more, a mother who stole his money, and a former male lover who shows up to blackmail him. The city itself has its own agenda. <br/><br/>For several episodes the investigation doesn't go anywhere. All they have to go on is the name of a high class prostitute. At least mid-season we get a cool shootout that comes out of nowhere and establishes Paul as a bona fide bad ass. Near the end we get a decent orgy-party. Following the shootout we meet our cast after several months--Paul a decorated agent, Ray out of the force and working for Frank, Ani can't let the case go since they didn't discover any answers. She's then asked by the state to keep working on the case and re-recruits Ray and Paul.<br/><br/>Through this messy story that advances in a crawl, it's Frank that turns out the most interesting character and surprisingly Vaughn's performance also a high point as a honorable, fair, and loyal criminal. Although it's trough Frank that the writer engages in strange writing excesses. Frank's relationship with his wife is the only reasonable relationship here, in fact, one of the best husband-wife portrayals on television. They are there for each other, they support each other. Jordan knew what she was getting into with Frank, she is there for him when he needs her and retreats when things get ugly. It's not a co-dependent relationship nor a transactional relationship among two super independent individuals. But rather they function as a unit, a couple. The "us" comes always first. Of course they have to remind each other of that, but it's something they work on. They have goals, a plan, and both of them work toward it in their own way. <br/><br/>If we set aside the superficial politics, the second main theme here is loyalty and fairness. Loyalty between members of a couple (Frank and Jordan), loyalty among members of a crime syndicate (Frank and Nails, Frank and Ray). Frank's word counts. Frank does his best to negotiate things with the various functions out to ruin him but when he's left with no other choice he resorts to violence and it's in the final episodes that we get some more great action thanks to Frank and Ray. In the final episode all questions are answered and the pessimistic and depressing end leaves the viewer mightily unsatisfied. Nevertheless, even this season of True Detective manages to create an intimacy between the show and the audience that makes you care, even after one disappointing episode after another. <br/><br/>Unlike season 1, there's not much to learn here. In the whole season there must be only a handful of good lines. There won't be a quotable S2 despite Frank's verbose introspections as there are sites of Rust quotations from S1. Even as a standalone series, Season 2 of True Detective doesn't convince and is only marginally above average. This show is absolutely stellar! <br/><br/>It is simply one of the most intricate and well put together TV show's I've ever seen. The casting is perfect. Matthew McConaughey is hauntingly good as the seemingly dark and damaged Rust Cohle while Woody Harrelson as the angry and stubborn Marty Hart. Both actors are so committed to their roles it is hard to see them as just TV characters and not real people. <br/><br/>This show is no regular cop drama or murder mystery. It is so much more and has proved so. The episodes pick up momentum slowly but with such smoothness and with such a unique pacing, it is hard not to get sucked into the story and lives of these two men. Not only is the main story line superb but how they blend all the back stories and show you how each character are who they are is fantastic.<br/><br/>I think that Rust Cohle is one of my favorite characters from any show or movie. They way they build his back story and why he is the way he is, it's one of the single best examples of how to make characters believable. <br/><br/>This is hands down, one of the greatest abet darker show's that has ever been made. "Once there was only dark, seems to me light is winning."<br/><br/>One hell of a bang!! Nerve-racking, mesmerizing, and addictive from the get go!! The entire cast did a fine job. Woddy and Mathew blew my mind with their performance. I don't know many fancy words, else would have used the entire dictionary of phrases corresponding to awesomeness to describe this series. Watched the last five episodes in one go.. Music scores, locales everything else, perfect. Got high just watching this. LOL. Hope season 2 is as good.<br/><br/>I would still give it a 9 cos I believe nothing is perfect and there is always room for improvement.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend this. If you are looking for a series which includes outstanding performances by two professional actors , wonderful dialog's and mysterious screenplay that's what exactly you are looking for . At first I thought it's another piece of s○○t because I don't enjoy something like law and order or even dexter but this piece of art made my head explode . I think this series is more than a thriller ; it has too much to say , and it makes you compare two different type of personalities . On the other hand you can hate this series if you don't accept detective Rust and his comments , me myself don't accept all of his opinions but If well came it with open mind and it makes you enjoy ! Spending the summer catching up on cable series I have got the chance to start multiple series, including the "incomparable" Breaking Bad series I am here to tell you that this series "True Detectives" is just as good, and in many facets BETTER than the aforementioned series. The two leads are showing a maturation in their talents that have come together to create a stranglehold on excellent portrayals of what it means to work in a profession/ world where lines get blurred between dedication and illegality. The casting for the two roles was perfect! Woody Harrelson does an excellent job at portraying the "company man" cop, with inadequacies of being a father and a husband. Not since the season he did on Will and Grace, has Woody been so spot on with the role he has been casted. Then there is Matthew McConaughey, WOW!!! I thought it would be hard to invest anymore than he had in "Dallas Buyer's Club", but his performance in this series is above and beyond; at least in the first season. The character being that of a lost soul, ex-family man, and state created addict through years of Narco undercover work. The portrayal is gritty, solid, and constantly real. The script was laid out for both of these fine actors to shine, and they do! The first season is intense through the groundwork of the first three episodes being laid out in character development, and evolution of relationships. Then the fourth episode comes, and BOOM!!! Screaming from beginning to the end of the season with nonstop, eyes glued, enthralling storyline! Next thing you know you're saying to yourself, "Season 2 is out, right?" If you are a fan of quality set design, writing, camera work, and story development, then GIDDEE UP!!! 10 out of 10, even for the music production!!! How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days, Failure to Launch and Ghost of Girlfriends Past, these films will no longer be associated with Matthew Mcongaughy as he takes a role which flexes his acting muscles and makes me wonder why it has taken so long for us to see him show us the goods.<br/><br/>True Detective is one of the most haunting, eerie, disturbing and get-under-your skin TV series in the last decade. Not since Twin Peaks has a show terrified and enthralled me in equal measure. The vast Louisiana landscapes and the hot, stuffy and dangerously close atmosphere can be felt from the off.<br/><br/>The show cleverly goes back and forth in time and beautifully manages to stay untangled giving the viewer an opportunity to view the story from the perspectives of two police officers working a murder investigation and the people around them who are affected by everything to do with it. Despite its atheist, nihilistic undertones and a dark brooding atmosphere, True Detective is as intriguing as it gets!<br/><br/>Although one of the two main protagonists is your average cop (Woody Harrelson) but the other one (Matthew McCounaghy) is way too complex, nihilistic and disturbing to be efficiently developed, yet Nic Pizzolatto the show's creator does a phenomenal job in developing his character without getting too philosophical.<br/><br/>The same is the case with pretty much every character, Pizzolatto is far from shy to keep them gray and that said they appear splendidly real.<br/><br/>Although the plot is yet another serial killer hunt but it is dense than anything you have ever seen, in fact the depth is so spell-binding that the series makes successful serial killer efforts on the big screen i.e. Se7en etc. look mediocre! and in that regard a big part of the credit goes to the series director Cary Fukunga who has directed all the eight episodes from the first season.<br/><br/>However, despite the Fukunga and Pizzolatto partnership being the show's bedrock it is McCounaghy who is the true star of the first season. Although it is arguable that he got the best role as well but McCounaghy gives a career best here; even better than his Oscar winning performance in Dallas Buyers Club!<br/><br/>Nonetheless, True Detective's first season is a game-changer in every word with popular movie stars like Emma Stone already showing an interest to work in the second season. Television is certainly on its way to outperform the Box Office if not financially then critically with TD set to lead it from the front!<br/><br/>for more reviews, follow: <br/><br/>http://mightywingback.wordpress.com/ It is hard for me to give a perfect score to anything, but True Detective is deserving of such recognition. Yes there could have been something bigger to finish it off, but it would have taken away from the human nature of the story. The characters are after all human and as such can only do so much. I guess I truly enjoyed the 'world is much bigger than this' type mentality that it leaves me with in the end. We all are part of the world and if it is messed up it is so because we made it that way.<br/><br/>Plot: The story takes us through roughly 9 years of a crime investigation on a possible serial killer. Rust Cohle is the best character I've seen on a TV series since Mulder in the X-Files. The flow is fluid because all the episodes were directed by the same person and for that I am thankful as well. It showed great coherence from one episode to the next. Rust discovers that people of great importance in the state of Louisiana are involved in the murders and that's when s@&$ hits the fan. His partnership with Hart is very compelling all the way to their breakup and reunion to solve the case. I understand the ending was rushed and I feel almost compelled to drop the rating a notch for it, but it left me satisfied nonetheless. It is the first time I've seen a story telling me about a problem and not resourcing to supernatural means to solve it. It was a human tale from start to finish and I loved it. As for me, best television I've seen in a long time.<br/><br/>Verdict: Not suitable for everybody. The high content of dark obscure messages including child abduction, rape and murder, conspiracy, moderate sex scenes, alcohol and drug use make it impossible to be digested by everyone. If you are too sensitive to the realities of human nature and the cruelties it is capable of or easily offended by not politically correct terms, steer clear of this one. True Detective requires a level of understanding of the world that, simply put, not everyone is capable of achieving. Wow, so boring. I normally prefer fantasy series, but yeah this really took slow to another level. I cant understand how Breaking bad is 9.6 and this is scoring 9.4. Breaking Bad had big changes happening in almost every episode but this has nothing. Perhaps the most surprising thing thus far is that Harrelson is cheating on his wife, but even that is no big deal when you really don't give a crap about that character. There's nothing likable about him, no way to empathise. Rust Cohle is an interesting character but do I really want to just watch a character do his thing or do I want to see something happen in an episode. It may be fair to say the characters are interesting but stagnant, nothing surprising about them really.<br/><br/>Acting is good but nothing really happens in an episode. By the 3rd episode I'm driven insane and have to stop. Yes against everybody here this series is awful. I give it 2 star Because of the great cast. woody and matthew are the finest players and their game there amazing and mesmerizing. What do the plot of the series is not interesting and flowing, the story is moving very slowly and at some point it's getting tiresome. This is a very dark series, often you just don't understand what the poet wants to say.<br/><br/>Cynical use of nude women unnecessarily. Dialogues are trying to be Tarantino but they really do not even close.<br/><br/>In summary anyone looking for an excellent game with very strange plot, this is the right series.<br/><br/>For those who like Mainstream TV show and want a bit of interest, this isn't not really the correct series. <br/><br/>some people think this is a masterpiece. I think someone is selling us Bullshit wrapped in a beautiful paper. I had high hopes for this. MM and WH starring in an HBO production, how can that not be a hit? Well, if the premiere is any indication this is not only not a hit, but it is painful to watch. An hour later I had no idea of where the plot of this show is going and I had a massive headache. Maybe it will "pick up". I hope so, although it's not as though MM and WH careers hinge on this.<br/><br/>The show has a reasonably interesting premise but so far it has been unveiled in a ploddingly slow way. I do find MM interesting in the way that his future character is so different from his 1995 character. The set location of this series is horribly depressing. So the depressing set, plodding storyline and slow pace just don't make me interested in watching it again. ..who thinks this show, or at least the first two episodes, have been quite lame? For all its bluster, the dialogue and plot is predictable, the characters wooden -- Mcconaughey, an oh-so-mysterious man whose backstory is constantly being projectile vomited at the audience, is more effective than Harrelson, a caricature confusingly surrounded by beautiful women. The nude woman in episode 2 is, to understate things, remarkably beautiful. But the scene was unbelievable, gratuitous and unnecessary. It was offensively pandering. I was really hoping to like True Detective, but it stinks so far! Maybe they'll kill off Woody Harrelson's character and add a few clever plot twists. This season to my surprise maybe be the best one. (Series One was a bit strange and Series Two was moody and depressing like every scene was shot on an overcast day). The acting and dialogue is very impressive. Sopranos as the last TV show, that had quality writing. Its like your are watching the documentary channel and more realistic than all the reality series. Do you need plastic surgery to be on a reality series.
I do not know these actors well. Actors are so laid back, like they are not even trying. Stephen from the blade movies, i didn't know he was such a fine actor. Maybe he can take this as a jump start / boost in his career.
Like the other series, lot of the story is outside the case. Lots of family and relationship stuff, which is possible in 8 hours.
Very pleased. I wouldn't be in law enforcement though. Every hour is like 10 years off your life.
keep watching and keep your finger on the remote. I liked season 1, but thought the ending was a bit too clever, too contrived. Season 2 was forgettable. Season 3 was a masterpiece. It spans 3 time periods: the initial incident in the 1980s that leads to a police investigation; the middle period, 10 years later, when the investigation is reopened; and the final period, when the surviving characters have all aged. The characters all work for and against each other throughout the story, some of them weak or compromised, some of them driven. The acting is all the best it could be, the characters all credible, their reactions, doubts, fears, suspicions all real. It's a lame comparison, but this is like Game of Thrones without dragons and fitted into modern times. Unlike Game of Thrones, the ending of season 3 was smart and not predictable. No cliches here.<br/><br/>A word of caution -- the story can be difficult to follow because it jumps back and forth through the three time periods. It helps to watch with someone else for confirmation of what you think you heard or saw. The producers prudently gave us appearance clues. The main character has a bushy Afro in the earliest period, a closely trimmed cut in the middle period, and gray hair in the final period.<br/><br/>Thanks to Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey for producing and starring in the first season and then producing two more seasons, the last being one of the best series ever produced for television. One word - a masteriece. Just skip entirely season 2. You will thank me later. Good actor, great story, good music, great scene.
what more do you want ? I can not understand all the bad reviews ... The otherwise excellent third series of this slow-moving, gradually unfolding blend of police thriller and psychological investigation of memory itself is marred only by some of the worst dialogue audio clarity in the history of TV. Whole scenes are almost incoherent, with down-speaking actors recorded by someone who doesn't know the first thing about audio clarity, eq'ing or mixing. It was bad in the first two series, this time it's pathetic. I can't think of a single tv show, from anywhere or any time, that was so poorly served by its audio technicians. Which is a real pity as the story is very good and the performances, when you can hear them, mostly top class After watching season 1 with the excellent cast and story line one would expect to watch a similar story unfold. Season 2 is very different...it shows a varied darkness in the detectives, each having their own " demons " they carry, so true to life as a cop. The story begins as we see three different cops cross paths and all from different agencies but working together. They have one case they work together on but each has their own hidden agenda as does many of the characters in the supporting cast have. <br/><br/>Vince Vaughn shows his ability to change the persona he demonstrates usually in comedies to a dark organized crime boss. He captures the strong, violent criminal thats trying to gain more and he gets screwed. He's " ticked off " and he wants answers and the people responsible. He's a manipulator of people, including some cops. Excellent performance on Mr. Vaughn's part.<br/><br/>Colin Farrell shows his excellent acting abilities to become the cop that's fallen, who's career path changed after some of his own actions. Drinking, drugs, violent behavior, a man on the edge. Life threw him a curve ball and he allows that to dictate his path into darkness. He's on the " juice " provided by Vaughn's character who uses him to his advantage. Mr. Farrell plays his role very believable and some redemption is in his grasp.<br/><br/>Rachel McAdams does an outstanding performance where she too is a focused cop, one with a past and has the " I don't give a Sh** " attitude. She has no problem operating in a male dominate career. She has no problem kicking somebody's butt or using edged weapons or firearms.<br/><br/>Taylor Kitsch is the frustrated motor cop, a veteran of the war, a true operator but one that's denied a latent issue. The case allows him to utilize his true talents as an operator. Mr. Kitsch performance, especially as a Special Operator now a cop. I could see his training from Lone Survivor where he was SEAL Lt. Mike Murphy come to the surface. <br/><br/>Again, this series is worth watching and the action was very realistic when engaging armed suspects. Each actor did a great job portraying cops under fire and staying on point. The political and power backdrop where everybody wants something is again very true to real life. <br/><br/>Highly recommended viewing I waited for this one desperately and I had high hopes for it. Season 1 was like my grey cells were getting some kind of hard work out. I just loved it.<br/><br/>Season 2 is more like a loose end, nothing like season 1, It ended with too many unanswered questions and many disappointments. the main crime and its criminal seems insignificant.<br/><br/>At the end of season 1 there was sense of ending and satisfaction but season 2 is just....I don't get the point.<br/><br/>My suggestion to people who gona watch it now is don't compare it with season 1 its a master piece and it will remain so.......season 2 is just pointless. It is the story of two detectives investigating a murder which it leads them to more complicated case of Missing Persons specially children. from the start the crime scene is full of Demonic Symbols and Detectives conversation full of Philosophic ideas . I (as a person who studied Math and Philosophy in University ) found it very Cool and Smart Story until the Final Episode which Ruin the whole series for me ! Rust (detective with a lot of smart and very Deep philosophical ideas) has a very scientific idea of living and always is saying fear of death is the reason people have faith in God ... in final episode Rust has a near death experience but after surgery he comes back to life and then claims he just felt Love in that moment he was near death and his daughter (who died years ago) was waiting for him and then starts crying and u will see the smart guy who always mocking Religious persons has changed !!! and the End !!! BTW good story and good details but the ending ... No , it really doesn't suit ! /refers to Season 1/<br/><br/>I tend to like gloomy crime series, where felonies are not glamorized and detectives do not look wealthy fashion models, but as for the plot, there are 2 options for me: either the evildoer is latent to the very end, or he/she is known from the beginning and one can follow his/her actions and law enforcement efforts to catch and punish. Here, the content is focused on detectives only - in past and present, the pace is protracted, and the essence of the crime and the offender's person were evident too soon. Thus, both the pre-ending and ending are rather trivial as well.<br/><br/>True, Matthew McConaughey as Detective "Rust" Cohle and Woody Harrelson as Detective "Marty" Hart are splendid, there is a good chemistry between them regardless how they get along, but the rest are just good (perhaps due to non-elaborated characters), and there is no fitting antagonist present who could provide intensity and witty nuances to potential cat-and-mouse play. <br/><br/>And last but not least: the almost 8 hours is too much, it could have been easily shorter twice, or a 2-3 hours TV-movie. It was started without any idea. All I knew about the show was only the cast. To be honest, I could not be sure if I would go on until the third episode. It took some time to accept/get used to the personalities and slow tempo. But on the fourth episode, I started to understand that this show would be one of the best shows I have ever watched! For me, since I have this experience, Matthew and Woody is the best couple of television/cinema/theater. Especially, the final episode was one of the most disturbing endings I have ever seen! In the last 20 minutes, I smoked more than 3 cigarettes! I suggested many of my friends to watch it and all liked it. I believe you will like it either 9/10 So, the thing is how you stick the idea inside someone's mind. And I believe the director knows is well enough, and the stories starting in the flashback is not a big thing @chistopher_nolan is great this type of things.<br/><br/>As long as it's played nicely I don't have a problem with it, and certainly why someone will, the appreciation goes directly to the leading role lead role actor @matthew nicely done, infect I'm thrilled with the role.<br/><br/>Now coming to the story it stands out and thats what makes it very distinct to the other detective shows like sherlock the @rust character played by @matthew is not super intelligent but he utilizes himself very fine to the job he have, now as it comes to main negative role you won't see much of him but that's not a worry you will understand him enough to justify the character.<br/><br/>The verdict to the 10/10 rating is I haven't seen a story that standout in a long time and played by the very talented cast it makes a show though to beat and the one you will love to watch. (Season 1) "True Detective" is a masterfully told whodunit that follows two very different detectives as they track a satanic killer over the course of 17 years. The first season of "True Detective" may just be the greatest mystery/thriller I've ever seen...on film or television. Much of the high praise goes to the acting (McConaughey is amazing!) and the mesmerizing cinematography. I'd put "True Detective" above Fincher's "Zodiac" and "Seven", and Mann's "Manhunter". Hell, even the opening credits are hypnotizing and beautiful! The first half of the season is slightly better than the second, but the entire series is an edge of your seat thrill-ride. Some viewers saw the finale as a letdown but I felt it was believable, realistic, and brought closure to the characters. This series deserves Emmy and Golden Globe love! It's an addictive show and I suggest watching them consecutively over a couple nights. A dark, brooding, and thrilling series.<br/><br/>On a smut note, you get to see Michelle Monaghan in a thong and Alexandra Daddario (Texas Chainsaw 3-D) has a full nude sex scene! And why do users review a series after watching only a single episode? That drives me nuts! Watch the entire season before you comment on a show. It's a story that's going to be told over the course of weeks and months...wait to see how it ends before you praise or bash it. Slow and simmering, with great acting by McConaughey and Harrelson. It just gets better and better. Great television. If they make another True Detective this one will set the bar. McConaughey is almost unrecognizable in his role as Rusty Cohle. Rusty's character is intriguing with a chilling intensity. Woody Harrelson is well cast as his partner.<br/><br/>This show is slow, dark and brooding, almost frightening in a sneaking up on you kind of way. It's a whole different kind of movie intensity. You don't want to miss an episode. Looking forward to see how it all comes together. HBO makes the grade with this one. This TV-show is the best I have seen, from many perspectives. <br/><br/>First and foremost, surprising for TV, the acting is flawless. Thanks to the professional, experienced crew (McConaughey delivers the role of his career), there is not a single second that makes you "go out" of the show. <br/><br/>In addition, the production is perfect, with very good music and innovative, immersive takes and scenes. <br/><br/>To top all that, the script is bold, daring, slow for starters to depict properly the characters, and taking off from episode 4 to never get back on Earth. <br/><br/>The result is a show which takes you for a tense, immersive journey that will blow your mind. Watch it, but take your time.<br/><br/>I love it! I must say i didn't know what to expect since i dived in the show knowing practically nothing about it and was hooked from the very first episode,the atmosphere is nothing i've seen before at least not in this caliber,its full of mystery suspense and filed with substance that many shows currently don't have,in that area is similar to darker episodes of breaking bad.I can't wait for the story to unveil,but have a hunch that it's going to blow my mind.<br/><br/>For the cast i must say that was surprised to see such natural chemistry between Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson its one of that shows in which you cant imagine anyone else in their roles. 17-years investigation is something to be shown on TV. The lines are genius. Every character in this show is justified with great act. Everything about this show is just addicting. It's more than like sniffing good stuff. Every episode that comes out is getting better than the previous one. The script is perfect. The characters being portrayed are justified and the plot of the series is just blatantly excellent. Indeed, True Detective is another winner for HBO. Respect to Rust and Marty. Every time the show ends, I tend to bang my head and crave for the next one. It keeps us absorbing more and more about it. It is soul- absorbing TV series. And the dark humor of it is very well stated. What a STELLAR performance by both actors. Slow but very tense and gives nothing away. So I sat back last fall and watched the last few episodes of Breaking Bad, thinking to myself that I would have to wait quite some time before a t.v. show of such quality were to be made, one that was brilliant on every aspect. Well, little did I know another show worthy of such praise was already in the works. <br/><br/>It has been said many times already in other reviews of this show that the pace may be painful for those looking for some quick entertainment, as this show requires more patience than most. But it is worth it. Picture Silence of the Lambs without the restraints of making a 2 hour flick, and voilÃ . <br/><br/>I had just finished watching the first two episodes, waiting eagerly for more. But after watching the third episode I am going nuts. That was one hell of a cliffhanger, and I cannot wait for Sunday. It is too early to deliver a verdict - but so far this is a very impressive piece of art by any standards. <br/><br/>First off a huge compliment to the Adam Arkapaw for the working his magic. There so many shots that are just plain beautiful to watch. I watched the first 2 episodes twice in a row and I did enjoy every little bit of it. It is nice to see HBO putting so much effort into making a TV series. Some shoots remind me of Dennis Hoopers paintings and others feel a little like Turner. Real eye candy all along! <br/><br/>The soundtrack is very neat - between the dialog and the music I can almost follow the story without watching. I also can't recall a moment being bored - and I am certainly not the most patient listener. And I just love the accents (being not an English native speaker I cant tell them apart - but they do sound "right") <br/><br/>Having watched 2 Episodes I am really eager to see more - it's definitely a addictive and intriguing story being very well told. I really look forward to see more of this series all with out much violence and gore. Great show! Can't wait for the next episode! The first season was amazing dialog with a sinister vibe throughout so I have to give this show 7stars and highly recommend the 1st season ONLY.<br/><br/>I didn't watch the 2nd season because all feedback was that it was garbage.<br/><br/>The 3rd season was a colossal disappointment. It started off as before with a sinister vibe and slow burn but it ended up being a boring show that I was happy to see end with no memorable dialog like the first season.<br/><br/>The creator/writer must have used up all his ideas in the 1st season and resorted to family drama to fill it in. What a massive fail. Started today season one and watched first 2 episodes and its done cant watch anymore it was too boring, too much This TV show is excellent. Both seasons (yes, no matter what critics say) are fantastic. The Woody-Mathew chemistry in the first season was mind-blowing, really, and the Season 2 cast has also been impressive. This dark anthropological drama depicts the investigations of different crimes seen through the eyes of different people.<br/><br/>The fact that Season 2 is being called slower than the first is because the performances in this season are great, really but, aren't the kind Woody Harrelson and Mathew put out. They set a high standard and nobody, I mean ever can do what they did in Season 1. So yes, it's a must watch for any Drama, Crime, Thriller or just plain-watch-a-good- TV-series guy.<br/><br/>This show is truly something deep and dark, detective, something deep and dark. I cannot understand how this show is up there with Breaking Bad, The Wire and Game of Thrones.<br/><br/>The acting is awesome, the setting is awesome, the acting is awesome, the characters are awesome, the opening credits are awesome... The storyline is not awesome.<br/><br/>It kind of reminds me of the rave about Gravity, it looks good, but the story was poor. I've watched many detective programmes, okay this one was different, but it is not as good as Luther for instance which also follows a dark path. The acting is better, but that doesn't recover the storyline. They chase up a lead for a whole hour that would usually get a 10 minute time slow.<br/><br/>This is the only review I have ever wrote, but I just felt I had to due to the massive overrating of this show. I didn't really care who the serial killer was, it was just a random guy at the end if it, you didn't even fully discover his family connections. The worst thing is that he was a deranged psychopath why makes me think he couldn't have been at large for so long? Surely serial killers exist because they fit in and don't draw attention to themselves? <br/><br/>If you want a great serial killer show I'd definitely recommend Dexter over this. 9.5 really is a laughable score for this, there's just no story. It's got all the ingredients except that, but it can look and sound as good as it wants, but without an amazing story to back it up it's not that great. Before speaking anything , i want to tell that i am not a kind of TV- shows man , i am more into movies . and rarely i could follow a TV-show .And so i watched a few number of TV-shows in comparison to movies . But, i am always concerned with the epic-shows ; that will deliver content in a different way .Lately , i watched game of thrones (all) , Spartacus (all) , and now it's 'true detective' .<br/><br/>If you think that you're about to watch that casual crime TV-show, you're wrong. This show is about a different realm . It will makes you think about life, purpose of it, humanity , time , yourself ,even m- theory !!! -a physics matter-. <br/><br/>IF you want to understand what i mean ,just follow Cohle 'by Matthew' in his scenes in the show especially when he was interrogated doing one way talking about everything.<br/><br/>I should tell you that this is not kind of linear-playing show , it will moves back and forth in time at every episode ,so get ready and catch every idea at the first moments especially at episode I ,so it will be easier for you to know what's happening in the next episodes.<br/><br/>Enjoy watching The first thing to say is that you have to give it 2 episodes to set the scene. I watched the whole series over a period of a week. I don't think I would have watched episode 2 after episode 1 if watching on TV. This is the sort of thing I like. A crime thriller with a healthy dose of the real world in terms of the crimes. If you enjoy programmes such as Ripper Street and The Shield, Breaking Bad, you should give this a go, but my advice is if you are not interested after 3 episodes to give it up. I have to say though that I was disappointed with the ending. It was not as disappointing as the ending of Breaking Bad but it was still too nice and Hollywood. I still give this series 9/10 and you're never going to please all the viewers 100%. Well done on the script and especially the casting. I love Woody. I binge watched this show over the past two days and haven't enjoyed a TV show this much since Breaking Bad ended. The few minor problems I had with the show we're immediately wiped from my mind after watching the near-perfect finale this morning. As I began watching it I feared each episode it would become "just another cop show" but it always veered off into an interesting, unique new path. My review may be quite biased as I am a big fan of both lead actors and also of Lovecraftian mythos, which this show blends perfectly into its narrative. This is a show filled with heart and soul (Hart and Cohle anyone?). The stellar performances by Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson are what make this show so special for me and I would strongly recommend it to anyone! No spoiler ahead.<br/><br/>I know it's a little early for me to say that the story can't get any better of the show. It's only episode 4 now. But I have good faith in its writing and I can already see the grand finale of everything coming. In fact I am confident because of how the show is structured. I like this style. Everything is set up already before shooting starts and the story will end in one season. New script with new story and new actors will be applied at the beginning of the second season (and I hope there are more to come).<br/><br/>The show has a bit of everything and is good to many tastes. I, myself as a avid suspense novel fan, can't shake off the feeling that this show was adapted from a famous novel, a distinguished one. Although I know it's not. And that's how well I like it. <br/><br/>I am glad that there aren't many television to my favorite now still showing and here is still one. Season 1 of True Detective, starring Matthew Mcconaughey and Woody Harrelson, is quite possibly the BEST SEASON OF ANY TV SERIES IN THE HISTORY OF FILM. Season 2 was a complete joke, and season 3 is an extremely weak and envious imitation of season 1.<br/><br/>There should be a different rating for each season since they are entirely different settings and actors. Seasons 2 & 3 should be deleted from history. This show is simply masterful on so many level. Nothing compares to the first one with Woody and Mathew, but this is still awesome. Season 1 was amazing. If you haven't seen this series yet a definite must see. (Just skip the badly written/acted/directed season 2 and go right to Season 3).
Spectacularly back on form for Season 3 with great acting performances all round, great writing and directing. Clever twists and turns will keep you guessing all the way through.
Can't wait to see what they come up with for (hopefully) a season 4. Season 1: True Detective has been a highly anticipated show when season 1 first premiered. Having watched the first season in its entirety when it first aired in 2014 but not remembering too much, a rewatch was needed, 07/10/19' - 07/13/19', and seeing and paying closer attention to detail, can see as to why this show and season is as praised. Both great performances from Matthew MccConaughey and Woody Harrelson which is what makes the season as great. The writing is top notch, and although the show starts off quite slow in the first few episodes it gets a better. With a solid ending. It showed a lot of promise for season 2 but we all knew it would be touch to match the greatness of the first season. Season 1: 9/10<br/><br/>Season 2: With more anticipating coming into this season following the success of season 1, this season was seen as a corner stone. And in the end it wasn't nearly as great, interesting and the writing for the characters just was not all that interesting. Colin Farrell was decent, but the rest were somewhat forgettable, and the thought of four main characters didn't completely work well. This season dragged on too much, was boring a lot of times and not completely intriguing or mysterious. Forget much about this season in detail but really have no desire to watch it again. Season 2: 4/10.<br/><br/>Season 3: Having lowering expectations for this season, but from reading several critics and audience comments about this season prior to watching, expected it to be better than season 2. And it was. (Watched from 07/01/19' - 07/05/19'). This was more closer to season 1 than season 2 and the leads were both strong and showed good chemistry. Much suspense and mystery in this season, as it felt slightly more dark and serious in tone. The three decades showing was great writing and at first slightly confusing but with the great makeup work on the characters, it was easy to tell which decade was which. Although the season finale was somewhat disappointed and didn't completely answer all the questions, overall season 3 was a great series and back to its roots. Question lies, Do we expect a season 4? Season 3: 8/10 TRUE DETECTIVE is a really messy show.<br/><br/>Lets get down to this by season:<br/><br/>First season is a good detective drama with some nice storytelling. Basically, the good stuff here, is how the action is broken up into different time-lines. Both Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey are great as detectives Cohle and Hart.<br/><br/>The story itself is not something special, and the resolution is the basic "modern TV drama" ending that you will expect - even though you might not figure it out before the end.<br/><br/>That said, season one is good TV and well worth the time watching it.<br/><br/>The second season (and this is what all the bad reviews are about) is messy. First of all, the storytelling is not as interesting as season one. Here, it's straight forward. The characters - this time acted by Colin Farrell, Rachel McAdams and Taylor Kitsch, are all good as respective detective - but they're not Harrelson and McConaughey.<br/><br/>And, what is worse, the characters are not likeable.<br/><br/>I understand what they did here. Start the show with a CHINATOWN (1974) story and let three "bad guys" be the Heroes. With bigger names, and a less convoluted story, that might have worked. But here, it's just messy and pretty weird at times.<br/><br/>Also - in season one things doesn't just "happen". Season two is filled with dumb decisions and stuff that doesn't really make any sense at all. The characters aren't likeable even after three-four episodes, and that is a huge problem.<br/><br/>Overall, season two is worth a look, but only if you don't have anything else to do.<br/><br/>Season three is better, and maybe the best. Interesting characters and well balanced broken up time-line storytelling again (this time three timelines!), is lifted even further with great supporting cast like Scoot McNairy (from HALT AND CATCH FIRE (2014-2017), a TV-series that is light-years better than this one, by the way) and Carmen Ejogo (ALIEN: COVENANT (2017)).<br/><br/>Here, we follow detectives Hays (Mahershala Ali) and West (Stephen Dorff). Both are good, but the character Hays is a bit difficult to like sometimes, but that of course makes the conflicts shine.<br/><br/>Interesting mystery, followed by a bit too "big" and "weird" ending, but still OK.<br/><br/>TRUE DETECTIVE is by far as good as some people say it is. And it is by far as bad as some say. It's not amazing, it's not the worst ever.<br/><br/>It's a bland pop-culture modern TV detective show with some great cast at times, cool story-telling techniques, and wonderful set pieces in the 80's drama-parts.<br/><br/>As a show, I will probably have forgotten all about it in a few weeks though. And I won't keep my eyes open for season four.<br/><br/>I'm happy I watched it, but today there are plenty of better shows to watch. The first season was absolutely amazing. Lots of twists and turns, keeps you wanting more. It will never be the same without McConnaughey or Harrelson.<br/><br/>Second season was horrible. I can't even tell you what happened or what was going on and I watched it twice.<br/><br/>I was excited for the 3rd season, hoping it would revive the show and make it great again. It was just ok...Ali and Dorff made a good combo but overall the season was a little underwhelming to me.<br/><br/>First season 10/10
Second 4/10
Third 6.5/10 I honestly say that this season is awesome i liked the idea going on in the times lines maybe they were some unnecessary scenes or scenarios but still it was a great case and story of the detectives, how they build it up how they ended and started, i liked the drama ,how they the couples were involved together , a teacher turned into writer and loved a former soldier and a detective and they both worked in the case i really suggest to try it and give this season a shot really enjoyed it It's a good thing this show started season 1 as a shining example of how great television and acting can be because every new episode since Season 1 finale has been circling the bowl of cancellation.<br/><br/>Season 3 is slow, lacks drama, lacks tension, ends like a damn Scooby Doo episode AND THEN after it ends it goes on for 30 more minutes. This is a review of the third season only.
The show started really well. The idea of splitting the story along three different periods of time (1980, 1990 and current) was very well done, acting and make up is superb. However as the episodes went along the show started to be too slow. No discovery was made in the investigation and the show focused on the bureaucracy of the police department in 1980 and 1990 at both times trying desperately to close the case and the corruption of the powerful Hoyt family, which for some reason in US TV series is ever present, meaning powerful families are somewhat immune to police investigations and are always able to distract police, bribe police, FBI and any government officials, and kill at will at anyone who is coming anywhere close to the truth.<br/><br/>I would have liked to see more details on the investigation and not just leave everything for the final chapter. Just finished watching season 3 and another disappointment.season 1 gets 10 stars from seAson 2&3 get 5 stars The first season of this series is nothing less than a masterpiece. It is probably the best detective story there is out there. Sadly, the second season is a completely different story. It should be called differently too, so you dont mix gold with plastic.<br/><br/>I hope the stars of the first season come back some day, and create a new season deserving the title of True Detective. Review Season one: 9 stars.<br/><br/>pros: excellent acting, excellent charterers, excellent story line, good production values, good music.<br/><br/>cons: some mumbling by the actors (can be fixed with switching English subtitles on), some slow moments (cannot be avoided and usually helped with story/plot).<br/><br/>Review season two: 3 stars pros: same gritty feel of season one, story provides some good scenes, music is good, good production values.<br/><br/>cons: not so well developed characters, overacting by almost everyone especially Vince Vaughn, at the same time most actors feel as if they are always distracted and just reading a script they were just given. Story and plot is so distracting (you don't know who did what to whom and what does this or that person have to do with anything) and the actors do not grab you enough to watch and re-watch to get a clue on what's going on. Also, lots of mumbling by Vaughn but this time English subtitles does not help because he is almost always irrelevant. Written and directed by young people, this show features the best and worst aspects of student work. What made the first season so brilliant is that the writer hadn't been around the industry long enough to need to "unlearn" the habits of TV writers, because he never learned them in the first place.<br/><br/>Instead of drawing on TV clichés or on life experience, writer Nic Pizzolatto worked from the fiction and philosophy he liked. The result was philosophical dialogue which most TV writers would have edited right out, but HBO was wise enough not to try to clean it up, and this made the show wonderfully unrealistic and refreshing. The best part is the way all of this rich literary and philosophical material plays against the stunning cinematic imagery.<br/><br/>The second season exposed the writer for what he is: a writer who can craft wonderful sentences but can't tell a story or fashion credible dialogue. The plot of season two is far more complicated, and therefore also full of more holes as Pizzolatto tried to make the story cohere, which it really didn't.<br/><br/>I think it's a strong compliment to say that the first season can be seen as among the best student films ever made. It'll be interesting to see Pizzolatto evolve as a writer. It's was really amazing show and I think they should end it after the first season. This a series of varying quality, so it's best to examine every season as if it were its own series.
The first season is a masterpiece, beautifully shot, with an especially interesting (and fresh for the time it came out) premise and fantastic acting by two of the greats of their generation. My advice would be to just watch the first season, which i honestly believe to be one of the greatest seasons in the history of television. (10/10)
The second season is a strange beast. The plot is muddled, with two many characters and plot points that converge only to create confusion. Another problem is how awfully miscast almost all the characters are, with Vince Vaughn trying way too hard to come off as a mob boss and ending up sounding comical. All in all, it's a mess, and even if it wasn't that confusing, there are main aspects of this season that are deeply problematic. (4/10)
The third season is mediocre. It is definetely not bad, and features some great performances. It is also incredibly unoriginal and boring, an obvious attempt to recreate the success of the first season by copying its setting and format. But that is a story already told, and it's clear the creators don't have much new to add. It is an ok season, that i imagine would seem way better to someone who hasn't watched to first season, but for me it seemed almost anachronistic, a been there done that affair. (6.5/10) 1st Season: Possibly the best TV show ever made.<br/><br/>2nd Season: Utter trash.
3rd Season: A super weak and envious little brother of the first season, with absolutely no depth/lore. If you are a fan of subtle, intelligent storytelling, True Detective season 3 is for you. The story moves forward by switching between 3 timelines and manages to transcend the base plotline by emphasizing how the ripples of a crime affect so many people's lives.
The story is structured in such a way, that even you pretty much aware of the outcome of some arcs, it still manages to surprise and sometimes shock you.
I think every one of us have some unresolved storylines in our lives and can relate on that level. The heavier the burden, the harder it is to forget and in this case it cannot be left unresolved. We see how this burden eats away the life of almost everyone who has a part to play.
Every little hint you get, leads somewhere and has an effect on the greater story. No hand holding, you have to pay attention.
Another important thing, that had me invested in the series is the integrity of the main character. I think heroes aren't defined by their triumphs, but by their perseverance in the face of failure. This is an important lesson, you should take with you, but there are so many other.
This is a slow burner, definitely not for everybody. A perfect blend of crime and character drama. Season 3 is definitely on par with season 1 and in my opinion it surpasses it in some aspects. Well, he is brilliant in this, intense and evocative, and even though at times it feels a bit hammed up, there's still something so dark and intense, pained coming through him. It's brilliant.<br/><br/>The philosophy that they speak through him as well, dark and intense, something so real in the middle of a detective story, just brilliant. And risky, I can imagine that the vaguely religious overtones, clearly a relatively non-Christian, non-mainstream point of view would have made this unpopular with conservatives in America. But they went for it, despite it being a bit polarising I'm guessing.<br/><br/>Cary Fukunaga does a brilliant job of evoking mood, and setting it beautifully in Louisiana. It's as if you can feel this menace, this foreboding presence, coming off every frame. Brilliant. Dark, but brilliant, just brilliant filmmaking. And they manage this trick of setting the series in poor, dilapidated areas that are clearly on location, and not sets, and yet making them oddly beautiful, harmonious. Fantastic.<br/><br/>Brilliant series, highly recommended. It's realistic,have a good story.Let see my opinion as seasons.<br/><br/>Season one,is the best of all three.good story love ne.<br/><br/>Season two,is also very good but it is way more complicated and realistic.i much enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Season three,is way more different than other two.the way they create the story is no clean,very much complicated,very slow movements than other two series,and aslo it is boring than other two.but i enjoyed it.<br/><br/>That's my opinion. First of all, I was already quite influenced by friends when I started watching the first season which I will now review. My expectations therefore where as high as they had probably never been, but they were even topped!!! The actors, the look, the direction, the writing: TOP. I must say, after letting the end sink for about a week, that I really fu*king love the first season of True Detective. This is definitely my all time Favorite. If you haven't seen it yet, just watch it, no regret, I'll promise.<br/><br/>Rating: 11/10<br/><br/>The end is the best one out there I think season 1 is the best thing ever. I mean Matthew McConaughey kills it. My rating is valid for the first season only which I found to be quite excellent indeed.<br/><br/>The writing and the embodiment of the characters was more than compelling. I found the whole adventure to be immensely intriguing and entertaining. The acting was first class as was the writing.<br/><br/>I gave season two a try but my expectations were so high after the first season that I was unable to get on board.<br/><br/>Season one will remain on my "tops of the decade" list. Woody is an excellent comedian. Matt brings the heat Perhaps that's the intent of the writers and producers - to make one think about repeated patterns of behavior, regret and desire for closure. We sense the frustration in every episode at having the mystery just outside their grasp.<br/><br/>The ending took a bizarre turn from previous seasons showing evil predators into the villain being a grief-stricken woman mourning over the loss of her daughter. This grief led to numerous murders, yet the ending seems to expect us to forgive or explain away this. BUT, how does an underground living area behind a massive safe vault door induce any sympathy in us? Are we to assume the victim only lived in that dolled-up prison when necessary?<br/><br/>The real victim, apart from the brother and sister of course, is the father. The mother is a monster as well - chose drugs and easy money over responsibility, as though selling off a child to wealthy murdering psychopaths is the right thing to do.<br/><br/>Final note, the last scene of the season has main character in a Vietnam flashback looking back at the viewer . My guess at the meaning of this is some type of time loop, Buddhist cycles message. That Vietnam is linked to the current case? Thanks to reviews I can´t be bothered with the next seasons. season 1 is wonderful, the rating does it justice, extremely high by the count of people and I suspect lower ratings are on account of the following seasons.
Even though it is moving at a slower pace in the beginning, the acting is amazing beyond words. Main characters are anti-heroes, have their own demons to deal with and I guess they carry the darkness needed to pursue this nightmarish case. Season 3 is back with a vengeance and keeps you hooked until the very end. Mahershala Ali and Stephen Dorff are fantastic as partners who have spent a lifetime stumped by a case that affected the trajectory of their lives. Great show! The second season took bit of a critical bashing which I thinks a bit unfair. The storyline is maybe not as 'clever' as the other two, but it is by no means a dud. I did get quite frustrated with the 3rd season, which had some of the most dire mumbling dialogue. The story line also seemed to lose its way about three quarters through, and the ending was somewhat contrived.<br/><br/>The real gem of the 3rd season is not Marhershala Ali, but Stephen Dorff who should be recognised fro his performance. I always wonder why woody talks as if he has chew in his mouth all the time? It is clearly a made up way that he seems to think adds to his acting. It certainly is dull. this show seemed to try to show every real feeling someone might have. It was dull. The first season of this show was briliant a long term investigation between two detectives showing the impact the job had on their lives, it was dark and intriguing the entire way through. Season 2 feels like hollywood wrote the script trying to cash in on its popularity just another rubbish tv show with decent name actors in a complete flop from the first season loosing all that waa great about the first season. Season 1: 10/10
Season 2: 7/10
Season 3: 9/10<br/><br/>There is so much to say about these 3 series that I could not do them justice. What I will say is:<br/><br/>Season 1 is my favourite TV show of all time, its gritty, gripping, intense and has a hugely satisfying ending. It's a must watch if you are a fan of detective shows. Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson act their parts flawlessly.<br/><br/>Season 2, although lacking some of the grittiness and intensity of season 1, is still a very good series. Don't expect it to have the same feel and atmosphere as the Season 1 but is still certainly worth viewing. Don't be fooled by the title, it is a completly different, but still worthwhile, experience.<br/><br/>Season 3 gets back to the same feel as Season 1 and makes for compelling viewing. The show was so intriguing, trying to work out what had happened. At the end of each episode I'd be guessing, and getting it wrong, as small pieces of new evidence was presented. The make up used to age the characters was impressive and gave it a more authentic feel that you were actually watching something from the period they were set in.<br/><br/>You could watch them as stand alone series but ensure you watch season 1 before season 3 and look out for the small references made in season 3 about the case from season 1.<br/><br/>Season 2 can be watched out of sync as it does not tie into the other seasons. Let me just start by saying True Detective season 1 is a masterpiece. It was one the best seasons of TV ever made,but I had to lower my rating to a 7 because of the mediocre mess that was the second season,but I wanted to give this show a chance with season 3 and after watching it I still felt it was quite unsatisfactory. It is an improvement from season 2 but the entire season was just slightly above average and definitely nowhere near as good as season 1. I'm leaving the show as a 7/10 out of my sheer love of season 1. Honestly the first season might have just been a fluke.
My rating for each individual season are as follows :<br/><br/>Season 1 = 10/10<br/><br/>Season 2 = 5/10<br/><br/>Season 3 = 6/10 I am still regarding the first season as an absolutely milestone in the history of series. To me it is the best season of any series ever. Closely followed by the 2nd season of Fargo.
The trailer of Season 3 looks so promising. I'm really looking forward to this. Tv series True Detective 1 and 2 are not a show for childish people. Really let me say that they are not even tv series but rather two full movies lasting more than 8 hours each. Intense, thrilling, full of a dense/deep sense of destiny and soul screeches that grow while the minutes flow. No joint episodes but a continuous crescendo of drama and bloody curse. Surely directly violent and continuously facing sexy facts. Sometimes resembling the western genre, sometimes Tarantino. Action anyway is not important, it's just necessary. The story is merely the road that the characters have to cross. Characters count, their lives count, their words, their passions matter. You just have to stare at their torments, at their choices and they will touch you. In this sense series 2 is a step forward series 1, is thicker and more wrinkled. I ended up loving all the main characters, even more in series 2 than in series 1, even the damned ones. Now a soft spoiler: series 1 speaks about going to Paradise, series 2 about a descent to Hell, both describe wading in a harsh Purgatory. End of the spoiler.
Series 3 is a question mark. I saw Mahershala Ali and I don't like him. I don't like his petrified face in the trailer of series 3. But I trust in Pizzolato and his magic team and after two masterpieces, I'm sure that also series no. 3 will be an intriguing success.
Overall, for me True Detective stands among the four outstanding tv series I've ever seen in more than 50 yrs. This merit is for exceptional direction, actor's playing, photography, script, songs, musics... Strongly recommended but not for childish lovers of action and fantastic movies. Recommended for lovers of humankind and true cinema. Great actors, great story and great tv! A must see This show is made of granite. Solid, rough on the edges but beautiful. Let's not forget that we are always fascinated by serial killers, catching them even more fascinating. Maybe we are fascinated because we are intrigued not because we have intentions to follow. Or maybe we want to save ourselves if we ever , God forbids, meet one. Since Woody possesses such a comic face , and Matthew such charm, it is very special that together they pulled this off. This is a clever, seamless, action ( but not testosterone) packed police show . For tellyphiles out there, this is a one of its kind series. No repetitions, no boring moments. From the haunting opening credits to the last bit of dialogue, True Detective season one is astonishing and unforgettable.
The story, performances, characters, cinematography, direction and its unflinching view of unspeakable crimes grab onto you and will not let go.
A harrowing portrayal of personal demons and professional triumph, Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson along with a superb supporting cast deliver what has to be the most compelling drama since Oz and Breaking Bad.
No spoilers here. This is must viewing by anyone who takes the craft of film making seriously.
Do not miss it. This is a pretty good show, although I wouldn't say it was quite worthy of a 9, but I'll give it an 8. This is not an action series, but it's strangely enthralling even if the plot is somewhat complicated and difficult to follow, as is the deep southern US accent. <br/><br/>The cinematography and acting is at the top of its game. The dialogue is very good and sometimes amusing, although it is a tad confusing at times. <br/><br/>Can't really say much more without a spoiler, I almost didn't watch all of this, since the first two episodes are a bit slow, but it's worth sticking at, it does get better. Not the greatest telly drama as some reviews on here have suggested, but it's still worth watching if you can keep up with the somewhat overcomplicated plot. I heard for years now how good this was, and that i should check it out so after binge-watching tons of other stuff I finally got around to it - boy what a letdown, i stuck with it till the end of season 1 and really wish I had just never even given it a chance. It wasn't because of a 'lack of action' - It was just a poor story-line, bad scripting, decent acting, but just wow - this is the first time I've even taken the time to write a review out of the literal tons of things I have watched - just so I could let you know to just not waste your time. It is utterly beyond me how anyone could have found the plot or the eight hours worth their time, and how the heck it could have such high ratings. Total garbage - a waste of two actors' good talents and a waste of my time. First off the cast is top notch. This use of big time movie stars to do TV series really raises the standard. Matthew is becoming a great actor not afraid of looking terrible. Woody is intense and just as good at drama as comedy. Oh dear Alexandra, don't think I can see you in Percy Jackson stuff anymore! Michelle Monaghan is pretty here and a bit too pretty for a small town cop's wife but never mind.<br/><br/>The two time frames are quite well differentiated they are aged appropriately with effective hair and makeup so it's not confusing.<br/><br/>The thick drawls can be a bit hard to understand. The main problem is that the plot is revealed through some of these mumblings and it makes it easy to miss plot elements. Should not have to concentrate so hard to decipher the plot.<br/><br/>So far the crimes aren't that interesting but it's early days after only 3 episodes. Hopefully it picks up. Mahershala Ali spoke his lines so poorly that his speech was inaudible! He ruined this movie for our movie club. We all agreed that he was terrible. Watch and observe masterpiece,keep u up all the ways to end Man I have to say, although I was expecting it to be good cause of the cast, this show amazing.<br/><br/>What does it for me, is mostly the acting.Cause the plot itself is nice but nothing really new or something we have not seen in Hannibal.<br/><br/>Matthew Mc. gives a stellar performance in this one, he really has starting do some great stuff in these past few years.<br/><br/>Woody is just his great self as usual.And both on-screen personalities clash with each other a lot and they complement each other pretty good.<br/><br/>It's a shame it only has 8 episodes per season atm, but I'm just happy this thing exists and that I can watch it.<br/><br/>If you are an action junkie this might not be the thing for you.Tho I would recommend this to anybody and see if it clicks with you. Love the show, i don't usually write reviews but this series makes me want to just to express how much it grows in me. It somewhat similar to Dexter but on a different scenario where the story are more focused on the Detectives. Hope to see the end of the season without losing the greatness of the show. (Oh god!, cant post review that does not contain enough lines. smh) Oh, well, The Soundtracks are good specially the Intro, it makes u wanna dance (yep dance ^_^) or just simply feel numb while listening to it and i never thought Mathew and Woody would be such a good tandem on a series.<br/><br/>PS: I Still wonder if Woody Harrelson wears a wig on this show, its looks so natural, props to him and his/her make up artist :) Really can't add much just revealing the tortured souls of two Louisiana murder detectives, reeling with a bizarre case, while dealing with partner conflict, internal and external discord as told through sequential dramatic scenes, interspersed with looking forwarding flashbacks and multiple red herrings. Matthew McGonahey just rolls hard with bitter yet provocative acting. The best thing since sliced girls. Hats off to Nick Pizzolatto who's writing breaks every cop case mold, every rule with mind-boggling thinking leading the state CID through the inner turmoil of south Louisianna. Writing equals the best of Terry Winter and Mathew Weiner. Bold, breakthrough stuff. I can't wait for the next episode as I delve deep in every scene watching each multiple times. This show is stunning and remarkable. I will start by pointing out the plain and obvious. The debut of this much discussed new television series, featuring Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson, does not seem to be covering an entirely new theme.<br/><br/>Two mismatched homicide detectives. One serial killer. Slow burning with small reveals along the way. On paper, it sounds like something you have seen before. More than once. Possibly more than fifty times before. However, this one may just avoid being another rehash.<br/><br/>And even despite how it may sound on paper, the serial killer on the loose in Louisiana, is quite the scary one. The body of his victim is found in a way that is sure to spook some viewers. I will not spoil it, or give much away, but let me just say, a deer head is involved, and it is creative.<br/><br/>What makes this special? The main focus is not the serial killer like a lot of the other shows or films. Instead, the script takes place in both 1995 and 2012. In 2012, two younger detectives, played by Michael Potts, and Tory Kittles, are interviewing the older detectives, while 1995 is shown through flashbacks. Why? We are not sure. But they are looking for exact details, claiming that the original records were all destroyed by a hurricane.<br/><br/>Point is, this takes prime focus on the actual detectives instead. Seventeen years later, Matthew McConaughey's character, Rust Cohle, is a shell of his former self. He is an alcoholic, who seems like he can fly off the handle at any time. A very fascinating, yet nihilistic man, who will make you want to keep watching.<br/><br/>You can see the toll that the case has had on him over the years. With Woody Harrelson's character, Martin Hart, he kind of seems to be the same man, but struggles at times, especially when discussing details of his former partner. The two had a falling out, yet the reveal is something we are going to have to wait for.<br/><br/>An additional reveal that the writers are keeping from us are details about Cohle's daughter, who is consistently mentioned throughout the episode. The script was well written to the point where I actually care about these reveals, and will be watching to find out.<br/><br/>Speaking of family, the only major clichÃ© is the family man, Martin, having a wife (Michelle Monaghan) who hates that he is a cop. This worrying, your never home, blah, blah, blah, wife character is one I have seen far too many times. Hopefully they have a twist or two in store that will make her a deeper character.<br/><br/>Why do I say this? Martin is a bit overly flirty at times with other women, and some scenes made my mind wonder if he is loyal. See, so much was accomplished in this thought-provoking debut. Superb acting, charismatic characters, and a compelling script has earned True Detectives a weekly watch.<br/><br/>Superpower Television Scale: 4/5 Hero on the rise<br/><br/>1.

I say to myself: "This is too much, I'm not gonna make it, I'm gonna die". A perfect ending to a perfect story delivered by a perfect cast. To say the least, I was chocked for weeks after seeing it.<br/><br/>The first season, circulating around the two policemen, life-questioning Rust Cohle (Matthew McConaghey) and American patriot Martin Hart (Woody Harrelson) is one of the best things ever shown on a Tv-screen. It is truly up there with the big giants, Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, The Wire, fighting for the top spot. It is not fair to say that McConaghey should have won the Emmy over Bryan Cranston as Walter White (Both did out of this world performances), but McConaghey should have won the Emmy. The near absolute perfect, if not absolute, performance he delivers is one of the main factors that make this show one of the best. That and the rest of the incredible cast, the story telling, cinematography, music, script-writing - you name it.<br/><br/>As well as the most imortant things mentioned above being crafted to perfection, it is also the little things that fill up the gaps left open in so many other shows and films. Attention to detail is overly overlooked, but not here, not in True Detective. From Cohle's visions to the changing accents of the antagonist, no thing is overlooked by creator Nic Pizzolatto. You can feel that he is fully in control of every scene, and nothing is ever made sloppy. It is that good you want to just be able to forget it, and rewatch it, over, and over, and over again. Or perhaps we are always watching it, over and over again?<br/><br/>When it comes to season 2, I was let down, majorly. Then again, the undefineable high standards set by the first season are immensly hard to live up to. As a stand-alone series, or perhaps a longer running Television show, or even a movie, season 2 would not feel as bad as it does now. The acting is great, but thats about where the list of good things about this season stops. The story feels like a mainstream mess, the characters are more dull and flat than we're uses to, and a truly unsatisfying ending makes this season easy to forget.<br/><br/>Now that season 3 is soon coming to an end, it seems True Detective is finally back on track, reviving all the things that we love about the show, that season 2 killed. I cannot put into words how excited I am for the upcomming finale, lets hope that we are not let down. Season 2 is just awful, do not watch it. Watch 1 then skip to 3. It's funny. When you read negative reviews of season 2, they seem like they could all be written by the same person. Is this because they have all hit on what is wrong with the season? No. It is because they hear a word they've never heard before, hop on the message boards to have the episode explained, and cling to whatever they've read. With season 1 being so popular, we knew the "in" thing to do was going to be to trash season 2. One person posts a negative review. Their review got "liked" or "+1" or W/E, so the next person comes along and makes an even more outrageously critical review to try to get more likes. You people trashing it are the same ones that were on the msg boards last season espousing and backing these outrageously complex theories about the show. Stuff about "five kings" and Marty being the killer, or Rust, or a group of rich old men who molest their oldest daughters when they're young and sacrifice them when they're old. So now you get a complex conspiracy and you hate it! The minute I see somebody say in a review "what was the point of Frank" I know they don't get it, and thus their review is worthless. When they say "the primary antagonist, Crow Mask was just some kid," or "the whole point of the show was about some kids who wanted revenge," I know the same. The show is called True Detective, and this season had an amazing True Detective. I'll give you a hint... The T. D. said "this girl's gone missing. Nobody cares. The interior's poisoned and suddenly worth billions, nobody cares?" The primary Conspiracy involving back room handshakes, power plays, and millions and millions of dollars was the point. Frank played an integral role in that central Conspiracy. The detectives thought the murder of Caspere was directly tied to the central corridor and all the shadiness that went with it. They started out investigating Caspere's murder, and also trying to tie it to corruption in Vinci and amongst corporations. For the True Detective, no matter what was going on in her life, no matter how messed up it was, she was still willing to give everything she had left to ensure that all the little people the entire corrupt machine chewed up and spit out weren't forgotten and buried under the lies and money. It might seem like nobody cared about them, but she did, and she made sure their lives mattered. Every scene in this season had a point. We got to understand who the central four were as people, the experiences that shaped their lives. The show was complex because humans are complex. And the season finale was about as perfect yet tragic as it could have been. Once again, great writing by Pizollato. He is a master at creating beautifully flawed characters. It's just a shame that most people can't see below the surface. PS - I'm sure I've made grammar or spelling mistakes in here somewhere. Instead of attacking me there, why don't you attack me with examples of "silly dialogue" or "terrible writing"? Bear in mind, I will provide counter examples from season 1. Finally! It ended. But then again, as Rust adequately put it - nothing ever ends...<br/><br/>The main heroes finally went all the way. Some viewers expected greater confrontation. Even an unexpected transformation in our main characters. And it has been an insightful trip for us all, so I guess it is OK to have such expectations. As a big fan of the series I felt satisfaction at the end of episode 8. "Form and Void" was a masterful ending of this cinematography class by Pizzolatto and Fukunaga. For me this story was never about who is the evil man, or the ancient organization. After the "shooting" from episode 5, I understood that this TV show was not so much about the actual detective work, but more about a the personal journey of the two main characters. Imagery, sound and music - that is the Form. The narrative monologues and dialogs - that is the Void. This show gave us interesting hints about our own role as viewers. It is interesting to see how an acknowledged writer like Pizzolatto can lure in many viewers and make them fans, using techniques, that build up suspense and subconscious interest. And then he uses this energy to interpret ideas which have much deeper roots - storytelling as a metaphysically bound metaphor. <br/><br/>All is connected and we are all part of this world. A world which defines itself between light and darkness. The loan from Allan Moore at the end was pretty much the best part of the final episode. Rust breaking down and crying, reaching the human core which is deep inside every one of us. It was really touching to experience this symbolic journey through eerie landscapes, vivid characters and subtle music. One of the most important experiences for me was the reassuring message about the human nature - that nobody can see and act beyond his own choices and lifespan. A powerful truth which was carefully constructed throughout the whole season. <br/><br/>So I would like to peacefully thank for all the artistic talent embodied in this masterpiece of television! And let us hope that the second season will be even better! By Watching for 15min of pilot i can tell this is a hit !..This show has the excellent writing,plot and the direction.This show has got some real talent that you don't wanna miss!!.<br/><br/>The most important thing is that it has got such a brilliant cast with Michelle monaghan and the two detective specially Matthew McConaughey!! Just watch the pilot and then you are hooked to this show.Till now this show is the biggest hit of 2014.<br/><br/>This show is certainly not for the action loving fans but it is definitely recommended for thriller and suspense loving fans.This show has got every aspect to entertain you.But if you want a comedy and funny light crime show then you watch " The mentalist" because this one is some dark booming cinema !!<br/><br/>Especially for the one who watches "Sherlock" You definitely watch this show and see the real talent . Unlike Sherlock who just solve half of the case by looking at that person lol ..believe me this show is not like that. This show is much much better than that with a real potential to beat other detective shows out there. Till now this show is a Hit with a capital H !!!!<br/><br/>If you really want some great dialogue and a stupendous script with a character driven story ..this is the show you are looking for !! i was caught by the hype and made my self sit through 3 episodes till i just broke. its is some kind of "The Killing" style thriller/drama with a very similar score by the way, trying to look very intelligent but actually succeeds to be slow and pointless. in this time and age when there are so many good shows: Breaking Bad, Justified, to name few it is beyond me how this rating and hype ever happened. its not complicated and deep its just damn boring. don't get me wrong, the acting and the technical side is just superb and matthew mcconaughey & woody harrelson deserve every bit of praise they get, DP is great editing etc. but the one thing that makes a movie or a show pop out is the story and theme, and this plays out just so full of self importance its actually pretty shallow,i know the fans will bash me like hell but its the plain truth guys. I just finished season 3, it was very disappointing, I consider it a waste of time S1 - 10/10 - Instant classic.<br/><br/>S2 - 8.7/10 - Flawed but harrowingly fantastic.<br/><br/>S3 - 9.5/10 - Show Of The year Even the opening credits at the start are good! It oozes quality and depth of storyline. The acting is first class as is the makeup and casting deserve a mention.
I started with the 3rd series and I am now watching the 1st series which is maybe even slightly better but very slightly. Season 3 is the season 2 we always wanted ! Awsome acting the frist 2 epsiodes Are great looking forward for episode 3!<br/><br/>Great work HBO ! I think that the short-series is the best for format for telling a story like True Detective. It gives enough time to go through the story and its characters in its depth but still not long that we lose the focus. The concept of using multiple timelines spanning over 17 years is a stroke of brilliance. The characters evolve both visually and spiritually during these years. The lead casts are perfect I couldn't think of anyone better who could do these roles. Their acting is top-notch. The direction of the series is so good that we get the Gothic psychedelic feel throughout the series. The soundtracks and score including "Far From Any Road" and "Young Men Dead" give the series an unique touch.<br/><br/>The nice little touches like the VFX shots and the single-shot scene is what make this series unforgettable. There is perfection is all these shots. I wish there had been more back-story about Rust and how he became like this. The contrast between the lead character is what made the series this successful. I wish Nic Pizzolatto and HBO bring out more seasons of this. This is one of those shows that seems to become part of your life and you don't want it to end, it was the best show I have ever seen period outstanding acting and story it kept me interested until the very end, just spectacular. I highly recommend it to be watched you will be pulled into the amazing performance's of Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson. The writing and the roles are just so exquisite and complex I was just captivated by the entire season. It did not bore me what so ever each character was so driven in what they were acting upon at times I forgot this was just a TV show, yes it was that good so grab some popcorn sit down with your undivided attention and enjoy this great series. True Detective. I am a big fan of some previous titles seen first on HBO like OZ, Deadwood, Sopranos, The Wire, Band of Brothers. I am happy in 2014 HBO kept it's high standards with True Detective.<br/><br/>I will surely watch this mini series again! After the fifth episode I was convinced that Tuttle was the criminal and I had a bit of a disappointment from this point of view at the end. I was hoping for someone with more weight, figuratively speaking. As a flaw to this, otherwise perfect series, was the feeling that I had at the end(starting with the house painted in green discovery). I felt it was a little bit rushed from this point on. One more episode, focusing more on the character of the criminal; at least show more of his manipulative ways, his charismatic and twisted personality and mind, would've been welcomed by the viewers, for sure!<br/><br/>The biggest plus for this series, for me was the atmosphere created, build-up of the intensity and the memorable personality of Detective Rust Chole. The epiphany that he had when he was in a coma(the fact that he felt the presence of other realm past beyond our on) stole some charm from him. This I saw in his last remark: the fact that the light is winning. I liked him more when he was and obsessive pessimist, bad at parties. At least that is the real Rust we know and care about, and listen to. Other Rust is BS.<br/><br/>In the end I like to point out a fact that this series took up as a fact something I don't agree with. It presented to us the idea that drugs pulls out the worst from all human beings. See the microwave-baby incident for this. I don't believe that this is the case. If a individual has his thoughts stained with bad intentions, the drug will broke some restrains that he has. But if he is normal, psychologicaly speaking, the drug will only enhance his personality traits that are already known but are a little dim in the rest of the time. What I want to say is that drugs are only an enhancer, like a catalyst in a chemical reaction, not a producer of evil like this series wanted us to believe, at least this was my feeling. Television show of quality rarely seen. Wish more T.V. were of this caliber.<br/><br/>Storyline draws one in with a lot of mystery and intrigue. I was never sure of the villain until the story allowed that identity to be revealed.<br/><br/>Acting by Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey, is superb. Extra enjoyment that McConaughey is eye candy.<br/><br/>Setting in the bayou's brings a spookiness which enhances the grisly plot. Old decrepit buildings with encroaching greenery adds to the creepiness of the story. There is not the common reliance, as do many copy shows, where mood is created by filming in dark rooms with flashlights, leaving folks thinking "why wouldn't smart cops just turn on the lights?"<br/><br/>Characters are memorable,believable and unique.<br/><br/>Can't wait until next season! Very cerebral yet very troubled and eccentric Texas police detective Rust Cohle (Mathew McConaughey is sent to small town Louisiana after years of grueling undercover work in his home state. He is partnered up with conventional but exceedingly dumb local cop Marty Hart (Woody Harrelson) who is more diplomatic and occasionally helpful but not half the cop that Rust is.<br/><br/>Three months in to their partnership they are assigned a grisly murder case of a teen girl. Marty has the experience to fill out the reports without feeling sick. Rust however has different experience and an obsessiveness about details he notices that others miss or regard as inconsequential. He senses that the murder is overlooked residue, a carelessly discarded part of a greater criminal enterprise. He is right.<br/><br/>It is a conspiracy that has thrived long term due mainly to the caution of the powerful perpetrators, the low standing of the victims and the incompetence/lack of resources of small town law enforcement. A linear-thinking cop like Marty - focused on his family and on juggling various mistresses will offer requisite attention to a case during working hours but never solve anything complex. He is in it for the paycheck, the perqs, the minor plaudits and the pension.<br/><br/>A 'True Detective' like Rust - a naturally gifted (or cursed) analytical thinker with learned abilities gleaned via years in various facets of law enforcement will see and understand things most won't. Rust shouldn't be here on this case but because he is it has a chance of being solved. Because he has little apparent concern for his own well-being he has a chance to serve a form of justice that the system can't.<br/><br/>This exploration of the dark recesses of American society below the Mason-Dixon Line in the 1990s reaches and maintains a gritty intensity throughout. The even pacing is devastatingly effective. Nothing seems forced. It all appears to develop naturally. There is two kinds of people who starts to watch this series, first who is interested to casts, second groups are HBO channel's Fans. This is True detective's first impression and let's forget about these. We are living 2014 now, watching series from past doesn't amuse us anymore, even those who has started to show in 2010, 2009, they are old, their cornerstone did set couple of years ago. My opinion seems stupid? watch best series in the past right now, you'll figure out what I'm talking about. Human's brain is too powerful for making things understood and stereotyped. Watch True Detective if you care about being modern even in entertaining yourself. I like the camera's movement which is the Next-Gen of something like paranormal activity's style when it came out and other times it's like super solid recording full of art and passion, casting is super for a series which is supposed to be weaker than Movies, everything is novel, And yeah, this is us moving the generations not them, they are making profit, but we are their audience, we decide when we should go the next generation. when i first saw the trailer,i knew it was gonna be a good show because of the casting but i wasn't familiar with Nic Pizzolato's work.so i didn't know what to expect.after i watched the first episode i was dazzled by extraordinary writing and flawless acting of all the cast specially Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson.The two main characters have very different disposition and traits which i think is very amusing.the plot of the movie is quite dark and mysterious which makes it very interesting and thought-provoking.i have seen four episodes so far and it's getting better and more interesting and addictive by episode.after watching the fourth episode i have to acknowledge Cari Jojo Fukunaga's directing because of the last 10 minutes of episode four,it was just brilliant.i recommend this to one's that like complicated crime plot. This is absolutely the best thing I've seen on TV since Breaking Bad. That's extremely high praise in my book. as I was literally addicted to that show for it's entire run. I feel the same kind of "jonze" waiting for episodes of this show to premier.<br/><br/>For a very long time I wasn't much of a Matthew McConaughey fan. I don't really know why, I just wasn't. I recently saw him in Dallas Buyers Club and I totally changed my mind. He was fantastic in that, and he's fantastic in this. Woody Harelson is as well. <br/><br/>I'm so glad I decided to give this a shot. If you are a fan of shows like The Wire, BB, and The Killing, YOU WILL LIKE THIS SHOW. I won't watch season 2 and I am a little upset with how season 3 ended. I watched that first and now I'm on season 1 which is depressing and sad but still phenomenal What an awesome start...right up to the 5th episode and then it just became about dementia and demented...I get what the writers were trying to portray but you didnt pull it off..it felt like a bad hangover over a night of making sense to the world...sorry but it had more potential Season 1 was great. Season 2 was garbage. Season 3 was promising until the finale, which was slow, boring and ruined the season. It's a real shame because I enjoyed the first seven episodes of season 3, but now feel like I just wasted my time watching it. S1 was excellent, couldn't see how it could be equaled and yet S2 stands up very well. Ending was predictable but very sad nonetheless. So looking forward to S3 just finished watching True Detective, both seasons. SO. GOOD. Both of them.<br/><br/>First off, McConaughy's performance- holy crow. Amazing. He really portrays a man of the absurdist philosophy tinged with a bit of nihilism so very well. Harrelson is always excellent, but I think the choice of casting him as Hart and McConaughy as Cohle was a good decision. Some critics say that the writer relies too heavily on religion to be the backbone, and while i can't say I disagree, it still works. I only wish they had the opportunity to delve a little more into this particular practice- be it fictional or not. I recognized the references right away, and i am curious where the writer came across them.<br/><br/>The second season got critical reviews from viewers and critics, saying it wasn't as good. I believe this to be an unfair assessment. The characters are different, motivated by different things, and living in a different world (if you think backwater Louisiana is the same place as L.A, then you've never been to either). So it would make sense that the characters are written and portrayed differently. As intriguing as both Hart and Cohle were, to have men like that in the second season would be an incredible disconnect. <br/><br/>One common thread through all the main characters is their internal conflict. These are people living in the confusion that is themselves,that began with some act of conflict, some decision. And instead of dealing with that, they've each built upon that conflict, creating layer after layer of confusion. By the time we meet Farrell and McAdams, they have no idea who they are as a person. One of the criticism is the the confusing dialogue but again,I think that is merely a tool used to reflect the confusion of both the situation that is happening- everything is falling apart, but no one is sure why - and to reflect the internal confusion of the characters. As things begin to clarify in the situation, so does the dialogue, and the people.<br/><br/>Farrell, McAdams, and Kitsch all do an excellent job of portraying people who are in deep personal confusion and denial of that confusion.Vaughn plays a gangster we love. This is one of those shows where you desperately want the not so good guys, the guys who aren't as bad as the bad guys, but aren't good either, to win. <br/><br/>I have one other theory as to why critics and viewers didn't like this season, and that is the ending. By the time we get there we are rooting for Farrell and Vaughn, it's a sore way to end characters we are invested in.<br/><br/>In both season the peripheral characters are just as compelling as the main ones.Glen Fleshler as Childress was perfectly creepy while being seemingly innocuous.And Kelly Reilly as Jordan Semyon was a silent bad ass in her own right as a supportive wife who is no one's fool.<br/><br/>If there is one unifying thread through these two seasons, I would wager it is in Nic Pizzolatto's own brand of absurdist-meets- nihilism philosophy that comes through in the characters, whether he is aware of it or not. There is an awareness of the futility of it all in the eyes of Velcoro and Bezzerides. To quote Queen, "Nothing really matters, anyone can see. Nothing really matters to me" is the look in their eyes. Through the cluster f**k of their situation they do find meaning,if only in each other. And while Hart doesn't suffer the same philosophical malaise, the same can be said for Cohle in Season 1.<br/><br/>I for one can not wait to see what comes in Season 3.<br/><br/>Oh, and T Bone Burnett's scoring is just perfect. I will be buying these soundtracks. Season 2 began on shaky ground. It was hard to follow...hard to accept Colin Farrell and Vince Vaughn in their roles because of their previous work ( and off-screen persona's ) ...It took a while to settle in and understand the story. By the 4th episode I was almost losing interest as were most people I talked to about it. There was disappointment, probably caused by the huge expectations created by Season 1. It would be interesting to know what it would be like to see Season 2 with no knowledge of season 1...I guess we'll never know...but it was hard to watch without constant comparisons and disappointment....BUT THEN... suddenly...somehow...roughly around episode 5 the whole thing turned around! I was hooked...and couldn't wait to find out what would happen next! I was finally somehow drawn into the characters and excited about the story again and was eager to follow. I guess to try and match the success of season one would be an impossibility since it is often refereed to as the best thing that has EVER happened to TV. I don't know why they didn't use the same director from season 1 who created the most memorable and universally praised episode( E4 )He was only a producer on this one I feel he should have directed the whole thing. Very much looking forward to Season 3.. Season 1: 10/10 Perfection. The varied time-lines, the general feeling of corruption, the dark atmosphere, the grit and grime and swampy heat practically wafts of the TV screen. McConaughey's character is a tortured soul, socially stunted and hard to like. A nihilistic philosopher, a brilliant and totally dedicated detective. Harrelson plays a deeply flawed husband and good ol' boy who sees MM's abilities and commits himself to the cause. The two characters wrangle and wrong each other, but their belief in each other and their drive to get the perp eventually outweighs everything else. This show sucks you in and spits out your bones. Visceral... dark... amazing.------Season 2: 7/10 More of an ensemble cast of good, bad, and ugly. The politics and gangs and corruption of the whole system is palpable in this season. The detectives are fighting the system, but that system is made up of parts large and small, and of individuals... each with their own agenda. Very well plotted and logically thought out, but ultimately less satisfying than season 1. Because there never really is a satisfying victory when you fight a corrupt system... you never get the entire cancer... Like the end of a western where the bad guys are so numerous that you know you can never take them all down before they get you. In the vast sea of shows and movies around, I can say for sure this show is the purest projection of human deepest feelings and thoughts and for sure has the best acting and cinematography seen in a TV series so far! after watching the whole season at a go, all I had to do was to start over and enjoy it again. Acting is at it's highest level, Matthew McConaughey is a class, needless to say anything about Woody. The chemistry between them is fantastic. Dark and Gloomy atmosphere is all over the place but you can always feel the warmth of hope. Fluidity of the story and point of view is so vivid and smart that you don't feel bored after listening to long conversations between the Detectives. I recommend it to everyone who wants to grasp something after the show. Absolutely a Masterpiece. This is the best series i've ever seen. A Mc Conaughey in state of grace. I already loved him in his recent movies and in this series, in my opinion, he finds a way to summarize his previous roles. Woody Harrelson? i loved him in NBK but that role was very simple in confront to this one. It's very difficult to be next a character like Detective Rust Cohle. His capacity of being a sort of "stupid" or superficial man is not easy to mix with an other aspect: the capacity of being a good detective that can have commitment and intuitions. In fact: surely not a stereotype! Obviously every possibility for this actors is given by a script very well written with the right mix of action, drama and philosophy. A mention for Alexandra Daddario: best body ever seen. This is without question one of the best things I have ever seen on television. The performances by Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey are absolutely flawless. But where this show really gets its wheels is the writing; Nic Pizzolatto manages to make the main story and theme as well as the interaction between Rust and Marty exceptionally engaging. Do yourself a favor: watch the moody, well done (and Emmy winning) intro all the way through each time you view an episode. It sets the mood in a way I have yet to see in another show.<br/><br/>On a related note, before anyone jumps to any conclusions about the casting in Season 2, remember that some of the same observations could arguably have been made about certain casting in Season 1, and everyone hits it out of the park. Sometimes the most unexpected casting can lead to the most exceptional performances. It's best to try and avoid comparison and allow Season 2 to speak for itself. I'm excited to see where the show goes from here. It is nice to see a TV series which such caliber and brutal reality to a point where we question ourselves in the end. In this show, we have two detectives investigating serial murders and with every clue they follow, they always seem to reach a dead end. Every cop show I have seen such as Law & Order, Homicide:Life on the Street, or even Blue Bloods, they always end with the mystery solved. This mystery is inside an enigma in which the two detectives are being interviewed 20 years later about it and wonder why is it happening again? First we have Det. Rust Cohle (Matthew McConaughey) who is an introvert trying to blend with the police force but disturbs everyone with his views of the world. We also have Det. Marty Hart (Woody Harrelson), who is the opposite who is likable, loving husband and father of two daughters, and has a taste for cheating on his wife to mask his depression and sadness of the case he is investigating. McConaughey delivers another great performance with a combination of mystery and awe. He delves deep into character to a point where you forget the bad movies he was in like Fool's Gold or Surfer Dude. You feel a sense of sorrow and despair with this character when he cares about his job but not about his own sanity or happiness. Harrelson is just the same, giving another great performance with realism and despair of his own reality. Not since The Messenger, did I see Harrelson in such a performance. He shows us a man who is letting a case so horrific and so disturbing that he is letting it interfere with his family life. His character wants so much of the simple life that he is masking the reality of his choices in order to feel a sense of calmness in his home. In reality, he is letting his affair and job undermine his own reality. With a sense of reality and great shots of Louisiana, this show stands alone as one of the best series ever come from HBO. Mystery centers us into this show and awe is what we receive. I recommend this show with the highest honors. In this show, there is much more place for character development and mood than actual plot. The two black detectives who interview the main cast in the first half of the show are nothing more than spectators to the story, serving to deliver Cohle's rants and Marty's sexual escapades. The main women in the show are all surrounding Marty, between his mistresses, his wife and his kids. The only female character relevant to the plot is his wife, who sleeps with Cohle in the least surprising love triangle ever seen on TV while also serving as a plot device to create a chasm between the two main characters.<br/><br/>The show in the end is only about the two main detectives. Even the villains, which are supposed to drive the plot as we are supposed to be excited that they get catch, are only obstacles in Cohle and Marty's philosophical journey of Extra marital sex and nihilism. The bearded biker is a notable weak actor in this series, also suffering from Neanderthal dialogue with an awful touch of exposition when he says "Do this for me and I'll get you your chemist". This part is dreadful in particular because the character makes the crime of knowing too much of the main plot when he's not supposed to know anything about it. Here again, the biker is only a self-aware 4rth wall-breaking plot device, but here it doesn't even develop Cohle's character.<br/><br/>The end of the series saves nothing. Between the weird jungle labyrinth dungeon, incest and fat, the main villain is more confusing and pathetic than horrifying. Another character that only serves as a plot device to the show's main revelation, that is that Cohle's daughter and father were sensed by him in a "darkness" which he felt because of the near-fatal blow he got by the fat yellow king green eared spaghetti monster. This is a major character change from atheist to believing in the supernatural, although we had an hint when he first said "do you believe in ghosts" after seeing a little girl at the start of the series. Also, the show makes the faux-pas of not resolving the "conspiracy" aspect of the crime, that implied that the governor and his family, and a whole lot of masked people, were also part of a big cult. In the end the cult is nowhere to be seen and only the fat weirdo gets caught.<br/><br/>To conclude, the show is all about its two main characters. If you don't like them, you won't like the show. I found Cohle to be confusing, claiming to be both an atheist while making paranormal "circle of life that never ends" remarks to whoever wants to ear it. Marty is mostly interested in having sex, and when he's not he's there to be angry at Cohle while helping him as a sidekick. If the show was based on making another Sherlock Holmes inspired thing, Marty fails at being a likable human where Watson triumphed in most adaptation, and Cohle is simply too introverted and down right crazy to be a likable eccentric like Sherlock or House. However, I kept watching because there is definitive production value, and I always had hope that a twist would save the show. It never came. Now I am at loss, what the hell can they up in season 2 that can possibly match season 1!! Right from casting, screen play, writing and every department one can imagine this series will not disappoint. This is no run of the mill stuff, draws you into the story. Very strong characters, true to the name "True Detectives".<br/><br/>The cop story has just got into undiscovered territory. Certainly some can find it a bit slow paced but for those who consider themselves fans of Mystery genre, this is just the thing to get you going. Stellar performances from Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson as expected. The dialogues, the opening credit all weave magic that you should not miss! Due to my little space of free time I have and much more little time to go to the movies, I started to focus on TV series to still follow one of my biggest hobbies: watching good films. In January I followed the release of "True Detective" that received advance praise in the web by almost all relevant online platforms dealing with the entertainment industry. Since then I fixed on the release date for the DVD in Germany and now I finally could sit back and watch.<br/><br/>What I saw after eight episodes - I can sum up into one line: This is art! I cannot remember that I have ever seen a mini series dealing with such a high artistic visual concept and a scriptwriting that keeps you hanging on at the words of the two protagonists although this is quite a challenge for someone like me - not being a native American-English speaker. And I am honest: It sometimes took me endurance. The opening already announces that "True Detective" is a visual highly acclaimed artwork but not for the visuals itself but to underline the whole story and the characters throughout the entire episodes. This already is a good reason to watch it more than one time.<br/><br/>The story itself gets the time it needs to fully develop and make it understandable for me why the protagonists act the way they act or why the storytelling jumps from the past to the presence and vice versa. All fits together. The acting is tremendous - so intense that I sometimes thought by myself these two guys are real flesh and blood - more a kind of documentary than a fictional story. This is art again! I do not have anything to grumble about - not even about the story some media put their criticism on because it was not really new. Doesn't matter anyway: I am sure "True Detective" already set the standards for a new kind of artistic movie-making and storytelling for future productions - probably to go far enough to having decisive influence on future film making for movies on the big screen.<br/><br/>Magnificent and with formative influence on how I will watch a movie or series in the future. At the moment for me it is quite difficult to imagine that there could be a season 2. This show is comparable to Breaking Bad. Yes. It's that good. Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey are unbelievable in this show. MM's acting in this show is some of the best I've ever seen, and I'm a movie/TV show junkie, so I've seen a lot. The way Pizzolatto develops his characters throughout this series is perfect. Just the first season of this show blew me away and I consider it to be almost as good if not as good as the legendary Breaking Bad. Unfortunately I'm not so sure how the seasons to come of True Detective will be because I don't know how they could top the first season. But this first season is just outstandingly amazing. If you haven't yet seen this first season, that should be the next thing written on your "to-do" list. I recommend this to anyone who likes gritty, harsh drama and suspense. The first three episodes are slow, but they set up the rest of the show flawlessly and you'll be on the edge of your seat from the fourth episode all the way to the eighth and final episode. This show is amazing, and it's first season is definitely one that'll go down in history as one of the best TV show seasons of all time. Now we just have to see if the second season can live up to the incredibly high standards that the first season set. But seriously, if you haven't seen this show, watch it. Now. Right now. This show has certainly taken television shows to the next level such and so that it can be compared to be an 8 hour movie with intense storyline. The leads played by Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson has pretty much out done the main storyline,that was supposed to be the murder mystery.The later played the sub-plot,while the most amazing aspect of the show was the dialogue's between those two lead actors,and every time they had a chat or discussion,they almost enthralled the screen with their presence.With Matthew McConaughey portraying the troubled character,who is undergoing intense soul searching and thus questions every clichÃ© and norms of the society in a justified way,each with his brilliant/philosophical one liners and hard hitting dialogues. Even the two leads carried out the accents suiting the southern dialect remarkably. As for the crime investigation was concerned it took its main course over a period of years which took many aspects of the concerned society and its dark sides,which showcased major issues like drugs,prostitution,church,faith,power.This plot and the combined movie like cinematography,with outstanding acting and screenplay makes it a front runner in modern day television. Thus with the season concluding with 8 episodes, this could be a challenge for the makers to bring forth the next season with a different storyline with different set of actors to match up to the aura created by Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson.The show is for mature viewers and has its own class,which is certainly genre re-defining,that had became very monotonous with the same age old detective plots. Wow! This show will leave you in suspense and each episode assures nothing short of pure cinematic satisfaction, the fourth episode of season 1 is indeed a great example of that. This show is a dramatic masterpiece in the truest sense. I feel like each scene, each cut and each line was well thought out. There is indeed no signs of exerting only half the effort. The chosen setting of rural, countryside of Louisiana only amplifies the eerie ambiance of the show. The two different time frames make it all the more complex but it does not overdo itself. The detective busywork is completely believable. The acting provided by both Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey will leave you enthralled. Truly immaculate casting and production! This can only be described as a masterpiece, a gem amongst detective TV shows, already competing with "The Wire".. and to think it is only now getting into its second season.<br/><br/>I feel like a lot of people might not appreciate it at first, as is always the case with media. How many times has this happened?.. A picture comes out, receives average reviews, and only within a decade (sometimes two) is it recognised as the brilliant work of art that it is.<br/><br/>Just when I had given up hope on HBO, it raises the bar yet again, with a fantastically haunting, beautiful, genre defining piece of art.. bravo. What truly sets True Detective apart from other detective shows is that it does not make any attempt to hide its dark theme and message. There's no comic relief, there's no love scenes that aren't there to add to the plot, and there isn't any unnecessary violence. My opinion of true detective was that it was a deep inquiry into the evil that man is capable of, what his motivations are, and the effects it has on others. Other television shows attempt to shield viewers from this because it might turn many away, but that is not the case at all with True Detective. If Rust and Marty were always cracking jokes and making light of the situations, this would just be another detective show, perhaps with darker crimes, but in most areas about the same as other shows. Instead, whenever there is a need for dialogue, its turned into a deep reflection on the human soul and mind. Rust frequently questions why it is worth living and what the meaning of life really is, but it is done is such a way that it appears completely natural to the show and is in no way offsetting. Marty is more down to earth and balances out Rusts disconnection from society.The show begins with Marty and Rust telling the story of how they tracked a serial killer in Louisiana, but by the end of season 1, we have been told that this evil is much deeper than just the killer, and may even penetrate into the highest reaches of Louisianan society. The show is always entertaining because it is always causing you to think, reflect, and wonder. This show is not very easy viewing, because of its dark plot, but is nonetheless very worthwhile and will bring you to ponder your own life. <br/><br/>10/10 True Detective stars Matthew McConaughey, Woody Harrelson, Michael Potts, Troy Kittles and Michelle Monaghan. It is mainly the story of two detectives' lives over the course of 17 years, and how one case continues to catch up wit them. True Detective is exactly what you want from a drama show- a great setup with four- dimensional characters and a memorable atmosphere, a thrilling and incredibly dramatic second act, and an awesome pay off. The directing is great- Cary Fukunaga perfectly knows how to elevate the material given to him. The writing is simply perfect, as is the acting. As this is written before awards season, I'm just hoping this show sweeps every category it is nominated for, particularly McConaughey. HIs performance is a worthy model of spot-on acting. True Detective is a show worthy of all its praise and more, and it is a series everyone with a taste for good television should watch Don't have HBO, so we're watching this on DVD. Have watched all but the last episode, can't wait to finish. The acting in this show is superior. Matthew McConahay just blows me away. He is so dark and brooding, and so mysterious. You wonder what is driving him throughout the season. Is it what happened to his daughter, his addictions, or is he actually part of the cover-up? But, whatever it is, his expressions, his eyes, his mannerisms, and voice inflection all come together to play a very troubled spirit. Woody Harrelson is equally superb as his partner. It is truly great drama watching these two troubled spirits dealing with a very gruesome case. Can't wait to see the final show in season two. I am also very impressed with the writing. We are constantly being teased by surprising twists, and an amazing intertwining of facts. The nearly 20 year span of time is truly amazing. It's astonishing how young they have made the actors look for the scenes that take place in 1995. Woody Harrelson looks like he just stepped off the set of Cheers. Just finished the 8th episode, came to the end and feel like write a few words on this subject as it deserves them. What to tell about it what hasn't yet been written? Obviously we have to appreciate the quality of all the main categories that this series comprises.<br/><br/>We could see the astounding pictures, camera, so called "breathtaking scenes", listen to remarkable phrases, music and observe the spectacular performances of main actors. An Oscar for M. McConaughey is just a plaster for what he had shown. Detective story shifted to higher levels of philosophy, religion, meaning of life, drama of life, a question of morality, responsibility and of being a true detective <br/><br/>It is not often, we get such a chance to see a piece like this. Plot is simple, cops chasing villains. As usual, but yet the A.S. Exupéry said: "It seems that perfection is attained, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing more to take away." We have to admit it might not be perfect but it was close, just something over and above as enough is sometimes too much.<br/><br/>Must see? Just if you still feel safe in this world. Before watching first episode I was nearly convinced that I won't reach the end because I thought it would bore me. This is not my favourite genre and perhaps a tag "mystery" dragged me to it.<br/><br/>What I was fascinated about were the relationships between characters. There were small things and behaviours, but building them throughout the following episodes and in the interesting way of narration made them real. Harrelson and McConaughey did a damn good job! I say that and I'm sure of it, and it's a simple reason for me to say that: I never was a fan of detective fiction nor did I was particularly interested in movies these actors were involved into. And here I found myself immersed into the mood and characters' actions and thinking that were not exactly joined with the main case (not always to be exact).<br/><br/>This is a raw crime story with a true gloomy, almost lovecraftian atmosphere accompanied by slow yet somehow erratic music. Season 2nd won't be anything like it, imho. But maybe the shorter series, the better we recall it. I think I will rewatch this season once again sometime soon. Definitely worth it.<br/><br/>Yet I was somehow disappointed in the finale, solid but I expected something more... I don't know... mystical? Smart? Something more surprising, definitely. From the clues we all got whole picture in the end. I like being surprised, and this I was deprived of. All this symbolism that gave me chills earlier disappeared in the eight episode and I believe some major plots weren't finished and clarified.<br/><br/>I won't say that this is a must-watch. From some scenes and dialogues emerge problems to think about. The main case can be put aside for more focus on philosophical questions and intellectual mind games. Perhaps this quality of the show made it so enjoyable. Self indulgent and slow. What's the matter, can't tell a story in a reasonable amount of time? Pandering to the lower vices? I'm NO prude, but I'm tired of the gratuitous vulgarity that passes for good script. This isn't high art. <br/><br/>Probably not fair to compare, but Breaking Bad at least had interesting episodes that kept the viewer coming back next week, all without glacially paced plot development. Get to the point! And by the way, Matthew M. should stop reading his own promotional press releases. He's not a thespian. Overarching moodiness does not pass for character development. Another good TV series destroyed by bad casting of the protagonist. I am now into the second episode and I am very impressed with this vehicle that Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson have attached themselves to. I have always been a big fan of both of these actors and can see some incredible chemistry between the two as the story unfolds and more is revealed in regards to their characters personalities and the lives that revolve around them.<br/><br/>I look forward to seeing how this series plays out and what other projects Matthew and Woody can team up together on.<br/><br/>HBO really is the home of some of my favorite shows, Boardwalk Empire, True Blood, Game of Thrones and now...looking like I am going to add True Detective to this list.<br/><br/>Thank you HBO. Everything about this new series is very interesting. However, the presence of one Matthew McConaughey nearly destroys it. Anyone who was ever born in or raised in the South will understand just what a terrible actor he is. While I am trying to enjoy this rather retro-styled, untamed crime drama is promising, the presence of this actor in my view nearly destroys the show entirely. That is has received such a high IMDb rating is not surprising, but it does seem worrisome that so many people can watch a "performance" by Matthew McConaughey and actually say they have enjoyed it. I find it agony. He tries to play a clever, "intellectual" detective, but it comes off as plastic, posed and artificial. His little stylistic antics, like the way he smokes a cigarette like it is a joint, are almost painful in their artless adoption. We also find out that he, along with Woody Harrelson are executive producers, and this explains in part why Matthew McConaughey is especially terrible in this part. Under a strong director, many of his more offensive and artless efforts can be channeled, but as a boss, we see him granting himself a license to be "innovative", and these efforts in fact approach nausea. While the story of two small town southern detectives investigating a gruesome murder is well written, and the supporting cast is sterling, Matthew McConaughey spoils it for me. He is perhaps one of the most over-rated actors in my lifetime. Guys really, 9.3 rating for this??? <br/><br/>Are you all crazy? Admittedly, this series is well crafted with good actors but overall garrulous and boring, boring boring. Of course the last decade messed us up with action filled movies and series but TRUE DETECTIVE works like an overdose of sleeping pills... In spite of several attempts I could't get thru the whole season, the biggest disappointment in years!<br/><br/>Best of all are the opening credits and the soundtrack, but that can't help over the uninspired story...<br/><br/>Not far as intense and breathtaking as HANNIBAL with the furious Mads Mikkelsen! ... which is why I'm way more pro S3 than a lot of folks because it has a lot to say. But if you demand the band to follow its first album with the same like before they're going to bulk because they want to say something different. S3 did that in spades. Its script was by far tightest I've ever heard from my side of the monitor. The wise clipped sentences allowed me to listen as sharply as I was invited to watch with a scrutiny only the three main actors demand. How does he write like that? Oh, right, he's fro Louisiana where they actually talk like that... well, sort of I suspect.<br/><br/>S3 is getting praise because NP pretty much returned to form. It's good, but it isn't S2. S2 thus far is my personal favorite. I like different. Same is like how it is when one settles, not that NP settled, but he did show up for bits at the end to re-encourage folks to see beyond what they see. To quote him from elsewhere, "There is deep down power in the solitary man." Keep doin' it. Do it afraid. This would probably have been great if I could have understood half the dialogue. As it was the sound was so muffled and the actors mumbled so much that I gave up after one episode. I have just finished watching season 1, this was my second attempt as I tried to watch it when it was originally aired however I found it boring and couldn't stick with it. Anyway this time a persevered. The show got off to a painfully slow start I found the first 3 episodes slow going and it wasn't until the 4th episode that the story actually got going. I found the story line very predictable I was waiting for a twist which never happened. Reading the reviews of season 2 I'm not sure if I will continue. 2014's masterpiece appointment viewing is 2015's mess of hot garbage, coming to you from the exact same creator and writer, via different directors and actors. The main issue here appears to come from the over-confidence after the rave reviews for Season 1: writer Nic Pizzolato has indulged his every whim, spouting such a stream of pretentious nonsense, with about 20 characters too many and enough incomprehensible exposition to sink a James Bond movie. Season 1 had a moody brilliance, a perfect unity, with every episode directed by the same man who managed to get the kind of performance from McConnaghey that makes you forget his "persona" and see him in a brand new light. The story was also a riveting mystery. In season 2 there's no emerging scene of a single thing we're supposed to care about. The moment the season definitively jumped the shark for me was when they pulled a complete cheat, threatening to kill a character, then just doubling back completely. Just a total lack of bravado, this season. I'd say fingers crossed for next year but Idon't know if I'd bother again. Gave up after like 5 episodes, couldn't take all the mock philosophical trash. <br/><br/>So my 5/10 is a 10/10 for season 1 and a 0/10 for season 2. <br/><br/>Stick with S1. Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>This intense, dark and gripping drama series began kinda slow to me, first two episodes weren't that good, because probably i have not expected such a storytelling and was "pose" from other TV shows. But then the things started to get better and better with every scene, i got the pace, the moody atmosphere and "True Detective" started to shine. I loved both lead characters, especially Detective Rust Cohle - his ideas about infinity and deep space were mesmerizing (won't going to expand here, but some similar ideas had crossed my mind in my life, but never didn't expect to see hear them on screen, said by Matthew McConaughey). And what a performance it is by Matthew McConaughey, he has just won Oscar, and many more shining award will come to him after "True Detective" - it is a person, not a character - his speech at the end about death, was so deep, so warm - i haven't heard more beautiful expression about death in my life.<br/><br/>Overall, this is not your typical cop drama, it takes tame, it's deep with the ideas, it's brutal, it's beyond anything i have seen in the last year and the half. And wait until the killer will be revealed, no twist or surprises here, just as in the real world, "True Detective" will show you a true, clueless evil. After Breaking Bad (B B) ended, I have waited for something to grip me the same way in anticipating the episode which follows the next week. This was it. Great in every way! Unlike B.B. the story follows a specific thread while entertaining us with various subplots (not a whole lot which is good as to not gum up the real story).<br/><br/>I suggest one see this using closed caption (subtitles) because the accents sometimes makes the conversations inaudible. It certainly helped me in this the third time I am viewing it.<br/><br/>I think the writing is as excellent as the acting. The direction and editing are very good as well. I would be surprised if this goes unnoticed when awards are drawn. *** Spoiler Starts ***<br/><br/>True Detective has a predictable scenario, that's true but it's more preferable and much watchable comparing to others. 'Cause acting is much better. Mystery is more charming. I've watched lots of thriller series but relatively this has not too much season. One story one season. And it's kinda an "extra feature-length" movie. In addition, action scenes are more realistic. There is no one hero – one battle scene.<br/><br/>Despite all of these positive sides there are some ill-judged parts. For instance, they spend too much time for their private lives. Michelle Monaghan's and the others' sex scenes have in scenario because of to increase viewer ratings and to make commercials. Classical American Tactic. If there is an evil-cult as enemy and serial murder, a "true detective" must only focus on the case. So, Detective Rust is a true detective but Detective Marty is not.<br/><br/>On last scene of last episode, as an astronomy conversation, Detective Rust says "Well, once, there was only dark. If you ask me, the light's winning." In fact it's wrong. If you search "Dark Matter" and "Dark Energy", Dark Energy will win actually and there will be no end for our universe. There will not be a "Big Crunch". I mean there will be only dark because of expanding acceleration of the universe. So I'm a "true viewer" in this situation.<br/><br/>phew<br/><br/>*** Spoiler Ends *** Set over 17 years, True Detective deals with an investigation into the ritualistic child murder of Dora Lange, both at the time in 1995 and through interviews with Rust Cohle (Mcconaughey) and Marty Hart (Harrelson)in 2012 reflecting on the case. The two intertwining time periods become progressively divergent and its structure could have been a mess but this is far from the case. Instead, it is a delicately crafted masterpiece of detective fiction.<br/><br/>What is striking at first is the setting, Louisiana's landscape is more than just that, it is an onlooker, a living and breathing observer that dares the detectives, goads them, mystifies them. The general cast is very strong but the performances of Mcconaughey and Harrelson are sublime. It is never rushed and always considered so the characters feel like they are developing almost in real-time as opinions of and sympathies with them are manipulated at ease. These are not Miami Vice, explosive hero cops, they are real people with very real weaknesses. <br/><br/>Okay, so it isn't rammed full of conventional crash-crash bang-bang action, it is instead absolutely saturated with psychological action. However, the needs of those who require pyrotechnics are catered for as well with what is one of the most tense, explosive and cinematic action scenes on television. If jaws aren't being picked up from off the floor after this then nothing will satisfy.<br/><br/>Where some criticism may be aimed at it for over-sexualising the female characters, this actually becomes a plot dynamic. And where Hart's wife, Maggie, may initially seem weak, she develops alongside her husband as their relationship is tested and strained which provides a tension of a very different and personal nature.<br/><br/>Though it could have been a mess, the structure and plot form a spiral, that seems abstract at first but works its way to a definite centre as it draws to its conclusion. It is philosophical without ever preaching, melancholic without being monotonous and gripping in a wealth of different ways. Simply stunning. it was awesome even when there seemingly was no action or development in story... characters, mood, and at the last episode, 8th, last 10 mins or so I got goose skin, I wasn't sure if it was truly something supernatural at work, with that best horror quote "come die with me here", or a nutcase case.<br/><br/>I can't give it less than 10/10. it was perfect story, characters, suspense wise. wow just wow. I hope producers got a good story figured for season 2, cause it will be hard to beat. I kind of got it all wrapped up, it will take some serious work to make it keep up in season 2 if they got one scheduled.<br/><br/>it was like watching A++ movie of 8 hours length This show exceeded my expectations by light years. Casting choices couldn't be more fitting and the chemistry between McConaughey and Harrelson is matchless. Both of their performances are immaculate, but Matthew's performance is really supreme. Matthew as a passionate Christian (in real life) really had me fooled here, and I'm probably not speaking only for myself.<br/><br/>This show's brilliancy fully comes out in it's mind-blowing awesome writing, which beautifully harmonizes with astonishing landscape. I particularly like this show, because it deals with ontological and other philosophical questions, which I believe is the point and soul of the show.<br/><br/>I read some review, criticizing the position and role of women in this show. Women here are not degraded and objectified, but are here merely to illuminate character's weaknesses and personality.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this show yet, I guarantee you, seeing it, will be one of your top 20 life choices. I would like to write a review just because i really enjoyed the series ..!! i just watched the 8 episodes and was disappointed that there not an other one to see... i wanted to know everything about the case from the beginning of the show ...but i guess than in every good story ..the best part of it that you ll never know all the secrets and some thing are ore likable as a mystery to the human mind! they said that the next season will be an other story(like the show American horror story) i hope that they ll keep the cast because it was phenomenal!!! i don't know if the next one will be that good because when you reach the top it is easy to fall cause of the expectations of the viewers that are really high.i just cross my fingers that there will be more!in my opinion everyone should give it a chance...watch it is a magnificent journey of good TV! First of all,a huge thank you and Congratulations to HBO for yet another great show.I expected a lot from this show,and fortunately,I was not disappointed.The episode starts with Det.Martin Hart and Det Rust Cole narrating about the case the former and the latter were assigned to,years back. Now, this is set against the backdrop of another high profile murder,the Lake Charles murder,which is currently going on. While Det Hart is a family man,loved by his colleagues,Det Cole is more of a secluded guy,somewhat of a jerk,who gets what he wants,who keeps to himself,whose past isn't known much,except for a daughter who passed away and a wife who left him.Det. Cole and Det. Hart are two sides of a coin.<br/><br/>As for the first episode,it just sets the stage for much more to come,all I can say is this point is,the show is a sure shot winner. Matthew McConaughey and Woddy Harrelson,deliver a stellar performance.They both understand their characters and do justice to them.To put it simply,they take the epicness to an whole other level.<br/><br/>The script is tightly woven and for a mystery/thriller show,it sure is quite unpredictable.Lots to things are yet to unravel,and I'm quite glad,that I wrote this review at this time,where there aren't much spoilers to be given out.For the fans of this genre,the show is a huge gourmet treat.If this awesomeness continues,this one would overshadow other shows at the awards next year!<br/><br/>In conclusion,this one is a brilliant show that is here to stay.If you've ever compiled a best TV shows list,then it needs a revision,ASAP. this HBO drama series is the worst and the most bore-you-to-death series. a very very poor screenplay trying so hard to give you a false impression to imply to you that this is the real deal cult-serial killing murder case investigation. but after patiently watched the beginning two episodes, a two hours going nowhere, snail-crawling, chain-smoking, binge beer drinking, kiss the white buttocks, two deadbeat crime investigators talking who-cares dialog, driving along the country roads shots after shots, questioning some big-deal thought-to-be-relevant victim's relatives, friends and whoever and so on, you still don't know why you would care more to watch this drive-you-nuts lousy series and hang onto it once every week, you just don't know what you should do to survive the 3rd episode. the worst arrangement of this series is mixed the dreary boring investigation with the seemingly internal affairs investigation to one of the partners of this murder case team members. it just gave you an impression that the drinking detective might did something weird or illegal or whatever who-gives-the-sh++t stuff during the investigation and the other family-guy-look-but-also-an-adulterer, the leading detective has to talk to the two black internal affairs guys in the police headquarter(station?), to expose his partner's weird behaviors.<br/><br/>so far, this drama series has already proved to be a 100% bomber, but most the reviewers still cluelessly gave high praises to this boring series. is it because there are two big names to play the main characters or, what? what has made you guys to love this two episodes? just because it's moody? dark? two guys speaking in a twirling southern accent? exotic? what? are you guys serious? it seems to me you guys are like junk food eaters, everything is just so delicious. well, what can i say, dudes? watching your weight. Enjoyed the first 2 episodes but by ep 3 I was getting a headache from the time-line jumping. Why do directors and editors feel this is neccessary to do it to such a degree that it leaves one confused and barely able to follw the story?<br/><br/>Hoping the time-line settles for the rest of the series or I'll give up on it, like I did midway through Season 2.<br/><br/>The acting from Mahershala Ali is superb nonetheless. The first and last seasons are a work of art.
Great cast, the stories are captivating, and the music is spot on. Season 1: Thrilling storyline, amazing cinematography and an outstanding central performance by Matthew McConaughey make the opening season binge worthy. Also, this season's opening theme is the best so far. Season rating 9/10.<br/><br/>Season 2: Poor storyline, disappointing performance by almost everyone turn the standard of the show pretty down. As compared to the season 1, the second season is a disaster. Season rating 6/10.<br/><br/>Season 3: This season is full of suspense. Mahershala Ali's performance alone is enough to describe the greatness of this season. Some eye-catching cinematography and plot twists are additional treat for the viewers. Season rating 8/10. The first season is definitely one of the fines crime series i've ever seen, and I watched a lot. Mostly because the writers, director(s), actors were on the same page, and Matthew Mcconaughey is one of the finest actor of our age. The last scene... was something, there are no words for it.<br/><br/>I can see the reason why they changed everything in the second season, the previous was too good to do anything similar. Sadly they failed. I could see the actors really tried, but sadly they just got stucked into strange, sometimes weird characters. All actors were good, but instead of keeping the good quality, the whole production failed. It didn't catch my attention, it was really boring. And this is NOT the actors failure!!<br/><br/>I think it was too much, they should have stopped after the first season. This is what usually happens with the best TV shows.<br/><br/>Anyway, we still have to first season, and i advice for those who haven't see the second: do not even watch it. And i hardly ever say anything like this. First of, thank you so much to everyone that took part in the making of season 1. It was cinematic perfection from my point of view, from the legendary long shot in episode 6 to the perfect acting of Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson. I would have a mile long list on the great things I've seen and learnt from season 1, but I'm here to stop you from watching season 2.<br/><br/>How I see things is that if a movie makes me forget it's a movie, it's a masterpiece. That is what season 1 did and that is what season 2 managed to ruin. That is why I believe season 1 deserves 10 out of 10 and season 2 is a barely 4 out of 10 - and that's just out sheer respect for the first one.<br/><br/>I don't think it is just one thing that made me dislike season 2. From the casting to the dialogue comprised of what seemed like either Facebook statuses or fortune cookie lines, nothing felt real. Acting was mostly comprised of long stares and the only thing that made me feel part of that story were the long and awkward dialogue pauses that allowed me to scream at the screen for something to happen. I waited for 8 full episodes for Matthew McConaughey to pop out of some dark corner and tell us that this is just a joke - I really kept hoping till the last moment that this wasn't happening. It was like everyone was doing this for the first time, acting especially.<br/><br/>I never hate on films and appreciate the work everyone did and I understand that they've set really high standards with the first season, but if you know that you can't rise to the occasion, then don't ruin something great.<br/><br/>I urge you not to watch season 2 if you don't want to get your heart broken into tiny pieces. I would personally watch the "50 Shades of Grey" abomination 8 times instead of this. The only thing worth something is the soundtrack, and it's one of the few things that stopped me from rating it a flat 1.<br/><br/>That is all. The crow who wanted to be the swan. Frankly, I am disappointed. Season 1 was such an absolute delight. It deserved the dark and mysterious theme music and grey tones. This season was just another story. You can fit any of the characters from any other law and order drama in it, and they would have played it better. Vince Vaugh can NOT act. high profile parties with hookers and drugs? And the security is so shitty that they go in and come out without a scratch? No cameras? And what was the point of the Woodrugh character? Absolute crap. I am giving it 3 stars only because 2 out the 3 of the main characters died at the end. That's the only saving grace. Such a disappointment. First: My star rating is that of season 1; It is impossible to watch True Detective without comparing season 2 with season 1 and given that the story lines, actors; and characters are completely different that is a bit unfair. However--and I freely admit I've only watched a few of the episodes from season 2, the reviews don't encourage me to watch more.... The biggest difference so far, and where they've failed, is that season 1 grabbed your attention from the very first episode. It introduced the serial killer(s) in a very creepy, visceral and shocking storyline that is completely missing from season 2. Season 2 can be a completely different story, but fans were hooked by the intensely disturbing mythos surrounding the murders in season 1 (and the process of unraveling that mythos along with the very relevant and equally disturbing histories of the perpetrators). Surely the writers could have come up with an entirely different scenario that was equally mysterious, creepy and with cult-like overtones. It was a mistake to ignore why season 1 was such a hit; it wasn't the choice of headliners (though they helped), it was the imaginative and haunting histories of the families involved, as well as the plausible, quasi-religious cultist overtones. It was a fascinating and horrifying story with a believable resolution. That's what hooked the audience, and that is what is missing from season 2. This season is much more like a standard police detective story, and that is what is really disappointing viewers. I'm a big fan of Crime/Mystery Dramas. Whether they are casual like Detective Monk or The Mentalist or dark like Seven I give them all a try. <br/><br/>A friend of mine recommended True Detective, but at first I didn't expect that much. The name just didn't impress me. By that I mean I could not see what would make this series special. Every great Crime Series' main character has a special trait. Monk is an eccentric with many phobias, Dexter and Patrick Jane are sociopaths and Poirott likes to polish his shoes :) . So from a title like that, I simply thought that True Detective would be similar to CSI or NCIS. But boy I was wrong! Not only is Rust the protagonist to whom I can relate the most (I share some of his views), but also a surprisingly realistic depiction of a human, who has lost his purpose in life. I loved his nihilistic views on the world and his intelligent monologues during the story. He made me think about my life, where our society is heading and what our purpose as humans is. Then we have Marty, "an ordinary dude with a big ..." who is the embodiment of the average middle- aged hot-headed man. He has the brains but he simply hasn't put enough thought in the social matters, which Rust brings up (Role of Religion in the society etc.). He is an ordinary person who just had bad luck when it comes to getting teamed up with a partner. The antithesis between Rust and Marty's mentalities becomes apparent really often in the show and create really good opportunities for creative dialog, which is probably one of its biggest advantages. <br/><br/>Moving on to the plot of the show, I wouldn't call it too complex but neither would I characterise it as simple. There is a serial killer on the loose, who sacrifices people as offerings to a deity. As Marty and Rust get closer to discovering him a bigger scheme gets unveiled, which involved politicians, priests and other big names. However, the way in which the plot is laid out is truly marvellous. You never get bored while watching the show and you can't lose your concentration. At times the development slows down, but then you are presented with Rust's speeches, which give you food for thought until the pace picks up again. Overall, the plot is built really well and as an ordinary TV series viewer I can't see any plot holes or drawbacks in the way it is presented.<br/><br/>When it comes to acting, there is not much to say. It is as you would expect. Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey are pretty much the best people I could think of for such roles and they do deliver. The side characters are of less interest to me in this series, since they don't have much screen time, however I can also spot some good actors among them. I really liked the preacher of Tent Revival, Marty's Wife and the two detectives interviewing Rust and Marty. <br/><br/>To conclude, this is the only show I have given a 10/10 to. I have already watched it twice and I don't even think that will suffice. I have to point out that this may not be a show for everyone. It is quite dark and pessimistic, but in my case this exact trait made me love it. I haven't watched any of Season 2 yet, I will wait until it's over to watch it all at once. But I really hope they continue along this path. You don't see many shows like this nowadays. True Detective shows what American TV can be when not constrained by soap commercials and watershed viewing. This was an adult series with a big difference from all others. It isn't a soap opera as are so many others. There's a plot and it is resolved after episode eight There's may be other TD series but with a different plot and Matthew has already said he won't reprise this role.<br/><br/>He and Woody are superb as two cops from different world and philosophies. But they work together at a team to eventually solve a cold case that's been bugging them for more than 10 years.<br/><br/>The gloomy atmosphere is beautifully conveyed by T Bone's opening theme song...fantastic.<br/><br/>The only negative aspect was the seemingly endless metaphysical ramblings of Matthew. But it did add to his personality. Written brilliantly by Nic Pizzolato with intriguing story elements and in-depth characters, HBO's terrific Crime-Drama series is brought beautifully onto the screen through the efficient hands of Director Cary Fukunaga. Truly dark and compelling story, with captivating visual style.<br/><br/>Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson are remarkable and effective as Homicide Detectives, Rust Cohle and Martin Hart, who become entangled in a 17-year hunt for a serial killer in Louisiana. Woody as the angry but down-to-earth rule-following officer, and Matthew as the calm, depressed, intelligent but eccentric partner, both in conflict with each others' ideals, but humane and passionate in quest for justice. The angst, pain and depth portrayed by these talented actors is a real treat for a Crime series.<br/><br/>Adam Arkapaw's camera-work and T-Bone Burnett's music score create the perfect mood for the dark and compelling series it is; from the opening credits song and the initial crime scene itself you could easily guess the kind of crime series it's going to be.<br/><br/>The revelations and twists are placed carefully and masterfully, never losing the grip from the plot. The finale was haunting and spectacular at he same time; truly a deserving end.<br/><br/>With such brilliant performances in the first season, I really pity the actors who'll be chosen follow this act, in the second season (since it's an anthology series). Great first five episodes, 4 + 5 being amazing in particular. 6-7 being thoroughly mediocre but the finale bringing back some of the magic I hadn't felt in weeks. Overall, I wish I could give it an A- but 2/8 episodes being totally weak makes me give it a B+. But I do hope people wait a little bit before claiming a show's future reputation when only a few episodes have aired. All the hype and the fanbase passion not totally deserved, definitely not for people to be claiming it's going to be "considered alongside The Sopranos/The Wire/Breaking Bad" when the first season hasn't even ended AND it's an anthology show. So basically, I have more complaints about some of the extremely vocal fanbase, which is reminiscent of Breaking Bad's and how awful some can be. Over here in Europe Sky Atlantic is just beginning the series - so we're behind the curve.<br/><br/>There are many erudite reviews here already, so I won't attempt any of that.<br/><br/>The thought that Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey would be playing against each other sounded good - and episode 1 proved that right in spades.<br/><br/>The dialog is extremely well written. Think no one has conversations like those in the car?. Found myself agreeing with most of Detective Rust Cohle's bleak views of the human race - and I'm not at all depressed. The scene at the second attempt at dinner; excellent.<br/><br/>As the story became clearer there are hints of other series, but with the two leads in place I feel it's going to have it's own uniqueness. After all there is the likes of Carnivale to live up to.<br/><br/>Anywhere close to that and we all have another Collector's Series. As the title says above, I'm hooked. NOTE: I'm not an expert critic, so I shall not give some feeble attempt at it, which always comes across as being a blowhard-ish community college English teacher who missed their calling!<br/><br/>That said, this season of "True Detective" has me confused as to why I am so entranced. I think it's the best little pieces of seasons 1 & 2, plus a TON of other things you'll see below:<br/><br/>In Season 1, it was easily the smoking, speech & incredibly tense dynamic between Texas hewvyweight stars MM & WH's characters. I still show people the scenes of "Rust" chain-smoking, plus the way he talks & acts JUST LIKE a lot of the people I grew up with in western NC. It's uncanny although I realize he didn't have to venture far to achieve this character! Texas has these "folks", too.<br/><br/>And when I say I liked season 1, the highlights from above
are what really pulled me in-made it impossible to look away, even though he had made a total physical & emotional wreck of himself in the present day "interview scenes".<br/><br/>But no matter how the partners (Rust & Marty) are towards each other, coworkers, their families & subjects of their investigations, we still pull for them due to the repulsiveness of the crimes & criminals they tirelessly & ruthlessly (& recklessly) chase.<br/><br/>One other amateur observation: The race aspect of this season is incredibly real, ever-present & constantly has potential for boil-overs & explosive interactions (literally & figuratively!!), making any empathetic viewer feel for minorities...feeling what it's like to walk a mile (or 100) in the other's shoes (unless they kick them off to run from a herd of rabid rednecks!! Hehehehe).<br/><br/>No matter who they are or what titles they hold, it's obvious that the "Good-Ole-Boy Network is still very prevalent in all three eras explored in this season, although the later in time we go, the more they seem to lessen, even though I'm sure many don't see this the same was as I. You can literally feel the awkwardness & experience the frustrations, fear & settling as this isn't the first & wont be the last times they experience ANY of this, no matter how passive or aggressive the racism is.<br/><br/>Season 2 - I got pulled in by other things...and I promise, I still liked it. I think they were 1-2 actor misfires of being a decent season. I love Vince Vaughn, but he doesn't play a very convincing gangster. Most of that series felt forced to me.... personally. Too much suspension of too much disbelief!<br/><br/>Season 3 - as EVERYONE has stated, they've (showrunners) gone back to their successful roots. The cigarette smoking is still a predominantly featured (as it has been in all seasons), but what sets it apart is the flashbacks to 2 different eras plus Hayes' current age & rapidly (seeming) declining mental state allows for unique inner monologues to fill gaps in time / information without being overly obvious, time-consuming or boring....plus it's fun to watch them pull of sets, wardrobe, vehicle/equipment & styling transitions seamlessly! The quick "time-travel" transitions also helps keep viewers following the correct timeframe without being too confusing or frustrating to the viewers & not all but shouting "hey, y'all, we are in 1980. Now we are in 1990!!" Lol.<br/><br/>I know this sounds silly & just my interpretation, but with the many constant distractions people deal with these days, it's good to have some help while keeping hardcore film buffs at bay. Just as with food, they can be almost impossible to satisfy (but I love all you folks reading this, no matter how damn picky you are!!)<br/><br/>Give season 3 a try if you are on the fence. Don't stop until you watch at LEAST 3 episodes so the character & story development gets out of the way). It's worth it & although similar to season 1 (where / region of USA, children as prey, possible church involvement, casting perfection & multiple evolving partner dynamics). some feeble attempt at it, which always comes across as being a blowhard-ish community college English teacher who missed their calling!<br/><br/>That said, this season of "True Detective" has me confused as to why I am so entranced.<br/><br/>Season 1, it was easily the smoking, speech & incredibly tense dynamic between Texas hewvyweight stars MM & WH's characters.

It's worth it & although similar to season 1 (where / region of USA, children as prey, possible church involvement, casting perfection & multiple evolving partner dynamics). Basically the first season is just amazing , it has something in store for mystery and drama lovers alike. Even if the first season kinda starts off slow, the perfomances just make it amazing.And McConaughey has given a brilliant performance and really keep us glued to the show.
But sadly with season 3 Mahershala Ali happened and he just made the show about his stupid mumblings and utterly boring performance. Literally when hes on screen the playback speed goes .25x . Anyways the first season is amazing and is truly worth the watch. Series 1. 9/10, outstanding performance from Matthew McConaughy, best of all three.
Series 2. 7/10, my least favourite of the three, worth watching for Vince Vaughn.
Series 3. 9.5/10, casting, directing and the storyline exceptionally good. Stephen Dorff WOW. Well season 1 was good 10/10.I usually remember only the good movies and i have no idea why i gave 4/10 rating but i tried watching those season 2 and 3 again.I couldn't.<br/><br/>Note to self: If you gave bad rating don't try to watch it again. Season 1: 8 (1 viewing)
Season 2: 7 (1 viewing)
Season 3: 5
eh. not as intriguing, the story didn't grip me. really slow. (1 viewing) Nothing really happens over 8 episodes. People are being really bitter and sad over what could have been or not. No closure. Nothing. Just a couple of old detectives being bitter because they never understood or solved the case. Season three in short:
Fine story build up, Disappointing end I've watched all three seasons of True Detective. The first one was indeed a masterpiece, season two was good; still better than a lot of other more average shows; and season three was more similar to season one in many ways than season two; if I'm honest the ending could be seen as an anticlimax, but then again, not really; it's actually realistic in that often in real life, the line between good and bad or right and wrong is not clearly delineated, as seen by the two detectives' reaction to Mr Julius's 'confession'. What I really appreciated, and thought was a great device, was the intersplicing of past, present and future often in ostensibly the same shot as an almost continuous scene that alternated between the same situation but at different times, with the two detectives. Also, when Wayne is being observed by his younger self as an older man or vice versa; this is extremely innovative and adds greatly to the plot and connects all the diverse strands. I suppose when you think about it, there really is no such thing as future or past, and we really do live in the eternal present. Nor do I think the past is a fixed thing, if that was the case, then there could be no future; as the future is simply the past that hasn't happened yet, from our perspective. But of course from other perspectives, or namely one other perspective, that being the divine, then past, present and future are indistinguishable. This series does throw up a lot of philosophical questions; I honestly think the end of season one was very dramatic, but also quite disturbing; the end of season two was perhaps disappointing; but the ending of this latest season is the most satisfying, if perhaps a bit frustrating while being true to life, in that there were no real 'baddies', and clear 'justice' as such, just a lot of damaged and fallible people who did the best they could given the circumstances. My rating is only based on first season which is perfect. The characters, the acting, the style of directing, everything is perfect. Maybe best chemistry between 2 actors ever seen on screen. Second season is really bad, like unwatchable. I would rate it 2/10 because I fell asleep every single episode. The third season iis simmilar to first and starts really good but then it gets boring because they half of episodes are focused on relationship between Purple Hayes and his wife. Mahershala Ali is amazing and his fellow Roland is also great. Last season is like 8/10 and I highly recommend you to skip second season and watch first and third because they aren't related. Season 3.<br/><br/>The only objective fact about season three is that it it tries to imitate season one as much as possible. And it's a good thing, isn't it? Again we are introduced to the pair of detectives who has to resolve a mysterious murder through long passage of time. Again this pair consist of a man with no place in life and simple middlebrow. Again we have to watch how the murder affects the lives of protagonists and listen to the tons of philosophical elevated dialogs. And yet again this a journey downhill, to desolation, up until the very last minutes. Nic Pizzolatto prepared something fresh, of course, but the positives of season three are not those fresh changes but the mere fact the Nic Pizzolatto is still a great writer. His perception of life and his representation human everyday problems and feelings is superb and worth watching. In particular, Wayne Hays' blend of earnest idealism and social awkwardness is fascinating and realistic as his love and hate relationship with unscrupulous and yet tactful Amelia Reardon, both masterfully played by Mahershala Ali and Carmen Ejogo respectively. Roland West by Stephen Dorff is more disappointing, unfortunately. In the first episode he seems to be a complete dullard, later, thankfully, he blooms into something more complicated (his relationship with Tom Purcell is example of sophistication). Still, he serves the role of cliche down-to-earth supportive cop. There are some more intriguing moments about new season, like some turns in the investigation, bewildering ending or the overall morale message of the story but they do not manage to eclipse the respective devices of the Rust and Marty adventure.<br/><br/>Anyway, it's either I am dull and narrow-minded (which is most likely) or Nic Pizzolatto became too full of himself. There are a few simple but huge mistakes of season three that removes it from "the greatest" competition. One is unnecessary multiple timelines. I don't see how exactly do they bring benefit compared to linear narration. What they do for certain is spoil the whole investigation. Second is completely irrelevant Wayne hallucination scenes. Talking dead wife? Vietnamese appearing behind the back? I was embarrassed by looking at it. The third, and my primary complain, is that season three is pretentious, thru and thru. It is seen in every aspect of the series, from how the town reacts to the disappearance of children to how Wayne behaves at home. Nic Pizzolatto stresses too much on tragedy, he creates this mood of stagnation, desperation, inescapable past that permits every minute of season. I understand that the murder of children is terrible but the simple truth is that people easily forget. And I do not try to defend callousness, I want to say that *every minute* of sulking is too much and unrealistic. The other aspect of that problem is dialogs. Just pick any dialog between main characters and study it for a bit: look and the faces, analyze the choice of words. Do you think ordinary people talk in such way? You see, Rust was eccentric philosopher from the very first minute but all heroes of season three advertised as *normal* people. Nic Pizzolatto writing definitely suffers from overcomplication (but it still superb as I wrote in first paragraph). And the fourth, and final, is detective. Ehmm, where is it, if you don't mind me asking? "Do you feel like any kinda closure" ask Roland in the last episodes and then we watch half an hour the roving of Wayne through past, present and future, ominous music playing at background. You think, "Will something else happen?" but nothing happens except for a sudden realization that True Detective is all about drama, while detective serves as supporting device. Don't you think it should be the other way around? I mean, the series are called "True Detective".<br/><br/>And this is my final verdict: drama is astounding, watch it; detective is just a title.<br/><br/>6/10 Season 3 was certainly stellar compared to Season 2; however, the final episode of S3 was anti-climatic and therefore earned a rating of 8 from me rather than a solid 10. True Detective. Is it any good? That is the question.<br/><br/>TV shows are a gamble, they require you to commit a substantial amount of time, and often, they give nothing of substance in return for that irreplaceable time.<br/><br/>True Detective isn't your typical show, its a seasonal anthology, each instalment built with a fresh cast, fresh location, and fresh mystery. Running though the show, is an aesthetic palette. Dark and foreboding, complimented by saturated whites and bleak open landscapes. The show values actors and rewards patience.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, even with such a concrete philosophical foundation, the show is made by humans, and so frequently disappoints.<br/><br/>The show is much talked about, principally, on the back of its debut season, which may well be one of the best in TV history. Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey are perfectly cast, the mystery perfectly opaque, and the setting perfectly wild. Disparate elements of filmmaking come together to form an aether of fear and wonder. A modern noir masterpiece.<br/><br/>After season 1 however, the show fails to surpass expectations. Season 2 is completely forgettable. Don't bother.<br/><br/>Worst of all? Season 3 is an overcompensation from the producers to rescue the show. Hours are wasted on character actor Mahershalla Ali, to the point where one feels it should be called "The Mahershalla Ali TV Detective Show", with Stephen Dorff underused, or miscast, it is hard to tell which. Poor dialogue, and the equally poor use of flashbacks and/or flashforwards are muddled with a lack of focus on the actual detective work. Ali's bland character seems to be the focus ultimately, leaving us wondering, is this show any good? Or is it just bad? In the past twenty years, HBO has turned out some of the most impressive shows: The Sopranos, Six Feet Under, Game of Thrones, etc. Another is Nic Pizzolatto's "True Detective". Each season has a different plot, always focusing on detectives investigating a case and having to sort through all manner of sleazy elements. This is not like any cop show that you've ever seen. Definitely see it. Season 1: 10/10
Season 2: 8.5/10<br/><br/>Hoping season 3 is more like season 1 Season 1 is perfect and I think we all agree on that but why doesn't people admire season 2 that much?
Yes it's confusing but starting from driving Caspere's body, continuing with how Frank deals with business, finished how they gave up their lives season 2 was amazing. I'm not trying to convince anyone, but here's why I love second season so much:
Just think about Franks dialogue with his wife in "Night Finds You", this show with its clues really makes you think about it's all paper-machine. And what if - if it actually was? What it this all was just in Franks head, while he's in that basement, getting eaten by rats?
Moving to "Maybe Tomorrow", when Rey hears about his death way too early, "You're small, trees are like giants... Oh son, they kill you; They shoot you to pieces." exactly as it happened after.
And characters? they are great:
Take Paul, for example, he was "just trying to be a good man", which he actually was. He was very good in that shoot-out, and he got that men taken care of as well, it's heartbreaking how Woodrugh fought his way out, only to be shot in the back. He died to save people he didn't know that well, he died to save Raymond who wasn't saved anyway;
Raymond who did this all for his kid, dying for his kid;
and last one: Frank - a "gangster" who got himself killed for a suit. But it wasn't just about suit, it was about dignity.
Soundtracks, dialogues, acting, etc - This show is simply a thing of beauty. I fully agree with your comment. Second season was disaster It was an amazing story. Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson did a phenomenal job in this series. It was everything you could ask for in a mystery thriller. True Detective was directed by Nic Pizzolatto who based the entire story line on the concept of anthology. The concept of anthology series was especially popular during the Golden Age of Television in the 1950's and represents different story and a different set of characters in each season or episode for that matter. The series contained 2 seasons of 8 episodes each.<br/><br/>The series was about, two homicide detectives, Marty Hart (Woody Harrelson) and Rusty Cohle (Matthew McConaugghey) who investigate mysterious cases of women and children then discover personal secrets of those involved. The unique and highlighting point of the series is the clash and action between two personalities; Marty Hart being a usual detective with the lack of time to spend with family and Rusty Cohle being the brains behind the investigation and work. However, Rusty had no families to be around and was pretty much dedicated to work, and his special way of "Seeing Things" literally made the viewer see things from a different perspective when it came to the two fantastic leads.<br/><br/>Rusty considered himself a realist but in philosophical terms he is a pessimist and Marty was the optimist. They could work with each other but that stayed only at work as Rusty's meta-philosophical way of seeing the world was the core element of the clash between the two personalities.<br/><br/>The conflict between the two personalities, could be seen as the cartoonic Tom & Jerry where none of them and both of them wanted each other.<br/><br/>What actually turned this detective work into an interesting series, was that it was unclear where the show was going and where it will take you. The trick of leaving a door open for the next episode and real time hallucinations though reflecting on "Curiosity kills the cat" made the show more attractive.<br/><br/>The show contained of 2 seasons, reflecting over the anthology series, having different story and different set of characters. The second season starred Colin Farrell, Vince Vaughn, Rachel McAdams and Taylor Kitsch as the main roles and followed a police work in the urban areas. The turn in the second season was, statistically, not appreciated by many viewers. The turn was especially in the destructive police work and less living up to its title. Taking into consideration the play being more or less muddled and confusing which brought down the attractiveness. However, there has been a plan to produce the third season with unmentioned actors. I've watched series 1 and 2.<br/><br/>They are both brilliant. To anyone who has not seen both series, it's worth noting that they are completely independent of each other. You can watch series 2 first, or series 1 first. There is no connection between each series. They are different stories, different characters. It's only the style of the show that is similar.<br/><br/>I have a question, I'm hoping someone can answer. Are these stories complete fiction, or are they based on true stories?<br/><br/>Thanks in anticipation. If you put 9 out of ten for the first season then i can assume you will put 4 for the next season. It was so horrible. So many branches of stories and you will get lost. And more importantly you don't care about those character and their stories. So pathetic and silly their stories.Unlike we have seen a great acting and thrilling chemistry in season 1. The second one, they just show off. But who cares!<br/><br/>Will you go for True detective ? I will definitely recommend you to watch season one. Besides the second one, they just murder this true potential of this series. Even the girls in season one is so aristocratic as well as sexy than the second one. Best TV show I have ever seen goes very deep into human nature and hits the nail right on the head. This is the best acting you will probably ever see from the actors/actresses that are in the true detective series I think with all the experience of the actors and directors involved they certainly know what they are doing. I don't think they could off pulled off the emotions any better than they have breaking bad game of thrones etc are excellent TV shows but are lacking the depth and reality that is given across by the characters the first series of true detective was brilliant but this one is even better. I really hope they bring another series out I cannot believe this show gets a 9.3 rating! If it were judged on the first 3 episodes, I would take no issue. However, after said first 3, the quality of the plots declines rapidly. I'd give the last episode maybe a 2. I have no issue with the acting. The leads (Matthew McConaughey, Woody Harrelson) are excellent as is just about every other player. But, the storyline goes down the tube. Much time is taken establishing certain lines of inquiry but they are never resolved. That alone might not be so bad but there is eventually no real connection to the actual denouement. It just sort of happens. Let's hope season 2 will be consistent in quality and at the level of the first few episodes of season 1. Maybe the writers should take a course in logic? I actually really enjoyed this. Generally I'm not really into series such as this, as I tend not to have time to watch them when they are aired, but this was given to me on DVD. Having watched it, I think that this genre, where a storyline can be explored and played out over 6 hours or so has great appeal (if on DVD!!) as there is time to develop a plot without making things so obvious for the viewer as is the problem if trying to squeeze into a 2.5 hour film. <br/><br/>The first episode was good, but the next two or three were a little slow, and then the last 4 were very good, if a tad predictable. Good camera work, arty enough without going OTT, a plot that wasn't unbelievable, good casting. The usual nude scene or two, which I never really think adds anything to the plot.<br/><br/>But the biggest complaint is not being able to hear and understand what was being said. Fortunately I had this on DVD and I had to use subtitles, which is absolutely ridiculous (but at least I could catch what was going on). (Review for Season 1)<br/><br/>True Detective is a masterpiece that will prove why the 2010's is probably the best decade Television has had to offer. (Excuse Reality TV). Audiences have always been desperate for not quite something that's new, but something that is unusual and weird. Something that isn't the ordinary.<br/><br/>You see, True Detective could have been like any other detective/cop story. The show contains several clichÃ©s that are often associated with detective stories but Writer Nic Pizzolatto makes it more refreshing. The story follows a case about the murder of Dora Lange in 1995 in Louisiana. She appeared to be a victim of some sort of ritual by a cult. Two Detectives, Rustin Cohle (Matthew McConaughey) and Martin Hart (Woody Harrelson) are interviewed in 2012 about the case after they apparently caught the killer years earlier. The entire season goes goes back and fourth with the timelines of 1995/2002 and 2012. About the characters, Martin is an Average Joe type character. Just a fairly normal person that has a wife and kids. Rust however is one of the most unique characters portrayed on TV. A loner and a nihilist. Much of his dialogue in his interviews contains philosophical monologues based on his existential nihilism. It's stuff you won't usually hear in movies let alone TV! It's really added flavor to True Detective with the occult themes which is why I love it. The acting is also phenomenal. Matthew McConaughey really owns the character of Rust. <br/><br/>True Detective is destined to be a classic. ** SPOILER ALERT ** <br/><br/>"True Detective" - in all of its glory for all the 8 episodes of season 1 - is fantastic! From the casting to the cinematography to the soundtracks employed, this TV serial rocks in every way. More significantly, the characterization of the two lead detectives is beautiful.<br/><br/>Another amazing aspects of film-making for this series is the progression of two narrative threads running concurrently in parallel. While the flashbacks of the past throw light into the various aspects of the detectives' personal lives, the present interviews of the two detectives provide readers with the insights of how the two detectives view each other.<br/><br/>Despite the slow pacing, it is easy for viewers to be drawn in by the plot and characterization right from the very start.<br/><br/>A very well-directed TV series! I strongly recommend it! A number of critics have recently suggested that True Detective has a "perfect ending". In Terri Schwartz review, she writes that it's "a gorgeous, stylized and dark exploration into the worst parts of the human psyche." There's no better description than that. Basically, she is saying that the show goes beyond the surface of what most crime dramas do and pulls you in to a deeper, darker side. Others agree while emphasizing how incredible and riveting the show is. Both Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson's performances are superb.<br/><br/>In my opinion, critics are are surely right about the perfect ending. and although the story can be rather confusing throughout the show, it's certainly suspenseful and captivating. I found myself constantly wanting to know what was going to happen next. Anyone familiar with great crime dramas would agree that True Detective is among the top five. This show has something going on for it that if it's for you, it'd take you to some different level of analyzing yourself and life altogether and if it ain't, then it's your bad luck I'd say.It just grips you from your soul; questions you on every single thing you believe in; plays with your emotions, thoughts; breaks you apart; gather the pieces back up and turns you into a different person.Still confused, aloof, lost, but a bit better I suppose. Everything linked with the show is a genius.The cast, even the tiniest of characters, the lingering music, the locations, the setting, the writing, the story, the direction, everything about it was just flawless.It didn't matter to me whether they were ever gonna solve the murders at all, but just the way the whole thing was building up, watching it all was plain bliss. Only watch this show if you have the taste for something dark, slow paced, deep, layered, intense, but satisfying and fulfilling.I haven't seen anything like this ever though in any genre.This is something that's gonna stay with you for a long long time. And hats off to Woody Harrelson "Martin Hart" and Matthew McConaughey "Rust Cohle" for giving us the pleasure of watching something like this.. If you think it's for you, go for it..It hits the right spot!! HBO turn out some of the best television there is to offer, and this show is no exception. I've just finished the first (and so far only) season and all I feel is awe: From the sheer depth of the two main characters to the set pieces, the cinematography, use of symbolism... just the story as a whole. It is almost perfect. As I write this, I am struggling to think of any other character in any other show that has been portrayed with such raw tenacity and believability than that of Matthew McConaughey's Rust Cohle. <br/><br/>I've seen many up-voted negative reviews here on IMDb and all I can fathom is that the authors and subsequent up-voters were either judging the show by one, possibly two episodes, or just didn't have the capacity to follow such an intricate narrative. Society today seems to be defined by instant gratification, people want what they want, and they want it fast. There is little respect for pace, taking ones time, really being able to appreciate something for what it is. <br/><br/>This show caters to an audience that can follow complexity, that can appreciate a story without the use of Michael Bay-esque explosions every 4 minutes, pretty teenage actors, canned one-liners and fast action. As it progresses, it becomes as dark as the night and is completely unapologetic for doing so. <br/><br/>If you're a fan of The Sopranos, The Wire, Deadwood, Boardwalk Empire et al - shows that take their time and develop their characters properly, you will almost certainly love this. If somehow you haven't seen any of these, are reading this review but haven't yet started watching True Detective, make sure to leave your phone alone for just one hour. Leave your laptop or computer alone, just watch the show and I'm almost certain that you'll feel compelled to watch another episode as soon as possible. <br/><br/>I highly doubt that the next season will come even remotely close to the brilliance of the first, but here's to hoping. <br/><br/>Cheers After seeing True Detective back when it was released, and mulling over it a bit, I feel somewhat frustrated. There are elements of this show that I absolutely love, and elements that are incredibly frustrating.<br/><br/>One of the things I appreciate most about movies and TV-shows is when they manage to create an atmosphere that grows thick and really reaches out to you, through the screen. True Detective definitely manages this. From the brilliant southern landscapes, to the music and moods, all the way to the actors. It all comes together beautifully. And for more than half the season, the plot and character development manages to keep up.<br/><br/>Then something happens. When it gets really thick, your questions are answered and the conclusion draws near, it's as if the script-writers suddenly stopped and said "Ok, what now? Where do we go from here?". Where indeed... I will of course not write anything about the conclusion of the show, except to say that it didn't live up to the magnificent beginnings. Still, this show was one of my absolute favorites so far this year. Harrelson was great, McConaughey was glorious and the rest of the cast met expectations. It's just as dirty, sweaty and degenerate as you would hope.<br/><br/>This show, although slightly flawed in the department where HBO usually shines (script and plot), I would say that this show really reinforces HBO:s standing as the premier producer of first-rate TV-shows. The first three episodes unfold, exposing a suspenseful melodrama spawned from the brilliant mind of Nic Pizzolatto. In the beginning, "True Detective," appears to transcend all expectations, promptly redefining the traditional potboilers as no more than puerile challenges for the doltish and ignorant. I was hooked. At first, it seemed Nic's horrifying tapestry was leading the viewer into some unspeakable psychological purgatory â€“ a dark place â€“ a soulless place. This macabre and hypnotic dance was clearly not designed for everybody. The net of this cerebral tingler is intended for a more analytical catch, inviting the less interested and feeble-minded to leave. Everything was moving along great â€“ and then episode four happened. The show made the triple-jump from unique to mundane and then to lost on some wandering path. Not exactly what I wanted. I will probably continue to watch 'Detectives' as long as this show does not become an exercise in tedium. I feel it is time to define the two main characters. The weekly psycho-struggle is no longer interestingÂ…but irritatingÂ…wrap the story up. It is obvious that the writer is very skilledÂ…use his talents to develop new story lines. Without a doubt, this is a well acted program. Even though I am normally not a big fan of Woody Harrelson he is a very skilled actor and does a fantastic job in this show. Matthew McConaughey â€“ I am a big fan â€“ he is great in anything he does, except for chick-flicks â€“ yuck. It will be interesting to see what happens next season. The first three episodes were spectacular and on their weight alone I will give this show an '8.' I hope they get back on track next season. The production quality is great, and the milieu of characters is held together by the pairing of Harrelson and McConaughey as state police officers. The setting is Louisiana; more specifically, along the coast. The bayou is green, lush and cinematically appealing. The skies are usually overcast without raining down, thereby avoiding the clichÃ© of adding rain for melodrama that some noir-istic series may be guilty of including in their episodes. Grisly graphics are more shocking because of their weirdness instead of gore. <br/><br/>The narrative is a tri-timeline: 1995, 2002 and the present. Season One catches is up to the facts and mindset of the characters. I'm looking forward to watching (and reviewing) Season Two. Truly dark. Well beyond nihilism. I don't like "crime dramas", but the intersection of the characters internal lives and the occult is fascinating and terrifying. Fantastic "payoff."<br/><br/>Didn't watch the other season on recommendations from friends and such terrible reviews. A none patient person would find this Series boring. It's true that the events are slow but hey! It's all for the great of good, in matter of fact it wasn't slow bcz If there's somethings that matter the most in this series, it would be details. How each episode is constructed is a vital point of understanding how beautiful This series is (only first season). Nonetheless patience is still required, but the performance of the characters would be a great compensation for the slow events. Especially when ma man matter mcconaughey is in the lead. So slow or fast, you're gonna enjoy this anyway and it's only 8 episodes, you will not regret it for sure. Season 1: 10/10
Season 2: 6/10
Season 3: 8/10
Overall: 8/10 This is a show that deserves to waste time for because no weekneses in it and the script was wonderfull In true detective season 2 we watching Ray velcoro an alchoholic detective, Frank a friendly gangster boss, Anne a brave and dynamic detective and Paul a Police officer who wants to serve justice. Season 2 is The worst Of the series. Unfortunately season's 2 plot was make me tired many times during The season and unlike season 1 the characters had not have chemistry between them. But that is not make season 2 bad. It has plenty Of action, well playing acting, Good Soundtrack.
True detective season 2 rating: 7,5 True detective is and HBO classic. In season 1 we watching Matthew Mcconaguey as Rusty cole and woody harelson as Martin Hart trying to solve a homocite stranger that an usuall one. This drama-crime season is The Best season Of the series with well playing acting, magnificent Soundtrack and a plot that everybody gonna enjoy. Rating Of the season 1: 8,7/10 Still season 1 the one which deserve to be watched , season 3 not bad as well , season 2 ðŸ˜© Still i complete Season - 1 , its is super .
Its not a family show , see it just keep this thing in mind. Would agree that Season 1 was much more well developed, plot driven and acted, as compared to Season 2. As for those of you who have been told that Season 2 is not worth watching, don't pay any attention to that nonsense. It is true that it did not live up to the grand expectations from Season 1, but given the various plot lines, the unique and twisted subplots, and more fine acting from Hollywood's Elite in Season 2, from #VinceVaughn, #ColinFarrell, and the ever stunning, #RachelMcAdams, while just scratching the surface with the quality cast starring in Season 2.<br/><br/>Considering the transition so many Big Screen Movie Actors have made to the proverbial Small Screen, how frenetic must one be, to avoid watching an award winning show's sophomore season, solely because you may find Season 2 to be somewhat of a let down after watching the intensity of Season 1. However, that being said, having just finished Season 3, Episode 3, I believe that the True Detective series is more mind-bending than we have been exposed to in previous seasons. It is hard to argue that Season 3 will be as popular or successful as Season 1, especially given the initial "reveal" of the series, which comprised many phenomenal actors, two of which are considered some of Hollywood's Finest, in #MatthewMcConaughey and #WoodyHarrelson.<br/><br/>However, I believe that Season 3 is off to a phenomenal start, with the unique narrative, and multiple timelines created by, renowned author and Show Writer, #NicPizzolatto. Not to mention the dynamic character role of #WayneHays, played by the ever so talented, and extremely multidimensional actor, #MahershalaAli, who I personally believe is one of the best actors of our generation. I could go on with the tremendously well executed performances of the entire Season 3 cast, although I would simply be repeating the same message, pertaining to each of the character's acting abilities and performances thus far. Some have mentioned that Season 3 is a little slow, but given the suspense, I would surmise that looking back, the build up is meant to come across in this manner.<br/><br/>However, I digress. The point I would like to make, is that Season 3 will certainly not disappoint, nor dissatisfy, fans of the True Detective franchise. The real question will be, what twists and turns develop throughout the remainder of the season, and will it eventually be compared to the performance and ratings of the inaugural series plot development from Season 1. Regards, Mark Halsey Only rating season 1.
MAtthew Mcounahey is perfect in this show, one of my favorite performances , very funny interesting character. He's an obsessive detective who uses tons of drugs. He's perfect, though some of his scenes aren't believeable, as this show suffers from the cliches of gritty television, such as lust, trying to pull empathy out of the audience, for Woody Harrelson, who is a very tv show type guy. He's great in it to, though a little less believable. Some of the show is lame, as I've said, dealing with the family life which doesn't really add to the show, it's filler, I'd go as far to say. But the purpose of the show when it's there, and coming through, is epic, that being them as true detectives, being badass, doing drugs and beating people up, being edgy and stuff. I watched only the first season, but without a doubt it was thought-provoking, as there were so much meaning behind this stroy. If we want to understand the real message of this series, we need to look under the surface. Woddy Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey portrayed their role perfectly, the drama between the well-written characters were intensive and authentic. I belive that this story is original, unique and terrifying that is why it is a must-see for everyone. I am not someone who watches TV series a lot. I just watched True Detective's first season in April 2020, which was released in 2014. It has been 6 years since, a lot must have been said about it ... I will only touch a few things that interest me more (at first watching).<br/><br/>In the Season 1, one of the things that attracted my attention most, and frankly the best thing I liked about the series was its fair approach to women and men. You know, in recent years, there has been hostility towards men (they call it misandry) being pumped in the cultural universe in general, and in movies and series in particular. Unfortunately, this approach, which is based on the idea that men dominate the system, women are oppressed, has evolved into "men are bad in essence" in recent years.<br/><br/>This series doesn't have this morbose approach, and perhaps the biggest reason for this is its success in character creation. Characters are not one-dimensional; complex beings who have their own mistakes, shortcomings, good and superior aspects, virtues; they often behave in a way that is expected from them, and unexpectedly at times, like all of us ... This is why the characters feel like so realistic, even like you would bump into one of them just around the corner.<br/><br/>Let's take Marty. Prima facie, he seems like a typical white American guy that loves his job and family and tries to enjoy his life. But is he? He has alcohol problem, he has difficulty in controlling his anger, he loves his family, but he doesn't spend much time with them, he abuses his position as police from time to time, and he cheats on his wife repeatedly. But do you hate the man who does all these things while watching the show? No! Because, you know, he is a good character in essence; he has ups and downs and virtues, as we all do. I couldn't pinpoint the reason in the series, but somehow there is a void in him who tries to fill that void with booze and womanizing. As Marty's somewhere says, Marty's wife Maggie is "a fine woman". But she is also not bestowed favour with positive discrimination by the producers, she is a multidimensional character with her flaws ... Maybe it's a small example but worth giving, she constantly tries to correct her husband with her words or facial expressions like a teacher when they are together at home or elsewhere. This may be one of the things that alienates her husband. But the real problem with Maggie surfaces when she brings herself to the brink of going to bed with a stranger at a bar for revenge and severing all ties with him who betrays her for the second time. Instead, she does but something much worse: she debauches her husband's colleague. You cannot justify your wrongdoings by others' wrongdoings. Since your spouse cheated on you, you cannot just go and betray him/her. Doing this will take you down to his/her level, at best, or even to a worse level as in Maggie's case. But she does it. TD does not victimize the female character and go for a banal emotional exploitation. Maggie is portrayed as a strong woman. This is what I mean when I say the characters in the series are multi-dimensional ones, when I say TD behaves justly in male-female issues.<br/><br/>By the way, the Maggie-Rust affair I mentioned is one of the things I don't find very convincing in the series ... Maggie acts with her desire for revenge and maybe her interest in Rust, which you feel vaguely. However, it was not very convincing that a man like Rust, who was trying to stay away from people in general, especially women, had a relationship with his friend's wife, even though they were at loggerheads with each other the time. The writer and director must have not been very comfortable about this scene anyway, so that Maggie and Rust instantly regret what they have done, one apologizes and the other kicks her out. Yet, sometimes I can't help thinking their regret was actually a result of disappointingly short sexual intercourse - ahahaha just kidding.<br/><br/>One criticism about the series, says producer / writer Nic Pizzolatto, argues that things are not given from the women's point of view. He gives a good answer to this: There are only two people's point of view in this series, events are told and interpreted from the viewpoints of two men, Rust and Marty. "Is the perspective of another male character being given in TD", he asks, "so that a criticism of the absence of women's perspective can be made." He is right!<br/><br/>Another scene that I do not find very convincing is the part where Marty overreacts and kills Ledoux upon seeing the two detained girls. Okay, the man has an anger control problem, he is reminded of his own daughters, but he is a man who has never used his weapon during his career ... But even these not-so-convincing scenes I have mentioned do not bother you so much, because they are not structured as shallow, superficial men. Aren't we all doing unexpected things from time to time?<br/><br/>In the last episode, the moment when Rust bursts into tears is maybe one of the most impressive scenes of the season. Throughout the whole season, a character who does not get emotional once, let alone cry, or even does not really smile once, faces perhaps the first time with the feeling of pain and emptiness created by the death of her daughter, and lets himself go. The last episode is not only where the tension created by events is discharged, but also it is where we witness catharsis of the sorrow and tension built up in Rust throughout the series. This is where you understand what makes Rust that way, what creates the void inside him.<br/><br/>Rust makes philosophy throughout the series, utters big words, questions what is considered normal in that society at that time. At the end of all that beautifully expressed word crowd, the point where he gets to is a another beauty: "It's just one story. The oldest. Light versus dark. (...) Once there was only dark. If you ask me, the light's winning."<br/><br/>This last bit, I think, cannot be interpreted solely as an abstract philosophical reflection. A clear link is being established between the darkness and the things that our heroes have been dealing with from the very beginning, satanism, the abuse and murder of children through satanic rituals. You know, the Satan is also known as the prince of the darkness. Our heroes lighten up us, whispering that the winner will be light/good, not Satan/evil.<br/><br/>When you reach to the end of a good novel, you wish it would never end so you could continue reading. The last episode makes you wish the same thing. Hope that the next season be like season one or more better I've seen seasons 1 and 2. In my opinion, 1 is significantly better, mostly because of the story structure. Each season is a single complex case with a lot of side stories, but in S01 they create an almost equally complex relationship between the two main characters. While the ensamble cast is excellent in s02, it lacks a strong relationship between any of the characters and instead has numerous, somewhat undeveloped ones. It's too bad bc the cast is strong and the background story is interesting, but they are missing that essential component.<br/><br/>I would say season 1 is a must watch, and season 2 is fine, with great actors/actresses, but a weaker story With a very few exceptions, every masterpiece is born through an excruciating process of trial and error. Now, what if that piece was a murder, so immaculate that even after a decade of looking there is anything but nothing! Knowing all these would they be able to stop, or should they? All I can say is the first season can't get any better. It is simply outstanding. I give the first season alone a 10. Second season I didn't make it past the 4th episode. Just not good and really was hard to watch. Vince Vaughn just doesn't work for me at all and he pretty much ruined the few episodes I was able to get through. Not sure if I will even start watching 3rd season because of how lame the 2nd season was. No question the 1st season is totally with watching and "alright alright alright" is just outstanding... I've watched the first season again after 5 years... Oh boy, the EMPTINESS living in me came back alive again. Fantastic character driven detective series. The atmosphere they created along with the drama and the thrill aspect is top notch. I loved the season 1 and season 3. Season 2 is good but not as good as 1.
Nevertheless - a must watch!! This show grabbed my attention and I binged watched one whole first season in one night. Great acting story lines. Can't wait to see season 2 & 3 I know everyone has already said all the good things about this show so I'll skip on the basics and write down why I like it better than any other series.
1. It's a great example of how you can make a character driven show without sacrificing the pace of the main storyline (take notes Doom Patrol).
2. Most character driven shows tend to introduce the characters and their motives first and then give them a storyline. True Detective (s1) does the exact opposite. It introduces the storyline first and then weaves the characters around it. So the show is still about the characters first but the storyline also keeps moving at a steady pace.
3. The show employs an excellent use of intention and obstacle writing technique.
*True Detective is the reality of our world. It depicts a decaying world where the concept of morality is obscure. Based on my personal experience with loneliness, I think it portrays loneliness better than anything else I've seen. Lonely people don't go on murdering politicians (Taxi Driver) or always commit suicide. They find an escape narrative, try to justify that existence is pointless. Every season keeps your attention till the end.
Its keeps you watching Not as good as the first season but much better than the second.
The story was decent, but the characters are the ones that made me come back and see it, that means the acting it's good. I came into this show with a lot of hype behind it, everyone said it's one of the best shows in the last decade and is very highly rated on IMDB (the first season that is, I've heard nothing but bad things about the second so I'm staying away from it). However, while there were many things I liked, I can't say it really lived up to the hype for me. Sure, Woody and Matt bring some great performances to the table (This being the best thing I've ever seen McConaughey in, even though I still loathe him as an actor), and there are some great set pieces scattered throughout the show, but the pacing issues and banality of some aspects of it killed the season for me. <br/><br/>Pacing-wise, after finishing the season it becomes apparent how much time feels wasted in the early half of the show; even though characters are being set up they feel like they're set up the same way constantly (Woody's character develops really well but you understand McConaughey's almost right away and I got very sick of hearing from him after a while). Family drama and characters arguing take up most of the screen time, with the tense shootouts and intriguing detective work being relegated to the last few episodes. I also really loved the cult aspect that was teased at more depth in the last few episodes, but for most of the show it feels more like a plot device than anything more interesting or complex (though this can be down to just what I'm interested in). In terms of banality, compared to many shows I've watched as of late the cinematography and color palette of this show really underwhelmed me with how boring and standard it felt. Compared to a show like Fargo, that can make beautiful and artful shots of a pretty dreary landscape, the Louisiana in this show wasn't very gripping to watch (it didn't need to be cheery, but it should have been more lively).<br/><br/>Overall, I think I was colored by my pre-expectations of the show, and while I didn't end up hating it there was a distinct feeling of disappointment after watching it. If I were to recommend it, I'd say try not to read into it too much beforehand and go into it new. Be ready for a pretty downbeat show; it might appeal to you but I think overall there are shows that have done the same ideas better. One of the best crime dramas I've ever seen on TV. Skillfully made in all aspects. Although the first three episodes are very slow, and brutally depressing, I was hooked from the fourth episode and on when the pace picks up very quickly.
 Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson should star in everything, always - that's how mesmerizing they are as Louisiana criminal investigators in HBO's new anthology True Detective. I had just completed viewing season one, and I am reviewing this anthology series without any knowledge on how the second season went about. McConaughey and Harrelson, with a strong cast of supporting actors make this series binge-worthy. Before proceeding, I have to make it clear that I am a huge fan of detective thrillers. I had just finished viewing Mindhunter's epic first season and the third season of Bosch when I came across this. When I did start viewing, from the get go, the episodes took on a dark tone of storytelling. The non-linear style teleplay also aided in its mysterious aura to a huge extent. All that being said, it truly is a two-men show of Harrelson who whizzes through his scenes with a hint of charm and huge amount of grittiness. McConaughey is exceptional. He plays an emotionless, chain-smoking character whose intentions are made clear with his backstory, not over-developed, but revealed the right amount. Harrelson's character is just the opposite. He plays Detective Hart, a man with loyalty and drinking issues. What happens when these two are paired up, two polarizing characters, to solve a case, its hardships, and how they end up at a closure forms the story. Again, I have no idea on how the second season is, this being an anthology, but it is every bit worth watching for its first season alone and it definitely is great on its own. Do watch it. let me just start by saying to the people that give season 2 a bad rep after watching just 1/2/3 episodes, watch the whole thing before you criticize.<br/><br/>season 1 has a great case with lots of exiting plot points in the story, and between Harrelson and Mcconaughey characters. Great acting all around in the first season. Not much to complain about.<br/><br/>season 2 has a slower beginning, and more disappointing case, and I feel the main focal point is on the characters stories not on the case. Colin Farrel is the best thing about season 2, I think he plays his role perfectly,he looks just like an alcoholic warn down man on the verge of losing everything he has, Vince Vaughn has a great character, you really feel his struggles as well. Mcadams and Kitsch feel a little bland and miss placed although i really like Kitschs backstory. <br/><br/>The biggest difference is obviously the endings, with season 1 almost what i would call a fairytale ending, they catch the bad guy and become friends again and all is well. (except for the mayor not getting caught) And season 2 goes down a darker path with three quarters of the main cast dying in the last episode.<br/><br/>sorry about the bad English it's not my first language. The plot, the cinematography, the perfect length...Everything in this show fits together. I'm talking about the first season btw (first and second season are two different stories). Not that the second season is bad, it's great! But the first season...oh goodie it's good! REALLY GOOD! I really haven't seen anything so well told in any story, whether it's a film, show, video game, or book. The acting and chemistry between Marty and Rusty is phenomenal. The plot will keep you on your toes. THE DIALOGUES ARE OUT OF THIS WORLD. I've watched it 3 times and I still think it's brilliant. Hands down, the best show ever made. It really is something special. Personally I think the first season is the greatest piece of TV drama I have ever seen. Matthew and Woody both give exceptional performances to such a gripping show. it is beautifully shot with awesome scenery. the writing is truly fantastic as it helps you to travel through the journey that these characters live. the story itself is hauntingly brilliant it draws you in. i felt as i was watching just one episode so much would have happened and it would only be half way through the episode it was amazing. that's great TV when you're so drawn in your completely loose track of time because you aren't focused on anything other than whats happening to these characters. The first season of this show was just insanely good and if you haven't watched it yet then don't hesitate to. I went in to this show thinking that I might just watch a little bit of it but I ended up watching season one over the course of one relatively busy day. I just kept going back to it and I have to say it was the best TV watching experience of my life. Everything about the show is just such high quality, from the cinematography, to the acting, to the story line, and it was all shot in some absolutely amazing parts of southern USA. I was invested in every second of this show and even though the end of season 1 was extremely satisfying I was still left wanting more. In a good way though. Overall season 1 would probably be the best show on HBO, even above Game of Thrones, although going by both season 1 and 2 together it would be tough to say that it's the best that HBO has to offer (Not that season 2 is even bad). So yeah, this is an absolute masterpiece. Watch it. I have followed the mystery-detective genre for a couple decades, at least, and I am compelled to say (even though it is unlikely to ever be read by another living soul) that series 1, with Harrelson and McConaughey, is the finest mystery-detective series I have ever seen. The combination of stellar acting and story telling as well as the comprehensive cinematography (which captures the mystery and dark undertones hidden in-plain-sight within the bayou) borders on perfection. I am not a fan of television or movies, in general (which sounds strange, I'm sure) because seldom is it worth the time or effort. This production will forever stand as a benchmark for the genre and for film-making, in general, regardless of budget or venue. Nic Pizzolatto created this crime drama that in the first season focuses on a pair of homicide detectives in Louisiana and a trail of murder, mayhem and mystery that spans 17 years. Featuring the music of T Bone Burnett and All the first eight episodes are directed by Cary Fukunaga, the series opens in 1995 as Martin Hart (Woody Harrelson) and Rust Cohle (Matthew McConaughey), are called to the scene of a gruesome, ritualistic killing of a young woman, Fast-forward to 2012, Hart and Cohle are grilled by another pair of detectives (Tory Kittles, Michael Potts) who are investigating a case that bears striking similarities to the one before. In between is a glimpse of 2002, when Hart and Cohle struggled to deal with their inner demons in separate but equally destructive ways. <br/><br/>Just to start of this review i have to say this. The first season of True Detective is the greatest piece of television ever produced. No but really I personally love the first season I have watched the first eight episodes four times already. But what is it that makes it so impressive, is that it feels more like a long Hollywood movie than a television show. It has such a constant tone thru out the whole season; it doesn't change writer or director which really benefits project. The A-list actors also brings something amazing and referencing. I think both Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson gave their careers strongest performance on this show and also gave us two of the best characters to ever grace the small screen. Rusty is a personal idol, his philosophical discussions and long speeches about life, is engaging and some of greatest dialog to ever appear on both television and in films. <br/><br/>From its horrifying storyline, that does not shy away from the horrors of life but at the same time does not give you shock for the shock value sake. Pizzolatto gives you a realistic and dark story that feels real by not giving the audience some lame explanatory dialog that give you every answer. Oh no, True Detective's beauty lies in giving you just enough information so that you can put the pieces together for yourself. On the outside it might look like cop show, but not your regular a show about cops doing police work, and police work is not all shootouts and car chases. Even though there are some big action moments in the first season, like the six- minutes-tracking-shot or the final. All the action sequences are probably some of best ever seen on TV. Regardless of these amazing action sequences, most of the show is Rust and Marty interviewing people and them dealing with their lifes. Despite both the cop drama and the terrific action in the end of the day it's about two broken men dealing with their demons. <br/><br/>Even though Pizzolatto's writing and storytelling is so unique and fascinating. It all comes down to the execution. I think that's what season one got right and season two got wrong. Even though i don't hate season two, and is one of the few people who actually defends season two for what it is. But by no means do i love it like i do season one. The problem with season two was that it worked as a regular television series. True Detective is no regular television series! At least not season one. Season one was one long movie an eight part movie! With the same director, writer, cast and crew! That's it biggest strength. Nic Pizzolatto did not understand this, so for the second season he used different directors for every episode, and a different crew. <br/><br/>But speaking of directors, now we have come down to my absolute favorite part of season one of True Detective, Cary Joji Fukunaga. It's thanks to Fukunaga the first season is gorgeous looking, all the long takes and helicopter shots that really, gives Louisiana an personality. Louisiana itself is a character in the show. Fukunaga elevated Pizzolatto already amazing scripted, by his amazing directing, also want to give a shout out to the director of photography, Adam Arkapaw. Fukunaga and Arkapaw are the ones that make True Detective's first season to the greatest piece of TV to have ever been produced. I mean much credit to all the actors in the series especially Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson they are also a huge part of the success, but in the end of the day you can replace them and the show still be great. But if you replace Fukunaga and Arkapaw, well then you get season two... <br/><br/>I think that's why you can with such confident say that the success lay in the hands of Fukunaga and Arkapaw. As said before i really enjoy Nic Pizzolatto writing, I have read his book Galveston (strongly recommend reading it). But by watching season two you can also feel that Pizzolatto's writing and dialog gets really confusing and stupid in the wrong hands. Season two tries to keep some of season one's tone in some aspects, but it really just feels like a cheap rip-off of Cary Fukunaga style. I think we would have gotten a very different and significantly better season two, if show runner Nic Pizzolatto had decided to keep the season one team. <br/><br/>To conclude this review, I only have to say this True Detective is one the most well-written show in recent times. But above all else it looks better than anything on TV! I mean Breaking Bad and Fargo have been pushing the cinematic on TV for years but i think True Detective did it the best. True detective is one of those rare shows that when you are watching it you never want it to end. I have watched the first season four times and still fu**cking love it every time. The current tally on reviews is at 9.3 out of 10, which I think is the highest I've ever seen on the website. <br/><br/>Yes, it's a 9.3. That's all you need to know. Just watch it.<br/><br/>Harrelson and McConaghey are pitch perfect in every scene. The story line is complex, compelling, and works like a fine watch. I watched the entire Season 1 in one sitting, and was sorry when it ended because there won't be any more. So the effect was basically one of watching an eight hour movie. Not a dull moment in the entire production. <br/><br/>Extra credit trivia: Without looking it up, see if you can spot the actor who also appears in Orange Is The New Black. Normally , I don't do reviews or recommendations until and unless the series has reached it's Finale , but me doing this thing right now.. definitely has reasons attached to it and those reasons aretrust me..worthwhile. I couldn't stop myself from sharing the awesomeness with you guys , frankly put.;) I never thought I would watch a TV series as soon as a season is out , I usually wait for a couple of seasons at least , coz yeah , I have a tendency of "not-able-to -stop" myself from getting enough of the stuff I like. So , yeah I am definitely choosy when it comes to a TV-Series , not like movies. Everyone sometime in their lives has a head on collision with a crappy movie .and God save those Poor souls, who undergo this collision quite frequently than the others. Seriously , God save 'em! So , yeah enough of the this & that stuff , In straight simple words without much use of some real tough words selected pretty selectively from the "Damn-is –that –even –a-word" section from the English Dictionary, I would with no hesitation , simply like to state " True detective is a purely class defining masterpiece , from HBO".HBO does it yet again!.. ' coz I don't know it's just me or there are others who believe/think that most of the shows being aired on HBO are nothing less than pure Gold. After the Oscar fame , Mathew McConaughey has just nailed it. His performance as Detective Rust Cohle, his lines , even the look or stare he has in eyes in various scenes are just Top-Notch and crafted to perfection. Man , he is a fantastic actor. He is definitely one of the best Fictional detective characters for sure. Then comes his partner Detective Marty Hart played by Woody Harrelson , and his acting skills are no news for us. As usual he makes us believe that there's no one suited for this role than him. And this show is about the lives of two Detectives who are in for a hunt for a Serial Killer for 17 years and their lives being affected by their duty. The creator Nic Pizzolato is just brilliant to come up with this masterpiece. The complete cast of this show are so well chosen and they stand up to the expectations as well. Rusty(McConaughey's character) is so believable and a complete detective material , he is miserable yet disciplined and determined to catch the Killer. Marty (Harrelson's character) is not exactly opposite to him , but lacks a lil. control over his needs but then again he is a great detective and takes his job pretty seriously. And the way these two get along throughout is simply a treat to watch. Watch it to know and feel ,what I am talking about. So to conclude , "True detective is sleek , hardcore ,engaging ,suspenseful, dark , nasty and for most of the viewers it is gonna turn out to be a definite instant masterpiece/classic. And yeah it's a murder mystery too..:p" P.S. – Right from the opening titles you are hooked 'coz the theme song has a thing that sets your mood right away. Dark and a deep kinda feel to it. And there's the characters and the plot which is going to suck you right in. Looking forward to the next season with a never before felt anxiety and hope. It was great fun to watch. I set the expectation bar quite high for this series but wasn't disappointed. It was greatest psycho killer hunt ever, it even took a leap over Silence of the lambs. The cult killings has been depicted very finely, which are enough to spook one. The new thing is that the story starts from mid-way not from the start, this makes anticipation all the more difficult. Direction and cinematography are great, they haven't failed in giving the story a proper direction.Better background sounds/music could be more supportive to the scary parts. Story is very good, but the way it has been conveyed through the scenes tells that the director did complete justice with it. And lastly the acting, the lead cast could not been better. Matthew and Wood did their usual out of the box stuff, which is unfathomable. Over all I would say,it was all in all awesome. Starting 2 episodes are little bit slow but one can't bear to leave it after that. I would recommend this to the classic thriller lovers. My first review ever and i thought it would be for Birdman..here I am instead and damn glad that this here is my first!.,for I was about to write a review for , in my view , a fairly decent effort on all fronts for Birdman .. True Detective, Wow!!..decent is an understatement...<br/><br/>This series has an even glow to it. From the Handsome family's Far From Any Road, the soundtrack as the opening credits rolled, I knew this series would be epic..luckily for me..I did not have to wait patiently for all the episodes as I discovered "True Detective" by accident..a month after the finale ..and I watched all of the episodes in one sitting..and i did it again and again for a week straight..My wife thought I'd gone nuts..anybody would..but once she watched the first episode , she did the True detective marathon..<br/><br/>Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson act out of their skin..the fact that Matthew McConaughey in preparation for his role as Detective Rust wrote a 450 page character sketch study paper , that says it all. you will not recognize the actor because his character, Detective Rust is the real deal. Explosive performances by these two and supported by a great cast,even the extras are exceptional in their art.<br/><br/>Nic Pizzolatto, his writing and creativeness just oozes class. The Direction by Cary Joji Fukunaga , dark but perfect..to say the least,zero flaws and a statement made. If only i could rate them higher than 10!!.. The Franklin Scandal. Larry King. This program is by far one of the best "fictional" broadcasts relating to child abductions.<br/><br/>Chiefs, a 1983 series was the first. In a twist of irony one of the leads/actors in that series was, and is a child molester. I won't give his name but if you search for Chiefs the series on YouTube you can see the series. It's chilling.<br/><br/>It was also the TV series that set standards for sexual innuendo or more importantly the crime of child kidnapping as a subject that had and has been ignored for far too long.<br/><br/>This series is almost a carbon copy of the Franklin Savings and Loan scandal of the late '80s. But with a somewhat happy ending. <br/><br/>I suggest you get the book(s) regarding the Franklin scandal from just about any e-book service. You can also see the quashed doc. that the Discovery Channel commissioned. It's a rough cut episode but telling. I was curious to watch True Detective because it was the direct rival of Breaking Bad for many nominees in the last Grammy Awards. It's certainly a different genre as True Detective is more a mystery story and it has definitely less humor than the series with Bryan Cranston. However, the first 4 or 5 episodes of the series definitely lack pace and suspense since the plot is more introspective and it focuses on the dialogs between the two main characters, masterfully played by Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey, and on their personalities. In my opinion the spectator gets really into the show in the last 2 or 3 episodes, when the plot gets more mysterious and interesting. Two more features I liked about this series are: the opening soundtrack and the way the South is depicted, with its characters and its landscapes. McCoughagy should have "I work for big tobacco" on the back of his jacket instead of COP. THE GUY SMOKES SOOOO MUCH !! The script is dull, stilted, and all over the place. The continuity person should be fired. Check out when McCoughagy checks out the corpse, gloves on/gloves off. No gloves at the autopsy.I don't like to fault Harrelson, but his character is dull as dishwater and even though he's married, he's unable to bring off a semblance of normal. The storyline is so disjointed it's hard, or pointless to follow. I see it's getting high praise from some quarters, but the reviewers must be getting paid. Another flop series, I won't watch another episode. Having read the previews on this one and knowing HBO's stellar record of producing hit shows, I was expecting big things. HBO did not disappoint. <br/><br/>The show immediately grabbed my attention and it never let me go. What I love about the show is the atmosphere, mid 1990s, very rural area in the South. Harrelson and Mcconaughey have real chemistry and it is clear that this is one of Mcconaughey's best performances. He plays a dark mysterious detective and you just know this guy knows something that no one else does. Harrelson is equally impressive playing the more mainstream detective. <br/><br/>I can't wait to see the rest of the series. spoilers!!! So far great show... in second episode I heard about the king in yellow,Carcosa and black stars.... I was blown away..... cant wait for the next one. So far very very promising... dark, melancholic just the way I like it. MM and WH are doing great job here and I respect them a lot... MM can do romantic comedies and he can do stuff like this which makes him a great actor..the same with WH. Ritual murders, strange cults all that have Lovecraft written on the wall and being a huge Lovecraft fan I can just hope this show go that way. the show is realistic enough to show or 2 "heroes" with some flows like having an affair or doing drugs. And their relationship is great too. They don't like each other very much not like in some shows where they become best friends right away. the only thing I would like to chance is that story goes with little more speed... but I am not complaining though. Mahershala Ali is GOLD! He is no stranger to smooth roles, but he is PERFECT in True Detective season 3! S1 was great. You can skip S2. S3 is amazing if not better than S1. I disagree with negative reviews for S3. I get that usual binge audience may not like it. This is not your typical crime story. This is a fine mix of crime/investigative work and human drama with a great storyline and dialogues. The pace was about right and didn't feel like slow-moving. If you only interested in the investigative outcome and tend to become impatient then don't watch it. Every single actor including M Ali did justice to their character. I wouldn't watch in the daytime :) Look forward to S4. I cant say anything bad about the show som far. Im glued...
I dont understand people who say they liked season one, but not this one. Come on.
This is precisely what Ive been waiting for since the previous season. Slowpaced? Ok sure, reminds me of season one. Mahershala is great in this role, I had my doubts about Stephen Dorff, but he does a great job as well. Cant really complain about anyones acting.
The time-hopping doesnt mind me at all. Keeps my mind going on what really happened and how it will all end up. And besides, its only been three episodes and it gives me the same feel as season one did, tragic, gritty and dark. The narrative also feels more like the first season, at least way better than season two. So, yeah, Im hooked. Series 2 should be forgotten, end of. After the perfection of the 1st series, then the deflating 2nd series. I hoped series 3 would get back on track. Thankfully it has exceeded ALL expectations and more. This show isn't for everyone. It's a masterclass in writing, acting, cinematography, direction, everything that a crime drama should be. Savour every episode. TV doesn't get much better than this. True Detective is an absolutely brilliant show! McConaughey and Harrelson are a brilliant pairing and the writing is brilliant, kudos to Pizzolatto and Fukunaga. I love the dark, creepy feel to it and it looks visually stunning. I love the fact that it's basically an 8-hour film and that it looks like a film. This series has made McConaughey one of my favourite actors and if you're not convinced by his Oscar win, you should of course see Dallas Buyers Club, but also definitely watch True Detective because it just shows how much of a brilliant actor he is! The story is dark, creepy, weird, and very interesting. Four episodes have aired so far in the UK and I can't wait to see how it pans out! And can't wait for season 2 even though McConaughey and Harrelson won't be in it. I just hope Pizzolatto can carry on the excellent writing and they can get another director just as good, if not better, than Cary Fukunaga! Series 1 great,
Series 2 wat was that
Series 3 utter crap Sorry to all the fanboys out there that latched onto the Mcconologues of the 1st season, but it is true. Vince Vaughn and Colin Farrell delivered the most prolific performances of their CAREERS! Vaughn is always type-casted as a quick smart-a$$ comedian, so the show went out of it's way to put that silliness to an end. There is no room in True Detective for a cynical dbag, and thats what they made sure of. The plot was not confusing if you paid any attention to the Vinci superiors, or to the blatant foreshadowing that Woodrough and Velcoro were going to die! How could you possible miss obvious signs that Blake, Oseph, and Pitler were working together against Casper, they all had EXTREMELY close connections to Caspere! Blake admitted that he was partying with Oseph! Pitler was connected to Chessani's dead ex-wife, and counseled Caspere and provided him girls! Mayor Chessani's daughter, tells Ani and Velcoro (in the hookah lounge) that Toni and Caspere always talk on the phone together! Are you people brain-dead? If you thought this plot was confusing, then you should go back to rating movies like SEVEN, where they knock you over the head with the ending 20 minutes into the movie. This season was about political corruptions and under-handed deals with criminal organizations. That in itself is confusing! I'm glad Pizzolatto made this season a bandwagon killer, too many people are suckers for happy-story-tale endings i.e. Season 1. Did you know Rustin Cohle was originally supposed to die? But no, they re-wrote that, because of all of the imbeciles that latched onto his father-figure character would cry their eyes out. Why on Earth does season 2 catch such a bad-wrap, but childish shows like Game of Thrones (a complete rip from The Skyrim video game) receive such holy praise from all the neck-beards and and losers out there? I cannot say that I was in awe after any of the first three episodes. The character is somewhat imitation of Dr. Gregory House - just transposed into a different occupation. Problem is, Dr. House was a brilliant man, but here we are still waiting for the brilliance of Rust Cohle. The script contains mostly the philosophy of Detective Rust, which are by no means original, and kinds of boring as the story is not going anywhere. It felt like, the director and script writers are trying to sell the philosophy, and adding a bit extra twist here and there. McConaughey is otherwise a good actor, but I also felt that he needs to 'believe' what he is talking about. May be a different cast would make this character more dark, which was probably the goal in the first place. In a nut shell, if you have nothing else to do, you can check this one out. But do not expect much, cause there is not much. The level of true detective come back to normal,even though the whole story is not clear enough after episode two. We enjoyed the first season. But this second season with Vaughn and Farrell was almost unwatchable.
All those disfunctional characters! Too much psycholology, not enough action. Did every character have an unhappy childhood? Did everyone need a shrink? Did everyone need to drink and smoke in every scene? Ugh. There was no clever charm in this story whatsoever, a waste of the viewer's time. We could not finish it. The biggest problem with season 3 for me is this guy Mahershala Ali. I cannot understand much of what he is saying. English is my first language so there's no reason why I and others should be struggling with this. Not only can I not understand what much of he is saying but he talks in such a boring and monotone way I tend to zone out. He doesn't pull me in to the story he kicks me out! His acting is terrible too I really think he's out of his depth here. I wanted to like this movie, in fact i desperately tried because this movie has a high ratings. But throughout the movie i just kept dozing off because it was so slow and boring. I watched this 3 season because all the fake the raving hype reviews. I thought season 1 was really really good. While Season 2 was perhaps the worst I've ever seen in a long while. Complete trash. So I went In with this new season without any expectations or hype. I watched it and I thought it was a boring conundrum of twitchy flashbacks and diffuse storytelling.
True Decieving should be its name. My main issues Is how cheaply excetuted it all feels. They never show anything that could lift an exciting scene tremendeously. When the guy kicks in the boobytrapped door for instance. There's no mature or R rated scenes at all. That gives certain scenes gravitas and impact.
And yet many says this is dark and brooding but its nowhere near the first season. Its a sleepy, yawning serie where everyone talks vague and try to sound intellectual. Its really annoying and badly written cause nobody talks like this!! No adult ever talks like this! It's like theyre all reading lines from a book and so many times i get pulled off because what the robots just say? and It makes absolutely no sense at all. I love slowburn noir darkness, gothic americana, ta in peaks esque movie magic And the setup and story here is great. Its nothing wrong with the actual murder mystery. Its just hos they choose to film it that is a complete snoozefest. The more i watch the more i want to turn it off and do more important things.
So! Conclusion! We have one flawless great season. And the other 2 are really really bad. Stale. Boring. Makes no sense.
So true detective should land on a 4. Season 1:<br/><br/>Easily one of the best series of all-time. The on-screen chemistry of Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey was just incredible and was made even better with some of the greatest dialogue I've ever heard in a show. The mystery/crime behind the show was also captivating and super entertaining - despite being a little confusing at times. Just an absolute great series.<br/><br/>10/10 It doesn't get much better than this. Absolutely stellar cast. Great plot. I could not stop watching . As much as I was charmed to the 1st season, I felt so disappointed in the 2nd one. It's as if the directors never realised what was good about season 1.
The relationship and conversations between woody and mathew are hilarious, the way the show is presented like pulp fiction, very enjoyable.
However the actual "crime/case" part of the story, bit of a let down, but could't care less.
Season 2 just dull, nothing interesting about it. How can the same show runner create something so good and then follow it up with something so bad?! Time pressure? Perhaps after the hiatus he will come up with another masterpiece. (TIP: casting is paramount, miscasting can ruin the show). Being a film & TV student during high school unfortunately whenever I watch something I analyze it, even if I don't want/mean to. That being said, watching this series has surprised me as to how good it is compared to the first season. The one thing I respect is the continuity and thought process put into the characters. The best example I can give is when, (Spoiler alert?) they storm the cabin in the woods in Episode 8, Vince Vaunghn's character is a gangster, and Colin Farrell's character is an ex-cop, the gangster sprays anything and everything that runs out the front door of the cabin, where as the ex-cop uses precise aim and burst fire shots. It might not seem like much to the general viewers but anyone who knows a thing or two about continuity and has a general concept of military tactics should be impressed just for the writer's/or even the director's thought process about this.<br/><br/>(To me the little details are what makes the difference between a good piece of film and a spectacular piece of film.) ~Liam. I don't think a TV show has ever managed to keep me watching with the same enthusiasm and vigor from the first minute of the first episode till the very last minute of the season finale.<br/><br/>True Detective has.<br/><br/>All credit must be given to novelist turned screenwriter Nic Pizzolatto for writing an almost impeccable script that reintroduces film noir to television – a genre which is already disappearing in cinema. If you are not familiar with film noir it can be summed up in one word: manipulation. The screenwriter emotionally and intellectually manipulating the viewers into following a certain narrative that might prove misleading in the end, characters manipulate themselves and each other, and motives are manipulated to create insolvable moral conflicts. True Detective starts with two people separately speaking to a cam recorder (a self-referential tool evoking surveillance and governance). They speak about each other and relate to us events that happened in the past. Pizzolatto makes it clear to us that we will be manipulated whether we like it or not – our access to the truth is limited by mediation and conflicted sources. In the second episode, Detective Martin Hart (played by Woody Harrleson) states: "It goes on like that. . . you're looking for narrative, interrogate witnesses, parcel evidence, establish a timeline, build story.. day after day." This is what Pizzolatto does, what Detective Martin Hart and Detective Rustin cohle (played by Matthew McConaughey) do, and what we do to ourselves as well.<br/><br/>Something else makes Pizzolatto's script really smart. I'm not going to talk about the dialogue which is honestly the best I have seen in years – nobody can disagree with me on that one. It is the attention to details infallibly strikes a balance between reality and fiction. Characters are so real yet so engaging; real because of all their weaknesses and uncertainties, and engaging because of the cloud of cynicism shrouding their judgments and their world. Usually writers sacrifice the realness of their characters for the sake of making them likable; however, Pizzolatto has masterfully avoided that pitfall in creating Hart and Cohle's characters. Detective Hart is an unfaithful family man and Detective Cohle is a cynical sociopath (a typical hero of the film noir genre), yet you can't help but fall in love with both of them. This is due of course to Harrleson and McConaughey's first-class performance and the unmistakable chemistry between them. Pizzolatto is to be thanked for that too; he cared about the vertical dimension of characters as much as the horizontal. In other words, his characters are not only deep and complicated but also move forward naturally over time. The story time is very tricky; it goes 17 years in the past and moves slowly to our present time. To follow characters' progress without making them look too sloppy or too rigid requires a lot of talent, a hell lot of it. The perfect tempo of the narrative also helps in this smooth character development.<br/><br/>Enough with Pizzolatto – my infatuation is clearly getting out of control!<br/><br/>Before True Detective I wasn't really a fan of Matthew McConaughey, and I think that makes my opinion a little bit less biased. If you can imagine a Doctor Gregory House without the sense of humor then you might get close to who Detective Rustin Cohle is. Playing a cynical nihilist is not an easy job, and rendering him somehow lovable makes the job even harder. McConaughey studied his role well and took it to the heart that I can't imagine anybody else as Rust. He picked up Pizzolatto's love for details and literally grew into and with his character, with all its weakness, strength, despair, rigidity, frustration... etc. I can say with a clear conscience that McConaughey's performance in True Detective has secured him a place among the finest actors of his generations, something that has been previously stated in Mud (2012) and Dallas Buyers Club (2013).<br/><br/>The choice of soundtracks greatly participated in making my experience of watching the show truly unique. The country/classic songs are carefully picked and hit in the right places and in the right times. The opening credit song for example, The Handsome Family's Far From Any Road, has taken a firm grip of my heart and hasn't let go ever since.<br/><br/>Now back to Pizzolatto (I'm hopeless I know!). The ending of the show is the reason why I referred to it earlier as "almost impeccable." It is not how Rust gave up his appealing cynicism that let me down, it's how the monster hunt ended. It was too theatrical for the overall tone of the show. Too showy. Too grotesque. I nearly ended up regretting them catching the bad guy. Pizzolatto has deliberately stepped into the pitfall I mentioned earlier. Why? I have no idea!<br/><br/>I haven't watched season two yet, but I like the idea of having fresh new characters and narratives – it keeps the good blood pumping. All I can do now is wait and pray <br/><br/>Please, Nic, don't let me down!<br/><br/>***************<br/><br/>True Detective (Season 2): Not Bad. Just Too Bad It's Still Called True Detective<br/><br/>God knows how hard I have tried not to compare Nic Pizzolatto's second season of True Detective with its predecessor, but I failed miserably. I am truly sorry, Nic! You cannot just create two stories under the same name and expect people not to compare them. Humanity is weaker than that you know.<br/><br/>Read more here:<br/><br/>https://thecinemalair.wordpress.com/2015/08/13/true-detective- season-2-not-bad-just-too-bad-its-still-called-true-detective/ OK, everybody wrote similar things but this is what TD season-2 gives you as a feeling. Especially after an unbelievable S1.<br/><br/>S1 was something different. IF you like football, you can only compare this to watching Messi play (err, in Barcelona anyway, not national team!). You always expect something spectacular and see it all the time.<br/><br/>Then came S2. My expectations were not too high, because two leading powerhouses from S1 was gone... but nevertheless I didn't expect such lame characters and storyline! There's only one thing I can say - and you can guess the rest; the best actor on S2 is Vince Vaughn. Yes, like a joke right? But unfortunately all other actors seem to be told "be as shallow and antipathetic as you can be" and they listened to this advice.<br/><br/>Season 3 EDIT: For the first time I had to change a higher note (10) to lesser (5) because it seems Season-1 was a coincidence.<br/><br/>And guess what... even Season 2 seems very good now! A review of season 1. This series in it's first season is as groundbreaking and mind-blowing as they say it is. There's something to be said for shows that don't treat their audience like morons. It tells the story of two detectives working to solve a strange crime. The detectives are Rust and Marty. The first is cerebral, objective, authentic, the other genital, narcissistic, hypocritical. Rust lives in an apartment with a mattress on the floor and crime books. Marty is married to a fine woman out of his league but he can't keep himself from cheating on her, usually with gorgeous younger girls who are even more out of his league. As we meet them initially in the present, they are being interviewed or questioned separately by two cops. What sounds like a straightforward interview quickly becomes a confession for both of them as they spill their guts. Rust looks like a wreck, chain-smokes and chain-drinks, Marty looks like he's doing alright. The questions quickly focus on Rust, and Marty is more than happy to deliver all sorts of gossip.<br/><br/>We are taken to a crime scene in the 90s for a crime that looks straight out of Hannibal. A girl was found dead, naked, bound and kneeling in front of a tree, with cuts on her abdomen, antlers on her head, and a spiral drawn on her back. Nearby there are several little figures made of branches. Channeling Det. Wagenbach from The Shield, Rust immediately suspects it's a serial killer although there are no other bodies or reports. The investigation moves very slowly with few leads. The police and city brass are getting antsy and warn that they'll hand the investigation over to a task force if there are no results soon. But Rust does manage to discover another victim with similar signs, that helps them advance. Halfway through the season they find someone who might be responsible but things end on a complicated note that doesn't really help much.<br/><br/>Still, Rust and Marty are considered heroes. Rust becomes an expert interrogator able to get a confession out of all suspects. During one such confession the suspect mentions the crime of the girl from years ago, and hints that they didn't get the everyone involved after all. That drives Rust nearly mad an he embarks on a mission to find whoever bears responsibility. He has a falling out with Marty and leaves the police force but keeps looking.<br/><br/>That's why the two cops are so interested in him. They have a new crime, similar to the one of the girl and they have evidence of Rust showing up at crime scenes. Now we are taken to the present. Marty is a private investigator. Rust reaches out and asks for help in the investigation. He's got a storage unit with all the info, files, videotapes, etc. He's been tracking disappearances of kids all along the coast where some church has been placing schools. But it's actually Marty who makes a connection that no one has before. And eventually they will confront the bad guy.<br/><br/>The story is told in an intricate way. There are 3 or 4 intertwined time periods here. There are names of victims, suspects, and their relatives. Some aspects of the main investigation are a little odd as when Rust decides to infiltrate a motorcycle gang he used to work previously in order to get to the guy who cooks their drugs. Surely there must have been easier ways to get info from these guys. There's the initially lame aspect of Marty's marriage but I did like how the script connected it with the rest of the story and made it meaningful. Of note is that every episode ends in a narrative cliffhanger leaving you begging for more. However, there are some weak spots to the story and how it is told. The series builds up a lot of expectation toward the resolution. As often happens though with such a built-up, no resolution could fulfill the viewer's inflated expectation. And so it is here. When the penultimate episode sort of reveals the culprit you're left a little disappointed. Even more, so when we learn more about him in the final episode.<br/><br/>The setting of Louisiana is fantastic, both gorgeous and occasionally creepy. Speaking of creepy this season really manages to get under your skin in a way that Silence of the Lambs did and Hannibal does, and it actually has one scene that I found quite frightening.<br/><br/>It's the character of Rust here that shines and in particular his lines--a pessimist, nay, nihilist to the bone, who gives long philosophical diatribes often based on Nietzsche of course. Hollywood still hasn't managed to find another philosopher in 2500 years of history. Schopenhauer, an inspiration to Nietzsche and often considered the philosopher of pessimism would have been a useful resource. As with all intellectually inclined people, the rest of the population wants to hear none of it as Rust isn't exactly a messenger of light. People would rather be undisturbed and happy in the cave. So it's common that those surrounding Rust tell him to shut up. For an intellectual he's uncommonly chatty though. There is no shortage of great lines and it's no surprise the are plenty of sites listing Rust quotations. Of interest though is how Rust does manage to overcome his nihilism in the end, and it's well handled, and the solution is indeed one the answers to the challenge of meaninglessness.<br/><br/>It's a shame there will be no continuity with the story as they really have something here with season 1, namely an entire mythology that was only hinted at and never fully worked out. Had I a say in production, I would take advantage of it and have the villain in the finally minutes of the final episode of season 2 say something about the Yellow King or Carcosa--right before he's hit by a bullet from somewhere. The first five episodes of this show are phenomenal. That doesn't mean the last few episodes aren't. It's just the idea that the writers put in your head through the first five episodes of what the show might be is really what I enjoyed most. The performances are wonderful, the characters are deeply layered, the dialog is fantastic, and the story is interesting and creepy as it sucks you in having you pondering what kind of show True Detective really is. Is it something more than your usual cop drama? Is there something supernatural to this story? By episode six you start to realize that you've been over thinking things. This is really just a story about two men, one who refuses to accept the great hand of cards he's been dealt, and another who's loss of wife and daughter have lead him to a life of nihilism and depression. By the end you enjoy what the two men have become and the unique friendship they've made but are left wanting more in terms of subplots and back-story. There are a significant number of red hearings in this show that get you thinking it's going somewhere it's not leaving the finale feeling a bit underwhelming compared to far more interesting audience theories. This show is truly a bromance more than a whodunit. As for Rust Cohle(Matthew McConaughey)'s character specifically, it's more about him finding light in a world he sees as filled with darkness. As for their portrayals it's hard to beat the heart-felt performances from Woody Harrelson and McConaughey. I expect both actors to receive Emmy nominations at the least for their portrayals.<br/><br/>If you can get past the idea that you think the show is headed towards and see it for what it really is, a gritty crime drama mostly focused on the darkness of the main characters, it really is a well-directed and great show that keeps you asking what happens next. Just don't expect it to be anything unexpected or mind blowing as the story leads on in the beginning. I've always looked at Matthew McConaughey as just a pretty boy dreadful Rom-Coms like "Failure to Launch", but he's been absolutely astonishing in this role as Russ, on par with the kinds of characters dredge up from the gloom by Christian Bale.<br/><br/>Woody Harrelson's doing a good job as a foil and back drop for McConaughey. But while I think McConaughey could easily play Harrelson's role without missing a beat, I just can't see Harrelson carrying off the role of Russ with the same cool mystery that McConaughey is bringing.<br/><br/>Amazing performance ... Exceptionally awful , predictable and ludicrous leaves you sleepy and angry and with a sense that you just have lost several precious hours from your life. Both main actors(from season 1) seem to be there for the paycheck and seem to want to get the hell out of set as soon as possible. One of them is depressed because his child died and his wife left ( how very original) the other one is married to woman who looks like a model but tends to have an affair just because. Even the intro is boring and predictable I could immediately guess that the series would involve a psycho killing women ( again how very original) . And what's with people of Louisiana depicted as creepy ass hats again and again haven't we had it in true blood the originals ? I loved Seazon 3! But I also love Seasons 1 & 2. Don't compare these between each other! It is a mistake. They're independent and they stand alone...and yes they are different because that's how life is! Beautiful work in all True detective series. S3 aimes and hits a very high note and leaves you with you with a warm feeling and beautiful understanding of ...life really and love. Well done! I binged watched season 1 because it was so good. MM and WH were in their zone in acting. The story was dark and brooding a good adult detective story. The writing was top notch. I didn't really watch season 2 and what people said about it was probably true. They seem to have had a different formula going with season 2 that just didn't really click with people..after the greatness of season 1, season 2 was a little bit of a let down. I am watching season 3 and I think it is really good also. They went back to the old formula as season 1 and the writing has reflected it. Some people say it is boring..I don't find it to be that. It is a slow burn to the story telling which I really love...It takes place in Arkansas around Natural Dam.....and I found it awesome because I recognized the area where they filmed it....I live just a couple of miles from where this was filmed....the fictional town is my town and they used a lot of the buildings we have...that made the story more pleasant to watch... I did like the first series but thought there was more hipe than substance. Although the negative reviews I thought the second series had a much better storyline and was acted so well by the cast. WTH THE most stupid ending.
Way to
Go
Stupid
Writers.
I don't know how to
End the stupid series. 3 sezon really bad,it's so bored and not interesting... it would be better to do nothing new after the first season. Going into the final episode my impression of the series was a bit tepid largely because there were so many loose ends to tie up and indeed that did impose a strain on the final episode. However, despite that, the great artistry of the final episode largely canceled out those concerns and as the series ended I was left a bit breathless. Without giving any spoilers I will just say that the final minutes blew me away with what I feel was their artful execution. What is great about season 3 and season 1 as well is the artistry of the writing and direction and the interplay of the lead characters. The story itself is merely the vehicle to put those attributes on display. My 2 cents....... I loved the first season of True Detective, but season two is my favorite television series ever. I will not spoil anything because I hope this review encourages people to go back and watch it again. There are a lot of people who believe the series ended with too many loose-ends, but I can assure you it did not. I viewed every episode twice and there are subtle prophecies/foreshadowing that are easy to miss. Also, if you pay attention closely (and I advise turning on closed captions) a lot is revealed in the finale. It is a convoluted show and not meant to be viewed without close attention. Bravo Nic for making me use my brain and not giving in to outside influences or trying to reproduce season 1. I will close by stating that the casual viewer probably misidentified the main antagonist. Astonishing and brilliant series, Harrelson and Mcconaughey at their primes. Emmy and Golden Globes will be knocking on the door of this series.The only flaw that i see is that the series should have been extended to 10 episodes at least, for me this series was addictive,contagious from the very beginning. I saw some people in others sites complainting about TV quality "resolution",Cary Fukunaga told us before the series was on air that he filmed with 35 mm film gauge not digital cameras or the like, so, we were warned about that. mCCONAUGHEY officially withdraws fron season 2 , so i seriously doubt that season 2 would be with the same quality and flattering that season 1. It get's a 10 for the first season, then when I don't see Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson it just turns in to a...s..! ...,thous 2 where perfect!!!!!!!!!!
Afterwards the movie seams to have no sence.. I really enjoyed seasons 1 and 2. However, season 3 is a huge disappointment, without going into the plot, all I can say the lack of action is quite disappointing. I just want to give this show 10, especially the latest season. But season 2 is really just garbage. Low on action but very riveting. As much as I was so so fan of first 2 seasons, Season 3 is spectacular. Worth watching, especially if you are enjoy that genre. ​This is my first review on IMDb. Anyway I started this show by looking at good ratings. The first season didn't disappoint despite the fact that it took pace only after 3rd episode. Overall I would give 1st season 9.5/10. After watching the 1st season I had my hopes high. But that was temporary. I started the first episode, and it was not making any sense. I thought maybe just like 1st season it will​ pace up after few episodes. But guess what, I was wrong. I successfully wasted my 10 hours figuring out what was happening. I think even the writers for 2nd season don't know what is happening. So I would rate it 6/10. Just finished watching True detective season 2 and I don't get all the feud and criticism towards the comparison to the 1st season! "People saying the 1st season was art, and second it's only good police thriller drama... every body was in love with idea of a second season with new story, new characters, but soon as they got just that! They start complaining how different it was towards the 1st season, the mood, the look, and so, and so on... I mean, this what we all want in the 1st place, right!! Look I loved the 1st season as much as anybody, but the second season stands on his on feet. I think it benefit from going to a more urban story, and it's just puzzled as the first one (in a good way) and I think the characters are terrific. <br/><br/>It's just like the great scene in the end on the desert (++ Spoiler alert++) one of the best TV moments in recent years, that's art! So instead of saying we want a new 2 second season, when what we really want is the same 1st season wrapped as new.. We should embrace the second season by its own, and stop comparing. Because this is the new West. This TV show is,like Woody said,like you're watching a Movie but it's not,it+s a TV Show. After the first episode I was already hooked up :) The argumetns and lines between Rust and Marty during they drive a car are just,amazing!Funny,interesting,with a sense of black humor and Ironie. But to make it short...This TV show is after Dexter,the most genius interesting,exiting,which makes you at the end of the 1 season crying why the hell are are two True Detectives ?!? I think that EVERYBODY thinks the same,and feels the same as I do.Let's get real...the show without Woody and Matthew is not anymore what it was,it's a completely disappointment!That's how I felt when I was watching the first episode of season 2...and I was so sad that I stoped watching it further because I was shocked.It's a completely different and worst feeling and dynamic without Woody and Matthews. The show died when the season one finished. I was desperately waiting for season 2 however it was a big disappointment to me . The show is not bad , the performance of the actors are fine but it has nothing to do with season 1. There are no surprises , no deep messages, no mind blowing details but lots of Hollywood clichés. There are too many coincidences which are not possible in real life . This is not real life OK , but True Detective should be something more than a CSI. I was expecting something more intelligent, more taboo destructive , more fascinating. I liked to watch the show , it's not boring but I hope they will do better for season 3. Much better than the first series which was also very good. This one had better characters and a more thrilling storyline. The first one over did the monologues and long drawn out drooly speeches. This one has none of that and moves with a fantastic pace. Gripping, thrilling and captivating. Thsi one does not have as much of an eerie feel but it still retains some of the dark, mysterious mood that made the first one so watchable. None of the characters were annoying but highly compelling and many very likable. I was sad when it ended. Wish it could have been longer. I will now consider myself a Vince V and a Collin F fan. Before starting the second season of this show I was extremely excited for it to begin but as I watched the first two episodes I thought this second season was going to be a huge disappointment. Glad that I stuck it out for another two episodes, now being attached after the last two episodes I can honestly say I am in DEEP on this show. Is it going to be better than The first season? That will be an extremely steep hill to climb but writer Nic Pizzolatto is making a strong case. I honestly think the first season is untouchable. All bias aside I am a huge fan of Matthew McConaughey and it only makes since to put beside him another legendary actor Woody Harrelson. Those two together are incredibly entertaining and extremely intelligent. All that said, this new season, only 4 episodes is coming along very well. I am not ready to decide which of the two seasons I enjoy more. This could be an excellent show. But when HBO signs on for a show, it seems the station's criteria for success requires gratuitous nudity and sex when none is required for the plot. Additionally, if you enjoy seeing a show which depicts a nude woman, slaughtered and hung up crucifixion style, then perhaps you've got a stronger stomach and creepier sense of entertainment than I. On the former note, I don't care for programs that depict women in one role, sexual accessory to the story. On the later, anytime Hollywood successfully produces and earns accolades for shows where women are stripped nude, sexual assaulted, mercilessly slaughtered, and God knows what else, I think we, as a society, might want to reassess what we consider entertainment. It's a shame. The dialog is quite well written. If the writers could have toned down the implied horrific violence towards women and found a more "palatable" crime to base the show around perhaps it would have hooked me. I'm not easily scared away by shocking, gritty, and violent shows. I loved Breaking Bad, Walking Dead, Homeland, etc....but with this one, I didn't get past the second episode. Pffft. The first season was excellent. The second season is a letdown. The third season is fantastic again. She picks up on the dark picture of the first season and draws a complex murder story with intense characters. Still not as outstanding as season one. Amazing performances, cinematography, and storytelling. Season 1 is a masterpiece. Matthew Mcconaughey owns his role. Season one and three were similar in that there is lots of atmosphere, great photography and story build up but it ultimately came to a weak ending. Season 1 is pretty twisted in parts but is too long.
Season 2 again has lots of build up but amounts to not very much.
Season 3 cold have been great but the 2 main issues are a weak ending and mumbling, incoherent dialogue. There were many scenes when we couldn't understand a word that was said.
To summarise, these series are well filmed, with half decent stories but the pace needs to be quicker and they need to end better. This show hasn't been given a fair shake. It's definitely a top tier program Season 3 is very good, excellent in fact. Great acting. Story that keeps you interested and very well filmed and put together. Will watch season 4 without any doubt. That's all you need to know. It's filled with Philosophy, most of which contains pessimistic but thought provoking. One of my best TV shows. Too damn slow. I give the first season an 8, the second gets a 4 and the third walks with a 6 that really wanted to be more. Rachel McAdams is otherwise a decent actress but what happened here? The whole season she walked around with a frown like Rhonda Roussey. She literally looked like she had to poop. I'm baffled by her lack of acting. What happened? I cannot understand how anyone could rate this show lower than a 10. That being said, the anticipation of this show was worth it and beat all of my expectations and then some. Cast of actors are excellent and played so well it is as if they are the characters and no longer actors. A must see. Best show ever! Is was really good I actually finished the first seasonin1 day. Matthew and Woody was amazing in the show, wish they had them on the other seasons The best tv serie i have ever seen.
No words can describe the depth, the acting. Season 1 was, as many other already have stated, a masterpiece with all the important components such as smart mouthed/witty characters, the ability to glue you to the screen because of intense, creepy or dramatic scenes, and of course an interesting storyline. I loved season 1, the cast and scenery was spot on.
When season 2 was about to air I got excited. The intro is the only thing about season 2 that is not all bad, although I believe it is too long. I had high hopes about season 2, but already a few minuites into the first episode I started feeling restless, I lost track because I could easily get distracted and I had to go back multiple times. Since I had loved the first season I believed that I had to give the second season a fair shot. I tried my best, having watched not all but a few episodes until I couldn't stand it anymore. 
The casting was not bad, I appreciate the main characters, although I con't think they were a perfect fit for this story or for each other. They weren't clicking with each other. Maybe in some other series/movie they could blossom or really fit together, making the production a hit, but not this one. In addition to that I also believe that the storyline was sort of hastily scribbled up, not really worked on. It felt kind of like they made something just to make something, to not stand there empty handed. As a crime story, this "True Detective" series was only average. The pacing was laboriously slow for the first three episodes. And the narrative design was clumsy with an over-reliance on flashbacks and recurring interviews.<br/><br/>For an intricately plotted, eight-program series, the filmmakers were sloppy on details. For example, it was not clear how both detectives could retire from the police force and afford to rent a large office space in a strip mall to continue as private investigators working pro-bono on the Dora Lange murder case. For Marty Hart, how was he able to continue supporting his estranged wife and two daughters who lived in a beautiful home with their only income her salary as a nurse? <br/><br/>Indeed, the women's roles in this film were all under-developed and bore little resemblance to women in the twenty-first century. It was difficult to imagine that Marty's wife, Maggie, would return to him after his serial adultery. It was an even greater stretch to believe that the two younger women, Lisa and Beth, would give the time of day to an older, married, seedy detective. <br/><br/>Lisa worked as a court reporter and should know something about the law. Why wouldn't she report Marty for breaking and entering her apartment and assaulting her boyfriend? Instead, she plays the role of scorned woman and "reports" him only to Maggie. It was almost as if the women's characters were conceived in a detective film of the 1940s or '50s.<br/><br/>Another shortcoming was the standard suspense film technique of making the police appear incompetent. In a crime story, the expectation should be some degree of realism. But in "True Detective," it seemed as though Marty and Rust were the only members of the police squad assigned to investigate a string of murders. As for their fellow officer Steve Geracy, it was incredulous that he could have been both incompetent and unprofessional in taking a false deposition in the Marie Fontenot killing. That detail seemed like another plot device in the film, not the action that would derive from a veteran cop.<br/><br/>The best part of the film was development of the two detectives and the good performances, especially Woody Harrelson as Marty Hart. The banter between the two detectives was crisp, and the differentiation of their characters made them a compelling pair. It is unfortunate that the film was not tidier or not include a more creative approach to the two rogue detectives.<br/><br/>Regarding Season Two, the same problems from the same screenwriter abounded in spades: good characters, but weak narrative design. This review will be focusing on the first season.<br/><br/>This is an anthology series, meaning that each season has its own and unique story, setting, actors, characters etc.<br/><br/>With that out of the way, let's go! True Detective season one is my favourite TV show ever.<br/><br/>It tells a story revolving around a peculiar crime investigation and the two central characters in charge of the case: Rust Cohle and Martin Hart. Ultimately, though I found the investigation captivating, the character development of Rust and Martin is what truly drives the story in my eyes. <br/><br/>The investigation itself touches on something fairly rare in films and goes even deeper into something that most people believe to be fantasy of extremely isolated cases of completely insane people, which couldn't be further from the horrible truth. Fortunately, the shows manage to convey the level of atrocity that mankind is capable of without brutally throwing it in your face. It's much more subtle than that and it gets the job done. It's still dealing with a dark side of human psyche and thus, the show is pretty dark and brooding.<br/><br/>Most people are in awe of Rust Cohle's character and Matthew McConaughey's acting which I also found outstanding. However, I want to say that though Rust Cohle stands out more as a very peculiar individual full of unconventional ideas, philosophies and speeches, the writing and acting of Martin Hart is actually on par with him. He stands out less because Martin is more or less your typical cop, does his job, doesn't think to hard, comes home to his wife... But underneath every "regular guy" lies a story and a potential for good development which is fully exploited here. Everything that this guy goes through might seem a bit stereotyped at first but it's actually handled in a very coherent and meaningful way that gives much much depth to a seemingly basic character.<br/><br/>The relationship between the two of them, how it evolves around the case and what it becomes in the end was masterful to me.<br/><br/>The plot is not too complex but not too simple either. On the other hand, the way the story unfolds felt captivating to me, highly tense at times and the show consistently hit me with stunning cinematography and breath taking scenes.<br/><br/>At its core, this show is a true story about two broken men, why there are that way and how throughout this investigation, their relationship, they might be able to find something they that they need. All of that with a brilliant plot, top notch acting, character development, cinematography, writing, dialogues, you name it... <br/><br/>Final verdict: 10/10. This rating isn't an attempt to evaluate the actual objective value of the show but merely reflects my appreciation of it. Moreover, I'm not trying to say that True Detective is absolutely flawless, it does get the highest ranking because it is my favourite TV show ever so far.<br/><br/>Obviously after such a strong start, a lot of people had extremely high expectations for season two, but since it's an anthology series, you pretty much have to start from scratch and anything can happen.<br/><br/>I won't get into details but though I didn't enjoy the second season as much as I did the first, I honestly think that it's a remarkably solid crime fiction with, there again, great performances and a LOT of good things in it, I give it a 8,5/10. I would add that if you've never seen True Dective, I'd definitely recommend watching the second season first. As I said, it's an anthology so you can watch any season in any order you like but considering that the vast majority of people liked season one better than season two by a huge margin, you'd avoid the risk of being disappointed by the next season. True Detective is some truly fantastic television; its two leading actors are film-actors who fit right at home on this television series: Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson deliver one of the sharpest duos to ever grave TV. They're nothing like Sherlock or Watson; these two police officers, investigating a satanic-cult murdering young women around the Louisiana state, have nothing in common with each other. Detectives Cohle (McConaughey) and Hart (Harrelson) are living on totally opposite ends of the emotional spectrum; one (Cohle) is an existentialist struggling to cope with the loss of his daughter, while the other (Hart) is a more down-to-earth but not completely honest family man.<br/><br/>I think McConaughey is easily the standout actor of the show; his character 'Rust' Cohle is such a deep but complicated and traumatized man that he truly is comparable to classic detectives like Sherlock Holmes or Hercule Poirot. True Detective could arguably be presented as a showcase of McConaughey's acting skills beyond the medium of cinema. And he's got enormous talent with any project given his way.<br/><br/>Another golden-age television show in the bag. Matthew McConaughey as Detective Rust Cohle and Woody Harrelson as Detective Marty Hart set a new standard in crime drama's in season 1 of HBO's True Detective. The writing is excellent and the story is constantly building up through the last 20 minutes of the finale. They do a great job of pitting two people together as partners that are totally opposite yet bring out the best in the story and in the end each other as they hold each other to solving a decades long serial killing spree by being "the bad guys who keep the bad guys that prey on others in check" (paraphrase). Cohle's character is great as a near genius with some strange theology who has an extremely dark outlook on life. Marty (Woody) is a good cop who recognizes Cohle is a great one and though he drives him crazy goes along for the ride as they go on a roller coaster ride in solving a murder that 17 years later turns out to be a serial killer that they just can't let go because they only caught part of what turned out to be several psycho's killing kids and people in a horrific manner in the backwaters of the Louisiana Bayou. The best is even though they nearly destroy each others lives in the process, in the end they wind up the only two guys who get each other enough to tolerate one another in their solving and near death in capturing the last of the psycho crew killing these people. I simply loved it and am hoping season 2 can come close. Season 1 of True Detective is some of the best TV I have ever seen. It is stellar, particularly in our two main characters' chemistry. But first, let's talk about the technical side. The director absolutely excels at atmosphere, excellently contrasting the clean and professional workplaces and the gritty, underground areas of Louisiana. Although this is great, where the show shines is the two main characters' chemistries, some of the best I've ever seen. The two characters are almost polar opposites, with Marty Hart having the normal outlook on life, but Rustin Cohle having the philosophical and pessimistic viewpoint. Since Rust has a lot of interesting aspects to his character because of his philosophies, Marty has his own struggles, crafting a unique character on his own. However, these well-written characters reach their peaks when the "regular guy" and the "sociopathic weirdo" collide, as they do not get along, sometimes straight-out hating each other, but what forms their compatibility is their dedication to their jobs. This is the genius character writing of True Detective. This is one fantastic show... it's plot and how it unfolds, the characters and how they develop, the production and soundtrack are outstanding... but this only goes for season 1. Season 2 is absolute garbage with very special thanks to Vince Vaughn (and a poor plot and character base).<br/><br/>I gave it a chance, because... why not? There's no way it could be that bad, is there? <br/><br/>Yes, there really is... Vaughn is so frustratingly unsuited to the show and the character he clearly tries desperately to portray that I just couldn't get beyond episode 4.<br/><br/>Wish it never happened, and hope for a new season with better direction. Accidentally stumbled upon true detective when both season 1 and 2 had finished screening. After watching season-1 i have to say that i have never been glued so much by someone's acting, script, plot. Every single person has played an excellent part, i have always been a fan of Matthew Mcconaughey, but in true detective his acting is unparalleled, outstanding...so is his more stable partner. I have watched the entire season-1 more than 4 times now, the dark script is fascinating, on how Crash handles and looks down at religions and religious dogmas. This is the best undoubtedly.<br/><br/>Season-2 is just plain boring, for me personally if season-2 came out first, i would have missed Matthew Mcconaughey. It starts turning slowly, building mass around these characters. Then building more and more momentum around the story. Driving you as a helpless watcher towards the super deep darkness at the end.<br/><br/>True Detective season 1 is blood chilling and ultra captivating. <br/><br/>I am watching last episode while writing this, just to give my self a pause from the horrors.<br/><br/>Story is great and not at all obvious. Characters aren't black and white, but a relatable humans with faults like us. The way this is shoot and recorded is top notch also. Have not found any faults.<br/><br/>One of the very best television ever. A series that excels at storytelling and brilliant acting. I was never really a fan of Matthew McConaughey, but I have to say that the man more then delivers here. He and Woody Harrelson are superb as the a-typical detective duo. The dialogue is just gold, the lines McConaughey has are just awesome. Here's one about religion that hits the nail right on the head: "If the only thing keeping a person decent is the expectation of divine reward then, brother, that person is a piece of s***. And I'd like to get as many of them out in the open as possible. You gotta get together and tell yourself stories that violate every law of the universe just to get through the goddamn day? What's that say about your reality?". The season feels like one 8 hour long film with amazing character development and excellent production values. In of the later episodes there is an brilliant 6 minute shot in a police war-zone. That's things you only see in expensive movies. This is one of the best detective series you can watch and I don't even like investigative television so that should tell you all you need to know. If you haven't seen it definitely give it a go, it's a must see! This was a very good TV series because it kept you on your edge of your seat which is really cool in my opinion. The actors that were chosen for the movie were great for the show because they really got into their character and gave the feeling of mystery and finding the clues for what is going to happen next. The setting of it was done really well because it looked very mysterious which was pretty much how the whole series was. Whenever he would go on his adventure to check on the mystery it would be very interesting because the viewers didn't know what was gonna happen, anything could have happened it was like an open book. The best episode of the series was the last episode because it was so action packed. Especially when they were going through the tunnels that were made was very creepy. The best part of the last episode was when they were fighting with the other guy because it made it seem like the other guy was going to win but instead he ended of getting stabbed and beat up really bad by the other guy. That is what most movies and TV series do. Let me start by saying I'll watch anything with McConaughey in the cast. The evolution of his career has been fascinating. Woody Harrelson never appealed (as an actor) for me previously. But both of these actors were superb. The two characters played off of each other masterfully creating total suspension of disbelief.<br/><br/>This is a very dark, character-driven story. I wouldn't advise you watch if you're solely into action films; you would most likely be bored. The plot isn't a new one but the script, direction and delivery are absolutely award-worthy. I watched all the episodes in one sitting. You know when something is so horrific you want to look away but can't stop yourself? This will grab you from the music and opening scenes and leave you awed by the script and cast in the last seconds of the final episode. Well you have to see it to believe it. Its top notch, in terms of The acting, The on screen chemistry between our two detectives. Its simply outstanding, the way this character portray in the story and the way its played on screen. Its look so real that even a moment, not passed, that you feel the pinch and you say yourself, "Gosh! that's for real, its happening in real and somehow you their and witness that happening.<br/><br/>I am not well equipped, with tons of wonderful or eloquent vocabulary to describe the experience, I had while watching this particular series, but I do ask to each and every single user, who read my short review, just go watch and you gonna believe me, its simply 'Spellbound' experience. Seldomly you get with now-a-days TV series.<br/><br/>Eagerly waiting for Season two and hope writers/creative team keep up the good work. Very rarely does a show captivate you right from the beginning, take you higher and higher and when it eventually ends, as you know and dread its reaching that stage all too soon, you are still on a high. Then you start watching it a second time, just so you catch those parts that you missed the first time. Breaking bad was one such show, True Detective is as good or better. Matthew McConaughey delivers a powerhouse performance as Detective Rust Cohle. Now I am one of those people who watched McC in rom-com and adventure/comedy movies only earlier and thought it was impossible for him to deliver the performance he did in Dallas Buyers Club. I had recently watched that movie and was blown away by his acting. He brings that same intensity in this role and man, is he good!! Woody Harrelson gives McC awesome support both in character as his partner Detective Hart and as the co-actor. He is the anchor to McC's supposed freewheeling ideas and is his greatest supporter and as they say in the show his only pal. His portrayal of a man torn between family values and 'taking his release wherever he could find it' and his acting overall is brilliant. It is always delightful watching the lovely Michelle Monaghan and she does a good job in this show as Mrs Hart. The storyline, the way it slowly unravels, the edginess to it and the brilliant acting by the lead and supporting actors make it one of the best shows out there. When I reached the eventual end, I was left asking for more, much more. I read there is a second season in development now. I don't see how a new season can follow this brilliant first one but here's hoping it turns out as good as the first season. I just stumbled on this one, seeing the first episode without having seen any trailers or reviews. The first episode left me a bit confused, although I like to be confused, never going for "lighter" more "straightforward" cop series. This was because of the narrative style, with some jumping back and forth between 1995 and 2010, the characters gotten older was for some unknown reason called in long after they had quit the force, being interviewed, or maybe more interrogated, about an investigation about some form of ritualistic killings in the swamplands of Louisiana. It's very slow paced, especially in the beginning, but after the two first episodes things start to take completely new and quite absurd, mystical turns, with hints of supernatural involvement, but also taking off into more action packed sequences, though it is by no means an action series! It delves into weird, quirky, despicable people each with very different agendas, it seems, involving everything from drug-fueled satanists to biker gangs, religious charlatans and everything in between.<br/><br/>It's a must see for the performances and dynamics between Harrelson and McConnaughey alone, and add to that a plethora of superb supporting roles. Give it some time, pay attention, and you will have a blast watching this! "Man - the most cruelest animal ..." (Friedrich Nietzsche) <br/><br/>"True detective" - a "masterpiece" not afraid of the word. Exactly. Could not enjoy its beauty even after a second review. My emotions are hard to describe but I'll try.<br/><br/>Very intriguing crime story of two cops buddy Rast Cole and Martin Hart, who are investigating the complex and mysterious ritual murder, drive through abandoned places south America, trying to find at least one knot to untangle it. Of course, on their way to meet a lot of questions and challenges that are not so easy to overcome. This is sort of a "hail-fellow film" most of the time we are dealing with two colleagues, and the relationships between them, dish out in very specific sets and using it is very unsustainable scenario.<br/><br/>Events unfold, for the most part, in the present and past tense, without a future. The plot develops slowly, slowly implanted in the most secluded places of the human brain and consciousness, even in the psyche. Yes, I was just so in me that it was turned upside down and I could not tear myself away from that intense mystical palpable atmosphere of the picture.<br/><br/>Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson - perfect duo. Really liked the acting, these highly intelligent dialogs between them, as well as monologues of each of them, the emotions at a high level. I should also mention the fundamental work of the director Cary Fukunaga, screenwriter - Nic Pizzolatto (which is not so well known as it seemed) and, of course, the composer - T Bone Burnett. Thank them for their talent and hard work.<br/><br/>It is important to notice that the picture is not for every viewer. The series is full of subtleties of religion, Southern Gothic, evangelicalism and fundamentalism, mysticism, questions of Nazism, satanism and Pythagoreans, Sikhism, sacrifices and rituals worse, lots of symbolism. As well there are many allusions and even staging, in comparison with other creations of cinema. That mass of art, genre subtleties, psychology and philosophy, makes the show is not just aware of it. As for me the film is very impressive, even able to learn - what lay in my head some unknown truths.<br/><br/>This creation - as one of the wonders how difficult architectural building, like the Sagrada Familia, which finish and improved for a long time.<br/><br/>In anticipation of the second season of the anthology.<br/><br/>My highest score! 10 of 10! A very interesting mini-series taking place in New Orleans and Louisiana.<br/><br/>A recent and very disturbing crime, hardly described actually, sends two cops in today's world back into the past and a similar crime that is described with more detail, though not too much, and especially the two ex-cops who dealt with the crime at the time in 1995 or so. The crime got a solution. In fact a solution was found and the spectacular crime was not repeated but the deeper crime which was the abduction and disappearance of children was never examined in depth because of a blocking element in the family circle of the governor and one of his relative, nephew or whatever, who was a preacher and who had a whole network of religious institutions dealing with the education of children, and yet any piece of inquiry was leading that way, to these institutions, particularly one that was closed after some kind of hushed up scandal.<br/><br/>The two cops who dealt with that older case are both out of the police force and they become, particularly one, suspects or persons of interest for the two modern time cops.<br/><br/>The investigation of the two modernistic cops will lead nowhere. They actually will come across one of the people in the case but they will not know the difference between right and left (or wrong as for that) nor back and front.<br/><br/>The two ex-cop turned private investigators will come to a real solution this time, some kind of a closure but the solution will not be satisfactory because the political and religious establishment in New Orleans will accept you arresting in a way or another one or two of the members of the grass and roots monstrous army that practices children abduction as a sport and entertainment for further games and distractions but not higher than that.<br/><br/>The happy abducted children end up soliciting in New Orleans. The unhappy ones end up being live toys for some adults whose minds are so perverted that the captive will end up in small pieces but death will only ensue long, long, long after the beginning of the live slicing up and live cutting off and live extracting of this or that organ.<br/><br/>The mini-series remains very prudent as for graphic exposure of this violence and torture. The main interest is the effect of it onto the two cops who originally started investigating the case and will bring it so some kind of a satisfactory though partial solution. As one of the two will say: "You can never get them all." He should have added "You can never get the big fish in such cases." And you must get yourself satisfied by the fact the big fish authorizes you to take the minnows, their minnows. It is true one minnow down, ten minnows up. Volunteering in this field of human monstrosity is the most common element you can imagine.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU<br/><br/>SECOND SEASON<br/><br/>If you like messy situations and systematic corrupt police forces and political institutions, this is your series. No matter who you are, if you are on the other side of the road across from some corrupted people, you will die. If you are not corrupted and thus ready to die any time the corruptor will deem it necessary to kill you, then you will die. There is no choice in this world apart from being a corruptor at the top or being a perambulating still not dead character that will sooner than later end up six feet under.<br/><br/>Of course, you can kneel in the middle of a road and pray for a truck to run over you.<br/><br/>Of course, you can, every morning, take some non-lethal dose of cyanide and after a short while, it will accumulate till it kills you.<br/><br/>Of course, you can start shooting with a gun in a street, up in the air if you do not want to kill or wound anyone, but you will end up dead with many bullets from duly-weaponed NRA members or some duly-trained killing cops.<br/><br/>But apart from that, all the rest is circumstantial. I would just advise you to choose a way to die duly avenged before dying. Kill a few and wound the others and they will kill you on the spot.<br/><br/>Entertaining because of that totally rotten vision of a rotten society that does not even try to plead non-guilty. The title is borrowed from a magazine, "True Detective" (originally "True Detective Mysteries"), a pulp magazine that enjoyed fake detective stories and giving details on all sorts of cases that existed or not, but all the details were more or less fantasized, fanciful and maybe even plainly invented.<br/><br/>Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU One day I was searching for new series on IMDb and when I saw True Detective's rating I just had to start watching it despite the fact that Woody Harrelson was in it (Don't know why I don't like that guy at all) and that I'm really not into these kind of crime/murderer hunt series.<br/><br/>At first the show was a bit slow for my taste and the 60 minute episodes made me kind of tired. Plus I really didn't like the main characters (Cohle and Hart). Cohle was so damn strange all the time and spoke so slowly and Hart was always chewing tobacco (I guess) because his face was so odd-looking and he spoke like he couldn't use his face muscles correctly.<br/><br/>Longer I kept watching the more I started to get into the show. After three or four episodes there was more action but still not a lot and I even started to like the characters in some way. The characters started to evolve and I could understand them way better than at the beginning. The balance between the mad, odd, inhumanlike Cohle and down-to-earth Hart is a nice touch and in some way I preferred Cohle so much more than Hart.<br/><br/>The show has a very dark atmosphere all the time with a lot drama, blood, sex, fighting, drugs, drinking and so on so it's a not a show for children. I usually can't enjoy these kind of shows because they make me feel distressed and I just don't understand the appeal but still I continued watching for some reason.<br/><br/>It's not your basic cop or murder investigation show, it has a different approach to it anyways with the two time lines. And I guess the murder investigation part isn't even the main thing, the main point of the show in my opinion is the two main characters and their lives which are affected by the investigation.<br/><br/>How about the casting and the acting? I think the actors and the actresses are very well chosen. They really fit to the roles and the acting is just brilliant. Especially the part of detective Cohle played by Matthew McConaughey. I mean WOW, spot-on choice. I really won't comment on Woody Harrelson for the part of detective Hart because as I stated before, I just don't like the guy, I think it's something to do with his face and the way he speaks. But yeah, the acting and the casting is really the best part of the show.<br/><br/>In essence the show is good, not great in my opinion but I can understand why people love it so much. It's filled with drama,twists, fighting, drugs, sex and if you are into those I highly recommend the show. If you are thinking about watching the show, you really have to watch every episode and not an episode here and there.<br/><br/>Verdict: 7/10, but still highly recommend the show if you are fan of crime, drama, mystery and murder investigation shows. I started watching this in January, and had to give up because the 2 main characters made my skin crawl. Then thought I'd give it another chance. Just finished and all I can say is - Wow!!! I have seen a lot, read a lot and was so enthralled by this as I haven't been for a long time. I loved Fargo but that was a different kettle of fish and in it's own way brilliant. I was taken aback by the fantastic acting, Matthew McConaughey, believed every dark side he had, Woody Harrleson, believed every doubt, self-hate, moment. Nic Pizzolatto's writing must be praised to the highest degree because it was his script that gave them the chance to shine. Each director gave their episodes their touch but kept the main theme intact making everything smooth. I gave this a 9, I don't give 10s, but I would like to give a 9.9 as after over 50 years of TV this nearly made me change my mind. I came to "true detective" because of a friend of mine who was so enthusiastic about "this incredible series" that I finally felt curious and decided to follow his advice. I usually don't look at series and I'm not a big fan of crime and cops movies either but this time I can say I'm very impressed. I would say this series is not an usual cop drama like you can be used to see. It really has something more special. Music is great and brings a very special atmosphere. Cast is brilliant (The voices of the two detectives are fascinating for a non-native American speaker! What an accent!). Dialogues are maybe the thing I like the most in it. These are very well written, percussive and, mainly, often very funny. Four in and if there's one point it's still hazy. This is, of course, by design. True Detective gives it self up small pieces at a time. Everything is cloaked in darkness and despair. One might say that's the point: Darkness is a contagious disease pervasive on either side of supposed law and order. The coming together of the two detectives is due to a particularly bizarre ritualistic murder of a woman which they are assigned to investigate.<br/><br/>What is certain: True Detective revolves around the pairing of two quite different, but mutually outrageous, Louisiana lawmen. Each of their life's are in a state of decay. The Woody character not as much, but soon his family life is shattered and he is descending into his partner, McConnahey's, strange state of disorder. Their following the crime propels this. The two are slowly getting in too deep as they constantly breach protocol and act quite criminally, at times, themselves. Their case has it's strange hold on them to which they, many times, simply seem enslaved to. How far will they go to solve the case? As of the fourth episode the bottom hasn't been reached and things are getting progressively out there.<br/><br/>The show seeks to be a sort of mysterious crime drama with nods to intellectualism. Action isn't required in this mind-game thus it's used sparingly. The show is polarizing which seems to be intentional. It doesn't apologize for either the slow pace or the constant use of a present day interview device, which though not clear as to why, presents each detective being separately interviewed about the, now apparently, 14-year old case. The Woody character may still be a cop, however it's clear the McConnahey character isn't and has descended much deeper into his own separation from both his former job and society as a whole. The sum of the parts is strangely addictive as the audience to whom this interests will not miss an episode. Sometimes the mixture of thinking man and drug-addled misfit wears thin for the McConnahey role, but the story simply wouldn't work without it as it is central. There has been some criticism here of McConnahey's acting. The fact that a contingent feel that way strangely spells he is successful to a large degree though. This stuff is meant to be disturbing and most definitely is. The audience it seeks, and reaches, can't turn away. I'd say True Detective accomplishes what it attempts in the low-key brilliance to which it aspires. This is chance taking in the creation and realization of a TV series, even in it's familiarity of despicable crime married to dirty cops it blazes territory few TV series dare to touch. Strangely addictive. The show is incredible. All 3 seasons have been great. Writing, direction, acting. My question is, What is it about everyone smoking cigarettes all the time?? It's distracting. Once you notice it you can't stop noticing. Almost every scene has someone smoking. I know for some directors that it's a tool for making the overall series more real more realistic. Why?? True detective is a novel that is not the most read one like your grishams or dan browns. It is one of those novels that you only hear when its acclaimed author recieves a nobel prize. What it is not is a whodunnit story which will give all the answers in the end. It is a puzzle that gives you more questions while you fathom the harsh realities of our society without condemning it outright by simply revealing the shroud. It is a must watch show. All seasons! First time I had seen Mahershala Ali in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and his acting stuck in my memory. After there was an unexpected Remy Danton from House of Cards now is multifaceted detective Wayne Hays. In my opinion, he is a stunning actor I watch this series because of he there is. It's told in flashback. Not a good start. But - oh yes - it's so we see the viewpoints of the two main characters. But the way it plays out, just telling the goddamn story without the flashbacks would give you exactly the same info.<br/><br/>Harrelson and McConaughey are two of my absolute favourite actors. You can see why they would be attracted by the roles and you can say nothing but that they are 110% brilliant! But the script... They totally fail to save a pretentious, self-indulgent, inconsequential script.<br/><br/>It's trying to do a variation on Breakign Bad. I know I'm in the minority with this but if drama is life with the dull bits cut out, Breaking Bad was the absolute antithesis. You know; the long slow shots, the meaningless conversations, all the inconsequentialities - basically, the lack of plot development until the last five minutes.<br/><br/>That's True Detective.<br/><br/>Slow.<br/><br/>The nuances and irrelevancies of life.<br/><br/>They say each scene in a good script should move the plot forward and/or reveal character. Well, there's certainly a lot of character being revealed but at the end of the day - or series - it doesn't really matter and who cares? Is it deep? It's a pretentious script writer's stab it. Meaningful? Nope. Interesting? Obviously to some. Story? Yes, it has a beginning, middle and end but the distance between those points is laborious in the extreme. Worthwhile? As fart. Really, if you want to waste your time, go watch paint dry.<br/><br/>But, heck - they've made a second series so I must be wrong! On the positive side you can sleep through it, wake up for the last few minutes and not miss anything. And the theme music is great!<br/><br/>Did I watch them all? Heck, no! I watched 1, 2 and 3. Rigor mortis was setting in so I skipped to 8. Did I miss much? Well, I picked up the thread pretty easily so that's a Big No. Did it matter? I don't think so and I care less. At least in 8 the plot was moving and not dragging weed.<br/><br/>Why take eight hours to tell a 20-minute story? Because you can, I guess.<br/><br/>But that's just my opinion.<br/><br/>Dashiell Hammett, Ray Chandler or Mickey Spillane would have writ it proper! Seriously,I'm giving this rating just for the first season alone..Everything was perfect in it...McConaughey,Harrelson..The story,The camera work(Who can forget that epic tracking shot in Episode 4?),The setting,The direction...Everything clicked perfectly(save for the disappointing ending)...<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and watch the First season alone....Don't watch the second season..I watched the first episode and couldn't sit through it..It was that boring..The performances were functional at best..And the atmosphere that was a high point of Season 1 was notably absent here...It felt like another standard crime drama..<br/><br/>That should sum it up for you.. Matthew McConaughey is on fire: 'Killer Joe', 'The Lincoln Lawyer', 'Mud', 'The Dallas Buyers Club', 'The Wolf of Wall Street' and 'Interstellar' are all in a file now labelled "The McConaissence". Matthew wants to leave his shirt on and be taken seriously again. With an Oscar to his name, I doubt we are to see him regress to the rom-com King who appeared in such successes as 'The Wedding Planner', 'Ghosts Of Girlfiends Past' and the aptly titled 'Failure To Launch'. To join said films will be series one of 'True Detective', in which he plays Rustin Chole opposite Woody Harrelson's Marty Hart. They are ex-Louisiana law enforcement, both separately recounting their seventeen year old investigation of the murder of a young girl and their subsequent apprehension of the perpetrator. Why are they doing this? Because it has happened again.<br/><br/>The sense of familiarity as one watches the show is no surprise; there are plenty of tropes being revisited. Numerous elements from 'Twin Peaks', 'Se7en', 'The X-Files', 'Millenium' and most bleak British TV drama can be found somewhere in here; and the "chalk and cheese" partnership has surely existed since the dawn of the cop drama. None of this is criticism; the show manages to feel fresh in its approach, dealing as much with the development of the men and their lives as with the investigation itself, as well as how they affected one another in a professional and personal capacity. Whilst McConaughey takes the more "out there" role, frequently spouting downbeat philosophies on life, which sometimes threaten pomposity, Harrelson delivers with equal verve as the boring and very flawed family man. The two actors' chemistry is through the roof and, as with 'Breaking Bad, it is primarily this which keeps the compulsion to watch quite so high.<br/><br/>Praise must also go to the director of all eight episodes, Cary Fukunaga. He gives the whole series a specific and consistent vibe, often echoing David Fincher in its most miserable moments. His technique is smooth and solid, and a now-famous tracking shot in one of the show's few action set-pieces cannot go unnoticed due to its length and how obviously well-planned it is; Scorsese would be proud! He paces the story at a crawl, which matches the setting and lets us know we are not to race from point A to B, but rather to get comfortable with these characters. Original music is noteworthy for its tone-setting and Fukunaga holds together and makes constantly compelling what is, for the most part, a complex and languorous plot.<br/><br/>And so it is here I find the show's weaknesses; granted, they're not many, but they are significant, and they fall to writer Nic Pizzolatto. Firstly, there is a general reduction of females to plot devices, with the exception of Marty's wife Maggie, although even her the story frames in such a way, unrealistically I'd add, as to make her unnecessarily unlikeable. I have seen it written that this ties in with a theme of the show, but I'm not sure this holds up as a genuine intention. The fact the writer has his stomping ground in literature accounts for the show's apparent depth, richness of dialogue and character in the leads, but is more of a shock when I consider how uninteresting other characters actually are.<br/><br/>He also seems to dig himself a hole. The show is not so much one of two halves, but rather of one of three thirds: The first sets up all we need to know and makes for slow, dark viewing; the second propels us into another gear; action takes place, story turns are introduced, and a great deal of convolutions come into play, including a serious build up of mysterious happenings, mystical and literary references, and character traits are focused on as though promising exciting payoffs...We see the technique everywhere, it's the essence of tension, creating intrigue with a view to a majestic revelation, or a shock, or a twist...<br/><br/>None of which we really get in the last two episodes of 'True Detective'. In fact, I was quite surprised how unsurprised I was. We are given a convenient McGuffin, which leads to a tense but ultimately underwhelming showdown with someone from 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre', and a conclusion, which is unearned, in which we learn stars are pretty. You recall how well judged the finale of 'Breaking Bad' was? You remember how everything tied up? Yeh, that doesn't happen here; many a question is left open (I could list them but don't do spoilers), and the final notes just ring false for the characters and the show. That this comes after 6 hours of such earnest and genuinely compelling storytelling is frustrating. <br/><br/>There will be those who defend the finale as a philosophical piece, saying those who think this way just "didn't get it", but this doesn't wash for me; I LIKE that sort of thing, I LIKE ambiguity, but I also like dramatic gratification. Building up a theme, character and mystery to this level, with such shallow payoff is disappointing. There is a sense that the show should have been longer, perhaps, because the last hour feels fumbled and rushed, as though Pizzalatto never got the chance to knock down all the ducks he had set up. The gear shifts and we race off to the conclusion, leaving in the dust quite a lot of that which built the desire to get to the end in the first place. Such is the quality of the production elsewhere, I can only imagine how such a fudged ending came to pass. <br/><br/>All this said, one cannot take away from the performances or the direction, and I will not deny that it is generally exciting. I almost wish the same team were back with a better writer for season two, because it COULD be perfect! Season one is very good, just not the revelation some want to believe. OK after having watched the first 3 episodes so far i have to say this is one of the better series I've seen recently. It is very well made and has some fantastic shots in it. The story so far has been fairly slow moving, it's a very slow burn and to be honest after the first episode i wasn't all that bothered about watching the next one. I carried on though and I'm glad i did, the second episode got a lot more interesting, a lot was added to the main characters stories which was great. The overall tone of the show is very dark and a bit depressing, me and my girlfriend who was also watching got a bit bummed out by it. There are some small moments of comedy but they are few and far between.<br/><br/>The best thing about the series though is the acting, Woody Harrelson is his usual self but gives a solid performance as always. The star by far though is Matthew McConaughey, I've seen him in other films but never really paid any attention to him. I saw him in Wolf of Wall Street last week and enjoyed his performance but in this he is brilliant!. I'm sure he will be winning some sort of award for his performance.<br/><br/>To finish then i would say give this a go, it really isn't going to be for everyone due to the tone and slow burn of the story, it's not one for action fans either but the story is interesting if slow and the acting is top notch. Season 3 is very slow and boring but season 1 was the beast Pieces falling into place!! Hope McConaughey & Harrelson were OK with their faces used in the old newspaper as sickos!!! That was a surprise! Finely we recognize the Pizzaloto atmosphere, we hope the show will grape the first place on 2019 tv series ranking. Before you kill me, let me explain: this show is great, the acting is amazing and the fifth and sixth episodes are the best episodes on the show, but that's it. While I watched the show, I probably would have rated it as 9/10, even 9.3/10 and would have recommended it to anyone I know. but a week after, the show left me with a bad taste. The acting, as I said, was great, but all the fighting scenes looked unreliable, and there were some editing that looked weird (it's not a big problem so it does not affect the score). In the show, there are 2.5 characters that you will remember: The two detectives (the 2) and the killer (the 0.5). That's it. the other characters like Marty Hart's family are so unnecessary that I found myself wondering why they are even in the show. And NO, this show is not innovative in any way. A mysterious killer that abuse his victims and slay them in a dark pagan way? Saw it already in "Se7en", (especially the scene where the victim in "Se7en" strained to the bed like the killer's father in this show. Most of the interest vanish when the killer gets discovered. From a cool and mysterious description of "a green king in the forest", or "a hell on earth" you get a pedophile. Big whoop. This kind of plot of a killer pedophile have been portrayed to us million times, which only makes me wonder even more - why people praise this show like it invented the wheel in any kind of way? and let's not even talk about all the mambo jumbo that Rust Cohle (Matthew McConaughey) says throughout the entire show. I found myself just like Marty, want him to just "shut up". Or the hugely disappointing and weird ending scene (wich probably why I was left with bad taste). In conclusion, If you haven't watched a lot of movies/TV shows about solving dark murder cases, you're in for a treat, but if you did, you can skip the show because you won't get anything new from it. Controversial folks !! I didn't like season 1 at all,totally boring as hell, however i never rate either woody or matthew as actors at the best of times. Both so full of themselves and the reality of their performances never even remotely matches up. Both boring most of the time in my view. Season 2 however was just amazing. Colin and rachel and vince were all excellent as was taylor. The story re Ray and his child was heart wrenchingly tragic. Poor Kelly Reilly didn't have a good role but she did the best she could with it i guess. She is normally excellent in British drama. Colin Farrell though did a career best with this one. I think he is an actor of such great breadth and capacity and sublety, sometimes he has had a wee wobble but overall one of my favourite actors, and indeed Irish as I am! So well done Colin! Indeed also well done Rachel and Vince. Rachel and Vince both also career best in my view. And the ensemble cast overall.I dare anyone to try top their performances in this amazing drama. A dull and predictable watch akin to a soap opera such as Eastenders where mindless acts of violence and infidelity keep the viewer from bursting into a laughing fit at how poor the story is. All in all it is a slightly better than average show that if taken at face value is OK as it is your bog-standard cop-show. Unfortunately, Nick Pizolatto has ensured that it is the epitome of pretentiousness giving back-story to his characters that we have seen time and time again in countless cop shows. <br/><br/>Please don't watch if you are expecting it to be intelligent or insightful in any way, as you will merely have your intelligence insulted by Mr. Pizolatto. I dont know why this series got so high rating. It's very slow paced. The narrative is all jumbled up. They reveal the story slowly. Thats not bad but very boring. Particularly personal life I don't much about s01 & s02. But what I personally found was S03 was kinda boring. We had high hopes for this series based on its 9.0 rating. We were quickly disappointed. There must be a lot of paid reviewers here. This is one of the worse, slowest-moving detective series we have ever seen (we're up to about 80 now). It's filled with nonsensical dialogue. Maybe 10% is detective work and the rest is about the personal lives and pretentious philosophies of the two detectives. It is incredibly bad. We're skipping Seasons 2 & 3. Don't waste your time. I had my doubts about watching the third season. The first season totally underwhelmed me, while my film buff friends went absolutely nuts over it. I thought it was way too overdone. Like ruining a steak. Everything about it was over done. The characters, the crime, the direction. The acting. It was just trying way to hard.
So reluctantly I turned on the third season. I'm glad I did, because so far I've been captivated by the lead actors. Talk about Steven Dorf! My gawd I thought he overdosed on cocaine somewhere . Is he sober now? I guess ! He puts in a stellar performance here . He is really talented. Who knew!
The other outstanding show here is his partner; forgive me I do not know his name. The main actor playing a tormented detective with dementia who goes back in his memories to remember a case.
What a beautiful performance.
Just to watch these two makes the show worth it. But we have some other bonuses. A crisp plot and writing is great. The characters are well developed.
I am really into this actor. I hope to see him in more and Steven Dorf! Wow. I would love to see him in more now that he has matured into an actor that seems to have changed his priorities... they both love their craft here and it's wonderful to seeZ Re: Season 3
Besides needing to rewind and re-listen to about 30% of the dialogue (an d so glad I did), this show is extremely entertaining-a bonafide 9.9. Each episode evolves the story in a stunning and mind-bending way. Everything from the human aging process, relationships, literature, addiction, human sexuality, and of course 'crime and punishment' (on soooo many levels) is presented in thoughtful and artful ways. Every word and every scene is elemental to the greater story, so you won't get the full impact if you are distracted while watching. Pay attention, the principle characters deliver big-time, and the writers and director have produced an entertaining and useful work-of-art.<br/><br/>Mahershala Ali offers another great performance, which is beginning to spoil me because someday, when I see him in a bad role or performance, my image of him as a great American acting "god" is going to collapse and take some piece of me with it... But, there are multiple acting breakthroughs in this series for actors who are long-overdue for accolades. Stephen Dorff, "YAY"! Scoot McNairy, "Bravo"! Mamie Gummer "Woohoo"! Carmen Ejogo "Nails it"!!<br/><br/>This is a series that uses the mystery and complexities of crime to hook the viewer into the story, then rewards and honors the viewer by revealing the relatable developments that collide randomly and contribute to what we interpret as 'horror' or 'tragedy'. It reminds us that 'crime' is often the result of long-term suffering, or abuse, or neglect, or other neuroses that accummulate and explode/implode often taking many innocent people with it. I am gaining a greater understanding of just what it means to be a law enforcement officer and the many elements that must be balanced in order to establish fairness and safety in our communities and society...nothing is 'black or white' and we do ourselves a disservice when we reduce ourselves by viewing the world in such harsh contrast. There is 'grey' area everywhere but we need to use our grey matter and heart to see it. Series 1 was good, Series 2 lacked the mystery and puzzlement of Series 1, but Series 3 is back on track, slow but steady storytelling, complex characters that are often not what they seem, plus good use of time and detail. The cast in Series 3 immerse themselves in their characters, yes the sound/dictation is a bit deep and mumbled, but it seems to add to the atmosphere. First of all, let me establish that I struggle trying to get into shows that have a ton of hype surrounding them. Typically, these shows are either worth the added attention, or turn out to be a waste of time in my experience. Season 1 of True Detective had a bit of hype when I discovered it, but not enough to turn me away. Hands down, the cast of season 1 was perfect! Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson were so perfect in their performances that it honestly made me take a closer look at these actors and their body of work. McConaughey's character was mesmerizing! especially as the show progressed, moving back and forwards in time and illustrating both the dynamics of the character as well as McConaughey's ability to entertain. Season 1 will not disappoint. At first I was impressed. I thought it was going to be a great new series. I enjoyed the actors, Great, dark atmosphere. Interesting characters , seedy crime and this is one of my favorite genres.. I am not a film critic, and this show has a lot of film critic highs. Like subtle messages within the show. You know, symbolism and such. It seems like all the critics will praise any film or show, that does that. I think because they want to seem smart and they think that if they really really like somethjng that has a lot of these hidden messages in in it, that means that they figured them all out, and look at me I'm brilliant 2boot. Well, here is the thing. After all the subliminal messaging what have we got? I tell you what, it's a slow drag man. Sure it's stylish. Sure it's pretty to look at. But it's really lacking in the personality department. There is not a lot of action. There is not a lot of mystery. There could be. But instead of focusing on a crazy serial killer they focus on cops. The cops investigating the murder. They don't spend enough time on the crime, on the mystery, on the suspense. This is someone's ego. Again. They could've had such a awesome show. But instead some writer just jacked off on paper again. He wanted to impress us. Couple that with a direction that is trying to be hipster, you got a very boring vehicle here. So boring and repetitive that I actually had to turn it off and quit at like episode 7. Why? Because they just did the same thing, over and over again. No new tricks. I think they fell so in love with themselves the first episode, that they just stuck with the formula. So what happened is that basically. It's the same episode , over and over again, but it's not. Maybe one thing happens that is new each episode and the rest of it is just the actors grandstanding. For too long Monologues that need to end . After reading the rave reviews, I'm going to give it another shot. I will turn it on , one more time, although I'm not sure I can endure the pain of the first episodes again . I think I will start with. 4, again and see if it picks up or does anything different. It just got boring for me . Big time. But I also am in the minority . I mean . This show has a really high rating and maybe I'm wrong. Or maybe everyone who rated it did so after the first episode. Who knows? I just like my crime drama to be about crime and be suspenseful and I like to solve the mystery, you know? And in this show , they don't focus enough on the crime to attempt to solve it. The wait is endless and when something good or interesting happens, like a crime scene, they just ruin it with going back to the detectives . I know , I know , if I was an idiot, I would think that one of the cops did it . This is basically the story of two men. That's it. If you are into character study and stylish scenery and king hipster -you'll love it . But if you like your crime thrillers to be thrilling- skip it. This is very not thrilling. At all. Also sober . So that might have something to do with it. . I think I'm in the minority there. I imagine this would be very impressive to someone who smokes a lot of weed for instance. It could have been so good too. Man. Wasted , at least the first few episodes. "True Detective" is described by its author Nic Pizzolatto as an anthology show. meaning that each of the two seasons is a complete story in itself. Pizzolatto wrote all the sections. The series revolves around two criminals, Rust Cohle played by Matthew McConaughey and Marty Hart played by Woody Harrelson. They are both state police in Louisiana and we follow them during the investigation of a case that will span over 17 years. The two actors make testosterone-stained versions of their own characters. McConaughey is the slightly flabby and unstable. Harrelson is tough and biting. Their relationship goes up and down through the series but still remains the core that everything revolves around. The series skips between different time periods. The deep American South, with its swamps and deltas where pumps and factory chimneys rise on the horizon, where rotting old houses in the middle of nowhere carry dark secrets, where prostitution, violence and drugs boil beneath the godly surface is the third protagonist of "True Detective," firstly and foremost a mood piece. Only at a point does the slow tempo break with more action-driven sequences and these are masterfully performed by director Fukunaga. It is very much a men's world that is portrayed. Like so many other series, the story balances the narrow, delicate boundary between depicting a sexist world and being sexist. Take note that this is only a review of season 1, I've heard that this show should have stayed a miniseries even if there are good parts in Season 3. That's why I'm not giving this a rating (probably would be a 9 for S1)
Seriously what a season. Like most shows the reason this works is not because of the overarching mystery plot line, although that is very good, it's really because of the characters. Harrelson as Marty, Monaghan as Maggie and specifically McConaughey as Rust. All of them bring these characters to life but the latter really takes the cake
The story is paced excellently, where we see the case be concluded half way through and the rest takes place in the future trying to find the real cult leader, it's brilliant. So many great moments aside from that, like that ending scene with rust opening up, and the less I say about that one take the better
Recommend that you pick it up one day and watch the first 8 hour season, it's fantastic and something I won't forget.<br/><br/>
Oh and that intro, best of all time. Sorry GOT Leaving it simple and concise. True Detective is a unique series like no other. However, taking into account the function of the series of different stories per season, I'm qualifying based on the first season, which I consider one of the best tv works that have ever existed.<br/><br/>Incredibly deep, it is symbolic and full of fascinating details that quarrel with the psyche of our thinking; the kind of work that makes us think constantly with strong subliminal messages and moments of crucial transformation. An excellent series of detectives and crime, but I consider it even better an excellent series of development of characters and history. Absolutely brilliant, dark, depressing and at the same time, colorful and brutal.<br/><br/>The chemistry between the protagonists is incomparable; it is a relationship of hate that evolves with a formal, tangible and logical attitude that is built on the basis of the actions of the characters and their circumstances, not only is it an absolutely perfect script, but also performances from another world.<br/><br/>A fascinating ending that we do not usually expect from this type of series, but that manages to close with an excellent high note.<br/><br/>One of the best series in ever. Atleast you must watch for Matthew McConaughey's acting as a Rust Cohle. His words about life,philosophia and everything you can imagine with smoke just unbelievable amazing True Detective Season 1 tells one the oldest stories in human history - light versus dark. Alright most the time I review a TV show I will only do it after the show is concluded and I've seen it all. I feel that would be a disservice to this one though so only rated the first season as the seasons are unrelated. Season 2 has none of the same characters and is a convoluted mess. Season 1 though is a masterpiece. Best show I've ever watched. It had everything. Great acting. Great chemistry between Harrelson and McConaughey. Beautiful women. A great mystery and interesting detective work. A horrible crime that unites two people who really don't get along. I'm rambling but I have seen some of the best shows ratings wise and this is the best. I've seen Dexter, Breaking Bad, Band of Brothers, The Sopranos, Game of Thrones, etc. I'm missing a few but this is the best one I've seen yet and I watch way too much tv. Let's all collectively pretend that season 2 of True Detective NEVER happened. Swallowing my anger and disappointment about season 2, I don't have a single negative thing to say about True Detective season 1. It was perfect. The show takes place over 3 time period: 1995, 2002, and 2012. In 2012 Marty (Woody Harrelson) and Rust (Matthew McConaughey) are being interviewed by the police about a case that they "solved" back in 1995. The interviews frame the story in a really interesting and compelling way. You get to see where these men were and where they ended up simultaneously and the whole time you just wanna know how they got there. McConaughey's monologues are not only extremely entertaining but they're truly captivating. The chemistry between Harrelson and McConaughey is phenomenal. And to top it all of, the murder mystery at the center of this story is so strange and wrapped up in mystery and mythology that you'll be on the edge of your seat the entire time. True detective season 1 was television at it's finest and a perfect example of how television has become the new cinema. If you haven't watched True Detective yet, do it. But stop at the end of season 1. You will regret watching season 2 (which I would give a whopping 0 starts) A stirring, brooding script, with intriguing characters. Woody, Matthew, and Michelle each deliver with verve and sizzle. The director CJF does a marvelous job in steering this tale. Nic P (writer/creator) aptly mines the grit and metaphysical interiors of these complex characters. Moments of dark humor and quirky facial expressions (from WH) are sprinkled into the mix, to good effect. The cinematography, stellar soundtrack, and production design were beautifully executed throughout. <br/><br/>The dialogue sounds muddled at times, probably due to post-production of the audio track. <br/><br/>Episodes 7 and 8 did a sloppy job of unraveling the intricate crime thread. Minor characters were quickly referenced and sewn together, but without any supportive flashbacks. I like open-ended conclusions, but this was something different. Having said that, there were some genuinely bracing moments in the final episode.<br/><br/>The season's final moments managed to conveniently illuminate a certain philosophical gist. The mystery which had infused the entire season was somehow lacking though.<br/><br/>The disc with Episode 4 has an effective commentary where Nic ruminates with music sage T Bone Burnett. But Nic comes across as a bit of a sycophant when he's praising T Bone. There is another conversation between them at the series-end. While it's admirable that NP and TBB were grateful to work together, their expression of mutual admiration seemed effusive. I just watched the first season, and I can honestly say it's one of the best series that I've ever watched. As I watch more and more of McConaughey I just love his acting even more, one of the best actors out there right now for sure. I won't reveal any of the details, because you really want to find them out in the episodes. I won't even comment on the amazing intro and generally music, the camera work, the script etc. One of my main concerns every time I watch a series is how it's going to end. From a great series I expect a great ending. I got what I wanted and much more. Now, I'm really anxious about season 2. Will it live up to season 1? I'll go check it out. As for you, just go watch the series. It's absolutely worth it. I've been reading these reviews and i know everyone is different, but how anyone couldn't at least like this show is beyond me. i mean out of all the absolutely horrific shows that are aired. to give this show thumbs down is beyond me. OK i missed the first season for the most part and more of the 2nd. the third however was absolutely hands down my favorite show on. so sad it has come an gone.. i am so in love with Ray and Frank. their friendship is by far the oddest an best hand in hand.i do not want this to be the end of the road. i have come up with only one alternante way it can possibly come back. unfortuntantly i don't see it playing out... THANKS SO MUCH HBO SPOILER ALERT!<br/><br/>I'm in the middle of second season. Currently watching episode 5. I love the storyline and the characters so much I'm having a hard time choosing in my mind if the first story (season one) was better than this... or the other way around. <br/><br/>Rachel McAdams is brilliant. Her role of a detective with a kind of unhappy childhood is mesmerizing. Collin Farrel is always a solid actor and the performance he delivers so far I've seen. is truly the behaviour of a bad boy/right and moral human with a tendency of over reacting to every day life situations. He's the "hero" so far in my personal opinion. <br/><br/>Having said that. I have to give my thumb down to the character of Vince Vaughn. I don't know if I have to laugh or feel angry about his struggled character. He doesn't match up the gangster profile at all. The fight scene is like watching fake wresting done by amateurs. I'm not pleased with him at this point. <br/><br/>I have to honest. I'm hooked to this second season, but at this point... I could easily stop watching it and start season one all over again without regrets. Vince does not fill the spot as needed. This will keep you on the edge of your seat the entire time. The constant questions that arise by the little information you can gather will make this series an exhausting but amazing experience. Don't expect an action-packed TV-show, but if you are willing to listen to the story detective Rust Cohle (Matthew McConaughey) and detective Marty Hart (Woody Harrelson) have to tell, you will be rewarded with outstanding acting, impressive storytelling and magnificent cinematography. The scenery is depressing and the overall mood is dark, which I don't prefer, but it perfectly fits the show. <br/><br/>I don't know any detective series that is similar to True Detective. It is of the same quality as Sherlock, but the story progresses slower and the characters are not impeccable people. I have finished season 1 and it got me very curious about season 2. There will be some spoilers here, but the first episode of True Detective was kind of disappointing with some forced dialogue and some seriously bad acting in some parts. It feels like the legacy of the first season was hanging over this whole affair even tho i wasn't<br/><br/>trying to compare the two at all after all they are pretty different beasts at this point. Ironically i think the best part was Rachel Mcadam's character was the only one who felt real and alive. I only say ironically cause i saw some people speculate that she couldn't pull something like this off for some reason.<br/><br/>maybe because the first season incorporated elements of Southern Gothic and super naturalism it felt different than any other detective/noir show but obviously you can only go so far with that theme with different characters in different setting.<br/><br/>The director would be wise to make this feel less like true detective 2.0 and make it it's own thing even when all the major players came together at the end it felt cheesy since they don't all know each other.<br/><br/>The use of haunting dark music is probably the best thing about this episode.<br/><br/>to sum things up i really hope this show comes together and everything starts to gel because this show has so much potential. The first season of True Detective is a sharp, bleak look at Southern horror. From the title/intro onward, this show tapped into something stark and brutal, shaded with tones of moss, whiskey, and blood. Themes of human sacrifice (in many forms), weakness, and grim obsession are all explored masterfully in these eight episodes.<br/><br/>Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson have perhaps never been this good separately. Perhaps they bring to bear certain dark wisdom inherited from the wandering vastness of their Texas upbringing. Perhaps their own family stories infuse them with the thorny experience to navigate these roles. Whatever they're drawing from, they embody a twisting, wicked brilliance here - an intimate madness that sucks us into these characters' bleak lives and their hard scraping struggle.<br/><br/>Simply put, this is perhaps the most visually stunning series in years. Beyond simple camera work, is the delicate crafting of MOOD. Stylistically, this show is beautiful and harsh. We see, with acute clarity, a sprawl of green growing wildness all mangled up with the obscenely pretentious works of man. We see parishes of despair and sordid sameness, with dark patches of perverse, tainted, violence and death. With every outdoor scene, we sense that doom sleeps (and dreams) behind every moss-covered tree and broken down church.<br/><br/>And in those patches of doom, there are hints that some of the very underpinnings of this reality are dark and terrifying. The references to Chambers' The King in Yellow take all cutting elements of this production and bind them in a wicker-work of hopeless, calculated ruin. As the old poem goes - The shadows lengthen...In Carcosa. I ended up buying and watching this show based on the uproar of fans and the surprisingly high ratings. The show is extremely dry, the show drags on to hit its number of episodes(8) and you feel the hours wear on you. I liked episode 4 and I thought maybe it just took awhile to pick up as a lot of shows seem to getting characters intros and setting out of the way, I was wrong episode 4 was the climax of the series and if I had known how slow and boring the rest was I would've stopped watching. Overall it's still OK if you don't really care what you're watching but the really stereotypical characters and slow story was torture for me, I already sold my copy of the season because there is zero re-watch value here. In my best opinion if you like the dark murder mystery go watch the Hannibal TV series, or Se7en is always a winner:) Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson were stupendous in this - especially McConaughey - the man is a chameleon and inhabits another world when he acts. He plays a renegade cop with a dark and troubled past. Harrelson plays a family man with a wayward eye. Both have moral flexibility but a real sense of their worth as Cops and investigating the murky world of paedophile serial killers with a strange religious overtone - a sort of animism type voodoo cult.<br/><br/>This is not a TV show for the faint hearted, squeamish or easily offended. There is bad language, violence, nudity, graphic sex scenes and disturbing scenes of the crimes - although much of the horror of the story is anticipated from the spooky opening credits, and suggested rather than shown explicitly (thank goodness). There is an overarching feeling of dread and from one episode to the next in this mini-series the viewer had NO idea what was going to happen. The story jumps back and forth in the timeline, focusing on Internal Affairs interviews about the two main characters being investigated for misconduct... It shows the antagonism between the two main characters before filling in the back story around the interviews.<br/><br/>Brilliant script, story and acting... Even the scenery shots were unsettling. The dialogue was fast paced and not dumbed down. You had to keep up and sometimes with the strong Louisianna/South accents it was hard to follow but you have to listen carefully to hear all the important facts and clues. Superb. Edge of the seat and gripping right to the final credits.<br/><br/>What makes it unique, intriguing and compelling is how it differs from your run-of-the-mill murder mystery - there's no formula, no predictability and nothing to hang your hope on as the task seems to be an impossible one; just two men against the system, outside of the system and often using its seedy underbelly. Dark, brooding, sinister and unnerving and angry - the two characters don't work well together and there is constantly the stress of their antagonism against the backdrop of the stressful plot. <br/><br/>Highly recommend this rogue-cop type series if you like your action dark, quiet and insidiously visceral. True Detective came as a surprise to me, because it offered original material and a powerful performance by the cast. It has it's own problems in terms of plot development and ended with a slightly disappointing finale, but nevertheless kept me wanting for more after each episode.<br/><br/>I start my review with these remarks, because crime thrillers are were the US productions have become increasingly week in the past years. Therefore True Detective is the first US show in a long while that can come close to the heavyweights such as The Bridge and The Killing. Of course, i mean the Scandinavian originals Bron/Broen and Forbrydelsen, not the remakes.<br/><br/>Matthew McConaughey delivers one of the best roles of his career, not only in terms of emotion, but also transformation. Woody Harrelson was almost as fine, but his character was simply not at the same level of inner tension. Anyhow, i also want to point out the end of Episode 4 as one long breathtaking scene... Yes this series is a different type than the other crime serieses but is very boring at the same time
The crimes are really a good ones and very mysterious as well but the acting and the way the story was being told are totally boring Well maybe I don't know what I'm talking about because this is the first time I've watched this series. But I say that Mahershala Ali, teamed up with Stephen Dorff as his partner, OWN this series. And the makeup artists definitely have to be given their due. The story starts in 1980. Two children from a messed up home, to say the least, disappear into thin air on Halloween. The story goes from 1980, to 1990, to 2015. They find the young boy almost immediately, sadly dead. But the mystery of where the little girl is just will not let the two detectives rest until they finally find out what happened to her. The whole brilliance of this series is the way the scenes change from 1980 to 1990 to 2015, so seamlessly, back and forth and back and forth, that as you watch, you adapt to the time jumps pretty quickly. And the makeup used to age the characters is absolutely incredible. When at one point, in 2015, they talk about 'something they did" during the investigation, you know it's something horrible. And it is. I would have rather had a few less f-bombs scattered through out the story but the scenes and dialogue are so painful and so explosive, that there just doesn't seem to be another word out there yet to emphasize the horrific nature of the situations that come up. As the decades go on, the black detective and the white detective become closer than brothers. They also fight like brothers. But there is so much for everyone to take away from this story. Just make sure you are ready to pay attention. The new aeries is outstanding and deserves all the praise it can get. Unbelievable We should not make the mistake lf comparing this season with the first one. The third season of True Detective so far has been good, with an incredible acting performance by Ali. I have only seen the first episode yet and I'm like OMFG! This is fabulous. I didn't see it for a long time thinking it wouldn't be good but boy was I wrong. I believe this is somewhere on the levels of Breaking Bad. Matthew McConaughey is darn good by the way. Sorry I don't have much advice but you can see that just the first episode has me thrilled..... I especially advice to people out there who are postponing it for some other show, just don't, this will be worth your while...and I still have to write more lines....so.... I am also super excited about the Superman vs Batman movie. I won't be watching the Suicide Squad movie cause its kinda really dark, at least that's what I got from the trailer and this is my first review. Back to True Detective this is simply a must watch. I tried this series at least 10 different times because of the high reviews. Truth be told it's unnecessarily SLOW!!! I fell asleep multiple times trying to watch! Acting is great but plot drags FOREVER + should have been only 3 episodes long. Instead they spread it out wayyy too long. Season one 6/10 season 2 3/10 ( DONT BOTHER) season 3 6.5/10. Season one was damn slow and boring with all those flash backs. still excellent acting and directing. Looks like they got that essence back that only the first session managed to deliver. Fantastic show, this 3rd season is pure quality in directing, producing and filming. Season 1 was good because of acting... season 2 was a disaster, season 3 is ok....but I can't understand how this slow drama got this 9 rating.... really that much rating ðŸ¤” This is the best series ever made. Season 1. I did not like season 2 and 3. The killings are disturbing yet Matthew McConaugheys character is fascinating and dark. Darkest series ever made. In the top ten list, surely. Watched all three series and came away exhausted. They had the potential to be great, but each one was over-long and should have been edited to about three episodes. Instead the great acting was superseded by tedium and as others have mentioned, the storylines were all over the place. Not exciting despite having good actors. This review is for the third season of "True Detective":<br/><br/>Now, having seen the entire third season of "True Detective", I can say that this was a solid, well acted one and a clear rebound after the second season's doldrums. The performances from the three leads, Mahersala Ali, Stephen Dorff and Carmen Ejogo were excellent and strong. I also liked the chemistry the characters had with each other in the portrayal of their relationships, Mahersala Ali with Stephen Dorff, and Mahersala Ali with Carmen Ejogo.<br/><br/>Never did any of the characters feel like a third wheel or dead weight, like in the show's second season...it was more like the tripod which anchored the season's storyline and plot points. The supporting cast was just as good, with a special shut-out to Scoot McNairy.<br/><br/>I like how the story unfolded and kept moving between the three distinct timelines. This season's themes were time, memory, space and the stories that bind all of that, the stories that define us and the people in our lives The ending was soo appropriate and cathartic...almost therapeutic.<br/><br/>No, this season doesn't have the hype and "wow" factor of the first, but it doesn't matter since it doesn't have to, because it can definitely stand on its own. I hope "True Detective" continues, because I think there are more compelling stories to tell in this anthology format.<br/><br/>8 out of 10 Season one was great! Season two left me clueless, drained and annoyed. Rarely write reviews and I am coming out of the comfort to give my best rating for Series 1. I have watched lot of movies/series related to investigation and I can say for sure that, Series 1 was one of the best I have ever watched (along with MindHunter) and I consider it as master piece.<br/><br/>Matthew and Woody actions are impeccable. They set the bar so high that Series 2 fails to achieve. Series 1 was fantastic with the story line, chilling Louisiana settings, family emotions, classic deep investigative work (which is what I normally look for) and keeps folks very engaged over 8 episodes. Kudos to the entire team!!<br/><br/>Series 2 is bit of a disappointment after watching Series 1. Lot of action, guns and series 2 was missing lot of classic investigative style work. I was tempted to write a letter to Nic Pizzolatto to urge him to get back to writing about subtleties of investigation and not go down the Hollywood action path (Hopefully he will read this). Collin and other Guy, were decent in acting but they don't fit into investigative line. They are better suited for action roles are some. In addition they play these boring songs in the bar when Vince and collin meet in the bar. True Detective's season 1 is trully a masterpiece. What a great story with great performances of actors, esspecially Matthew. Misterycal drama that slowly getting to us and with every single episode just make us to watch more and more, shame there is only 8 episodes, but 8 very quality. Just great. Season 2- watched a half of first episode and saw that everything is different from story to cast and that what I saw was really bad, you can try to watch it but better not. How they succed to ruin so great show they dont know either. This is an anthology TV series created by Nic Pizzolatto.<br/><br/>Season 1. In 1995 Louisiana, detectives Marty Hart (Woody Harrelson) and Rust Cohle (Matthew McConaughey) investigate a murder. Seventeen years later, they are interviewed after another murder of the same nature despite their claim that they apprehended the killer back in 1995. Director Cary Fukunaga brings a cinematic vision above almost anything on TV. McConaughey was in the midst of his McConausance. His pairing with Harrelson is perfect. It's different and a must-see. It's exciting to see what this duo would do every week.<br/><br/>Season 2. In the town of Vinci, California, city manager Ben Caspere is killed. Vinci Police detective Ray Velcoro (Colin Farrell), CPH officer Paul Woodrugh (Taylor Kitsch), and Ventura County detective Ani Bezzerides (Rachel McAdams) all claim the case. Criminal Frank Semyon (Vince Vaughn) had invested in a project with Caspere but his money is missing. The story is a little bit of a mess. That's not to say the first season is a paragon of logic and easy storytelling. However, Fukunaga seems to be able to cover it up with his style. The visual style has regressed back to more like high quality TV. The new cast tries their best. Kitsch's story is probably the least compelling. McAdams and Farrell could be a solid lower level replacement of the McConaughey-Harrelson. Nothing could really replace that magical lightning strike. I am still not sold completely with Vaughn. It's some of his best work but I can imagine plenty of character actors who could do a superior job. There are some really interesting sections even though the story doesn't always hold together. This is a good try and not the disaster that some may claim.<br/><br/>Season 3. It's 1980 West Finger, Arkansas. Tom (Scoot McNairy) is beside himself when his two kids go missing. Wayne Hays (Mahershala Ali) and Roland West (Stephen Dorff) are state police detectives in charge of the search. Hays finds the body of the boy but the girl remains missing. Ten years later, Hays is brought back in to be interrogated about the case. It's revealed that the girl's fingerprints have been found at a robbery and she's presumed to be still alive. This is a bounce back year for the show. It's mostly due to Mahershala Ali. He is the sun, the stars, and the moon. I'm less impressed with the timeline jumping around during the season. I wonder if after the first episode with the fingerprints reveal, the show should switch back to a straight forward timeline story telling. Also, the mystery of the missing girl is not always the most compelling. After hearing about the pink room, it's a simple matter of waiting for them to find the room. The only reason to keep watching season one past the first couple episodes is to see what happens with Monaghan's character. The other two leads are totally boring (and annoying.. who talks like that !!!). The main crime story is uninteresting at best... what would have been the more intriguing approach would to have made her (Monaghan) the partner with McConaughey, and Harrelson the part-time stay-at-home dad... with all the resulting, complicated sub-plot possibilities. Then stuff would have been much more interesting all way round (especially in the squad-room).<br/><br/>Going to give it another couple episodes watching, but am very doubtful will be able to go much further. At the time had just come off the series finish of Justified, and hoped this might have been a worthwhile addition to the viewing lineup. Sadly, it just confirms how special that modern day western truly was.. and how hard it will be to find any worthwhile replacement.<br/><br/>No matter how many films they might review, critics are still human, with all the biases the rest of us have. And it's extremely natural that comparisons be made This show has independent story-lines from season to season, and if you can watch season two first. And having a greater desire to watch the principal actors of the second season, I'd choose that one to view first anyway.<br/><br/>With that, all I can say was I had no huge problem with the second season production. What I believe didn't help the production was the time necessary to get into the story-line, and then way the characters were continually confusing to keep up with.. and the fact several of the leads don't make it through at the end. But I did enjoy it overall, and would recommend it. And it did introduce me to the talent of Lera Lynn which was a huge bonus. It would most definitely benefit from a second viewing, to get it all down and sorted out more accurately.<br/><br/>If most of the critics liked one over two.. then they just watched them out of turn. And if and when they do a third, I know which one I would be voting to replicate. I just watched the season two premiere off HBO GO, and I'm like WTF is going on-?? LOL Season one went back and forth between the present day and like twenty years ago, whereas season two seemed to be all set in the hear and now, just rotating multiple story lines. <br/><br/>You've got Colin Farrell's crooked cop, who does occasional jobs for a local crime lord (Vince Vaughn-he's either a crime lord or a shady real estate developer- same diff-?? LOL), and has some other domestic issues including a son who gets picked on at school. You've got Rachel McAdams as another cop, who has a crazy self-help guru dad (David Morse), and a sister working in porn! And then you've got a "ChiPs" officer played by Taylor Kitsch, who is yet another degree of altogether messed-up-?? LOL <br/><br/>At first I'm like- THIS is "True Detective"-??- how can they just stamp that name on ANY-thing after that ground-breaking first season. However, THAT being said- *possible SPOILER*- everything came together at the end in a way it's got me hooked for the rest of season one! Just hoping this title will provoke some obviously uneducated people to walk away from this series. This is really not for you. This is, what's the word - smart. It's not ''entertaining'', seriously, I don't know what that word even means. I don't want to be entertained. What is ''entertaining'', what is ''not boring''...<br/><br/>Please, just walk away.<br/><br/>So many little clues to season 1, so many connections, even some obvious ones at Casper's place, so many great references to Kubrick and Lynch, a new intellectual level, upgrading the season 1. Sorry, just walk away, I want to enjoy this, highbrow style. Go and don't look back, it will bore you, you will turn in stone if you just gaze at it once more. Fly, you fools! 4.2/10 for Season 2
0.1/10 for Season 3<br/><br/>Basically, just watch season 1 and skip the other two, especially season 3, it's unwatchable trash that should never have been made. It's a shame they couldn't have matched the greatness that was the first season with the follow-ups but in that regard it reminds me a lot of Fargo, that being the first installment it so good
that it'd be nearly impossible to meet anyone's expectations in subsequent seasons. First two seasons were so good, but imo, season 3 was a complete waste of time. Kept watching because I was so curious as to what actually happened. Well through all the rewinding to understand what was being said, the flipping back and forth through three time frames (my least favourite of filming these days), the truth is finally told in a simple 10 minute story! Very disappointing for sure. Ah, but the music was great! True Detective is an American anthology crime drama television series created and written by Nic Pizzolatto. The series, broadcast by the premium cable network HBO in the United States, premiered on January 12, 2014. Each season of the series is structured as a disparate, self-contained narrative, employing new cast ensembles, and following various sets of characters and settings.
1 Seasons -10<br/><br/>2 Seasons - 9<br/><br/>3 Seasons - 10 This season came back to its roots but not like everyone wanted to, it came back to the relationships between the characters, how the different circumstances define them although some people think this season was bored and the finale was disappointing, I think it was a good ending that we already expect but because they wanted us to know it. Pizzolato wanted us to be him in that last episode and giving us that not so reasonable doubt about if Wayne knows it or not. You know that something is worth watching if you're sucked in by the first episode and the latest offering of True Detective certainly does that! Continuing on from the dark and broody style of series one actors Mahershala Ali and Stephen Dorff give strong performances along with a well chosen cast.The story this time is back to the roots of season one but being 3 episodes in its too early to tell.But so far I'm hooked! This could be very well the Season two we all were hoping for finally delivered. First season was a good gritty crime drama. The second season is another story. It drags on with insignificant dialogue and rarely delivers anything interesting. To put it simply, season 2 is just straight up boring. First season was interesting. Good actors and interesting plot, there was drama, mystery, action. I would recommend to watch it, maybe it is not 9,4 (which I think is a bit to high) but surely strong 8. None of this can be said about second season. Actors not great but worse is story line it self, it was boring, more political and gang/mob related,so many names and tangled relationship that you don't care at all, so absolutely different from first season. I got bored during first episode but gave a chance for few more, but sorry to say the more you watch the more you are bored. I saw last episode as well and OMG it was so predictable. I just don't understand how can same TV series seasons be so different from one another. The only thing that was perfect in season first and was the same in season two is spaces and landscapes, so the people who were responsible for space search and who took the shots of it should get some reward, as it was great and huge pleasure to watch. OK my title says it all Season 01 was awesome...<br/><br/>Why? Because Season 01 was way better with the mystery-cult thing it was way better i mean when McConaughey sees the symbol in the birds in episode 2 the whole "Yellow King" and "carcosa" mystery it was awesome even the "spaguetti face monster" thing it was awesome Season 01 was TRUE DETECTIVE...<br/><br/>With Season 02, which i decide to rate 8, foe me it felt like we get down to a cop drama i mean nothing new corrupt politicians, drugs, a victim, a prostitute ring blah blah blah corrupt characters nothing new really... and i know that some will say Season 01 was NOTHING NEW EITHER but it had that atmosphere that dark like the line says "Touch the Darknes... and Darkness touches back" Season 01 was awesome a perfect 10 but 8 for Season 02? I believe that a TV show to be awesome each season has to surpass the previous one but here it doesn't and i don't care what my brother said to me "If someone ask say SEASON TWO was better than ONE otrherwise people may lose interest" i like Season 01 better all the way and maybe i do not agreed with a friend of mine that, after watching both season in THREE DAYS, said "So THAT was Season 02? Where's TRUE DETECTIVE? I felt like a i watched two different shows Wheres Season 02 of TRUE DETECTIVE?" but i agree that season 01 was super... season 02 still passes but it was not good as season 01 (yeah i don't care what some say about "do not compare seasons of the same show") I hope Season 03 (if there's gonna be) to return to the Season 01 mystery thing i mean even season 02 had bad choices in the cast i mean Vince Vaugh is a good actor but he doesn't have the gangster type that Frank Semyon needed don't get me wrong is like Jim Carrey i cant see him doing something "serious" or Eddie Murphy...) Im still waiting to get better... till now I even recommend to see Season 02 FIRST and then Season 01 (its an anthology so the order do not matter) if you wanna a "good" show 02 first 01 then otherwise you may (50-50 chances) feel disappointed... its all on you... 10 stars for episodes 1 to 7. Outstanding performances by Harrelson & McConaughy - no doubt about this.<br/><br/>But I was very disappointed by the last episode. It was just like any other series would end: the good guys win, the bad guys lose. And the Senator who is behind all of this is not/will not be subject to prosecution...<br/><br/>Of course, the good guys got some serious injuries from the last fight with the bad ones...but, yeah, you know the drill.<br/><br/>From the first minute of the last episode, you can easily predict how it's going to end... <br/><br/>So I just spent 7 hours waiting for a grand finale but I was disappointed by another cheap "Colt-Seavers-revelation".<br/><br/>Anyway, 8 stars for the whole series!<br/><br/>...And still waiting for some more to come! Forgive the above grabber, it was scripted in earnest. Silence of the Lambs unraveled in 8 exceptional episodes. Harrelson and McConaughey riding a wave of glory; Rampart, Mud, Dallas Buyers, Out of the Furnace. Story telling at its best and the leads put their money where their mouth is, EP style. I have been impressed out of my pants by the 'New Vision'of television, BB, GOT, SoA, Banshee and Les revenants. Both leads are menacing, I haven't been to the cinemas in ages, any point or purpose? It's good to be alive. For me it's personal, to see the leads grab both reins in the last 5 years and build in roads to fan forgiveness has been a journey unto itself. The first few lines of this review is simple truth, the rest is scripture, if only to make up the 10 lines required to meet the guidelines. Season 1 was mesmerizing thanks to the chemistry of Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson. The plot with the serial killer is secondary to the story. It's the character dynamic, dialogue and arc that holds our interest and elevates this detective noir show. 9/10<br/><br/>Season 2 I didn't bother to watch due to the universally bad reviews.<br/><br/>Season 3 was a bland slow burn character study. Somehow I managed to get through all the episodes but I wish I hadn't as the conclusion offered no resolution or catharsis. There was not much story to speak of but then again this was meant as a dark brooding character study of a detective obsessed with a case. It's still watchable but disappointing. I'd rate it a generous 4/10. If they added more story and quickened the pace I would rate it higher.<br/><br/>Bottom line is just watch season 1. Skip season 2 and 3. The first season I liked it but not much, It was good not gonna lie but not for me
Season 2 gave us a good beginning and a s*** ending like why are hbo doing this??
The last season is a masterpiece that I can never forget <3<br/><br/>So
Season 1: 7.8
Season 2: 4
Season 3: 10 The core of this show is pretty good. The filler material is right of the "how to make a series" handbook. You will become tired of Woody Harrelson's demeanor and relationship with his wife...filler material. In sum, I'd advise to watch it for free, but do not pay to watch. Fell in love with TD after finally watching it several years after it's release (took plenty of people to finally convince to watch the show). It is now hands down my favorite show to have ever watched, having watched season 1 3 times already I still find myself having the urge to restart season 1 again. Of course with the bump they had on season 2 I couldn't say the same. Now, for season 3 I am doing my best to be open minded and as much as it's dark, tensing vibe that I grasp from the show it just doesn't hit as hard as season 1 and I just don't know if that couldn't ever be topped. If TD really wants to make an absolute masterpiece season than they should consider a prequel of season one Ruston Cohle back story including his time with the biker gang, how he got there, his first marriage, etc. I feel like there is a lot of potential with just that and could even expand on how Rust got to his '
realist/pessimist mentality through what he has seen. This would be one hell of a season cause let's be honest, Matthew Mcconaughey truly is the True Detective, and that's not to disrespect Woody Harrelson, Mahershala Ali, and Stephen Dorff. I'm just saying, a lot of completely missed potential there, Cohle has such a back story that true fans really want to dig into. Please find way to split up the seasons. Its really lame-o The sets are great, the camera is great - heck even the plot COULD be great if it wasn't all wrapped up in this pretentious artsy-fartsy pseudo-philosophical shell. Maybe this just isn't my cup of tea, but I don't think that is the issue here. The issue for me is the way they're trying to deliver the philosophical ramblings - it's just done in a way that is so uninteresting, so boring and lacking entertainment. Really I don't mind movies or TV shows pondering the "deep stuff", but it has to be done in a way so it doesn't distract from the actual plot and it needs to be done in a way that a) doesn't destroy the suspense of disbelief and b) doesn't kill all suspense. Sadly I cannot say that they succeeded in doing so. YMMV, apparently many people DO like the show, maybe even precisely because of the reasons I disliked it. The second season Start and end with nothing to show for it. <br/><br/>SO, yes this rating and review is strictly for season one. <br/><br/>In True Detective, performances by Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey reel the viewer in, while the style, vision and direction make it hard to turn away.<br/><br/>Rustin Cohle: I'd consider myself a realist, alright? But in philosophical terms I'm what's called a pessimist... I think human consciousness is a tragic misstep in evolution. We became too self- aware. Nature created an aspect of nature separate from itself - we are creatures that should not exist by natural law... We are things that labor under the illusion of having a self, that accretion of sensory experience and feelings, programmed with total assurance that we are each somebody, when in fact everybody's nobody... I think the honorable thing for our species to do is to deny our programming. Stop reproducing, walk hand in hand into extinction - one last midnight, brothers and sisters opting out of a raw deal. <br/><br/>Detective Maynard Gilbough: Mr Cohle? Mr Cohle. What happened in two thousand and two? <br/><br/>Detective Rust Cohle: If you wanna arrest me, go ahead. You wanna follow me? Come on. You wanna see something? Get a warrant. Thanks for the beer. Beyond that you wasted my King day, company men. POSSIBLE SPOILERS <br/><br/>So I guess I watched a different episode than everyone else. I've looked around the Internet and I'm seeing ridiculous negativity about this episode. It is the first episode of a whole new series basically. The characters are different and the story is different because it's not supposed to be like season 1. It was slow but it was slow because it was introducing the story and the characters. Some say it lacked story which is crazy! It's not going to jump into this murder right away like they did last season. This time we have 4 characters playing major roles. We have to know this people and that is what this episode does. It also looks great. The cinematography was fantastic. A lot of aerial shots that were okay but I hope it doesn't continue that way. However, it was cool for one episode. I thought it was great. I'm psyched for this season and if you like a good story then you will like it too. Well, the whole series is good. If I would need to rank season from best to worst, I would go with season 3, season 2 and at the end season 1. The most people praise season 1, but for my taste it was slow (something dynamic started to happen in episode 4 !!!) but the story was good, ending a little bit unrealistic. The picture was perfect in all seasons, pretty colors and good ambient. Selection of actors was really good in all seasons. Slow and meandering, this show goes nowhere and takes its sweet time getting there. It tries to be quirky to make up for a lack of story and character development, but it doesn't work at all. It's a shame too, given the top acting talent the producers have to work with. This is proof that even the best actors can't make a diamond from nothing no matter how good they are. Garbage in, garbage out. I watched up until the end of episode five of the first season and then couldn't take any more.<br/><br/>Glacially slow pacing and a razor-thin story stretched out over eight hours ultimately ruin what could have been a decent two hour movie in better hands.<br/><br/>If you need something to help you go to sleep, then this show is your prescription. If you're looking for a good police procedural or mystery, then you're better off with something else. This season is pretty good, well written and directed, of course performances are very good After giving up on season 1 after the first episode (I find tobacco use quite gross, and it was the entire point of the first episode as far as I could tell) I thought that perhaps season 2 wouldn't be so bad. And at first the smoking wasn't quite so in-your-face. But as the season progressed, the smoking increased exponentially. In the world of True Detective, 100% of the adult population smokes. Take the Tobacco Money and run, greed over integrity or ethics.<br/><br/>True Detective does not deserve the high rating it has here on IMDB. It takes more than great actors. The writing isn't as good as it thinks it is, and the story has too many coincidences, none adding to the story. Fantastic. Beautiful. Great acting. May have to watch the first two seasons now? I agree with most reviewers, that this season is closer in style to Season 1 and much more interesting than the overly-gratuitous Season 2. I just finished watching the Season 3 episode titled "If You Have Ghosts" and it was good enough that I felt compelled to write a review. They saved the best for last in that episode. The emotions shared between Ali and Dorff as old men with lots of regrets felt real and the resolution at the end, to pair up again in some crazy fashion, was a great plot device. I'm looking forward to watching them solve the mystery in a slow old-man pace that matches the speed of this genre of detective stories. For 3 seasons now have watched the crime drama "True Detective" on "HBO" and I must say it's a great and super creation by Nic Pizzolatto for the way the anthology is done it's like TV cinema at it's best the height of visual art! Each season is a different story with a different case of unsolved crime, with a different setting and geography location and different detectives are involved. The cases spin with drama and clues and different subplots that involve different suspects as the secrets revealed are often dark and personal demons from the closets of the people involved and it also is a showcase and highlight of each detectives life in the form of professional and personal drama matters.<br/><br/>The cases have involved brutal murders, abductions, serial killings, all twisted with themes of sex, class, race, economics, politics, and memory that involves time with different periods of years and mythology and religion. Each episode keeps you glued with twists of new clues and suspects all told thru flashback form the writing is blunt and raw with many scenes being honest and brutal. Overall really a winner and fine series from "HBO" one of it's best ever for modern "TV". A very well executed mini series featuring two high level talents, Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson.<br/><br/>This show really takes you in and captures you right from the first episode. The camera work is beautiful. The shots of the Louisiana terrain and farmland is awesome and adds to the story and experience.<br/><br/>It has a very dark and dreadful feeling to it, which enhances its' cinematic experience, along with its' acting. It's hard to believe how high television has soared above movies after watching this. Many scenes are way too good for television and would be more common on the big screen.<br/><br/>This is definitely worth the watch. Story and acting in Season 3 are disappointing. Especially Carmen Ejogo, terrible acting... In last episode I just skipped parts with her. This season is very good. There's only one thing missing: Razorbacks! You can't go 2 inches in Northwest Arkansas; the whole state, for that matter, without seeing Razorbacks! Man this show is very well put together. The American horror story 4 detectives. Noir crime show about homicide cops who spend decades on infamous murders that become their obsession. The first season is great. The second season sucks monkey feet. The third season is back to the basics and a lot of fun. Highly recommended for fans of noir crime genre. *** There Will Be SPOILERS! ***<br/><br/>I'm reviewing the first episode, which I saw during HBO's free preview weekend. I guess I might get to see other episodes at some point. But, I'm certainly not paying for HBO! Almost all of what they have on is attention-grabbing, critic-bait garbage like "Girls." I'm certainly not going to fill their coffers for that stuff!<br/><br/>The opening titles don't help the show too much! It's the usual cable artsy-tartsy affair. If you know Maurice Binder, the famous opening-titles creator who did the James Bond films, the opening titles here are like his work if he had been on heavy barbiturates! By leaps and bounds, the highlight here is Matthew McConaughey. His performance should instantly get an Emmy! What he does in his opening scene earns that alone. Woody Harrelson's performance is the usual steady hand on the wheel.<br/><br/>McConaughey has a character who is your typical troubled serial-killer-profiler type. But, the writer does push it a bit far, since his character not only is a smoker and a drinker, but also a taker of drugs and has a freaky apartment situation, where all he has is a mattress on the floor and a stack of serial-killer books. Definitely laying it on too thick!<br/><br/>Not surprisingly, the women here do not have too much to do but be housewives, hookers or whatever. Disappointing in that having some strong female characters could have provided some good balance for the show.<br/><br/>The killing that is the centerpiece of the show seems to be pretty much a repeat of a key one from the first season of "Hannibal." Probably coincidence, but it gives a sense of something we've seen before.<br/><br/>T. Bone Burnett is the musical darling of Hollywood. For whatever reason, he is considered the great, go-to guy for earthy music, when it's needed. To me, he has done great work in the past, like with the Coen Brothers' "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" But, I don't really get what he's doing these days. His work on "Inside Llewyn Davis" did nothing for me. Just depressing songs, nothing more.<br/><br/>Here, he has this mumbly, what-the-heck opening song starting the show, and fairly indiscriminate music otherwise throughout the show.<br/><br/>The production values are good otherwise, with the cinematography being the best aspect. The program has gotten off to a good start. Viewers will have to see where it goes from here.<br/><br/>******* (7 Out of 10 Stars) Amazing. I've watched 5 episodes now and it's mind blowing.<br/><br/>Just amazing. Well everything depends on one's personal taste and mood.
I'll explain what I liked and the parts I didn't appreciate in True Detective Season 1:<br/><br/>Positive:
Great acting. Story becomes gripping toward the middle of the season. Nice sceneries. Potential for an awesome mystery. Story draws you in if you're patient. Builds up your expectations at the beginning and in the middle.<br/><br/>Negative:
Story too slow even at the start. Too many plot holes and the mediocre ending clashes with the strong beginning. I personally found it too dark. Don't watch during a period of your life when you're down. I'm an agnostic and a pragmatic person myself and so I partly identified with the Rusty character, which is why it was like watching myself talk as he talked about his thoughts. For someone who considers him a crazy man, his character is harmless. As to someone like me, because I believe in most of what he had to say, I don't need reminders of the harsh reality of the world.<br/><br/>Why I'm rewatching Dexter:
At this point I'm in a period of my life where I need something uplifting... So I watch and rewatch Dexter. The latter is full of colour, Miami sunshine, Cuban music, dark humour and of course, a human quasi-superhero and unrealistic Bollywood-style coincidences and happy endings! Another plus: watching a show that you've already seen can be relaxing for your mind.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for me the negative outweighs the positive, hence the low rating. Ali & Dorff are incredible together absolutely fantastic acting. Dark and gritty. Season 3 my favorite. From the first second, you find the characters are damaged from long years of drugs, drink and the job. They are horrible to their l9bed 9bes, they are horrible to each other. You cannot care for them at all. The only reason I gave it one star is that they pronounce southern Louisiana names correctly. Otherwise, slow to non-existent plot movement. General black feeling all around. Can't continue. Can't imagine the 9 rating here. Totally not justified! I watched first two episodes. Nothing happened in those. Its very very slow. I could not waste any more time in watching. I seriously don't understand why people are saying that season 1 was great and season 2,3 are garbage.
As the series is highly rated here, I started watching season 1.
First episode's over. Nothing happened.
I thought it was a slow burn and continued to watch, just to know why it was rated 9/10.
I kept on watching episode after episode even if I was feeling so disgusted at how it was turning out. (First, The investigation wasn't going anywhere. Second, whatever they are doing was plain boring. And at last, the series started to get personal where Woody Harrelson cheats on his wife and his wife cheats on him with Matthew McConaughey).
I thought atleast the climax would set off all the odds. But even the final episode wasn't that good. It was just fine making the entire season a pure disappointment.<br/><br/>If it was rated like 6 or even 7, it wouldn't have even watched this. Only fan boys are to be blamed for this higher rating.<br/><br/>If you are planning to watch this series, better avoid it and watch Bong Joon Ho's "Memories of Murder". what this series failed to deliver in whooping 8 hrs was perfectly depicted in around 2.5 hrs in that Korean masterpiece.

Fantastic It was going back and forth too much. A little more chronology would have been better in my opinion. "True Detective" is another great show made by the best streaming service ever and that's HBO.Every show that HBO made is either great/masterpiece or at leaat good but none of them are bad.
In this case,the 1st season of True Detective is amazing followed by the 2nd season which was just good,it wasn't bad but neither great.
And we've reached the 3rd season which is now the last season as well as the masterpiece of the show.
Why I think that the 3rd season is the best,well cuz it has what every great show needs to have and those things are : an amazing story,a cast whose acting is beyond astonishing( Mahershala Ali as well as Stepehn Dorff acting performance is speeechless) and the show is the best combination between action-drama and suspense.
Another great thing about the 3rd season is the way that end the season,it tricked us by giving us more than one ending(2-3).
When Watts tells the two detectives the truth he knew by saying that Julie is now dead and after that I've expected the season to end but that's not the ending.
The real ending is thatt Julie is alive and now she has a familly with her classmate, the one who had a crush on her when she disappeared. Julie never died. She married her childhood sweetheart and lives with her daughter in a lovely house on a quiet street in Arkansas.
Overall,True Detective is not just a great show but it's one of those shows that are worth rewatching from time to time,especially the 3rd season. Season 1 is a masterpiece. Will see about the other two... The season moves you through 4 or 5 different years brilliantly.
I didn't see the end coming even though I was thinking of 5 different endings. Just wait for it... wait for it... let the Season move you forward with the story.
The soundtrack is excellent. I recommend high quality headphones.
I watch the whole season on 3 different days. That helps because of the high amount of details you have to remember.
I know Mahershala Ali from hidden figures. I loved his character, even though was small, but he can act and move you to tears.
I'll keep watching every new season. The writing is brilliant. Contains small spoiler which you find out in e1<br/><br/>I never review, but i see people call s3 boring and for the first time feel i need to leave a review....<br/><br/>I almost didn't watch s3 because s2 was so disappointing i quit half way through, but I'm glad I did.<br/><br/>Yes the show is slow, but isn't that the whole point?
You slowly work up to the ending, but this time through the eyes of a man who is slowly losing his memories and is trying really hard to solve the case that has haunted him for 35 years.<br/><br/>The acting is amazing, Mahershala Ali just wauw! And pleasantly surprised by Stephen Dorff, usually not one of my favorite actors.<br/><br/>Hats of to the make up departement, some of the best aging make up i've ever seen.<br/><br/>There are no high speed chases, only one shoot out and only a few people get beat up. It that's what you're looking for, then yes, give this show a pass and go watch the fast and the furious reruns.<br/><br/>But if you don't mind the slow pace give s3 a shot. You might be surprised.<br/><br/>Also on a different note:
1/10 is not a rating. If you can't be bothered to rate properly don't bother at all. The first to seasons were good, entertaining throughout the whole seasons. With season 3 it gets so boring that I gave up midway, couldn't even complete the whole season. If you like some sort of entertainment and not just a story developing slower than the speed of paint drying than skip season 3 and watch something else. Maybe polar opposite of season 3, Attack on Titan? One of the best crime TV shows as of now... Love it! Didn't actually watch season 2-3 But season 1 was really good. Rust Cohle's story is really awesome and acting is so. Watch it now All the seasons were very good but this is a list of the seasons from best to worst.
1.S1
2.S2
3.S3
Just so your prepared of what's to come The first season fully justified the atmosphere-meaning that was in the title of the series. Great acting, great story and the way things are served. The second season was slightly worse in terms of this atmosphere, but it was still interesting to watch and the main characters still justified the name of the series. And the ending pleased with the fact that it was made correct, and not spoiled by some stupid cliches.
But the third series seemed dull and boring. The detective story is present, but everything seems to be artificially stretched out and in some places as if it were artificial. A reception with "leaps in time" generally pushes away with its excessive frequency. The only positive moment of the third season is an interesting ending. Although it was partially disappointed after the author had been intriguing the whole season, and in the end such a... commonplace. Seen a lot of detective series but this one just stands out and dominates the others. All seasons execute and display absolute excellence. All major characters are phenomenal and the actors portraying them are just pure class. Dare to say one of the top crime series I have ever seen on Television. Top notch direction with human element attached to such gruesome climax. Mathew and Woody OMG!! what performances. I am blown away with this series. Will miss it so dearly. I liked the way series ends without too much fuss about what has been discovered or how heroic the lead actors were etc. Show focused solely on delivering the story. Any amount of praise of the makers of this show is not enough.
Kudos!!
BTW I haven't yet started season 2 or 3. Needs some time to digest this one. Could have cast two other leads for season 2. Should have picked up more accomplished actors for season 2. Would have been a 10 if the actors in seasons 1and 3 had filled in during season 2 . Instead they cast Vaughn and Farrell who happen to be my two least favorite actors of all time after Mel Gibson. Luckily he's not in this. Yet. Plus people didn't sarcastically remark "WHATEVER" in the 80s. That type of one worded sarcasm emerged in the past 15 years or so. Proving it's easier to mimic a drama taking place in the 1800s than in the 1980s. Overly modern out of era colloquiums irritate me to no end. Flats and Ali's character has too heavy a southern drawl which he mumbles. I can hardly hear what he's saying. I haven't watched the others still but season 1 is great. 10/10. Direction, Writing, Dialogues, Acting.. everything's perfect. Must Watch. This review is for season 2 with Colin Farrell and Vince Vaughn and Rachel McAdams. I watched the season out of order but saw all episodes.<br/><br/>What a mess, right? Even after reading many synopses and watching the whole thing I still don't feel like the pieces fit together neatly for maximum dramatic impact. Season 2 of "True Detective" has strong moments but much is lost in the cascade of overwhelming details. Everything seems overexplained and of equal importance and the key parts aren't emphasized well to leave a lasting impression, while the less important stuff is. The mystery is a total head scratcher although it has most of everything you could want for crime drama: power plays, gangs, corrupt police, drugs, sex and violence.<br/><br/>After a while you just go with it because the three shoddy detectives cracking the case bring a lot to the screen especially as the roles for Rachel McAdams (hard nosed detective) and Vince Vaughn (desperate gangster) are so about-face for the actors. McAdams, the prom princess is wracked through mud and a bad hairstyle. Vaughn the eternal nice guy is pulling out golden teeth and smashing whisky cups. I live for these risks, and the actors delivered so despite the mystery never coming together I still enjoyed this season.<br/><br/>Having said that there is so much bleakness present that it's hard not to come away depressed and angry at the ending which is maddening. In one scene Vaughn tells his lackey detective played by Colin Farrell that not knowing who is screwing him over is like having "blue balls in his heart" and that's the way I felt by the ending of season 2, just totally screwed over and lacking the right release.<br/><br/>Season 2 is highly frustrating in key areas but there is enough charisma present and enough moments of strong and deeply felt relationship dynamics that I still recommend watching it despite its reputation of major disappointment. You do feel these characters and like them despite how close they tow the line into the wretched side of human destruction and self sabotage. However despite saying this there is so much senseless destruction and a murder of things good that it's hard not to hate the show or the violence within it at the same time.<br/><br/>Very depressing, but sometimes redemptive in ways that is rare for TV. I don't know quite what score to give with this mishmash of characteristics, but feel like season 2 of "True Detective" deserves better than the 7/10 I should give. 8/10 for an insufferable, but engrossing crime drama. Season 1 of True Detective is, in my opinion. the best season of a TV series ever made. It simply has everything: a great story, fantastic storytelling, depth, brilliant acting, fascinating characters, and the slow-burning narrative is perfectly spiked with key developments throughout the season that keep you constantly on the edge of your seat for an amazingly tense and immersive experience. A very rare 10/10 in my book.<br/><br/>Season 2 is an extremely solid effort with a beautifully crafted neo-noir ambience, as the desolated landscapes of Louisiana are left behind for a more urban but equally opressing Californian setting. The story is interesting and the acting is good, but it fails to rise to the same level of excellency as its predecessor. A strong 8/10, in my opinion.<br/><br/>Season 3 tries to bring back some of the aspects that made Season 1 an instant cult classic, but as the episodes unfold you slowly start to realise that the story never really takes off. The narrative is kept lukewarm, constantly hinting at some significant breakthrough that is about to take place, but it never actually does. The slow-burning storytelling (of which I am a fan of) feels lacking without the crescendos culminating in major developments that we had on the first season, and then it all ends with a frankly underwhelming finale. An ok 7/10 in my opinion, which is a shame because all the ingredients were there. Saw some bad reviews for third season but my opinion is a bit different. I liked first season a lot.. great acting, plot.. everything. I would rate it 8.5/10.
Didn't like second season so much.. barely remember it. 6.5/10
Just finished 7th ep of season 3 .. episodes were so good it just kept me wanting more. Usually I do stuff on the phone while watching other TV shows but this was not the case with S3. Feel they decided to spice things up with "westworld's style" multiple timelines. I would say 8/10 for S3. McConaughey & Harrelson shown as cops who caught serial killer. My bad... Well dang, I am not normally easily impressed, Season 1 I will say is one of the premium of a detective TV series, I have definitely seen a LOT of very good detective series, this one is definitely 1 of my top 5.<br/><br/>Mathew McConaughey and Woody Harreslon gave a stellar performance. Note: I have not watched past season 1, and I have no intention of watching further.<br/><br/>While this show is far more believable than the standard crime show, it still lacks emotion, acting, or cinematography that would make it truly exceptional. That doesn't mean those aspects are poor, but they also aren't outstanding. I was surprised that even Harrelson and McConaughey weren't able to convince me of any strong emotions; I feel that they could have put more heart into a few more scenes to really hammer them home. Super underrated mcconaughey is brilliant!! Him and woody are a such a good duo So I just finished season 2 and I can say the show was pretty good. Not the best and I probably wouldn't watch it again like old Twin Peaks, but it's good.
There is a slight surprising change between season one and two though, the show doesn't continue where first left off. No more mystics and weird stuff, just crime and interpersonal relations. Also season 2 added quite a few shooting scenes etc which I didn't really enjoy. Season 1 plot was good, season 2 between 'meh' and 'ok' - good guys chasing bad guys, turning sides etc etc. What I really loved with season one was the atmosphere of dread and futility. Needless to say, Rust character was marvelous. Season two has that dark atmosphere and great characters too but... it's just not Rust Cohle. Anyway I think it's absolutely safe to watch season 2 first, then season1, so you don't have your hopes high. Woody and Matty are awesome actors and really set the scene for an awesome series. There's a great direction and cinematography that take this series to a dark noir crime genre. I highly recommend! True Detective is a spectacular series, but only season one actually, cause the second one is terrible, but still fine!<br/><br/>Now let's talk about the first season of True Detective:
It was great in so many ways.. actually it was great in every way! The cast, the performance, the story, the dialog, the direction and everything was definitely great and stunning!<br/><br/>The way the series itself is amazing! By "The way" I mean the darkness and the way the series is and the storytelling, all of that were the real meaning of greatness, in my opinion.<br/><br/>In fact, I think that this season is one of the greatest seasons of all time! For me, this season = a series, so it's one if the greatest SERIES of all the time for me!<br/><br/>Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson created such a great team together, as a story and acting too. I really want to see them together again, in a movie or a series. The rest of the cast was brilliantly performed too! I have no comment on the cast or their performances, cause it was totally amazing!<br/><br/>Actually I have no comment on the season at all! So as it obvious, I loved this season, and I'm gonna give this season 10/10 indeed!<br/><br/>Let's move to the second season of True Detective:
It wasn't really bad as a season stands on its own as a solid police drama, but it really was disappointing cause it has the name TRUE DETECTIVE, so it has to be worthy to have a name, such as this great series... But it simply blew it up!<br/><br/>The story is interesting and sometimes thrilling. My problems is the very slow telling, as because of that I hated it.. I didn't find any events to keep my fire up, instead of doing that, they just threw water on it! They did that by their performances, the slow story and the way it went super-dark! It was like everyone in this season had a terrible childhood and a way horrible life!<br/><br/>The only roles and performances I loved were Vince Vaughn as Frank Semyon and Taylor Kitsch as Paul Woodrugh.. and Colin Farrell as Ray Velcoro was fine. All the others -or most of them- were totally fake-acting!<br/><br/>The first episode was fine, as introducing the cast and the roles, the second one is boring, and the third is just the same, then the fourth was okay, but then the climax was average, until the seventh episode, it was amazing, the best in this season and then a very dark and opened season finale!<br/><br/>As I said, this season might have worked with me if it didn't have the name of True Detective!
But it have it anyways so I'm gonna give it 6/10.. I was going to give it less, but the seventh episode saved it!<br/><br/>So the average of True Detective is 8/10.. because of season two! Last 30 minutes of the final episode ruined it all. Detective Cohle got severe mental injuries and would serve mass. I'd call it a real plot twister. So sad. 8/10 For Season one. Did not think Season 2 had the marks for story, direction, cast or editing .6/10 is all I can give it. Brilliant acting, plot, script, direction, and beautiful cinematography for 1st season.
2nd season's acting is really flat, plot is not interesting, script is bad, camera is all over the highway views of LA... relationship of each character is very shallow... etc etc. 
Looking forward to the 3rd season. Very cool series but only 1 season with makkonohai and wudi, 2 season something like a dump with a Farrell and a girl makadams, xs it would be better if the dadario took a role in the chapters, although do not care 8/10 Just finished season 1 a few days ago and i definetly recommend it. <br/><br/>This TV Series is really something different than the others. I was beginning to get dull with tv shows we see nowadays as they all look alike, follow the same construction and tend to disappoint in the end.
With true detective, there's something new, with characters that have some depth, and a story that makes you want to live it.<br/><br/>I gave it only an 8, because let's be honest, it's not that perfect, Rust's character is really interesting and deep, but that's a bit too much in the end. That is still a good tv show that I recommend because it feels true and honest, and because it's refreshing<br/><br/>I didn't watch season 2, and i think i will not since the review are not as great as for season 1 The production, directing, acting was incredible-flawless. It's been a very long time since I've watched a series of any kind, where I was truly excited to get through the next week, to the next episode. So many thought provoking situations and hair raising wow moments, it's literally impossible to put a finger on just one single moment, comment, situation, symbolic meaning ... Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson were spot-on perfect. The director was masterful. True Detective is a 10/10 without question!<br/><br/>Oops, I forgot about second season ........ OUCH! True Detective = OUTSTANDING until ... season number 2. Season 1 amazed me in every way. Matthew McConaughey's performance was stunning and unlike any of his other work and the storyline was just so well written. 
Season 2 on the other hand...is garbage and I had to give up after 2 episodes. Watch season 1 and savor it, then skip season 2 and preserve your memory of True Detective as the gem that is was. I have just watched the first series of True Detective, having let it slip under my radar until now, and I was not disappointed!
I'll try not to put any spoilers in here but overall I felt the story was very good and interesting/twisted but it is the acting of McConaughey and Harrelson which really makes this great. The chemistry between the two is so good, I could just watch them two sitting in a car for an hour and find it thoroughly enjoyable. 
Back to the story, I felt like I lost the story a little bit, maybe half way through the series, lost track of what was going on a little, but that was probably due to the series focusing more on the main characters background, so when the invesitgation picked up momentum I wasn't 100% sure of how it got there but it was throughly enjoyable either way. 
The series has made me realise how good McConaughey is as an actor, so much so that I am now looking to binge through some of his movies!
Debating watching series 2, although heard mainly negative things so may give it a miss. I have seen only Season 1 as I have read very discouraging reviews about season 2 on this site. It was one of the most interesting series I have ever seen. The acting was marvelous; every person, every scene, every emotion came across to the viewer. Realistic characters, amazing dialogues, beautiful scenery. The best thing for me was that the show never became gory considering the nature of the crime. Disturbing? Yes. Disgusting? No.<br/><br/>The negatives for me were: 
Unnecessary nudity: Implied would have been more impactful rather than the in your face.
Rushed final episode: A lot of things which were built up throughout the series were not explained at the end.
The Ending: I had no problem regarding the 'suspense',i.e., the identity of the culprit. It followed the theme of the series, natural and possible. However, the last ten minutes were, atleast for me, difficult to digest.<br/><br/>All the same, I am sure it will prove to be an enjoyable series and will keep you hooked till the end. Season one is one of the best shows I have seen in a very long time. The characters are so very well developed and human. Their interactions are something you don't get tired of despite of watching several hours in one sitting. The storyline that spans through the whole season is brilliant. <br/><br/>Couldn't really keep watching after the actors changed and didn't find second seasons first few episodes as intelligent. Stopped watching. <br/><br/>So 10 stars for S1! This review is for (Season 1).I have to start by saying this was not amazing at all. I don't understand such the great reviews. The acting by both Woody & Matthew is brilliant, but the show moves at a pretty slow pace, this could be just my problem. Overall, the story is solid,but maybe not enough action to hold it together.It is something I've seen once now, all the way through and would not watch again. Overall a big let down for me, as I am a huge fan of both actors. Overall 6.5/10.Maybe 7 at a push. Season 2 was similar to 1 in that it was dark and brooding. The problem is that it was too dark. Very, very freaking depressing. I really enjoyed it until the final episode. I just finished it so maybe I'm too emotional, but what the f*** is the point. I binge watched it in a couple days, which is the best way to watch any series, so that made my connection to the characters even greater. Also, I just got through watching season 1 about a week before I saw season 2 so my expectations were high for season 2. Maybe if I were drunk for the whole thing I wouldn't have been bothered so much. If I knew it ended like this I wouldn't have watched it. Still, it was done very well. And since I guess this is a review of both season 1 and 2 ... 9 out of 10. The first season is just brilliant. It gives you everything you could desire from a movie like that: an interesting plot, drama, the best acting, deep philosophical thoughts of the main charismatic character and the most atmospheric series you have ever seen. If you want to be fascinated, watch "True Detective: Season 1". <br/><br/>The second season. Let's begin with that it's an another story, so don't hope for a sequel. It is very good too, but not as great as the first one in any aspect. If you like this genre, you won't be disappointed any way, so if you ask, whether you should watch it or no? It's a yes! Season 1 of this series was compelling and interesting. Season 2 is just awful. It is not even as good as mediocre detective series on network TV. Just putting in some gratuitous nudity and bad language does not make a good series or viewing experience. HBO get a clue! The Sopranos had way too much gratuitous nudity but overall, was an excellent series that would have been much improved without nude women in every episode. That inclusion was just degrading and completely unnecessary to make a great series. In fact, it would have been a much better series without it. Season 2 of True Detective takes a very thin story line and apparently, HBO thinks if they add in some nudity, etc. then they have a great season. This is just not true. WHAT I LIKED<br/><br/>1. In season 1, Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson gave great performances as Rust Cohle and Marty Hart, respectively. Colin Farrell (Ray Velcoro), Rachel McAdams (Ani Bezzerides) and Taylor Kitsch (Paul Woodrugh) also gave good performances in season 2.<br/><br/>2. In season 1, the story was interesting and all the characters were well-developed. Season 2 started well but towards the end it faltered.<br/><br/>3. The failed gang robbery and the meth lab shootout scenes in season 1 were great. Season 2 didn't have action scenes to match that level but the police shootout scene was great.<br/><br/>WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE<br/><br/>1. Way too long for one case (season 1). Season 2 had more characters to justify the case length but the ending wasn't satisfying.<br/><br/>TOP 5 EPISODES<br/><br/>1. Season 1, Episode 05 - The Secret Fate of All Life<br/><br/>2. Season 1, Episode 04 - Who Goes There<br/><br/>3. Season 1, Episode 06 - Haunted Houses<br/><br/>4. Season 1, Episode 08 - Form and Void<br/><br/>5. Season 2, Episode 04 - Down Will Come<br/><br/>VERDICT<br/><br/>The first season has lots of great moments but is ruined by the long runtime and slow pace. The second season is less convoluted and a more straight-forward fare but is ruined by its ending.<br/><br/>6/10 - Above average Purely based on the excellent actors and their skills I rate True Detective at seven stars. But that's just because the actors are really top notch. You can't fault any of them. Remarkable acting. But other then that this show is way too complicated to make it have a better score. And that's a pity. The amount of different characters make it difficult to watch. It's sometimes also a bit slow. I just finished the second season and the ending was disappointing. But for the rest you get a show with excellent filming, excellent sound and excellent actors. I don't get why they want to make it so complicated. Just simplify it a bit and you get one of the best series on television. If they would make a third season I will probably watch it. But to me they can just stop after those two seasons. There are way better shows then this one. One of the best shows i've watched.Definitely worth your time ! 1st season is superb the act and the story are ridiculously good and breathtaking. The show has this dark, eerie feel to it which I love. McConaughey and Harrelson deliver great performances. Do not watch if you aren't into complex plots. But otherwise, I strongly suggest giving this one a go.2nd season is not like the 1st season for me but the acting and the story was very good.I thought Vince Vaugnh cant act a serious role but i was wrong. He did a very good job in this season.The story in the 2nd season builds slow unlike in the 1st season,but every episode is quite good and worth to watch.The final 3 episodes from season 2 are so breathtaking. Just After I finished True Detective season two, I totally felt the very same heavy air of the last season and satisfied by the spirit of the gloominess just like the last season's ending. Actually the slow time coding of the script with exceptional long dialogues, the thrilling dark place using and a small quiet town (chosen just like in the first season) with low pulse, again seemed like the right choice for a thought-provoking based Crime Series.<br/><br/>The technical distinction between the two seasons firstly can be mentioned as the right choice of the good actors and actresses with their bad luck of being the successors of two great actors Matthew McCaughey and Woody Harrelson. The other important technical detail which is obvious is the gloominess of the script with long-time coded scenes takes place in a slow advancement maybe just a little bit more rapid than the season one despite having a huge complexity context if we set against it to the season one script. I found the most successful technical about the season two was the success of the director's processing the subject judiciously.There were more killings, massacres and intrigues etc. But, no need to hurry intelligence, in case of the scriptwriter and director cooperation, made a slow releasing effect on the audience's mind. And there is another fact that, all of the incidents that I observed season two was much more complex than the season one and it's not that easy for a director to put the whole script in a calm attitude processing just in 8 episodes, like the more articulate first season.<br/><br/>The Script's complexity made the difference and made the season two more script based on the contrary of the season one's amazing acting based progression.And so far, I believe that, season one's acting skills that have penetrated in our souls as we observed totally 2 different detectives' inner worlds with a realistic gaze, and the second season's coorparete and shared character attitudes for a cause like vigilantes, created a 2 piece masterpiece that should be watched together and completed each other.<br/><br/>And I have few words for the plot, the corruption idea and the government involvements in these corruptions especially in small towns or cities, gave the greatest message for the understanding of the new world dragging into the filth by the corrupted company owners, politics and heavyweight riches, even they live in a justice central superpower country. I applause the plot for being used in a major new production that has been shot fastidiously. *Possible spoilers ahead<br/><br/>Second part of a decent show is definitely different from the first part. Not as mind-game intensive, yet still convoluted with many details. Mainly writing this to express my delightful surprise, as far as Vaughn's character goes. He single-handedly delivers and pulls this show. Farrell, even though he's the official lead, trails behind Vaughn in character. I wasn't really buying his and his son's/ex-wife relationship. Just wasn't enough love there. Vaughn's and Reilly's relationship is enigmatic. Where these women at in real world, though? lol Both show strength and healthy conflict resolution techniques. Even in the ending scene, you want to believe that he will get out of that desert, and they will "live happily ever after." Maybe we'll see part tres, but doubting that. He's definitely not McConaughey of the first part. There is no eloquent dialogue, but he's a completely different character in a different setting. <br/><br/>Kitsch? Why was he there? Absolutely useless character that battles his closeted homosexuality and pops viagra to have hetero sex. Should've have taken him out when he shut his bike's lights and opened it up. Would've made for a bad-ass bike wreck scene. Flying over the guard-rail going 200mph? Bad-ass. Zero character, zero. I did feel a little sad when he got that bullet from behind. Sad that it took so long.<br/><br/>McAdams had some potential, but had a weak delivery of unresolved childhood issues and the rest of her character. She went from a bad-ass be to a soft-ass kitten once Farrell shaved that stache. Alright, overall 7/10. note: I reviewed this for the 1st season only<br/><br/>True detective is my 2nd fave detective TV series. Yes, True Detective is one of the gem show, but certainly it's not perfect. There is only 1 case per season in this show, which is a good thing for me.<br/><br/>This is a reason why it's not perfect. Even it only got 1 case for the entire 8 episodes, every time an episode ended I don't really have the urges to watch the next episode. It took me almost 2 weeks to watched all the 8 episodes. I think the investigation is bit long and slow sometimes. I rarely got the thrill except in episode 4 and the finale.<br/><br/>Well, let's talk bout the good stuff now: <br/><br/>1. Oscar winner actors as the duo detectives, great acting guaranteed<br/><br/>2. The story is great, realistic, dark, but it's little bit slow for me<br/><br/>3. The investigation feels real<br/><br/>4. The cinematography is good <br/><br/>5. The murderer is not the typical genius psycopath in other TV series <br/><br/>6. The escaping one shot scene in episode 4 is thrilling <br/><br/>7. Great finale, give me the chill <br/><br/>8. Well I think the sex scene in episode 2 is worth mentioning. Alexandra Dadario sex scene is mind blowing, Her body is just so dayum haha. Two Louisiana cops, family man Marty and loner Rust are thrown together and faced with unravelling the violent murder of a young woman which bears all the markings of an occult killing. <br/><br/>True Detective will invite you into a deeply unpleasant dark, dangerous and near- dystopian vision of the American South, with cinematography so eerily beautiful and hauntingly desolate that the State of Louisiana is almost like a third character in a similar way to David Lynch's Twin Peaks, whether this character is a protagonist or an antagonist is left intentionally ambiguous.<br/><br/>Gender is an overarching theme, in this world men are powerful yet morally incompetent, indifferent or unaware. Females are strongly depicted as background noise, victims, subordinates, prostitutes, strippers or beleaguered wives. In a memorable scene in an early episode a female sex worker passionately asserts that prostitution empowers the underage girl who works for her in a world that is inescapably misogynistic. In this terrible place, her rationale (even to me) seems perfectly reasonable and logical, because the world presented to the viewer is believable and the characters in it are authentic. Power and the misappropriation of it is also a notable thematic tool threaded through the show with varying degrees of prominence and menace.<br/><br/>Both Woody Harrelson (Marty) and Matthew Mconoughey (Rust) have been blessed with startlingly intelligent and finely written dialogue but what they do to it is something nothing short of mystical. Rust is a complex character indeed by his own admission, nihilistic and accepting that the world he is in is hopeless and that he is a doomed lost- soul, and a flawed and unfixable man. His portrayal of the certainty of Rust's acceptance that he and the world are largely pointless is something that will be remembered for many years to come. The character is not a misanthrope, nothing so simple as that rather he fears human contact and sees no purpose to it to the extent that he's not even comfortable in his own company much less that of others. Rust does not hide any of his flaws he accepts them and wears them like a badge of shame. His partner Marty is likewise complex. By contrast he seems adept at working the social and societal norms expected of him, but he is distinctly sociopathic ultimately morbidly selfish. Marty has convinced himself that because he sees horrific things and that his job is to deal with horrific things that this gives him carte blanche to do anything he needs to do to cope with it. This includes extra marital affairs, and treating both his wife and mistress terribly and at times violently. Strangely although these are two broken men in a broken world neither are unlikable because the relationship between them is what the viewer's focus will relentlessly dwell upon and obsess over.<br/><br/>Who is this series for? Well it's certainly not for everyone, let's be honest not everybody is going to enjoy this. True Detective is not a show which is pitched at the lowest common denominator, it's unapologetically philosophical. The highly educated viewer will understand the academic influences behind Rust's mindset. The less bookish can also appreciate the show as a murder mystery. <br/><br/>Either way this is adult only viewing that is destined to gain a cult rather than a mass following, not just because it deals with horrific events in a disturbing way but also because the nuances of the show are going to be lost on some viewers leaving them baffled and most likely bored. To sum it up if you love your entertainment edgy brave and compelling go for it because TV really doesn't get any better. Pizzolatto's detailed work of fiction will bring a whole new outlook to the TV crime genre, and keep you at the edge of your seat episode after episode. This series is a fresh style of crime drama that is truly gripping - and is far from your typical 'who dunnit' series. There are no true spoilers in this review, just a basic outline you will understand from the off. Please do read the review, I seldom do them, and if there has ever been a series where it is warranted, you have found it.<br/><br/>The first episode starts with dramatic Louisiana cinematography and brilliant narrative (done in an unusual fashion) that builds the series into what can only be described as the closet thing to a crime novel you can get on the screen. But fear not, it is not compiled with complex dialogue and tedious context. Pizzolatto's portrayal of Louisiana's State Police murder unit feels complete from start to finish, and gives a deep sense of reality throughout the series. McConaughey's performance as Rustin Cohle is second to none, and the character portrayal he provides allows the viewer to enter the mind (however briefly and complex) of an otherwise unreadable character. Harrelson's performance as Martin Hart is likewise incredible, providing a direct antithesis to Cohle, the two complement each other on the screen and work in a fitting, likable way. Supporting acts are also excellent and the whole direction and production truly make you believe you are there, side by side, with the two Detectives, experiencing the raw images they are exposed to and working the case with them.<br/><br/>The series starts at a relatively slow pace and the script and narrative add layers to the masterpiece as the episode intensity increases, and the characters begin to unfold. Pizzolatto's direction takes the viewer on a journey through 90's Louisiana, into the world of occult murders and Police power, where nothing is quite as it seems. His interview style narrative allows the viewer to question the 'inbetweens' and provides are more in depth feel to add to the growing reality you get as you progress through the initial episodes. Integrated story lines, exceptional acting and an all round seamless plot provide you with one of the greatest crime television series I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Thrilling, edgy, enticing and pensive - a must watch for all adults. Give it time, and follow the initial dialogue, and by episode 2 you'll be at the edge of your seat desperate to find out what happens next. 10/10 This was a very good TV series because it kept you on your edge of your seat which is really cool in my opinion. The actors that were chosen for the movie were good picks because they really got into their character which is good. The setting of it was really cool Because it looked very mysterious which was pretty much how the whole series was. Whenever he would go on his adventure to check on the mystery it would be very interesting because the viewers didn't know what was gonna happen, anything could have happened it was like an open book. The best episode of the series was the last episode because it was so action packed. Especially when they were going through the tunnels that were made was very creepy. The best part of the last episode was when they were fighting with the other guy because it made it seem like the other guy was going to win but he didn't. That is what most movies and TV series do. What I love about this series is not lonely is it great but its a perfect length! Not too long and you get some resolution and satisfactory ending (unlike Lost, Heroes, etc etc which drag out series until they get ridiculous and you realise you've wasted months of your life and never find out anything). What is also great is knowing the finish line is in site - I watched the last 4 episodes back to back as couldn't wait for it to finish. The juxtaposition of the 2 characters is fantastic - one flawed family man and one weirdo loner but with a strong moral compass (of sorts). For fans of dark, broody drama you can't beat this! This is probably my favourite piece of TV in the last five years. I love the first season so much I'm afraid to watch the second. True Detective is simply magnificent binge-watching, with excellent acting, writing and direction, subtle, fast, clever, sad, horrible, addictive, funny, perfect. Maybe I should just stop this review here.<br/><br/>True Detective is not comfort crimewatch. The characters are as appalling as they are magnetic; being trapped in a car with Rustin Cohle as he pontificates about the futility of existence while Marty Hart swaggers around trying to be the only bull on the ranch, could make Chief Wiggum look like a viable dinner date. There's no 'Book 'em Danno,' moment, no sense that the good will always win through, though the very last moments of the series are radiant in optimism, welcome stars shining in the dark.<br/><br/>One complaint I have heard is that, with its nod to the Lovecraftian mythos, there has been some disappointment that this is not a supernatural horror story.<br/><br/>This is about something darker than a special effect (if that's what you want, no problem, but you really won't find it here) Marty Hart destroying his family in his fight against time, Rustin Cohle destroying himself as he cuts little tin men out of endless beer cans, betrayal and addiction, ruin and loneliness, questions that don't get answered, and yet must be; and when the answers are wrong, they have to try again. That's what makes them true detectives, even if it takes them years.<br/><br/>We don't know what will define future mysteries. One of my favourite shots in the series displays the sun and its reflection in water; in the mythos, the place of twin suns is Carcosa, city of the yellow king, a place or state of madness. We just don't realise we're living in it. Evil doesn't leap at us out of the unknown, it's mowing our lawns and painting our houses, it lives right nearby. And just when we think we know the territory, we find we're far from any road.
