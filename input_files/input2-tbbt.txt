I thoroughly enjoyed seasons 1 to 5 with some of the most intellectually-stimulating and subtle humour since Seinfeld. Like physicist Sheldon "embracing the chaos" or using classical conditioning techniques on his roommate's girlfriend. But you did need a modicum of (popular) science knowledge to get the jokes, so apparently by season 6 they rolled out the usual array of mindless comedy writers to turn it into a yawn-worthy series of relationship clichés and rake in more viewers. When binge-watching it, you also notice disturbing patterns like the demeaning portrayals of both the men and women scientists, for different reasons. Grew up around researchers and no, they were not men-children who spent their time at the comic book store. Actually at my Dad's university they were pretty much all stable family types with successful careers, and there were a few loners, too. Like pretty much any group of humans. Lest people think this review is unfair, I have seen all seasons, hoping for a return to the cleverness of seasons 1-5 but alas it shall not be. This is one series that unfortunately will not go out with a Big Bang, but with a fizzle. From about season 1-3 of this show, I genuinely loved it! I got a lot of good laughs, and it is definitely pleasing for the geeks and nerds out there of all kinds! And then the show did something it really shouldn't... add more relationships, and focus on them.<br/><br/>From Howard and Bernadette to Sheldon and Amy and so on and so forth, the show just started to become more irritating and less tolerable. Yes Leonard and Penny had relationship problems in the early seasons, but I never liked that anyway. Now it's like they have tripled that problem with adding more couples we don't care about and constantly groan about... Well, at least I do anyway. <br/><br/>Sure the new seasons still have those rare gems every once in a while, but for the most part, it's just seeing episodes with at least ONE of the characters having girlfriend problems while their girlfriends are mostly bitches. That is not what made Big Bang theory great! Now it feels like every other sitcom out there, only with a bunch of nerds.<br/><br/>So, I highly recommend the old seasons and even some of the newer ones, but overall, it's just losing it's edge. <br/><br/>5.5/10 What this review might have sounded like had I written it 7 years ago. <br/><br/>The first few seasons are, for the most part, extremely fantastic, focused, funny, fresh, intelligent and even at times, brilliant...Must see TV!<br/><br/>What this review sounds like now nearing the end of the shows run. <br/><br/>A once great show which slowly starts to diminish around season 4, unfortunately. By the 9th season it seems as though the pen and paper have been handed over to teenage fans of the show...Decent background noise. <br/><br/>To conclude. <br/><br/>This show was once incredible, and something fresh, even at times brilliant. I couldn't wait for each new episode. Now, I watch it when it becomes available on a streaming service, and, on rare occasion you get a great episode, but it's not worth devoting a weekly schedule and sitting through all the fan-fiction episodes and story lines to get to the good stuff. The show can still be enjoyable, without question, though I find it better suited as background noise while doing work instead of must see TV that you're excited to tune in as it airs each week. The scientific jokes and the humor were great. This is the only sitcom I have seen after FRIENDS. It feels good to see Sheldon, a feeling less person to develop feelings, Leonard and Howard getting married when before they couldn't find girls, Sheldon getting married with Amy, Raj getting over his ability not to speak with women. Amazing show. The show has evolved over the course of 12 years, although there were some low falls. When my boyfriend tuned into the premiere I thought the show was going to be stupid. I was so surprised. This is the first TV show to really showcase nerds with pretty much dead on accuracy. This has a sparkling cast (Jim Parsons is the new and improved David Hyde Pierce) and fantastic humor that ranges from light slapstick to seriously quick wit. This show is a great love letter to nerds, and as such any nerd should give this a try. With a bunch of new (and very lame) shows debuting, it's good to see something worth watching! This premise isn't exactly new but the execution is nothing short of brilliant. Give it a shot!! I found the show to be very funny. The laugh track needs to go though. I was afraid that the girl would be portrayed as a really stereotypical dumb blonde. I was glad to see that she is not. Granted she isn't a nerd genius like the rest of the characters, but she is just your average person. There is a lot of subtle humor mixed in with the obvious jokes. Good show and I hope it lasts as there are very few comedies on Television now that can actually make me laugh.<br/><br/>Before 100 people insult my taste, humor is subjective. If you can identify with the subject matter, it is funny to you. If you can't, it isn't. Having worked in Information Technology for over 25 years, I can see a lot of myself and my friends in Sheldon and Leonard.<br/><br/>By the way, if you are my age, you may get the nod to one of the greats of TV comedy in the lead characters first names. I have seen a few episodes of the new CBS sitcom The Big Bang Theory and to me it's one of the best written sitcoms currently on network TV. The scripts are filled with scientific references some people might not understand but they are very witty. Johnny Galecki and Jim Parsons are definitely one of TV's newest comedy teams who have great chemistry and the addition of Kaley Cuoco as their neighbor, Penny brightens up the show. Let's not overlook the supporting cast with Simon Helberg as Wolowitz, who looks a little like Paul Reubens, the man behind Pee-Wee Herman and Kunal Nayyar as their friend from India. <br/><br/>If you watch the closing credits closely, you'll notice that there's a credit saying "Science Consultant." It's the first sitcom to employ one. It was a very good idea by the show's creator Chuck Lorre, who also is behind the CBS hit Two and a Half Men to hire one to bring scientific honesty into the show. <br/><br/>I hope The Big Bang Theory is around for several years. It has a solid future. Wow.. from my absolute favorite, this show has slowly turned into a sad, sad sight.. I get it: you can write only so many nerd jokes, and you can keep the show funny only for so long, but will you guys please put the BBT out of its misery already?<br/><br/>First three or four seasons: Solid gold; funny, good plot lines. The last couple of seasons: weak, thin stories. Writers are definitely showing every sign of fatigue. <br/><br/>This is turning into less-funny Friends with a slight nerdy slant. Please end this with whatever dignity there is left, and don't let it deteriorate any further. I just love this show! If you can appreciate great writing and great acting than this show is for you.<br/><br/>My favorite episode is "The Big Bran Hypothesis". That was hilarious. I hadn't laughed like that in a long time. When Leonard came out of his room in his underwear armed with a light-saber, I thought I was going to hurt myself I was laughing so hard. And the whole "sarcasm" bit was perfect comedy genius. And it's not just that the comedy is written so well - - the timing is dead on! The actors are truly artists.<br/><br/>Bravo CBS! I'm hooked and will keep watching!<br/><br/>And if anyone reading hasn't seen the show yet, check it out! Guys, other than what I have read about Season 10, I personally would like to thank everybody involved to let the characters grow and become more real in their own little Big Bang Universe while all the while they are still so funny. Keep up the good work with the continuous development of the Sheldon and Amy relationship. In many ways they have a lot more than most people do in real life. I can't wait to see Season 11. Stick to the good quality. This show was pure gold at first when it was just penny and the boys: when Sheldon was never open to the possibility of a relationship because of his social awkwardness and inability to understand people, when Raj couldn't speak with a girl around, and a hot girl moves in. It was genius and hilarious. The introduction of Bernadette and Amy ruined this show. Their characters are awful and intensely annoying and unfunny. Their introduction also ruined other character's story lines. Sheldon never would've ended up dating a girl the way they wrote him in with Amy. Howard was perfect when he was the overly horny nerd, and him marrying and settling down with Bernadette ruined his character. They couldn't figure out how to keep Raj the silent character so they made him talk to girls and even date as well. Which was pathetic writing. Making Penny fit in with all of them ended up removing the hot, dumb blonde girl around nerds effect that made the show great to begin with. Now, Penny doesn't stand out as the hot girl against the nerds because they stopped writing her like that and just made it more like Friends instead of the clashing personalities dynamic that made this show good. The first three seasons of this show are the worth to watch. In fact, this show ratings and success is based upon these three seasons. These seasons are mainly about comedy with little to none emotions. But as the show progresses and Leonard, Sheldon and Howard finds their life partners, whole tune of this show changes. You'll find romance, love and emotions with some dose of comedy after that. I think at this point, this show loses its main theme. I am rating it 5 only because of the first three seasons. The quality of show will start to decline gradually after season 3. But i think it shows good depiction of scientists. I also have some scientist friends who have many similarities with the characters of this show. There aren't many shows that you can watch over and over and still laugh, but this is one of them. Every actor plays their character to perfection, and the writing is great. I will be really sad when it ends. I just hope Netflix picks it up so I can binge watch start to finish. I tried to like "The Big Bang Theory". I really tried. However, after seeing a couple of episodes from this sitcom, I ended hating everything about it.<br/><br/>For me, the biggest problem from "The Big Bang Theory" (Besides of the unfunny jokes and the awful cultural references) were the characters. All of them were incredibly unlikeable and annoying (even those that the viewers are supposed to sympathize) unsurprisingly, those characters are also clichés, perpetuating the stereotypical characterization of the "nerd" archetype as seen in many, many other movies and television shows, since the film "Revenge of the Nerds".<br/><br/>All the references made in this show are not only bland, shallow and forced, but also painfully unfunny as well. To get things worse, that stupid laugh track made all those so-called jokes even more irritating, as it were constant reminders to the viewers of what they are supposed to be laughing at.<br/><br/>I consider "The Big Bang Theory " to be a strongly mediocre series with overused stereotypes and flat jokes. For me, this show was like the live-action equivalent of one those lame and unfunny gaming web comics which try to be "cool" and "edgy" by including misogyny and lots of random (and also utterly pointless) nerd references.<br/><br/>So, in other words, "The Big Bang Theory" is the (stereotypically) nerd version of "Friends". Is this what comedy for smart people is supposed to be? I found nothing in anything they say that is even even slightly funny. I am a geeky physics student myself, yet, I have nothing in common with any of the characters or the things they say. Many of the jokes, and I use the term 'joke' loosely, may be smart but completely lacking in humour.<br/><br/>The main character Sheldon is simply rude and offensive and I personally would slap his face if he spoke to me the way he speaks to others. He is just annoying. Is this the big joke I am missing? Is his rude and ignorant behaviour supposed to be funny? <br/><br/>Maybe it's just me, but I don't get this show. It is boring. Definitely slated to be the best sitcom of this season, this is a creative and funny show. Two geeks have a beautiful girl (Penny) move to the apartment next door. The two geeks have two friends that are even geekier. Here is the many ways in which this show excels: the geeks are lovable and funny and human, not pathetic, you feel for them, the neighbor girl is a very sweet girl, and for once the characters are educated and thoughtful, not the usual "dumb" people we see on TV. The dynamics and the dialog between the four friends is fast paced, funny and rich with detailed observations. This is a comedy by Chuck Lorre, the guy who has created Dharma (from Dharma & Greg) so I am fully expecting Penny's character to bloom into far more than what meets the eye. The four male leads establish their personalities in the pilot with such ease that it's clear we are watching a very well written and well acted show. Kudos to the whole cast and the writers. I hope this funny, smart show stays around. We need a comedy with wit and heart, and for a change - lovable geeky brains too. This started as a brilliant show about five single young adults: four nerdy male scientists and a slutty, uneducated waitress. This worked really well. However, the makers decided to ruin this unique and very entertaining formula and put all its main characters - apart from Raj - in long-term relationships. By doing that, they've turned a great new show into yet another mediocre, couples and families sitcom.<br/><br/>Bernadette is an intensely annoying, condescending, manipulative, patronising, bullying, arrogant battleaxe who falsely claims to be nice. She has ruined the humour that involves Howard by changing him from a desperate single guy trying to get laid into hen-pecked, downtrodden property of hers. She's like one bad joke repeated over and over again. She snipes at Howard frequently, despite knowing full well what he was like before they married. Melissa Rauch doesn't have Bernadette's horrible voice, so I don't know why she puts on such a painfully unpleasant voice to play her. <br/><br/>Amy's like a female version of Sheldon and hence is redundant.<br/><br/>Leonard and Penny aren't anywhere near as funny as a couple compared to how they were when they were both single.<br/><br/>I'd give this 9 before Bernadette was introduced and 3 afterwards. There are a lot more episodes that include her than don't - hence I've given it 5. I didn't expect much from this show at the beginning of this season, but I have been pleasantly surprised. It has actually become my favorite show this year.<br/><br/>Now, with only one new episode left this season I will miss it over the summer and hope to see it back next year (PLEASE CBS!!!). <br/><br/>There are so many aspects of the show I like. First, I love how various aspects of the nerds relate to the folks I know (mostly in IT). Second, I love how the show flirts with the stereotypes, such as the dumb blond, but doesn't quite go there. Penny is not dumb, and Raj can be quite social if the circumstances are right. The blending of intellectual and ridiculous is also very well done, so that neither is overwhelming.<br/><br/>Keep it up, and keep this on TV! After hearing all my (former) friends rant and rave about this "smart, edgy, hilarious comedy" that I just NEEDED to check out, I decided to give this show a try. Note that this is shortly after marathon-ing through some great TV shows like Breaking Bad which is actually a smart show. Anyway, 10 minutes into the first episode I was bored out of my skull with the already repetitive and awkward humour. But, I knew that 10 minutes of one episode was not enough to judge a show by. So I watched the 1st season and a half and I can say not once through those 25 episodes did I even come close to cracking anything that even slightly resembled half a smile. It is the same sitcom show we've seen for the past 40 years disguised as a quirky show filled with intelligent characters. I've read a lot of the other reviews on here and a lot of them agree with the statement that this is not a quirky or even slightly smart show. The demographic it appeals to are brain-dead teenagers who think that when the extremely unfunny Jim Parsons says a few big words, it is the most hilarious thing there has ever been. Strip away the incredibly simple Star Wars references and the mumbled soliloquies of Parsons and what's revealed is a below average sitcom decades behind its time filled with unlikable characters. It baffles me how people can enjoy a single episode of this nonsense, never mind call it a "masterpiece". Use the term "comedy" very loosely when describing this trash. I used to be a huge Big Bang Theory fan for the first three seasons,but after the 4th season I just think the whole series has become a repetition of the same nerd jokes and false stereotypes.The addition of Amy and Sarah has made it even worse;Howard is no longer a funny d- bag(which I loved him for);Sheldon treats Amy like a computer program and Leonard gets Penny,and now they BOTH suck.<br/><br/>Chuck Lorre is making the same mistake he did with Two And A Half Men;I've now vowed to myself that I'd never watch any of his sitcoms again.There are way better shows out there(like How I Met Your Mother or Friends or Modern Family) but people still defend this show and it's pointless plot as if this was a remake of Citizen Kane. What can be said about a supposed comedy where one of the lead characters has to be explained as having a form of autism to explain why he's so offensively annoying? <br/><br/>That it should never have been green-lighted to begin with.<br/><br/>Big Bang Theory is possibly the least funny series to be passed off as a comedy since My Mother, the Car. The character of Leonard is actually tolerable, but Sheldon is repulsive! His sarcasm, rudeness and general nastiness is enough to make a viewer want to do him serious bodily harm. The cute blonde is eye candy to make the scenes with the dweebs tolerable, but other than that, this series is stultifyingly unfunny. The 2 AM test pattern on a Detroit public access channel has more entertainment value than The Big Bang Theory. Last year my friend just couldn't stop talking about how hilarious and funny this was. Even some of my teachers had said good things about it. My friend showed me two episodes on his laptop and said, " If you don't think this is funny, I don't know what it". Through the entire hour I laughed as many times as you've spoken while reading this review,zero. It still amazes me that hilarious shows such as Arrested Development get cancelled and this stays on air. For those who say this is " Smart Comedy" how is this funny when every funny thing in this show is easy for even the most idiotic people to understand. Than in Arrested Development you can watch episodes over and over again and still find new bits of comedy that you hadn't seen before. Than back to this show where people claim the funniest thing is Sheldon dressed like a zebra making weird noises. What's so smart about that?<br/><br/>The worst thing about this show is the Laugh Track. Now I don't mind laugh tracks if the show is funny but the laugh track just pops up at random places. A character will say something like, " I want to be a robot." Than the laugh track kicks off, sounding like they just heard the funniest thing in the world. The whole series are based on socially awkward nerds who meet a normal girl and they try uselessly to fit in with society. How can an entire 5 seasons be focused on that? One person commented saying in 5 minutes of Arrested Development they get more laughs than they get in a season of Big Bang. I disagree, I think in 5 minutes of Arrested Development I get more laughs than I get in the entire series. Being a physicists, I'm unsure of what to think of this show; however, the chemistry between the "nerds" is terrific! It is great to turn on a show that helps bring me back down to earth. The show may be a tiny bit unrealistic when it comes to how "nerds" actually behave, but you don't have to be a nerd to appreciate the science humor. In the same respect, the behavior of the "regulars" is a little exaggerated, but is done in such a way which helps accentuate the characters' contrast.<br/><br/>So what is to lose from watching this show? <br/><br/>You WILL be laughing by the end!<br/><br/>(The End) This show is definitely one of my guilty pleasures! Tuesdays are spent anxiously awaiting its posting on iTunes so I can download it, as I live in Canada & don't have cable. TBBT is a trip down memory lane for me, as it IS my high school experience (20+ years ago, I was a smarter Penny). I love the characters, especially Leonard who is adorable, and the smarmy yet surprisingly charming Wolowitz. It has the feel of "Frasier Goes To College". I do agree though that they should lose the laugh track - annoying, but not enough to make me stop watching. BTW, very smart of CBS to originally have offered the pilot as a free download or I would never have given it a look. Now I'm an addict! "The Big Bang Theory" started off as a fresh, intelligent and genuinely funny t.v. series that hit its peak during season 3. Every episode had a clear plot that involved one or more of the five central characters that had relevant jokes throughout; as well as many irrelevant to the plot but relevant to the overall theme. <br/><br/>During season five, however, the show started to change as it gained popularity. Instead of a fresh, intelligent show; it became the same "relationship therapy" show that has been regurgitated on E4 for years. Now, a once funny and insightful comedy that gave nerds the spotlight is a dull, familiar and used programme that recycles the same jokes and situations every few episodes.<br/><br/>For those of you who believe that TBBT is as good as it ever was, I ask you to watch an episode from seasons 1-4 such as:"The Pancake Batter Anomaly" or "The Tangerine Factor" from season 1; "The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis" from season 2 or any episode from seasons 3 and 4 then compare it to an episode from the other seasons. You will find a tremendous difference in plot and character quality.<br/><br/>I am deeply saddened that the once brilliant t.v. programme "The Big Bang Theory" has been sold out. My advice to anyone who has not yet watched it is to stop after season 4 as the later seasons will only sour your taste after an incredible time of watching the first four. The network that produced such classic sitcoms in the past as "All in the Family" and "The Munsters" does it again with "The Big Bang Theory," a tremendous success for Chuck Lorre following his drastic failure with "Dharma & Greg".<br/><br/>"BBT" follows the witty and sarcasm-soaked misadventures of Leonard and Sheldon, two socially awkward scientists thrust full-force into standard sitcom story lines-- themes of rejection, friendship, and pride, among others. The important thing is, the standard sitcom story lines feel new for the first time in decades, mainly because the mile-a-minute dialogue now comes with gloriously incomprehensible techno-babble and high-level jargon that could send Kissinger screaming from a room.<br/><br/>It comes down to essentially this. Spot-on writers and directors handle a spot-on cast in spot-on situations. Those of you who are turned off of shows by audience laughter, it adds a much-needed level of reality to this surreally present crowd-pleaser. And when the Writers' Strike ends (still happening as this is being written), fans of great comedy should look forward to much more from this high-potential hit.<br/><br/>Because it all started with the Big Bang. I love this show and think it's one of the best new shows on television. It expands upon the "boy meets girl" theme. The show features a bunch of ultra-geeky physicists who share an apartment. They are brilliant in the laboratory but totally inept outside of it. In moves gorgeous girl Penny across the hall, and she starts showing them what "real life" is all about. I think everything about this show is first-rate, from the writing and performances to the final cut. I hope this one stays around for a while. It certainly has potential. It is worth it just to watch Kaley Cuoco in it. She acts as good as she looks in it.<br/><br/>*** out of **** I'm probably in the minority when I say this show is boring. After watching a few episodes of this show, I can attest that it is one of the most terrible sitcoms I have ever seen. It is basically forced comedy with unremarkable jokes, boring stories, and goofy characters.<br/><br/>I haven't watched many sitcoms since the late 1990s, but this show reminded me why I stayed away from them. Unoriginal and uninspiring stories with no substance and with forced humor basically describe most of the TV sitcoms Hollywood dishes out today. I've seen better shows canceled after only one or two seasons. I'm sorry to any fans out there, but I think this one's gotta go. I'm sure there are better writers and actors who could give us more entertaining stuff than this.<br/><br/>Grade F There aren't many shows that you can watch over and over and still laugh, but this is one of them. Every actor plays their character to perfection, and the writing is great. I will be really sad when it ends. I just hope Netflix would pick it up so I could binge watch start to finish. I have no idea why people like this show so much, or think it's funny at all. Every time someone has it on, I cringe at how horribly "set up a one liner, deliver a punch line, play a laugh track" the jokes are. The humor is like something my grandparents would find funny. Oh, geeks/dorks are funny, that's so funny! Not really. The characters are trite and lame, and the jokes just aren't funny. A great show for people with no sense of humor or a sophisticated sense of comedy, who are easily amused by 4th grade giggles. IMDb tells me i need to write more here, but i can't even think of anything else to say about this show. There are so many funnier and better-written comedies that have come and gone over the years. I hope this show is long forgotten as soon as it goes off the air. It is a 1 compared to master comedies like Seinfeld, Friends, Frasier, Night Court, All in the Family, Family Ties, or any other 100's of way better shows that have come and gone over the years. I still laugh way harder watching 1 re-run of Night Court from the 1980's than I ever have at a single joke in this show. I haven't been watching bbt for a season and seeing how this good this start to the season was I question myself as to why I quit watching ever I was welcomed back with open arms and the funniest episode I have seen in awhile now while I really hope this season doesn't screw up but its a terrific and solid start and can only hope it gets better so worth watching This sitcom is not amusing. It is anything but. The plot is cliché-full, the characters one-dimensional, you can see a joke or a punchline coming from a mile away, the laugh track is annoying and overall, it has all the appearance of hundreds of sitcoms we have seen and suffered through since time immemorial.<br/><br/>As to the scientific value of this show, the fact that it has a scientific consultant does not turn it into a science program. Blurting a few correct scientific facts once in a while can be done by anyone with the ability to read Wikipedia articles.<br/><br/>The only redeeming feature is the heroine's décolleté, but that is just a sexist observation, I know, so I'll amend it to "there are no redeeming features to this show". It's The Simpsons Syndrome all over again: a show that was great in the earlier seasons (in this case, primarily Season 1-3, which I rate as among the greatest put to television), entered a steady decline, and then jumped the shark. It's no great mystery; money has once again corrupted something good.<br/><br/>Like with the Simpsons, the show started off with a very solid base and great writing. It had to be well written in order for it to succeed. But as soon as it became a hit, the problems started. The first thing that happened was multiple guest appearances, largely for no practical or logical in-show reason (The Simpsons ring a bell?), which was then followed by changes in the writing to reach out to as many people as possible—demographics. You see, as soon as a show, or computer game franchise, or ANYTHING becomes famous enough, it can start branching out to more people in pursuit of more money. To do this, things have to change and, usually, these changes are for the worse. Greed gets in the way nearly every time. <br/><br/>In the case of TBBT, the changes were mainly designed to attract more female viewers.<br/><br/>The show's primary audience was originally sci-fi fans and technically minded people interested in science. News flash: that generally is not women. The show was funny because it had interactions between three desperate geeks, a genius with serious social problems, and their total opposite— a gorgeous female neighbour named Penny, who works at the Cheesecake Factory. A lot of people, male and female, enjoyed this dynamic, and there was a cleverness to the writing throughout. People more 'nerd' (a stupid word that insinuates being intelligent is a bad thing) oriented could understand the clever science references, as well.<br/><br/>That's all gone now. Beginning mainly Season 4 (although there were some silly individual moments beforehand), the show swamped the audience with brain-dead relationship story-lines, which a lot of women, sadly, find appealing. Also, dumb and relentless sexual references became the norm (in one scene, I kid you not, a main character goes to the bathroom to 'use her toothbrush'). 'Friends'-type crap is not what made TBBT great, but the writers don't care anymore. They want more money (and that includes the greedy cast. Look it up!). Sadly, like with The Simpsons, the show had no ending in mind when it started. There was no plan. Instead of a show that lasts a few seasons and has a respectable ending, we've got The Simpsons again—a show that just keeps on going, with no goal in sight, and with increasingly inferior writing to boot. I gave up with TBBT at the start of Season 9. Up until then, it was at least watchable. Now it's crossed over into insulting. The characters aren't even behaving remotely like they were in the first seasons, and the writers are waving a magic wand whenever they feel like it; for example, two of the main characters go from menial jobs to massive success in a very short period of time. But it doesn't matter, see. For every intelligent person that drops out, two status-quo loving, unimaginable dumb-asses have already taken their place.<br/><br/>This pattern happens an awful lot; there is nothing you can do except vote with your feet and watch the earlier seasons instead. It's sad that the characters were not done justice, all through the want of money instead of art. The show has become lazy, thick, and, even worse, predictable. It's over. I gave it chance watching first three seasons and it only confirmed my first impression, being a train wreck.<br/><br/>Nerds in popular culture are known for StarTrek mostly, and they were somewhat used in movies/TV shows as a comedic relief. Somebody came to a question "How many nerd TV shows did we had?", answer was clear, none.<br/><br/>In the world where twitter and Facebook represent social life of the world, not just people who created it (colloquially named nerds) its now acceptable to have such a show. For me this is an insult produced by the marketing management of the studio/TV station.<br/><br/>If you want to watch a truly funny TV show you would see The IT Crowd, a great British comedy, written and directed as to really show the "nerds" not as a naive, stupid, limited and socially crippled, but as people devoted to their work.<br/><br/>TBBT is created without simple sitcom humor so it brings little to the screens.<br/><br/>I am so sorry for the people who didn't had an opportunity to watch a real sitcom like Frasier or real TV show like NYPD Blue, which in their time really gave people something to watch, not just entertaining their brain with dumb blonds and fast-paced exchange of scientific words supported by crispy nice eye candy of sets and shots.<br/><br/>Character of Leonard is so appalling and moronically-conniving that the character of Penny is truly his mate.<br/><br/>Only one, that is ever worth of this show and screen time is Sheldon.<br/><br/>Rating of 8.7/10 gives no input on the quality of the true sense of the show. I am so disappointed by the TV production in last 11 years that I cant find anything truly worth watching today.<br/><br/>Frak Michel Bay, frak JJ Abrams, frak Leonard (TBBT). This show is brilliantly written, has a fantastic cast, keeps you laughing from start to finish of every episode, and shows that even particle physics can be funny. For some of you who may not have seen The Big Bang Factor yet it is a lot like Scrubs if you crank up the geek factor and move the characters from a hospital to a laboratory.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what CBS is doing to promote this series but clearly it is not enough. I heard about this show through a friend and I have never seen a commercial for it ever. I don't know if CBS is trying to keep this show a secret or if their marketing guys just fell asleep at the wheel but this show is fantastic.<br/><br/>The characters, that seem exaggerated at first, are actually believable if you have ever been to a physics conference of any kindor for that matter any comic-con. These "geeks" make up an ever growing segment of our population and I think it is wonderful that they finally have a show to call their own. Perhaps I am biased because of my own nerd tendencies but I have had arguments exactly like the ones in this show with my own clique of nerdy friends. To anyone who ever enjoyed math class watch this show and get your friends who didn't like math class to watch too because if they get you they will get this show. Recently I attempted to watch an episode of this show, however I honestly couldn't even get to the ten minute mark. It was the most contrived and uninteresting thing I have ever attempted to endure. Every single line, no matter how mundane and innocuous, was greeted with a pause in acting so they could fill in the clearly recorded canned laugh track.<br/><br/>It was really quite painful.<br/><br/>'Hello'... pause... (laugh track) 'What are you doing?'... pause... (laugh track) 'I'm looking in the fridge'... pause... (laugh track)<br/><br/>And so on and so on, until you just want to kill yourself.<br/><br/>Despite all the spoon fed laugh track cues there are literally no real laughs to be had anywhere. Normally with a show this banal one can usually elicit a laugh by laughing AT the people who like it, however, in all honesty, I just feel bad for them. And it's not even pity, I feel embarrassed for them The big bang theory is as much a comedy as Schindler's List.<br/><br/>I don't know why but I think Chuck Lorre has a personal vandetta against the comedy genre. Two and a half men was not funny and this is no different This is a show that always seems to be on the TV in my house when nobody is watching it. I decided to sit down and watch an episode last night.<br/><br/>I lasted 10 mins. It seems to be a "comedy" about 4 young men who are very smart and socially awkward. The writers have attempted to make them sound smart by adding lengthy lines about science or physics etc that have little or no relevance to the brain numbing "punchline" that follows.<br/><br/>If you are like me and enjoy smart comedy that you can rewatch time and time again like IASIP, Arrested Development, Curb Your Enthusiasm etc then this is not for you.<br/><br/>On the other hand if you enjoy a TV programme that makes your head feel like it has been in a microwave for 21 mins then you will enjoy.<br/><br/>I would avoid this show like the plague.<br/><br/>I wish I could have rated it 0/10 Several people suggested I watch this series, so I saw three episodes. As I watched each one, wondering when I was supposed to laugh at its lame humor, my jaw began to drop more and more as the moments passed. My thoughts were: "are you scriptwriters kidding me?" These people are physicists. Being a physicist reaps some of the best and highest incomes among all the scientific fields, as soon as they finish college, and these so-called physicists share cramped, messy and impoverished looking quarters with other physicists?" Does anyone actually believe such a thing is even remotely realistic? I can tell you, the answer is no.<br/><br/>I am a scientist myself (not a physicist) and the stereotypical nerd characters in this series do not think, talk or live like any scientist I have ever met or worked closely with. 100 per cent of my colleagues have meaningful personal relationships and normal homes where yes, a good many of them raise families. Most participate in sports.<br/><br/>Not only is The Big Bang Theory not entertaining, I find it harmful in its potential to discourage some young people from pursuing science and math careers. If a young person is influenced into believing that these are typical scientists and they are sharing tiny and inferior looking domiciles with other scientists and having difficulties in sustaining relationships with other adults, are the young people going to think that being a scientist is a good choice for a career? After all, the TV says scientists are poor and weird. If there are no real scientists in these children's' lives to show them that the sitcom is pure fiction, the young viewers might actually believe the show. Which is saying something but for this trainwreck it's well deserved. The casting is awful but what kills this show is the writing, and more importantly, the character development. The characters would be annoying if the show was funny but with this drivel the annoyance is unbearable. With all the accolades the show has received I've tried on several occasions to watch and grasp at anything that would make me want to watch it again and it's been an epic fail. Minute after minute of laugh tracks for lines that have absolutely zero comedic value. It's sad when a show this bad gets such credit for being good. When it so clearly is not. ... Answer is a solid No. I have tried here and again to watch a full episode, but after 1 minute and 10 canned laughters, i give up. If I were a nerdy teen, and never had watched decent comedy, even then I wouldn't watch this (beep). It's cheap, brainless, aimed at the brainless course. I just watched a bit of one random episode tonight, and I couldn't spare a smile, it rather struck me as depressing, for the poorness in script, characters, actors, basically everything. If you think (scene from said episode) winking to your friend, and the friend winks back, and then a third wink provokes such huge laughter (canned, of course), be my guest, and watch this piece of garbage. And the winks were about something that wasn't funny in the first place. So in 30 seconds you have 4 barrelled laughters for nothing... And it goes on and on and on, for 7 seasons. Ridiculous... Formulaic comedy involving normal woman + geeks who are (a) so immersed in geekdom as to be blind to her purported charms or (b) sex-starved and desperate to get laid. Ha. Ha. Also, note: this is not a "smart comedy" just because at times some of the geeks will engage in an an extended scholarly monologue; you can tune out the monologue entirely and the weak "joke" that involves it won't lose any of its (lack of) punch. That is not witty. The jokes are cheap, boring and expected; I have yet to crack a smile watching this show, so I've stopped, even though the guys are sort of endearing; that's just not enough to make me care. I have no idea how a show as awful as this rates so highly while Arrested Development (which has more laughs in the first 5 minutes of an episode than this show has in an entire season) gets cancelled due to low ratings. It must be the blonde bimbo because his show is so weak. Just because it has some physics and science talk in it people assume it's "clever". None of the characters are even remotely believable, let alone likable and the whole show seems to be one sitcom cliché after another. Sadly, I think this show is going to stick around for a while yet, but at least I can choose not to watch it. If you want a clever comedy watch It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia or 30 Rock and stop wasting your time on this rubbish. The big bang theory is a mildly clever sitcom with a generic vanilla concept. Two nerds live across the hall from a pretty girl, whom they fail miserably to relate to. While there is a modicum of nerdy humor, it is heavily underscored by a hokey, grating laugh track. While laughter cues can be a boon for vapid sitcoms, in this case they serve to ruin any chance that this show had of appealing to intellectual audiences because of the fact that the track is turned up loudest to cover up the least funny jokes. To the kind of person who likes shows about nerds, and can understand jokes about string theory, this show will seem insulting<br/><br/>The characters are very poorly designed. Most sitcoms have a round main character, who is surrounded by auxiliary flat characters. Not so in the Big Bang Theory. All of the characters are static throughout the episodes. This means that they get extremely annoying after a short time. Watching a whole season of this show would be like watching the first episode on repeat, with slightly different Klingon boggle jokes.<br/><br/>In short, avoid this show like the plague. Every once in a great while in the universe, in a rare moment of remarkable synchronicity- the angels of fate smile upon an artist and allow him to create something that is so flawlessly agonizing in every single way. <br/><br/>The fact that anyone can sit through an entire episode of this low-brow, stale, cookie-cutter sitcom is beyond unfathomable to me.<br/><br/>The Big Bang Theory is an enigma- dialogue so incredulous I honestly find myself a bit impressed. It is as if the writers have never in their lives actually heard a human talk. The characters Chuck Lorre has created are almost as phony as the inorganic situations they inexplicably find themselves in. <br/><br/>The show is a Jungian Archetypal manifestation of the idiocy of the collective human psyche. If this were a "geek" show, as it deceives it's appallingly large and overzealous fan-base into believing- then I would understand the appeal on a base level. However, this is a hackneyed carbon-copy of every mediocre sitcom ever made attempting to pass itself off as "smart" and "witty". <br/><br/>The premise is as believable as the actors, whose talent falls just short of low-budget porn. However, I'm not going to snub the actors because their level of ineptitude almost makes all this forgivable.<br/><br/>I had a kidney stone and passing it, until now, was the most excruciating 30 minutes of my life. The US Army was using this show as a form of torture but it was ruled a war crime. It's the new "Friends" alright. Not less cheesy, but at times even funnier. I'm from the generation that grew up with "Friends", but I would vote for the millennials. I feel a bit nostalgic for the 1980's sometimes, but I also understand and appreciate the jokes from the "new kids in town". It's pure fun, no more, no less. It has its flaws, but it has its wits too. It's a medicine for foul moods, depression, and loneliness. And as such, I believe it deserves at least 8 out of 10. I liked the first 6 or 7 seasons but the laugh tracks do get annoying but those first seven seasons do have a lot of classic episodes like the precious fragmentation or the staircase implementation or even the Russian rocket reaction. The show is a must watch especially for fans of pop culture and movies. Season 8 9 and 10 aren't the best but the end of season 10 is great no spoilers but it has a good ending. I still don't really like season 11 but that's my opinion you see the show you see it. The show is great quick breezy watch fun for the whole family and a must watch that's funny has problems but still great and I love it. I need 10 lines of text so I'll fill it in as if it was from The Big Bang Theory: **laugh** I couldn't get through the first few minute **laugh** without getting ill as the excessively annoying **laugh** laugh track (with the same laugh for the entire show. I know because the moron I lived with played it so loud I could hear it through 2 doors.) **laugh** came on with each and every phrase of each sentence of **laugh** each and every annoying character **laugh** regardless of how "funny" it was - **laugh** which of course it wasn't except for the annoying main character **laugh** who had that annoying feminine sarcasm in each and every glib phrase he spewed to try and make it funny - which it wasn't because it was merely annoying. **laugh** 'nuff said. TBBT used to be one of my favorite shows on TV in the last few years, the show's first 5 seasons were really funny, somehow since season 6 the show started to get worse each episode, the characters were losing what made them once great, the writing wasn't as sharp as it used to be, the show changed from a really funny and smart comedy to a boring dramedy, and the show kept getting even worse, seasons 7 and 8 were even worse than 6, the characters lose all of their funny traits. Even the girls are becoming more annoying, Amy is not funny as she used to be in seasons 4 and 5, she just complains all the time now, Bernadette became unbearable. That's enough for me, I gave up this show, I don't think writers can recover what made the show once great. I give the overall rating a 5, these five points are because of funny first five seasons, new seasons would probably get a 0 from me. I am a Yuge fan of this show but there's a distance of heaven & hell between Season 1 & Season 10 of TBBT. This show is currently running through its worst phase. The quality of the show has hit rock bottom. Kaley looks much older than her actual age. Johnny has become fat with soft belly. Jim looks old & his acting became stale. Simon has become less funny. Worst of all is Kunal Nayyar. Man he stinks! His acting stinks. His character was good in 1-5 seasons.And it started deteriorating since then. If anyone were to be fired on the show that would be Kunal. Girl friends/Wives are not funny anymore. This show should have been ended after Season 9. It would have went down in the history as one of the best TV Shows. This show has become as awful as Friends when the show was in its 10th season.Hope Chuck Lorre doesn't kill this show by dragging too long like he did with Two and a Half Men. Jokes don't work.Actors look Old & fat. It is said that this is the last season. Hope he ends well.If not,CBS might even cancel this show. Please don't drag it & end this show after this season. Win-Win for all! TBBT was great as a nerd comedy show, but fails totally as a boy-girl comedy. These black and white characters do not fit for an emotional comedy, but they are great in nerd situations. But now, with all of them in relationships, the nerdiness is gone and the characters are no longer fun, they are just pathetic.<br/><br/>Remember how they introduced Amy Farrah Fowler at the end of season 3? As a nerd on the same level as Sheldon. Now she is just a woman, lost all nerdiness and is just needy for love. She took the same road as Lennard: going from independent nerd to boring needy and dependent to the partner.<br/><br/>I have no clue why they did this, perhaps they wanted to reach out to the female public, and ratings are still OK. At one point, the Big Bang Theory was one of my favourite sitcoms of the past 10 years. The first season I thought was great, with jokes enjoyable without understanding the subject matter, but even better if you did. Though the very caricature like characters (mainly Sheldon) did take a way from the realism, it didn't detract from the show as all I still found enjoyable. The only real problem I had was with Penny. Penny is a character that had little to no personality beyond being the "hot chick" and was either obnoxious or boring. She was used mainly to explain things to the audience, which it being a wide appeal sitcom is excusable.<br/><br/>Season 2 felt like much of the same, which was good so no real complaints here. Leslie does appear a lot more in this season, and I found her to be a weak character, but some like her so I wouldn't say this season's enjoyment is affected by her.<br/><br/>Season 3 is where I feel the show went downhill. With the introduction of Bernadette and Amy, and a shift of character from most of the main cast from nerds to nerd stereotypes, it's pretty clear that they tried make the show appeal to a larger audience, and by doing so alienating those who liked the clever and nerdy jokes with multiple layers to appreciate. <br/><br/>All of the characters become creepy and unpleasant the further the shows go on with the butt of most of the jokes becoming the nerd stereotypes, becoming just another shallow sitcom. A friend describes the show as "Nerd Black Face", which though it sounds extreme, when you really think about it is quite accurate. I haven't seen every episode after the 5th season, but what I have seen is nothing new, besides the character's relationships with each other changing over time.<br/><br/>Overall, I would say the show is still alright, but not the clever comedy gold it's praised to be. I hate this show, that is of no mystery, it is generic as hell as a sitcom, but where it fails the most is in it's representation of geek culture.<br/><br/>Not one of the jokes used is ever used in such a manner that the viewer is laughing with, shall we say, Sheldon, instead, it is directed at the 4 geek characters, as if the creator is saying "these guys are so weird, lol!" and all it takes is a little introspective whilst watching the show to realize that.<br/><br/>Add to that the fact that Sheldon exhibits many symptoms of having Aspergers, and yet the jokes are still directed at the way he acts, which mocks anyone who has the disorder.<br/><br/>This show is terrible; it is intolerant and outright discriminating towards geeks and geek culture, it has no reason to exist. This show used to reach new heights till season 6 , post that it became it took a down slide. The season 9 premier was such a drag that I started chatting on my phone while watching the episode.<br/><br/>That says it all. Chuck Lorre should consider this his last season he should not even think of season 10. I am sad to see Howard reduced to a henpecked husband. His comic timing is kick-ass if used wisely.<br/><br/>I hope the story builds up nicely in the season 9 for the finale season <br/><br/>I think that's where Friends scored more, because for all the seasons they were constant through out.<br/><br/>Each character got enough story line. In this series it's like all about Leonard and Penny and Sheldon. possibly one of the least funniest things of all time, not a tad funny. i tried to give it a chance so i watched 4 episodes and i didn't laugh once it was so bad i thought of killing myself after the 2nd episode i watched. Not one of them is funny especially Sheldon and most people find him the funniest how? watch it at your own peril.Not a single character is good ,the story lines are poor its basically just 4 nerdy morons being morons with weird girlfriends.i would rather watch experience every moment of saw than watch this if you don't feel the same go to the doctor and get checked out because theirs something wrong with you.seriously it is the worst show on TV simply awful. this is one of the shows I have been watching for a very long time and I gotta say that I still think its one of the funniest comedies ever and this premiere episode just proves why I think so I mean someone taking a call during a proposal you cant get that anywhere else and I am happy I watched This show makes me feel dumber even after flipping past it with the remote. The humor is NOT intelligent, nor witty. If you don't believe me, try watching it without the laugh track. Go to youtube, and experience it. I'll wait. ... OK, see my point? The jokes are not funny without them telling you when to laugh. And for the record, nerds don't act like that. I've worked for a software company for over a decade, and I've seen nerds in the wild. While scary at times, they are nothing like this. Sheldon would get punched in the eye. There is nothing redeeming about this show, and it made me take a serious look at CBS comedies and realize that they all suck. ABC is WAY too family friendly, and NBC is just too "cool". Give me FX: Archer, The League, Always Sunny ... Now THAT is humor. This show is complete garbage and I felt like I was getting dumber every time I watched it. Everything is really cliché and predictable and the characters are really annoying. The dialogue is supposed to be geeky, witty and funny but, I don't consider it any of those. It's just a combination of an overused laugh track and a few big words thrown in, a toddler could understand it. If you mute the laugh track you won't even understand why the "jokes" are funny. Also, very poor comedic timing. The Big Bang Theory is "smart" comedy for the masses. If you want to watch a brain rotting show that does all the thinking for you then I would recommend this, otherwise I'd recommend you pass. This is the worst show on television. This is the least funny show on television. Sheldon Cooper is the most annoying, least funny and most unrealistic character on television. I understand it is a television show, and television shows manipulate reality to produce an intended affect, but this show's satirical take on academics is insulting and absurd--if humanity and charity actually exist, Sheldon's fellow colleagues would have beaten him to death. In fact, that is how this show should end. Sheldon's room mates and friends and girlfriend and mother and nemesis' should all beat him to death, then parade his headless corpse through the streets of Pasadena, and then they should all be rewarded. This is the worst show on television in the history of television, and perhaps in the history of art, dating back to the Greeks, and centuries prior. Why would come here and take the time to write this? Because it had to be said ; because I do not understand why people love it so ; because I gave it a very fair chance, watching it with my father for many, many nights. It is not funny. It is sadder than Schindler's List. It is less funny than than whatever you think is the least funny thing you have ever heard or seen in your life, be it a television show, a joke you heard, a meme you've seen, or any thing you thinged that you found so unfunny. It is more horrific than any documentary about a war torn country you have seen. It is the worst show on television ; it is the least funny show on television. And it needs to be stopped before the aliens land and judge us all. Why is this show still on the air? Seriously, it has literally gone through every story beat to the point where it has become annoyingly repetitive, formulaic, and a parody of itself.<br/><br/>The main story has always been that Leonard, a nerdy theoretical physicist, fancies the pants off of the girl next door Penny. The show has gone through every social blunder and faux pas in the book to show that this guy is out of his league trying to win the affections of this blonde bombshell. Against all odds, he ends up going out with her and later marries her.<br/><br/>Cut to Sheldon, Leonard's roommate, the most socially inept of the group, who definitely has some form of autism (nothing wrong with that, I'm heavily supportive of people on the autistic spectrum), who may as well be the series mascot. The amount of times we've had to listen to the same tired catchphrases from him and witness every facet of him being antisocial is irritating at this point.<br/><br/>Next, Howard Wolowitz. A depraved, perverted, self-confident dork who once again spouts out ridiculous lines and phrases that test your levels of tolerance after a while.<br/><br/>Finally, Raj. An Indian science doctorate holder who has selective mutism around women unless he is drunk. Just as ridiculous as the others.<br/><br/>So anyway, each episode shows our main characters pursue some kind of awkward task, fuelled by their own social obscurities. Every other line references a movie or film from either the science fiction or fantasy genres, or some social faux pas that is played for laughs. For the first few series, you'd give it a pass, but now it's just painful.<br/><br/>Also, the main plot of the overall series involved our main characters winning the hearts of women. Well, they've done that now. Now what? Are we just expected to watch them continue to blabber on about Star Trek, Star Wars, Doctor Who, Game of Thrones, Lord of the Rings, or any pop culture reference to the point where we throw a glass at the TV? Chuck Lorre seems to think we're that mindless. Sure, this is the guy who ended his other big series, Two and a Half Men in the most tasteless way possible.<br/><br/>To conclude, this series started off mildly amusing, but after 10 years of the same schtick, they have depleted every ounce of creative essence they had. Very possibly the worst show I've ever seen. I do not know how they could make the show more annoying/uninteresting. I've never been able to watch more than 5 seconds of it at a time.<br/><br/>I only get basic cable, so I often watch bad TV. When I get home from work, I sometimes watch "Family Guy" while I play chess. It's kind of just background. But then, when I hear, "Next on TBS - The Big Bang Theory!" I think to myself, "Thank you for warning me!" and I immediately change the channel to literally anything else. <br/><br/>Sometimes when I'm flipping through the channels, this show is on two or three channels at the same time. It's hard for me to believe that even one person in the entire world likes this show. <br/><br/>1/10 Absolutely terrible. Avoid at all costs. This is one of the funniest shows ever. That is if you limit your viewing to Seasons 1 - 7. Beyond that the show has dropped dramatically in quality. It is simply not funny anymore. It is like they have pushed the "repeat button" and try to recycle old jokes over and over again. Absolute rubbish this show was decent for the first 3 seasons but after that it just became a pain to watch.They abuse the laugh track to make their bland and humourless jokes to make it sound funny go and also they use it after every single line we are not trained monkeys that are supposed to laugh on command. There is little character development sure they have girlfriends now but Sheldon is still a annoying freak same goes for Howard, Leonard is still obsessed with penny no last name and raj still needs alcohol to be able to talk to women!. stop watching chuck Lorre's shows he clearly doesn't care that much about you just look at post- Charlie two and a half men. I have always been a big fan of TBBT because of its nerd driven humour and the chemistry between the gang they are so connected with each other. I followed the series right from the beginning and was never disappointed with the content.
My favourite character from the show is "Jim parsons" #Sheldon_Cooper , i just love him the way Sheldon likes to correct everyone and even the grammars and the way he tells joke and laugh it was hilarious. Love the Whole cast of The Big Bang Theory. Chuck Lorre has a knack for creating programs that expose and explore the male gender dynamic, specifically and for a lack of a better term, beta males. This isn't exactly a show about science, rather it is a show about what nerd's are.<br/><br/>And The Big Bang Theory, is an exemplary show about nerds that - at the unfortunate expense if nerds, geeks and dorks everywhere - demonstrates why we find them so amusing and endearing. Though it made light of the mild abuse that nerds have to endure, it displays aspects of the masculinity that is, in general sense, not talked about within the wider realm of the man-o-sphere. <br/><br/>The success of the show, as in any show, is largely dependent on the superb writing as well as the exceptional acting by the cast. <br/><br/>Jim Parsons is wonderful to watch as Theoretical Physicists Dr Sheldon Lee Cooper. While Parsons is rather cold in real life, his portrayal of Sheldon; the Asperger-like genius with funniest lines, quirks and gestures, make an otherwise highly annoying and obnoxious character likable - which is very difficult to pull off even for expert thespians. <br/><br/>But Sheldon Cooper, is a strong individual; smart, adept, confident, selfish, strives for excellence, unrelenting and resilient. I use selfish in this context as a good thing. Men, specifically Beta Males are taught to sacrifice their live and commit their entire endeavor to please women; which is portrayed magnificently by the other casts. <br/><br/>John Galecki, Kunal Nayyar and Simon Helberg all shine as Dr Leonard Hofstadter, Dr Rajesh Koothrappali and Howard Wolowitz respectively. Each brings forth a dimension of the men's deep psychological trouble, without being too melodramatic or overbearing. Leonard is an emotionally insecure romantic man, Raj is an clingy, effeminate and socially anxious man and Howard is a frustrated man with a voracious sexual appetite. <br/><br/>As you can imagine reading this, they do not exude the strengths that Sheldon has and this is expertly explained why. Leonard and Howard are raised by unfit mothers. Leonard's mother is cold, distant, narcissistic and lacks empathy while Howard's mother is overbearing and emotionally manipulative. Raj's quirks are harder to explain but he too have controlling parents. <br/><br/>And here is why the show is compelling; watching these men struggle to come to terms with their inadequacies and grow is compelling material. Watching Sheldon showing empathy for and understanding to his friends is compelling; watching Leonard becoming assertive in his relationship with Penny is compelling; watching Howard dealing with frustrations is compelling; and watching Raj overcoming his anxiety is compelling. <br/><br/>A footnote about the female casts. Kaley Cuoco, Melissa Rauch and Mayim Bialik all do a fine job with their characters and surprisingly, Mayim Bialik does the best job as she has the best character in Dr Amy Farrah Fowler. Amy is a perfect antagonist to Sheldon and Bialik portrayed a believable and likable nerd girl who pines for his affections. <br/><br/>Penny and Dr Bernadette 'Berny' Maryann Rostenkowski are unfortunately the weakest characters in the show but elevated by the performances of Cuoco and Rauch respectively. <br/><br/>Berny is very amusing, simply because she is 4'11" blonde with a squeaky perky voice that morphs into a nagging harpy when provoked. Rauch performance is pretty good and due to her size, it's hard to be disgusted at an otherwise blatant Mary Sue character that is Berny. <br/><br/>Penny is your typical selfish, inebriate, delusional, slut that dreams of being rich and famous. The reason why Penny is the way she is, is because she uses sex to manipulate man; something that the show openly admits. Penny is the Tradcon's damsel in distress, and she is the perfect catalyst for Leonard-kinds from all over the world to rescue from her own bad decisions.<br/><br/>In fact, Penny and Leonard epitomizes the parasitic nature of relationships. Penny, in all sense apparent to anyone with a brain, is a useless tramp that got by on life due to her looks and having a vagina; a strategy is all too common across cultures and histories. Leonard is your typical thirsty simp that would do anything - including enabling her poor life decisions - just to have sex with her. <br/><br/>Due to this, Leonard do not grow as a person, since he did not quite mature in terms of his own dignity and self respect, while Penny leeches off of Leonard financially and emotionally in a humorous fashion. In the real world, Leonard would've been divorced and broken after 5 years of marriage with Penny when she gets bored of him; a common occurrence in our current era.<br/><br/>Cuoco's performance of Penny is pitch perfect; giving her character just enough balance of entitled degeneracy with charming deception that enables her dysfunction.<br/><br/>All in all though, the show is very enjoyable and is worth watching. I have tried to like this show. I have given it more than a fair shake. it panders to the lowest common denominator. Everyone rips on the laugh track (with good reason) but not enough is said about the poor quality of the jokes preceding the laugh track. Lines containing technical or scientific jargon do not necessarily make for "smart" jokes. This should not be classified as "smart" TV. Arrested Development, Community, Parks and Recreation-these are all examples of shows that are actually clever and intelligent in nature. As many other reviewers have mentioned, being a fan of this show encourages the networks to make more shows like it; this pushes actual intelligent comedy off to the side. This show insults its viewers and they don't even know they are being insulted. It is a travesty that this show is into its 9th season. I know I'm offending like half the population since nearly everyone loves this show but I hate it. Completely and utterly. I don't like how all the jokes are basically the same over and over again. Also the characters don't develop like when Howard marries Bernadette they're just the same. When in other shows they've gotten to the point that they're going to get married the characters have developed and grown up! Not in this show though. Another reason I don't like this show is that all the jokes just make fun of the characters and how do they get away with making fun of Sheldon? Sheldon seems like he has some sort of condition. And I don't get how its gone on for this long. So that's why I hate TBBT. I had high hopes for this show, due to the show's title I expected this to bridge the gap between science and comedy. Sadly they got the formula wrong and decided to add the humour from a lecture on particle physics to the 'science' of fart jokes. <br/><br/>Whilst I appreciate the irony of the show being so formulaic, it does not lend itself well to a TV series. <br/><br/>It is neither funny nor clever, but it tries to be both. <br/><br/>The acting on the whole is pretty bad from the majority of the cast, very OTT, Bernadette is the worst culprit, she cant help but smirk as she delivers yet another 'hilarious' line, it is painful to watch. Penny is not much better, but I suppose initially she was cast as 'eye candy', so was not expected to be able to act properly anyway. <br/><br/>The show started badly, but somehow has managed to get progressively worse as the series have continued. The characters became parodies of themselves and even the script 'writers' gave up on even trying to make jokes. It has transformed from a tiresome comedy into a tiresome drama. <br/><br/>They still rely on some main jokes to guarantee viewer mirth: Howard - Tee hee, he is Jewish LOL Raj - Haha! He is Indian! OMG LMAO! Sheldon - Hohohoho, he is socially inept! Bazinga! Penny - No Way!!! She is a slut! Bernadette - Angry dwarf with squeaky voice! Classic! Leonard - He is short and cant drink milk! ROFL Amy - Female Sheldon, but with sexual desires! Too much!! etc etc <br/><br/>I really do not understand how this show is rated so highly and has been allowed to continue for so long considering how bad it is. It does show that either the general viewing public are toothless simpletons, or just that the majority of voters are toothless simpletons that have somehow managed to work a science box and make the electric words come on the glowy bit using the clicky thing and pressy button block. And it is a shame, because this show had potential. The first seasons are, well written, have plenty of humorous situations and memorable characters. Unfortunately all of these wear off and by season 5 you have your standard sitcom with stereotypical characters that get backwards development to maintain the status quo.<br/><br/>We have to address the whole nerd thing while we're at it, because it's the biggest marketing pull the show has, every advertisement for the show mentions the "nerd" word at least once. This is not a "show about us" as many people praise it. Most of the "nerd" characters in the show are shallow stereotypes. Sure, they get the spotlight but more often than not we are supposed to laugh AT them rather than with them. When you realize the character you're supposed to identify with is Penny you realize you'd be better off watching the It Crowd or Community, if "nerd" humor is what tickles your fancy.<br/><br/>As seasons go on the focus shifts from individual development to couple dynamics. When you axe one of the most interesting female characters (played by a lesbian actress) and give the most celibate, unlikely character to be in a relationship a crystal-clear Distaff counterpart girlfriend so we can have one more couple and make lesbian jokes while we're at it you realize something went terribly wrong. Yes, this is a Chuck Lorre show so rampant homophobia and misogyny are to be expected. And there's also the occasional cringe-worthy writing. "Bazinga". Seriously. This show expects us to laugh at a catchphrase. Did I mention the laugh tracks? That is a sitcom staple that just needs needs to die. Nothing says "I talk down to my audience" like telling them when to laugh. It also happens too frequently and too loud.<br/><br/>I may sound harshly critical of the show but, like I said, it is not terrible. It does have plenty of funny situations and clever writing, particularly its early seasons. But only if you refuse to look at it with a more critical eye. This show could not be more of a cliché if it tried. Comfortably (and continuously) falling back into the "All scientists are nerds and intensely socially awkward" stereotype. I assume that this is an attempt at humour. Unfortunately, none of the characters are even remotely likeable, resulting in possibly the dullest show on TV. Oh, and it gets worse as the series go on... As I personally and many others consider myself a 'nerd', this show has to be the most appalling mockery of nerd culture and humour. This extremely awkward and unfunny excuse of a sitcom is devoid of any real humour or jokes, but is simply a poorly written, poorly referenced, predictable, overrated and often downright offensive piece of garbage.
There are no real gags present in this show, but simply blunt and plain everyday examples of dull, monotonous conversation between some very unrealistic and quite frankly stereotyped characters. Firstly, the female character Penny has real on-screen personality but is simply present for her sex appeal. The characters Raj and Howard are both racially stereotyped and simply play to stale and humourless conceptions about Indian and Jewish men. The character Sheldon, I find, to be a highly insulting portrayal of a person with autism and the jokes about him simply mock his obviously autistic and OCD condition. The character Leonard is the only bearable character but that can't save him from his horrible scripts and his cliched and boring romance with Penny. Furthermore, the excessive pop culture references to nerd culture and fantasy/science-fiction are stale and forced, sucking any life they might have left it them.
I have watched a handful of episodes from every season and unfortunately they all are the same - abysmal and painful. This bottom of the barrel show only appeals to viewers with misconceptions about nerd culture and often those with low intelligence - the excessive use of a nauseating laugh track to tell viewers when they should be laughing, not when they are actually humoured.
Overall, this show is like the black death to nerd culture and humour. If you want some real nerd culture, watch the actually funny and well-written, The IT Crowd. On the other hand, just avoid this unwatchable garbage. Grade F. Like many of the characters in this show, I hold a PhD and work as a research scientist. I avoided this show for a long time. Part of my skepticism was fueled by the fact that most people I know who enjoy the show are non-scientists, plus a handful of engineers who apparently watch it just for one of the attractive female lead characters. I had, without having seen it, and perhaps unfairly, presumed that this show would just be a slew of lame jokes based on stereotypes and poorly- explained scientific concepts.<br/><br/>Then one day, on a long flight, I gave in and watched an entire episode with a mind to giving the show a fair chance. By the end of the episode, I really wanted to meet the writers. So I could punch them all in the mouth. I'd heard so many good things about this show that I felt compelled to give it a try. GOD AWFUL! I can only assume this is what passes as comedy among simpletons. Nerds giving unnecessarily long and loquacious answers followed by laugh tracks just to ensure the viewer knows when to laugh. There, now you've seen EVERY EPISODE. Do yourself a favor and watch It's Always Sunny. Or stare at the ceiling. If you absolutely can't avoid this show, consider removing your eyes This was mildly funny a few seasons ago with some clever lines and live audience but not any more.<br/><br/>The audience has obviously been replaced by a canned recorded laughter track and the really funny people - like Leslie Winkle - have been written out.<br/><br/>The script now is dreadful. <br/><br/>Penny has gone from being a "real good looker" to being an aged drag with a dreadful haircut.<br/><br/>I wonder if this coincided with the main actors demanding super high fees and have effectively killed the golden goose.<br/><br/>Yawn. I love the early episodes, because that's the heart of the show, the hilarious interaction by the brilliant, yet socially inept young nerds and the earthy Penny and the rest of the world of the 'normals'.<br/><br/>IMO, TBBT died when Howard Wolowitz got married and Sheldon was matched up with Amie. Not only is she terribly homely, but rarely funny, where I am concerned. I'd rather watch mold grown on wallpaper than Amie's clumsy attempts to out-Sheldon Sheldon and to fit in and make up for a screwed-up childhood. The taming of the aloof and indifferent to women Sheldon was a sad event in this series. All the really nerdy stuff, idiosyncrasies, tensions, and fun left, when Howard was brought down to earth by that lovely little Biologist,his mother substitute, and when Rajesh received his little dog, since he lost Howard. What a fun and delightfully weird relationship that was. Especially when analyzed and crushed occasionally by Leonard's equally damaged scientist mom. All gone. They should have kept Raj's impediment, his inability to speak to girls. Whenever I see those new girls show up, I lose interest, because I know it will be not what the series was all about, nerd wars. Now it has become sort of a 'chick flick' series. Bringing in Bob Newhart was excellent, and works great with just the four guys and Penny. All the other stuff is really beside the point and outside the brilliance of the original premise of the show. I think CBS should have told the actors to forget the $1M per episode and enjoy their fame and what they already have and whatever they will get from reruns and spin-off goods. Game over. Sadly, I think it's now the (Asian - huge success over there, in those male-dominated societies) female watchers who drive the ongoing success of the story, finding their own verification in the subjugation of every one of those formerly free and crazy, goofy, and, in their own way, manly spirits. All that's left, for the likes of me, is to treasure the original intent of the show and enjoy the reruns. one of the worst, most tasteless comedies that ever was. the jokes are only matched by the standard of acting.<br/><br/>i recommend anyone thinking of watching this trash to go to youtube and search for ''big bang theory no laughing track'' to see just how awful this ''sitcom'' is.<br/><br/>most interactions between the shows ''funny'' characters are drab conversations about hilariously nerdy thing like Nintendo 64's and other comedy gold. this is where your average pleb laughs as they try to understand the intelligence behind the show's humor.<br/><br/>AVOID. I'm going to go against the grain and say I don't like this show. In fact I hate it. I tried to watch it because people said it was "a comedy for smart people" and it "has a bunch of nerdy in-jokes" so I figured I would give it a try, because I am both smart and nerdy and figured that I would find something of value in this show.<br/><br/>I was completely wrong. After watching two episodes from the first season and minor portions of later seasons, I came to the conclusion that this show is garbage. Not just on a bad level, but on an offensive level. I have a science degree, and NO SCIENTISTS I have ever met are like the people on this show, in physics or otherwise. They are educated, but they don't speak in some insulting, condescending way like Sheldon does, nor are they socially awkward or incapable of talking to girls. And sure, while many of them grew up watching science fiction TV shows like Star Trek, they don't have lines memorized and can't recite them on command. And they sure as hell don't have LAN parties, sleepovers, etc.<br/><br/>The Big Bang Theory tries to use geek humor as its punch line, but at the end of the day the joke is not with the characters, instead the joke IS the characters, which is insulting its own target audience. I pondered why the creators would want to deliberately insult their target audience, then I realized that this show is not actually for intelligent people, it's for people who are marginally more clever than the average mouth-breathing idiot to give them something to talk about with their friends and co-workers and feel like they're being "ironic" by acting geeky+cool. I just quit my job at a workplace where almost all of the employees would talk about this show at work. It drove me insane and was actually one of the reasons I quit after only 6 months.<br/><br/>It's not that I don't get the jokes in the show. I just don't think they are funny. I also find it painfully uncomfortable to watch so many geeky characters interacting with each other, just how I would find it awkward to be around people like that in real life. If I actually spent more than 30 seconds in a conversation with a Sheldon-esque person, I'd be so tempted to hit them that I'd have to excuse myself. Maybe I'm just not geeky enough. Maybe I have more respect for science and intelligent people than thinking that we are a bunch of socially crippled male virgins. The show just didn't work for me on any level whatsoever.<br/><br/>Also, the laugh track is completely moronic. I don't want to be told when I'm supposed to laugh, especially when it goes off every 3 seconds. Get rid of that crap, it's been obsolete since the 90's. The Big Bang Theory is, as most people know, a very popular sitcom – in fact, it's so popular it was plagiarised by another show, The Theorists, that used to be aired in Belarus but got cancelled as soon as the word of plagiarism got out. It follows mainly five friends: Sheldon, played by Jim Parsons, a theoretical physicist; Leonard, played by Johnny Galecki, an experimental physicist; Raj, played by Kunal Nayyar, an astrophysicist; Howard, played by Simon Helberg, an aerospace engineer; and Penny, played by Kaley Cuoco, an aspiring actress. Later in the show, other characters become main, like Sheldon's girlfriend Amy (Mayim Bialik) and Howard's girlfriend, and later wife, Bernardette (Melissa Rauch). The Big Bang Theory premièred in 2007 and it still airs.<br/><br/>The comedy in this sitcom is supposed to be clever, since every character is a scientist but Penny. The most loved character (and, in my opinion, the least likable) is certainly Sheldon, for whose portrayal Jim Parsons won multiple awards. Sheldon is a physicist with a huge IQ, who has no social skills or understanding of humour or empathy. Many think the character has Asperger's syndrome, and even Parsons plays his character as if he had that disorder. The other main male characters are equally smart and socially inept, and are fond of comic books, video games, fantasy and science-fiction. Because of this, most of the jokes are either science jokes, or "it's funny because he's a geek" jokes – or jokes about Penny being stupid. That said, just because someone mentions, let's say, 'the String theory' in the show, this doesn't make the show – or the joke – clever.<br/><br/>Moreover, the characters are not very believable. Every one of us has met at least one "geek" in his/her life, and it's obvious those in this show are exaggerated. Here are some life truths this show pretty much ignores: geeks are not socially inept just because they're geeks; they can be stupid, too; their life does not revolve exclusively around their "geeky stuff". Also, these men are scientists, not only geeks: take any famous scientist and you'll see right away that those people are just like all of us non-scientists – they just know much more about science than us, which is only natural since it's their field of work. Of course, this exaggeration can be justified as needed to create comedy, but I don't think many people understand this.<br/><br/>That said, this show can easily be considered offensive to scientists, although it seems to me I'm the first to say such blasphemy. It's also offensive to non-scientists who, in this show, are portrayed by Penny: this way, all non-scientists are supposed to be stupid and naive, going nowhere with their lives and it is okay to make fun of their ignorance. Mind you, for The Big Bang Theory we're all ignorant if we don't know what Fermat's Last Theorem is. Furthermore, almost every line of these offensive jokes is followed by a laugh track that's exaggeratedly long and, obviously, abused. Take the laugh track away, and you realise there's really not much to laugh about – at least for the most part of the show. Another irritating detail are the abrupt and too frequent cuts, but that can be ignored. Conclusively, I hope this show will at least be useful and spur people on studying science, because there are truly never enough scientists in this world.<br/><br/>Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/ If this is what makes folk laugh these days then humour hasn't just changed, it's disappeared. I think if you do genuinely find this show funny, you must be living an intolerable life, because you probably find yourself walking around laughing hysterically at inanimate objects! I mean it, genocide is more comical.<br/><br/>The characters are not just boring, they're irritating to the point of making you want to kill them, and as slowly as possible. It's repetitive, it's flat, it's colourless and it's on television all the time, which lets no space for deservedly funny, well-written comedies. But the worst thing about this show, the screech of a crying baby when you're hungover, nails scraping down the longest blackboard in the world, is the canned laughter. It's there to remind you to laugh. There are videos out on YouTube which will show you episodes of this crap without the laugh track. This doesn't make it the show better, in truth it turns a very humourless show into a painfully awkward and nauseous one. <br/><br/>I wish I could rate the show lower than the solitary star it doesn't deserve because it atrocious. This show is not funny. They try to make joke every 5 seconds and not one of them made me laugh. I don not understand the big deal on this show. It's just nerds and all they do is go over one another's apartments and talk. The girl on it is too good for them all too. My dad always puts it on the TV and that's when I know it's time to go upstairs. The last thing I wanna listen to is pointless jokes and cued laughter. It is not a realistic show and calling it a comedy would be ridiculous. I don't know what else to say about this show. It defiantly doesn't deserve ten lines of my time. It barely deserves one. If I could rate zero stars I would. It's title barely makes sense. I mean okay they're nerdy and whatever but why can you just call the show something more basic like the jokes they have in it. Just don't watch the show and enough said. This show would be really good if they did one thing: got rid of Bernadette. She is a terrible character who literally decreases any value this show could have when she is in a given scene. She has destroyed the freedom Howard would otherwise have to contribute to the show (he was the funniest character before her arrival). I do not understand why they added such an unlikeable character to such a fun cast, or why they include her in so many scenes. This show should stick to its original roots. Sheldon. Penny. Leonard. I don't watch any more for this simple reason and I remain baffled as to why the would ruin such a great show with such an unnecessary, unfunny character. I used to really like this show for the first couple of seasons, but their shtick has become old and stale. The humor used to be much smarter and more clever, it's clearly obvious now that they are pandering to the general public now that it's so popular. Jim Parson's is definitely good, but he does not deserve to still be nominated for the Emmy every year. He hasn't done anything new with this character since the beginning of the show. If you're looking at The Big Bang Theory for just a silly sitcom, its better than most of the other stupid network sitcoms. However, if you're looking for something with more of a unique humor like Arrested Development or 30 Rock, this is not the way to go. This is just a slightly different version of the frumpy guy husband/ pines for hot blond chick. In my Humble Opinion,<br/><br/>This show is one of the greatest modern marvels in the world today. It's watched by a great number of people, and has achieved great critical success and has been awarded with a number of Emmy's. After my friend highly recommended that I watch this show and give it a chance,I watched 6 or 7 episodes and I cannot for the life of me figure out why it has such success. I watched enough episodes to give the sitcom a fair chance, and honestly it was torture for me. I wanted to like it because my friend was so excited that I decided to watch it. I literally didn't laugh once (not exaggerating) and I wanted to, especially when the laugh track told me something was funny throughout the entire episode. <br/><br/>Too me, forced, awkward situations with random statements and pauses that play a laugh track are not funny. A true comedy doesn't need to tell you something is funny with a laugh track played 30 times throughout an episode. In any good show, whether it is a comedy or drama, you need interesting characters that you either like or don't like; But either way you want to watch them because they are intriguing to you. This show features characters that are not only not interesting, they all annoyed me to the point of anger. <br/><br/>But I do have to give the writers and creators of this show credit, because I am completely baffled as to how you can create stale, stereotypical, unfunny characters, place them in forced,awkward and unfunny situations; then have those characters walk in the room and say "Hello" then pause, play a laugh track then air this on television and achieve success commercially and critically. <br/><br/>I never try to be different just to be different or a hater on things that are popular just to go against the grain either. <br/><br/>To each their own, but for me this is the worst series of still images played rapidly in succession through a motion picture camera that I have ever seen on television or film. I started watching 'Big Bang Theory' by a nerdy friend's recommendation: he told me I would love the show, since he always knew my nerdy taste for manga,comic books,star wars,video games and so on. <br/><br/>I downloaded all the episodes in less then a week, and I need to say that I could not be more happy for that! This series is great, not only because it is funny, but because I can identify myself and many of my friends in it! It has a lot of cool references to actual things (like twitter,facebook,Sarah Connor chronicles,etc) and the jokes are the best!It was even hard to believe that it was made by the same creator of Two and a Half Men,Chuck Lorre, since most of the jokes of this series doesn't have anything to do with sex humor.<br/><br/>Of course, there are many physics' jokes that I don't get, but even so, you can learn a lot of different stuff in many of the episodes. (Specially with Sheldon's quotes.)<br/><br/>I really hope that we have more seasons of this sitcom, and also that Penny's and Leonard's relationship doesn't become a 'Ross and Rachel' gig going on again and again, as someone said on the message boards.<br/><br/>The series Plot:<br/><br/>Leonard Hofstadter and Sheldon Cooper are two brilliant and nerdy physicists who live together as roommates and are friends with Howard Wolowitz and Rajesh Koothrappali,another two brilliant geeks.<br/><br/>When Penny,their new blonde hot neighbor, comes to live in the apartment next door,they all will learn how to deal with different realities and funny situations. I have been watching the Big Bang Theory since mid 2011. When I started watching this show, the first few episodes I saw were that of the third Season (the best season, too!) Now, with this being said, I was given the 1-4 box set of the show on Christmas Day of that year (2011). By around March, maybe April 2012 I had seen all four seasons front to back more than ten times each (no word of a lie). I was actually very obsessed with the show. I watched it every day, whether it be my DVDs or just on TV, and this continued and kept going on and on. Season Five had started by this point and I watched it whenever a new episode came on TV. It was truly wonderful. The first four seasons all were terrific. 1, 2 and 3 were particularly wonderful, but the fourth season was also hilarious and awesome, with so many intriguing, genuinely great episodes. I had solid faith that the fifth season would be just as entertaining; just as good. Was I right? Oh, well, quite. By the time the fifth season had come to its end, I had already decided it was by far the least good of the five already-aired seasons. 3, 2, 1, 4, 5 was my order. Nevertheless, 5 was good. It was a solid season with some terrific and brilliant and just all-round good episodes. Nice season, but my least favorite, personally.<br/><br/>Season Six came a few months later. Ah, how it decreased ever so slowly. Having given the first three seasons a 10/10, the fourth a 9/10, and the fifth a solid 7/10, I was hoping the show would go back to being around the, '8, maybe 9 out of 10' points again. I was so wrong. I kept watching, though. Six was okay I guess. Some episodes were great, others were just plain okay. They were fine. I think a solid eight, maybe nine episodes were really good, the rest were fine. From there onwards it rapidly decreased. Seasons 7-9 (from 2013-) just weren't all that great to me. I thought they were the least good seasons but they were alright to view. I'm only saying this because I feel the show used to be so much better; much more interesting, funnier, had better moments, it cared less about relationships and stuff like that. I feel the show's most-of-the-time relationship moments are quite awful and badly-written. I just don't care for it all that much. 1-4 didn't focus on this quite as much, even thought four started to focus a lot on co-stars (soon to be main-stars), Amy and Bernadette. They were likable at first, but as the show continuously progressed, I liked them the least. Personally, Howard's my favorite. I liked it before he went out with Bernadette, or before they got married at least.<br/><br/>Overall, a good show, but I much prefer the older seasons. They're way better, in my opinion. Definitely a lot more funnier and interesting and had fun moments between each character. The episodes were just easier to watch, had lots of great moments, etc. I miss the older tBBT days, but I am happy the show has evolved and has gained a lot of recognition, admittedly it is nice to know it's got a massive fan base who appreciate the show, whether old episodes or new.<br/><br/>1-4 > 5-9 I can never understand why people like this show, none of the characters are funny or interesting, when someone tries to make a joke he just names a couple of famous geek stuff and moves on, and the worst of it all is that it never ends. They can finish this show at any time but they decide not to because of stupid people who laugh at unfunny clichés about Doctor Who and Batman and all of that, they introduce a billion characters and make a billion plots just so 80% of them could f*ck off the next few episodes. Those who do stay in the show are 2 boring characters, one likes the main character Sheldon Cooper although Sheldon doesn't like her and the other marries the LE FUNNI JEW NERD XDD character other characters are the hot girl Penny, the LE FUNNI India GUY and the deuteragonist Leonard hofstandetdheylefunninamedhdgewesuckhsufu.<br/><br/>This show has nothing good or funny to offer and should be taken down, much better comedy shows can be done and they do not have to include a billion seasons and a billion characters I'll be honest, I only stopped liking the show about two-three years ago, and before that, I actually enjoyed watching it. That was until I started to realize that it was not celebrating nerd culture, but it was mocking it. We, the audience, weren't supposed to relate to the four boys, Sheldon, Leonard, Raj & Howard, but with Penny. The girl with the outgoing personalities and with the lack of advanced education. We weren't supposed to be laughing with the nerds, but laughing at them, and I can't help but feel personally victimized.<br/><br/>Now, I like comic books, TV shows, science, and anything else that involves what the typical nerd/geek is interested in and what I feel the show's main goal is, is to tell people that even if those nerds are really smart and successful, you're still better than all of them, because they can't talk to girls and they can't ever be as cool as you. <br/><br/>Not to mention the lack of personality within the characters is apparent which is probably why they have to play the laughing track over and over again every single time a character speaks. It's so hard to consider this show as a sitcom at all. <br/><br/>When I first started to watch the show, I was excited. There's usually not a lot of TV shows with a nerd as the main character. From my observation, in most TV shows, the nerd is just a secondary character, or they're just there in the background. Years later, I started to notice little parts of the show where the audience laughs whenever they boys do something 'nerdy' or 'geeky'. That's when I realize something was wrong. I started to feel more alienated the more i continued to watch the show, so I stopped and I haven't been watching since. I think this show has hit written all over it. While the time slot pretty much makes it certain, the cast is great and the show itself has plenty of laughs. It's not as funny as Two and a Half Men but funnier than Rules of Engagement. This is a very strong line up of shows on a Monday night. Kaley Cuoco who was great on 8 Simple Rules is perfect here and all the guys are fun as the nerds. If I had one suggestion for the show it would be to introduce some female nerds to the mix. One guy mentions a girl who defected to North Korea. I think it would be fun to see what the women who talk math and go to sci fi conventions look like. I know. I know. The point is the dumb hottie in a nowhere job but I think the contrast would help. Still a solid funny show. Someone told me that I would like this show, so I tried it. The humor is childish and dumbed down to an extreme and I honestly didn't even smile. I remember loving Arrested Development as a show for smart people about dumb people. It had multiple layers of humor that necessitated multiple viewings just to put it all together and get some of the "hidden" jokes. Well this is a show is the opposite of that - a show about smart people for dumb people. It makes me sad that this is one of the most successful shows of all time while so many great shows get canceled before they even have a chance. This is the WORST sitcom ever! (If it IS a sitcom at all, and not just some fool's last hope how to attract one's interest.)<br/><br/>I happened to watch parts of some episodes and just wondered why this is said to be a successful series. It's lame, disgusting, horrible, stupid, sick, annoying, unworthy...<br/><br/>The main characters are...well, if they were bad, I'd at least have some words for them, but they are worse than bad...they are extraordinary disgusting and annoying.<br/><br/>I wonder what bad has happened to those people who watch this...But I pity them.<br/><br/>Do NOT watch this and spare your time for something else. Show was great until they brought in girls, Howard became shy, poor husband because his wife bernadete is eating him alive and she is so anoying just like penny who was cute girl and now she is so angry all the time and cranky... all main male characters are afraid of their woman and thats just so wrong and annoying! In the end I really hated girls in show, they were so mean and making all males so stupid... Im a girl and really pay atension about that, why are they potraited man so stupid This was one of the best sitcoms before they all started getting married and started getting kids,the first seasons were amazing though Like many others, I feel like twelve seasons of Big Bang theory was just way too much, the first ones were hilarious and made me love science, sheldon and the team, but after season six it just got boring. This is show is just references and laugh tracks with lame and poorly written characters. All the main characters are simple and water downed tropes that we've seen before. Sheldon, Leonard, Howard and Raj are all nerd with differing levels of social awareness. And they're also scientists. It's weird it feels more like a crappy high school show but it's way worse. At least crappy high school shows can tell a decent joke once in a while. This shows dialogue sounds like "Penny, Penny, Penny",
"What, Sheldon?"
"Someone touched my Superman LEGO set where he was fighting Doctor Doom"
"Sheldon, I don't care about this stupid NERD thing"
"Good cause Superman is DC and Doctor Doom is marvel"
"Sheldon you're the worst person ever, no one talks like this"
"Bazinga"
Yeah it's not good. Parodies are funny but that's the only positive thing I can say. Which isn't even about the show. I remember laughing a few times during the first two seasons.
Then it became another Friends-like show for people who think they are "geeking" when they use facebook on their iphones.<br/><br/>I guess it's like seing an old person falling down the stairs for almost 10 years.
That is long, slow and painful. The Big Bang Theory is a series that started with a innovative and convincing concept: Use some nerds, mix scientific language with "normal" young-adult interests, and take the obligatory pretty girl around them for distraction and humor elements. The problem is that you cannot go with this concept for more than a few seasons. The pattern of the jokes becomes repetitive and the mimic cues of the actors wears out. Moreover, while it may be subjective, the acting skills of Kaley Cuoco are extremely limited and make it hard to watch her over an extended time (against her, Steven Seagal easily appears like a Golden Globe winner). Overall, the first two or three seasons are quite enjoyable whereas the subsequent seasons are only for hardcore fans. Generic, bland, comedy, relying on awkward relationships and smart comic lines, that aren't.<br/><br/>We really needed another one with a group of friends living close to each other, falling in love, falling out, etc etc? That's been done. Many times.<br/><br/>Can't blame the people who commission this, but it proves that people like their comedy like soap operas. Because it's the lives of the characters not the comedy that keep them watching this, rather than any comic genius. Agreed, all comedies with a long life do this to a certain extent, but that's not necessarily their raison d'etre.<br/><br/>At the time of writing TBBT is rating 0.1 less than Fawlty Towers, the same as Black Adder 2, more than Scrubs, and many others. But unlike this, they won't be forgotten in twenty years. There was a time when I thought this show was the bee's knees, but that day is long gone. I don't think it has anything to do with the show itself declining in quality, since I've mostly just watched reruns of it anyway. I just have absolutely no taste for it anymore. Most of the characters are annoying, overdone and kind of flat, especially Sheldon, who gets very predictable after a while. I used to love the nerdy humor, which was probably my initial attraction to it, but then I realized it was actually really lame and consisted more of mentioning nerdy things than actually making jokes based on them. It also tends to rely quite heavily on dirty humor that mostly consists of just mentioning something blatantly crude or sexual without even trying to be remotely clever about it. It just isn't funny and I'm not really comfortable with it.<br/><br/>I'm not rating it less than five stars because I used to genuinely enjoy it, so I guess it's the kind of thing that's fun for a while. It just really isn't my taste at all anymore. I have been watching this show for so long. It finally ended today for me with the last episode. Great ending to the wonderful series. This show is more mature than Friends or any other family entertainment. This show has been with me during the best and worst day of my life. Highly recommended to all. The first three seasons were enjoyable but like every other Chuck Lorre show, they kept milking it to the point where it just became repetitive and annoying. So glad it's ending soon (hopefully). It's a funny, eyecatching and hilarious T show.
BUT, why the hell on earth they are usually eating or drinking?! Actually they're not eating but playing with the cutlery or food.
How many meals do they have a day? Bazinga haha funny, No. just no. By far the worst thing to ever be called a "tv show" just steer clear of this mess. I think it used to be brilliant. Just like Friends and other similar shows, but it's run it's course. Mankind looks for change even when chance isn't asked for. It the Darwinian concept. But, in fairness, it was never going to be allowed to exist. It pains me to give this show a 6 out of 10. When I 1st discovered this show, I couldn't believe I found such a gem. I Couldn't get enough of it. I Got my parents and Brother to like it. That never happens. Somewhere along the line it lost its Science edge and turned into a typical relationships program. Over the past 3-4 seasons I watch each episode once and that's it. Before, I would watch each episode 4-5 times. What a shame, truly a shame. I can only guess they changed their format. Once the guys started getting girlfriends. In doing so they went from an "edgy" original show to mediocre. They should have hired more female writers with an eye towards the Sciences. I remember when i came across this show in June 2014 and went through all the season within 2 weeks. Yes! I loved it that much. The characters had so much of an awesome personality you literally fell in love with them. <br/><br/>Sadly, since the new season 9, the series has become less of a comedy and more of a drama, that the jokes don't seem funny anymore. You would probably still enjoy every episode but you will not be anxious to watch the next episode. I think its best the series should just end and be remember as an amazing TV series before it seriously damages its reputation. The Big Bang Theory started off as a unique, captivating sitcom especially for nerds like me who cherished the jokes on interference pattern, quantum theory or be it the limbic system. The show kept its qualities intact, its jokes at par and the acting believable.<br/><br/>Fast forward a few seasons (around season 7, if I recall correctly) and it became a regressive, boring sitcom where the actors seem uninterested, the jokes non-existent. It makes me wonder if there are even writers for this show. The current season is as dreadful as the last season and will make you realize the importance of the time you just wasted watching it.<br/><br/>Watching an episode of the initial seasons and the current season/last season is comparable to hearing Adele and Rebecca Black sing. First, this show is very over-hyped and popularized. It can be very comparable to music that people realize they only like because other people did. No, onto the show's characters. Sheldon Cooper - a stereotypical unsocial genius. His quirks are only to be expected on TV. At first they are not overdone (Season 1), but eventually his quirks become so many that he is constantly out of character and a caricature of being out of character. It just gets worse on the most recent season. Overall character rating: 5. Early on, 7; later on, 3. Penny - the (hot) girl next door. She bounces throughout the series from anywhere to a mentally challenged teen, to a nerd who wants to study. She was a lot more consistent in the early (good) seasons. Last season, she was portrayed as an incompetent, dumb character who could not use glue nor scissors. This was not done in a funny way. Now, suddenly, this season, she is a matured woman with a new haircut that imprints a pale taste into the character. She is now an underdeveloped overly played bore. Overall character rating: 3. Early on, 6; later on, 2. I need to skip the rest for now, but I'll get on to the show for overall feel. Used to be decent -- the show was pretty well thought in the early seasons. Although there were some natural character balancing, it was an actually enjoyable show. Now, it has taken a boringly done stereotypical look on nerds. This recent season may just make the overall feel of the show bad.<br/><br/>I suggest, if you watch, to quit around seasons 4 or 5. Starting with season 6 (Howard going to space) it just gets bad. This show use to be great really original and funny but every since season 4 it has been so sh!t. They are obsessed with pairing everyone up what made this show so original was that they were nerds being nerds. I can understand the Lenord and penny relationship and kinda like Bernadette (and like how they changed Howard's character to a witty sarcastic guy) but they shouldn't pair up Sheldon and raj they are so funny just being socially awkward. It's like an annoying kids show now and doesn't have the smart jokes it use to i give the old seasons a 8 or 9 and the new ones a 1 or 2 they are truly horrible. The old one's are great but the new ones are just bad. This is a long review. I just watched an episode or two from the last year and there was not a single laugh in either one of them. I stopped watching regularly three years ago and just checked in on an episode every other month or so.<br/><br/>The show writers were either told or were terrified to change a single thing about any of the characters. Not one darned thing. They were either told to or were afraid to, NOT change a thing. To keep writing the same jokes over and over and try to tell them in different ways.<br/><br/>I first watched the show in the first season and the first few episodes didn't do much for me but it grew on me as the characters fleshed out and I actually would laugh out loud because it was just getting funnier and funnier.
Great writing, the actors seemed to enjoy working with each other. The chemistry showed a good choice of actors by the producers and directors.
The show was a few minutes longer too. Now it seems as though it is what you watch between the incredibly terminal commercials.<br/><br/>BUT by the 6th season the jokes became repetitive.
The bit about everyone having to wear the exact same clothes became visually annoying. And they still are. Leonard still wears that awful jacket in CA's 110 degree heat?<br/><br/>Then Raj's character became such an ahole I got to the point where I was flipping him off when he came on screen. They made him so annoying, unlikeable that no one would keep someone as a friend who snitched them out constantly, told secrets to everyone, who made a point of ruining dates, dinner, lunch, anything and everything. How many times did they all turn to him when he would screw one of them over by opening his mouth to snitch or tell a secret and go "RAJ!!". And come on, why didn't they just have him come out of the closet. His character was made so gay he could almost set the stage on fire he was so flaming. Besides it would have actually added some interest in the show. Allowed it to go in a new direction sometimes. I know the actor would NEVER go for it. Watching him on talk shows he is as annoying on those shows as he is on the series. No one would keep someone that awful as a friend. They would begin to drift from him. As well he has no honor and is a thief. WHY write him like that? What was the point? As I said in real life no one would have a thing to do with someone that horrible.Right now I am watching for the first time the episode where Penny discovers a comet and Leonard takes Raj's side against her and Raj just plain STEALS the credit and the way the episode was written I wanted to just smack Leonard for putting his wife down saying it would be good for Raj's career so just let him have it. THAT would have been a get out of my life moment. The character of Leonard is written as such a coward. He never stands up for her. Divorce time.<br/><br/>Leonard was funny to begin with. His fumbling over Penny was funny and cute. BUT it got old after awhile. The jokes began to repeat themselves and worse, telegraph themselves. The way he dressed was not believable. He NEVER takes that godawful jacket off. Who goes to work and leaves their jacket on then goes home and leaves it on until bed? It became visually annoying as well. WHO decided that they were not allowed to dress like normal people. YES I know they were supposed to be nerds but even nerds grow up and dress like adults. And he is still wearing that thing.<br/><br/>Howard was funny in the beginning as well. But his lines began to fall flat around season 6 and by 8 they weren't even funny anymore. His horndog persona was funny to begin with but luckily the character of Bernie came along and that, thankfully, stopped. I cannot stand the character of Bernie one bit. She is an awful character too, constantly putting Howard down. Oh and time to get rid of that idiot dicky.<br/><br/>The character of Sheldon after TEN YEARS has gotten worse. He is around people who have what would be called normal behaviour but for some reason the producers, writers, studio..whoever, decided to never allow him to stop being such a rude human being no one would ever be a friend to him. No one. In fact it appears the writers and producers are trying desperately to make him even more over the top rude and nasty, thinking that would make him funnier.<br/><br/>NO it made him even worse. In real life he would have been called out for his rudeness. And the writers are doing the same thing soap opera writers do. No one says a single word when a simple 'stop being so rude and mean' every time he was, would change things. Instead writers had whomever he was treating rudely to just get a blank stare. (laughs galore.....not)<br/><br/>Penny...her character was never anything but all over the place. BUT she was very sympathetic. She was trying to make a dream come true.<br/><br/>Something I have NEVER understood in comedies or any show for that matter is why no character is EVER allowed to become successful. I have always felt the show would be wonderful if she divorced Leonard since she obviously has no respect for him and he doesn't seem to like her anymore either, and became a huge star. WHY NOT? We have seen a lot of stars who only took one successful show to become huge. Lets make Penny have her dream come true.<br/><br/>They do not really like each other deep down, and there is no chemistry at all between them anymore. There never really was. It was a great introverted highly intelligent person's fantasy to land the total babe. But it didn't really work in this show. Lets be honest about it.<br/><br/>Bring Sheldon's very attractive assistant from a few seasons back. SHE would be perfect for Leonard. She really admired and liked him. Plus she gets him out of that awful jacket.<br/><br/>Why they decided to NEVER allow any of these characters to develop to more adult and mature people even a little I think is what began the slow down fall of the show. I think people watch it now, (and I am not one of them) out of habit.<br/><br/>My niece who finished her last year of college in 2016 (post graduate studies) said when she started college, it was a must watch show for most of the students. They would have watch parties but she said the same thing...they no longer watched the show at all. NO one even talks about it like they used to"Did you see lasts nights episode when Sheldon..." etc. Not a peep anymore. It became stale and no longer funny.<br/><br/>The ladies.
Okay SERIOUSLY...Amy is still wearing the EXACT same clothes year after year? WHY is it characters are NOT ALLOWED TO WEAR anything else? She is friends with two women who dress in modern adult clothes but somehow writers treat us like morons. Put her in adult clothes and what? We are going to say Hey what happened to that other girl who was married to Sheldon??<br/><br/>I lived in L.A. off and on for 40 years and have NEVER seen a woman dress like that. Or anywhere on Earth.<br/><br/>Bernie. What a witch. Seriously she is a liar, puts her husband down nonstop and it mean to the other people. The character as written is MEAN and condescending.<br/><br/>The chemistry that held the show together has vanished. Almost as though they are no longer there mentally. They just show up do their lines and hop into their cars and go somewhere else. Phoning it in.<br/><br/>How about really turning it up.
Penny divorces Leonard and becomes a huge star.<br/><br/>Leonard ends up with Sheldon's hot assistant from a few seasons ago. They get married and have children and live happily ever after.<br/><br/>Howard grows a pair and finally puts his foot down about who he is and who he was when Bernie met him and if she doesn't like it she can just get the hell out.<br/><br/>Amy grows up and learns how to dress like an adult mature woman and finally tells Sheldon to stop talking down to her or they are finished. BUT also stops treating every woman who talks to Sheldon as a mortal enemy. That got old real fast.<br/><br/>Stuart is doing fine but still has this idiot attitude of not taking a hint.That is stupid. Stop it. Have him marry the girl and move out and live happily ever after.
His store turns into franchises and he becomes very well off.<br/><br/>SHELDON....finally discovers the secret to FTL, and gets to have his own spaceship and takes off for a five year mission to go where no human has gone before and lives happily ever after. OKAY that one...would be fun but...<br/><br/>Anyway he finally goes to therapy and begins to realize what a jerk he has been and grows up.<br/><br/>I mean they need to do something to make the show end on a good note because right now IT SUCKS. This show would be dead in the water if it weren't for Sheldon Lee Cooper. Honestly, I don't know what all the buzz is about.<br/><br/>The humor is a bunch of incompetent babble spewed from Sheldon, and we watch it to feel socially adjusted. "Sheldon, could you make breakfast?" "No" "Why?" "Because I don't want to." Cue the laugh track. Isn't the above text hilarious? No? Then why do people watch this show? The writing is poor, watching Leonard and Penny's relationship is dreadful, the only thing that people laugh at is sarcasm and most of all, the whole show seems fairly mean spirited. The guys hang out every night and somehow only have bad stuff to say about each other. It's not a bad show, its just horribly overrated. why do people find this so funny I heard my friends say this is the funniest show ever why this show is boring I tried watching it I really tried but no jokes got a laugh from why I think I know now why the public find it because they are laughing at the nerds not laughing at jokes but laughing at them as if they are bulling them it explains everything why they are so awkward why I can not understand a word they are say this show is made to bully nerds that's the only answer to the question that explains everything by the way explain why it is so funny without saying nerds are funny can not can you thought so this show should be banned This show is not funny anymore , because they are not geek anymores. It became a show full of romantic crap. I used to like this show. Because they were total geek. There we jokes about science. They were actually doing experiments on the show. What is it now? A show about sex experiences. If one looks at the initial reviews of BBT it appears as if it is the coming of a new form of sitcom and easily eclipsed those already on air. I didn't find it quite that good but it was decidedly better than it has become after nine long seasons.<br/><br/>Many original comments stated people felt there was not enough comedy material to support a continuing sitcom featuring a cast of nerds. I agreed with that consensus but it did last longer than I expected. Then, like most sitcoms, it trailed off into improbability and the magic died.<br/><br/>Of the cast the best is also the worst. Jim Parsons is a very adept actor but he is also, like Robin Williams, prone to overstate his presence and can become quite the bore. A little Parsons goes a very long way and having him act like the childish Jerry Lewis does him, and the series, no good.<br/><br/>Johnny Galecki plays a decent straight man but his almost constant whining becomes old quickly.<br/><br/>Kaley Cuoco is a brilliant dumb blonde but they changed her character into yet another straight comedy character. She looks bored to death in the latest episodes and so are we.<br/><br/>The characters of Raj and Howard could have been given a lot more latitude instead of their limited, and sometimes very unrealistic, roles. With very few exceptions they were wasted and required the addition of Bernadette and Amy to given them substance. The pairing of Amy and Sheldon could have been the highlight of the show but their constant disagreements and the (again) childish actions of Sheldon killed that possibility.<br/><br/>This sitcom could have been a classic in the manner of I Love Lucy or All In The Family but it fell way short due possibly to the absence of competing material. I had friends who recommended this show to me and while i found the show watchable what made me stop was the canned laughter. I swear, if you removed the canned laughter the show would be 10 minutes per episode.<br/><br/>The jokes are not very funny and most revolve around Sheldon breaking some social convention, failing to understand a social convention or the people doing nerdy things. As a TV comedy show you can forgive a mediocre premise and standard jokes because sometimes you want something in the background while you raid or do some grinding in whatever game one is stuck in, but even at that level the laugh track is to annoying and you realize that if you remove the laugh track the characters stand around grinning for 5 seconds after every line they spout which may indeed be accurate of how incredibly stupid every character is. The Big Bang theory is the highest rated show in America at the moment and the most popular show in the world.I do not understand how this pathetic show got popular in the first place.The four main characters are the most stereotypical nerds ever as they love comic books, video games and sci-fi movies and TV.Either the writers have been locked in a room the last ten years but all the following are mainstream past times for the majority of the world.The characters not very likable and after a while are all completely intolerable.Leonard is the most normal of them all, He has an obsession with his neighbor Penny, a stereotypical dumb blonde who is just annoying.Leonard is also lactose intolerant because the writers think because he is a nerd he must have a disease. Sheldon is a perfectionist genius who is the most popular character in the show.By the third season his character was basically turned into a greedy little man child who deserves to be hanged.Sheldon is also in a strange relationship with Amy the worst character in the show and possibly in the history of TV.Raj is the worst of the 4 nerds as he cannot talk to girls do to his low self confidence.He is obviously gay not like that is bad but the show makes it seem like they think gay jokes are good for a cheap laugh.The most tolerable nerd is Howard who is a pervert who often flirts with penny and any other girl besides Amy.Howard was ruined by the writers having him marry Bernadette a girl with a squeaky voice because the writers think this is funny.Howard is allergic to peanuts because like Leonard nerds must have diseases and allergies.Anyone who was curious about this show please for your own well being stay away from it and for any fans who read this review and disagree get a gun and shoot yourself in the knee cap because you deserve to suffer rather than a quick death. Horribly unfunny.<br/><br/>The first few seasons were unique but once the original premise was abandoned it became unwatchable.<br/><br/>Watch It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia if you want comedy. This review would have been very different if I had written it 2-3 seasons ago. Back then I felt like this could become the Friends of the 00/10's and would definitely rated it with a 9, possibly a 10. But since I have to consider all seasons that is no longer the case. It feels like the story is running out of content and has been put on repeat. Sheldon's (lack of) humor was making him very likable in the beginning, now it is getting annoying. The relationship between Penny and Leonard has been going back and forth so many time that it feels like watching a stroboscope. And while Bernadette and Amy (arguably the strongest character) were great additions we sort of got stuck with the same bunch since then. My suggestion, watch until the end of season 6 and assume that Leonard will not survive his trip to the North Sea. From then onwards it is getting painful to watch these beloved characters stop their development. Have the writers slipped into auto- pilot? I really don't get it why this mediocre TV show (and mediocre is very generous) is so popular? Acting is terrible, their comedy is so forced and artificial that soap operas next to it seem like a pinnacle of acting. It's just awful and and an insult to all other sitcoms. Not recommended at all! The Big Bang Theory was one of the Best comedies ever created. if you are a nerd, Intelligent, you would love it. it's jokes are absolutely relate-able to you. the jokes were quite intelligent, you need to be smart to understand the intelligent humor. 
Season 1 to Season 6 are Pure Masterpiece comedies, from funniest Characters to humorous plots, it was great. I would rate it 11/10. you must watch it.
Then it started going downhill, lost it's true charm, original nerd comedy to becoming ordinary same sitcoms about boring relationship stuffs, every character we loved has changed beyond the recognition. 
season 9, 10 11 are worst. better avoid watching this seasons.
please stop the show, damage has already been done considerably or else TBBT will be hated and people will forget how great this show once was..
Let the Show gets decent exit with dignity.. A lot of people are complaining about the new big bang seasons. In my opinion, yes, the old seasons are better, but it's still good. It does have a little bit of relationship stuff, but the people who complain about that, obviously miss the fact that at least 50% of good shows still have some relationship drama, etc. It's slightly losing it's edge and it's going a little stale, but it's still a good show. My complaint is that it's a little less original than it used to be, but they still do have some original jokes. Another complaint that other people are making is that it's lost what makes it different from other sitcoms. My opinion on that is, what's so bad about other sitcoms? Sitcoms are funny TV shows that people enjoy watching. My only other genuine complaint is the laugh track, but that's not entirely their fault. They film in front of two hundred super-fans of the show, so the fact that it's so loud isn't completely their fault. All in all, I think that the big bang theory is still a decent show which has gone a little bit stale, but not too bad and I think right now it's getting a lot more hate than it deserves. Like many other TV-shows, Big Bang Theory started good, but went downhill after few years.<br/><br/>I loved it for first 4 seasons because it was about 4 nerdy guys and their hobbies. Together with some science and Penny as a hot-girl-next-door, the series was perfect.<br/><br/>But later they introduced more female characters, and from season 5, it became a show about relationships. Boring. Big Bang Theory lost it's magic. I first started watching the Big Bang theory back when it first started airing. I remember seeing the first episode and thinking to myself wow what have I stumbled across. It was original and had great jokes. Each character was unique and different from each other. It was all going so well. But fast forward six years and everything has changed. Some positives but a lot of negatives. I will start with what is positive about the new show.<br/><br/>The positives of the new Big Bang theory is that it is aired more frequently for the audience and it has broadened itself out to a more general audience. That last point is a negative for me but a positive for the new comers.<br/><br/>The negatives is that every character in today's show are so normal and generic. Gone are the days of the four main nerds, Sheldon, Leonard, Howard and Raj, which I remember. Each one of them had a trait the other one was missing making their group perfect. Each one having their own witty one liners. Today the characters are all the same. Sheldon has lost his condescending nature and has become more out going and as I would put it "normal". Howard is no longer rude and vulgar. And raj is confident and more out spoken. Leonard is the only one who stayed the same but he was always the least funniest of them all. Penny was a side character for a lot of the Big Bang theory and now she is a central characters again showing the series change from being unique to generic as penny was always a really generic character, the hot blonde who has jokes that are very plain( usually involving alcohol or getting annoyed by the boys nerdy ways). The other two characters Amy and Bernadotte are also centralized and I don't like it. I have nothing against women being the central characters because I liked Amy and I think she would have been a great central character if she didn't change from the brainy, socially impaired character she was to the now outgoing and less condescending character she now is. She was one of my favorite characters. This is the point I am getting to. Every character has developed into something completely different and I don't like what they have become because every thing they had which made this show unique has now been changed to more general character types which I feel is to attract more viewers.<br/><br/>Not only are the characters worse but the story lines are getting even more over the top. The Big Bang theory didn't need over the top story lines as it relied only on it humour alone. Now because the jokes require more they have to add more to their story lines. <br/><br/>In conclusion to sum everything up the characters have had drastic changes. Yes I know there has to be character development but they weren't developed properly. The story lines are more the focuses now then the humour which is a problem considering it is a comedy series. The Big Bang theory was a show I used to love but now I rarely watch it unless I turn on to the station by chance and even then I don't really enjoy it. It is a series which if it keeps going will continue to decline. Hi,consistent Big Bang Theory viewer. I used to be like you, laughing at all of Sheldon's antics, and being concerned over the relationship of Penny and Leonard. I used to love this show. So, why am I currently writing a two star of this show that is TV's #1 comedy? Well, I realized that it is absolutely complete utter friggin' crap! Get ready to feel my pretentiousness in full effect. First, let's examine the characters. All these characters are STEREOTYPES! I'm sorry if this is your wake up call, but these characters are more stereotypical than the racist robots from Transformers 2. First, we have a dumb blonde, a "nerd" that takes everything literally, a super horny nerd who doesn't have the best luck with girls, the "cool" nerd who is found to be attractive, the nervous guy who can't talk to girls, the obnoxiously loud Jewish parent... need I go on? The Humor? Well, I definitely have something to say about that. All the humor relies on either Sheldon taking something literally because he's so socially awkward, to which you, the average reviewer responds "Oh, that Sheldon. He's so out of his element! Hahahahahaha!", or the stupid kind of humor that anyone could understand. And that's the major problem I have with this show. It doesn't try to be clever or complex like Arrested Development or Community, but rather just tries to tell basic jokes. It doesn't tell "science jokes" but rather tells "jokes about science". What I mean by that is, instead of saying something like "Girls are like quantum physics: They act differently when you're not observing them." they say something like "we'd better solve this problem with SCIENCE!" Basically, it's not a smart show for smart people, but a dumb show pretending to be a smart show. With respect to the widespread appeal to this show, I understand why people enjoy it. Just as a plate of fries and a hamburger will be more than enough for many to devour, such is the writing for The Big Bang Theory. <br/><br/>To be brief, the show is cheap. It mingles the nuances of the modern day 'geek culture' with an obnoxious laugh track. I have to admit, I laughed through a couple moments throughout the seasons I watched, but it never warranted any lasting humor. It claims to be for individuals subscribed to the geek culture; the culture founded on the intricate details in fantasy, the depth of broken characters, the irony of society and their standards, the curiosity inherent in all living creatures. The Geek Culture is not the audience of The Big Bang Theory, not what the Geek Culture was originally. Instead the show serves meaningless references to nostalgic elements of our childhood, reinforces audience stereotypes, and promotes superiority over those deemed 'stupid.' The show is not smart, the characters are conflicting, the humor is trite, and worst of all the show is riddled with an overused laugh track. <br/><br/>The Big Bang Theory is formulaic. It utilizes a pretty and busty blonde for the male audience, incorporates a laugh track, mixes popular culture and obvious references that incite nostalgia. The science in the show is awful and should not be mixed with laugh track. After every science fact Sheldon spews, the laugh track plays so the audience knows something 'scientific' occurred. The show frequently endorses and champions superiority against the 'normal' demographic in The Big Bang Theories setting. Often I find it embarrassing when a laugh track cues after a lead character recites a scientific or pop culture reference and another individual does not comprehend. It can be boiled down to: "LOL XD YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND QUANTUM MECHANICS/ANIME/Nintendo OMG You're SO STUPID." This might give insight to a bigger problem which is the growing conceit in our population that does not know failure and modesty. <br/><br/>To conclude, I do not hate the show but I find it very cringe worthy. Friends and family enjoy the show because they understand the popular science references but less for the humor. I implore others to look at the show with a critical eye. This show is one of the best sitcoms of the day. Although I have only seen one episode (the second one is still on my DVR, ready to be watched), I believe this show will have many more seasons to come. The jokes are delivered with dry humor, which makes it even funnier. I can't wait until I can watch the next episode. I think that the story line of two nerds is the best and most creative that I have seen yet. And that ditsy blonde chick makes me laugh every time I just see her, because she is so stupid. Every thing she says gets me laughing. And then the friends of the two main nerds are even nerdier. The best show ever!!<br/><br/>Make sure you check this one out! I first watched "The Big Bang Theory" on the recommendation of a friend who assured me that it would appeal to be because of its purported "Geekiness". To an extent, this IS true - it has a fair bit of geek talk. However, it seems to have forgotten the part where it's meant to be a comedy.<br/><br/>The show revolves around nerdy and socially awkward friends Sheldon, Leonard, Howard and Rajesh, and their new neighbour Penny, who is not geeky in the least. The chemistry between the decidedly normal Penny and the gang on nerds across the hall is the main catalyst for jokes here, ones that often fall flat. The writing is so poor that a laugh track (which lasts for far too long) is often the only indicator that a joke had, in fact, just taken place. For instance, consider the following joke from s03e13 "The Bozeman Reaction":<br/><br/>Sheldon: My new computer came with Windows 7. Audience: *Laughs* (This lasts for 4 seconds) Sheldon: Windows 7 is much more user-friendly than Windows Vista. Audience: *Giggles loudly* (This lasts for 2 seconds) Sheldon: I don't like that. Audience: *Laughs riotously and applauses* (This lasts for 6 whole seconds!)<br/><br/>Even forgetting the obvious product placement for a moment, there are things wrong with this. It's slightly humorous due to the deadpan delivery, but is completely ruined by the baffling robotic audience reaction. Throughout every show, the laugh track deployed lasts for so long that often the actors are just stood there, staring blankly into space before they can make the wisecrack which sparks off another 10 seconds of canned laughter. The scholarly rants that they occasionally get are played off for fun, often with Penny looking idiotically at them before making some sort of comment regarding how 'wierd' they are, something which does a very good job of alienating the geeks this show is (according to friends who gush about it) aimed towards. It seems very much aimed at people who want to feel smart whilst still being able to feel superior to the people who actually know what they're talking about.<br/><br/>The story lines are trite, the jokes are moronic, the characters are clichéd and if you like this then you're probably one of those iPhone- wielding hipster faux-geeks who couldn't tell me what a RAID array is if they tried.<br/><br/>I should also point out that every single person who has recommended this to me because "it's aimed at people like you (geeks)" is nowhere near a geek in any sense of the word. No true geek I know considers this a good show. Very telling.<br/><br/>Rated 3 stars out of 10 because although some jokes shine through, they're jewels in the big steaming pile of horrors that is TBBT. This show for some reason is a big hit and I can't figure out why. I should be able to relate to the show as it is about "geek" culture, which I am very much a part of (working in the Information Technology field for 6+ years), but I do not find this show to be the least bit funny. The characters are horrible and Sheldon is a total douche, who has this snarky arrogance about intellectual wit.<br/><br/>The jokes are not "smart", as some fans claim them to be. I find most people who do like this show are not geeks, and the characters are pure stereotypical "geeks" which is a very bad stereotype of the geek culture.<br/><br/>Horrible show. Firstly i want to clarify that I am a nerd in my own way and I absolutely understood every 'joke' or 'comedy' that was intended for this series. But understanding them doesn't mean I find them funny in any other way. I'll admit that the actors in it is doing a mighty fine job and deserves every praise. But the script writing is outright stupid and boring. And it has the most annoying character in the history of TV series - Sheldon. This is NOT a comedy of any kind, it's the most depressing, boring and annoying (yup, this is the key word) series I've watched. And I watch a lot of series. It doesn't offer any rewards of any kind (no entertainment value), and it doesn't have any meaning in it whatsoever. The only thing that really shines is Penny. And now I understood why people don't want to become scientist, because they watched this. What can I say about this godforsaken television show? Many questions come to mine when someone for some reason says "Big Bang Theory." 1. Why is this still on TV, better yet, why is this ON TV? I have sat through numerous episodes and have never ever cracked a smile, thus reflecting to my title.<br/><br/>Everyone I know thinks its one of the most corny, unfunny and horrific shows on television, and maybe in TV history. Then I come on here and see people loving it?! GTFO. The jokes in this show are absolutely pathetic, and I think I found more humor in watching a spider crawl across my ceiling and then fall last night. The actor who plays Sheldon makes me want to let out my pet rats in my grandmother's room who happens to be allergic. If you haven't got my point, I hate this show.<br/><br/>I don't hate anyone who likes it, this is just my opinion, and it gets a 1/10 for me. The show should be cancelled immediately, and note to the creators: take out the audio clip of laughter in the background...I get you're trying to make it seem like someone is telling a joke, but its just corny. After a couple of friends and a relative mentioned enjoying this show, I looked it up and thought it had some promise. Scientific guys interact with the "real world". Unfortunately that promise fizzled almost immediately as I started watching it. The biggest problem is the extreme over-use of various stereotypes about "nerds" and the abundance of canned laughter about the same basic joke, over and over. Perhaps the episode I saw was not the best, but there were no redeeming qualities here, and the characters were fake, annoying and just not believable. I understand humor is a highly subjective thing, but I prefer subtle humor, irony and the odd contradictory situations we occasionally find ourselves in.The comedy of Seinfeld is an example. Not being hit over the head with predictable jokes. I have to say this show is worse than boring, it is absolutely painful to watch. God, this show is so overrated and so dumb, that I just want to blow my head off.<br/><br/>Maybe the worse show I have ever scene all the actors are horrible and the characters are unlikeable. Snarly humor mixed with no emotion= no care for the characters life and that goes for every sitcom but BBT takes it to a whole new level.<br/><br/>The jokes are terrible and the geek/science stuff does not exist anymore.<br/><br/>They need to stop the show before it starts to grate on people or amp up the writing. I was just watching the first season again and realized how much better it is than the current show. I think they've really dumbed it down. The characters were developed well and they used a lot of science related humor from the beginning. As someone married to a nerd :), I appreciated all the science facts, technology, comic con, and video game references. There are less of those references now and they are more in passing, instead of actually part of the scene. Especially, less of the science and technology facts and explanations and not near as much witty quirkiness in general as in the first few seasons. It seems to be all about relationship drama or lack thereof now. The one super annoying thing about the show from the beginning was the laugh track, and they haven't changed that:(. Still, I would give the first three seasons a 10, but the current show rates at 5 for me. The Big Bang Theory is one of the funniest shows on the air. I hope that the writers strike doesn't hurt its standing in coming back for another season. Sheldon is so quirky and hilarious. Walowitz is just awesome. Leonard and Raj seem to be the only nerds that are close to normal. It is just a great show with great actors. Some people say that BBT doesn't stay true to the nerd, only the stereotype. They must not know any true nerds. They fit the nerd to the T, only funnier. This show is a MUST SEE for anyone who has any sense of humor. There are so many other shows on the air that are pointless and laugh-less, BBT is smart and funny. Plus, the characters are lovable. Just give this show a chance, keep it on the air! It took years for Two and a half men to get a following! But it had the chance! It took years for Seinfeld to get popular. This show could become a classic. Just give it the chance. The first 5 seasons were great, after they added Amy and Bernadette the show took a sharp turn too very boring and unfunny. I can't stand Amy, she's a such a boring character. It has completely killed off Sheldon. Howard used to be funny also. It's now best suited for background noise while you fall asleep. Another show that started great until you realize that they are not laughing with geeks, they are laughing at geeks, or what apple/facebook people think a geek is.<br/><br/>Past the first seasons, it is a standard drama/comedy.
And a guide to consumerism. Speaking of me, that I'm a big BBT fan would be an understatement. I have watched all BBT episodes from last season. Sadly I have to admit this is the first season so far, which didn't make me laugh at all. The authors seem to have run out of fuel to create convincing comical situations. I almost feel like if the producers wanted to discourage me from watching. I'm giving this series a 5 out of 10, but that's not because I don't like it. Quite the contrary: I find the setting and characters to be reasonably creative and the acting is usually quite on-point. No, what bothers me is the fact that this show's humour seems to only come in two forms: great and absolutely horrendous. Almost all the 'jokes' are passive-aggressive jabs by the characters towards each other or lame slapstick. Not that I'm against slapstick or anything, but in certain forms, and if it's repetitive like it is in this show, it gets on my nerves. <br/><br/>But what makes the humour so terrible at times are not the jokes themselves, but rather the unbelievably cringy laughter that they put over it. They put it over everything, even if the pointe of the joke hasn't been said yet. As soon as a character says or does something remotely unusual, they play that dumb laughing audio track over it. Because of this, I have a strong tendency not to laugh, and that's not what a comedy series should be doing. The jokes and their delivery should make me laugh, not the fact that there is audio of other people laughing. <br/><br/>That being said, oftentimes the humour is quite good. Albeit, most funny jokes involve the indisputably best character Sheldon, but from time to time Howard will say something very amusing, and his deep, 'fake-flirtatious' voice makes it even better. This brings me to arguably the funniest thing on the show: Howard and his mother. I don't think I've ever laughed so hard at a sitcom as during the scenes where Howard and his mother 'talk'. Not only is the voice of his mother perfect, but the fact that they never show her adds to it because of the power of imagination. We simply have no idea what she looks like and only have Howard's horrible descriptions of her to go on, which conjures up very disturbing and in turn hilarious images.<br/><br/>I'd like to add some more things I disapprove of. Raj was funny at first, but it really feels like his behaviour is painfully repetitive, and it gets annoying because you almost always know what he's going to say which in turn means I rarely laugh at anything he says. The other thing is Leonard. I don't know if this was deliberate, but he is so f*cking cringy that it's really hard to watch at times. Obviously this was probably intentional, but it's still quite annoying. <br/><br/>All in all, the show has its merits, but ultimately fails in a lot of departments and could be a lot better if they cut down on the unfunny slapstick, repetitive jokes and autistic laughing audio track. ... but the seasons afterwards are terrible. Unfunny, terrible writing and plain boring. If you decide to watch this show, focus on season 1-5. Ignore the rest. I've watched several episodes of this show and quite frankly it's horrible. Not in the least funny whatsoever. In the first five seasons, this show was spectacular. It was original, funny and intelligent. Sheldon was a fabulous creation, initially. However, after season five, the quality of the writing plummeted. Sheldon became too childlike and the science that was once a major factor of the show is now merely part of the background. I was a huge fan of the show originally but I recommend that if you enjoy the first five seasons, don't watch the rest: I guarantee you will be disappointed. (Unless you disliked the science based story lines and Sheldon's self-obsessed attitude - then, you will enjoy the most recent seasons) Early on, the potential was amazing. A show about nerds and their funny idiosyncrasies. Great writing, good characters, and often fabulous acting (Jim Parsons is fantastic). Slowly but steadily the show entered a downward spiral and it's now barely watchable. To me, the proliferation of female characters (even if occasionally funny), and their growing protagonism, killed the show. I blame this show for the decline in quality TV. This show is not funny at all. Nobody I know likes it or watches it. I sometimes wonder if the Nielson ratings are real or do they decide what shows they want to be popular and tell us that a lot of people watch this, how would we know the real ratings? The programs on TV are controlled by Nielsen families and they must be the biggest morons on earth if they find this trash entertaining. This show has no redeeming value whatsoever, it's filled with poor acting, terrible writing and bad jokes. It's just a bunch of annoying nerds in a room that looks like a cheap sound stage. The same people who kept Friends on the air for years must be keeping this garbage going. This is the most hilarious and brilliant sitcom that I have seen. Amidst all the generic and repetitive sitcoms airing today, this one stands out tall! Chuck Lorre and Bill Praddy have created an amazing show which is loved and appreciated world wide and for a good reason. This is one of the few shows that get's better with unlike most others which just deteriorate. Chuck Lorre is an amazing producer and his brilliance is visible in full galore on this show!<br/><br/>The script and dialogs are the bane of the hilarious comedy that this show integrates. The other major part is of the acting. Jim Parsons is the stand out actor of the cast. He is perfect for his almost robotic doctor-cum-geek outfit of Dr. Sheldon Cooper. His dialog delivery is unlike any I have seen while his facial expressions are mind blowing too. Kaley Cuoco also plays her part very well. Another mention would be of course Johny Galecki as Dr. Leonard. Almost the whole cast is up to par.<br/><br/>The plot is actually pretty straight-forward with a few twists at unexpected moments but the plot is not what makes this show great, it's the humor, the dialogs and the environment that it creates. Sure the whole geek image is portrayed a bit over the top but it adds to the charm. <br/><br/>Give it a try once (Season 4 starts in September!) and you will never be able to stop watching it. It's so funny that tears will be running down your cheeks! Fun is guaranteed! Although there was potential and they had hit their stride by season 3 the show decended into an over-confident smugness trading quirky humor for cheap shots and put-downs which became the tone of the show for the remainder of its run. Just because something is popular does not mean its actually good. Shows that employ laugh tracks should be put to pasture. Characters in this show are dull and without any emotion. Jokes are supposed to be sophisticated and for intellectuals and I guess that's why so many people like it. In reality they are dry and not funny at all. This thing never made me laugh, I feel sad for its fame and can´t guess why this thing succeeded. <br/><br/>The girl character is a simple woman.
Sheldon (performed by the untalented JP) looks like an asshole all the time.
His friends are very very ridiculous losers trying to be ......... Still I can´t catch the script idea...........
CHUCK LORRE or Chaim Levy, could hate scientists very much or it´s envy First of all let me say that I really love the show in general, especially the first couple of seasons.<br/><br/>But one has to admit that the main story arc of the show ended in season 8 (at the latest), and that was "will Penny (the hot girl) and Leonard (the nerd) end up together". And we are stuck ever since.<br/><br/>You can clearly see they don't know what to to with both of the characters anymore, breaking them up again would upset everyone, as it would be more of the same all over again, but otherwise they have no story at all anymore, which is the case at the moment.<br/><br/>Same goes for Howard and Bernadette, yes the were able to pull some obvious jokes off regarding them having a baby, but that's sitcom 101, basically their story has come to an end too, and is super boring.<br/><br/>And don't get me even started on Raj, such an annoying story line, what an annoying character he has become, and what a really bad actor Kunal Nayyar is (sorry but it's true), they should get rid of his character asap.<br/><br/>Only Amy and Sheldon are still at some level able to remind you of the good old days when this show used to be super funny.<br/><br/>I'm rather sad to hear that they already announced a season 12!, yeah money makes the world go round, it's a cash cow for everyone, especially the actors, as they make a real fortune out of it.<br/><br/>But I'm very much afraid we are on our way to the late Two And a Half Man, this show deserved better, but I guess that's just the fate of all of Cuck Lorre's shows in the end. This show is getting worst everyday. Not only is like an encyclopedia of what a man should behave or BE to be loved by a ****** woman (like Raj being disemboweled by his ex-girlfriends and by his friends after that, because things like: women don't like men who are so sensible or who don't have their own money. Very ****** and materialistic (smart women should noticed this insulting thesis, by the way), but this show never would even speak about what a woman should be to a man, as well. No, please, that would be so insulting sexist, (not the opposite, of course). In fact, it's inconsistent even to express that ****** ideas, like the muted ex-girlfriend of Raj who gave up with him because disillusioned because he did't want to depend on his father riches (please, at least review your OWN show), and then they, in a group of ****** and problematic girls and friends, criticizes him for the opposite (for being dependent of his father's money). I liked this show when it told about a group of funny geeks, not another ****** show about ****** relationships between ****** people who, besides that, they are the worst to instruct any others. To see that, you had also "two men and a guy", you just had that another show to shove all that sh** up it's audience ***. This show is begging to be slaughtered. too. first of all let me say that for about 8 seasons this was the best comedy series on air and certainly one of the best of all time. then in series nine it started to fade, too much Sheldon, who is now just a bore, howerd and bernadette have become very nasty, Raj, has become a boring camping nothing, the shows are now all about their relationships and it verges on being a soap, gone are all the nerd elements the comic and film and TV references, the fun basically, it is far too serious. the writing is really lame now, the jokes mostly not funny. what were once beloved characters with original twisty and tics, are now domesticated bores. either pick up the pace or let the thing die This is the most overrated series of all time. I "wanted to die" while watching first episode. If I ever laughed, is because it is so freaking stupid. TV Show for smart people? Ha - ha. <br/><br/>But I can see why is it so popular. Because it's made for a lot of people, even stupid ones no matter how old they are. <br/><br/>I recommend this TV show to, well...I don't know what those people are like, they are just, uh... It's an embarrassment for humanity.<br/><br/>Oh, and acting is horrible too, I won't lose my words here, it's just plain 2D acting.. This is my first review, I just had to write this and tell people how bad it is. I was hoping during season 8 that they would get Koothrapalli married off. I also wondered what they were going to do with Stuart and the answer ended up being "nothing". I loved Big Bang's first 8 seasons and then got tired of the long, drawn out dramas surrounding Bernadette and Howard's baby and then Amy and Sheldon's courtship. <br/><br/>Why do TV execs make a series go on until every last dollar of revenue is wrung out? Taxi was the ultimate comedy because it only ran for 5 seasons and there are ZERO superfluous episodes. Now we're besieged with series that go 10 or 12 seasons with the last half dozen seasons being colossal bores. <br/><br/>TV in general is now like professional athletes who retire 5 years past their peak. WARNER BROS. HAS PLAGIARIZED MY HYPOTHESIS. Hello to all fans of "The Big Bang Theory". I write here because this series has been plagiarized one of my hypothesis, contained in one of my scientific articles published online.Indeed, WB has plagiarized in his series "The Big Bang Theory" a hypothesis contained in one of my articles of scientific divulging published in Internet. My article's tittle "Is the unconscious a gossip-monger who"sings"our secrets?" was put on the web 8 months ago. Now it can be found on the Internet at the following addresses: https://www.linkedin.com/grp/post/5035262-6002890047068651524 I have written to Warner Bros. without solution. This is not a show about nerds. Nerds today are the populous (Star Wars) and own a piece of the culture equal to that of sports fans or politics (sad?). This a show is about a what someone thought nerds were in 1990. This show is safe, well trod sanitized sitcom territory. If you grew up in the 80's like myself you have seen this show ad nauseum. A half hour situation "comedy" has static characters episodically face a contrived situation and humorously resolve it with a possible moral lesson attached. The main issue is that sitcoms have evolved since this formula hits its peak arguably with "All in the Family" or later with "Diff'rent Strokes". Not that "diff'rent Strokes" was anywhere near the achievement "All in the Family" was just that the formula was more accepted and popular at the time. Maybe the Apex was "Friends", God help us if thats true but I digress. Modern situation comedies have seasonal arcs (Arrested Development), Nuanced character growth (Simpsons), Dark Absurd logic (It's Always Sunny)usually devoid of a moral or replacing the expected parable with the subversive twist (looking at you Southpark). If you understand what I am saying this show won't appeal to you. If you long for a simpler time or the perception of one you might enjoy this tripe. If off color language and sexual innuendo upset your gooey moral center you might enjoy this offal. If you wish Seventh Heaven had a laugh track this is the show for you! Sci-fi, fantasy, RPGs, etc.. create consuming, intricate worlds and a large part of the earths populace now enjoy them as a form of escapism and as platform for discussing complex contemporary issues. The devotees of these genres are more numerous and diverse then ever (GoT). Boiling this demographic down to a one dimensional stereotypes would be insulting if this show wasn't so completely banal and unworthy of further discussion. This review allows a maximum of 1000 words. A thousand words cannot describe how awful this sitcom is. After watching seasons 1 and 2, i can see how many people have come to like this show. It appeals to a certain crowd of people who have poor taste in television. The show tries so hard to be smart and witty but fails miserably. The laugh track makes me want to take a gun to my head, and to top it all off the characters are very annoying. I cannot stand this show, every time a "smart" joke is forced, i want to punch a baby. Yes i have stopped watching, and the only reason i continued to watch in the first place was because i thought the show had potential. The formula was excellent, but everything else fell below average. If you want to watch a real comedy try a show like Community or Parks and Recreation. Community for example is a show FOR smart people, whereas The Big Bang Theory is simply a show ABOUT smart people. Just in my personal opinion. I really really love this show. I started watching it in Jan 2010 when my uncle gave me a DVD of it, and boy was I hooked! The humour just flows and there is not a dull moment in a single episode.<br/><br/>What I really like about TBBT is that it has quite a few golden scenes that you can watch over and over again. Case in point - Sheldon and Penny singing "Soft Kitty", Sheldon with a dreamy voice, while Penny is looking at him with gritted teeth. Or when Sheldon is overcome on receiving Leonard Nimoy's DNA. Or when Penny asks,"What do you guys do for fun?", Sheldon says,"Well, some time back we tried masturbating for money". Or Leonard's fruitless pursuit of Sheldon in the ball pit. Or...I can go on :)<br/><br/>Also, what really made me love this show is that I can totally relate to the geeky protagonists. I am a science nerd myself, and every time I see a joke or a gag, I find myself thinking,"That could have been me!"<br/><br/>Bottomline - This is a great, fresh show with boundless potential for more humour, and I really hope it is on air for a sizable amount of time to come. This show is atrocious. From the choppy script writing to the predictable and tedious plot lines. Not one redeeming feature lay present with this horrid sitcom. It is everything that has been wrong with American comedy for the last 10 - 15 years and by that I mean this sitcom is the same as most of the others. The jokes are obvious, immature and annoying because you know the punchlines before the jokes are said and you know the outcome before the situation begins. <br/><br/>The horrid tedium that normally ends up making these shows mediocre at worst and average at best is present on The Big Bang Theory but for some reason with this show it makes it offensively bad instead of averagely mediocre. The show is childish and unoriginal on almost every level and for some reason other comments are saying this is smart and well written. Well written? ARE YOU JOKING?<br/><br/>The "hilarious" situations the characters find themselves in are always surrounding the one idea that these guys are geeks and although yes it can be done well to have a show about socially awkward people(see Peep Show) the idea alone of them being geeks is not enough to make a show funny.<br/><br/>WE GET IT THEY ARE GEEKS WHO AREN'T GOOD WITH LADIES!!! But do you have any other jokes? Any at all? No of course not, just more "HA hes so nerdy scenes" Everything about the sitcom elements of The Big Bang Theory has been done a million times before and a million times better. Something this bland wouldn't even feel original if it was shown twenty years ago. This canned laughter bullsh*t is old and its done so please just let it die. <br/><br/>Also I am confused to why some people think this show is made better by the fact they have science researchers on board the production staff. So what the silly experiments the characters get into could actually be done? Right well that doesn't make what is supposedly a sitcom funny. If I wanted stupid but real science I would watch Brainiac NOT A F*CKING SITCOM ITS SIMPLE!<br/><br/>Look how ever much I rate this down and rant angrily about how terrible show you have probably made your mind up about the show but here is how I see it. <br/><br/>If you like your comedy predictable, dull and with a million quotable and "Hilarious" catchphrases then get this as soon as possible because you will certainly love this. <br/><br/>IF HOWEVER YOU ARE NOT A COMPLETE AND UTTER DRIBBLING INVALID THEN STAY WELL AWAY. Try an original American sitcom like Arrested Development or a brilliantly observant British comedy like Peep Show. There is a difference between writing brilliant characters and writing ABOUT brilliant characters. The Big Bang Theory is an unintelligent show about intelligent people who lean on irrelevant (and often inaccurate) science clichés to describe some unrealistic social faux pas. You've heard funnier jokes and more knowledgeable banter at your grandmother's house. Anyone interested in quantum mechanics would laugh at a theoretical physicist who actually takes an intentional farce like Schrodinger's Cat so seriously. I'm not nitpicking either, it becomes rather itchy when you constantly hear a dimwit writer's take on a smart concept and the audience rejoices, "Hurrah! A comedy for us smarts!"<br/><br/>E=MC2? Idolizing Darwin and Star Trek? "Coitus"? "What is football?" Is it me or does this show seem a bit dated, if not completely predictable? It's as if the writing staff Googled "Smart things" or "What Do Nerds Like?" and copy/pasted 23 minutes worth into a script. In fact, that right there could have easily been a highlight joke from the show.<br/><br/>If not painfully predictable, the jokes are... well, virtually nonexistent. Here's an example: Leonard says to Penny, walking in with her pee-brained ex-boyfriend, "Oh hey, so you and Zack again?" indicating their status together, to which Zack replies "Huh? Were we here earlier?" I kid you not, the laugh track activated indicating that was a legitimate joke. Of course, though, it does push the creative envelope by implying one of the nerds wears Spiderman underpants. Yes, once again, "Hurrah! A comedy for us smarts!" The show relies almost entirely on nerdy ambiance, grammar-correcting jokes (seriously?), a funny-talky Indian man (prompting all us Americans to giggle) and the same four jokes - I mean characters. Sheldon is literal and habitual. Leonard is annoyed with Sheldon. Howard is a Jewish momma's boy. Raj is Indian. Dress them in superhero costumes, have them insult each other feeling forced to mention something scientific, and say things like Large Hadron Collider - ta dah! You have a hit series. <br/><br/>There is nothing to like about any of the main characters, they all put on a charade and shamelessly play on their overdone traits so much that it becomes hard to care if they become heartbroken or successful in the given plot. They show about as much heart and ambition as a piece of driftwood. I originally thought the show's theme was to make likable, funny geeks. Big Bang ends up creating shallow, one-dimensional, selfish people who occasionally fall into doing normal things - and we're supposed to think that as outrageous. <br/><br/>Big Bang makes it unattractive to be smart and shallow to be a thinker. Chuck Lorre once again cashes in on exercising punchlines you've heard from your middle school days, shameless stereotypes, scientific words for "penis" or "sex", and banal plots that become a battleground for embarrassingly misconstrued scientific notions. Lastly, "Hurrah! A show for us smarts!" I still can't believe something like this even exists. Don't get me wrong, I'm not one to hate something just because it's popular, I'm a big fan of Quentin Tarantino and I even have a Facebook account, so I'm all for the "mainsteam" aspect of things, but this show is garbage. Pure trash. I'm not going to waste my time telling you how much I dislike/hate this show, but just know that the creator is afterbirth, the stars are cancer and the fans of this show shouldn't even be allowed to reproduce. This show is the product of self-destruction, it's the start of something bad, and believe me folks, oh believe me, it's gonna get a whole lot worse now that this sort of stuff is becoming increasingly popular by the hour, just look at the Marvel movies. Mods please approve this review for the sake of humanity.<br/><br/>BAZINGA!!! The END Is NEAR... <br/><br/>So, they brought in a new character to date Amy name Dave yes, it's true and we all know what that means! <br/><br/>The writers have given up!!<br/><br/>You know a TV show or movie has had lazy writers when they break out the name Dave for a character. It's also a good sign of when parents don't love their kids or just don't love them enough to give them a real name. <br/><br/>PROJECT ----> Go into any department store, or better yet a Walmart and page the name David to come to the red courtesy phone. Guaranteed no less than 5 goobers, some even with some type of cameo clothing on will show up thinking the phone's for them. That's how overused the name is, especially in the rural places in America. So if the writers are too lazy to spend a couple of seconds to give their characters a proper name, then they're too lazy to write a good script. <br/><br/>Do yourself a favor change the channel or leave the theater as soon as you hear the first sign of a lazy writer who just mailed it in. Big Bang Season 9 R.I.P. I'll see you in the reruns... As long as it's not reruns of season 9 i got the DVD last month and since then i have only watched 3 episodes. and they are like torture, i felt like breaking my TV. how this falls under comedy i don't know?<br/><br/>the laughter starts at even the stupidest line ever like ' have you seen my microscope?' hahahahahahaa<br/><br/>the comments here are the most biased i have ever seen, you cant compare this to friends. go watch a real comedy eg office, entourage,scrubs. extras worst week the British version<br/><br/>THIS SHOW IS SO IRRITATING, AND RATHER WATCH SEASEME STREET, ANY THING ELSE EVEN AN EDUC ATONAL DOCUMENTARY I regularly watch "The Big Bang Theory" with my son who is currently home from college for the summer. The great thing about it is that I am a classic geek and he is anything but, but we both find the show hilarious. I sometimes have to explain the geekier references (as for instance when the gang tried to convince Sheldon that he is a robot by pointing out that he never violates rules 1 and 3 of the Three Laws of Robotics), but the balance of geeky & non-geeky humor is such that everyone can enjoy it.<br/><br/>I think that this fact alone makes it an outstanding show.<br/><br/>The writing is excellent. The cast is is also. The three main characters (Sheldon, Leonard, and Penny) quickly make you care about them. Being from Texas, I especially enjoy the "Texas trailer-park" background that they've given to Sheldon, with its references to moon-pies and the house coming off the cinder blocks. Raj and Wolowitz are less well developed, but there's time to correct that - the show has been renewed. I hope for many more seasons. Seriously, this is the first sitcom I have ever watched entirely during the run. A lot of my other favorite sitcoms have either been off the air for years, or got cancelled after a few episodes. And it's the funniest one I've seen since "The Nanny," another CBS sitcom that aired in the 90s, starring Fran Drescher. The Big Bang Theory is a show about two physicists who work at Caltech University named Leonard (Johnny Galecki) and Sheldon (Jim Parsons) and their two friends Howard Wolowitz (Simon Helberg) and Raj Koothrappali (Kunal Nayyar). Lenny and Shelly live across the hall from Penny (Kaley Cuoco), a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory and an unsuccessful actress. The four guys, although geeks try to adapt to everyday life and social situations. My favorite characters are Sheldon and Howard. I love when Sheldon has his little quirks and OCD traits (he can't sit anywhere else except his spot, Thursday is Tai food night) and when he blurts out really long equations and scientific facts. (How in the name of ground beef does Jim Parsons memorize them on top of his other lines? I would need cue cards!) Howard is also hysterical too--I liked when he would do his imitations during the first season, when he would imitate Steven Hawking's computer voice, pretend to be Raj over the phone (LOL!) and also pretending to be his MUTHA over the phone as well. I wonder if he ever will get a girlfriend? I like Leonard and Raj but I think Howard and Sheldon are funnier. Actually Sheldon is my absolute favorite character as he has had a lot of hysterical lines. ("I could be Batman! *deep raspy voice* I'M BATMAN! *normal voice* see?") just to name one, also when he was the Doppler Effect for Halloween (NEEEEEEEEUM!) and in the one where he cleaned Penny's apartment in the middle of the night (deep voice) "if you have time to lean, you have time to clean!" LOL. Also, "oh gravity thou art a heartless bitch," and one of the most famous from the Christmas special, "all I need is my own healthy ovum and I can grow my own Leonard Nemoy!" I don't think that they stereotype geeks that bad but I've never really ever met a person like that before--but it's just innocent wacky comedy. I love when Sheldon does his knock (knock knock knock "Penny?" knock knock knock "Penny?") <br/><br/>To sum it all up, this is an awesome and innocent sitcom. The jokes are actually FUNNY and it doesn't heavily involve sex and other clichés like most sitcoms nowadays do. I really like all the references to pop culture and all the things geeky people like to do--play video games, go online, read comics, etc. I like to think of it as this century's Golden Girls--there are a few differences--one of which is on the Golden Girls there were four main characters, not 5, they were all middle-aged (50s and 60s), Dorothy had her mom living with her as a roommate, (Howard does still live with his mom) they didn't have a sexy neighbor, and they all lived together as roommates. The characters are basically the same--Leonard is like Dorothy, Howard is like Blanche, Sheldon is the total opposite of Rose and Raj . . . hmmm. Plus on The Golden Girls, their main food was cheesecake, and on this show their main food is Tai food (or Chinese food) <br/><br/>Watch this show and you may learn a thing or two about physics or any other science. If it's so "stupid" like a lot of other people say it is, then how come it's been getting really high ratings? I know people have opinions but they don't know real clean comedy. Based on the show's unbelievable ratings, I think The Big Bang Theory will be around for many years. 8.5/10! I have never seen a TV show so undeserving of a rating above an 8.0. "The Big Bang Theory" is humor for people who don't like to think. Recycled jokes, overused laugh tracks - it's the perfect show for those with an IQ under 100.<br/><br/>There is little to no character development (by the way, the characters are not very likable, ESPECIALLY Sheldon. One of the most annoying characters in a movie or TV show...ever.) <br/><br/>I honestly despise this show and its popularity. How does it have an 8.6? IMDb is better than that. <br/><br/>I suggest people check out "Louie", "It's Always Sunny in Philly", or the original "Office". That is humor, and smart humor at that! None of this recycled humor that literally insults the average person's intelligence. Sit-coms are with a few exceptions on the whole pretty bad but even among the bad ones this is one real stinker.<br/><br/>What can one say ? Boring, badly written, cringe worthy 'jokes' that hardly qualify as jokes and did literally make me cringe. Obviously written for morons with five seconds attention span.<br/><br/>Should never have been commissioned.<br/><br/>The best thing for the series ? ...Show it at Guantanamo Bay as interrogation torture.<br/><br/>Make it stop ...please make it stop. I cringe every time I see a commercial for this show. The punchlines are never funny and feel so obviously forced. Nothing about this show and it's awful dialogue is enjoyable. When a long running series starts having guest stars of varying degrees of fame and notoriety, you know they know their days are numbered. The last time I actually laughed at this show was Amy doing her Riverdance and Sheldon's response. In fact they are the only two characters that still have possibilities of humour but recently even their dialogue has been predictable.
Obviously the show is running out of story lines or any kind of character development. Stuart is wasted and the other characters keep running around the same hoop. Penny's character went down hill when we were asked to believe she could possibly pronounce any drug as a pharmaceutical sales rep. None of the males have matured. Koothrapali hasn't had anything to do in years.
I guess we'll have to wait until the wedding...but even that is loaded with "guests" which kinda indicates the producers don't even have faith in their own scripts. All they really need is Bob Newhart to make an appearance. Then we'd at least have a good chuckle. Ever since the first episode this show has had me laughing and enjoying every minute. <br/><br/>The cast works so well with each other that this has become my all-time favourite show! I look forward to seeing what else this show can bring to the table! The big bang theory is absolutely hilarious!!! The comedic timing is perfect and always spot on and the chemistry between the characters is mesmerising. I have been waiting so long for the new series to come out, it finally has now and i can't get enough of it!<br/><br/>If you haven't watched this show, i would definitely recommend it!!! There is a lack of good comedy shows these days but this is so refreshing to watch! I think that Jim Parsons does an outstanding job as Sheldon, although i like all the characters his sarcasm and scientific lectures make me laugh every time. Thank you E4 for airing this show it is absolutely AMAZING !!!!<br/><br/>10/10 !!! I have watched every episodes since the pilot and it keeps getting better and better.<br/><br/>The cast is all set in and now the writers can make out great lines on each character like in last weeks episode..Leonard says..."Sheldon is one lab accident away from been a super villain" that was hilarious.<br/><br/>The cast is really talented, I don't know how Sheldon remembers all his lines in one go, that too in front of live studio audience. I mean some of his lines are straight out of science and he remembers and says it all flawlessly.<br/><br/>Hope the best for the BB crew...keep it coming. :o) What can I say? Lazily written, poorly directed and relying too much on forced laughter and the negative stereotypes of nerds. <br/><br/>The show follows the lives of four (extra)ordinary nerds on their daily abode. Witness the hysterical shenanigans that follow as completely implausible scenarios such as Sheldon's refusal of social rehabilitation and a Korean child's intellectual capabilities somehow overshadow and push into recluse a twenty year old something. <br/><br/>Now, allow me to make an additional point, people should not like this on the basis that is a vaguely intelligent program This show is merely an excuse to shine another pointless additional light to the ongoing sitcom disease that is plaguing us all. You want to pretend to like that crap? Be my guest. But do so on your own intellectual risk. <br/><br/>In short: the success of this program is simply absurd. This is one of the only shows that keeps me watching the CBS network at all. I am anxiously awaiting the end of the writers strike to get the next part of the season, give the writers more money already! The ones that write shows like this deserve it!<br/><br/>Without being redundant to the positive comments listed in other reviews I agree with most of them!<br/><br/>Personally I don't think the behavior of the "nerds" and the "regulars" are exaggerated. They are portraying the extreme 2 sides of the spectrum between book smarts (IQ) and social smarts (Emotional Intelligence) I knew people that represented both of these stereotypes when I was in college and beyond. Leonard seems to be somewhere in the middle, understanding more of the social rules than Sheldon, but not comfortable in Penny's world either.<br/><br/>I think it would be a lot of fun if Sheldon found a semi-permanent girlfriend!<br/><br/>**** Spoilers **** I also think this show is equally appealing to those who understand all the science jokes and those that do not. You don't have to know exactly what the Doppler effect is to think that Sheldon dressed as what many people would think was a zebra going EEEEeeeeerrrrrmmmm loudly multiple times at a costume party is funny!<br/><br/>My favorite part hands down was when Penny was putting together her entertainment center and was 3/4 of the way done by the time the guys laid out the plans to set up heat-sinks and fans and went to get supplies (titanium ?) to implement the plan. They had ruled out water cooling I believe. How does this show keep getting renewed?? I'm not one to hate. I'm happy for anyone to get money, But their are only two characters in this show who are not completely annoying: Penny and Leonard, the times I've watched this show I feel bad for them having to put up with their "special" friends, and it was bad enough when it was just the four original nerds then they added the two female ones, wow, just what the show needed. I wonder if the people in this show actually like it? The day this show ends I'll be as happy as an AIDS patient with a cure. I have watched Friends. It was pleasant it shows how friendship is. It is very beautiful. But this not sure from where director got such an idea. It is so annoying am not able to see. This Sheldon character especially it is so annoying am getting angry when I see him the way he speaks. What is the joke in it. I saw one's comment saying that he wants to slap him. I literally feel the same way. <br/><br/>Only good thing in this series is the girl character.<br/><br/>However, because of other characters which I personally call a big pile of crap over shadows her. Nothing good about this series. My rating a big zero 0.. When The Big Bang Theory premiered three years ago, I was certainly skeptical since it came from the creators of Two and A Half-Men (one of the worst comedies on TV ever). However, since then, it has proved to be one of the best comedies on Television.<br/><br/>The ensemble cast is amazing, quite amazing in every way. Johnny Galecki is a true comedy lead star, and Kaley Cuoco has gotten better since her 8 Simple Rules days. However, as great as the cast is, the shining star here is Jim Parsons. He has created one of the funniest, most obscure and interesting characters I have ever seen in a sitcom, thanks in large part to the writing and to his magnificent portrayal. It is evident that he holds the show together.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a very likable comedy series, that while it started off so-so, has gotten better and better and has proved it's greatness over the years. It was good till about season 8. i feel like this show will never end, thank god were on the last season. The current episode plots are dull, nothing much happens anymore, no more comic-cons, no more Star Wars/Star Trek episodes, no more going to a new movie.... BORING !!! Predictable dull and out of ideas. Mind numbing and a waste of 23 minutes of your life. Should have ended many seasons ago. Loved this show at the beginning, really sharp writing and acted very well however the later series are really not good, the writing is laboured, the same jokes are regurgitated and the show seems to have completely lost its charm. I will continue to watch until the end as I've been there since the beginning and I want to know how it's tied up, however watching now has become somewhat of a chore sadly The Big Bang Theory will always be a classic. Although the plot has changed a bit through the years since the pilot episode, it maintains its appeal. The characters origins are embraced and over the years have had ample time to develop. And although the show began with just 4 scientists and a pretty girl next door, the show has evolved to include 2 female scientists, one who has a phd in real life. The actual science that is showcased in the show is verified by real scientists. The scientists that are discussed in the show are either directly or indirectly referring to real scientists, nobel prize winners and other people of note. The conversations that they have about comic books are usually references to real comic books or characters. They even refer to certain technology figures who are either mentioned or appear on the show. And although the premace has changed over the years, their use of real knowledge and educational tid bits will ensure that this show has a legacy for others to enjoy through the ages. I only wish it wasn't ending! I appreciate the "scientific themed" idea for a sitcom - but the nerd factor, stupid jokes and painful laugh-track is way over-the-top for me. It's too much so, that it's annoying. ALL CHARACTERS ARE ANNOYING AF. More 'cringing' than 'laughing'. If it wasn't targeting stupid teenagers, it *could have* been a good series for me. I wouldn't even bother writing this, but it's airing on every TV channel that airs sitcoms. The series is over - Go away.
-end rant. I previously stated before that Two and a Half Men is the most unfunny show I've ever seen.
I take back what I said because I forgot that this monstrosity existed. In what could possibly be the most annoying and humorless shows concocted, we're introduced to a dorm full of stuck up "geniuses" who "joke" about science and popular culture while also "joking" about sex. The problem is that the jokes simply aren't funny and the characters are also very annoying and condescending, especially that of Sheldon. I sat through three episodes with my cousins. I sat there stone cold , nary a slight smile appeared on my face nor a chuckle uttered out of my mouth. I have no idea how this show got a fan base.<br/><br/><br/><br/>F- (yes, I know F- isn't an actual grade, but I hate this show enough for it be rewarded an F-). This show annoys the hell out of me. I know its an unpopular opinion but this show is overrated af. I feel like they only try to appeal to (creepy) male geeks sense most of the main characters (except Leonard) are jerks. Sheldon's the most annoying out of all of them, but he didnt have to be. If you took the laugh track out of this show nobody would watch it. The actors are fine, but the writers of this show suck. I'll be honest, the first 2 seasons are watchable garbage. Meaning there's no substance to the show---no in depth plot or good character development---but it's entertaining to watch. After that, with the introduction of Amy Farrah Fowler and Bernadette, the show goes from watchable garbage to just garbage. And in the past few seasons(I'm writing this in January 2018 for reference) it has become painfully insufferable to watch,<br/><br/>The show doesn't really have interesting events or scenarios. It is mostly Sheldon saying/doing something against social code, followed by laugh track, followed by Leonard pointing out how ridiculous Sheldon is, followed by laugh track, followed by Penny walking in, followed by laugh track, followed by Leonard hitting on Penny, followed by laugh track, followed by a never ending supply of horrible, not funny sex jokes, often told by Howard(though not limited to him), followed by laugh track, followed by Raj whining about how miserable his life is, followed by laugh track. Sometimes there will be just awkward silence followed by laugh track. <br/><br/>You know when you're flipping through channels on tv, and you can always hear a brief second of sound of each channel before going up to the next channel? Well, 9/10 times when I land on Big Bang Theory, the sound is laugh track. Try it yourself. Wait for Big Bang Theory to come on, then go to that channel, then hit the last button on your remote, and then keep doing this. And 9/10 times that brief moment of sound you'll get when landing on Big Bang Theory is laugh track.<br/><br/>But while punishing those whose only crime was going to a live screening of a tv show in the 50s, only to have their laugh recorded, and now spend eternity being forced to laugh at not funny things, such as, but not limited to this show(The Big Bang Theory), there are other things that make this show insufferable, such as how it tries to teach us horribly wrong things such as:
-all pretty girls are dumb sluts
-all smart girls are ugly and completely devoid of social skills
-girls in comic book stores is a rarity
-nerdy girls dress in clothes that haven't been in style since 1910
-nerds only study science
-smart people hate average intelligent people<br/><br/>Then other parts of the show don't make sense. Like would a guy like Sheldon, who's so anal about food to put his cereal in order of fiber content, consume the ever feared chemical aspartame which in his beloved diet Coke?
Leonard and Penny would never be a couple in real life, because they have zero common interests, and both would be bored being with the other. And Howard is a creep and probably would've landed a sexual harassment lawsuit, or at least been fired from his job for being so perverse towards women.<br/><br/>But in the end, the people who were born the year Big Bang Theory came out are now in grade 5. The show has run it course, and really ought to be cancelled. I love 'The Big Bang Theory' so much! I can't tell you how many times I've watched and re-watched the series. I can't get enough! My favourite character has got to be Howard Wolowitz. Every line of his is hilarious. I just love the wittiness of every single character and the way all of their lives intertwine is brilliant. So perfectly written and the cast is amazing! When this show first debuted on CBS in the fall of 2007, no one would expect it to be the juggernaut it is today, even though if the hype has fallen due to the rise of internet TV. The cast is great, and the humor is there, even though the laugh track is kinda annoying. Fans of comic books and the movies and TV shows that inspire it as well as home theater geeks will love this show. The theme song by Barenaked Ladies is very quirky and fun. Thanks in part to syndication and cable reruns, this show has become the Simpsons of sitcom TV!!!! The title for this review is basically all you need to judge this show. I find it hard to see why people like it so much. Yes occasionally they make a funny joke. But the times are few and you really don't have to be clever to understand their comedy. It is an insult to the viewers intelligence . The people who watch this only watched it because it looked like another comedy programme on comedy central, but the people who watched it found it slightly funnier than the average crap on TV and started blowing it out of proportion.It's just my opinion. Here is an example of one of this shows jokes.<br/><br/>Raj: Sheldon is using psychological warfare. We must reply in kind. I say we wait until he looks at us, then laugh like "Yes, you're a smart and strong competitor, but, we are also smart and strong, and we have a reasonable chance of defeating you!"<br/><br/>Leonard: How exactly would that laugh go?<br/><br/>Raj: Eee hee hee hee hee heeeeee!<br/><br/>Howard: That sounds more like we are a tall thin woman who wants to make a coat out of your Dalmatians.<br/><br/>I personally don't find it funny. I think most people would agree. If that joke was in Two and a half men it would be considered terrible. All i'm saying is that there are better comedy programmes out there, and that this one has be blown out of proportion to how funny it is. Hilarious sitcom that displays the real life of nerds and so called geeks...but only funnier.<br/><br/>The most funny and attractive feature of this show is that this is truly how these kind of boys behave, act, and even live. When you mix people like these with a snobby, sexy girl; funny things can occur.<br/><br/>The jokes are really funny taking in account that most are oriented for sub-plots that deal with computers, video games, cult t.v. series, and most of all, anti-social behavior.<br/><br/>Sheldon is by far the most funny character who delivers quirky, selfish situations that are truly hilarious.<br/><br/>Every character has a distinctive characteristic: Penny is sexy, cool, but clever and mature. Raj is anti-social, doesn't speak to women but it's a great supporting character, Leonard is the lead character that delivers the equilibrium to Sheldon's arrogant behavior and Penny's extreme snobby antics. Holowitz is the horny geek that delivers the best sex jokes.<br/><br/>Overall this is a great sitcom that should last for a few more seasons in order to gain a cult status. If not, it will become a huge hit and a commercial program. I have no idea how this horrid show has such a high rating on here. I've seen dozens of episodes and I've laughed maybe one or two times. The show is like a wannabe IT Crowd with none of the humor but all of the awkwardness. Laugh tracks stopped being cool in the '90's, but I don't think the creators of this show got the memo. This is probably the worst well liked show ever, it makes Glee look like Breaking Bad. Jim Parsons is unbearably annoying in role as 'quirky' Sheldon Cooper. The rest of this cast is about as note worthy as a brick wall. If you want to watch an interesting and intellectual comedy, look elsewhere. If you want to watch a cringe-worthy show with Hollywood nerds, then here it is. All my life I have had to sit patiently around waiting for other people to catch up with my brain processes. Both my sons and my husband have the same problem so we can certainly identify with the guys on "Big Bang Theory". We don't normally watch sitcoms because for the most part they are stupid, unimaginative and obviously aimed at the people who have little brain and are entertained as easily as chimpanzees. This show is the exception and my whole family enjoys "Big Bang Theory" as we have all been in similar situations. While Penny seems to be the stereo-typical dumb blonde(a stereo-type no one in our family believes), she has a certain savvy that has totally slid right under Leonard and Sheldon's high-tech minded radar. Only a totally blind person would have missed the sly smile she had on her face when Leonard told her it hadn't worked out with Leslie. If she's smart enough to have the hots for a smart guy like Leonard, she can't be as ignorant as the writers portrayed her in the first episode. I just wish they didn't make the guys all seem so totally desperate. I know there are people in the world who are that desperate, but very few of them have an IQ as high as these guys are supposed to have. Other than that, it's a great show! Must mention i was pointed into this show after "Two and half men" which i consider a real success.<br/><br/>What does this show need ? Pretty much everything. Some real plot, script, characters with profile, personality and social background, less "wanna impress" language that doesn't deliver (considering that language should be the first source of humor) - less pretentiousness, less stereotypes sarcasm is merely nonexistent, the situations are clearly fictional. The characters appear as a cheap joke at a funeral. The scrientific explanations are pushed beyond the obvious, becoming somewhat boring and causing a "yawn" every now and then.The serial fails at making people identify with and become emotionally attached to.Nothing is credible, but everything was clearly pushed too far for marketing purposes. This is a "what to avoid in a movie" kind of series.<br/><br/>The rating i've given is too high for this. Do yourself a favor and Skip it. The worst show I've seen in a long time. I laughed maybe twice ever. The chemistry is terrible. The "cheerleader" blond would be the worst actor ever if it wasn't for the "nerds". Diametric opposites with absolutely nothing to bridge the gap.<br/><br/>It's supposed to be a light hearted comedy, but misses the mark by miles. I want to laugh, and "geekdom" is a great vehicle for some very clever comedy. Too bad there is none in this show. The writers need to be funny, not preachy. Preaching against preaching. Worst writing and delivery ever.<br/><br/>I really feel sorry for any really intelligent person having to sit through 21 minutes of this garbage. Felt sad and emotional as it ends.Then after 10 minutes I went back to first episode of season one and here I am laughing again. This has to be for me a wonderful and fulfilling series I have watched, myself and my partner enjoyed watching this series and was sad when it ended but loved every minute. I have been watching TBBT since last year. I don't watch a lot of sitcoms or even web series. However, TBBT is an exceptional sitcom. I have never been hooked up to such an entertaining program. I still cry every time I see season 12's last episode. I don't understand why they ended the show. Till date I am mad at the production company. BBT was the first ever tv show that I watched which was recommended by a friend of mine . Once you start watching it there is no turning back . Each an every episode is individually funny in its on ways . Definitely worth the watch ! This is my favorite show of all time surpassing even the likes of breaking bad, got, band of brothers, etc. It just always puts a smile on my face, and that's what matters. Whenever I'm feeling down I can always go back to TBBT and realize that not everything in the world is bad. Penny, Sheldon, Leonard, Raj, and Howard. There are none like you. After watching the finale I have so many emotions. This is how you end a show. Sheldon's transformation was a big subject this season. That also lead to tears as he made his acceptance speech whici was by far the most heartfelt moment in twelve seasons. The Big Bang Theory ends with a bang. My wife and me love the show!!! I cant stop watching and i wont stop watching all the seasons again and again From the first episode i knew i was gonna love it and i was right. This show is funny you cant get bored of it. You need to watch it The first seasons were pure gold, after 7th season though, there was a little quality fall, but in the end it is once again perfect and redeeming. 10/10 would watch again This show was hilarious at first. until it moved away from nerd comedy and divulged into a relationship drama with additional cast members that are significantly less funny than the originals. early seasons are probably 8/10. middles closer to 7. with a steady decline.<br/><br/>season 10: 5/10
meh. i'd probably stop watching if it was't a show i've liked for so long (1 viewing)<br/><br/>season 11: 6/10 (1 viewing)
season 12: 5/10 eh (1 viewing) Among the time of our lifes the director of the big bang theory, invited us into a beautiful, funny, intelligent and simply normal daily's journey of 7 brilliants and uniques friends that we've learn to love in every single aspect of their being until the end... making us participate in the grown up process of every chatacter, professional and personal in their lifes driving us into a great and well thinked end of the story, giving us huge learnings and lessons to applied in ourselves. thank you! It's a really great series but Stuart is little creepy and Raj obviously deserves better than any, isn't there anyone in California better looking than any, why did they directors even gave chance to anu I get that it's become a bit of a cliche to hate on The Big Bang Theory, but in the beginning I really did like the show. The early seasons were refreshing comedy the characters and their relationship with each other were well formed and the show had it's own take on nerd culture. The real pitfall of the show was the idea the characters all had to find love, usually that isn't an issue for a show so why is it an issue here?<br/><br/>Rewind to the beginning of the series, the only one who functioned in normal society was Leonard and even then he had a lack of confidence but his relationship with Penny was a part of the series from the beginning which makes their story understandable. But when we look at the other characters, we have Howard who is made out to be repulsive to women and on top of that he isn't made out to be someone who is interested in settling down. Then we have Sheldon who not only is made out to be lacking interpersonal skills, he is also supposedly irritating to even his closest friends and another big joke in the early series was that he had no interest in nor understanding of women. Finally we have Raj, while women tended to show interest in him the most of all the characters he suffered from selective mutism which hindered his relationships in every case early on.<br/><br/>So already the latter seasons backtrack massively on this, but beyond that the show goes from making jokes which were new and original to becoming a formulaic sitcom making ancient jokes about relationships that have been done a thousand times over. It's a double edged sword the change not only made it become just another sitcom it also frustratingly ended a pretty good run. To add insult to injury, Sheldon who was a great character obviously got recognised as a fan favourite and became a caricature. It was apparent they picked up on his popularity and just overloaded the show with an overpowering amount of him to the point were he has his own spinoff. A show with good humour, lots of laughter, teaching life lessons, showing life from almost every persons perspective, well detailed, written and performed. Almost no flaws, consistent characterization. Bonus-good for learning and knowing things, science oriented show... Everything at one place, A must watch and deserve to be atleast 8.7 ratings. Thank you for being true to your characters development over the years and finishing with a BANG!
First started watching it in reruns...and was hooked.
Stayed funny and grew the characters.
Laughed just as much the first season as the last.
Sure my grandchildren will enjoy the reruns too. The fun and emotion that all started with a big bang. The neat and clear conclusion was given to every audience. I am a big fan of sheldon. But at the conclusion with missing of one character we can't imagine the the big bang theory. Kudos to the creator. And a gigantic bow to every actor and actress. Many parts of this show is amusing because of Sheldon's blunt social skills and seemingly autistic tendencies (even if people deny it).<br/><br/>Bernadette's sweet but evil character is hilarious for me many times!! It's also a good delve from the general sweet and short girl. A refreshing change.<br/><br/>Howard is a character I find unbearable most of the times for one particular reason. I'm not comfortable pointing that out. But the stereotype he has been portrayed into is something partly offensive even if it's true on some level and problematic for people who are not like him.<br/><br/>Penny's character as a blonde who's socially smart in getting free drinks is yet again a stereotype which is unfair to blondes who are unlike her. But the fact that she can act and therefore aids Sheldon in his Web series 'Flags' makes him realise that not everyone has to be book smart.<br/><br/>Rajesh Koothrapalli is a ridiculous character on the show. By ridiculous I mean over stereotyped. An Indian boy whose parents look north Indian, whose surname is south Indian, who has servants (child labor), cannot talk to girls without drinking and who always shouts about being brown. All of this may be true but no individual has all of these problems and stereotyping this is problematic for individuals who have to keep convincing that not all Indians act like him. His character is utter disgrace and I wonder why the actor even agreed on performing as Rajesh. He's an astronomer who has better things to do other than lamenting over the failures of his love life. There is no doubt that Big Bang Theory revolves around Sheldon Cooper. Till 6th season it was great to watch his cynical action and his condescending jokes. Jim Parsons did a godly job in playing Brilliant but socially immature Sheldon. He has been efficiently supported by Leonard but since season 8, the story seems to have become stagnant. According to the newest episodes Sheldon has been acting normal that has drained all the comedy out. It seems all the characters have settled and story-line doesn't seem to move in any direction. Season 8 always seems to be the final destination for Chuck Lorre(as with 2 and a half men). I would suggest not to try big bang theory after season 6 as you would not find it funny afterwards.There are better stuff in market- go for those. When i first heard about this sit-com, i thought it to be one of the silly and slappy sit-com.. but all it took me to get ADDICTED to this genius of a show is 3mins of the pilot. i was laughing all over and could not stop repeating the jokes to myself. I m from the science field and every joke the 4 of them say cracks me to the extent that i feel my ribs will crack.. even the episode, which did not have so many jokes, will be rated 9 by me. <br/><br/>i sincerely request the CBS to continue this show and appreciate Bill and Chuck to have comeup with something so BRILLIANT. Cheers for the excellent Cast of TBBT.. every character is deserving of the highest of praises coz non of them are from the science background they do such an amazing job that i could hardly believe it possible to have such excellent performances. <br/><br/>two thumbs up!!! Smart Is The New Sexy - This tag line has to be one of the most interesting ones I've seen. I'm very impressed with this comedy. All 5 characters have very distinct characteristics and preferences that's common yet unique. I enjoyed the realistic exposure of lives led by geeky nerds. Quick wit and sarcastic humor packaged from this comedy is just brilliant! Sheldon is my favorite. His insensitive actions and sarcasm towards real-life issues really amuses me. The funniest scene from him to date was when he broke in to Penny's house to clean! Leonard is your typical geek looking for a lasting relationship with a girl who truly appreciates him despite his awkward social etiquettes. I enjoy Howard's hopeless attempts to impress Penny too. They should have at least canceled it after season 10..but no they still want to ruin this show!! Big bang theory is not funny anymore !! Jokes are not at all funny. In fact there are no jokes. Weird Sheldon and Amy relationship destroyed the show completely.<br/><br/>I used to be a big fan till third season .Then they introduced AMY character who is not funny. Sheldon became most loved character on TV to most annoying character ever.<br/><br/>Howard character used to be awesome till he got married .Leonard is just there ,he used to humorous in beginning seasons trying to get in love with Penny now his role is just to justify him as a lead role. As characters are settling down , no more fun is coming out.<br/><br/>Raj character and his fake accent is getting weirder .I have seen his interviews he does not sound like that at all. I don't know why they are giving so many scenes to Stuarts character as if they don't have sufficient characters. His tragedy is not funny . I will give it an 8 just because of the good old times but this show is becoming more and more awful. I hoped that after 2 and 1/2 men will end they will focus more on this show, however it is still quite boring. i think is because they let in too many characters. i think that they should have stick with the first ones...Penny, Raj, Howard, Sheldon and Leonard of course. The funny part was about SHeldon and he being an as**Ho*e. Now he is more in the "human" way which i personally don't like at all. AND also they killed Howard's mom!!!??!? What the hell man..she was a great part of the series. ANyway...i really hope they will come back to the original idea, put Penny in front more and also SHeldon. He is the main character and the reason we all are watching the show. CHeers! I should love this show and that's why it's annoying that I can't quite seem to. It looks good, it's funny and the cast all give good performances but much like Chuck Lorre's other big hit Two And A Half Men there is a level of smugness that clouds every episode.<br/><br/>It's a huge hit among teens and you can see why. It's easy viewing, it makes you laugh and there are no real story arcs meaning you can dip in and out whenever. And as E4 in Britain show it on a constant loop then that's probably a bonus. While I admire the show I can't help but feel that the quality of latter episodes shows that this sitcom is straying too far from it's original premise.<br/><br/>Is it the new 'Friends'? For me no. I love this show. I don't know if it is because i am doing my master's too but this show is hilarious. My favorite character is Rajesh Koothrappali ;) I saw some parts on CBS website when i was checking another show and i decided to give it a try. It catches you right away. I still have some problem understanding whole of show because of the terminology and the advanced English but still i enjoy it a lot. My favorite episode is that includes Penny's Halloween party. How Rajesh ended up at the end of the night was my favorite part. I think the success of the show comes from educational background of the actors. I checked their profiles and saw that they all had education from good universities. There is only one guy in the show that i can not laugh at his parts that much. This is Howard Wolowitz character. His character annoys me sometimes but still in the flow of the show, it does not give too much harm to the show.<br/><br/>I love these guys and the show and i think it should last very very long. Where did sitcom TV go wrong? Friends and Seinfeld known as iconic sitcoms and the success has caused a plethora of sitcoms to hit the scenes with most either being cancelled or gaining a massive following because it's simply easy to watch.<br/><br/>Big Bang theory falls into the category of lacking any substantial meat to the show and relies on extremely nerdy/scientific sayings or phrases to make the crowd laugh. This is biased because I'm a biology major so their jokes aren't jokes to me so much as just saying scientific things that make no sense. The show remains popular most likely due to the beautiful blonde Kaley Cuoco, but there really is nothing to this show and viewers would be more wise to watch a show like modern family. The Big Bang Theory does offer a show that you can just turn on and not really have to watch while you do other things but that's about all it is good for. This really is amazing. Random pop culture references are SO HILARIOUS AND GEEKY!!! Let's add a laugh track to make sure the audience feels the same way. (Mind you, I don't mind laugh tracks for good shows e.g. Fawlty Towers. But when you add it to bad jokes, it makes you feel like crying instead of laughing.) <br/><br/>Random science is SO NERDY!!! HAHAHAHAHAAHA! (Yet these genius NERDS don't how to change the password of the WiFi network despite the fact that the router is in their apartment) <br/><br/>But we have to have a character to ground these NERDS and be RELATABLE. That character is none other than Penny, played by Kaley Cuoco. Her acting talent (and totally not her implanted boulders on her chest) cause guys to drool over her and keep watching this roller-coaster of a show. What a great, funny character! (Really though, having her fill this role is a genius idea) <br/><br/>This is the FUNNIEST SHOW EVER! Those nerds never stop making me laugh! My God, Penny is so sex...I mean sensible. Brilliant!<br/><br/>If you enjoy triple hits of sarcasm and constant scoffing, look no further! Frasier meets Friends, only so much better than that! The fact that they put Jim Parsons from Garden State and Johnny Galecki from Roseanne is reason enough to watch it. It's definitely needed as most of "entertainment" today is severely tasteless. The only thing I hope for is that they nix the canned laughter for the second season. It is extremely obtrusive and unnecessary as the humor will find it's way to the right person without persuasion.<br/><br/>Buy it. Watch it.<br/><br/>You won't be disappointed. While the pilot didn't hook me, and the geekishness of our heroes is sometimes annoying, the chemistry between the characters and the tight scripting has made this a must-see for me. For those who think Penny (Kaley Cuoco) is dumb, consider the fact that the big plot element here is the cultural gap. Sheldon, Leonard, and their friends are incredibly smart and highly educated, but when it comes to things outside of their limited frame of interest, they're all as dumb as rocks. Penny, while not a theoretical physicist, is sharp as a tack when it comes to what she's familiar with. The intersection of their cultures is where the real comedy comes in.<br/><br/>That, and Sheldon's obsessive-compulsive spasms...<br/><br/>This is a great sitcom, and worth your time to get hooked on. Enjoy! Oh, BTW, I classify as a computer geek, I'm a science fiction and comics fan, and could, I suppose, be classified as some sort of nerd. But honestly, we're not all as bad as these guys... I'm sorry, but there is nothing redeeming about this show. It just proves the average American TV viewer has no taste. For cheap laughs, Big Bang Theory uses as its premise the stereotype of Silicon Valley computer techies. According to the show, they love computers, quirky science projects, online adventure games, i.e. of the Dungeons and Dragons variety, and action/adventure movies. They have no sense of fashion, constantly use nerdy vocabulary, have the social skills equivalent to your average cactus plant, and seem, most of the time, in another hyper-reality. And, oh yes, the most important ingredient: despite their supposed hyper-intelligence they have no idea how to approach the opposite sex, unless it's amidst a virtual medieval adventure in which they are playing either a knight or a wizard. Saying hello to a next-door neighbor of the female variety becomes a herculean task, apparently much more difficult than solving algorithmic problems relating to rocket science.<br/><br/>Of course, as is typical with Hollywood, all the 20-something characters are played by 30-something actors. The most obnoxious of which is the character Leonard Hofstadter. He speaks with a monotone that would give the Robot from "Lost in Space" a run for his money. Often he seems to wake up saying "Danger Danger". I half-expect him to add the words "Will Robinson". It was marginally amusing the first time, but later it just got old. Also, he consciously tries to infuse every sentence with multiple-syllable words as if he wants to push everyone around him out the door. Including the viewer! (I will say the actor Johnny Galecki does do a fine given that he has to play his character with ultimate nerdiness.)<br/><br/>And of course his merry band of fellow geeks are little better. They are constantly consumed with silly geeky projects that wouldn't impress a 2nd grade teacher. They gather around whatever new and enticing new enterprise in true Romper Room style. And they can't understand why other people aren't absolutely fascinated by whatever it is. The message is clear: they can create great science experiments but can't navigate the opposite sex.<br/><br/>The issue I have with this show is that none of the "geek" characters exhibit anything beyond a laundry list of "geek" stereotypes. They behave as you would expect them. Their jaws drop when they see a beautiful woman but cannot do anything about it except stutter. They become wide-eyed when they hear of some new technological breakthrough, and of course are very self-absorbed with the world wide web. Or when they get upset, they embark on a speech reminiscent of the Gettysbury Address. They are 100% geeks, no additives, no preservatives. And yet, even among the geekiest people you might meet in some high-tech university, none are ever this bad.<br/><br/>I don't have a problem with a show centering around nerdy computer geeks. But the "geeks" need to be something more than just every conceivable stereotype imaginable. There's something seriously missing in this show. If the characters are really just caricatures of someone's stereotype of American techs, the show will be limited and there will be almost nowhere for the stories to go once all the "funny" stereotypes have been exploited and exhausted. Sure, it probably makes for some easy writing at the beginning, but how many times can the characters be spineless around the opposite sex before it gets repetitive? This is really a half-baked show that probably won't live passed a 3rd season and may not survive its second. Of course, I guess there's still enough nerdy stereotypes for more material that has yet to be explored. But at some point, these flat characters are going to run out of geek fuel. Geek culture is limited, but real people are not. I guess what it boils down to is that the geek characters have brains but no heart. And that is why this show is mediocre at best and offensive at worst. Its characters need a little more humanity. Great show. It is very clever, lighthearted and original.<br/><br/>And it is wonderful to have a show out there that actually focuses on the intellectual side of humour, using creative writing and a highly witty dialogue.<br/><br/>I have been watching this series since the very first season, and it has not disappoint thus far. Especially since I am a daughter of a mathematical genius/nuclear engineer and you have no idea how CLOSE Sheldon's quirks are to those of my father. It makes me understand/appreciate the series so much more - and my dad himself overall really connects with the show, and loves it greatly.<br/><br/>Extremely recommended. Especially if you appreciate intelligence. Definitely a show that needs to be kept around for a nice while! It is ridiculously funny! It's bad. Really bad. Nothing in it is remotely funny, and I've watched six episodes. After watching four dismal episodes of The Big Bang Theory, I decided to watch both seasons of the hilarious "IT Crowd" again just to remind myself that nerds can be and are funny. Then after a few days I decided to give the show a chance again and watched the next two episodes, and then I had to quit, it's just way too painful.<br/><br/>I know this is a terribly written review but I wrote it fast because after watching TBBT I was just so angry this even passes for comedy. Bring back "the IT Crowd"... I'm pretty sure the creators of TBBT were fans of the IT Crowd and attempted to make their own version. This show is just watching a dumb show about smart people, the jokes are recurring and very unoriginal going on the fact all of the main characters serve the same archetype of the "nerd character" Throw in a few nerdy references and you get those really dumb bitches on facebook who get the simple joke wrapped up in big words post to face book "Hurrrrrr i get dis joke it so funny i such a nerd giv like pls" It's amazing how a show like this is still striving when much better shows get canned, Look at arrested development for example, Great show, great writing very funny and it got cancelled off of fox then a year later this cancerous show is produced. Coincidence? I think not. Shows like this are slowly killing TV and making it harder for shows that have actual and clever scripts to survive. Making shows like this, shows that are so Goddamned stupid and watered down are only dumbing down the target audience. Plus on top of all of this it is 2014 why the hell does the main character need a catchphrase, this isn't the 90s. Oh wait he needs a catchphrase so the imbecilic audience knows when to laugh, Since a laugh track is used every 3 sentences they get desensitized to it. Please do the world a favor and commit seppuku if you ever purchased any merchandise from this television series. And do the world another favor and boycott the show, don't give yourself TV cancer. Since the end of Friends, I've been longing for a good sitcom from the States. That's not to say we've had nothing funny in the UK, but I do enjoy American comedies. My Name Is Earl had me laughing for five minutes... How I Met Your Mum felt average (even with Alyson Hannigan) and Four Kings didn't seem to last long at all.<br/><br/>But Big Bang Theory has had me in stitches on countless occasions. The humour is fantastic, and the characters are well thought out and just the right mix of geekiness and hilarity. Throw in a gorgeous girl in the form of Kaley Cuoco, action figures and a time machine and well you've got a winner. Seriously, I think this show is gonna mark this generation, this is gonna be a show, to remember just like Seinfield and FRIENDS! The Big Bang Theory is the best sitcom, that we've seen in a lot of year! I wish I could rate this more than 10! because that is what the show deserves! BRAVO to Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady for this amazing show! and also to the cast.. wow! amazing! :) This show brings funny to a whole new level! I also think the show deserves a lot more of publicity! because it's just plain awesome! I think CBS should take note of this! :D My favorite character has to be Sheldon! Oh my God! Jim Parsons it's such an amazing actor, and actually makes me believe there is a genius physicist called Sheldon out there! :D what else can I say.. I just love this show! This show is extremely original and represents the "nerd" culture quite well. It reminds me of me and my friends hanging out. I am also very critical of TV shows. I actually included this show in my top 5. They are: Lost, House, Seinfeld, Curb Your Enthusiasm, and recently, The Big Bang Theory. And when was the last time something good came out on CBS? <br/><br/>The main pro to this show is just that---it is original and creative. It represents something that has only been touched on slightly or represented in movies thus far, how society views the nerd. However, it tends to be pretty accurate. I especially love the episode that starts with them playing a game of Jenga... the others come in and ask what is going on and they promptly respond that the internet is down. The jokes are great with good timing, you instantly like the characters, and so far there is actually a pretty interesting plot to a show that, like Seinfeld, is essentially about nothing---which I think are always the best type of shows. I mean, look at House, has anything really happened? Yet it's one of my favorite shows! (The only exception to this rule, for me at least, is the show Friends... I thought it was absolutely atrocious). I recommend watching at least one episode, that's all it took for me to be completely hooked! <br/><br/>There are two cons to this show. The first one I noticed is that it can be slightly cheesy sometimes-although I think it was meant to be that way. The laugh track is very bothersome as well. I think laugh tracks are unnecessary and it ruins some of the jokes, you honestly have to tune them out. Would give it a 10/10 if it did not contain a laugh track. This show is smart, funny and most of all intelligent (without being intellectual or highbrow). Like the show that precedes it, HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER, it reflects the type of friendships and bonding that happens only when one is in their twenties, before kids and PTA's and politics and family. So much television is centered on the adolescent market, seeing young adults on these shows is as refreshing and they are hysterically funny. I truly hope that neither of these shows are hurt by the writers strike. Just watching them takes this middle aged man back to a different time in one life. And it is nice to see that things are pretty much the same for young people as they were thirty years ago. CBS PLEASE LET IT LIVE!!! I hadn't laughed like that with a sitcom since friends ended.. I love it!.. it's like watching my friends 10 times more nerds than they already are.. well.. me included... I loved when Leonard came out of his room armed with a light-saber! that was great! and the discussion with superman.. that was impossible to rescue Louis without cutting her in tree pieces.. God.. that idea never crossed my mind.. and it makes sense!!!<br/><br/>Sure somethings are exaggerated, but that's the idea of comedy right? funny common and real things exaggerated.<br/><br/>I'm not really a TV fan... but I think I'll be waiting every week to see this one... hope it last..<br/><br/>Realmente Excelente.. la recomiendo... :) I am not much of a TV series watcher these days. Very few of them capture my attention. I used to enjoy such shows as "Northern Exposure" and "Taxi" because they were well-written and had very interesting characters and story lines.<br/><br/>"The Big Bang Theory" is like that. Very interesting, unique characters and story lines, often, but not always, involving a scientific theme. I am a scientist, and maybe that is partly why I appreciate the humor so much.<br/><br/>The 4 guys are super-intelligent scientists but, predictably not very socially adept. One of the guys, Sheldon, is the super-smartest of the group, with an IQ of 187, and also the most socially-challenged.<br/><br/>The 4 geeks are balanced by pretty Penny who lives in the apartment across the hall. She is a completely normal, pretty young lady working as a waitress.<br/><br/>For me the star of the show, the character that makes everything go, is Jim Parsons as Sheldon Cooper. His mannerisms and comic timing are just perfect. And coincidentally, Parsons grew up around where I live, is the same age as my oldest son, and graduated from nearby Klein Oak High School.<br/><br/>Johnny Galecki is funny and good as Leonard Hofstadter, Sheldon's roommate. Kaley Cuoco is good as Penny. The other two geeks are Simon Helberg as Howard Wolowitz and Kunal Nayyar as Rajnesh Koothrappali.<br/><br/>A very entertaining TV series, I try to watch it every Monday evening. My thanks to my good friend Larry for calling this show to my attention.<br/><br/>May 2019 update: The series wrapped up last night with the final episode, with Sheldon and Amy winning the Nobel Prize, Penny is pregnant, and the apartment building elevator is now repaired. This was a special 12-season run, the regular actors won the acting lottery, they all went from relative obscurity to multi millionaires set for life. All thanks to us, the viewers. I admit I watched less regularly the last 3 or 4 seasons, the episodes became less interesting and entertaining, but the wrap up was first-rate. It was time to quit. The Big Bang Theory revolves around a group of friends, who are all intellectuals in their own right, and the awkward and humorous manner in which they deal with work, romance, friendship and everything in between. <br/><br/>I just don't get it. <br/><br/>People rave about this show. "Sheldon Cooper", or at least the actor, is comparable to Leonard Dicaprio, the way that people go on about him. I do not understand why. The humour on this show is on the level of a Disney Channel show. Right next to Suite Life on Deck and just above Dog With A Blog. Stuff that won't even make you blow air out of your nose. The characters are inconsistent and often annoying. The single character of colour throughout the entire series is an exaggerated and frankly offensive idiot. <br/><br/>Not worth the hype at all. Wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy. This TV show is so funny! Sometimes I don't even understand what they are saying. Jim Parsons is... God, he is the perfect Sheldon! He acts phenomenal here, no one can replace him and his role. I didn't like the TV show at the start... until one day i was passing channels, and i stopped there to see the show, and I fell in love with it! Then, i looked forward for all the seasons on internet, and i couldn't believe, i almost watched the whole 2 seasons at one day! The script is so clever, and I can't help it, I am in love with Sheldon.... he is like the most heartless and selfish person but he is so hilarious, and you can't forget, that this is only a TV show... but who knows... maybe out there is a Sheldon cooper :). I am also in love with Woloowitz... Damn, he is such an asshole but so cute too! :D This is actually, the only TV show I've fully seen... all the chapters and seasons.. It was like an obsession. I highly recommend this. 10/10 Of course! When i heard of it i thought it just won't work. but this is brilliant!<br/><br/>I can't stop laughing, and the characters are just great. I hope this show will have many seasons because i just can't stop watching! u just cant hate it!<br/><br/>i'm not really smart but i understand all their talking and that funny like hell, all my friends agree with me, one of the best shows around! 12 episodes and keep going on! every new episode just keep getting funnier!<br/><br/>CBS please keep this on air!we want it!<br/><br/>I really recommend this show for every one and one of you... When i first saw this advertised i wasn't convinced it would be the show for me. How wrong i was. The basic plot is based around four geeks with no clue about women and a gorgeous women who's just moved to the area. An unlikely friendship materializes and they end up forming a group that get up to everyday things with hilarious consequences. The writing is excellent and the acting is better. Each character is extremely funny in their own way. I would recommend this show to everyone, anyone with an ounce of a sense of humour will find this funny and enjoyable. Well lets face it, the fact that the very sexy Kaley Cuoco stars in it also helps. The laugh track, and the fact that it's so overused, should be enough to make you turn away from this horrendous TV show. But if your ears can handle such brutality, your'e in for something much worse.<br/><br/>Every show has the same form to it, it consists of dull and stupid setups for some punchlines that should not be considered funny on any level, every episode I watched was this formula looping over and over and usually with no REAL dialog between, and therefore the infamous laugh track keeps getting played way too much. <br/><br/>The main character, Sheldon, is just awful in every way and makes you wonder how anyone could tolerate having such a person in their'e life. Even if he's supposed to be this way for humors sake, like other shows have done, and often with much success, this character is simply the worst.<br/><br/>These two examples are just the tip of the iceberg. Almost everything else is also a total failure in this show. The popularity of shows like Big Bang Theory and Two and a Half Man makes me wonder what has become too humanity and humor altogether. i wasn't going to watch this at 1st, mainly because i was annoyed at having kaley cuoco joining the last season of "charmed" (as a long-time fan of that show, i didn't feel it needed a new character at that time). however, it was placed in between 2 of my Monday night staples, so i allowed the tivo to record. i must say i was quite and pleasantly surprised. i actually laugh more at this show now than i do at "two and a half men". (sorry writers, but you seem to be slipping a bit w/your 1st work--still hilarious, though!) the character of sheldon, as annoying as he can be, has got to be the funniest. he's so literal and blunt with his comments, that it just cracks me up every time. and he's not even trying to be funny--he's always serious and means what he says! if anyone needs a good laugh, check out "the big bang theory" every Monday night on cbs! :0) I swallowed 9th season in a few days and, although quality is decreasing since first few seasons, this is still the very best sitcom I have ever seen. I rarely watch more than one episode of any show at the time, maybe two in a row in rare occasions, but when I start this show I simply can not stop until season is over, sometimes even two seasons at once.<br/><br/>10/10 For about half a season this show was really funny but their refusal to expand on the concept quickly led to the same rehashed jokes in every episode.How many times can the elevator being broken be funny?About four in my opinion.Sheldon having his "spot" was funny about three times.But they trudged on for years with no new ideas, somehow gaining popularity the entire time.The first real change they made was having two hot girls pretend that they are interested in these very boring guys.They rode that idea until it died, about three seasons too late.Then by season eight they were so desperate for ideas that they had Penny cut her hair.Pretending that anyone could be attracted to the new manly Penny is a mind blowing idea.They also started to make all the stories about their parents dying or getting divorced.A sad attempt at continuing a show that should have ended five seasons ago.It's really no surprise that this show keeps getting worse, very few shows continue to be good after the third season.Watching the first season wouldn't be a total waste of time but I wouldn't suggest going any farther than that. The first 3-4 seasons are easily the highlight of the series (especially the episode where they went camping at the desert in order to observe the celestial activity).<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the creators weren't able to continue to produce at the same level and pace for the rest of the series. The jokes aren't funny anymore, due to the fact that they are not connected to the situation (always a bad thing for a sitcom show) or, just because they are objectively uninspired/bad/grim. Most of the recently added female characters had a weak script/role to work with or/and aren't remarkable comedians in general. Worst of all, I don't feel invested in the main characters of the show anymore, since they feel just as fake and stereotypical as any character in a mediocre TV Show.<br/><br/>I become more and more bitter and apathetic about The Big Bang Theory :( I watched the early episodes and enjoyed them immensely. But they relied on the nerdiness and awkwardness of the guys around girls. This is the essence of the characters. After a little time Leonard became an absolute STUD.For a few weeks, indeed, every new female character in the series is 'pulled' by Leonard. This has proved its undoing for me. There is not enough tension or believable character building. There are still nice little comedy moments, but the overall annoyance of Penny choosing Leonard with his little hands constantly clasped, and if they split, Leonard rampaging through the hot babe population is too much. I find more effortless and consistent character based comedy in a regular diner scene in Rules of Engagement.And at least the couples were in the same LEAGUE. The only 1 star goes to Sheldon Cooper, who holds the show with his remarkable act. Else, its the WORST show I have yet seen. How can Lennard call himself a friend of Cooper, when he himself, along with 2 other idiots, ditch him per episode. The over-acting of Penny, Raj devastating the tradition of India along with his sis; contribute to this review. I only watch just to enjoy Cooper's comedy. But that doesn't means that one can ditch his excellence. If you cannot control his intelligence, you shouldn't have shown him SO intelligent at first place.<br/><br/>AND MY GOODNESS FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE, CAN ANYONE IN THIS WHOLE WORLD TELL PENNY TO STOP OVERACTING. SHE'S ALREADY WORSE, HOW MUCH WORSE SHE'LL GO!!<br/><br/>Director, producer and writer, a humble request. Distribute credit to EACH and every character EQUALLY. LEARN SOMETHING FROM "FRIENDS".<br/><br/>Damn it! <br/><br/>Anyways, don't have lesser star than 1.<br/><br/>:-} In a world of unintelligent TV broadcasts and shows with lax morals, Big Bang Theory stands above the rest. The humor is derived from more than the traditional sexual innuendos and slapstick so prevalent elsewhere. It is evident that a high amount of research goes into the comedic dialog and the frequent "nerd lingo." Casting was done brilliantly for all parts. The introductory theme song is catchy without being annoying and sets the upbeat tone for the show to follow.<br/><br/>That being said, there is still room for growth. Sheldon's character, as portrayed by Jim Parsons, carries the series. This isn't a problem until his already eccentric mannerisms are exaggerated to the extreme. For example, when he makes echo-location noises in a theater to find the acoustically optimal seat, or constantly ties small infractions to "the downfall of civilized society" the character's believability is broken and the audience's intelligence is slightly insulted. It doesn't happen often, but when Sheldon or any of the 4 guys break character, you are reminded that this is just a TV show and the spell is broken.<br/><br/>My second and only other complaint is the laugh track. Never before have I heard one so relentless and intrusive. This too insults viewer intelligence. The show has enough original and enjoyable content for the audience to decide on their own what is funny and what isn't.<br/><br/>I have been living with the nerdiest of the nerds for years now at college. I can absolutely match people I know to the characters and mannerisms on the show, which makes it fun to watch in groups. For those that think these characters are completely fabricated, guess again! (You just don't see them that much because they rarely venture outside.) Overall I would have to rate this my favorite currently running show. Hopefully they are able to keep it intelligent and fresh without having to resort to unbelievable extremes. I'm really enjoying this series so far.<br/><br/>I'm currently studying for my Physics degree and some of the conversations the characters have on topics within physics obviously relate to my humour.<br/><br/>It seems to me that the writers have tried to include some (or equal amounts) of non-physics related jokes to keep the programme light enough for all viewers... unfortunately, I think this is where the programme struggles, as some of the jokes are less than funny.<br/><br/>However, taken as a whole this series has had me laughing out loud many times. Im thoroughly enjoying it. At last! A show that really understands geeks! If the TV networks had to depend on me, they'd be as broke as General Motors and Chrysler! So when I do watch a show (other than PBS or the History Channel) it's gotta be good! I was nerd when nerd wasn't cool, working in the computer biz for, well, a few years. I really can identify with the characters in the show and I love the interaction with the gorgeous Penny, who deep down inside has a heart of gold and watches out for her four unique friends.<br/><br/>Here's a question. I haven't seen Stephanie Barnett in a few episodes. Are she and Leonard still an item? <br/><br/>After a hard day slaving over a hot computer, I really need some laughs, and they keep coming on this show. How does Sheldon manage to say all those preposterous statements with a straight face? Leonard, Sheldon, Raj, Howard -- and Penny -- all have their own little quirks, and that's the glue that keeps this show together. The banter keeps you in stitches.<br/><br/>I sure hope it comes back next season!!! I'm glad to read in other reviews that I'm not the only one who can't stand this show.<br/><br/>Friend of mine was talking about it few years ago. I tried watching it back then and didn't liked it. I see it running on local cable channels all the time, I didn't even knew it lasted 12 years. So every time I find it while browsing the channels I try to like it. I've tried really hard. Few times.<br/><br/>Guess what - it never gets to impress me. Watching these nerds doing nerd stuff all day long is just boring.<br/><br/>That main character Sheldon is f**king annoying. I guess that's the type of a person of which they say "when you see it, you want to punch it in the face". The only one that not annoys me was the guy with the glasses.<br/><br/>That laughing-track puts the cherry on top. They laugh even on things that aren't funny. Wait..... there is actually nothing funny in this show.<br/><br/>I still can't figure out why my friend likes it so much, to a point to buy a t-shirt with "BAZINGA!" on it.<br/><br/>I won't watch any more of this show even if you pay me to.<br/><br/>My rating: 1/10 I thoroughly enjoyed the show till the 5th season after that it lost its charm. I mean now the season is not even hilarious, if you remove the back laughing track you wouldn't even know that in which part you have to laugh. I just gave it 5 stars because its 1st five seasons are hilarious and can be rated 9 but since then it's just crashing down with every new episode.
Earlier when Raj was unable to speak to the girls without the drinks, it added a funny factor to its character but later i don't know why they should him Gay and then they showed him as well as the comic store guy as the most pathetic single. The character development of this series is not good. In the 1st 5 seasons every one was funny and Sheldon was like icing on the cake but then after season 5 to 7 only sheldon and Howard was funny and then after season 7, even sheldon is not funny anymore. I loved the first few seasons of The Big Bang Theory. The trope of the nerdy scientist who can't handle everyday life without outside assistance is silly, but then it is a comedy show. All the geekyness was very well presented, always mixed with a clever piece of science or some fun about technology. Leonard chasing after Penny was part of the deal, and it was fun while it was original.<br/><br/>However, over time all the boys got girlfriends, even wifes, and now kids. The geeks and scientists were sent to the background. Things like shoes, make-up, family drama, and talking about "feelings" took over the stage. All the nerds became responsible adults and talk about careers to get their kids through college instead of all-nighting the newest MMORPG.<br/><br/>By the 11th season TBBT has turned into a run-of-the-mill sitcom and almost a chick show. Episodes with intelligent science jokes have become the exception. Almost every episode is about how the cast is feeling towards another, how their relationships evolve or who will get pregnant next.<br/><br/>In theory there is nothing wrong with this, but TBBT used to be a show for geeks and nerds. There are hundreds of patchwork family-style sitcoms out there, so I'm very disappointed that The Big Bang Theory joined the bandwagon.<br/><br/>There is nothing special about this show anymore, and that's a damn shame. Its closer to Gilmore Girls now than the nerds of old. I didn't like the show for the first few episodes when it first started. BUT it grew on me and after awhile it was hilarious. It really was.<br/><br/>The character development of these four guys was GREAT in the first 5 seasons. 
Leonard and Penny going back and forth was funny and sometimes sad but even then it was well written and they eventually seemed to click.
Not anymore. Penny just puts him down all the time. They seem to no longer be in TV Love. Its time to get a divorce. IT really is. There is no chemistry there and never really was. She should go for a few more auditions, ace one and become her real dream of a movie star. BUT TV kills dreams. I've noticed in TV NO ONE is allowed to become successful. Since the early days it has always been the same. <br/><br/>I don't understand why not. SO what if she became a hugely successful movie star and she and Leonard go their separate ways but do stay friends. He should be with someone like the comic book girl or the secretary Sheldon had a for a while. THEY would have worked better He is too insecure and annoyingly so. <br/><br/>Howard and Bernie...uh not so much. They have never really clicked. Why the writers and show runners thought they would is a question I cannot figure out the answer to. And her voice? Oh lord she is annoying and mean. AND it is her meanness that makes her more and more unwatchable. She is mean to Howard and his friends. AND she puts down what he loves constantly. Where she lost me was (Spoilers) when she LIED to get rid of his prized Phone Booth from Dr. WHO. IT took up NO room in the garage but she was determined to destroy something he liked and she LIED to get rid of it. The way she is written would be the sort of thing that would destroy a marriage. They have written her to be unlikable and mean. WHY?<br/><br/>Sheldon and Amy seemed like it would just be a possibly one season thing. BUT they don't work. And never have. Her character development is so stunted as to be unbelievable. She has been around those two others yet still dresses like an old maid. Her character has NOT developed one bit especially for someone who has gone from no friends to an entire new life and exposure to the real world.<br/><br/>Raj? When are they going to get rid of him. His character is the worst. At first it was funny about his drinking to talk to women but then he became an Ahole the way he did talk.And his constantly ratting them out is no longer funny. It was at first but now...his character should have been ostracized after getting a good beatdown for ALWAYS ratting everyone out. That bit was old when FEZ did in That 70's Show where he always ratted everyone out. He was always going OOPS. And it got old fast. They would not have let him hang around anymore because of it. Raj is the same but worse.<br/><br/>PLUS his character could not be anymore gay if he tried. The best thing would be to have him go back to India during the seasonal show break and come back married to a MAN at the start of the LAST season. He needs to come out of the closet.<br/><br/>AND when did they go from never getting dates to suddenly nothing but beautiful women? Is this in the new contracts over the years? I hope Beth Behr is getting well paid to do this with Raj. There is NOTHING there at all. <br/><br/>As a four some single guys they were pretty funny and entertaining. But when they started marrying them off or hooking them up, the humor went away and it became the same old tired sitcom bit of the men are socially stupid and the women are always right.<br/><br/>THEN the worst part of the writing. The women met these four "nerds" and, hard to believe, fell in love with them and then immediately started putting down everything the guys loved. Making fun of them and treating them like 12 year olds. THEN why did the marry them? THEY knew what they were. Amy and Bernie constantly putting down science fiction is just plain mean. THIS is what the guys all like and it was what made them funny and endearing.<br/><br/>OH this this UNIFORMS thing...since when did writers and producers decide they had to wear the same clothes ALL THE TIME. Doesn't Leonard EVER take that damned jacket off? He works in it, comes home and never takes it off, goes ot and never takes it off. It must stink pretty bad.. <br/><br/>AND does anyone really believe in this day and age NONE OF THEM knew anything about Star Wars, Star Trek and Indiana Jones or FIREFLY? REALLY?<br/><br/>The ratings are starting to slide and they are losing their key demographic. My niece in college when she went starting in the 5 season uear said they actually would have watching parties and the reruns were hugely popular. In her last year she said it was no more. The show lost them.<br/><br/>The writers and show runner are absolutely TERRIFIED to think out of the sitcom box and that is why it is staring to slide. I think people watch it now NOT to get great laughs but out of habit. This show tonight didn't have a single laugh in it. Sheldon bullying his way in just was the worst part. He has gone from being funny in a mentally ill way to just being a total AHOLE.<br/><br/>IT has just become awful. I have watched exactly TWO episodes this season and after tonight I doubt I'll ever watch it again. IT just isn't funny and any and all so called laughs are telegraphed 9 lines in advance. EVERYONE with the show thinks going out of the box will destroy it or they just have not got a clue as to how to make it funny again. Beth and Walter you must have really needed the money.<br/><br/>I might see what happens towards the end of the season but geez stop making Sheldon a bully, the girls mean to their men and bring Raj out of the closet. I can't even believe this show is still on, they are litterally milking the cow dry. Just please stop. It was an amazing show for the first like 8 seasons, now it just ran dry. please stop. What can I say? I just love everything about this show. The combination of comics, LA, science, nerds and Love (I probably missed a few things) mixed in one show - just brilliant! Normally I'd go for, drama, horror, adventure or thriller, to be honest I don't like comedy. I find it meaningless. But after watching this show, I've come to explore parts of me/ muscles I didn't know exist. I'v excepted not everything must have a meaning, and that you can just take some time off and enjoy a huge lot of laughter. <br/><br/>I don't know how to review the story other than it's constantly developing and shifting which I love. I love the characters and their stories and qualities. The cast itself is just perfect, and I can only imagine how much fun they must have on set! <br/><br/>There is a reason why this show is one of the biggest at the moment, the writers, cast and crew really knows what they're doing. Just watch it! The original idea was excellent, with quirky characters who were very funny as smart but socially awkward nerds, along with their hot neighbor. However, after just two seasons it lost its freshness, unfunny girlfriends were added and it became a relationship comedy, Friends style, but with the dumb laugh track as the only laughter.<br/><br/>It gave us the exceptional character of Sheldon Cooper, so kudos for that. If you enjoy constant laugh tracks to things that are about as funny as watching your cat getting hit by a car, this is your show. I feel bad for those who enjoy this depressing show as all of the jokes fall flatter than how my mothers heart flat lined. In conclusion this show has given me some sort of STI. How you may ask, I have no idea. This was the best series ever for me! Then suddenly the cast started to develop into completely different characters from who they were in the first 5 or so seasons..<br/><br/>Penny is suddenly smart and bitchy, so is Amy, Raj is always whining and in the current season Sheldon is drinking alcohol almost every episode. And on top of that it's all about relationships now. It's like Friends, but with smart people.. Where is this all coming from??<br/><br/>Chuck Lorre did the same thing with Mike & Molly, where Molly developed into some kind of Tiran-meets Charlie Chaplin. The series was cancelled and rightly so! Is he actually killing off this show too?? As said: such a shame... The show is full of witty humour and is unbelievably good. They managed to keep the quality through all 6th seasons. The actors' acting is brilliant, the plot if wonderful, and I can say this show is immortal.<br/><br/>But the last episodes, starting with the episode 19 (6th season) are not funny anymore, even boring, the humour became flat. I had to literally force myself to watch them. Have they changed the writers or what? Rajesh's met a girl, and after this the quality of the script has decreased. The motto, "Ever geek will get a chick" is not working here, i'd say. The actors are trying their best, though.<br/><br/>I hope in the next, 7th season things will get better. well few months ago i was not a big fan of TV series because i found them too long or boring or missing the punches that we want to see. but after watching few episodes of big bang theory i was completely hooked to it.the series made is more than a genius piece of art.the characters are really awesome and perform there part really well and Sheldon is really the winner and others also are.so in short "a series full of laugh full of humor and full on entertainment thats all.well i hope the last season will be full of surprises and twist.congratulation to Sheldon for winning Emmy award .well thats all the big bang theory deserve a lot of success.. A TV series which has dominated the ratings over the past few years and has seemingly overtaken Two and Half Men as Chuck Lorre's "best work" with only 5 seasons of viewing and many more to possibly come.<br/><br/>A show of the lowest common denominator. It relies on the masses who religiously watched Friends as the crux of the fanbase and has abused the culture trend of being a "geek" or a "nerd" to act as a crutch for the so-called "humour" in the show.<br/><br/>Wildly overrated as the laugh track is obnoxious, it is a show that relies on repeating slogans into ad nauseam and running jokes which are more cringing than entertaining. A subpar script only saved by a laugh track which dictates the viewer when and when not to laugh and feel emotion. <br/><br/>A show that panders to the lowest common denominator and is evidence that through hysteria and mass social engineering that any one dimensional product/franchise/event can be successful if there are people who like to have choices for themselves made for them by someone else.<br/><br/>A shame that this era of television will be seen as the inception of this show and all the unnecessary praise to go with it. This show deserves more than the 1/10 I gave it, but there are a few MAJOR issues I have with this show. First, its a very clever show that has tapped into a segment of society that is not given much air time on prime time television....nerds. Also, for the most part I think they have respected Christianity better than most new shows do and I appreciate that. What does bother me is the dedication in corrupting the brilliant minds that are the main characters of the show. Once again, sex is the only thing that seems to matter to most of the characters and the only one that doesn't care for sex is the "outcast". What really disturbs me is the use of "blackout sex" as something comical. Anyone who has experienced this or knows someone who has knows that is a very big problem. Anyone who does blackout while drinking is most likely a severe alcoholic, weather they believe it or not. It bothers me how Chuck Lorre uses this plot device to excuse "sleeping around" with his characters in most of his shows. This show is targeted towards young people like myself and with all the dangers of sex now-a-day, the most irresponsible thing that can be done is to promote very dangerous behavior as "normal". My niece likes to watch the show but I did make a point to fill her in on this subject. I suggest those who know others that watch this show to do the same. Everybody I know and their brother (or sister) loves The Big Bang Theory and thinks it's comedy gold. Personally, it just shows how far network television situation comedies have fallen.<br/><br/>TBBT features unrealistic stereotypes of nerds, geeks and Bill Gates- types that scream 1985 spouting mostly unfunny lines while an intrusive laugh track (the worst one I've ever heard) virtually dominates the show. TBBT relies on a mix of raunch and pseudo-intellectualism to generate its "laughs". Oh, and they throw in a blond for good measure.<br/><br/>I just don't see the appeal of this show. It's trappings make it more than a nuisance than a pleasure yet many people tolerate it for some reason. The characters have zero charisma and are one-dimensional. They rely on the same running jokes every episode, such as the stair climbing in the ancient building they live in. And of course, the loud, intrusive, annoying and ridiculous laugh track just kill any desire to watch it.<br/><br/>I'm sorry, but this show is not very good but we live in a society that embraces mediocrity so I'm not going to change anybody who thinks this show is sheer genius. You will either love or hate The Big Bang Theory. I know where I stand... In a sea of crap that fills the airwaves I was surprised at how many people on this site that actually seem to hate this show. I agree that this is not the best show ever but it is far from the worst. The characters are very funny the writing which may not always be the best seems to be well crafted to the actors/characters. Throughout the seasons each of these people has grown on me and with the introduction of the new females actors the show has gotten even funnier. I like both Bernadette Rostenkowski, Amy Farrah Fowler. <br/><br/>I also enjoyed the almost Rosanne reunion between Leonard (Johnny Galecki) and Leslie Winkle (Sara Gilbert). I think the show still has lots of promise with very enjoyable characters. I will continue to watch. I was a little late in hopping aboard the "Big Bang Theory" bandwagon, missing the first 10 or so episodes of the first season in 2007 before realizing what millions by then already knew: This is one of the funniest shows in years; certainly the most intelligent comedy since "Frasier," and filled with more laffs per episode than any sitcom since "Seinfeld" and "Raymond" called it quits. What has most surprised me, now that I have rented out that entire first season on DVD to play catch-up, is how fully formed the show was, right from the pilot, with all five main characters fully actualized, and the program functioning as a superefficient laugh machine right out of the gate. In that pilot, we meet, for the first time, two young physicists, Sheldon and Leonard; the not-so-dumb blonde hottie, Penny, who moves into their apartment building; and their fellow geek/scientist friends, Howard and Raj. Addicted to video games, comic books, all manner of sci-fi and exotic takeout food, the guys also happen to be complete social misfits and pretty hopeless around the opposite sex. Indeed, Jewish Howard, although a self-styled smoothy, only manages to repel with his obnoxious pickup lines, and Raj cannot even speak to a woman unless he's hopelessly smashed on alcohol. Leonard is the comparatively normal guy in the group, and Sheldon...well, he must be seen to be believed; a completely humorless, Mr. Spock-like misanthrope who just happens to be absolutely hilarious.<br/><br/>Highlights of the season 1 DVD set, incorporating 17 episodes, include the boys attending a dance class; Sheldon's Doppler effect costume at Penny's Halloween party; a drunken Sheldon performing "L'Chaim" on piano at The Cheesecake Factory; the very first "Knock, knock, Penny" appearance; Sheldon's attempts to explode others' minds "Scanners" style; and Sheldon's attempts to master Mandarin Chinese. And if there seems to be a disproportionate amount of Sheldon references here, it is no accident. Though the other four performers in the show--Johnny Galecki, Kaley Cuoco, Simon Helberg and Kunal Nayyar--are all marvelous, it is Jim Parsons as Sheldon Cooper who truly makes "The Big Bang Theory" something very special. The way in which he throws out dialogue is just amazing, and his character, after just three seasons, must automatically be placed in the TV pantheon of all-time-great comedic misfits that includes such classics as Maynard G. Krebs, Eddie Haskell, Frank Burns, Louie de Palma, Latka Gravas, Jim Ignatowski (is it obvious that I still deem "Taxi" the funniest show ever?) and Steven Urkel. The Emmy nomination for his work in season 2 was well deserved, and his failure to win a miscarriage of justice that will hopefully be rectified later this year. Anyone not already acquainted with this marvelous show would certainly be pleasurably impressed by it; or, as Sheldon himself might put it, "Any humanoid who has not shared a time/space vector with the audiovisual emanations of this telecast may find his or her serotonin and dopamine levels radically enhanced after being subjected to them." Bazinga! The show not about science but about two geeks who live across the corridor from a beautiful girl and who couldn't be more well....different.<br/><br/>This show proves there are still funny comedies out there that not only have great jokes but also fantastic characters.<br/><br/>And there are no better characters than the guys on Big Bang Theory. From the women shy Raj to the sleazy weirdo Howard Wolowitz, from the cool blonde Penny to the downright lovable Geek Leonard and last but definitely not least the obsessive and down-right unexplainable person that is Sheldon Cooper (who has to be one of the best sitcom characters around) The show works because of the chemistry between the cast with all the actors showing great comedic skills. The geekiness is superb and great to see these type of characters instead of your normal, stupidly beautiful, bimbos and perfect lives. These people are losers in love, misguided, clueless about social issues but endearing. The film/TV/sci-fi/comic references are fun to spot and every episode provides many laughs.<br/><br/>The Big Bang Theory doesn't get enough credit, its not shown enough on UK TV and is in a bad time slot which is a shame because it is up there with the brilliant Frasier, 3rd Rock from the Sun and Two and a half men.<br/><br/>Geek power! Cute, nerdy, full of stereotypes but funny enough for everyone *in the geek department, I admit* to spot quite a few points of resemblance with actual persons you know of, including yourself. I just hope they will soon break the "input-snappy retort" pattern the dialog tends to institutionalize but let this series grow and I'm quite sure that it will evolve from the too obvious path of "beauty meets geek, beauty falls in love with geek" etc. We should point out as well a very "Russell Peter" style of humour, gently brushing everybody against the grain. If you're allergic to that kind of humour, tough. You'd better be watching something else. This was a brilliant comedy from season 1 to 3. Then, I noticed a decline from season 4. From season 5 onwards, it became , stereotypical, condescending. Stopped watching.
You start wondering why the characters even like or tolerate each other. They're simply banking on the work they have done in the first 3 seasons. I absolutely love this show! I don't get why people hate it so much. If you hate it, you don't have to watch it! This has been my favourite show for years! I never choose to watch this show but since my old roommate always watched it I gave it a chance. I'm not a nerd so maybe I don't get it but how freakin selfish does sheldon have to be?! He does a few - well I wouldn't call them all grand- okay gestures to keep his friends who obviously only hang out because of circumstance. There's no empathy and it makes people with mental disorders all look like a-holes. I couldn't find one whole episode I liked in the first 3 seasons but there were a couple good enough jokes. So was it a need to appeal to more females? Bad writing and a lack of ideas? Whatever it was it has ruined the show. <br/><br/>4 nerdy awkward scientists, 3 of them girl crazy, one of them the "straight man". Hot blonde moves in across the hall of 2 them. Hilarity ensues. Lots of nerdy talk, lots of humour. <br/><br/>So what goes wrong? Coupling up. Howard gets married and how has two kids. His wife is blonde but certainly not hot and is a Shrew if ever there was one. <br/><br/>Sheldon, the super practical awkward super nerd couples up with the rather boring and it must be said ugly Amy. He is never the same again. <br/><br/>Leonard gets with the blonde chick. <br/><br/>And Raj? Well he goes onto date one white woman after the other, failing each time. Actually the red head he dated was funny and I would have loved it if she had of stayed instead of Amy. And why is it every woman he dates white? Perhaps by now he might want to try an Indian woman and see if his luck improves? Seems more of the PC agenda pushing we see so much of now days.<br/><br/>Once a great show. After catching the odd episode of the show on E4 and knowing how popular and well liked The Big Bang is, when was added to UK Netflix, I decided to commit and watch it from the beginning. <br/><br/>I'm currently 3/4 of the way through season 1 and I can no longer bear to watch. The humour is completely forced and a complete miss (although I'm assuming it's more funny to scientists that understand the science-related jokes), relying on overused cliches and stereotypes. According to this show, all scientists are nerds that cannot function around women or indeed in the wider world, that spend all of their spare time playing video games and reading comic books, whilst all beautiful women are airy-fairy idiots whose favourite pastime is seducing and sleeping with me and are only valued for their sexual attractiveness. <br/><br/>The main cast are unbearably unlikeable. Sheldon with his annoying voice, constant melo-drama, incessant pessimism, criticisms and inability to do or say anything without over-complicating it with unnecessary science means it's impossible to understand how he's managed to make any friends. Howard who is a big man child that still lives under his mother's thumb and spends the rest of his time sliming his way into women's pants through any means necessary. Raj, who is apparently so 'damaged' that he can't even speak to women - what the hell is that all about? Penny who is completely devoid of any emotion or personality and is characterised soley by her prettiness and Leonard's obsessive crush on her. Leonard is somewhat more bearable, but still completely devoid of any personality. The big question I have is why are any of these characters even friends? I can't see any reason any of them would be friends except the fact that they live in close proximity. None of them like Sheldon, they barely tolerate him and constantly avoid him. Penny barely understands a word that comes out of their mouths and cannot relate to them on any level (not to mention the fact that Raj has had only one conversation with her so far). The men do have more of a connection in that they're all scientists and males, which is more than what Penny has in common with them. <br/><br/>Although sit-coms characteristically lack in the presence of any real plot or story, there is usually SOMETHING going on, but 'The Big Bang' doesn't even have that. All you have is essentially another version of 'How I Met Your Mother' with a lot more science but an equal amount of emotionally stunted men and nonsensical humour. I love this show from the beginning,but somethings need to be done for my beloved show We need to get more scenes in cal tech with beloved characters like Kripky ms Davis others,I miss those old days of Lesly winkle Barry with Sheldon, the show got closed in the last 2 to 3 seasons a lot of characters gone without any explanation, voids needs to be filled and fixed in the context, the gang needs to hangout more not separately, we need more of Sheldon's mother and Hofstader father what happened there? Please bring the old geeky fun,and for the love of God find someone for Raj he is miserable ! Lorre please fix it make it fun again The Reason I'm writing this review is because I've seen a lot of people who have wrote recent reviews hating on it bad. I don't get it, I've loved this show seen it began and that hasn't changed! I find the humour on a regular basis hilarious! Yes there are episodes that aren't so funny but in my opinion not many. The thing is though that's like any TV show you will rarely find a sitcom or any show for that matter where you will enjoy every episode. All we can hope for is a well written show we overall thoroughly enjoy.<br/><br/>The Big Bang Theory in my eyes is that show. It's funny, intelligent and relatable to many. I personally find the characters to feel like real people that end up in very funny but real situations. Sheldon is awesome but beyond annoying and the situations they all have with him are so freakin hilarious! What makes the Big Bang Theory a show I will love for the rest of my life is the feeling that this could be any nerd eating there dinner at the coffee table with a bunch of lovely lady's all unique in there own way. That's why I love it and that's why I love Friends so much, the very real aspect the show brang, just like the Big Bang Theory...<br/><br/>Overall I love this show as much as I did when it began and those who hate it honestly don't know good TV when they see it! I have watched this show many times in syndication. I believe one of the show's enduring qualities is that four awkward geeky nerd guys like Dr Sheldon Cooper (played brilliantly by Emmy and Golden Globe winner Jim Parsons).; Dr Leonard Hofstadter (played beautifully by Roseanne's Johnny Galecki); Howard Walowitz MS (played by Simon Helberg); and Dr Rajesh Kooperthali. They live in Pasadena, California where the California Institute of Technology is also set. Things change when a blonde female neighbor Penny (played by Kaley Cuoco). Penny excites awkward Leonard where as his roommate Sheldon is repulsed by human relations. Guest appearances by Christine Baranski who plays Leonard's mother, Beverly, and Laurie Metcalf who played Mary Cooper are always worth watching and I wish they show up more! The addition of Mayim Bialik and Melissa Rauch was wisely done. I wished Kevin Sussman would have stayed regular. This is on Chuck Lorre's shows and much better done than "Two and a half men," or "Mike or Molly." The Big Bang Theory is a terrific series,its insanely funny,the main reasons being how nerdy the characters are.Like everyone else,my favourite is without a doubt Sheldon Cooper (played by Jim Parsons),Sheldon is such a jerk and cant help but correct people and that what makes him so funny,another favourite of mine would be Raj,he is hilarious mainly because of him not able to make any effort to talk to women unless he has alcohol in him.<br/><br/>Four nerds,trying to handle there job as doctors while handling the women in there lives,are also still able to keep up with there comic books as there weekly store.Leonard lives with Sheldon,who he finds very hard to live with while dating his neighbor across the way,Penny.Seldon is also dating a girl called Amy who is very like him.Howard,still lives with his mother and is engaged to a girl called Bernadette,and Raj,lives in an apartment on his own because he is unable to talk to women. First few seasons it was hillarius, then later it was a bit less funny , but the ending of this show makes up for everything, just magical.... Soooo Exhilarating...must watch... Ending made me cry... This show is really worth watching and the best one yet. After reading a lot of the reviews and noticing a lot of 1 star ratings based of the fact that the characters were either "annoying" or "repulsive" I felt I could provide some rational input.<br/><br/>The show does have it's highlights especially from seasons 1 to 3 which will always remain its strongest seasons. I grew up with this show on the tele and decided to watch the whole series beginning to end. I will admit I did take a large gap before completing the 12th series. However, the repetitive jokes and humour are not lacking in quality to that of any other sitcom I've watched, ie. Seinfeld, How I met your Mother, Friends or Two and a Half Men. It's a sitcom do not mistake that with Breaking Bad or Chernobyl, because I promise you; you will be disappointed.<br/><br/>The characters are well developed and brought to life by the actors and actresses who play them. The comedy and later direction of the show may have displaced viewers opinions for example the growth of cast and emphasis on relationships in the later episodes, but the humour is still there and may grow tiresom for some viewers but might create a relationship built on expectation for others. This show wouldn't have made any sense if the characters did not progress and I've seen shows beat a dead horse far worse than Big Bang Theory does.<br/><br/>This show does appeal to people who enjoy pop culture and although somewhat repetitive, it is unique and fun. Although disguised as nerdy and scientific this does not mean it will appeal to every physics major who has graduated. Just because some of the jokes might not be funny to them, for the rest of us we can still participate in a laugh (even if it doesn't make sense, that's why we laugh). At the end of the day this is a sitcom with characters who have flaws that most of us wouldn't tolerate in real life, which in my opinion has lead to a lot of unreasonable 1 star ratings. Who would tolarate any characters from a sitcom in real life let's be honest. This "flawed character" is the very same element that made Seinfeld so successful.<br/><br/>I personally enjoyed the series. I wouldn't have waited week after week for 20 minutes of content but being able to watch episodes back to back definitely helped shape a more tolerant opinion. If you enjoy sitcoms about friends, relationships and at the end of a hard day of work you just want to relax and enjoy a glass of wine, some food and a good laugh I highly recommend this show. The greatest part about a sitcom is you can stop watching when ever you get sick of it, and when you miss it you can switch it back on again and continue your binge. Give it a shot! A prime example of a series being dragged along for far too long and being stripped of its identity bit by bit. The first few seasons (until season three, maybe four) used to be pretty consistent, fun enough considering the heavy use of asocial stereotypes. Sure it wasn't the most gracious depiction of the smart character type but it didn't overstate situations and made the atypical, strange, unusual world of the nerdy protagonists seem interesting and exciting. Jokes and situations had some weight and elaborate setups helped in delivering an enjoyable result.
Everything spiraled down after the inevitable tonal shift toward romanticism and relationships. As our protagonists one by one found a female partner, jokes began to become stale, always centered around such relationships. The show turned generic, shallow and even more stereotypical. There are still some watchable episodes but overall it doesn't work as well. The atmosphere is not the same, demeaning jokes are predominant, some characters turn annoying most of the time and punch-line deliveries become omnipresent. It's almost a different show that gets worse and worse with each passing season and, thus, I don't recommend watching past a certain point because it's not rewarding and quite honestly a waste of time. Thank you for what an amazing 12 years, changing what people see about nerds and geeks outside there This review is split into two parts, this first part is for seasons 1-8<br/><br/>seasons 1-8 are great nerdy comedy, with heartwarming moments, i love all the guest stars, the star wars/trek stuff thay often do. and all that good fun stuff,<br/><br/>but for seasons 8 and up- i feel like the show has changed very much, its focused more on relationships and science stuff, and very very little on nerdy stuff, i cant even remember the last episode where they dress up in costumes, such as when they were stranded in Desert in Star Trek costumes !! haha...<br/><br/>but for the past few seasons, we didnt see much if any of that... the final season was very disappointing multiple times.. such as when Avengers Endgame came out.. i feel like the earlier seasons of The Big Bang theory (if endgame had came out then) they easily one of had an entire episode focusing around the movie- such as when they saw Indiana Jones, and didn't get in !!<br/><br/>so for seasons 1-8 id give it a 10/10
but as for 8 and up, it only gets a 5/10
.. im giving it a 6 just to even things out. This show is hilarious and has a great cast of characters. It has grown so much over the years and I have loved every minute. The guest appearances have also been awesome. What began as an unwatchable, annoying excuse for a comedy, cliche upon cliche, descended into further depths of numbing mediocrity. Was painful to watch just one episode and have been forced to watch snippets of other episodes. Unbelievably excremental. I don't like it because it's funny. I like it because of the characters. I can identify with several of the characters and can really identify with Sheldon. The people who complain about that the others are mean to Sheldon when he has some sort of mental issues is stupid. I would be happy to have friends like this.
Stop complaining and enjoy the show instead or don't watch it if you don't like it. Loved this show for the first seasons. The last several seasons have been really sad! You know longer care about any of the characters, except possibly Raj. Everyone else has become pretty unlikeable, and you really don't care what happens to them. Please let it end! The first few seasons were funny and smart. It has gone downhill. What bugs me the most: it is absolutely unrealistic that the working parents of two small children have the time and opportunity to have meals at their childless friends anytime they want, go on outings (paintball, again?) without planning weeks in advance, and generally live as if their kids do not exist. We never see or hear the babies. We only see a baby monitor on the kitchen table. Do they have an invisible nanny? Aren't the kids sick sometimes and would require the presence of a parent? I'm not even sure there are car seats in their car.
I don't enjoy the show anymore. Fortunately, the Young Sheldon spinoff is quite funny! One of The funniest shows from season 1 to season 7 after that it turns unfunny and boring unfortunately. When I started watching this series I really enjoyed it up until season 8 it went downhill from there and didn't feel like the normal big bang theory I started to watch but it's still good just doesn't feel the same. They also waste characters, they add them and either hardly show them till later on then they leave the show or add good characters keep them for a while and then they leave like Emily one of Raj's best girlfriends and she then left the show and I felt like it could have gone somewhere with her.
I'm still enjoying the show but not as good. What has this show become? The introduction of the main women(apart from Penny of course) did not go well and began the deterioration of this once great show. I understand that they were running out of angles for 4 nerds and Penny but the new women completely changed the landscape of the show and snuffed much of the comedy that kept the show afloat. The first 1-4 or 5 seasons were an 8/10 for me, after the show continues to deteriorate into the current season which I would say is a solid 3/10. Whether the show is kept alive a while longer or killed soon we have already seen the best this show will ever give and luckily it's all back to back in the first few seasons Funny moments interspersed with significant cliched moments. I would give it a go but if you're a Seinfeld or Friends fan, you may be disappointed I'm very disappointed. the newest season is being set up to end poorly. i'm so disappointed to see how this show has gone. i'm debating not watching it anymore. When TBBT first debuted, it had tremendous promise. 
The dynamics between the cast was electrifying, and hilarity constantly ensued. 
Simon Helberg as 'Wolowitz' was such a pure joy to watch! So much attention seems to be drawn to Jim Parsons 'Sheldon Cooper', and while he is talented, I think Simon Helberg is the TRUE star of this show! 
The guy is just fantastic! He is hilarious, and incredibly talented in music and slapstick. 
I think he is the TRUE star of the show. 
But when they introduced the character of 'Bernadette', for me, everything went downhill. 
Why, oh WHY is Bernadette such a nasty and vicious little monster?!
I don't know if it's written this way because the writers think it's funny, but I only see 'Berny' as a contemptible, conniving and snippy little bully!
Every chance she gets, she is belittling Howard, turning him into a poor henpecked sap. 
I'm sure Melissa Rauch is a lovely lady, but this character of Bernadette has really ruined TBBT for me. 
In fact, I don't even bother to watch anymore.
 The thought of Penny marrying Leonard was such a dumb idea as well. They have absolutely NOTHING in common. 
It was much funnier when Leonard was chasing Penny. 
My final thought is that when Bernadette was introduced, that was this shows "jumping the shark" moment. 
Please put TBBT to a quick and merciful end before it turns into a parody of itself! Love the show since the moment I started watching the first episode. Never thought that it would that fun to watch when i started it but just after 2 episodes i was hooked. Really the comedy and the dialogues are amazing. I wonder where they came up with this stuff?
Sheldon is the best character in the series and really praise to Leonard's character for how he kept up with him for all these years. Raj is kind of getting boring along the years but with Howard there to keep him company he is still able to bring out some laughter. A bit bad that Raj is the only one in the group with no girl, but it can be understandable based on the behavior of his character. 
I really love the show even though in the last 2 seasons it been a bit lacking as compared to when it started running but still it never gets that boring, that you would want to stop watching it. I hope they add some more interesting elements into the play so to keep the show alive otherwise it might really get to the point where it will not be that fun anymore. This is my favourite TV series ever,especially Sheldon is the best character in a sitcom TV Series.U should definitely watch,don't miss this! Absolutely awesome TV Show . I Watched the 1st episode and had been an addict since then. The Plot is quite simple but the essence of this show dwells in its characters which are by far the funniest i ve ever seen. 1st TV show about geeks and nerds. I rate it A+ without doubt. Sheldon is just perfect and the other guys of the crew are just crazy. The gorgeous Penny is also here to remind us how out of the world the geek group is. Hilarious !! PS did anyone know they made a X rated parody of that show ? http://www.anallica.com/video/61487/Big-Bang-Theory---An-XXX-Parody Once again a must seen TV show. You can't pass through that ! First of all, ignore those 1-star reviews. I believe they tried to watch it in this pandemic time and failed to grab it. If you are not into sarcasm, then you better ignore it. This whole show is all about friendship and sarcasm.<br/><br/>I watched these 12 seasons twice so far. And every time I watched it, I laughed. Even I know what is going on and what will come after it.<br/><br/>Thanks to the cast and crew for this fantastic show. All I want to say, Bazinga the best series ever. I cannot sum up how much I hate this show so all I will say is that in my opinion this is the worst comedy ever created. In my entire viewing of this I laughed once and it wasn't even at a joke, it was how incompetent and devoid of intellect this show is. It drained my soul just to listen to the "Haha funny" jokes that this show has such as "Sheldon sits in chair" and 'Bazinga' Any comedy show that needs an annoying laugh track to make people laugh is not fun. I do like the show, however it lasted longer than it should. This show is just horrible. Jim is awful. Just awful. The only thing worse than him is Blossom trying to regain some sort of fame but she's a horrible person in real life. She's a female version of Mike Pence. I hear nothing but bad things about Cuoco who I find unfunny and unattractive. This show is a dud for the most part. Ill give it one extra star because Leonard is somewhat likeable. This show is easily the second worst sit on on tv behind "how I met your mother". Let's be honest. <br/><br/>After 50 episodes the show was done. Yet we sit here nearly a decade later watching the same linear characters play out each week. <br/><br/>This show hasn't been relevant since 2008. You have to watch an entire episode to hardly smile at one or two decent jokes. Jokes are not at all intellectual or clever, and barely makes you smile, let alone laugh aloud. Laugh tracks makes it even worse, and are inserted where there isn't even a joke. Characters have not matured one bit, last time I saw season 7/8, and the story is just being dragged to come to the most obvious happy endings of sitcoms. Better to watch stand-up comedies than this drivel. The show is getting a little boring. Sheldon is one of a kind but this can't keep someone interested for more and more seasons. Yes it still might make me laugh but not as much as it used to. I don't know if they've run out of ideas or the actors are bored. Maybe both. It is an OK show that needs to come to an end in my opinion. I have been watching this show since 2008 I really liked this show but somehow the quality of the show is degrading its not because any of the actors are not doing any well, the quality of the actors is good but according to me the story-line of the whole has degraded since they have started the "Season 9", the main problem with this show now is that the story does not make me and my fellows laughs anymore. The starting of the Season 9 was pretty dull, bu they improved after 2 shows and gave a laugh to all of us, but after the Christmas Holidays it seems like they are just dragging the show towards the end of the season. <br/><br/>Please don't ruin this show anymore,many people love this show, we have already lost two great shows in the last 2 years, i.e., "How I Met Your Mother" and "Two and a Half Men". I know the show will continue on to the next Season 10 but just for the sake of the fans please make it more interesting, I know the motto of this Season 9 is "the engagement of Amy and Sheldon" but in doing so they are ruining the quality of the show. People in India also love this show, please don't hamper the publicity of the audience. I also know they don't give a Crap to the Audience of India, but in America many of the Indians love to watch this show. <br/><br/>Earlier this shows used to make us laugh and made us to forget all the stress of the day but now i isn't getting Interesting, more like Dull, as i saw the episode 14th of the Season 9. We love this show at our house. Granted, we are NOT a Nielsen family. We have multiple college degrees, teenagers in honors courses, and a rocket scientist in residence. In short, we get the science jokes! It's refreshing to see something that does not DUMB DOWN the dialog or content to the average 3rd grader's comprehension, and that's one of the main reasons we are hooked! The main characters have a nerdy charm that's appealing. They use more sophisticated language than your average sitcom but then turn it just right so that they aren't taking themselves too seriously unless that is the comedic intent. The cheesecake factory waitress is adorable and adds an element of common sense the geniuses find curious or miss entirely.<br/><br/>Leonard is the most normal of the bunch and is a perfect compliment to the Obsessive Compulsive Sheldon. Their other two equally but differently nerdy friends round out the group nicely. Though it pulls you out of the story, it's still fun to see former "Roseanne" cast members crops up in feature roles, particularly Sara Gilbert as Leonard's work associate. <br/><br/>Some of my favorite moments ***SPOILERS*** Selling the Sword of Azeroth on ebay, Leslie (aka Sara Gilbert) heating up her cup o'noodles with a laser, questioning whether or not Sheldon is a robot (invoking Asimov's laws of robotics) while playing Jenga, using luminous goldfish for a night light, Leslie (again) referring to that big piece of wood between Leonard's legs (the cello!), .<br/><br/>Favorite lines ***SPOILERS*** "Who hasn't seen that computation on any men's room wall at MIT right above 'here I sit broken hearted?'" "I am the Sword Master!" "How many Superman movies are there?" "You're kidding, right?" "Yes, I play cello. My parent thought that naming me Leonard and signing me up for advanced classes didn't get me beaten up enough." <br/><br/>*LMAO* I just love this show. This show is absolute garbage. It's not clever, it's not funny, it's not interesting, and the characters are so generic. <br/><br/>The laugh track drives me insane. Go ahead, watch it with the sound turned off, you can see "blah blah blah" *pause* "blah blah" *pause* "blah" *pause*. It really angered me that they played two lame episodes in my last flight. It made me so mad, I came here to post a review of how awful the show is.<br/><br/>Ugh, now I have to write 10 full lines about how bad this show is? OK, the girl has this "cute" laugh in between each lame laugh that takes place in the episode, even during a serious conversation. It's so off putting.<br/><br/>Please kill me. I want to stop thinking about it. I'm done writing this review about this dumb show. This is my favorite show, ever.<br/><br/>I love that it's not about a fat American husband with a super hot wife. <br/><br/>It sets itself apart and I laugh out loud, really hard, almost every episode. It gets to the point where I'm crying.<br/><br/>Great cast. I'm glad that Raj's character is fun again. For a while I really disliked him but now I'm really enjoying his lines in the new season.<br/><br/>Very smart, excellent cast, BRILLIANT show. Thank you Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady!<br/><br/>By the way, I am proud to wear my Sheldon BAZINGA shirt :) So it ain't the greatest American show ever, but it damn close to what reflects society today. OK, this may contain potential spoilers for those who haven't watched the show at all.<br/><br/>I originally started TBBT right after it's pilot and fell in love with it. I love the inventive interplhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0898266/usercomments-enteray between Leonard and Sheldon, Leonard and Penny, Penny and Sheldon and from there the play between every other cast member. Johnathan Galecki and Jim Parsons are great as the nerds, John as the one that is smart but socially awkward (which is almost thrown away in the 3rd season) and Jim as the focused Sheldon who will stop at nothing as the Einstein-like Sheldon. Their counterplay alone is amazing and hilarious. <br/><br/>Galecki is great as the nerd who pines for the beautiful blonde. Parsons is equally entertaining as the scientist that will stop at nothing for the Nobel Prize. Helberg and Nayyar are not only great as the sidekicks but are amazing as their own personalities. They have some great scenes together, like when they find the "Next Top Model House" at the end of one of season 2's episodes. <br/><br/>I am hoping for great interplay between all the character for at least the next couple of seasons. This is one show that I can't wait for the next episode to see where things go. No matter where it starts, usually the ending is a hilarious, yet fitting conclusion. <br/><br/>All the power to the Big Bang Theory and here is to many more great seasons.<br/><br/>Damien Jaymz out! Speaking as someone who watches a lot of TV, I have to say that very few sitcoms (even the ones that I like) really make me laugh out loud even once per episode. The Big Bang Theory is quite good at bringing the funny! Tonight I lost count tonight at how many times I laughed out loud. The actors are awesome, and the writers are brilliant! I really hope that the powers that be in the Network get wind of things said here. And, I hope that when the next impending strike rolls around, none of the people associated with this show are axed. I also hope that TBBT has a very long run, and may they all go on to make other series, which are just as good! Since, for some reason this website makes us put ten whole lines of text in these posts, I am just filling in with words - words which may or may not have anything to do with the point that I wanted to make, so you may choose to stop reading now, and I wouldn't be offended. this show is a must watch for all.... it is unbelievably smart and witty and the comedy keeps you laughing throughout... it is simply a laugh riot unlike all those stupid brainless protagonists used in other comedy shows, the creators have come with the novel idea of using two scientists as the protagonists... and it makes wonders... probably the best comedy series that i have seen since " friends"... sheldon and leonard will take you into a new arena of comedy that you may never have seen before... and believe me it will make you yearn for more... it is a pity that the first season was stopped to just 17 episodes but the 1st episode of season 2 lives up to the expectations i had from this comedy masterpiece from chuck laurie kudos to big bang theory and may this show go on for 10 more seasons From the title of this show I expected something wholly different. However, this is one of the best comedy TV shows that has come out in a long time. Good sitcoms seem to be a dying breed in favor of cheap to make reality TV, which to me is uber boring. I can go outside and see enough of that from my neighbors or better/worse yet I could watch the news. I am glad to finally see another fun sitcom come on TV. This show may be a bit silly with it's ditsy blonde and nerdy characters, but that just adds to it's hilarity. It has been so long since I have actually laughed out loud while watching a television show. It was very refreshing. I hope to see a lot more of this show. The popularity of this show is modern mystery, though I suppose that just because E4 shows the entire series from beginning to end 5 times daily it doesn't exactly mean that anyone is actually watching it. The Big Bang Theory is so gratingly dated, using styles and techniques that went out of fashion in the early 90s and a character dynamic that didn't work with Joey but somehow is resuscitated by the agonizingly overenthusiastic laughing sheep in the audience. They try to cover it up with an overabundance of pop culture references but I'm not falling for it.<br/><br/>None of the characters are all that likable. Sheldon is an annoying pedant with almost no redeeming features. Howard cannot get through half a sentence (usually some lame sexual innuendo) without boring me to tears. Raj is never really given anything to do. Leonard fails as the 'straight man' to their weird antics, and his on/off/on/off/on/off/on/off/on/off relationship with Penny is more irritating than Ross Geller's 'we were on a break' schtick from Friends. None of these characters properly develop and the live-audience nature of the show gives every single line of dialogue an overly rehearsed feel turning many scenes in each episode into an unbearable ordeal.<br/><br/>The Big Bang Theory is so phoney and false it's like acid in my face. Live-audience sitcoms are out of style. Laugh tracks in general are out of style. If it were not created by Chuck Lorre this aggravating crap would never have made it to the air.<br/><br/>The 4/10 rating is merely for Kaley Cuoco's occasional pointy nipples. I can literally watch an episode of this show and NEVER laugh, smile, chuckle. The show was created by the same guy who made "Two and a Half Men" (need I say more?) and probably written by the same folks. They have little knowledge of science and basically wrap up the same lame one-liners in pseudo-scientific jargon that has little to do with the humor. For the most part, the characters are totally unbelievable. I don't think there are any scientist in the world that are as smart as they are supposed to be who act so oblivious to how the world works. Sheldon needs to be in mental counseling as depicted. He is VERY annoying and you wonder why the other roommates don't shove him to the curb. There is also no way in hell the girl next door would have anything to do with them. This show is just more of the same from CBS, the number one network of retirement centers everywhere. Honestly this is one of the most irritating television shows I have ever seen. It is obviously written to a particular target audience that has zero understanding of the majority of the satirical content. The laugh track is unbearable. The acting is absolutely terrible. The content is focused on making jokes about things which most of the target audience has little to no understanding of. This show makes me feel like network television is not something I am ever interested in watching, which is sad because there are a number of well written network programs that are being overwhelmed in the ratings by this absolutely horrific piece of garbage. 'The Big Bang Theory' - the American sitcom created by Chuck Lorre is an excellent show and perhaps the very best of comedies currently on television. The writing or plot is impressive and certainly shows that science is fun even for the one's who do not get it. The show presents a stark comparison of the lives of a geek and a normal person. Also, I love the vanity cards of Chuck Lorre at the end of the show. They are simply awesome, intelligent and smart. The guy is humorous, of-course, visiting his site made it clear why Sheldon is so superb at what he is, only Chuck with his detailed insight and clever mindset could have pulled it off.<br/><br/>The show deals with the daily activities of the four friends and their neighbor Penny, a waitress aspiring to be an actress. It is a total package of wit, humor, romance, stupidity, understanding and friendship (3 strikes huh!).<br/><br/>You cannot miss it for all you get.<br/><br/>The genius of Sheldon who is a total package of knowledge but no wisdom, far far away from the social incumbency. It is quite hilarious when he tries to understand and get sarcasm, and the practical pranks he plays, and you are gonna love the occasional faces, and who could forget the room agreement.<br/><br/>The understanding and innocence of Leonard. The guy does well to put up with a room mate who is undoubtedly the biggest freak show. He is essentially the glue that binds them all together.<br/><br/>The subtle remarks of Howard. The one I like most is in reference to Penny - See a penny, pick her up and all the day you will have good luck. Great bond with mother he got there, although mother never been seen.<br/><br/>The common sense of Penny and definitely the only sex appeal factor in the series. The only cherry to the otherwise not so delicious pastry. She indeed presses on the so obvious that show might circumvent around geeks but itself is understandable and fun.<br/><br/>And of course Rajesh. What can I say, I adore him, not just because he brings a lot of Indian spice to table but also because of the precious words that fade away in presence of a gal.<br/><br/>The series would go on and so it must. Great television series, definitely the best of its kind. It does not fail to surprise me and the thrills of the characters pack enough in their arsenal to roast my head off. A must see! I changed my review. At first I gave this show a 10 , but this was based on the first 3 seasons. Then gradually this became a bad version of "Friends", which in itself was not as deserving of accolades; Though the jokes were funnier , but the acting was bad. I digress.
Leonard should never have ended up with Penny. Despite the fact they dated in real life is not comparable; because well that is real life, 2 wealthy actors. Part of the charm of Leonard and Penny was the non-attainable bimbo. Both of these characters looked unnatural with each other and it is understandable. No chemistry whatsoever. Leonard was annoying and they made Penny smarter than she should have been for that type of character. In what world does a guy like Leonard hook up with a woman like Penny. None that I am aware. Also, Howard was awesome as the horny guy making awkward passes all the time. Adding a love interest and eventual wife was the death of a great character. Simply put this show sold out. Sheldon remained the one constant but even his character was neutered by a love interest and one, you guessed it, he eventually married. Raj is Raj, never a compelling character. They took an awesome, creative concept and made it ordinary, even though they put square blocks into round holes to do that. Very sad and the best thing I can compare it, is liking a unique rock band and then the band changes their music to ordinary to garner more support. I felt like this show was a well kept secret and then when the secret was out so to speak, the show just lost all its character, charm, originality and soul. I have watched about 10 episodes of this show and i just love it. I think a science background of the person watching the show does matter for this kind of a show if u want to GET all the jokes on offer. I myself am from an engineering background and i have seen a lot of nerds in my time (no one matches up to sheldon though!!) and i can see matching traits here. if anyone was to just tell me the concept of the show as "4 nerdy guys and beautiful girl next door and different types of nerdy jokes", i would never have imagined how funny it can get. I am Indian and we get this on Zee cafe here. But it stays on only if the American channel hangs on to it... So here is hoping for many more seasons of this great show!!! Answer - Big Bang Theory. This is such a smart and innovative show that grows and changes and surprises, and this probably explains why a comedy based on the lives of four young scientists who work at Cal Tech in Pasadena for minor duckets when they could earn big money in industry is going to last at least ten seasons rather than the outside three seasons it would have lasted if it had remained static.<br/><br/>The center of activity is Sheldon's and Leonard's shared apartment in which the elevator has never worked. Why it doesn't work is explained in one of the episodes. Their friends and colleagues are Howard, who dresses like it is the 1970's, has very bad pick-up lines, and is henpecked by his never seen mother, (That is the fun of it - what DOES she look like?), and Raj, an astrophysicist who is so shy with women that he cannot speak to one unless he is intoxicated.<br/><br/>The central thread running throughout the series is Leonard -who in appearance is 5/10- and his quest to win Penny - in appearance a 10/10. Leonard is a brilliant but kind guy, the heart and conscience of the entire show IMHO, but he probably has very limited dating experience when the show starts, and he is infatuated at first sight with the girl across the hall who is only a high school graduate, seems to pick her boyfriends based purely on looks, and is an aspiring actress making ends barely meet as a waitress in the Cheesecake Factory. Thus she is not only not going to "see" Leonard, if she did see him she is not going to "get" him. Well, that's how things start out anyways.<br/><br/>Countering Leonard, who has the soul of an artist, is his roommate Sheldon Cooper. Never in the annals of television has there been a character like this. A brilliant physicist who was a Ph.D. as a teenager, he runs his life like the well oiled machine that he seems to be, is a creature of habit to the point of having OCD, and just does not understand when people don't appreciate his input when it isn't wanted or his lack of it when it is. He is a human Spock in many ways, yet there is a closeted kindness in him that slips out from time to time that makes me like him. His anecdotes about growing up in rural Texas in a deeply religious household are priceless. Sometimes the apple does fall far from the tree.<br/><br/>Now this whole premise could have died out in a few seasons if the show and its characters did not change and grow, but they did. The show also added two additional female members to the cast. First there was Amy Farrah Fowler, added as a girl friend (note I did not say girlfriend) for Sheldon. She is Sheldon's counterpart in almost every way except that she is a sexual being, and she also seems to have a thing for Penny in word if not deed. Next added was the mousy-voiced yet feisty Bernadette as a love interest for Howard, initially a blind date during which they had to admit they had nothing in common until they both discovered they had overbearing mothers. The rest is history.<br/><br/>This gave the show great flexibility as all three of the girls in the show become friends, and some scenes revolve around just the girls, some around the couples and their inevitable problems, and some are just the four guys together doing geeky things. My favorite of the geeky scenes is when the guys figure out how to turn the lights on and off in Sheldon's and Leonard's apartment by programming a computer to send a signal through the internet and back to the apartment. Penny is puzzled. Why don't they just reach over and turn on the light? <br/><br/>Being an engineer myself, I can relate to all of this except the guys and their obsession with comics and comic book characters. I think the show's writers added this from the beginning just so that non-scientists could relate to some dimension of the characters' activities without having to open up their old college physics books. Plus the guy who runs the local comic book store that the main characters frequent turns out to have a rather big place in some of the plot's turning points.<br/><br/>I don't know how much longer this show can go on - I still enjoy it immensely. However, some of the main characters are entering their mid 40's. Maybe Warner Brothers would have cast younger actors if they had known this would be a decade long run, but I can't imagine anybody but the current cast believably and entertainingly inhabiting their roles.<br/><br/>And no, I'm not going to tell you how Roseanne and Gomer Pyle have something in common with Big Bang Theory. With google and IMDb you should be able to figure it out for yourselves, or else you are probably not going to enjoy this show! i bought the season 4 DVD a month back when i saw the show i was so angry that i was kicking myself thinking why the blue hell i bought this nonsense,vulgar,racist,unfunny most stupid show on earth.<br/><br/>look at the weird plot of this worthless comedy show.4 nerds & one freaky girl create madness to make people laugh.there is really an audience for stuff like this,its sad<br/><br/>i like suspense & action TV series.there are a lot of shows out here like castle,the mentalist & dexter which are superb.but this is a pile of junk i tell you how can someone enjoy this just because it involves jokes & overdoing of stereotyping everyone its funny.is it only dumb people enjoy this no offense but this show is disgusting each character is like a walking crackpot.raj,penny,Sheldon,Lenny & Howard the only guy i liked in the show was Lenny to be honest because he was very balanced.other then that all others are stupid wannabes.just what is wrong with audience these days if this is comedy then i am so sorry its just a great insult to the genre look at British comedy of 90s like Mr bean or take American comedy three stooges.those 3 fools were awesome.<br/><br/>the time & era we live in is just messed up.& when i look at shows like these & see people talk about i loose hope in humanity. the most embarrassing moment comes when Sheldon crosses the line & uses extremely sexual jokes.sure there are few funny moments but the show don't work as it repeats the same thing in every episode being loud & crazy is not creative the characters never gets in control to enhance the story of each episode.<br/><br/>overall don't bother watching this show at all i recommend to stay away from it.the big bang theory is for shameless people only<br/><br/>my rating is 2/10 don't wast your money on buying disc set not worth it This show is breath of fresh air for television in general. Since first aired in 2007, I thought nothing of watching it as I had only seen a few advertisements for it on E4. With '24' just finishing last year and 'Supernatural' finishing until April, I thought I could do with a laugh from something different from 'Friends' so on the advice from a classmate, I sat down to watch the first season of TBBT. Honestly, it is extremely addictive. The fun witty humor oozes from every corner of the sitcom and the timing is perfect. The casting is phenomenal especially with Jim Parsons as the over-confident, speak-your-mind and totally hilarious Dr. Sheldon Cooper. The storyline is fairly basic which adds that touch of realism and the situations they find themselves in are in a word, side-splitting. I highly recommended that people from all aspects of science be it Computer Science to Astro Physics and even people who don't know squat about science watch this show, it will have you hooked and laughing in minutes! This show keeps getting funnier and funnier. <br/><br/>I bought the first season pass on iTunes so I've already been watching episodes over and over and this show is not only funny the first time around but even more hilarious the more times you see it and it doesn't get old. <br/><br/>Everyone I've shown it to loves it from teens to much older. It even made my father (who doesn't laugh at anything) laugh out loud.<br/><br/>The humor is intelligent but not pretentious. There are great physical gags as well.<br/><br/>So watch it, show it to your friends. This show is the hidden jewel of new comedies.<br/><br/>And, please CBS don't cancel it!!!!! So very Painful to watch. Every character is irritating and every episode is the same. We get it your smart ha ha .. ha I did not start viewing this series when it first came on CBS, but recently over the last 3 or 4 years I've became a regular viewer the series has me hooked. You have it all smarts, wit, funny stories and good laughs with the gang a group of smart nerds who live in apartments across from a beauty! Now what more do you want on a series again Chuck Lorre is the master at making people laugh. "The Big Bang Theory" is carried by two smart and near brilliant Caltech research professors who are best buddies even though they disagree a lot. You have it now enter Sheldon(the wonderful Jim Parsons)and Leonard(Johnny Galecki)who become such good friends that they share an apartment together and even though they have academic differences they both share the love for video games, comic books and sci-fi movies especially "Star Wars" and "Batman". The big difference is that Sheldon is a loser when it comes to women and Leonard is a ladies man by having a hot and sexy waitress the colored bra wearing want to be actress Penny(the so hot Kaley Cuoco). As Penny rocked the California teacher boys world all the way from the midwest. Overall wonderful show that's fun with laughs, wit, love and sex appeal provided by Penny it proves it's all right to be a nerd or geek people are different and a mind is a terrible thing to waste. At first the look of this show did not interest me at all. However, after watching an episode I was pleasantly surprised by this show. A lot of reviews say the characters are too clichéd, but that's the point isn't it? It's a bunch of nerds living next to a cute girl, you just have to take a lighthearted approach to this series and overlook its few flaws and enjoy it. The characters are all quite funny, and add there bit to the show. They are growing into today's confident nerds as the series progress, and it's starting to seem very relatable. I am not a nerd myself but there is times I can find myself relating to some of the situations the crew get into. Plot summary doesn't do credit to the sheer brilliance behind this Sitcom. Contrary to what you could believe, you don't need to be a geek/nerd to enjoy this show.<br/><br/>Sure being one gives you the benefit of getting every jokes flying around, yet most of its humour can be enjoyed by anyone due to the incredible talent of both its writers and cast.<br/><br/>I cannot praise writers enough for delivering such interesting characters evolving in a world surrounded by cliché and yet offering a perspective of its own to said cliché. Nothing annoying or seen a thousand times here. And everything served with the magical ingredient of awesome dialogs both witty and unexpected.<br/><br/>As for the cast, everyone works great and all characters click together.<br/><br/>The only big turn off for me is the live recording. I just hate audience laughters. And it's even worse when from time to time production just emphasis some laughter with prerecorded ones. Even with this big disappointment the show doesn't fell short of 10 stars to me.<br/><br/>I Hope it will entertain you as much as it does to me. I am big time fan of comedy series on television and this is by far one of the bests I have ever come across.<br/><br/>The characters are well suited for their parts, the dialogs are funny and witty and the story line is moving. The show revolves around two physics geek who get an unexpected new neighbor - A Hotty named Penny. Severely lacking social skills, they try to hit on Penny. What adds to humor are their two nerds friends.<br/><br/>There is one caveat to this show though, if you are not a science student, then in many cases getting the jokes can be a challenge.<br/><br/>I still vote this is a great show to watch. I absolutely adore "Big Bang!" Two scientists - Leonard (Johnny Galecki) and Sheldon (Jim Parsons) - are roommates who have a new next-door neighbor Penny (Kaley Cuoco), a pretty young blonde who is a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory. For Leonard, it was instant attraction. For Sheldon, it is irritating because she disrupts his ordered lifestyle. Penny enjoys talking with Leonard because he breaks down his "science talk" for her, while Sheldon gets infuriated that she doesn't understand. To cap off everything, Leonard and Sheldon have two other science friends, Wolowitz (Simon Helberg) and Koothrappali (Kunal Nayyar). Wolowitz is your classic Don Juan-a-be while Koothrappali just clams up at the mere sight of Penny, who mistakes his shyness for his excellent listening traits.<br/><br/>Seven episodes in, it's hard to tell whether a romance will blossom, but I've got my fingers crossed!<br/><br/>I really enjoy the classic lines, such as Sheldon telling Leonard "You have as much chance with Penny as the Hubble Telescope has of discovering that at the center of each black hole there is a little man with a flashlight trying to find the circuit breaker!" Then there's Leonard to Penny's ex after he saw them kissing at a Halloween party where Leonard went as Frodo Baggins from Lord of the Rings: "That's right! You saw what you saw! That's how we roll in the Shire!" It probably won't last just because I thought it was funny, but the story of two geeks (Johnny Galecki and Jim Parsons) and their friends and a ditsy blonde (Kaley Cuoco) had some clever moments.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there are only two episodes in the can, so maybe next week will be the last chance to see it.<br/><br/>Like I said, I thought the premise funny, and certainly more interesting that "Chuck." How can you not laugh at friends like Wolowitz (Simon Helberg) and Koothrappali (Kunal Nayyar)? Are there real people with names like that?<br/><br/>Check it out before it's gone. This is a show that has definitely needed to find it's footing. Prior to the strike, there was perhaps 1 1/2 episodes that I found even remotely amusing. But once they came back, the writing seemed to sharpen up, and the show is definitely improved over its early episodes.<br/><br/>I think it will have to improve immensely to get a third season (it's already been renewed for a 2nd), but the potential exists.<br/><br/>Three things need happen to make the show work: 1. Involve Penny (Kaley Cuoco) more into the show, not just as the sometimes annoyed/sometimes amused neighbor. Right now, she only serves as the outside observer to the nerd/geek factory generated with the other 4 characters (Sheldon, Leonard,Wolowitz, and Raj) Perhaps integrate a few "street smart" lessons from her into the lives of the guys. They do that a little now, but they need to do it more.<br/><br/>2. Continue to crack into Sheldon's demeanor so he doesn't come off, as one person put it, like Frank Burns in the lead role. (Remember, the character of Frank Burns became useless once they decided to marry off Hot Lips.) Let some humanity creep in there. Whether he develops it himself or learns the hard way, completely hate-able characters don't work on a sitcom.<br/><br/>3. Decide a pathway for Leonard and Penny and move with it. Right now, it's all a tease, and not a very good one. This is not to say pull a Dave/Maddie, a Sam/Diane or a Ross/Rachel. But if you plan to put the two together, start the process rather than tease one way and pull in the other direction constantly.<br/><br/>All in all, it's not the best comedy on the air, but it's got potential.<br/><br/>***UPDATE ON 2/18/09*** I really hate to think the producers of the show actually read my comment, but all 3 things listed above for the show actually happened. (scary) <br/><br/>1. Probably the biggest thing that happened is that Penny is far more integrated into the group, and the results have paid off huge dividends. More than that, each character has had a show that focused on them, rather than this being strictly the Sheldon/Leonard/Penny show. The results haven't always been effective, but it's good to see the effort.<br/><br/>2. Although Sheldon continues to show signs of sufferability beyond redemption, you see changes in him from season 1. For good references, I suggest the 2nd season episodes "The Bad Fish Paradigm," "The Panty Pinata Polarization," and "The Financial Permeability." Very surprising. (The Bath Gift Item Hypothesis will have you on the floor at the end.)<br/><br/>3. It seems like the show wants to keep Leonard and Penny friends, but still give us the occasional tease. For this, might I recommend "The Bath Gift Item Hypothesis" and "The Maternal Capacitance." This show simply isn't funny at all. Don't believe me? Search "Big Bang Theory sans laugh track" on YouTube or the Internet and watch what you find. See if you can still laugh at the show when the audience is silent. I never cared for this show. I never found it particularly funny or appealing in any way. But I admit, the laugh track does give the illusion that there is some humor present. But take it away and there's just an awkward silence. You might wonder if you're watching some weird drama series.<br/><br/>This show is a total sham. When I first saw The Big Band Theory I liked it a lot. The characters were interesting (Parsons as Sheldon Cooper making the show what it is), the episodes had funny scenarios with overall decent writing. However, by around season four, the jokes were starting the drag and the characters seemed to act more like television actors than real people. I don't mind references to previous gags (e.g. Arrested Development does it amazingly) but there are only so many times I can be reminded that Leonard has lactose intolerance and Raj needs alcohol to talk to women. <br/><br/>Recently, all of the humour comes off as obnoxious rather than humorous. The jokes aren't reworked over the course of the show; they are just copied and pasted to lesser effect. I have noticed that this repetition only highlights the shows weaknesses, even in the stronger episodes<br/><br/>The Big Bang Theory is defiantly not bad, but its more recent seasons feel like inferior re-runs. I'd happily give the first two or three seasons an 8/10, but the four (and more to come no doubt) that come after bring it down to a 6/10. TBBT would have to be one if the most enjoyable shows to hit the box in many years. The writers do a great job with the characters and as the show develops more is possible. The cast do a fabulous job and they are good actors. I have no favourites though thectwo I would like to see developed more are Howard and Raj, the boys, forever planning mischief and both extremely likable though Howard had to grow on me. Sheldon and Leonard are very good and while Sheldon seems a bit unreal Leonard plays a down to earth part that works well for him. It's interesting thatmany peoplexsee it as a show about nerds which is morre a reflection of the brainlessness of today's all show, glamor and vacuousness. Nerds, believe,do get what they want from life because they are are not slaves to every whim passing by. Take not. Penny is great and verynormal Nd likable. If one person dropped out of the cast the show would fall apart. They all contribute to a very funny thoughtful half hour. Recommend and please continue the series. The best thing that could ever happen to my Mondays...This is the perfect sitcom for geek people. Smart dialogues, thousands of references, and strong characters turn this show into a masterpiece. After watching a few episodes, you start to like more and more of the guys. Probably, the main character is Sheldon Cooper, the narcissist genius that we all love. But I prefer Wolowitz better. Howard Wolowitz is a "horny engineer", who tries desperately to attract women, showing the attempt of the writers to make we, the viewers, identify ourselves with the the nerd stereotype of the show.<br/><br/>P.S.: I hope to watch a crossover between TBBT and Two and a Half Men! Who's with me? At last! A show that has everything we've yearned for for so long now! Normal, nerdy, almost down to earth, young, hip, and oh my....HILARIOUSLY FUNNY! Just wanted to put my 2 cents in. I and my family sincerely hope that this show stays on for many more seasons as it always has our family absolutely rolling on the floor with laughter. And a special comment for Chuck Lorre: Every week, we record this show, not only because we have 4 children still living at home and trying to watch anything without a million interruptions, but because we love the part at the end of the show that you write for the audience and because of its length and subject matter we must pause to read carefully. Thank you so much for this one last tidbit of hilarity to get our week off on a great start! I hate most sitcoms. They're predictable, they use stereotypes like a sort of cultural shorthand and rarely are they funny. Actually, that is unless you enjoy one-liners, catch phrases and jokes that are set up with big flashing lights and signs that tell you "Hey! This is funny! Laugh!" <br/><br/>There's very little to laugh about in this sitcom, though it does have its moments. Unfortunately, it appears to focus all its jokes on the incompetence of four socially inept "nerds". The chemistry between them is good but whenever there is any kind of interaction with an external character, they start to get unbearably annoying. I couldn't help thinking how much funnier a show centering on Sheldon (complete with inner monologues) would have been. As it is, he can be likable or loathsome. <br/><br/>Leonard is the main character, though you wouldn't know that because he isn't particularly charming or endearing. He just whines about things and lives with the neurotic Sheldon. I don't know why Leonard puts up with Sheldon's sh*t but he and the other characters do and this usually makes up the storyline of an entire episode. <br/><br/>Raj is a stereotype of the "typical" South Asian guy who is shy around girls and speaks with an accent. Howard is a stereotype of the "typical" desperate Jewish guy who is relentlessly horny but manages to drive away most girls he meets. <br/><br/>Penny (the girl next door) was the only redeeming factor for me. I guess that makes me shallow but I just found her to be a very attractive and wholesome alcoholic. Oh, and she's a stereotype of the dumb blonde. <br/><br/>The laugh track is one of the worst I've heard in any sitcom. It's bad enough that it sounds detached and unrelated to the respective scene, but in this show it's just so loud and obnoxious. <br/><br/>All these shortcomings could be forgiven if there was decent writing involved but that isn't usually the case. The last episode I saw involved Sheldon running away from Penny and Sheldon (who had an argument), Raj (arguing with his parents) and Howard (arguing with his Mum). That was the entire episode. People arguing and Sheldon trying to get away from them. <br/><br/>If you like sitcoms you'll probably like this because it's more of the same. If not, then I'd stay away from this. I thought we had moved on from this kind of "sitcom". There is absolutely no spontaneity with the script or acting and nobody is in the slightest bit believable. I think the script is supposed to be smart but isn't. A long monotone monologue does not = Funny.<br/><br/>Also nowadays a good comedy does not need canned laughter or a "live studio audience with laughter cards held up". I realise great shows such as Seinfeld, Cheers, Frasier and even Friends used canned laughter but that was then. Comedy shows have moved on and we don't need to be told when to laugh anymore. Maybe The Big bang Theory uses more canned laughter than other shows but it just seems unbearable.<br/><br/>Look at shows like The Office, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Scrubs and Modern Family. These are some of the funnies and cleverest shows around at the moment... no canned laughter and every character is totally believable.<br/><br/>On a positive note, I think the actors could all be good in a different show. at first i was sceptical about this show. i wanted to buy it on itunes but some of the reviews were very critical. i decided to check it out on TV. i am so glad i discovered this show. it is a great comedy, and very easily one of the best on TV. i really hope this show doesn't get cancelled.<br/><br/>okay, maybe it is a bit cheesy, but the laughs are pretty much relentless. i really look forward to watching this show. my favourite character is sheldon. the acting is really very good, and very humorous. there is an obvious chemistry between the characters, and they play off each other very well.<br/><br/>great comedy with great writing, great characters and great acting, although nothing less can be expected from chuck lorre. well done, u have delivered yet again. i recommend u try it, u wont regret it I used to enjoy the show, but after a while it got old. They are milking the series dry and it's to the point where I can't stand the show. The Big Bang Theory should've stopped at the 3rd season. The characters are likable, however Howard and Raj get too annoying at times, Sheldon Cooper is the show. How the hell does this show gets an 8.6 rating on IMDb? Am i completely missing the point or what? Without bragging about myself I'm normally known by my friends to have a great sense of humor but this series is just so dumb with almost nothing humorous in it. The characters are so lame and they are actually not even good actors. Almost every character in this series is annoying. You kind of feel the urge to slap them in the face after every line they speak. And the most horrible part of the show is the laugh track. After every single phrase they speak you are apparently obliged to laugh. Well I only laugh or smile when it's funny, I never do on command. And in this show I hardly never laugh because it's just not funny at all. This show is an insult to other comedies. I love this new series, I have laughed in every episode. I love how they use known theories and facts in everyday life situations, they show how being smart can interfere with living among "normal" people and how that fact makes one feel out of place or with less opportunity to achieve happiness as the general population thinks it is. Never the less being a bit smarter than average shows a different perspective on how the world works but not necessarily a distorted one. I do think that a couple of characters are exaggerated in their dress, not all "nerds" are fashion blind. I know he will end up with Penny, all TV series have their couples, but I feel for him, what will they talk about? This has been ine of the best comedy series I have ever seen!! I just started watching it a year ago and have been binge watching every chance I get!! Just seems to be really obvious, boring comedy with uninteresting and dislikeable characters that make you cringe more than they make you laugh It's really hard to believe how this show made it past season 2. Sure there are funny moments from time to time, but upon reflection, these tend to be moments of childishness - these guys act like they're still in grade school so often that it makes them loose credibility as "smart people". They are so culturally insensitive, so unaware about the world outside of their little bubbles in their ivory tower, it makes me wonder how they ever got past college in the first place (after all, you can't graduate with nothing but math and hard science classes, thank goodness). The environment, the economy, politics? These are all foreign terms to the characters in the show. Highly educated and specialized is not the same as smart.<br/><br/>As far as the characters go, how does a rude jerk like Sheldon avoid being slapped, if not beaten up, at least once per season? Intelligent people pay attention to the world around them, but these characters are SO self-absorbed that they become unlikeable within a few episodes. If you want to see a funny show about geeks, I'd recommend "Freaks and Geeks" since it at least acknowledges the wider world...and they don't pretend to be adults.<br/><br/>All in all, the characters are very one-dimensional and shallow. I don't see how even a character like Leonard could hold a relationship with a "normal" person. Ironically it reminds me of the William Shatner song "Common People". Sorry guys but: "You'll never live like common people! You'll never do whatever common people do! You'll never fail like common people! You'll never watch your life slide out of view, and dance, and drink, and screw! Because there's nothing else to do!"<br/><br/>For a show to succeed, the audience needs to be able to relate with the characters. So how, exactly, does this show garner an 8+ rating here? Maybe people watch it just for the opening song, easily the best part of the whole show. This show is one of the most intelligent shows I've ever watched. I know I am adding this review very late, but I've seen every episode of it more than ten times and I thought it was my duty to at least write a review.<br/><br/>Usually in a sitcom, there's one or two people who actually steal the show and the rest are only building up the situation but in The Big Bang Theory, the entire cast has done an absolutely wonderful job. Johnny, Kaley, Simon, Kunal and the best of all, Jim Parsons. Any tom, dick or harry can pull off a Joey or a Barney or a Charlie (I like these shows too ;) ), the same ol womanizing chick-magnet, but pulling off a Sheldon is an extremely difficult job and the amazingly talented Jim Parsons does complete justice to the role.<br/><br/>For those who dislike the show, I did not like it much at first either. A year ago, I was hospitalized and there was no TV in my room. I only had the entire TBBT on my iPod and I had no choice but to watch it. I did not enjoy the first few episodes, but later I totally loved it. You need to watch at least 5 episodes to get attached to the characters and start enjoying their hilarity.<br/><br/>This is one of the best shows ever made. Kudos Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady. The Big Bang Theory is definitely one of the wittiest and, sure enough, smartest shows I have seen. The best thing about it is that albeit an unusual storyline and even more unusual group of people, the show is for real! The biggest amusement comes from the characters, of course! I love their idiosyncrasies and their clumsiness- or is it Sheldon that I'm mostly reflecting on?! Can't be certain... He overpowers the screen when he's in the scene, just because he is so tuned in and turned off at the same time. Penny's character is strong and flirtatious, but just the right dose; she doesn't get them and they don't get her, but they are on the magnetic field every time they are together. I love their inhibitions! I used to like the show before it took the obvious path of least resistance and had it develop like every other sitcom about single people: marriage, children, death (of the show). It should be taken out of it's misery before we start to think of it as the tired old show it has become rather than the fresh and funny show it was. If not we'll soon see stage 4 show-cancer: Terrible child actors. Before watching this show, everyone told me how hysterically funny this show was and how awesome it is. It isn't. I'm sorry. It just doesn't keep my attention at all. The jokes are terrible and not funny at all. I haven't cracked a smile once. Ever. It is terrible. I gave it many tries and like, 34823489523894 strikes, you're out. Other than the occasional game-reference, (which i appreciate because I'm a huge gamer). It seems like an 11 year old kid made up these jokes. And some don't even make sense! If you haven't watched this show, continue to NOT watch it. It's a waste. Like the character Sheldon? WTF? The most annoying character ever created. Don't even give it a chance, I honestly don't know why everyone likes this show; because I have a good sense of humor, and even this didn't make me chuckle. I am a physicist, so I can take two different viewpoints on this show. Firstly this is a sitcom about the lives of a few physicists - this is probably the first TV show ever which really uses physicists as main casts; they are real-world university researchers and not captains on futuristic spaceships or submarines. So no wonder that many graduates students in physics are curious about this show, or so I hear! One point I want to emphasise on that note is that the contents on physics on this show are ALWAYS right; the characters are really working on cutting-edge physics problems. It is good to see that physics is represented correctly. I have not noticed any inconsistencies in the physics that the characters talk about. However by the same token there are funny moments in this show which will probably appeal only to physicists! The second viewpoint is that it depicts physicists as somewhat socially inept and 'indoors-in' geeks. While most of the physicists I know are mostly socially capable, maybe some of them slightly less so than average; I have definitely come across physicists who are like Sheldon or Wolowitz. Leonard is more or less what some normal physicists are like and his lack of having a romantic relationship despite good efforts is also quite a common problem in the pre-tenure physicist life. Finally, Rajesh stereotypes an Indian doctorate physicist working in the West and I have also come across people like him. I think, overall, the stereotyping in this show, although slightly overwhelming, is not totally out of reality. As it seems, you really can not have a sitcom with people who are perfectly normal in every sense. You do not have 'Friends' without Joe, Office(US) without Dwight or Family Guy without Stewie.<br/><br/>As a sitcom I think it is pretty ordinary - the plots are relatively simple and usually predictable, acting is better than average, the jokes are nicely done and you have catchphrases here and there but they are not repeated too many times. Being a physicist I am always curious to watch the new episodes of this show and I will not be surprised if others do not feel the same way. To me watching an episode of this show is like watching a better-acted, less-juvenile episode of 'Friends'. If you can survive through watching many other sitcoms that are on TV at the moment, you will easily survive through this one, maybe possibly like it even. O.k I am a Star wars fan and I am sick of how we inaccurately depicted by the media as nerds. If show was about N.H.L. fan I still don't know if it would be funny. But then it would be more realistic. I know it will be hard for most people to believe this. But this awful show is no funny then a broken computer. It come as shock. I do not care for these comedy shows that have nothing. All they had is a bunch of boring idiots. I may seen hard to believe but this show proves that comedy is easy. As a fan of Godzilla the Star wars movies and Star trek I am offended by this crap. I know this crap is popular crap. People will laugh at any thing. They did give jobs to actors that were in Star wars and Star trek. But still I can't believe people think this is funny. I love the big bang theory - it's one of the smartest, funniest shows ever - but as smart and funny as it is and as wonderful as the characters and the actors who portray them are, there is a problem. It is commonly - at least in my household - referred to as the dreaded Laugh Track Abuse. Whoever came up with the idea that we need to be told when to laugh should be severely chided. Really. Okay, now you might say it's a live audience - but if that's the case, I strongly suspect there is a lack of oxygen in the studio air or something added to it that makes people laugh loudly and hysterically for no reason at all. If the writing is good - and it always has been - there is no reason for a laugh track. We fans are caught up in the story and the laugh track is just distracting. WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD! <br/><br/>As many recent reviewers of the show have pointed out, this used to be fantastic. And what - at least in my view - made it that way was perhaps that it appealed to a more niche audience, to those of who shared at least some of the interests of the protagonists. The comic- book readers, the science 'nerds', the academics, the superhero lovers, the Comic Con goers! The popular culture connection, the delightful weirdness of the main characters and their chemistry were the trifecta that turned this show into a power house. SPOILERS! I'm sad to say that all of these are now non-existent. Gone are the references to comics and superheroes – now it seems the comic book store is only used as another setting for the start of discussions about relationship problems and how being in one means abandoning all of one's interests in order to be accepted by one's partner. No more comparing superhero powers based on scientific evidence, no more of Sheldon's fascination for Mr Spock to the point when the two blend together, no more guest appearances by cult icons. I was heartbroken to see they had even resigned and decided not to go to Comic Con If you were one of those people who hated all those things, though perhaps the show wasn't for you to begin with, you might enjoy it now.<br/><br/>You might think that the characters still have chemistry, but if you take away that side of their personality and also stop writing scripts which credibly portray them as passionate scientists (as used to be the case) it seems to me there's not much left to work with. While Sheldon becoming more of an extrovert was something which fans would perhaps have wanted to see, it wasn't at the expense of sacrificing what made him Sheldon. Raj and Howard's codependent relationship has also lost any comedic potential, especially since it seems like Raj is genuinely suffering while Howard mocks him, while – call me picky – I don't find Stuart's depression, bankruptcy, anxiety and lack of meaning in life amusing at all. Rather, his borderline suicidal personality brings quite a dark, sad dimension to the show and the fact that the other characters seem to mock him whenever they get the chance makes me want to watch anything else but TBBT. To me, it seems like the show is beyond saving and should end in one season at most. But if it does want to retain its oldest viewers it should bring back what made it unique and new – the science references, the physics jokes, the popular culture references and comic book preoccupations. Show life around the campus again, the experiments they're working on (they had something going with the air force experiment, which seems to have come to nothing), make us believe they're physicists and academics again rather than middle-aged soap opera stars. Stop turning this into a second- rate Friends and go back to what worked for the show! I don't know y people find this show good or they called it awesome for me not the same case buyed season 1 after watching episode 1 going straight to garbage. I don't understand all the hype around the show. That's pretty bad I started watching it getting ready to watch The Simpsons on Fox common hour before they show Big Bang Theory it's my first time watching the whole show I have to say it was pretty upsetting. Upsetting with all of the bad jokes, the noxious characters if you know annoying people in real life that you want to escape from this show certainly won't help! Other than that the jokes are too dull and settling dry and sarcastic and they don't even do a good job at being dryer sarcastic it's terrible. I think people are hyped about this show because that girl happens to be blond but she's actually one of the most annoying characters weird I recently returned to this show after many years of not watching it, and was pleased that it is still quite funny. The acting, script and editing are all first-class. Not one line or scene is wasted. But the sets and the characters have unfortunately not changed and the show doesn't take risks with its plots. One thing I hate is its treatment of women. It's good that we now have Bernadette and Amy, both of whom are great, but often they're still portrayed as appendages of their boyfriends, Howard and Sheldon. Yes, the woman now get their own scenes, but they're often talking about the men, not their own issues. And the portrayal of Penny remains problematic. All the guys objectify her. Yes, OK, the joke is that she is a blonde bimbo, but that's getting a bit old. I hate it when the script compares her with Amy - Amy is always seen as a lesser person because she is not as physically attractive as Penny. What sort of example are we setting for young viewers? The gang have now been together in their little apartment complex for 10 years. Big Bang has had a great run for any sitcom. I feel it's time for a major overhaul, or new characters, or a spin- off. Or it might be time to quit while they're ahead. This show is a terrible repeat terrible representation of geeks/nerds. I say this as a comic book fan and film lover and my best friend loves video games and we act nothing like this like at all. The show is Sheldon, Howard,Leonard, Raj,and Penny they are a group of friends and all but penny are super geeks and nerds except for Penny who i guess is supposed to be the inside look. I think that the best character is Howard because he is the closest to a geek but still over the top and to horny and Penny is the worst representation of a female in any media. Only watch this show if you want to see a very very stylized unrealistic look at geeks. The Big Bang Theory is a highly-acclaimed and immensely popular sitcom about a group of intelligent scientists who struggle to cope with their social awkwardness and geeky quirks when a new neighbor shows how truly naive they are to the outside world. A smart and funny twist on the typical boy meets girl story, The Big Bang Theory is a show that everyone can enjoy with its wit and absolutely lovable cast of characters. While the outstanding comedy is what makes the show so immediately enjoyable for the audience, it's the friendships and relationships which keep you watching. The characters are deeply layered, and their personalities are tantalizingly explored beneath their surfaces throughout the story. On another note, the show's scientific accuracy and the cast and crew's devotion and abilities demand tremendous merit. Unlike any other sitcom today, The Big Bang Theory will make you laugh, cry, and will win your heart, and it is well on its way to making smart the new sexy. 8.9/10 There is nothing funny about this. It is just stupid and boring. Yep, yep, and yep.... This might be the worste show I've attempted to watch.... So bad... When I started watchin eleven years ago, I was seduced by the idea of the young blond humble lady being mixed with nerds that think they are so clever that they are dumb in everyday situations. There was a perfect chemistry as both world respected one another and all the actors were convincing in their very specific roles.
As the years went by, I got used to these characters who were nearly real to me. Today, for anyone who wouldn´t have watched from the beginning, it wouldn´t have much interest as most jokes and the energy that was there is fading away. So it is more about giving an end to the story. Fortunately, it is announced that the latest season is the last one. Before watching this for the first time I was cautiously optimistic that this was going to be a mildly amusing. Unfortunately after several episodes I found myself despising this piece of absolute garbage. None of the jokes seemed to be funny in the slightest, asking myself where is the joke? This comes before the laugh track where I swear the people in that audience are on laughing gas or something, I'd certainly find it more amusing with some. While watching I thought 'yeah they're supposed to be annoying to a degree' while later thinking 'not that annoying surely!' The characters are just tired caricatures which would be fine if they were funny and this were a half decent spoof but it isn't. It's like they're trying to be painted as original characters but are just hopelessly bad at being funny. Despite this frustration it is not the worst sitcom on TV just a bad one really. I can think of some notable ones we have in Britain that are much worse, but that's another review. In summary don't watch it, I thought it had something but ended up having little to none of it. This is one of the worst shows of all time without a doubt. I have seriously no clue how this show is popular. It doesn't deserve awards and nominations, it doesn't deserve the praise, it deserves to be crapped on and very few people do that. So let me tell you why this show is ungodly awful.<br/><br/>The biggest complaint I have is that it's not funny. None of the jokes are funny even though a studio audience laughs at the jokes. But it feels like they are forced at gunpoint to laugh or else someone dies. I only laughed once. ONCE. One episode, I don't remember what it was, but it was the only joke in this horribly written show that I laughed at. ONCE ONLY.<br/><br/>The show's views of Nerds and Nerd Culture is extremely hostile and negative. I remember one episode where one of the guys was completely sexist to his girlfriend and was too busy focused on something else. NERDS DON'T DO THAT! Nerds Care! Nerds don't act like total A-Holes! I'm a nerd and care about a lot of things but this is offensive and awful.<br/><br/>How about the characters? We got a blatant racist stereotype which makes me bang my head whenever I see him. The others are just so atrociously written. The references are not funny, the nerd slang is not funny, NOTHING IS FUNNY.<br/><br/>If you want to watch a show that positively portrays nerds, Watch Community. It's a funny show with possibly one of the greatest written characters of all time. THIS SHOW SUCKS. Don't listen to the people who give on going praise! STAY AWAY!<br/><br/>7/100 F I'm giving this 8 out of 10 purely because of the first few seasons. Because I'm a UK fan, we get the new episodes ages after they come out in the US, so rather than keeping up with it week by week, I tend to watch some of the ENDLESS re-runs on E4. I won't lie, it does work, it's still quite entertaining to watch after many viewings - I've seen the episode where Sheldon's WoW account is hacked millions of times.<br/><br/>But I can tell when an episode is relatively new. And I don't like the new ones. In the opening seasons, I felt the stories were so much more focused around the 4 geeks, which was funny. Penny is a good character too, and she contrasts well with Sheldon especially. There was a point when I absolutely adored this show.<br/><br/>But then what happened? They all went and got girlfriends. We could all see Leonard and Penny's eventual romance from a mile off, and I don't have a problem with that. I loved the first time Leonard asked Penny out, and I think their relationship works in the show.<br/><br/>However, then we had Howard and Sheldon get their girls. Howard married Bernadette and Sheldon is now boyfriend of Amy Farrah Fowler. My problem with this is that these new characters have now taken a lot of the light off the friendship of the 4 men and focused more on the women. I was watching one the other day, where there was a separate plot line for the women. This wouldn't be bad at all, if more than a third of the female characters were actually funny. I originally liked Bernadette, but not anymore. I never liked Amy Farrah Fowler, she is mostly used as a vessel for just very crude jokes, and she comes across really as a female Sheldon, but not as funny of course. <br/><br/>But the very worst part is it seems to have changed the male characters - in particular Sheldon. He just seems to have mellowed a bit and I far preferred his character in the earlier seasons.<br/><br/>But, contrary to what it may seem, I DO LIKE this show. It is nice, easy viewing and some of it is still funny. I realise the writers do have to develop the character's lives a bit in order to keep things fresh, but I just preferred the earlier seasons. Imagine "Mash" but with Frank Burns elevated from supporting character/villain to co-lead, but with all his nastiness and irritating qualities intact. That's what we have with Big Bang Theory. Sheldon is such a grating, irritating person, and that would be fine if he were, like Burns, a minor player. But Sheldon is a lead, and his negativity brings down the whole show, and not in a fun way. In one episode, he said if he could afford to live alone, he'd kick his friend out. "I value our friendship too," Leonard said sarcastically, although the comment was interesting in that it drew attention to an obvious flaw in the show. Why are these two guys friends at all? Also the show must work hard to invent reasons to pair up the guys with the cute girl across the hall. There's no reason for interaction, so the show must do some narrative gymnastics to bring them together, and it strains credibility. When I first saw this show, I thought it was alright. But it really grew on my as I watched it. The characters are relatable and funny and the plots are unique! Its basically about two socially awkward physicists, Sheldon and Leonard who live across the hall to their attractive neighbour Penny. Sheldon and Leonard have two other friends, Howard (Engineer) and Raj ( Astro-Physicist). As with most series, the first few series were better but I still cannot get enough of it!!! It's another stroke of genius by Chuck Lorre. Its definitely one of the best (if not the best) comedy shows on TV. Each episodes ends with you dying to watch more. The jokes are witty and you always learn something new each episode. I would recommend this to anyone aged 8+. I hope this helps! I ought to write this review as two parts to give credit where it's due. Seasons 1-4 being the first and the later seasons as the second.<br/><br/>The first 4 seasons of this show are nothing short of great with few bad or mediocre episodes. The jokes are smart and tend to be witty. In terms of character development, it is evident that Howard, Raj and Leonard grow as they enter new relationships. Sheldons character is one of a kind and adds a great contrast to the others who are attempting to make their way up the social ladder of coolness, whereas Sheldon is very much stuck to his ways. The acting is good but sometimes falling into the trap of being forced. If this show were to stop airing after this season, I would rate it a solid eight.<br/><br/>The latter 2 series are what have let the show down entirely. The characters nerdy side have appeared to taken the back seat and mere toilet humour has been put in it's place. <br/><br/>Unfortunately it has to be said that this show has sacrificed its charm in the hopes of securing a larger audience, which, in my eyes, has meant that the show has lost its charm. After Max Headroom was unceremoniously canceled in 1988, I figured that the unwashed mass called "prime time TV audience" would never "get" anything more intellectually stimulating than 90210. Imagine my surprise when this show came to the air...and lasted a whole season! I recorded and watched the whole season with a friend of mine yesterday, and we agreed, the nerds are an amalgam of nerdness: one show, they're into Lord of the Rings, another show, they're into programming computers, another show, they're into Halo, another show, they're into Star Trek, another show, they're into Klingon Boggle, another show, they're into comics, another show, they're into robots. I don't think you could really have a show where the nerds were really nerds: real nerds are into the few specific nerdnesses that appeal to each individual nerd. Having a show with realistic nerds would be too boring for workability. This is, in fact, one of the minor problems with the scripts. The nerds are into a wide and interesting variety of things, yet Penny often comments that they "don't have a life". I love the asynchronous conversations about various physics and nerd-dom topics, though. They're exactly like the conversations I had with my nerd-friends when I was that age. And still do. So I love it. And I'm glad they made it a full season! That means DVDs! (With commentary!) Definitely recommended. For nerds, fer sure. Cringe comedy with irritating cast thank god it's almost over Rubbish boring feeble dry unimaginative stupid lame This show isn't funny, has terrible acting and is the dumbest show on television. A once very promising and fresh TV series, that after season 4 started slowly but steadily going down the drain becoming another mediocre "relationships" soap...<br/><br/>The main characters, on which the whole original concept was based are taking almost secondary roles in the last seasons and their idiosyncrasies which were the whole point of the show were "polished" and gradually phased out. <br/><br/>All in all, a show that has been transformed into something completely different from what it started, and than has now turned into a 100% relationships soap. Thing is, that in that genre there are far better shows to watch, which mind you, started as such from the beginning!<br/><br/>Again, really shame, first seasons were really good.... Many of my friends recommended this show because it is very funny. The high IMDb rating and positive comments made me go out there and see all of them. Yes, I saw 2 complete seasons and all the ongoing S3 episodes. The pilot did not have the same effect on me like How I Met Your Mother. I barely laughed and found the jokes weird. Could it be because this show is cliché after cliché? Most probably. Geeks with no life try to meet women. It is not like we haven't seen this before. Most of the time this is poorly implemented and not funny. In all my marathon I can count on one hand the episodes where I laughed a bit. I won't criticise acting because all of them have talent. Sheldon's portrayal takes skill and is perfect. Obsessive, compulsive, neurotic, you name it. Back to the show per se. When you see so many episodes in a row you kind of notice repetitions. Most of the episodes begin with them eating Thai food and how Sheldon's bowel movements need to be done at a very specific time. Leonard tries to be cool but utterly fails every he talks to Penny. She is the cute face in the show trying to complement the guys with her stupidity. The chemistry is not bad between her and Sheldon but ...not very funny most of the time. This show is supposed to be a comedy and in my view it needs to take notes from the producers of how I met your mother.<br/><br/>Bottom line, A lot of noise for nothing. Wow this show is so unclever it's depressing. It's depressing that such an audience exists for something so dumbed down and unfunny. Not a single effort was put into this show and not a single effort was put into making this show more than one-note. What a bore. I thought Peter Griffin was the most annoying and unlikeable TV character currently on the air. Having been introduced to Sheldon Cooper, I will have to revise my opinion.<br/><br/>My family *loves* this program, though I fail to see what makes it special. The main male characters are cartoonish stereotypes of twenty-first century nerds. "Geeks", "nerds" and "betas" (take your pick of a slang word for a smart yet unhip individual) sure do *love* their video games and comic books! They are socially awkward, and know nothing about how to mingle with the in-crowd. This stereotype is fairly new in American culture, but it's been beaten to death so many times that depictions of characters that meet these stereotypes cause me to yawn. "Big Bang Theory" relies on these stereotypes for 100% of its humor. Added to this is another stereotype, this one of the above-average-but-not-a-genius girl whose role is to teach the socially inept nerds how to fit into society. She serves as the foil and audience surrogate, though I found her character to be just annoying as the nerds she's supposed to teach. <br/><br/>The trite stereotypes are bad enough, but the arrogant attitude of the show's protagonist, Sheldon Cooper, makes the show unwatchable most of the time. Yeah, the stock character of the nerd is supposed to be smart and socially awkward, but he is also supposed to be charming and endearing. Sheldon is a narcissist who thinks he is above everyone else, including his university colleagues. He is utterly condescending, rude, unkind, and lacks even the most basic modicum of empathy. These traits are supposed to be "quirky", but instead they make him come off as a repulsive jerk who *should* be shunned not only by the "cool" people, but by his fellow nerds as well. Yeah, Steve Urkel was a weird genius geek with a talent for robotics and nuclear physics, but he seldom put anyone with an lQ lower than his down. He was kind and sweet-natured towards the average-IQ Winslow family, and treated everyone around him with respect. Sheldon loves to lord his intelligence over everyone around him, and his arrogance blinds him to his own flaws, weaknesses and gaps in knowledge. Rather than learn from his mistakes and become a better person, he remains the same smug, cold-hearted jerk week after week. He may be a genius at physics, but he feels knows "everything" about "everything" as well. He treats his girlfriend, a biologist from the university, with the same arrogance he treats everyone else. The biologist girlfriend likes him for his brain, but fails to see Sheldon's more negative traits as hindrances to a lasting relationship, including his utter lack of emotional intelligence. Why any sane woman would want to stay with a guy like this is beyond me; the biologist girl (played by Blossom) is way too good for the likes of him!<br/><br/>The shows stretches my suspension of disbelief beyond what I can accept. If the men on the show really are Cal Tech faculty members, they would not waste their free time worrying about the minutiae of comic book characters; as other reviewers have said, they'd instead focus their minds on mashing and smashing the atom. I might like the show more if Sheldon and his colleagues (I hesitate to call them his "friends", as his cold demeanor seems to preclude any real warm bonds with other human beings) focused their time on physics experiments instead of World of Warcraft games or debates about comic book characters. Urkel may have been a fanciful character, but he loved science so much that he didn't have time to devote to any other hobbies. For persons who brag about their intellect, I've yet to see Sheldon and his colleagues do anything related to science in their apartment or on campus. Sorry to say this, but I doubt that grown geniuses in their thirties would devote most of their free time to hobbies best left to younger men, like comic books or RPGs, and that they would do so to the exclusion of more intellectual pursuits. Their immature personalities and petty squabbling also make them more akin to five-year-old children rather than adult men. They argue over stupid, trivial stuff and whine like babies when they don't get their way. It's a pain to watch, but my family *loves* the show.<br/><br/>My advice is to watch reruns of "Family Matters" instead of "Big Bang Theory." Urkel seems like more a real scientist than anyone on "The Big Bang Theory," and his personality is more likable and realistic, in spite of "The Big Bang Theory" writers' pathetic attempts at verisimilitude. I hope someday Jaleel White guest-stars as "Professor Steven Q. Urkel" on "The Big Bang Theory," and participates in a Jeopardy-like competition with Sheldon, and beats him badly. If that happened, I might like "Big Bang Theory" a little more; as the show stands, it's fairly unwatchable. Used to like it. Then I realised it just wasn't funny, and too many laugh track began to annoy me Leonard is an obnoxious prick.
Howard is funny but can be a tool at times.
Sheldon is the reason why I watch this crap.
Raj is meh.
Bernadette is a c···. I can't stand this ho and her emasculating nature.
I wish Howard would punch her in the face and shut her up.
Amy was funny when she first started but as the seasons progress
her more human character gets more gayer than f···.
Penny has a nice booty.<br/><br/>1-8 seasons were good but they started getting more "woke" and the broads were becoming increasingly unlikable especially Bernadette and her irritable high tone voice. Overall, not a bad run. BBT was an intelligently scripted show. I found the lack of animal welfare absolutely disconcerting i.e. various references to experimentation on animals, baiting live worms, using pregnant fish as "hilarious" examples of gutting one, references to veal and blowing up ducks-VERY disturbing.<br/><br/>Sure, the show is smart and these guys are perfect in comedic timing etc. but Jesus, the distinct lack of animal welfare/consideration on the show is not only disturbing but very, very sad. The best sit-com i've ever watched. Thank you for 12 wonderful, funny, incredible, fantastic and amazing years!!! TBBT used to be a good show, but that was before it became "The Sheldon Cooper Show" and they turned Sheldon into a full-fledged egotistical narcissist. The last few years of TBBT I watched mainly out of hope to see someone, anyone, knock Sheldon's teeth out. Instead everyone put up with his bullying, always caving to his constant wants and whining. The terrible spin-off, Young Sheldon, treats little Sheldon the same way, like they're afraid to put him in his place or correct him because he's "so smart." That's half of grown-up Sheldon's problem; his parents never disciplined the obnoxious little twerp. I know it's wishful thinking, but I truly hope they kill off Sheldon in the final episode (crushed in the elevator, perhaps?). No more Sheldon and little threat of there ever being another HORRIBLE spin-off series. I've seen a lot of Big Bang Theory, and now I can't watch it anymore, the characters are so horrible to each other, and the misogyny is rampant.
It's all just glossed over with a laugh track. It all leaves a bitter taste in my mouth these days. Just seems to be what laymen think "nerds" are like.<br/><br/>the women seem to be looked down upon by the men.<br/><br/>it is hard to find sympathy for the characters as they are obnoxious. I have gave 2* just because they tried..., this TV show is like, "check your messages" ha ha ha, "ok I will" ha ha ha. From season 8, the quality has decreased significantly.
It's just not funny anymore. The action is enforced.
Luckily, the series ends with season 12. To describe the poor quality of this show in two words: laugh track.
Remove it, and you'll see how lame the jokes are. As bad as any of the jerkwads in Friends were this cast takes it to a whole new level. <br/><br/>Popularity of this show must be the most prominent modern day proof of the "million flyes can't be wrong". Canned laughter for "jokes" by people who should've never been left alone with Microsoft Word. <br/><br/>The show is just so incredibly lame and without any connection to actual "nerds". There is a special place in hell for Chuck Lorre and it probably involves him having to watch his own shows. What a massive hack. The way this show makes jokes at the expense of someone with a mental disability is absolutely VULGAR! These writers need to be fired and banned from ever writing for TV or movies again! Of course they never claim that Sheldon is mentally challenged so that they can get away with making fun of such a person (but it's absolutely obvious that the guy playing Sheldon was directed to play the character this way!) THIS IS ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE!!! This show is utter hatred disguised as a comedy and needs to go away! As a person with a mental disability I say this: MAKING FUN OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES IS VILE, DISGUSTING AND BIGOTED! If you enjoy this show then you're promoting the stigma that surrounds those with mental disabilities and all I have to say to you about that is, "SCREW YOU!" This show is just horrible overall. There is no significant plot line, for starters, and the jokes are terrible. To understand the humor you have to be at least in high school, and that is very prejudiced against any one below high school level. Besides the jokes requiring a certain amount of knowledge to understand, they are not very funny. Every episode has a different plot, so you switch the 50th episode with the 76th, no one would notice. The girlfriend of the Leonard isn't very hot either. She's like a 6. Would not bang. If you want to watch a good show I recommend Operation Repo. It's got a lot of action, pretty characters, and it is unscripted, showcasing the actors' amazing improvisational skills. Going to relive the big bang of life, now it 's hard to find the complete video resources! But even watching some clips can still evoke memories! I remember that I went to watch this drama for the purpose of learning English after being recommended by my teacher. The result was uncontrollable, and I seem to have got used to their speaking style! I like the relaxed atmosphere of this drama, and envy the protagonists who can live together. Those who work hard outside should be particularly envious!<br/><br/>Of course, Xie's ears are my favorite, and he likes his seriousness, his righteous words, his smile can always poke me! But this is not just a comic comedy, its rendering of friendship rather than affection makes me feel warm and warm! Every time I look at it, I feel that the world is so beautiful! You will find the sweet love, funny life, and the touching story. This show made me interested in science. Since I watched this show my physics grades are better. It made me realize how important physics is for the world. Before I watched this show I told my teacher that I will never try to understand it and I will never like it. This show is great. I don't get why people are giving it bad reviews. If this show made teenagers like science I think it reached its goal. I am only one of the examples. I have watched the whole series now for the fourth time and still amazes me in so many ways. And I love it more and more with every episode. May the force be with you! Live Prosper and Thrive 🖖🏻 The Big Bang Theory started out as a fresh unique tv series on the market. The plot was originally attractive and the characters relatable. The dialogue was funny and I enjoyed a lot the first seasons until it reaches a point where it's just stretching out the plot and creating plots and scenes for no logical reason and it just lost touch with what it was. I found myself watching the last seasons just because I've come this far so why not watch the rest. It just stopped working for me but still gets a good note because I truly enjoyed it in the beginning. I remember when this show first aired, I immediately loved it. It was interesting, odd, unusual and very, very funny.
Over time I came to recognise the brilliance of the whole show, the actors of course, but in particular the writing, the extraordinary commitment to character, the respect for the scientific world that it allowed us to glimpse and reminded us to admire.
I can't think of another sitcom which even occasionally inspired awe at the universe in all its complexity.
Twelve years is an extraordinary run, and it was only possible because of the sustained writing quality, never hampered by any unwillingness to let the characters develop, but always respectful of who they already were. Their journeys were real and believable.
I just finished the last of the final series, and I want to pay tribute to the entire team, but especially to the writers, who cared enough for a viewer like me to ensure the arc of all of the characters, to give them, in the knowledge that we wouldn't see them again, the futures I would want for them all. Even finally showing some love for Stuart, ensuring his future happiness along with everyone else.
The final show had me in predictable, but nonetheless genuine tears. Sheldon's realisation of the value of his friends to him and his work, and by extension his recognition of the true nature of humans and how we operate and achieve within the world we inhabit was truly a worthy denouement. Hats off and thank you. Great characters, great acting. Loved every minute of it.
Such a shame it's finished, we'll miss it! I love this show! It start out a little weird and funny, but just builds up to be amazing and relatable. The characters grows with time and finds a way into your heart. I will watch it over and over again. Heartwarming and loveble. Perfection! Funniest show. I loved every episode. This show appeals to the PhD and the high school student.
I legit shed a tear at the series finale This turned out to be my absolute favourite TV show of all time. A common complaint is that its quality diminished after the first few seasons. But I honestly didn't feel that. I really enjoyed every episode and every season. First I watched short clips of BBT on YT or FB. Totally addicted. Then I downloaded and watches each & every season & episode. Believe me when I was watching 12th season last episode I actually cried out soo loud. My tears didn't stop. I felt like I lost someone I adore and someone so close to me. Never felt this feeling for any other TV series before. Still my heart asked more episodes. Why JIM you wanted to quit 😭<br/><br/>This show made me realised how friendship is important in our lives and how to hang together what ever happenes. Friendship is so beautiful.<br/><br/>Also, this show is beautifully written by the team. All characters are developed at the end of the show. Sheldon becomes a person who can understand others feelings in some way. Leonard becomes a confident person. Penny becomes a successful strong woman. Amy comes out of the shell and understand her and others well. Howard becomes creepy to honorable person. Raj improves his self confidence. Bernie becomes successful and strong caring woman.
All the characters developed their qualities with the help of their friends and their support. Each other supports each individual to grow. This is so beautiful to watch 😍<br/><br/>@new ppl who's looking for reviwes before watching BBT - oh hell you got a good tv series ahead of you. Watch it. Every damn episode is great in its own way. You'll fallen in Love with each and every character. Totally recommend it. I'll rate 10/10.<br/><br/>Love you all 😍
Sheldon, Penny, Leonard, Amy, Howard, Raj, Bernie. Your friendship is awesome and hilarious.
Stuard, Kripke you two made us laugh so hard.
Mrs Cooper, Lenny's mom & dad, Penny's father, Bernie's father & Other characters - you all did your part best to make this series go well.
Love you all.
One of the best TV series I've watched. Ending was so perfect. Still I hope you create more episodes. Also, I wanted to see Raj's marriage.
(Better ending than anyother Tv series. You know what I'm telling 😉) True series lovers often criticize an average American TV series to be crude, repetitive, over-sexed and simply unimaginative. The Big Bang Theory was an exception. It was brilliant, insightful, increased your knowledge. Unlike Friends, TBBT was not a sex-con with crude jokes. It was a promising series. Perhaps the best series of all times. A series based on Geeks and Nerds. A series essentially built on science and friendship.<br/><br/>But all that went to hell after 4 seasons. The last 8 seasons of the show are about silly love triangles, typical marriage problems, ridiculous relationship troubles, and insufferable crude jokes - basically it circles back to the dumb over-sexed TV show that most American series are.<br/><br/>I wish I could give me less than 1 stars. If you are an intelligent viewer don't get suckered into it. It is AWFUL. Our days it's a very rare to meet proper story ending. But BBT cast & crew made a grate job. It's the end of an era. I'm very grateful for what TBBT has brought me, the greatest joy, the growth of every beloved character and most importantly, the enthusiasm of life. Sadness aside, I am very glad to know Sheldon & Amy have won their Nobel Prize, Leonard & Penny have got their smart and beautiful baby, the looks of Howard & Bernadette children and the sad truth that Raj's still alone. But perhaps it's for the best to have some imperfections so I can just picture it of all possibilities. Farewell, the finally repaired elevator, the last name 'Hofstadter' of Penny, the whole 'our babies will be smart and beautiful' thing. So harsh that the only thing that actually stays the same is that things are always changing, except for the love of you, The Big Bang Theory.# Wow, I still can't believe it's over...
When I started watching This show (about 6 months ago) I really didn't expect it to be very good (especially because of the IMDb score) but the from the first episode I realized what a great show this is, so I just came here to read the newest user reviews to find out why the score is not higher?! I read them and most of them said that the series is great only until the end of season 5 and they were claiming that after that there's a rapid downhill...
When I read that I got sad because the subject of this sitcom is so great and will the show gonna be a trash after the 5th season?!
So I watched this series until the end of the 5th season (and it really was awesome!)
But when I started watching the 6th season I didn't see any downhills! and even the 7th season and 8th season were also really great!
But only 9th season was just a bit weaker than the previous seasons but they really make that up in season 10 and 11 that were really hilarious and just amazing.
But the 12th season (the last season), it was only just fine...
But the last episode (40 mins) was again so great and awesome, especially the ending that really impressed me. wow, I really loved that ending that it made me cry and now I'm very sad that I watched this sitcom so quickly and fast...
If I want to sum it up, This series is just SO AWESOME! although it had its ups and downs but it still worths watching, and in my opinion it's just one of the best sitcoms ever made!!! This show is for people who like complicated jokes. also people with scientific background would be more likely to grasp most of the jokes. It's still great even in 2019 in its 12th season. Watched every single episode and still love it ! Sheldon is one of my favorite characters ever ! Let's start this little review stating that Kaylee Cuoco can't act. She's just a pretty face.
Program used to be funny until they all get married, then producers dropped the ball and the show went from a 8 (should be a 9 but Kaylee really can't act), to a 6.
Can't crack a laugh during the whole episode I think the episode is racist. It constantly makes fun of India or Indians with that Indian guy receiving the most idiotic dialogues. The Christian southern boy is obviously shown as the prodigy even though many of southerners are still rude to non-whites. The Jew guy of course has to be street smart..he has to be the most successful as the writer-director is Jew and only mild jokes are aimed at them. Whole world is after Yoga and meditation from a country called India but there is never any decent comment on India, never any proper history any respect but nonsense continuously aimed at it. Extremely racist when most research/PhD in USA is done by Asians as American kids don't want to do any hard work. Whatever people say and however they try to justify it but the died after season 3. I tried watching season 4 but could not bear the annoying new characters they introduced. Not only these 2 new characters were extremely intolerable themselves but they ruined 2 best characters of the show Sheldon and Howard. I eventually gave up and sropped watching. I think the writers could have made many more plots with the existing characters themselves. There was no need to introduce these new characters so early on the show and giving them same space as rhe main characters.
But thanks for ruining the brilliant show which could have been the greatest sitcom of all rime. It is annoying to read all these comments like "seasons 1-5 (etc) are great but it started to be awful after that because they had to add romantic relationships." Why so much hate for woman characters? It's normal and in everyone life to have relationships and if there isn't any, that is strange. They had to add those relations because it is necessary for show. The first 4-5 seasons were good, the jokes made me laugh and the comedy behind was also good.
When they had started to introduce relationships drama and the girls, it went down the toilet pretty fast. The final seasons are dramas of utopian relationships, characters like Bernadette become inflexible and rought, the jokes are bad and the laughing just halted. During the final season I actually wanted it to end fast so I can move on......Sad how it shifted from the original ideea to a drama show between impossible relationships How can you make a show that has a slpw,beautiful character evolution?
That's how
Everybody is flawed
Everbody has a problem
But the characters compromise
They complete each other
Nothing becomes perfect at once
The series is not about "leonard and the hot girl" and doesn't culminate with him marrying the hot girl in the last episode but rather trying to make thier relationships work
Everyone of them trying to fix his life
People complete and support each other
Good induction of science
A beautoful show that was a beautiful part of my day
I wished it was longer
And somehow I wished if they had a method of contact or a fan mail
I would have thanked them for the times of joy they gave me
And maybe I will one day Sheldon Cooper constantly makes fun of Howard because he does not have a doctorate. However, if you pay attention over the years all the projects that Howard was involved in could have net him at least 10 PhD's. He works at JPL and Sheldon Raj and Leonard all work at CalTech. All Howard has to do is enroll as a graduate student, write a PhD proposal for his next major project, the school would approve and grant him the degree at the end of the project. It is mostly paperwork, since he has to write proposals and reports anyway. Since JPL is NASA, he could probably get NASA to pay for it all (CalTech is private, so that means very expensive, especially with their staff loaded with Nobel Laureates). In his one upmanship with Sheldon having a dozen doctorates should win. Like many engineers, he does not see the need for additional education when he gets plenty on the job, but it would help with pay raises and promotions as well as shutting up Sheldon which is the biggest accomplishment of all. The first few seasons of The Big Bang Theory I found to be ok, nothing great but it was a decent comedy about socially deprived weirdos trying to fit in. It had problems, but overall the show was fine. But at some point the show became an unfunny mess, with flat characters, and desperate attempts to get viewer attention, with sudden and sporadic moves. In my opinion the show just went on for to long, and the main idea of the show was just to simple to continue for twelve long years. This is best shown with a few changing aspects of how the show was presented. To begin the focus on romance, and the drama around it was a detriment to the shows writing, and was a clear attempt to keep audiences attention. In the first few seasons while romance was an element it never was a key component, in later seasons it was one of the driving forces of the shows writing. Now this alone Isn't bad, but so many of the shows romance conflicts are, simply put, really, really, stupid. Leonard and Penny, have such a toxic relationship, it makes you question why they're still in a relationship. For example, Leonard getting into an episode long argument with Penny because she makes more money than him, just for it to be never brought up again, is not only pointless, but just makes Leonard look petty and annoying for no reason. Or when Leonards girlfriend in earlier seasons (Raj's sister I think), doesn't want her parents to find out She's dating Leonard because he's white. Or when Raj allows his Parents to Arrange a wedding with a person that neither the audience or Raj has ever met before, because of how lonely he is, Which is not only incredibly sad, not only incredibly stupid since Raj has been very outspokenly against getting married like this, But is also pointless since the wedding is broken off at the end of the season, with no consequence to Raj or any other character in the show. The romantic writing remains that bad through the rest of the show. In my own opinion the worst change in the show is Sheldon's Character change. In the first few seasons of the show while Sheldon is more odd than any other cast member, he still comes off as a human being just more scientific. But later in the show Sheldon becomes a cartoon character. he becomes way more strict and far more angry, and acts like a child far more often. this would be fine if this was some kind of side character that doesn't get much attention, but Sheldon is not only the main source of conflicts, following relationships, but also becomes the main character at some point since the series finale is about him, and his accomplishments, completely sidelining every other character. some of what he has done is as follows: bringing his friend bodily harm by making him wear an ichy sweater that gives him massive rashes to simulate how he feels when something is slightly out of order, telling his friends their profession is either stupid or pointless, getting so agitated for being forced to apologize to his boss for an action that was entirely his fault, that he becomes a social recluse and makes his own apartment his workplace, which deeply effects his roommate (Leonard), showing no love or compassion towards his girlfriend (Amy), Ended at least two of his friends relationships, complained because his friend chose his girlfriend over him when going on a massive trip, and did not care that two of his closet friends were having children (in one case he even acted negatively), and I am confident I missed a lot of awful things he has done. Overall (if you hadn't already guessed) I deeply dislike this show. It is good for a quick laugh. The characters aren't that interesting (apart from Sheldon) but the dialogue and their antics make it funny. I absolutely love the show it's awesome so funny. There are two things that get me annoyed. The first thing is, why when we have someone who isn't a white person the race jokes start to come in? Yes indeed the actors are only reading a script but could you imagine if the writers wrote something about a person who isn't white? I get a strong feeling the people who write the show are democratic. And finally how can anyone put up with Sheldon ? He's so annoying. Am glad later on the shows characters were balanced out and not focused as much on Sheldon. 7/10 without race joke 9/10. From start enjoyed alot gang of 5 but after adding more Female unsuitable casting.. even don't know how to act start boring me... Oh My God, how much I like Big Bang Theory. It's just really well done. The actors are perfect (especially Jim Parsons and Kunal Nayyar), the plot is great, comic scenes are great. One little thing that i don't really like is Mellisa Rauch's character - Bernardette. But still very, very fun show. If you didn't yet, give it a try, you won't regret it!<br/><br/>Definetly 10/10 All I wanted from the show is to see sheldon showing his emotions and when he did it he blow us away. Kinda sad that big bang has ended, but loved the 12 amazing seasons. The show is amazing, the themes are bright and up to date, contemplate how various strands of the nerd word. A comedy is light and contagious, and an engaging story makes you want to marathon. The show was much more complete with Amy and Bernadete, starring women and encouraging a career of scientists. Sheldon's transformation of his feelings and how to treat peaple around his was brilliant, or his Nobel Prize speech closed a series in a notorious way. The downside is Penny quitting her acting career, despite being well in the phamaceutical industry, several times she sais that doesn't like to do her job. There was a negative message for fans who dream as a career in acting. Another question its about the Raj end. The of all characters he is the most passionate. There was several dates, one could have worked. Its a shame he broke up alone. The people who say it isn't funny don't have a sense of humor. This show is extremly funny, and the characters are symphatic. I don't think Sheldon is annoying. He definietly has some kind of autism (or maybe Asperger's-syndrome). I can understand him, because I'm an autist too. His character development is amazing. Stuart is probably the most unlikeable character, but he rarely appears. It's been a while since I moved on after the last episode searching for a new serie to follow but I've got to admit still didn't find anything near this masterpiece I usually would say best part the was 1-5 seasons. After i stayed to watch all 12 episodes build-up to the end, i'm clad to say, it was totally worth it. I've watched a lot of movies/serials but i've never wanted to cry in the end. Very-very well planned ending for the serial played with very-well talented actors. Voters who voted less that 10 points, obviously have'nt seen from first to the end episode in row. Well done There aren't any words to describe my feelings for this show... It's everything. Until they remained single and were just dating things were good but the moment the relationships turned serious everything started going to the drain. One more complaint I have is , being an Asian-Indian I was very happy to see a major character on the American Sitcom but they made him a fruit salad and turned him to a butt of joke. Sheldon's character until he met Amy was brilliant with shades of Mr.Bean. And I also find Leonard's character aping Jack Tripper from Threes Company sometimes. This may have something to do with Penny(Kaley Cuoco) who earlier had experience of working with John Ritter. I wish this series don't ever get to an end but everything ebd at some time..best sitcom ever It's ok
Relatively entertaining. 5-6 seasons would have made sense. I'm really surprised they did 12. It got more boring when they all got girlfriends, so almost immediately. If it weren't for Sheldon they could have stopped at season two I guess. He's the only character worth watching, the rest are rather dull in my opinion, sometimes so pathetic, they're irritating, especially the boys. Maybe there's something behind that I don't know, but why 3/4 of the scenes is around them playing with food? eating a cherry tomato each every 20 minutes.
The scientific facts are fun and interesting. The first few seasons were great but over time, I lost track of the show and stopped watching. I went back to it recently and watched from the very beginning. It was just as fun as I remembered it. The show stayed true to its initial premise but managed to reinvent itself repeatedly, over time. Jim Parsons is perfect as Sheldon. He is quite the comic genius and I keep wondering how he doesn't just crack up in every scene. Johnny Galecki as Leonard is a great support to Sheldon and his chemistry with Kaley Cuoco (Penny) is so convincing. I love Simon Helberg as Howard Wolowitz and Kunal Nayyar as Rajesh Koothrapalli. They are funny and quite likable. Melissa Rauch and Mayim Bialik were very good in their roles too.<br/><br/>The comedy in the script is one of my favorite things about this show and that, paired with the comic timing of these actors really put this show on some other level. No wonder this was such a long-running show. I will be watching this one again and again. If u watch until season 11 is very good show. but if u start waching season 12 u just prey for the end. worst indian woman acteress i ever seen. just skip when she played This show brought smile to my face every single time. The first few seasons of this show were really great since we got to meet the main characters of the show but after some time the running gags took over the show and it became almost a parody of itself. I can't even remember most of the plot of the last seasons since nothing really happened. The last few episodes were overall a really good wrap up of the show and it got very emotional in the final episode. Overall it's a good show that suffer from the sitcom trope of nothing ever happening except in the first and last episode of a season, it's good if you watch the reruns on tv but i would not really recommend watching the whole show, maybe watch the first seasons and then skip to the last one, you won't really have a problem following the plot. Its funny tv series contains extreme knowledge of the physics. But sometimes it gives you headache because of the one character names sheldon who talks too much and gives too many arguments in the small things. Except that character its funny and understandable Great experience after a day of work/study, brings laughter and a fun time, short episodes so you can fit it in your schedule. I agree that the romance is a bit too much for a series known to be comedy It's one of those creations that give rise to immortal characters....... It's one of its kind.... it's beautiful, super hilarious..... It will make you smile throughout when it's on and you might not even realise that you've been continuously smiling throughout.....!!!!!! This was a very beautiful version of friends. N ending it is petty. I will truely miss them n comedy n smile this series bring on my face. After unravelling 12 years of mystery the show finally ends with a love letter to all the fans. It left me emotional & happy!
This is how a show should end!
A masterpiece & only show that came close to Friends!
Sheldon, Amy, Penny, Leonard, Howard, Raj & Bernie Thank you so much for being a part of my life for years. I just watched the final few episodes of "The Big Bang Theory."<br/><br/>It's never easy for any show to end in a way that is at once entertaining, not patronizing and resolute, but "The Big Bang Theory" did exactly that. Across 12 seasons and 279 episodes, "Big Bang" never felt too much and, at the end, it didn't feel too little.<br/><br/>With regards to TV comedies, I don't know that any other series has accomplished being consistently funny, charming and, at times, poignant while also concluding with such a wonderfully developed final season and series finale. In the tumultuous medium of television and in an age where every genre and micro-genre of entertainment is available at your audience's fingertips, that is truly a remarkable feat.<br/><br/>To the creators and crew of the show, congratulations on writing, building, and molding a series that no doubt exceeded in fulfilling the original vision.<br/><br/>To the cast, my heartfelt gratitude for your dedication and passion, and for breathing the life into these characters that simultaneously stayed true to who they were from their first lines, yet grew every step of the way. Perhaps Sheldon's wonderfully composed, honest, introspective, beautiful final speech articulated this better than I could have hoped to myself. These final words that both illuminated his greatest recognition professionally and, more importantly, expressed Sheldon's most exceptional achievement... his growth as a human being. I can think of no other way I would have wanted this series to say farewell.<br/><br/>So, from the bottom of my heart, I offer a sincere thank you to you... "The Big Bang Theory." The geek themed sitcom may not be original idea but it feels like one in executive hands of Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady. Comedy about four science guys and one cute girl pays a great deal of homage to "math" culture in the most warm and friendly way you can relate to, even if you are not the type who read comics, play Dungeons and Dragons or watch Star Trek. The respect and passion for science is another unique scent that permeates all seasons distinguishing the Big Bang Theory from countless sitcoms where every second joke is about sex or dating. Sadly, the show does not remain consistent with it direction switching completely to 'Friends' moods at the season 7 or so. The change from total geekness to the slices of life about relationships marks the line, where for many people the show becomes boring and, unfortunately, I can't argue with that. Stll, the jokes will always be pristine and funny, maybe typical, but funny, fueled by the amazing characters of Howard Wolowitz and Sheldon Cooper. The latter one is especially memorable, with its quirks, manner and brilliant play by Jim Parsons.<br/><br/>It is 278 episodes but I am happy I watched them all. Good memories do not fade away easily. To be honest I'm a little sensitive about shows I love. but this show had the strongest ending ever. I didn't cry or felt depressed for a few weeks, it just made me feel happy as it always did.
I loved every little thing about this show. It was both relatable and with high values. I simply loved it, now I usually put a long comment explaining why something deserves a good or a bad rating but this time I'll leave it to the pros :)) After 12 years of watching this show, I still remember my first reaction to the pilot of unknown show, with no reviews or votes or imdb: "this could be it, this could replace 'Friends'!". And they did. Episode by episode they have grow bigger in my hearth, and now after watching the last episode (episode 23/24 actually) for the first time i have drop a tear because of end of great show. Never before, never for any other show. End was great, with the style, as all episodes in the show. They have always been funny and smart, and they have never go into total drama (like 'Friends' did...) because they are comedy from first till last minute.
If you a little geeky, like me, you will love the show. And if you are not, if you are like my mom, you will still love it, maybe not understanding all the jokes and references to WoW, ST and SW universe, but still you will love it. If you didn't watch it before, please watch it! Maybe you will need 3-4 episodes to get the grip, but for sure they are worth your time, and you will be rewarded with your own laughter... Great cast of talented people with great writing and phrases you will repeat on street.
Thank you all the casts, writers and directors, and Chuck Lorre ofc, for this 12 years. Watched every episode and The Big Bang has been amazing. I love the series finally and wish you all the best in your future endeavors. Love and best wishes to you all. The first seasons..... 10, the new ones...... a 5. It just gets worse every season. And why would you put laughing background when a situation isn't even funny? This show made my day. thanks to all filmmakers who made this in tv. you all are the best! This show is hilarious and there are alot of episodes i love and they are really funny. I love Sheldon in this show he makes me laugh. I also love penny when she makes the most funny faces. An old friend of mine told my brother about it and he told me so i started watching it. I don't really care for the new seasons cause they are not funny at all but just like the reruns of the episodes from the earlier seasons. The Big Bang Theory is my favorite show! Apparently only negative people write reviews...not sure what everybody it talking about because this show makes me laugh just as hard now as it did in the first seasons. It got so much better with the addition of Amy and Bernadette who mellowed out the male characters and made them feel more realistic and believable. The characters have developed so well throughout 12 seasons, the show is hilarious with a lot of scientific and nerd humor thrown in! (Heavy spoilers for seasons 1-10)
As the title suggests, seasons 1 to 5 were spectacular. Most characters were still young and looking for love in a childish way, while living their nerdy lives. Sheldon & Leonard's relationship with Penny is worth-mentioning - they were such good friends and Leonard even had a couple dates with Penny, which was really cute.<br/><br/>I've been binge-ing this show for a couple months now, all the way from season 1 through 11, although I've never lost interest, the show was very obviously going downhills from season 6 and forth. Reasons behind that I've noticed are the amount of drama and the characters-growth-in-maturity.
Elaborating the former, the amount of drama created by the writers is just too much. For instance, the birth of Halley was sweet at first, but then it turned out to be a drag to the show. Bernadette and Howard, taking on the parents' roles, although often mischievous, are much less humorous ever since the birth of their daughter, and the funny bits are usually forced by Raj and Stuart, who have also grown a lot in terms of maturity, and are, of course, less humorous also.<br/><br/>Given that, the latter should be rather obvious. Although Sheldon doesn't seem to have that big of a change, his friends unfortunately do. Maturing isn't bad on its own, but if you're going to make them less funny, then hell naw'. Let's take some in the Social Group as examples. Penny, in the first couple of seasons, was kind of like a post-college sl**ty girl who was messed around by reality. With a never-ending list of boyfriends, she eventually settled with Leonard, to whom she was married to. A season after the said event, she began to develop a mature and boring personality, which no longer includes the sarcastic and who-gives-a-**** traits of her past.
Amy, who has been a steady regular character for quite a while, used to be that isolated weirdo who had tried desperately to be part of the Social Group / the girls' group. Now that she's "officially" part of the said groups, she's lost that desperately funny trait of hers and also gradually becoming unfunny.<br/><br/>For some reason, this review has become more negative than I'd planned. Given that, I will not stop watching and caring for the Big Bang Theory since it's still one of my favorite shows. Despite it going downhill, which I hope is stopping soon, Big Bang Theory is still a wonderful sitcom to laugh at and watch, especially in times of stress.<br/><br/>Thank you for reading this essay-length review of mine, and have a very Sheldon day. I am in love with this series. such a hilarious person you are sheldon I can not begin to express how much I love this show. Just from the name alone, I knew that I could relate to this show. I have a higher than normal IQ, genius level to be exact, and most other shows, I just can't understand why people like them. The Big Bang Theory's comedy, sarcasm, and wittiness is so funny, not because of the actual content, but because I know that so many people, less smart than me, can not begin to understand what they mean. The characters are also hilarious. The relationship between Sheldon and Penny is so deep, yet so distant. The writers for this show really know how to set up a perfect world, that only intelligent people can understand. Unfortunately, lots of people do not find this show funny. I just can not understand why. The only possibility in my mind is that they are just too dumb to comprehend the scientific humor. This show is targeted, to an audience that doesn't normally enjoy TV. It's a show that is intelligent, but at the same time witty. It's a show that has such deep meaning and characters, you begin to want to live there yourself. This show is amazing, and if I could, I would give it higher. 10/10 As a woman of color and not raised in Western society, I find their racist humor very offensive. When the show started, I thought, fun show with witty humor and I liked the concept of it especially being in Grad school and also kinda nerdy myself. But some of the jokes are way over the top. I have a sense of humor and I appreciate a good laugh every now and then but their constant racist humor? Really? I don't get it. As much as people keep saying get over it, it's just a joke, it doesn't make it any less offensive. Other than that, the idea of a sitcom based around people who are not obsessed with fashion, being stick thin or pop culture is an A+ in my book. It's different, I like it. But they lost me with their third world and Asian jokes. Not cool! A show where shaming and manipulating women scientists (or not) about their body, menstrual cycle and dating life when they challenge the intellect of/ refuse the unwanted advances of their creepy male counterparts, is celebrated and passed on as humour. It is a trashy show which trivializes male sexual and social anxiety and normalizes misogyny and gender based violence as completely acceptable. In short, it is a repulsive show. I don't say that about many shows because with shows I hate, I can understand how people like it. But Big Bang Theory is pure awfulness. And I can break it down easily<br/><br/>Penny - She's a character who wants to become an actress. It's ironic because the actress who plays her is absolutely awful. She can play one emotion and that's idiotic. It's a good thing she can play idiotic because that's how her character is written<br/><br/>Amy - "I don't have any friends" In case you don't realize, that's a joke according to the Big Bang Theory. She'll go from being a pathetic loser who is too pathetic to get sympathy to a crazy stalker who is too crazy to get sympathy. Either way, I'm fed up hearing jokes about her dandruff<br/><br/>Bernadette - "Oh look at me I talk in a Mickey Mouse voice but I'm secretly evil" Well done writers, how long did it take you think of having a seemingly nice person turn out to be all full of hate? That's so original and clever. The only purpose she has in the show is to make one of the actually funny characters less funny<br/><br/>Raj - "I treat my dog like a baby and my actions will hint to the audience that I'm gay, because gays are funny" The writers have no clue what to do with Raj. At one point he'll be feeling up Howard or getting into a awkward conversation with Stuart, the next minute he'll be talking to his girlfriend. When he couldn't talk to girls, that was funny because it meant we got less of his constant whining and talking about how cute his dog is. I hope that dog dies just so Raj will cry himself to sleep at night<br/><br/>Sheldon - "I'm autistic" LAUGH AUDIENCE LAUGH! Because that's what the Big Bang Theory thinks is funny. Sheldon started off a normal guy slightly quirky and then he became autistic. "Look he's playing with model trains yet he's a genius, that's so funny!" It's not even that funny. They could have made it into a joke like with Bobby from Sopranos, but they just had it there. And the amount of crap that the characters get from Sheldon is too much. My dream ending to the show would be Leonard getting into his car and running Sheldon over. I never thought I'd say that about someone who is autistic, but Big Bang Theory is literally making me evil<br/><br/>Leonard - I don't even know how to describe Leonard except for the normal nerd and even saying that makes me hate the show slightly more<br/><br/>Howard - Yeah! I actually like Howard (I have to like somethings about this otherwise it would be 0/10). Howard is funny, he's just a ratty, perverted bachelo... oh wait, he's married Bernadette. Crap<br/><br/>Stuart - Stuart was the funniest guy and did a completely 180 and started hanging out with Howard's mum. It was funny for an episode, but then they thought "If something is funny for an episode, then it must be funny for a whole season!" And what do you know, now I wish Stuart burned to death in his shop<br/><br/>The Show - The best way to describe the show is "No way" as in No way would Penny (The apparent cool girl even though she really isn't) hang out with the two geeky girls No way would Leonard let Sheldon mentally abuse him for this long No way would Howard continue to be friends with Raj No way would Howard let Stuart come anywhere near his mum's house (No joking, if I was Howard, I would have beaten the crap out of Stuart by now) No way would people like this show so much that it gets a three year renewal<br/><br/>My rating? Dumb out of 10 Season 6 was really hard going.<br/><br/>The focus has drifted away from the characters being nerdy sci-fi fans to teenage boys with girl problems - although the "boys" are all either side of thirty.<br/><br/>Viewer wise it's been the most successful series in the USA so I suspect that next season will be more of the same.<br/><br/>If TBBT had started out in this vein I would never have watched it and now see no reason to continue to do so.<br/><br/>It was good while it lasted but season five started the rot and season six killed it. i love this programme unlike many comedies beamed in from America i actually find this intelligent and funny. This comedy revolves around 4 nerds and Leonard Sheldon Raj and Howard and a fit girl called Penny followed by Amy and Bernadette in later series. what i like about this show is that its intelligent i think and unlike 2 and a half men which i despise it does not Center round one subject. I have fell in love with all the characters mostly Sheldon because i don't think their has ever been a character like him on TV ever the closest thing would maybe be jj from skins just maybe. I hate most American comedies today this being the only exception. i just think this is the best American show on TV just nice to see a programme about the supposed outcasts of society and seeing them portrayed as likable human beings not so much sheldon but their is much debate among fans that he is autistic or not. Brilliant TV show and the only TV show i actually enjoy watching with my brothers Hated it from the first episode<br/><br/>Hated it from the next one my ex-made me sit through<br/><br/>Hated the third friends watched while I was at their house.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This is the hill comedy goes to curl up and die on, while a laugh track kicks the body until it's cold.<br/><br/>
Chuck Lorre is brain cancer. This show has developed a social clichÃ© and is very popular among comedy lovers.The show started with four nerds and a beautiful blonde,where two of the nerds played support. But as the show went on Sheldon grew as the lead guy of the show. Lenard and Penny with their love story played the second fiddle. The first 3 seasons of the show were pretty good,with Lenard developing from a shy/introvert to a WOMANIZER,having multitude of relationships and affairs.But in the events, Howard was the real show stopper with his witty one-liners and desperate attempt to indulge in any kind of possible coitus. Raj played the laid back support well and the duo was really funny. BUT then the writers of the show thought otherwise and started dedicating episodes to Sheldon, which made the show go lame,with his same repetitive silly jokes,tantrums,nagging and asexuality. The character of Sheldon had huge prospect,as a guy with no emotions and childish psychology but the writers made it something else as if he needed all the exposure. All this and added the relationships and love affairs,with the addition of Bernadette and Amy it was the last nail in the coffin. Bernadette is a pathetic actress,with her nasal and tongue twisted accent makes it hard to keep watching the show. Amy is a desperate girl who acts very mechanical at times,she could have been easily replaced by a better actress. Now with the Season 8 concluding most of the episodes have become very soap opera with women and men socializing,rather than creating situation like earlier in the show. It is also difficult for the writers to come up with script for around 24 episodes a season,thus it is filled with crap and filler materials.With relationships and Sheldon's tantrums taking precedence there are times when even Rajesh Kootrapalli looks better to watch and enjoyable.Many a times it gives a feeling why I'm still watching the show!<br/><br/>This show is still gonna run, given the huge fan following it has,no matter how much the quality of the show depreciates. It stupefies me that people find this amusing. Perhaps these fans are the same people who emerged from school--even college--with no serious interest in anything at all, and no ability to discuss anything useful, but who--should last night's football game be broached--can analyze it with such ferocity that, had they similarly attacked their careers, they would have retired with one quadrillion dollars at age twenty-three. I have yet to perceive that any of the show's characters is a genius. Oh, but they certainly are nerds--of course! Everyone whose IQ is three points above Joe Average Dullard must be a nerd, a loser, ugly, and--of course--a virgin until age fifty. Whether it's "Malcolm in the Middle" or "Saved by the Bell" or, in fact, "The Big Bang Theory," the vulgarized depiction of intelligent people as an object of scorn and mockery simply disgusts one. End of statement. The talented writers and actors that make this show work are the best in the business. They clearly specialize in CHEMISTRY because the chemistry of this show is first-rate! Not only are the top-billed stars outstanding, but so many of the guest stars are fantastic as well! I seriously cannot think of any episode that is not rip-roaring hilarious.<br/><br/>CBS ... please, Please, PLEASE, ***PLEASE*** keep this show going on for many more years! Make it break all records for productivity and longevity.<br/><br/>There have been many great comedies in the past (Seinfeld, The Lucy Show, Married with Children, etc.) but none of them can touch The Big Bang Theory for sheer all-around delight. Well done! As a person who grew up playing D&D, excelling in science at school, and being picked on unmercifully just for being intelligent enough to stand out from the herd, I fell in love with the Big Bang Theory the first time I saw it. It was already in the second season, so I immediately went to the store and bought the first season DVD to get caught up.<br/><br/>This show, at least the first three seasons, is one of the few on television that I can truly call "intelligent," so much so that, if I were not as well-read in the sciences, especially physics, I would not get half of the jokes. Perhaps that's why, as I feared, it was soon "dumbed down" for the masses, becoming a "who's doing who?" sex- and stupidity-driven shell of what was once the perfect sitcom for people who are proud to be called "nerds." I cannot help but notice that the show began to become disappointing at about the same time as Mayim Bialik's character, Amy Farrah Fowler, was introduced, although it is certainly not Bialik's fault- her acting is great and she has turned Amy Farrah Fowler into one of the best characters on the show, now that she has lost the creepiness and gained more nerdiness. Simon Helberg's Howard Wolowitz was already the creepy, sex-obsessed, nerdy Jew- we didn't need another one. Fortunately, Wolowitz has grown and matured over the course of the series; a very good thing, as I was growing tired of his stereotypical character. I have honestly never liked Leonard Hofstader, who is played very well by Johnny Galecki. Leonard is and has been from the pilot, a whiny, selfish little man-child who will immediately stab his friends in the back on the odd chance that he might get to "hook up" with a pretty girl.<br/><br/>Rajesh Koothrappali, played by Kunal Nayyar, was great as a guy so afraid of women that he couldn't speak around them, and worked well when he discovered that alcohol solved the problem, but that little plot device has turned around and become an inconvenience, as now Raj is forced to be constantly drinking in order to have any dialog around female characters. His somewhat effeminate ways were cute at first, but have grown to ridiculous proportions, the only reason that I can see being that modern Hollywood feels the need to have a "gay", or very metro at least, character in every stinking show. They should have kept Raj and Wolowitz as an "odd couple" kind of duo and explored their friendship more, and cut Bernadette altogether, or at least drastically.<br/><br/>Speaking of Bernadette Rostenkowski, played by the lovely Melissa Rauch. She should have remained a minor character. Her character does not fit with the show at all, and has become nothing more than an on-screen Mrs. Wolowitz, as in the personification of Howard's mother. This is probably deliberate and might have worked somehow, but it's just not working. As a nerdy friend of Penny's who helps Penny understand the differences between "the guys" and "normal people," she works great, though. Let's focus more on that and have a genuine friendship develop between her and Penny.<br/><br/>And Penny, the last-nameless pretty blonde across the hall. Now I could be biased, because though I am older, I'm still a man, and let's face it, Kaley Cuoco is absolutely stunning. But I have always liked her character. Typical Midwest farmer's daughter who goes to California to become a star. OK, seen that before, but she plays the part very well. And I am so glad to see that she has gone from being just the "dumb blonde" to a more refined character with some depth and a very down-to-earth wisdom that often shows her ability to grasp difficult concepts much more readily than the super-genius Leonard and Sheldon. And her scenes with Sheldon are some of the most brilliant of the series.<br/><br/>Finally, my favorite character (many people's fave), Dr. Sheldon Cooper, played to perfection by Jim Parsons. I am most disappointed with Sheldon Cooper. Whereas the point was originally that Sheldon is so smart and so socially inept that he honestly does not realize the consequences of his actions, making him an insufferable little douche, but in a funny, cute way, the show has decided to completely change him into an "evil genius" stereotype, who actually enjoys causing pain or insult. That IS NOT SHELDON COOPER, and I do hope the show's creators stop this nonsense in its tracks, or it will DESTROY THE SHOW. I give as an example a recent episode where Sheldon deliberately and gleefully spoils the ending of a Harry Potter book for Leonard, not once, but twice, out of what seems to be pure malevolence. Sorry, but you have betrayed the audience in choosing to go that route, guys. Sheldon was funny because he was unintentionally disruptive, but now he has started to become intentionally "bad", and it's ruining the show. Maybe it was the whole "Shamy" thing that started the descent, who knows. And I swear, if Sheldon EVER has sex, even with Amy, I will stop watching the show. Period.<br/><br/>But despite all that, still far and away the best sitcom on TV lately, and the only one I have obsessed over watching every single episode of, since Star Trek: The Next Generation and Married... With Children before it. As such it gets an 8/10, with hopes that the producers will stop listening too much to fans on the internet (never a great idea and always best taken with a huge grain of salt), bring back the "smart" jokes, whether anyone gets them or not, and this show will keep going strong for some time, rather than struggling to limp through another season, as I am seeing now. First things first, Sheldon. *Standing Ovation*<br/><br/>It is simply AMAZING how Jim Parson plays Sheldon Cooper. The short and sharp comments. The whimsical personality of a genius. Packed with social shortcomings. He is simply PERFECT.<br/><br/>This show is a delight. It helps me exercise my brain enjoying every minute of it.<br/><br/>Penny, you are awesome too. It is simply a beauty how the script unfolds.<br/><br/>Every episode is simply crammed with humor and frankly it is smart humor. After exploiting the social inadequacies of a genius for humor, now this soap has taken to the likes of How I met your Mother or maybe even friends.<br/><br/>Yet, every time I see Sheldon, it makes me laugh.<br/><br/>The plot is nice. The cast is perfect and the humor is good.<br/><br/>WATCH it! Quite possibly the funniest show since Seinfeld. There is so much going-on in any given episode, that the episodes bear repeat viewings. Just like Seinfeld. Four rocket scientists are best friends, in an odd sort f way, and all work at Cal Tech, Their lives are forever changed with the arrival of a trashy but pretty waitress who takes the apartment across the hall from where two of the guys live. So much goes on in each episode, it is impossible to explain. The star of the show is clearly the rubber-limbed Texas-born actor who plays Sheldon, the geekiest of the bunch. The guy is a major find, and will have along career ahead of him when the show finally runs out of gas, which it is doing as I write this. After all, the show has been on the air for seven seasons. If I had one episode I could direct you to, it would be when the boys dress up as members of the JLA for a costume contest at their local comic book store. From this hilarious episode came the most-quoted catch phrase of the series: "Aquaman sucks!" The show is addictive. Its only drawback: a canned laugh track. I watched the Big Bang theory essentially because of its high score on IMDb, although since I give it a 6, it shows that I find this TVs show overrated, and definitely not as funny as the other comedy TV shows out there that have also such a high score. But what makes this TV show also not so great is the laugh tracks. It's way worse than in the 80s/90s, plus even if the production proved that it was not a laughing machine, it doesn't change anything. There are literally loud laughs after every sentence even when it's just an ordinary and trivial sentence! It's distracting and annoying. And it's loud, plus we do know when to laugh, we don't need to hear more laughs than actual jokes. I actually realized that many fans are also annoyed by that, can't blame them. Otherwise, it's entertaining! The Big Bang theory is very amusing for several reasons. First, there are hardly any mistakes ever made throughout the series. Second, the jokes( which are hysterical) vary on subject and so, never get stale. Third, I think the outfits chosen for each character fit their personality like a glove. Fourth,by watching, you will lean new words, physicists, inventions, discoveries, etc. In conclusion, I fully enjoy and recommend this program.<br/><br/>WARNING:A COUPLE SPOILERS IN PARAGRAPH BELOW. Some of my favorite jokes: ~When Sheldon's sister visits and the gang( besides Sheldon) want to date her and Sheldon refuses permission, Howard asks him if the reason he can't is because hes Jewish and says "Because I'll kill my Rabbi with a pork chop if I have to". Sheldon dismisses this quickly. Since this joke was not meant to be serious, I found it to be a good laugh.<br/><br/>~ In the episode when Leonard tells Penny the story of the first time he met Sheldon, several jokes are made such as: Sheldon's previous roommate wrote "Die Sheldon Die!" in bold red spray paint on the wall indicating he went crazy; Leonard is shown with a puffy, curly afro; a transvestite(who called Sheldon "the crazy guy next door", lived across the hall from his apartment; and it tells you just how the elevator was broken( Leonard had made a mistake when making a top secret fuel, which Sheldon tossed into the elevator, and it exploded.<br/><br/>~Sheldon struggles to understand and indicate when someone is using sarcasm. Also, when he attempts to use sarcasm, his tone does not change at all.<br/><br/>~When Sheldon breaks up with Amy, he copes with this by buying dozens of cats with names such as Sir Isaac Newton and Zazzles. Is it any wonder why I love this show? Since I'm already a nerd, I definitely feel a small connection to the characters. And overall, this show is just funny.<br/><br/>The plot follows the typical nerd story: nerd falls in love with hot girl and tries to get her to like him back. The only thing missing is a big dumb jock to act as an archenemy to our nerdy hero. There actually is a big jock, but he only appears in a few episodes. Eh, well, the show's still good without him. The other thing I love is all the pop culture references. Star Trek, Star Wars, comic books, superheroes, Halo, Lord of the Rings, Firefly, this show knows how to poke fun at our fanboy obsessions.<br/><br/>The characters are great. Leonard (Johnny Galecki) is the star and the everyman of the group, trying to maintain control between the real world and the nerd world. Penny (Kaley Cuoco) is the hot girl across the hall and Leonard's primary love interest. She's a lovable character and you have to admire her for making friends with four guys she has absolutely nothing in common with. Howard and Raj (Simon Helberg and Kunal Nuyyar) don't have a lot of character development, but are there as the lovable sidekicks of the show. But the character that really steals the spotlight is Sheldon (Jim Parsons). I don't really know what to make of Sheldon. He's one of those characters you just love to hate. He's a theoretical physicist, neat freak, a perfectionist and an egomaniac. Imagine Mr. Monk with a 187 IQ and an ego. Sheldon doesn't understand sarcasm, doesn't know when it's rude to ask something, always has to have his way with something, and always assumes he's right, which means he's constantly getting in trouble with the other characters. Whether he's obnoxious on purpose or seriously means well but at the wrong time, I guess that's up to the audience to decide. Still, Sheldon's a funny character and it's always fun to watch him get into trouble.<br/><br/>But there is one downside. While the show may look like a family-friendly series, there is a hefty amount of crude and adult humor, (usually from Sheldon asking an inappropriate question, or Howard being his usual horny self) so make sure the kids are in bed before you tune in.<br/><br/>But overall, the is a really good show. So release your inner nerd and tune in. Please people, indulge yourself more into watching this show, before you make conclusion it is a stereotype. I usually hear Penny's character is dumb blond and others are unrealistic... I have to Admit I really liked this show since I saw myself in penny, I never understood science, I went to high school oriented towards languages and literature. And somehow my friends where always boys who understood everything about science, computers and engineering. They always talked like as they say ,,nerds'' in this show, and I even had friend who was asexual like Sheldon, and it was hard to understand him but everyone loved him. at the End I even got married to a men who is actually into all three things ( science, computers, engineering. and sometimes I have difficulties to understand what is he talking about, or I don't understand at all, but we are full of compassion at the end of the day:D Oh dear this is not film review this is my life review... Actually I wrote this in order to tell you that these characters are not shallow, they are deep, they have many sides and have difficulties no matter how intelligent they are... You just have to love these guys:) I absolutely adore this show because I think its really different from anything else on television right now. I also love the above-anyone's-intelligence jokes which are quite obvious, however there is a lot of subtle humor as well.<br/><br/>Sheldon and Leonard, who are roommates, are hysterical together, to say nothing of Raj and Howard. All four of the friends seem to simply 'get' each other. Despite the fact that they are all extremely huge nerds, they are nerds in different ways.<br/><br/>Raj cannot talk to girls. At all. But he wants a girlfriend.<br/><br/>Howard well, is horny. But his people skills are a huge fail which is why he's still single. And still horny.<br/><br/>Leonard is by far the most normal but he's still a nerd too. He's obviously infatuated with Penny, the young woman who lives across the hall. I won't give anything away about their relationship but its adorable and hilarious.<br/><br/>Sheldon has Asberger's syndrome and well, he thinks very highly of himself. He doesn't seem to realize he has issues though they are plenty and in abundance.<br/><br/>Penny is cute, fun, and tries to show these boys that there is life beyond Star Trek. She's a deep character though and I was very glad to see that she isn't portrayed as the stereotypical blonde.<br/><br/>Despite my love for this show, I know it won't last. First off, why in God's name is there a laugh track? The audience isn't as stupid as Chuck Lorre seems to think. We get the humor. Take out the laugh track.<br/><br/>I also don't think the plot can last. How I Met Your Mother has a goal to meet and they can keep pushing it. I don't know where The Big Bang Theory will go but I hope it stays for a while.<br/><br/>All in all, don't ride this show off as nerdy or lame. It is both but you will laugh at it. Everyone can find something to laugh at during this show. So give it a chance :) Sheldon opens door: Laugh track
Sheldon closes door: Even louder laugh track.<br/><br/>just. don't. bother.
Go watch Friends. its a better show in every way.<br/><br/>Dont u dare down vote this u smelly fools. As an engineer, the line that drew me to this show was the "Engineers - the Oompa Loompas of Science" by the character of Sheldon Cooper. Since then, PVRing and watching the reruns has become an integral part of my TV viewing habits. The writers are not ashamed about praising the bright, clever and nerds and showing a contempt towards the ordinary, mundane and kitsch.<br/><br/>My exposure to American television has been limited to sitcoms - Simpsons, South Park, Family Guy, Seinfeld, Frasier, Cheers. Most of these shows have maintained their quality for first 8-9 season before they lose their freshness, charm and intelligence. Sadly, for TBBT, the decline has started right in the fourth season. From a clever and intelligent comedy show, it has just turned into a comedy show - resting on past laurels. People still laugh just because the show used to be funny.<br/><br/>The physics jokes and references are long gone. The writers now resort to gags, fart jokes and gay/lesbian entendres to forcibly invoke humour. The characters are still physicists, but they hardly seem to discuss any kind of sciences these days. Addition of extraneous characters (Bernadette's parents, for example), just adds to the tedium and frustration. However, the major decline has come in the formation of the character of Sheldon Cooper - from a stoic physicists to a buffoon. The dialogue and character writers initially set the standards so high, that they are now finding impossible to reach those standards season after season. They have turned Sheldon Cooper into a modern day "Kramer" - invoking laughter just by gags. While Kramer gags worked because of a solid dialogues, TBBT writers have nothing to back up for Sheldon's antics.<br/><br/>Just like Simpsons, the show still subsists because there seem to be enough viewers to maintain the ratings. It seems that the creators of this show are still intoxicated with the show's success. But lovers of intelligent comedy will soon wash their hands of this show, I assume. We should all agree: the five main characters may all be different but yet they form a perfect crew for this geeky and humorous TV show. At first, I was not attracted to watching it but then when I started, I found that it was very addictive. Not only have the characters been able to play their role to perfection but the dialogues are well documented. They do not talk nonsense and yet you think they do since we are not all physicists and you still manage to laugh when you finally get it. The actors must have practised hard to be able to have the perfect facial expression as required by the different episodes: they had to show disgust, happiness, incomprehension (Penny most of the time), envy, anger to name just a few. Light and ideal for the moment when you get back home tired and need a good laugh, The Big Bang Theory fits any time. And if you really appreciate it, then you grow attached to each character. You see the change that occurs through time. The good thing about this show is that the story does not lag: what has to happen happens quickly or at least, the story is not lenghthened with exagerration unlike some other TV shows where the climax lasts an eternity. I give it 8 out of 10 simply because all TV shows have their negative aspects. Here, what cost it 2 out of 10 is sometimes you get unnerved by the continuous sheepishness of the characters. Sometimes, you tell yourself: OK Sheldon; stop that now, we all got it, just stop. Now this happens rarely but it does happen and cannot be neglected. On the overall, two thumbs up. Okay, for first start of my review, let's introduce the characters. Leo, Sheldon, Howard and Raj are the world's biggest nerds! They are extremely intelligent! Leo is kind of the most normal dude in this show! All of the others are, hum... Have social difficulties, I suppose you could say! Sheldon has compulsives obsessions, Howard thinks he is a "Casanova", and Raj is very shy with girls! He can't even talk to a girl! So, all those characters are best friends , and all of them have different personalities, and it makes make the show so awesome! Funny has hell, great performances from all the cast (and Penny, she is ridiculously hot)! Anyway, if you are a geek or a nerd you will love this show (just like myself). You'll enjoy every episodes of this series! It is really original and unique! So, check it out! You won't regret it!<br/><br/>9 out of 10! (because perfection doesn't exist!) I don't know why people saying the later seasons weren't good, in the beginning they are just geeks, they can't be geeks forever...show ran for 12 seasons, there had to be character development. The Big Bang Theory was recommended to me by my friends, and after it's last season ended, i chose to give it a go. and i can definitely say that this show gets on your nerves, its that annoying.
The shows characters are unbearable with the exception of Sheldon, Amy and Howard. these characters we see them grow with time and develop, and their acting is good and, jokes from these characters make you smile from time to time.
Now come the worst of the characters, i.e Leonard, Penny and Bernadette. These Characters dont grow at all, plus they are horrendous actors with jokes that are so forced, that if there isnt the background laughter, you'd vomit over them. they are that bad. These characters grow annoying.
The show tries to be inspired by friends, two sets that serve as apartments, that are facing each other. an eatery where they hangout. penny being a waitress who grows to a successful lady.
The show has no originality to it. The nerd culture is shown as if the nerds are dumb, lifeless creatures who have no life, and are always reading comics 'cliche' and talking of science and playing video games. like woah! lol, and the stupidity of the whole show is the only thing that is hilarious. Most of the humor from this show comes from references people don't get. But when you do get them they're not very funny. Also the drama and story aren't very good as well. I love watching this show. I've found another show that I can watch over and over again. It makes me laugh out loud. I truly believe that the Big Bang Theory is the worst sitcom I have ever seen and there are three reasons for this. Reason one, The portshion quality The Big Bang Theory's portshion quality is extremely dated and was being to become dated when it was first aired in 2007. This TV show still has a laths track and use three chamras and almost never films in locations. It's always sunny in philadelphia was made two years before the Big Bang Theory in 2005 and did not have a lath track and used only one camera. Even The Big Bang Theory's spin off show young sheldon has no laugh track and uses only one camera. 
Reason two, The characters, arguably the most important part about any sitcom is the characters, The Big Bang Theory has some of the worst characters ever written into any media. I hate each and every individual character in The Big Bang Theory. Let's start with the main character of this series and that is Sheldon Cooper. The hole joke to his character is that he is autistic. every single one of Sheldon Cooper's characteristics as a characteristic related to autism. Characteristic such as poor social abilities, failure to understand sarcasm and unintentionally annoying friends. That might sound like am just nik-picking but it is extremely obvious when watching this TV show. Then there is Leonard Hofstadter who is played by Johnny Galecki, the joke to his character is that he is a nerd that is dating a hot blond chick. And who is the hot blond chick? Will her name is Penny and is played by Kaley Cuoco and she is the only character not to have a last name. Penny's entire character is that she is a stupid hot chick. Then there is Howard Wolowitz who is played by Simon Helberg. He is a much better character Because he is jewish. He also makes a lot of racist jokes especially to Raj Koothrappali who is played by Kunal Nayyar his entire character is that he is indien and in the earlier season he was unable to talk to woman but that plot point goes away by season three. Now there is a lot more character but I think that I have made my point. All characters in The Big Bang Theory are just stereotypes. This is not enough to make ten season out of. There character never go above just beginning stereotypes.
Reason two, the comedy. This show uses two types of comedy being Racist and bathos. This is one of the most offence TV shows I have ever seen. There are ways to do comedy right. In the Big Bang Theory whenever a racist joke is told the character just takes it and the joke ends there making the person who is being told the joke the . But if we were to do a racist joke right we would not have the joke end there, the funniest part about the joke would be the reaction to the joke. Let say a white person makes a racist joke to a black person. If the black person does respond and we see that he is offended by the joke it makes the joke seen as if it is unacceptable to say. The show writer acknowledge that this is a racist joke and the joke transform form being a racist joke and into satire. But The Big Bang Theory never has it character react to the joke making the show look racist and most importantly unfunny. The second type of humor is bathos or as I like to call it the jump scare of comedy. So what is a bathos, a Bathos is when there seems to be a serious scene but, sundly out of the blue there is a joke. The Big Bang Theory constantly uses bathos. A bathos is the most lazy form of comedy.
The Big Bang Theory is just terablo I do not understand how for ten season they got away with such lazily written characters a humor. The Big Bang Theory shows the worst in american sitcoms and I think that it only have one or two more season to go before people just get sick of this show.
That's Why I give the Big Bang Theory a 2 out of 10 I tried to like "The Big Bang Theory". I really tried. However, after seeing a couple of episodes from this sitcom, I ended hating everything about it. that was one of the worst things ever and not just on TV. This series is an insult to the mind of the audience. Please make a good comedy serial. Use this review to make progress. Dear writers, you make the content. you must be Pay attention. It's obvious that the creators were basing the character of Sheldon Cooper off of Nikola Tesla. His quirks of having an Eidetic memory, not having sexual relations, and more are modeled off of Tesla. However, compared to Tesla, Cooper is not nearly as bright. His contributions are nonexistent; whereas, a world without Tesla is a world I would not want to live in. Without Tesla, AC/DC may not even exist. If they do exist their name wouldn't be nearly as cool. In this reality they probably wouldn't even do the soundtrack of Stephen King's Maximum Overdrive!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Long story short, the show serves as a great injustice to one of the world's greatest men. I consider myself a bit of connoisseur of comedy. I like to dissect jokes and situations to really find what makes them funny. That being said, I find very little material in this show that even remotely resembles comedy. 75% of the jokes seem to be the same set up, followed by the same payoff, just using different words. Formula: 1:"Intelligent observation" 2:"Intelligent Banter" 3:"Relate a comic book\Sci-Fi show or movie" 4:"Que Laughter" Occasionally throw in some "Look at how incredibly socially awkward they are" moments and that's about it. There is a reason why hyper intelligent and nerdy people are socially awkward and excluded. It's because most people don't want to listen to a 20 minute debate about the intricacies of superheroes plausible physical capabilities put into a real world context. Admittedly I've only watched like 6 or 7 episodes, but from what I can tell there is absolutely zero character development or variation, although that is on par for most sitcoms (usually a very low form of comedy anyway). Overall I'd say that the writers manage to produce one or two actually intellectual and funny jokes per episode. I honestly can not believe how popular this show is. Something something bazinga something. Totally trash. Uuuuuuuggggghhh. I don't get it. Some people obviously think it's really good. I can only surmise that they must be victims of some kind of brain injury and are just mesmerized by the colours.<br/><br/>Here's a synopsis of every single episode:<br/><br/>Girl walks into apartment
"Hi guys!'<br/><br/>30 seconds of laugh track.<br/><br/>Nerd guy 1: "Star Wars!"
2 mins of laugh track.<br/><br/>Nerd guy 2: "Video games!"
12 minutes of laugh track.<br/><br/>Nerd guy 3: "You can tell we're nerds because we wear dumb t-shirts and have stupid haircuts and constantly reference retro geek culture without context and for no reason.
7 minutes of laugh track.<br/><br/>Girl: "Wow, I guess you guys really are nerds"
30 seconds of laugh track.<br/><br/>Roll credits.<br/><br/>This is literally the entire show. If you watch and enjoy this show it might be time to start seriously considering self harm. How this crap show lasted for 12 years is a mind rape just thinking about it.<br/><br/>First of all the Big Bang Theory is not a funny show. Its Hash.<br/><br/>The only times I had to see this disgrace of a show was when I had to walk past the TV in the family room while its playing. In just short seconds I instantly felt that this show is awful. When you eat with this show on you feel like puking.<br/><br/>Every time I saw it all they did was try lame jokes after joke after joke after joke and they were not funny.<br/><br/>The tall geek says something = laugh track.
The Indian geek says hi = laugh track. This is how pathetic TBBT is.<br/><br/>(Oh yeah!) A Geek see's a girl = laugh track.<br/><br/>The Geeks on this show were no where near Steve Urkels level. Family Matters sucked but Urkel was still a legendary character.<br/><br/>This show was made for dumb people.<br/><br/>Even The MCU is more of a comedy with its whack jokes than the Big Bang Theory ever was.<br/><br/>Its just sad that this show that I never watched could mind rape me for 12 years.<br/><br/>The producers of TBBT most get high off pushing the laugh track button. This has to be the most ridiculously boring, cheesy show, I have ever seen. Not funny, though it's considered a comedy somehow. Just an all-out horrible series. What anybody sees in this series, is beyond me. Sure it was a hit whenever whenever, how though, I have no clue, but for me and countless others I'm sure, it's nothing even close to a hit, nor funny. WASTED TIME I saw the first episode and never looked back; except for all of the reruns that I continue to watch on several channels. This show never gets old; even in the reruns you can see something you missed before. For example the signs in the laundry room... read them... Recently I downloaded the theme song from iTunes and was rolling on the floor when I listened to the second verse... listen to it... However, I swear that the Bare Naked Ladies say "million" instead of "billion" in the beginning. If you've never seen this show, you are truly missing one of the best TV shows of all time! Granted it's not at the level of M.A.S.H. yet, but it hasn't run for 11 seasons yet either. This is definitely a must watch show... watch it... I happened to catch some episodes thanks to my girlfriend and I found it extremely funny. And here I was thinking that all the good sitcom shows had ended with the demise of Fraiser. This one kind of reminds me of that show and that is probably why I enjoy it so much. It revolves around friends and not a family which I also like. No kids to grow old and cause the show to become bad where they have to add another child to keep the show going. This one has two roommates who live across the hall from an attractive blond. Leonard and Sheldon are the main characters and the roommates. Penny is the attractive roommate. There are also a couple of other friends the two guys know from work. Suffice to say the four guys are like super smart geniuses which is why I like the show. The humor revolves around these guys being huge nerds, though Sheldon is my favorite. That guy is super smart, but so socially awkward he makes the show for me. The others are funny too, but Sheldon is the reason I keep watching. I wonder what kind of thing he is going to do or say next, I also like the strange friendship he has with Penny. Leonard is good too in that he has to put up with Sheldon's very strange at times behavior. Just an all around funny show and it is nice there are still funny sitcoms on television. I wasn't very enthusiastic about the Big Bang Theory when my sister first shared the synopsis and invited me to join in watching. Two episodes through, though, I couldn't stop laughing. What I absolutely love about this show is that it is not your usual stereotype. You don't laugh "at" people; you laugh with people. Leonard, Sheldon, Penny, Howard and Raj are all believable characters that you love the more you get to know them. And if you've ever been called a nerd, then you'll definitely be able to relate to one or more of them to some degree. The humor in the show is smart; it respects people's intelligence instead of assuming that viewers can only laugh at the dumb and the obvious. Plus, you learn something new every episode! Big Bang Theory has probably been responsible for increased Google searches for things like "SchrÃ¶dinger's cat", "String Theory" and "Flatland". I have watched this show from the beginning but I cannot tolerate Hollywood abusing the platform for expressing political opinions! I give up and will not watch further. I have many good books to read so I don't need you Chuck Lorre! The gratuitous 'audience laughs' need to be SEVERELY reduced. There's barely 5 seconds without a 'laugh', even for bits that aren't that funny. It's made an otherwise decent show almost unbearable for me, and I don't usually notice these things.<br/><br/>Love the geekiness though, it's basically the Americans doing a version of The I.T. Crowd. Although the humour is a lot less subtle and clever, but I guess that's the American way, and it works alright. It does feel like they're being so obvious with their quips and puns that they consider all the viewers to be under 10 though.<br/><br/>Overall pretty disappointed, not nearly as well done as it could have been. But I'm sure it will appeal to their apparent 10-year-old target audience. This show is, unintentionally, a perfect representation of what's wrong with the USA. Let's set up a great asexual character who was great representation, and then let's make him ""realize"" how that's just weird and wrong over nine more seasons. Let's explore a romance that gives us the right to portray blondes as stupid for twelve seasons. Let's add a character who steers remote-controlled cars with cameras between women's legs and does other stuff that would get him jailed in the real world, and portray it as funny. Let's add an Indian character, so we can pull off one stereotype about South Asians after the other. In twelve years of their lives, one character meets one non-cishet character one single time, and that's it. In twelve years. And they're in California. Let's hardly have any black characters ever. Let's shame male characters hardcore whenever they show the slightest feminine trait. This show is sexist, aphobic, racist, transphobic, and a lot more.<br/><br/>And, oh boy, that's far from the only problem. After about six seasons, the show has absolutely no steam left. After all the characters became average society-conforming boredom pills, the show, for some reason, carried on for six more years! Six more years, after all the conflicts were resolved! They didn't just milk that cow until it gave no more milk, they milked it until it had no more blood, fell over, and died.<br/><br/>At least in the first three seasons, there were a few jokes that landed well. Season 3 was actually fine. But then, the show had to introduce horrendous characters like Amy, who, at first, is just an overclocked version of Sheldon, who is more obnoxious than really any character ever. Then, for some reason, she suddenly loves sex, and wants Sheldon to love and screw her so bad. What in the world has made her take that 180 degree turn? And also Bernadette... Not only yet another instance of the "blondes are stupid" stereotype, but it is baffling to me that she and Howard get married in the end. They have absolutely nothing in common, except that they're annoyed by their mothers. And I just laughed at the incompetence of the show when their baby was born, which sounds nothing like a baby, and is always off-screen, because the crew can't even get a baby on set. It's pathetic.<br/><br/>At least two good things came out of this show for me. It made me curious to see Star Wars, which made me discover my passion for film. And it also improved my English skills a lot, especially daily conversational English. To save you the time, watch Star Wars. Don't waste your time watching this, like I did. This show is a monstrosity. It is so robotic and just isn't entertaining. Every word sounds like they put sheldons voice on google, typed in the words they wanted and then pressed audio. They never gave this show a chance. With a bad script and bad sets too even, the actors did the best with what they had but... This is a show about nerds and geeks about people who have no idea about nerds and geeks. This is also a show about hot blonde girls and intelligent girls written by people who have no idea about hot blonde girls or intelligent girls. There's a laugh track, which I can tolerate. Done well, like in Friends and Coupling, it can add to the humour. But here, it's just played as if on autocue after every bit of inane, mundane, utterly humourless dialogue as if that somehow magically makes it all funny. Jim Parsons got the role of a lifetime and I appreciate his work. Nothing more. A collection of stereotypes who don't go anywhere at all. Some former colleagues of mine used to rave about this when I was at grad school (c.2007 - 2011). Full disclosure - they are (and I am) a scientist - not that rariified species 'a physicist', but close enough to get the v.occasionally oblique references to publications, grants, etc.<br/><br/>So, here I am on another Netflix binge, in an attempt to catch up on the last decade (at Series 5, Ep 12 at the time of writing). I can imagine this was a difficult series to write - how do you make the geeky, scientific world view of a group of nerds who don't get out (too) much funny.? Well, as others have alluded to here, you ramp up their geekyness (e.g. role-playing games, exhibits of their general knowledge prowess and forary's into their work), hone in on their insecurities and weirdness (e.g. Raj's inability to speak to women and Sheldon's room mate agreement) and then add in the love interests to highlight the disparity between their and others 'normal'.<br/><br/>I enjoy this for all the reasons above and the window it provides on the occasional pre-occupations of some scientists. Definitely worth watching! This is best and funniest tv show i have ever seen I think the concept is new and refreshing compared to the Friends copied Seinfeld, or Seinfeld copied Friends quarrels. This is innovative behavioral science that can be shown to young kids as it does not contain any explicit material unlike other shows. Sheldon's character is really funny and his jokes make me laugh for hours together. However, as funny as Seasons 1-5 were, I think they don't have a story for the show going forward and neuroscience/behavior of experimental physicists is going to last only a few more seasons. Not entirely sure how the show is going to end.<br/><br/>But compared to two and half men or two broke girls, this show has the comedy to make people laugh and numerous references to movies, TV shows most of which I love to watch.<br/><br/>My favorite moment is the arrangement of carbon atoms, protons and neutrons in the pit and Leonard trying to get Sheldon out.<br/><br/>My second favorite moment (I had to write this) is the episode where the parking space is disputed between Sheldon and Leonard. *** Spoiler Alert***<br/><br/>I'm ashamed to watch this show, as to how much this show talking rubbish and is full of crap about Indian culture, gods, goddesses etc. Frankly, whoever the director is, is full of crap and definitely knows nothing about India. <br/><br/>India has been criticized to heights and beyond limit.<br/><br/>I'm a big fan of How I met Your Mother and have watched the whole season (1-9). Whereas this particular show The Big Bang Theory is awful.<br/><br/>Big Bang Theory is possibly the least funny series to be passed off as a comedy since How I met your Mother. The character of Leonard is actually tolerable, but Sheldon is repulsive! His sarcasm, rudeness and general nastiness is enough to make a viewer want to do him serious bodily harm. The cute blonde is eye candy to make the scenes with the dweebs tolerable, but other than that, this series is stultifyingly unfunny. The 2 AM test pattern on a Detroit public access channel has more entertainment value than The Big Bang Theory. I should have given 10, but then there would be no improvement; so I settle with 9. One of the thing I like about the TV sitcom is that they do not have to go the extra mile to create a complicated story line. The Big Bang Theory (TBBT) is a movie about geek with all their quirk and anomaly and how they deal with their everyday life. <br/><br/>The story line itself is quite simple, just like normal everyday life; but I think this is the trick to make a good movie. Don't create a complicate story (which in other type of genre is always the case) and just follow what any normal people will do in their real life. With this recipe and some funny notes, what you will get is something like TBBT, a very good and funny sitcom. <br/><br/>Let's just say, this is a TV series worth of spending your time in a good and fun way. Leonard is the star because he is the most normal of the 3. Sheldon is insufferably annoying in that he has to be Mr. Know It All, and that he feels the need to always be in control, especially in regards to tasks such as picking up his food from the restaurant and it is not precisely to his liking. Recently saw the episode where Leonard's mother comes for a visit and now I realize why he seems thrive on doing for others, although because subconsciously he despises waiting on others he tends to not to do things as per their instructions. A line needs to be drawn and there comes a time when one needs to grow beyond those habits we are use to especially if they harm us emotionally/physically, Leonard simply needs to tell Sheldon that if he is going to be so particular he should go and get his own food order. Penny is nothing more than the token piece of eye candy, how dare she dump Leonard after 1 date, he is by far to good for someone of her nature. Harold, the guy is insanely needy. The last episode I caught was about Cooper sticking his nose into Leonard's and Stephanie's love life, the show ends where, think Raj says hey! it appears Leonard has changed his Face Book relationship status to dating Dr. Stephanie Barnett, which upset Leonard, because he figured coming off as being so desperate would end his relationship with Stephanie, yet had the opposite effect Stephanie changed her relationship status to dating Dr. Leonard Hofstadter, which is completely unrealistic. Being a great fan of The big bang theory, i am pretty much fascinated by Dr. Sheldon cooper and his unique actions. I am desperately waiting for next episode to air. Big bang theory team have put immense effort in producing such a wonderful and entertaining show. I stumbled across this site http://bit.ly/IrAGw0 which has Dr. Sheldon Cooper funny quotes. Pretty hilarious blog post... Specially season 5 episodes rock and those were awesome. Looking forward for more of Kaley cucuoo... Well, we family of 6 all of us never miss to watch the episode of TBBT. Thanks IMDb for allowing me to write this review of my favorite TV show. I'll admit, at first I thought this show was rather lame, while watching my first couple of episodes I thought the antics were corny and I couldn't really see myself laughing at my past nerdy self, but as time went on I grew to enjoy the show. It has any element of empathy for the main characters, and a comedic style much different than most other television show airing today.<br/><br/>The show has its ups and downs just like any other on television, but it manages to keep coming up with new ways to make you laugh. Also the main characters are much different than what you'd normally see. Usually in comedies you have either all perfect poster boys/girls everywhere, or the typical funny fat guy, but the skinny 'nerds' have you cheering for the unsung hero. They make fun of these types of guys a lot in the show, but you are really laughing with them more than anything, and even though they are typically making more high-brow jokes, they're not over your head at all. I enjoy the show very much. I could go on and on about some of the jokes being recycled like some of the other reviews, but what's the point? Funny is funny! I've heard dozens of different comedians use the same material - told with their own twist sure - but its the same joke. More importantly - ITS STILL FUNNY!<br/><br/>The characters are, in my opinion, just as well rounded and likable as almost every other sitcom - obviously they aren't perfect - but then neither am I. <br/><br/>What more can I say? I like it. It's a tongue in cheek comedy - don't try to read to much into it and you'll laugh your ass off. This show us awful. Annoying. And makes you want to smash kittens. A co-worker recommended this show to me. I watched it and e-mailed him a review. I thought as long as I have a review, I may as well post it. I only watched one episode (The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification).<br/><br/>First of all, I should say that network sitcoms are not my thing. Something about the rhythm of straight line, set-up line, punch-line, laugh-trackstraight line, set-up line, punch-line, laugh-track, etc. that kind of makes me seasick.<br/><br/>On the plus side:<br/><br/> Good joke writers  Somewhat original  A little offbeat; which I like<br/><br/>On the bad side:<br/><br/> Cartoonish characters; kind like a French farce  I haven't watched a network sitcom in 15 years or so. I can't remember if the laugh-track was always so prevalent or if it's a modern development but it just seemed silly to have a laugh-track after every line of dialogue. This alone made it unwatchable.  I don't mean to sound like a snob but I can still remember when sitcoms like Seinfeld and Cheers had two or three story lines in each show; which were interwoven into an overall theme. They had jokes but they were worked into a plot. It was like a little 22 minute play but it was funny. This was just a premise (Bob wants to be a robot) and sixty or so jokes written around that premise.<br/><br/>I guess I've been spoiled by cable sitcoms but I just can't watch this stuff. I give it a 6 out of 10. As I've read many reviews, both good and bad, I've noticed a pattern. The people who vote it high have been between ones who get the simplistic humor to those who understand the more subtle adult and more analytical humor involved in this show. There are many episodes filled with multiple instances of ridiculous slapstick humor, and some that use very little basic how and take a step beyond to give you more hearty humor that actually requires thought to understand and fully enjoy. I've watched this show for years and fully enjoy every aspect of it, especially the constant nerd-isms and ridiculous bromancing that sometimes seem to drone on without rhyme or reason. <br/><br/>That being said, the ones who are down voting it have all said basically the same thing: "the humor is lacking and the script is not well written," etc. For those people all I have to say is that the script and humor being over your head just means that you are the percentage of people in this world that is either uneducated or too lazy to think. The other shows that you reference as being more comical were canceled because they were on a SpongeBob, zombie zoning out on the couch, no thinking involved level. If you don't understand something, it does not make it bad, it just makes you inferior. WHY does everyone always play with their food & never eat? So much of the show is centered on food, which is wasted, I am thinking. There are so many starving people in this world so that does bother me. Is it possible that they can be doing something else or is it all fake food? It would be great to get an answer. I guess I'm a high-functioning autist who, as Sheldon said somewhere, took up the trade of medicine as a backup plan, and my son is formally diagnosed and is a particle physicist. We love this show. Not just because it portrays life as autists, but because it takes the time to teach us about you humans. The ongoing ups and downs of the relationship between Leonard and Penny are entrancing, and even distressingly realistic. Season four onwards loses something - too many repeated jokes, too much of the overplayed lack of social skills, and the character of Amy is a caricature rather than a believable ASD person. The first season and maybe the second are true to life for some of us and no doubt educational for the rest of the audience. I suspect the brief fad of nerdiness being fashionable has had something to do with the less impressive later seasons. The Big Bang Theory is one of my 2 favourite TV shows. It was a good idea for a TV show and it was really well done. Seasons 1-3 were hilarious with great acting and good episode stories. <br/><br/>Sheldon, Penny, Raj, and Howard were all really great characters. <br/><br/>However after season 4 the dynamics of the show and its characters changed hugely. Howard went from being the funny horny engineer and changed into being the boring husband of Bernadette. Raj is normally good for about 1 laugh in each episode and still can do that. Sheldon and Penny were always great and still are good but they are too heavily carrying the show in my opinion. Leanord I thought was always kind of boring but later on they tried to turn the nerdy Leanord into a ladies man of sorts which just isn't his character.<br/><br/>The biggest problem I thought was in the newer characters and there effects on the show especially the Amy character. After the Amy character was introduced episodes were to heavily reliant around her character, and the problem with that is that her character is annoying. The episodes that revolve around her are just kind of boring and kind of needless. <br/><br/>Overall its still one of my favourite shows but its easy to see that the changes made to the dynamics of the show have resulted on it heading downhill. This show is one of the best shows on television. I am absolutely in love with it. Penny , Raj , Leonard , Howard & of course Sheldon Cooper are the main characters with the recent additions Amy & Bernadette. Watching each episode is an absolute delight . This show is way different from other sitcoms as it centers around these geeks , accept for Penny , who is an aspiring actress . If i am down I just watch any of the episodes of the Big Bang Theory & all my worries are forgotten & I am laughing my heart out. Definitely watch this show if you want to see a good comedy show. I give 10 on 10 for The Big Bang Theory. I assure you that if you watch this show you will fall in love with it. I love this series. I even buy each year as it becomes available. Which is something I don't normally do. The casting for the series could not be better. Every main character is great. The group dynamics is outstanding and fuuuuuunnnnnny!!! I wasn't sure about adding a potential love interest for Sheldon but it fits in extremely well. I looked Mayim Bialik up online to see what was up. I remember her from Blossom when she was a lot younger but nothing else. I was pleasantly surprised to find out she has a PHD in Neuroscience which actually makes herb a lot smarter than the rest of the cast as far as I can tell. It is nice to see an actor/actress put education first and in such an erudite subject. How Jim Parsons continues to do such an excellent job of playing Sheldon after six seasons is a testament to his abilities. I wonder if Penny and Leonard will ever say "I do", probably not till the last season if then, or maybe if Kaley Cuoco gets preggers. This is still the funniest series currently airing in my opinion. Yes, yes it is. The whole idea of Big Bang Theory is amazing. Sheldon has to be the BEST character is any media. Jim Parsons portrays him so well it's unbelievable. The man is my idol. Leonard is also very funny, I love how nerdy he is but want to 'fit in'. Penny is an amazing character. She is hilarious and probably one of the funniest female characters around. Howard and Raj, too, are very amusing. Howard being creepy but lovable at the same time and the fact Raj can't speak to women unless drunk is comedy genius.<br/><br/>I am so glad that this show has been as successful as it has been. Jim Parsons, Kaley Cuoco, Johnny Galecki, Simon Helberg, Kunal Nayyar are 5 of the best actors in the world.<br/><br/>Amy Farrah Fowler (Sheldon's 'love interest') is just amazing. I personally love her.<br/><br/>Last thing, Sheldon's mother is the best mother ever. She is brilliantly played by Laurie Metcalf. Laurie has been amazing in all the things she has done (Desperate Housewives, Toy Story and Scream 2).<br/><br/>BEST PROGRAMME EVER! Some shows should stay on the air and some should be canceled immediately and, 'The Big Bang Theory' needs to stay! I criticize many shows I like - because I spot some potential for failure - not for this show. It is so funny, I trust the authors. The stories are all hysterical and the cast is all excellent. I will have to say that this is probably the funniest or one of the funniest shows on TV. The writers need a raise and so do all the cast members. It was also nice to see Blossom in the show - what a great addition she is - I bet she is happy to see that her Ph. D was good for something (just kidding - I have always liked her.) This is a brilliant show with a brilliant cast. Please - leave well enough alone and continue forward with a working formula. I've seen every episode, episode 9 season 4 inclusive, For some reason I continue to watch although only rarely do I find a laugh. Maybe it was a little more engrossing before Leonard hooked up with Penny, same as Friends was before Ross did Rachael. I bet many can relate to longing for a women who perhaps is seen or we feel is out of our league, We root for Leonard and wish we had his success. I enjoy a character with no interest in the opposite sex whatever in Sheldon. He as the opposite of the three others works well, bet it would work almost as well if a Sheldon character had cameras on every aspect of their lives and was making his sly observations from a spaceship orbiting earth. His long and abstruse soliloquies on the smallest of topics are still entertaining enough, kind of like a platonic Larry David with a science degree. I will be honest I just joined the fanship recently but I absolutely LOVE this show! And we just saw the best episode of the season, and maybe the series TONIGHT! "Adhesive Duck Deficiency" The best scenes were with the guys camping for a 'science' project. It was meant for the meteor shower and actually they ended up HIGH forgetting why they went there in the first place instead. They told stories of their past; Howard slept with his second cousin, Raj wanted to be the Rabbit KING and Leonard (LeoNERD) hating his name. That entire storyline was probably the funniest they've had for a long time.<br/><br/>The second plot with Sheldon and Penny was enjoyable but wasn't as strong as the camping scenes. SP Shippers would think differently but as much as I enjoyed the 'boob' scene, Sheldon driving (when he's only practiced on a simulator) and the ER scene. The most enjoyed scene (for me anyway) was the 'Soft Kitty' round.<br/><br/>And though I may be new, I am all caught up as if I've been a fan for the entire run.<br/><br/>If you haven't already joined the bandwagon, better jump on before there is no more room.<br/><br/>What am I saying? There is always room.<br/><br/>The more the merrier! :) The comedy of four grad school,science and technology geeks who can hardly function in the "real" world and the hot young co-ed who lives next door(and fancies one of them,as they all are agog over her),fills out the content of this generally well-cast,well-written and well-timed addition to the CBS line-up. From Chuck Lorre,the creator of "Two and a half men" and "DArma and Greg",this show doesn't seem to have any direct aim(i.e. a burning romance)so much as many interpersonal problems between and among the characters who all languish in their own personal problems. No actors really stand out here,but Johnny Galecki,Jim Parsons and Kaley Cuoco(as the hottie,duh)seem to excel if I were pressed to make a choice.<br/><br/>Probably no revelation,but it's still quite the observation to put people with socializing problems who are quite brilliant in their given fields--and in this case Science--up against situations that all the book-learning and natural proclivity cannot solve. In a word:chemistry(and not the stuff in books). I have no idea how long this show can last,but I think if the network gives this show a chance,you could see quite the show blossom. If you haven't caught it yet,well,you're in luck cause it's summer(at this writing) and the way the Tiffany net has been using this to plug holes in the sched, you should have plenty of opportunities to catch a show or two. This is the best comedy series ive watch, the actors are really good they pull you in the show like its real! Id wish they made an new season for this too bad it ended. I've only liked two sitcoms enough to buy or binge watch them, and this is one (the other is That 70's Show). There might be one more, but I can't think of it.<br/><br/>Wish they'd bring it back. Young Sheldon is alright, but just not the same (maybe I like multi-camera sitcoms more). I have a confession to make.<br/><br/>I used to love The Big Bang Theory.<br/><br/>The now-famous sitcom about four nerdy scientists, a not-so-nerdy blonde girl, and their escapades was a show I once looked forward to every week. And indeed, I still feel the show has its moments, especially in the early seasons.<br/><br/>But now, I can safely say I don't love Big Bang Theory. Not anymore.<br/><br/>Perhaps "love" is an overstatement, though. When I said I loved Big Bang Theory, what I meant is that I loved parts of Big Bang Theory. Because in hindsight, Big Bang Theory has always been a mixed bag, even back in its glory days.<br/><br/>The best part of Big Bang Theory has always been Sheldon. He was a very unique character and by far the best character in the whole show (in fact, without Sheldon, I highly doubt Big Bang Theory would have been nearly as successful as it is). I loved any episode focusing on Sheldon. Of course, Sheldon would be insufferable in real life, and it is a wonder that anyone is still friends with him.<br/><br/>Howard is another character I found rather entertaining. I enjoyed his sarcasm and his attempts to be a ladies' man while failing miserably at it. I also loved any scene where Howard argued with his mother. But in later seasons, when he settled down with Bernadette, I have found him to be only a so-so character.<br/><br/>Raj was a character who, for a long time, I didn't have strong feelings about one way or the other. He was just there. The point when I decided I disliked Raj was Season 8, when he instantaneously became able to speak to women normally for no reason. He just can now. In addition, I've found Raj to be annoying and unpleasant in general.<br/><br/>And then there's my least favorite part of the show, Leonard. In addition to the character himself, who I always considered whiny and not particularly funny, I always disliked the forced relationship drama between Leonard and Penny, who I also don't find particularly interesting. Leonard and Penny have no chemistry whatsoever; they have nothing in common, they don't support each other, and they mostly spend their time making snide remarks at each other. The "relationship drama" (such that it is) always follows the same formula:<br/><br/>Leonard and Penny are spending time together.
Leonard says or does something stupid that could have easily been avoided if he used a lick of common sense.
Penny gets angry and overreacts.
Leonard and Penny argue and get snippy at each other for a while.
Leonard and Penny eventually make up and smooth things over, only to bicker again in another episode.<br/><br/>I always hated those scenes. They just irritated me more than anything.<br/><br/>But I always overlooked these scenes because I watched the show for the science jokes and nerd references, not for the relationship drama. But the later seasons would forgo these jokes in favor of more relationship drama. In hindsight, though, most of the nerd references were just characters mentioning completely mainstream geek interests (Star Wars, Star Trek, superheroes, etc.) by name without doing anything funny or clever with them. And many of the "science jokes" were just sex jokes dressed up with scientific jargon and fancy $10 words to make the jokes sound smarter than they actually were. There is also a sense that Big Bang Theory encourages the audience to laugh at (not with) the characters simply for being nerds.<br/><br/>Regardless, these jokes have been pushed aside for the most part, especially since Amy and Bernadette became series regulars, causing even more relationship drama to ensue. Amy was introduced as an awkward nerd similar to Sheldon, but she has since become a plain, boring character whose entire existence revolves around her wanting sex. As for Bernadette, I originally didn't think much of her, but now I actively dislike her for being a hateful, condescending shrew who constantly puts down Howard. Both of these women regularly belittle their men for not being godlike adonises and for having the audacity to enjoy nerdy things like science fiction and comic books, but Bernadette is more aggressive about it. I regret to say these characters have contributed to reshaping Big Bang Theory from a unique sitcom about science and nerds into a cookie-cutter sitcom about sex and relationships.<br/><br/>All of these elements put together have made me realize that, nerd motif aside, Big Bang Theory is essentially Friends, a show that I found too lowest-common-denominator to enjoy. All this time, my former love of Big Bang Theory came from what I wanted it to be (a comedy about nerds and science), not for what it is actually was (a CBS sitcom).<br/><br/>While The Big Bang Theory does have its moments, my tastes have grown since I started watching the show as a teenager. I discovered more sophisticated comedy, including shows with actual nerd humor like Futurama and Rick and Morty.<br/><br/>Sadly, Big Bang Theory doesn't match my tastes anymore. With its dip in quality and the sense that it's not as good as I remember overall, perhaps it's for the best that the show ends with Season 12. It makes it easier to say goodbye to the show that all started with the Big Bang. This show is not for everyone. Most people will agree that the first few seasons are very good, but after that there is a divide. The turn it takes changes the show, and most fans don't like it. Despite the fact that the qiality is lowered as the show becomes more "standardized", and it is taken into a new, more mature direction, i'm not one of those.<br/><br/>I gave it nine stars because i feel the turn is not as bad as people say it is. I actually kinda liked how the characters "grew up".<br/><br/>EDIT: I have rewatched the show from first to last episode, and my opinion has changed. I love it. I give it 10 stars now. And i don't just do that for any show. In fact only three or four shows got ten stars from me. It trully deserves ten stars.
What i said about it changing after the first few seasons and becoming more like other shows still stands. However i was reminded of one key thing: i trully cared about the main characters. And that was never the case before, even when it comes to shows i rated with 10 stars.
There is always something to laugh about when you watch this, and even when it became less sciency and more centered on relationships it kept the feel of earlier seasons. Quality did go up and down, and sure sometimes an episode was a six or a seven, but even they have that authentic feel in them.<br/><br/>All of the people complaining about the change should really think long and hard why they liked it in the first place. Bringing in so much of the relationships and babies was a downer. But what was annoying from the start was the studio audience. They're rolling in the aisles with stupid laughter every time any of the characters blinked. Good comedys don't need a studio audience. Maybe they realized that by not having one for Young Sheldon. But I still love TBBT and I'll be sorry to see it go. This show is awful and that's a shame I actually think Season 1 isn't too bad. But after the first season it went downhill fast with annoying character traits and catchphrases. This show has also devolved from a show about geniuses in modern life to their nerds who are trying to get women working in pop culture to the integrity of the show (really Fortnite it's like they want this show to be awful). I'm glad to know this show is going to end soon but if it had been cancelled around season 3 I think this show would be remembered fondly like Friends or How I Met Your Mother Every joke is how nerds are funny because they're nerds. Everyone keeps showing me episodes trying to get me to like it, but I have yet to laugh even once. This show has great reviews and incredible ratings, yet I don't know a single person who admits to watching it. Who are the people watching this show? Who actually thinks it's funny. I've seen 17,342 commercials this show and haven't even chuckled at a single one. Yes I'm a cynical grump. The most over played show in the history of television I particularly hate it when the comedy channel runs a 5 day long bloody marathon of it during Christmas, glad to hear it's ending...I hope we don't continue to get smothered with reruns Was brilliant before the girls were introduced... Seemed about nerds and science.. Then it went to relationships and money In my opinion this is a great show. Everything need development, therefore how the characters evolve throughout the series is completely understandable.
For instance Raj's character is depicted as a hopeless guy who manage to tackle his biggest obstacle and finally become who he always wanted to be, just like we do in real life. I'm pretty sure that after a few season his silence would've become a topic of arguments between people complaining about a lack of innovation and even stating that the show is monotone. Used to be funny show, but after Bernadette appeared, mode killer, Really terrible character, very bad casting, and her voice, her look ewwww I'm surprised to read so many negative reviews. Yes, the show has changed from where it started. In defense, this isn't The Simpsons, where you can have zero character development for years and get away with it. With that being said, there are things that sadden me. The character Penny being chief among them. Her character started out being cute all of the time, hot when she wanted to be. This isn't just in her physical appearance, but in attitude as well. When she smiled she lit up the room. She was happy, and bubbly. When she fell in love with Leonard it was because she recognized the value in having someone who loved her and was a good man. Now... - Now things have changed. She's often cold. Doesn't seem to love Leonard at all. Seems like she's done with the relationship. It's bubbly anymore. Doesn't even try to be cute. Often times dressing more like Amy than Penny. I don't know who is to blame for these changes, so I won't place blame on anyone. With that being said, I LOVE Amy! Howard and Penny play off each other great, and Raj plays off everyone great. Honestly, they are the ones that I find myself laughing at. Sheldon hasn't made me laugh in a long time, Leonard and Penny either. Again, I don't blame the actors. Because I don't know who's setting the tone of the show. This show still holds a warm place in my heart. And I do understand where people are coming from longing for the earlier seasons. In some ways I do as well. But I can also appreciate the great things that character development has added to the show. The success of this show has always amazed and confused me. How anyone could ever believe these characters would survive past episode 1 is beyond my ability to comprehend. In the real world, especially in the Southern California 'real world', these nerds, who possess the inter-active social skills of a speed bump, would not have the slightest chance of establishing a relationship with hot girl Penny, regardless of the fact she happened to live across the hall. She (Penny) would have left this crew behind after the first conversation ended with Sheldon saying, when asked what they did for fun, "Well today, we masturbated for money." It would have surely ended after Sheldon felt it was perfectly acceptable behavior to enter her apartment, while she was sleeping, to clean. The first encounter with Howard and his constant sexual harassment, which is exactly what is is, dear fans, make no mistake, would see her, in all probability, moving away. The addition of characters like Amy (the semi-lesbian who makes more sexual harassment comments to Penny than she ever does to the man she is, allegedly, attracted to), and Bernadette, who you spend more time looking at wondering what's wrong with the shape of her body, with a voice that makes you want to poke your eardrums with an ice pick, to Stewart, a (once) minor character, who must be related to, or who has blackmailed someone on the production crew, who has evolved into a full-blown credits worthy main character, but who has way out-lived his usefulness to the show, assuming he ever had any to begin with. You just want to slap wimpy-kid Leonard and tell him to grow a pair. His character is THE most obnoxious of them all. I'm not certain he's even acting. That's just the way he's played all his roles. The only 'real' actors in the cast are Jim Parsons and Simon Helberg. If you've seen Parsons in other roles, you understand his range (Hidden Figures is a good example). Same with Helberg. He's an accomplished musician and actor. He's just an obnoxious womanizer on this show. The writers/producers assume way too much regarding what these geniuses are capable of doing and understanding. Because you are a physicist, does not necessarily mean you spend your days playing Dungeons and Dragons, can recite dialogue from every Star Wars movie ever made, have such a fetish for comic books that you own thousands of them or are capable of reformatting computer hard drives and installing partitions and separate operating systems, or, for that matter, can speak Klingon.<br/><br/>In reality, the BBT should have ended after season 3. There was just nothing believable in any of the writing of this show. Episode after episode the brain-washing continued to the point where you find yourself watching (and applauding) Penny marrying Leonard.<br/><br/>And yet, here we are going into season, what? 11? 12? With the primary cast making $1 million an episode. Really? $1 million Dollars?? People who have jobs that actually make a difference in the world don't make that kind of money. I guess it's best I'm not the head of programming for CBS. This show would not have survived beyond the pilot. When is season 9 coming you can't just stop the show when Sheldon wants to propose to Amy you just can't . And lended and penny driving to vegas to get married you can't stop the show with these 2 huge things about to happen!!!!!!!!!!!ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡if you don't carry on at least tell me how it was going to end!!! And 1more thing if Sheldon watched this show he would be furious on how the show ended This show was pure gold at first when it was just Penny and the boys: when Sheldon was never open to the possibility of a relationship because of his social awkwardness and inability to understand people, when Raj couldn't speak with a girl around, and a hot girl moves in. It was genius and hilarious. The introduction of Bernadette and Amy ruined this show. Their characters are awful and intensely annoying and unfunny. Their introduction also ruined other character's story lines. Sheldon never would've ended up dating a girl the way they wrote him in with Amy. Howard was perfect when he was the overly horny nerd, and him marrying and settling down with Bernadette ruined his character. They couldn't figure out how to keep Raj the silent character so they made him talk to girls and even date as well. Which was pathetic writing. Making Penny fit in with all of them ended up removing the hot, dumb blonde girl around nerds effect that made the show great to begin with. Now, they just made it more like "Friends" instead of the clashing personalities dynamic that made this show good.<br/><br/>Just watch Seasons 1-5, skip the rest. I was binge watching this and there is only 2 seasons of this show which I didnt like which us 6 and 7 while others are just pretty great , and i also want to add that this the which improved my ENGLISH so well . As a sitcom, its own label is extremely attractive. The characters with different personalities, the plot with rich imagination and hilarious lines make this American TV series regarded as a classic in the first season. So much better than friends! I love the geeks, love how they get the girls... honestly it's so much better seeing a show where the geeks are cool! Hope they are going to make more seasons! Ive been watching this and keep wondering when its going to end and im binge watching on netflix there are certain problems that i dont know are there on purpose or not. firstly there is never closure but instead we have the feeling of abandonment to any story line episodic or continuous.
too much screen time given to the wrong characters eg Cooper later or even at the beginning he feels weird i mean how many times a character says a sentence in scientific way would end being not funny? in this sitcom the answer is none, it becomes boring and even annoying, repeated stories but different jokes and different episodes, there are good build up to the stories but cant cash because of the total abandonment, jokes are not relevant and are unfunny. good characters never able to shine because of certain characters shadow. you can keep watching it does not end how much ever you wish for it and it keeps getting dumber and unfunny. i can get behind dumb and long sitcoms but an unfunny thats the line for me. story progression is slow
But it has its moments it does get funny but that rare 2-3 good jokes per episode, some episodes are full on funny. some character will are just too funny but not given enough screentime
Should you watch it? Yes, if you have weeks to waste. No, if you can find anything else to watch. and i dont find later seasons re-watchable because they were difficult to watch the first time What a pleasure it has been to watch this superb tv series over the years. Sheldon Cooper is a magnificent and unique comic character played faultlessly by Jim Parsons. Leonard, Penny, Rajesh, Howard, Bernadette, Amy and the other supporting characters are also deftly drawn and brought to life by a superb ensemble cast without a weak link amongst them. This show has laugh out loud moments, great wit, warmth, intellect and a penchant for geeky science fiction references at every turn. It also has numerous fun cameos from an array of science fiction stars, including amongst others Leonard Nimoy, Katee Sackhoff, Mark Hamill and William Shatner! Better still the great Stephen Hawking also honours it with a recurring presence. I'll miss this show a lot and will no doubt soon be restarting the fun at Series 1, Episode 1. I'd suggest you do the same. Remember when I first met them in Season 1, Sheldon was a definite nerd. While in the decades since TBBT aired, the characters have grown. The nerds have found their love, too (oh, come on, Raj). TBBT was finally finished, it was a pity, but I'm glad to see the characters' happiness. Admitted someone whose mother tongue is not English thinks it's a good show to learn English, I think it's somewhat distracted.
The contents are a little clinched though I know the reason I make this comment is because I have watched excessive similar show.
All in all, in funny aspect, it is good, but not as good as Friends, and the plot hasn't been designed perfectly. Sometimes everything happened abruptly. For instance, Penny fell in love with Leonard in the first episode.... This is a sitcom, similar to the American sitcom only saw "growing pains", absolute classic ~ but I think this comedy is more suitable for adults ~ ha ha! Sheldon is annoying but so is Amy. She has no charisma and her fashion sense doesnt get any better through the 12 seasons. Also those layered & baggy clothes make her look big in front of Penny & Berny. But all the other characters are funny & clever. I dont know why Raj is forever alone even when Stuart is in a stable relationship. That is something the makers should have put more thought into. I love it and I often watch it while eating. But the ending is soooooooo sad. One of the all time best series ... each and every individual character individually stay in our heart forever ..every character has been perfectly characterised.... with the most beautiful ending possible.. must watch I'm leaving this review as a token for myself in the future, just so I could compare my future opinion when I progress further into the show. Keep in mind I've only watched season 1-3, so any further episodes are unreviewed.<br/><br/>I've thoroughly enjoyed the show so far. Most episodes seem interesting & the characters have interesting personalities. It's a well-earned break from classical TV shows that trademarks the most stale humour in the world, featuring typical families that are meant to be "relatable".<br/><br/>I've learned it's meant to be watched as a lighthearted comedy and not to overthink certain situations. Some fallacies occur occasionally, but they lead to an amusing plot. I don't agree with the consensus that it is educational, as I've hardly learnt anything accept from the chicken joke, haha. But I do admit it has given me a slight motivational boost towards my education.<br/><br/>The general direction of the show is heading south, more towards the family-friendly comedies. The character's desperate need for approval from women really drains the fun. When romantic relationships came into the picture, I started disliking all these sudden problems because I really didn't care about them. I felt as if the relationships could be featured, but not constantly because it's meant to be about 4 scientists doing dumb stuff.<br/><br/>Eh, different and intriguing. 8/10 Although the play carried out its absurd and hilarious theme throughout, it did not appear on the surface, but focused on dialysis the essence of the plot, digging deeper into the true meaning of inner emotions, and in the field of emotions, the screenwriters praised and praised friendship for the highest proportion of.<br/><br/>Even if they hate each other and fight for each other, it is often these "bad friends" who can rush up at the critical moment. The characters' sincere and beautiful friendship and family-like warm atmosphere left a deep impression on the audience. Sheldon is quite unique character and acting is cool. But Jokes aren't high quality,they are often simple and easy. It's good sitcom to watch and have fun,when you're not thinking.
It feels big impact from old sitcoms and many things are copied in this show,for example love story and other storylines,episodes.
This show have to ended more early and it would be better! It is a damn entertaining show, with characters that have got depth and with their stories completing full circle within the show..unlike many other such shows! It's a worth watch.... For its genre and specially for science and comic buffs..! The show is remarkable from season 1 - 5. Almost all of the episodes are super funny. I can safely rate 9.5 / 10 for the first 5 seasons<br/><br/>The show takes a big blow from Season 6. Its like watching the same thing over and over again. All of these seasons are based on relationships. Rarely some episode is funny. If I wanted to see relationship related drama, I better watch Indian TV shows or Bollywood shows<br/><br/>Some of the episodes are so boring, I had to fast forward through them. The writing is too terrible as if written by the customers of Stuart<br/><br/>At season 9 I had given up. I stopped watching this, but eventually had to resume just to know if it gets any better<br/><br/>The humor element from the 1st 5 seasons never comes back. Even the last season is hopeless<br/><br/>Amy's character was a complete waste, it should 'not' have received that much screen time + I don't recollect any funny action from her side<br/><br/>Other than Penny's character, no other character seems to grow or change in any way. They are just the same. Same insults, same faces, almost same dialogues. Penny is portrayed as a dumb character from the start, but eventually you realize she is the best if not smartest. She is a delight in all seasons but in S12 she is radiant / iridescent<br/><br/>The words 'Apologize', 'Change', 'Sorry', 'Toast' and many more keep repeating till the end. Very frustrating In the first few seasons, this was outstanding, and consistently funny. But its premise should make it a niche show at best. The well drawn characters are what made it work so well, alongside its approach towards scientists and academia.<br/><br/>As time went on, the original elements that mode it so funny grew stale, and rather than finish things on a high, they introduced new concepts to keep the show going. All were less funny than what they had, and the quality of the show went slowly downhill. Character traits, that were originally hysterically funny became annoying, and the show became almost a parody of itself.<br/><br/>The first few seasons are definitely worth watching (I rated them 9-10), after that its down to your preferences. This show was really long trip but so funny and also mature in some episodes. It shows how important is to have friends. Definitely a show to see. Also the final backstage is really sad but worth watching. One of my favorite film series ever made. Has all of the things that are needed to create a great series. One of a kind TV show that tells the tale of 4 nerds and their social interactions of everyday life. Great comedy, teaches things, and has a mix of sci-fi that you don't see everyday. Absolutely love this show. Not watched in a long time actually, think I need to do some watching again ðŸ˜Š The characters of the show are really strong. Sheldon's character from being annoying to super loving gonna make everyone fall in love with the show. The show has a humor of it's own, the best show to binge watch. Has an amazing story ,No comparison with 'Friends'.It was bad of Jim Parsons to not accept the contract for season 13. Will make you a little bit nostalgic by the old 80s references . In all a great show and a MUSTWATCH The Big bang theory that's right the name alone provides with sufficient information about the show that it is based on "Science" but wait a minute is it just a science related series? Hell No, It's a Sitcom (a situation comedy) based on mainly five characters Sheldon, Leonard, Penny, Raj and Howard, a Warner Bros production directed by Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady.
Now move on to the show, Physicist Sheldon who got his PhD at 16 and Physicist Leonard live together and they have got a new neighbor Penny, an aspiring actor as well as a part time worker in the cheese Cake factory. The story start with them but Raj and Howard friends of Leonard also start visiting them to fill the show with more humor. Each episode comes up with more interesting story, sometimes about new inventions or sometimes with new guests.
Every persona is distinct and their acting skills are incredible. Jim Parsons who played Sheldon is a winner of four Prime Amy awards and the Golden Globe, and Johnny Galecky as Leonard was one of the highest paid actors of the world for his character in The Big Bang Theory.
I found the role of Sheldon Cooper most attractive because of his eccentric behavior who faces problems in social conventions and that's the thing that makes the scenes hilarious but Leonard the sweet little guy is always there to support his friend. Raj is an Indian guy with Indian accent and Howard is a Jewish who still lives with his Mom. All these interesting characters filled every episode with fun and amusements.
Highly recommended, you will experience a remarkable journey with them. I love the characters,this show made me laugh a lot. Okay, the show is absolutely funny, without a doubt the show always makes me laugh. Howard is by far my favourite character. All off then cast are funny. The negatives, Sheldon can be a big too much, it's a shame the creators never toned him down a little. Also now and again the race jokes are unnecessary as it's a family show. For sure the creators are democratics. The Big Bang Theory is a great show! Ive been watching it for quite a few years now and its really funny and entertaining. Sheldon is the best character followed by Leonard and Penny but i also like Raj and Howard too. Ill always be watching this show! ...BBT got old after a while, same kind of humor for too long.
Altough I always considered it to be one of the more decent comedy shows airing at the time, there were two things of it's general setup I never liked at all:
<ul><li>Some of the acting/depicting was spot on, like Sheldon with Aspergers. A lot of the geeky behavior was not, as a long time geek (pen and paper, MMOs, everything Fantasy/Sci-Fi, etc.), a lot of displayed behavior looked to me like "this is how Chuck thinks geeky people behave" and not "this is exactly like we could have behaved discussing a dungeons &amp; dragons rule to death."</li><li>Some of the behavior, prime example was how most of the others treated Stewart, was very borderline bullying, or in some situations, outright mean and nasty.</li></ul> It's not my first choice of comedy but it is a good watch when bored. It's one of them comedy's where it's only or never funny the first time. I don't see it much as comedy, especially the later seasons, it's more of a story with relationships. The ending was probably a perfect way to send it off. I have all the dvds and always seem to be a third choice, so they must have done something write with the writing. There is not much else to say but I would give it a 6.5/7 I remember watching F.R.I.E.N.D.S. growing up with the show, waiting every week for the next episode! This series makes you laugh till your cheeks hurt and makes you feel happy even in the short episodes. Just love, love, loved!! Need I say more?<br/><br/>Just try watching it without a laughtrack and see how you like it then. This show was able to put together the perfect mix of actors and characters they play to create a truly unique and hilarious sitcom. The play on their nerdy outsider personas really add an element of comedy that is new and fun. I haven't watch the entire episodes yet but so far, something worth watching if to give you a good laugh after a tough day at work. Just finished the last episode of the last season of The Big Bang Theory. It's hard to believe it was twelve years ago, when me, my sister, and our friends started to watch this series. It's been a long and wonderful journey. I'm really grateful to everybody who was involved in this project. The BBT is so funny and nerdy, wise and humanistic, entertaining and telling you a billion interesting things about our Universe. Its characters truly became kinda family for all thankful fans all over the world. So many things happened during this dozen of years. To think about it, my life completely changed - and I like it a lot! As Sheldon said: changes are the only constant in our life. And I'm so happy that I still have my family and friends I used to have 12 years ago (though I live far away from majority of them now) - and I'm blessed to have now even more people that are really close to my heart! I am full of curiosity for the path that lays ahead :) I was sceptical as to how good this would be when I first started watching as American sitcoms just aren't usually my thing...12 seasons later and I'm sad to say goodbye. All the characters are just so different which brings diversity and allows us to see them grow as the show goes on, and if you were to take one out it just wouldn't be the same. It also makes the show funnier as you can approach jokes from so many more ways. The final seasons, I'll admit, perhaps took a slight hit in quality but nothing too major so I think they ended it and the right time. A very good and funny watch. I Talley live this show, it's light and funny and I can identify with the characters. Others have said some really mean and horrible things about the characters however I realty don't feel this way. Perhaps because I am close to people to have autism and I can see how Sheldon evolves and develops over the seasons: being nicer, falling in love, caring for people... all things people with autism struggle with. It's lovely to see Leonard with the beautiful girl and Howard and Bernadette. Yes it's stereotypical and over the top but it's supposed to be exaggerated. I love the show very funny interesting and the actors are very good A lot of emotions when I looking back at all these years with this show. My grownup life just like the show started with living with a group of nerdy boys and life was filled pure fun and simple frustration, then one by one we all have to leave each other and begin a new life with a new career or with a lover, and life progress into the soap opera we used to wish for. Life is also great and happy, but maybe with less stupid fun and more seriousness Despite the quality of the content being patchy in the latter series it's still a good series that will make you laugh and even cry on occasion. As I watched this I was hooked. It is awesome. I laughed at several Sheldon moments. I think all the characters were good. People should try this out if they haven't. Every episode I watch or rewatch I just laugh. If you like science and relationships and friendships and comedy you will be addicted to this show. You might even quote the show every now and then. October 2017, i'm strolling through Netflix looking for a TV show to watch. The one that catches my eye is The Big Bang Theory. Now i had seen an episode of it before and didn't think it looked bad. It was a Star Wars one, so that might also be one of the reasons why. Anyway, so i watched the first episode and really enjoyed it. I kept watching and found myself watching it pretty regularly. Then my mum started to watch it with me. Then my dad watched it and finally my sister. We finished watching the first ten seasons within the space of six months and we loved it. Now, while it may have decreased in quality a bit over the seasons, it never became bad. I could still tune in to a later episode and find myself enjoying it.
The large amount of seasons are actually worthwhile because of the character development. And this show has a lot of great character development. The best example of this is Howard. Ever since he introduced himself to Penny in the first episode, you knew this guy wasn't going to be normal. In the first two seasons, the guy lives with his mum and cares more about girls than his job. However, Bernadette changes him so much that by sixth series you've forgotten what he was like. This is why i love the scene in series 7 where he sings a song to Bernadette. It's a major reflection of the change the character had gone through. Now i don't even like Bernadette. She is by the far the worst character in the show and became too annoying near the end. In fact, she is probably the reason why i only gave it a 9. All the other characters are great in their own unique ways. However, she still does have some good lines like: "I like the Wii" and the one at Leonard and Penny's wedding where she says "I now pronounce you husband and wife. And weird other husband who came with the apartment." Howard's mother was also a great character despite us never actually seeing her. Her relentless shouting was always a treat to hear and it's such a shame that Carol died. However, the way they dealt with her death by killing her off in the show was great and lead to one of my favorite moments in the later series. All of the characters except Howard and Bernadette sat around talking about her. In the end, they all raise a glass to her and Leonard says "A loving mother... to all of us"
Now, my favorite episode in the entire show is Howard and Bernadette's wedding. This is because of the scene where Howard goes up to space and everyone is watching them. Raj and Bernadette hold hands over their love of Howard, Leonard and Penny hold hands and finally Sheldon's line. Sheldon is the most ignorant and arrogant person on earth and him and Sheldon rarely ever get along. Sheldon makes fun of Howard for being an engineer and Howard makes fun of Sheldon a lot. So, this is why this line hits so hard. As Howard is going up into space, Sheldon says "Boldly go Howard Wolowitz." Quite an underrated moment. However, Howard's best relationship in the entire film has to be with Raj. My third favorite character. Now, earlier on the focus on Howard and Raj's relationship is great but there isn't much focus on the character of Raj himself. This is partly because of the fact that he couldn't even talk to women unless he was drunk for half of the show. However, as the seasons progressed and less focus was put on Howard, Raj was given much more screen-time. However, as much as i love his character and his relationship with Howard, i have to admit the writers had no idea what to do with him. They had so much time to make him settle down with a woman but they either couldn't hire a long term actress or just couldn't decide who he should end up with. This is why i actually think they should have made him come out of the closet. I mean there had been so many jokes about Howard and Raj being a gay couple so i couldn't understand why they didn't do it. It'd be interesting to see how the others react and especially his parents. They would either accept or disapprove of it. This would lead to an interesting storyline. It would fit well with his personality traits (not homophobic just saying) and actually make sense of some of the dodgy lines he said. However, i'm glad at the end that he didn't end up with Anu and the scene between Raj and Howard was great. It was their last and ultimate romantic moment. The choice to leave Raj single at the end was brave and i respect it. Hopefully, they could make a spinoff of him but i'm just not entirely sure whether that would work after what happened with 'Joey.' Also, another great character is Stuart. The owner of the comic book store who starts off as a normal guy but ends up living with Howard and Bernadette, becoming close with Howard's mum and becomes a good friend of Raj. Also, can i just say how much i love Raj and Penny's relationship. I think it's pretty overlooked.
Anyway, back to the whole reason Big Bang Theory is as good as it is. Sheldon Cooper. He won in a poll for the funniest TV character of all time. He is amazing. He is the show. The show wouldn't be half as good as it is without him. His ignorance, arrogance, genius mind but sometimes childish behaviour makes him what he is. He ends every joke with the word 'Bazinga (which is used in an amazing ball pit scene) and gets his mum and Penny to sing 'Soft Kitty' to him when he is sick. He has his own spot on a couch to sit on which no one else can sit on either. The thermostat has to be on a certain temperature all the time.His disregard for others around him. His strong opinions on science especially with 'geology' don't even make him unlikable at all. However, his biggest strengths are the relationships with the people around him. Him and his best friend and roommate Leonard. All the way through, Leonard talks about how much he hates having to live with him and Sheldon constantly disregards him and his scientific work. However, you know they still love each other. Especially when Leonard cries at his wedding. His other great relationship is with him and Amy. The romantic relationship. Sheldon's a person who never would have thought about getting a girlfriend. I mean when my mum heard about it, she had no idea how they would pull it off. And yet they did it so well. Amy is my second favorite character in the entire show. my favorite Sheldon and Amy scene is quite an underrated one. It's when Sheldon is trying to choose between a PS4 and Xbox One. He's explaining it to Amy but she obviously doesn't care. She asks Sheldon for the butter but he believes she is not taking it seriously enough. So Amy acts like she cares which leads to a hilarious scene where Sheldon tells her about the pros and cons of XBOX and PS4. When Amy acts like she really cares about it Sheldon gets more and more enthusiastic scene. This builds up to Sheldon asking her what to do and her screaming 'PLEASE PASS THE BUTTER!!!' Another amazing Sheldon and Amy bit is the tiara scene. However, i have to admit it's much better the first time watching. The unpredictability of it and the big reveal make it so great and is the best Amy moment in the show. However, this still isn't my favorite relationship. My favorite is Sheldon and Penny. The relationship shouldn't really work at first. Penny is a dumb blonde from Nebraska and Sheldon is an ignorant genius. But yet it does. They get along so well and have such a great relationship. Some of the scenes they share together like on Sheldon's birthday and when she breaks her shoulder. However, their best scene and the greatest scene in the entire show is the Leonard Nimoy scene. Jim Parsons does some of the greatest comedic acting ever. Let's just quote 'I now possess the DNA of Leonard Nimoy!!!'
So we've talked about the entire show and all the main characters, let's talk about the finale. They really went out with a bang! From Leonard slapping Sheldon to his touching speech at the end it was perfect and satisfactory. The best sitcom ending of all time. Much better than Friends (don't @ me.) So yeah, i've talked about it too much now. Thank you Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady for this amazing show. Oh and also thanks for fixing that damn elevator. And one more time. "The whole universe was in a......<br/><br/>Bazinga! Amazing writers and actors with enormous sense for comedy. Its just a fun wonderful series ...it make me laugh always I have watched this serie since the first day and was my favourite off all time. The characters personalities describes how technology and new way to live turned some of us in fanboys. Sheldon is one of my top 3 characters of TV shows. I will always remember this serie as the best I ever watched, and I think some of these character will remain iconic in memes and fan art. Bazinga! Penny (Kaley Cuoco) moves in next door to awkward nerds Sheldon Cooper (Jim Parsons) and Leonard Hofstadter (Johnny Galecki). The boys work at the university with fellow scientists Howard Wolowitz (Simon Helberg) and Raj Koothrappali (Kunal Nayyar). Aspiring actress Penny works as a Cheesecake Factory waitress along with Bernadette (Melissa Rauch). In the third season, Sheldon goes on a blind date with Amy Farrah Fowler (Mayim Bialik).<br/><br/>Chuck Lorre must be a gagillionaire by now after creating so many successful network sitcoms. There seems to be two main arguments for the show's detractors. It's either the nerds are not real people or that Lorre is a sitcom hack cultivating the lowest denominator of network TV. There is truth to both and it doesn't matter. The truth of the characters and the nerd culture is that it's a cartoon but that's network TV. Urkel is a TV icon but he's not a real person. Sure, these are broad characters but Chuck does add depth to most of them... except Raj. They are enjoyable and loveable... except Raj. There is a continuity problem with a character like Sheldon who gets modified over time. Everybody gets a bit of modification. In fact, Raj needed to modify his mute problem a lot earlier. It's tradition that minor characters can disappear without a trace. Minor history does not have to match up. None of it is anything different from most of the TV greats. As for nerd culture, this has the positive of digging into the boys' work. They are nerds because they love the stuff. They are science geeks. Maybe they talk too much about comics and not enough about important cultural and political ideas. That's not this show.<br/><br/>As for Lorre being a hack going low brow, it's not so low brow that it's badly written. It is better than 90% of network TV. As for repeating himself or repeating others, I simply quote another Barenaked Ladies song, "It's All Been Done b-e-f-o-r-e." There are similar misunderstandings or arguments or love interests as other iconic shows from before. It does follow the sitcom formula. It's not a show pushing any boundaries. There are catch phrases. It has its own Urkel. I don't look down on that. Most of the problematic writing comes with Raj. He could have been rehabilitated with Lucy. I love Kate Micucci and she could be another Mayim Bialik. The biggest differentiator between a good show and a bad one is usually how much the audience likes the leads. In this case, the fans love these characters. I'm also giving this show an extra point for being a successful show for twelve seasons. In our modern fragmented world, this show stands atop of all the network sitcoms. But before talking about series, some words about reviews here - already appeared about 10 after ending, and basically did not say anything new, not even those who say that show did not offer anything new after first 4-5 seasons :-)<br/><br/>Surely not for everyone, but those giving ratings 1-2 really look as just want to differ from majority here. Some saying that was no character development, but that is not true. Surely, not some realistic character development is what happened, but this is comedy. Complains about poor science level - same.<br/><br/>About that this show took a lot from others - 'Friends' was mentioned probably most time, and surely there are similarities. I watched it entirely in previous year (and more than half of it for the first time). It had same problem after few seasons - lack of new ideas and a bit forced humor, and that was in my opinion worse than in case of TBBT. I watched other long running comedy series too recently - The King of Queens - and guess what, I could list here at least dozen of things what TBBT 'took' from there. Like all those knocking less fast enterings - but I'm sure that it was present before TKOQ too somewhere ...<br/><br/>Lot of complains was about main female characters appearing at season 3, which became wives more-less later. Namely Bernadette and Amy . I'm pretty sure that main reason by most for not liking was their look. I was thinking before why authors did not go on some more attractive partners. And there were actually - Novitzky, Emily ... This can be considered as brave move, and making all it more realistic. Of course, lot of sits and jokes were done related with their not so attractive looks. especially in case of Amy .<br/><br/>This is considered as best 'nerd' series, and that may be true, especially as there is not much of it. Actually, I know only Freaks and Geeks, what was great, some of actors became famous and regular mainstream movie actors, but it was only 1 season. And that leads us to IMDB ratings. Spotted on some list of top rated series, and what the Hell, TBBT is not even in top 250 ??? Surely, authors should blame self - why they did not finish it after season 3, when rating was much higher ? :-)<br/><br/>I give it 9 after watching it all, and I started it only 2 years ago - when I saw title, I thought that this is some 'scientistic' show about space, time etc. And I really don't like them, especially not those on commercial channels. Not to mention that all this is flawed science. Big Bang - big words, while basic, fundamental things are not clarified - time in first place. Sorry, back to series:<br/><br/>I think that it gave something new, not too much, but that's is what makes it popular and understandable for most viewers. Was for sure most watched for some time, they made big money with it. Final 2, in same day aired episodes were fine for end. Surely, it was pretty much predictable, but ending speech was performed, directed really great. Jim Parsons needed not to act too much - I see it as some farewell from team, viewers too. And level of jokes was high too.<br/><br/>Nice work folks. Hope that not so young Chuck Lorre still has something in his sleeves. in compare with friends, how i met your mother, joey or ... it's not bad, although it's not like them at all but it can amuse you sometime. the thing is, what's up with this Sheldon!!! he thinks he is so funny but i have to say he is such boring and pain in the ass. i like the other cast especially Raj!!! but this sick Sheldon. at first it was good, but little by little it got worst. when there is Leonard why they gave Sheldon more dialogue! oh god, i wish there was no such thing in this series. i hope some day all of them kick his ass and throw him out of the apartment then there will be no Sheldon. he ruins this TV series and now i must say i just wasted my time and money just because of him :( This look at the adventures of some geeks is sure to appeal to a wide swath of people. I in particular identify the most with Sheldon's social awkwardness - and sometimes his lack of understanding of irony and sarcasm - but every character has his/her merits. Howard's constant suffering at the hands of his mother is enough to cause schadenfreude. Watching "The Big Bang Theory" has taught me a lot of "Star Trek" and gaming trivia, and has made it a lot easier to understand some of the obscure physics facts. It's a really fun show, all the while poking fun at some stereotypes (the motivated Indian, the nice Jewish boy, and the woman who's always the voice of reason).<br/><br/>So watch it. I think that you'll like it. I will fully admit that I am more of a film person than a television person. Part of that has to do with the opportunity cost of watching increasingly numerous half hour segments versus a one-time 2 hour commitment. The other part is that they are often of significantly poorer quality than their stand-alone brethren.<br/><br/>"The Big Bang Theory," however, is a hilariously nerdy delight. Sheldon's shockingly anti-social antics and Leonard's (often failed) attempts at normal social interaction drive the entire series from episode to episode. Howard and Raj round out the comic relief while Penny provides a much-needed dose of normality to the show. The jokes are smart, yet extremely accessible and the situations, given the character's high IQ's and poor social skills, are entirely believable. Even some of the more outlandish sequences (such as when Leonard dreams of Sheldon reproducing through mitosis after ingesting a substantial amount of Thai food) never stray too far from ordinary so as to be enjoyable.<br/><br/>It also warrants mentioning that the show features the best title sequence (complete with a "Barenaked Ladies" original song) is likely the most singularly excellent one I've yet seen for a television series. The catchy song, complete with accompanying visuals, tells the history of the Universe (and especially that of mankind) within a 30 second run-time (which I think stands as a pretty impressive feet).<br/><br/>Ultimately, the show comes off as a nerdier and more smartly written version of Seinfeld or friends. Fans of those shows (or sit coms in general), nerd culture (comic books, sci-fi, fantasy, ren' fairs and conventions) and science (especially physics) will find this show a hilarious and enjoyable. Leonard, Sheldon, Wolowitz and Raj are highly intelligent scientists with Degrees, Masters and PHD's to their name...however, they are hopeless when it comes to social interaction...that's until the beautiful Penny moves in, next to Leonard and Sheldon....<br/><br/>I, can remember watching the pilot and thinking this is not funny....But recently I gave this show a go...and I have to say, it's grown on me... In my opinion, you have to watch a season to really get into the show and begin to delve into the show's 'different' comedic elements...Like Sheldon's obsessive behaviour, Wolowitz's every word and Raj's facial expressions.<br/><br/>As a British South Asian, I find it inspiring that their is a Asian character who is not the laughing stock of the show...I love Wolowitz the most, his shocking behaviour among the ladies....<br/><br/>And as a life long fan of comics and sci-fi...I understand the comic book jokes perfectly. Remarkably bad show. <br/><br/>There is no actual humour here, just laugh tracks which make things seem funny. The main characters are obnoxious. The show exudes sexism and misogyny, well hidden by the socially awkward, unconventional characterisation of Leonard, Sheldon, Rajesh and Howard. And while the show seems to glorify the "nerd subculture" ever-present in every scene, it rather mocks it as the people involved with it are dorky, insecure, socially awkward men who don't fall into the convention of so called "real men".<br/><br/>The message this show is sending is sexual harassment and misogyny are okay and harmless, and men who don't fall into the "real, macho man" stereotype are to be mocked. Don't watch this show. Every episode seems to be the same after season 4 I got bored. Sheldon does something that offends the others and then learns why what he did was wrong I used to watch this show a bit, but stopped because I completely lost interest. I look back and realise how embarassing this show actually is... Most of the characters always obsess over sex, and they like to constantly make fun of geek culture and they also stereotype pop culture geeks, as I am one of those nerds, have been since I was little. This show is just stupid and cringey... Has not been worth anybody's time for over ten years... This show is just awkward and embarassing in so many ways... All in the family is my favorite comedy TV series. Seeing many seasons of TBBT made me think of All in the Family recently...<br/><br/>Except TBBT is focused more on innovation and non-racism.<br/><br/>The acting is great; especially all the comedy involved is sure well done.<br/><br/>The choice of actors for each character is remarkable.<br/><br/>Storyline from first season till now is excellently built.<br/><br/>Everything relating with the show to modern science is absolutely fascinating. However only thing made me knock off 1 point from giving this show a 10 is the fact that Sheldon should have acting more "straight" with his sexual orientation in the show despite the fact that he is a homosexual in real life.<br/><br/>Other than that, it's truly a funny show! I would like to start by saying that I am not generally a fan of American sitcoms, for me their has not been a good one since Friends. I did not watch The Big Bang Theory from the moment it was released back in 2007, Around 2010 was the first time I tuned in, learning that the show was created by Chuck Lorre, who released the god awful and highly over-rated Two And A Half Men, didn't fill me with much hope. I don't recall which exact episode I watched first, but I do remember laughing my behind off, the writing at times is so intelligent yet simple which lures in such a wide audience. As far as the characters go Leonard is the main man in the group coping with his stereotypical geeky job while trying to apply himself to 'social conventions' he is only the main character in theory not practice, if you ask any one who has seen the show they will immediately reference Sheldon, played by the extremely talented Jim Parsons, who I was surprised to discover has no real history of acting besides this show, everything about his performance be it the delivery or the execution is top notch, I hope to see him in other projects in the future. Raj and Howard initially take on the role of dumb and dumber, both attempt to fulfill their need for a relationship in unique ways whether it's Raj's inability to talk to women or Howard's creepy personality. Finally Penny whom is the most one dimensional of all the characters regardless we still love her for it and Kaley Cuoco plays the dumb blonde very well, despite the obvious differences between her character and the lads both gel extremely well. All the side characters are quirky and unique, branching from the mischievous lisp suffering work colleague Kripky or Howard's awful New York inspired mother. Overall The Big Bang Theory is a shining beacon in a polluted modern TV schedule featuring 'masterpieces' such as The Only Way Is Essex and Jersey Shore. I have loved this very funny show from the very beginning and by now have seen many of the episodes three times and still laugh at the same situations and jokes I've seen before.<br/><br/>After 4 1/2 years what I still don't get is why Sheldon and Leonard with doctorates and good jobs at a university are so financially strapped that they have to share a modest apartment with a broken elevator in Pasadena.<br/><br/>And what about Raj and Howard? Raj is from a wealthy family and has a doctorate and a good job but lives in a small apartment. Howard has a masters degree in engineering and is gainfully employed but he is even worse off. Howard still lives at home with his loud, cranky mother and drives a motor scooter instead of a car.<br/><br/>All four girls in the sitcom seem to be doing much better. Penny - the minimum wage waitress - has her own apartment in the same building as the boys. Amy, Leslie and Bernadette each has her own place.<br/><br/>So what are the boys doing with all their money? I was searching for another TV series to watch and a friend of mine recommended me to follow TBBT. I was skeptic because, as far as I was told, the show was about some geeks going there, doing science stuff and blah blah. Nevertheless, I gave it a shot... and that was all I needed to go on and watch it week after week.<br/><br/>The jokes are very well written and the actors play the show exemplary. In fact, if you watch the show, it blends science and nerdy stuff with basic human needs (Leonard wanting to make "coitus" with Penny) in a hilarious way. The texts are more than you want and the situations presented can really exist (I know for a fact that guys like Sheldon do exist).<br/><br/>As far as the characters go, Sheldon (Jim Parsons) does a great job to maintain the focus of the show around him with his odd behavior, strange rules and arrogant showoffs, Leonard is stuck between normality and nerd-ism, having the role of explaining Sheldon's actions, Raj and Howard are the sidekicks and Penny is just at the wrong time at the wrong place.<br/><br/>To understand better all this jibber-jabber, stop reading reviews and watch the show. It is comedy as it was meant to be! ==(The spoilers that are in this are from the first two episodes)==<br/><br/>This is my all time favorite show! I started watching it a week ago, from season 1, and now am at season 9! It is AMAZING! I didn't have favorite actor before I started watching it, now I do - Jim Parsons. It has some really nerdy jokes, and some that I think everyone will get. I am 13, and I understand 90% of them. Ph.D & a lot more titles - Sheldon Cooper's a real big & tall nerd, and his roommate - Leonard Hofstader - short and nerdy, but not nerdier than Shelly. A girl called Penny, working in a cheesecake restaurant, moves in in the apartment next to Leonard & Sheldon. She teaches them how to not be awkward (mostly that weirdo Sheldon), and every episode is better than the last one. Must watch it! I really, really tried to be fair to the show, but all I could muster up was a 4/10. Most of my friends watch this show, so it was hard for me not to have seen an episode or two. This. Show. Is. Abysmal. I'm not going to be biased, I'll try to give my reasons for why this show sucks.<br/><br/>Firstly, the characters. Even by the newest season (At the time of this review season 6), I didn't give a crap about what happened to them. BBT has little to no character development but it's not like it matters as you won't care for them any who. You've got the nerd with the crush, the genius nerd, the nerd still living with his mother, and the nerd who can't talk to girl's. The characters are so stereotypical and generic that they don't stand out at all. As for the actors, with the exception of Jim Parson, the rest of the lot could be played by any one else and it would make no difference. I'm not even going to mention the girl across the hall; let's just leave it that if she was played by any other hot, blonde, big breasted girl, no one would even notice.<br/><br/>The story also sucks. I decided to conduct a little experiment, and watched the show in a random order of seasons, jumping from season 5, to season 3, to season 6, to 4, to 2, and finally to 1. Not only that, I watched them in a random order of episodes as well. And you know what I found? IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE. The story is so drawn out and shallow, that it doesn't matter what order you watch this pathetic "TV show" in, it'll make no difference whatso ever. The repeated use of the same nerdy jokes, inappropriate and racial humor can only help the show, and yet that's what the god awful writers seem to keep spewing out. It's the same, rinse and repeat formula, and by the 6th season it's worse than torture to watch it. Even by the 3rd season(and I'm being lenient), you'll barely chuckle during an episode, and for a show that so heavily relies on humor, that's not good. The small amounts of romance they try to add in the show to mix it up a bit would work, BUT THE CHARACTERS ARE BORING,GENERIC, AND FORGETTABLE. This show degrades the good name of nerds. I know I'm in the minority of the hundreds of BBT fans, but I'm not being biased or hateful, I'm just treating this as I would any other TV or movie I was reviewing, and I can't help it if the show is truly appalling.<br/><br/>My final verdict is that the show is forgettable, boring, and dry. People seem to have forgotten the definition of a good comedy TV show (Friends, Seinfeld), and now applaud anything that makes them laugh. The comedy in the show isn't even real comedy( my definition of good comedy is witty or ironic, something that doesn't rely on rude jokes, like most of today's TV series), just inappropriate and nerdy which will soon drag on like nails on a chalk board. The characters, story, and any hopes at a romantic element are a failure in the show. The only people that find the show enjoyable are the current teenage population, for whom the show is perfectly dumb and stupid enough for. I'm generally pretty generous, and this is the lowest rating I've given, but I stick to what I say, when I tell you that the Big Bang Theory is a television failure and disaster in almost every single manner. 4/10 stars. One of the stupidest show's ever made. How can this series still be around? Who even watches network tv anymore? Pathetic. TBBT is not a great show, it's actually silly and ridiculous, they stick to the idea that being a physicist is being perfectionist, dumb, extremely shy or naive. The characters are like 25 years old and they act like kids, they don't seem to understand social rules or even behave like normal non-nerd people. The topics and motivations on the series are stupid too; most times about sex and romance (the "funny" part is that the "nerds" don't know much about that... not funny at all in my opinion).<br/><br/>The show is not greatly intelligent; the star of the show is Sheldon, an "intelligent" guy whose only intelligent attributes consists in quoting theories and indicating paradoxes or logical failures of his partners. It seems his personality works to impress people by making them think "Wow, if I'd be intelligent, I'd be able to make people shut up by winning the discussions and saying bazzinga in the end". Kinda banal, in my opinion. But it works for people who watch the show and think "yeah, that's me, I'm that socially awkward and potentially intelligent and sarcastic".<br/><br/>Come on, this is not an intelligent show; my redneck sister-in-law loves the show because its sense of humour is actually kiddish, even those intrincate "quantum-theories" often referred by some characters. OK, it sometimes adds some good-thought jokes about science, but they're not the core of the series; the plots are more like "wow, Raj has to date a girl and he's femophobe, let's make fun of it". Come on, there's no more people like that; physicists are cultivated, clever people, not buffoons like in this series.<br/><br/>This show works for people who don't want to think much, it's a teenager show; maybe if was back to my 12's I'd love the show, but for an adult person it's a ridiculous program, not really worth to watch. The characters on this show are very good. Two two main characters (forgot their names) are funny and likable, especially the banter between them. And the Indian and Jewish guys are funny too (sorry can't remember anyones names). A lot of the minutia in the scripts are also good. I know they're scientifically accurate and all that. The main weakness is the plots of the episodes. Not very interesting. In one episode one of the main characters loses his job cause he insults his boss, then his mother (an annoying, stereotypical Jesus freak) comes and makes him get it back. Eh. In another episode, the other main character gets a kind of date with the girl and it goes okay. The plots are rather pedestrian but hopefully it will improve in the future. It has a lot of potential. For example Seinfeld didn't really get good until the 3rd season. Same with South Park. So I'm optimistic. BBT is the best show which i have ever watched !! Started watching it in my college days still it goes on ! No one who start watching would hate it ! In fact , It is like an addiction ! I have repeatedly watched so many times each episodes and i still love to watch it again ! It is a show with different, crazy but lovable set of people and their relationships. No wonder it has great number of viewers worldwide ! If i were in California, I would have visited the set for sure. The Characterization of Jim(Sheldon) is brilliant! He steals the show most of the time and i am a huge fan! His 'Bazinga' would never get old ! Kaley(Penny) rocks in her role and always love her character! It has Sci-fi, fantasy, comic book fandom , gaming and everything so it definitely a must watch series i would say ! And Now the Season 8 has started, so i am super excited to see new episodes ! Happy that CBS has renewed the contract of Big Bang Theory till Season 10 that will be up to 2017! So its really gonna rock! So, What are you waiting for. Just Go and enjoy the show by watch with your friends ! :) Simply the best comedy show on TV. There are not many TV shows which keep you hooked the way this one has done. Once I started watching I just could not stop. Three seasons had been aired at that time so I watched all three consecutively. After that I have been watching all the episodes as soon as they are aired. The comedy is just superb and the characters are simply great. One can not watch this without becoming a fan of 'Sheldon Cooper'. The one really admirable thing about this show is that it has not lost it's touch even in it's current seventh season. The jokes remain as fresh as if this show just started. Portraying the lives of Geeks has been done with such detail that one really feels as if the actors are really what their characters are depicting. All in all this is just the perfect comedy show you will ever find. I strive to become a critic that tells the truth, not what others are saying and i just go along with it!<br/><br/>The Big Bang Theory is one of the best TV shows if not the best ever made.<br/><br/>The Big Bang Theory appeared just as I began to look around for shows to watch as i really had worn my friends seasons out :). I was delighted to find a proper studio-based sit com with a modern look and loads of potential. The show had a real flavor of Frasier about it. Whereas Frasier and Nile's would talk about the opera, theater and literature, Sheldon and Leonard would talk Star Wars, Star Trek and Marvel Comics which is exactly what i am into and talk about myself so if there was to ever be a show that i could create just for myself then Big Bang would be it!. "Most viewers would more instantly see the similarities to Two and a Half Men" is a comment i had seen at the time but I feel although Two and a Half Men was a huge huge hit and enjoyable at times to watch, the Big Bang is in a league of its own compared to it, the writers directions and the actors sheer class made this sitcom, the actors in Big Bang do that good of a job it would take a lot to convince the really skeptical viewer that in fact they are not like how they are in the show in real life, that's how amazing they do there roles and to keep the same outstanding performances each week each season is really a testament to how amazing the producer is for this sitcom.<br/><br/>My only negative review would be The elevation of Sheldon, essentially, leading man status is understandable given Jim Parsons' wonderful performance. However Sheldon remains a deeply selfish character and the writers have never found a satisfying way to balance the negative aspects of his character with his dominant role in the show. The comedy is often predictable but is enlivened greatly by the actors' ability to perform in front of a responsive crowd.<br/><br/>The Big Bang Theory is one of the most outstanding amazing dream catching shows i have ever seen and i cant see how anything again will come close to what they have done and are continuing to do, for this reason i will rate The Big Bang Theory a outstanding 10 out of 10. which i never do because i don't believe in pure perfection but this show really is the closest to perfect you can get for TV in my opinion, remember these are only my opinions not what i think everyone should feel.<br/><br/>Thanks for taking the time to read my review and please follow my reviews when you see them as i will give you an accurate review before you venture into the unknown and watching it yourself.<br/><br/>Goodbye, Au revoir, Tōfā Soifua, Adios, Giga-Waabamin, Sayonara, Ming-Longz oc, zai lian, Yawo, Usale Kahle. I used to like the BBT until Chuck Lorre's loathing of anything Jewish became frighteningly apparent. I normally would not care that some worthless Hollywood reptile built a character, Wolowitz, who so deeply and completely holds his Jewishness in total contempt, so be it. But the BBT is immensely popular, even among most secular Jews, that I feel that I have to object to how Lorre portrays Jews and Judaism in his show. So Wolowitz eats non kosher food regularly, seems to see lox and bagels as a Jewish ritual, and holds kosher food as a bad joke. Then wonder of wonders, Lorre has Wolowitz marry a gentile girl, a super shikseh in fact, a Polish Catholic girl, in total violation of every basic Jewish Law, period! But the crowning insult to Yiddishkeit, the cremation of Wolowitz's mother, took the cake. Cremation is absolutely, totally, and unforgivably forbidden by Jewish Law, Halacha, and it is even forbidden by Jewish Law for a relative to obey any instructions to cremate a Jew, ever. Indeed, the soul of the Jew cremated, his or her Neshoma or Jewish Soul, cannot enter Paradise, ever. I asked my wife what possesses Chuck Lorre and why he despises his own Jewish Faith so deeply and bitterly, and she was just as confused as I am. Again, I would not mind, but Lorre is insulting Judaism and the Jewish People far too much, and the cremation thing is the worst. Chuck, if you read this, please give your attacks on Judaism a rest, and get better writers, the eighth season was not funny, indeed, I saw no humor in Sheldon stealing Leonard's limelight, indeed, I saw it as a professional and personal betrayal of the highest order and not at all funny, just like the rest of the season! The show is extremely sad. Kayley I remember most from "8 simple rules" which soon after broadcast suffered a terrible death, but she and the show moved on well.<br/><br/>However, "Big bang" just seems to over stretch the concept of nerds who meet an attractive ditsy woman. The idea isn't horrible, but the execution is kind of annoying, they keep stressing that the guys are all nerds, wear briefs, glasses, and of course, must have names such as Sheldon and Leonerd. Because no self respecting physicist living in an apartment building won't call him self Lenny...<br/><br/>The show is watchable, but boring. sitcoms however are very known to usually have a shaky first episode for the most part, if things don't improve over the next few episodes, this show might be doomed to only bee seen by people who actually use the products the characters use (AKA video games, indoor marker boards and star wars shampoo).<br/><br/>If they are lucky enough to tone the show down just a bit, into regular level nerds (because what they made is borderline mega nerds), the show will actually be nice.<br/><br/>And I don't see why wherever Kayley goes, she needs to act stupid, she may have some...very prominent physical features, but that shouldn't lead her into these casual, Jessica Simpson level roles. This is an amazing show where they show off about their cool achievements they have earned in their life, the nerds get to meet other people and see the world and this show gives the excitement even from the first episode itself. When ever i am out of mood and need relaxation, this is the best show which i watch. Actors are really amazing and they withhold their role so fabulously, they give liveliness to their character.. I wish i could meet them one day and i wish this show goes on even more Seasons.. I request you not to stop this show. This is amazing Comedy and romantic and nerdy show and they give lot of information about science and stuff, its even a best way to share the knowledge as well and this is even one of the best work and the researches you guys have went through.., Good work and well done whole team and this my Favorite show of all time.<br/><br/>Everyone can understand this if they watch one or two times. Best show and good work guys.. "The Big Bang Theory" - Now here is a show for the true nerd in all of us, finally.<br/><br/>Now, here is some pretty simple math for you to think about: Nerds + hot girls = Something uniquely funny and special?<br/><br/>Got the answer? Good. Now, moving on...<br/><br/>"The Big Bang Theory" is a sitcom that I've slowly edged myself into gradually. It's a great show. I feel bad now for having waited for so long to watch it. It's a show made by well-known comedic producers (Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady), for all the nerds out there. As a nerdy guy myself, I feel that "The Big Bang Theory" was made for me, and other people like me.<br/><br/>But I've long been weary about "The Big Bang Theory" and other so-called "nerd"/"geek" television shows. I realize that it's all the rage nowadays to embrace all the "uncool" stuff that's been so long derided by the mainstream for years, and so I thought that "The Big Bang Theory" was an empty attempt to try to cash in hard on sacred nerd culture.<br/><br/>But alas, while the show contains references from everything up to & including well-known scientific theories and principles to "Star Wars" to "The Lord of the Rings" to the Green Lantern, none of the characters are stereotyped and are written with care and affection and it clearly shows in the carefully scripted material. And with all the nerd-culture references, there's clearly enough here to satisfy all the nerds and non-nerds alike out there.<br/><br/>The show centers around best friends and L.A. physicists Leonard Hofstadter (Johnny Galecki) and Sheldon Cooper (Jim Parsons), who both have a fundamental understanding about everything from the "inescapable pull of a black hole to the intricate structure of the atom." But while they both have great minds and they know how to use them, their social ineptitude is heightened to astronomical proportions when beautiful Nebraska native Penny (beautiful Kaley Cuoco - sorry, blondes just don't do it for me, so I have to fake it here) moves into the apartment across the hall from theirs. While Penny may not possess Leonard or Sheldon's high aptitude in all things related to science, she has common sense and knows how the real world works. Hilarity ensues as brains clashes with beauty...<br/><br/>Much of the humor arises from the various absurd situations that the characters find themselves in, such as Leonard and Sheldon trying to fit in with Penny (especially Leonard trying to fit in with Penny, and their awkward stares provide the show's requisite tentative romantic drama), and Penny trying to fit in with them. Additional players include Leonard and Sheldon's colleagues - the annoying wanna-be ladies man Howard Wolowitz (Simon Helberg) and Indian-American selective mute Raj Koothrappali (Kunal Nayyar) - who both provide additional humor. "Roseanne" Sara Gilbert also shows up from time to time as their equally bookish female co-worker Leslie Winkle.<br/><br/>"The Big Bang Theory" is a brilliant show. It's much more brilliant and entertaining than I anticipated it would be. Watch it. Love it. And maybe try to learn something nerdy from it.<br/><br/>10/10 Leonard Hofstadter and Sheldon Cooper are both brilliant physicists. They are working at Cal Tech in Pasadena, California.They are best friend.They are also friends with their Cal Tech colleagues mechanical engineer Howard Wolowitz and astrophysicist Rajesh Koothrappali.The foursome spend their time working on their individual work projects, playing video games, watching science-fiction movies, or reading comic books.A woman moves into an apartment.Her name is Penny.Penny who aspiring an actress,a pretty woman.Then Penny will be Leonard's girlfriend.It will be very amazing.I think you should watch it.It's good to see something worth watching!Give it a shot!! First time i am writing this, i use to love this show, but now for me there are way too many characters in this show, and most of them(new once)don't have good comic timing or characters. Only thing holding the show is Sheldon Character, plus now they portraying Raj character so people have some sympathy for him but all it making people irritating and i am praying at least they turn him gay so he doesn't look this much irritating, poor Leoanrd is only there to support Sheldon character. Now they are giving a lot of importance to Howard character, but i found him more funny when he was with other guys, now he only seems with Bernadette which quite frankly is not of a funny character to see, and Melissa Rauch fails in her comic timing. For me this show was working when there were few characters. Shows like Friends, Community and others have few characters, and if there are many characters like Community then those characters are strong and brilliant in acting those scene. Sorry to say but Big Bang theory has lost its plot. This show centers around four men, Sheldon, Leonard, Howard and Raj, who are socially inept yet want to be accepted. Sheldon, Leonard and Raj have doctorates, and Howard is in the process of earning his doctorate. All four became a group after Leonard moved into Sheldon's apartment; Raj and Howard are Leonard's friends. Sheldon is the dominant member of the group. This is the case because Sheldon is the only one who has his own apartment. Raj lives with his sister and Howard with his mother. Hence, they meet at Sheldon's apartment where Leonard lives. Sheldon uses the fact that they are meeting at his apartment to maintain control over the group. i.e., where they can sit, who can stay, what they can watch on television, what foods they can eat, what games they can play, etc. The other three tolerate this because they have no other choice except to leave, and they have no place else to go. When things get really stressful for Sheldon, such as when one of the members of the group start complaining about something Sheldon did or said, Sheldon relies on biting sarcasm couched in hyper-intellectual language to force the complainant back into his place. It's a form of intellectual muscle-flexing meant to intimidate. These interactions are a source of much of the show's humor. Often, Sheldon's intellectualism becomes so extreme that it becomes incomprehensible and soon degenerates into gibberish. Sheldon also has disdain for the others wanting to meet women, but as one follows the series it becomes apparent that he's interested in women too. However, his obsessive compulsiveness has distorted his social skills, thus he cannot relax enough to establish an emotional bond and comes off as being distant and aloof when in fact he is actually caring. Without Sheldon there's be no show, at least not in its present form. The other three characters need Sheldon and Sheldon needs them. That all four are functioning at a similar intellectual level facilitates the verbal give-and-take that goes on within the group. Put Sheldon in with another group, he is immediately written off as a crank. But with Leonard, Raj, and Howard, Sheldon has an audience, albeit a captive one. What makes the show succeed is the way it catches the intensity of the interactions between the four as each is vying to show up the others. Although they've formed a group, they're not really friends. They are more like travelers stuck on the same ship who by mere circumstance are stuck with other. The closest thing to a friendship on the show is that between Sheldon and Leonard. Leonard is the only one that Sheldon respects, and when Leonard is upset, Sheldon, in his own distorted way, will try to help. Of the four, Leonard is the most substantive character. While Raj and Howard are buffoons who provide comic relief, Leonard is more serious and more emotionally developed. Hence, Leonard is able to form relationships with women, such as with Penny, the girl next door, and with Raj's sister, and is able to maintain his emotional equilibrium when the others are acting out. When Leonard is sad it is for a good reason, and when he is happy it is for a good reason too. Thus, he serves as the straight man for the other three, which makes him, in a way, the most entertaining and satisfying character of the four. The Big Bang Theory, I love this theory its awesome!<br/><br/>Penny why are you are so pretty don't cut the hair please !<br/><br/>Leonard you have penny and Sheldon!<br/><br/>Sheldon you have your special spot take care of it!<br/><br/>Raj "Wolowitz you sucks " wow thats called 'friends'and you are from India!<br/><br/>Howard you are an astronaut everyone knows it! <br/><br/>Bernadette you have special voice wow!<br/><br/>Amy Sheldon loves you!<br/><br/>Well you guys are doing great thanks to all of you who belongs to this theory and thanks for your contributions for make us laugh and provides motivation towards interest in science,joy,friendship,love,life and i believes that never stops ! ! i am belongs to India ! Canned laughter telling you when to laugh. Really, in the 21st century. Never could watch this horrid show. SPOILERS AHEAD !<br/><br/>Before I discovered TBBT, I watched The Simpsons, zealously. IIRC, I got onto TBBT as a result of episode 6.15, in which Sheldon spoils the last 2 Harry Potter books for Leonard. Four years later, I'm still watching TBBT.<br/><br/>This, unlike some US comedy series, is one that has crossed the Pond well. It could not possibly be mistaken for anything but a US series - the many, many references to US culture guarantee that. In less competent hands, its strongly-defined identity would grate after a while. TBBT never wears out its welcome - the average episode is only 20 minutes long - so it never becomes stale or hackneyed. For a series 279 episodes long, that is no mean achievement. There may be some weak episodes, but if so, I've missed them: I cannot think of a single one that is not full of laughs - even without the laugh track.<br/><br/>The criticisms of TBBT note the difference in tone after the 4th series, when Sheldon gets a girl who is a friend. There is a difference, but not, I think, a deterioration. None of the 4 central characters is replaced, but all develop, in fresh and unforeseeable ways. The series is not a comedy of relationships alone - that aspect of it is deepened & developed, but it never stops being driven by ideas and situations as well. The recurring secondary characters - Stephen Hawking, Wil Wheaton, Barry Kripke, Sheldon's mother, Leonard's mother, Penny's father, to name a few - remain amusing because their comic potential is never exhausted; the comedy in them is milked to a certain point - & no further. This tactful handling of them ensures that there is always some depth in them from which further comedy can be drawn. Other characters are then brought on, allowing the departing characters to be forgotten for a while so that they can be re-introduced without having gone stale from over-use.<br/><br/>In The Simpsons, Bart is eternally a 10-year old, and Maggie never ages beyond young infancy. The characters are all static and fixed in time, because the comedy requires them to be: the lack of character development is needed for the comedy to work. The much-hated Skinner episode shook the story up a bit, by changing the formula - and was disliked as a result. The Simpsons has a sense of the past - it has to, for the episodes about the past lives of Krusty or Sideshow Bob or Mr Burns to work - but the characters are essentially changeless. The resultant predictability is what allows the viewer to settle back and expect a certain kind of humour, which is what the episodes serve up. (Hence, perhaps, the ritual character of the activity known as Watching The Simpsons.) As with TBBT, the humour in The Simpsons is most effective in smallish helpings: the film is long enough to lag now and again.<br/><br/>In TBBT, by contrast, there is a strong sense of the past. Not only does time pass, but the characters constantly show awareness of the past, and comment in detail upon it. Times change - and so do the characters. They are not static. All members of the main quartet have well-defined narrative arcs. Raj begins by being unable to speak to women. Once he is used to speaking to them, he develops his party animal tendencies. And after that, he gets a dog. And after that, he has trouble settling for a single girlfriend, while also having to navigate his parents' break-up.<br/><br/>Raj is more developed than Apu in The Simpsons - Apu is perfect for The Simpsons, because that series is not naturalistic, but a cartoon. The naturalistic medium of TBBT requires characters of greater depth and complexity, which results in giving us, not just Raj, but his relations, his dog, his family, and his associates. The Simpsons gives us Apu's wife & their many children & his brother - and that is it. This naturalism of the medium is, I think, why there is a shift in the tone of the series: as time passes, people change, so their relations to the world about them change. The past from which the characters come, has effects on what they are in the present, and moulds what they will be in the future. Cartoon characters can afford to be one-note characters, in a way that would be impossible in the everyday world. Krusty's relationship to his father shows him to be the same Krusty we are familiar with already - the lack of development of character is basic to the fun of the episode.<br/><br/>The narrative arc that shows us the relationship between Sheldon and Amy is humour of a very different kind. The form is that of a relationship comedy, but the spirit is that of TBBT. Without their relationship, there would be no clashes between Amy and Stuart, no tiara for Amy, no scenes of Amy trying on hideous dresses, no opportunity for Sheldon to be monumentally insensitive to his girlfriend, no Amy's parents, no Amy for Sheldon to cold-shoulder in favour of activities he finds more enjoyable, no Council of Ladies, no Amy for Penny and Bernardette to hurt without meaning to, no Amy to pick holes in Raiders of the Lost Ark, no Amy to write atrocious romantic fan-fics, no Girls' Night Out for Sheldon to invite himself to. For these reasons & others, Amy, or someone indistinguishable from her, is needed for the series to develop. Her presence does it a power of good. This show laughs at nerds instead of giving nerds something to laugh at. Instead of jokes, this show has meaningless references to things that nerds like, which apparently guarantees success. Such a mediocre show that didn't deserve to begin let alone exist for over a decade. Watched this show from the beginning. Sure there has been bad seasons, but it never betrayed the core characters of the show. Funny and full of nerdy pop culture. Sad to see it end but at least it didn't get cancelled or irrelevant over time. I would rate this 10 stars until now. The writers are killing this last season. It's not funny it's sad. Why bother doing it if you sabotage the best show ever. What do you have planned for the ending they split up? ThIs should have been the best of the best and win awards instead it's falling flat. Bazinga bozongiliod bongolion babaliod bruh bazaar bazingar bazingaring I love this show and I've loved it and have been a fan since episode one. I think it's funny how some of these posts say how they don't like the "laugh track" because If they knew as much as they thought they did they would know that TBBT is recorded in front of a live audience. So the laughs you here are genuine not the show trying to tell you when you should laugh. It's a great show period! From the actors portraying these halarious characters to the shows plotlines every episode it's just really fresh and a pleasure to watch! I think it's ironic when people try to say it's not funny at all and if you find it funny you don't know humor or that your dim witted when the show has stayed on the air for 12 years now and is only now ending because Jim Parsons wants to move on. In other words if you don't think this show is funny you are obviously the minority here. Long live TBBT! I dont think I ever laughed during the shows run, and we as tv viewers should be ashamed on how this lasted so long. The whole thing was just plain annoying. and to me nothing was good, the cast obviously clicked but for me it wasnt a good enough series to keep watching. What a coincidence... I just wrote the 300th user review on IMDb for "Two and a Half Men" and now I find I am writing review #500 for "The Big Bang Theory!" I feel very special and truly honored. Thank you IMDb and fellow users for making this possible...<br/><br/>Now for my review...<br/><br/>BE WARNED. "The Big Bang Theory" is NOT "Sliders"... It has in fact very little to do with "Sliders".<br/><br/>I had high hopes because the characters in this show practice science, including some very advanced stuff. I assumed that, since Jerry O'Connell was merely a high school student working on his own, obviously several college geniuses, who are experts in different scientific fields, must be able to unlock the mysteries of inter-dimensional travel. But NO.<br/><br/>Shame on the producers and writers of this show for making viewers believe it will be a great show like Sliders, only to have us find out when watching that it has zero sliding at all.<br/><br/>Sheldon is a huge wimp I can't respect at all. He's lucky he doesn't have to slide from one dimension to the next, where he is relied upon to solve an entire world's problems in a short period of time - because he would fold under the pressure, unlike Mr. O'Connell.<br/><br/>Leonard is also nothing compared to Professor Arturo either. He's just a nerd. Professor Arturo can FIGHT ROBOTS single handed while Leonard has trouble even building ONE robot over a period of years. He even has trouble just talking to girls. The Professor ruled an entire planet of women, with no sweat!<br/><br/>As for the other two nerds, they are nothing compared to the gorgeous Wade and The Crying Man. Seriously, do I even need to get into that one?<br/><br/>Also the characters in this show are thinly veiled racial and sexual stereotypes, and the jokes are predictable and written by hacks... so there's that too.<br/><br/>I give this show a 2, because it fails at being Sliders but at least there's some physics in it, which means there is at least the potential for future sliding... I am an ordinary Italian guy living in London for quite long time and all i wanted to say is that i usually i do not watch any kind of series although i tried to watch few of top rated by users funniest series but got disappointed about all of em after like a chapter... but since my gf showed me this one i really wanna say that all the actors and whoever made this serie they can be proud that a person which doesn t like to watch this kind of stuff thinks that this one is definitely the best thing he ever watched in his entire life and honestly there s not even comparation to all the other cause here we get real humour (and trust me as Italian i really love that), anything related to science is real which made this also interesting in the knowledge context. Best tv show i ever watched congratulations to everybody cause i really got impressed and i will always remember this tv show 4 ever !!! And last thing, perhaps quite few ppl said that after the 7th season is not worth to watch it i would like to say that i truly believe that is not easy to keep up a tv show like this mostly because in the beginning the whole cast gave their best and obviously either sooner or later is gonna happen (Like every single tv show, series exc......) that all the best and funniest jokes that they previously made they can t repeat them no longer... my point is, looking in this prospective they actually went really far 
 with new ideas which i think is really hard!!!! I will always support The Big Bang Theory as the best tv show i ever watched, i will always reccomend it to all (Although very few) ppl who never watched it. Kind Regards<br/><br/>Matteo This TV sitcom is probably the best sitcom running right now and I sincerely hope for it to just go on and on like the waves of the ocean. Well lemme just tell this: I got Seasons 1 to 10 of this TV show from my friend cause I had a heard a lot of praise about this series from my colleagues an even the internet. So one night I decided to start watching this show. SEASON 1 Episode 1: I thought it was just a 'nice' show and since I'm a part of the geek culture myself I thought of it as a good idea to continue watching TBBT. But boy, a few episodes into this show and I was completely hooked. At first, it increased from one episode per day to two episodes a day but it kept on increasing it was all getting relatable with Sheldon and Leonard cause they love physics and so do I. I mean it seemed as if I was a part of the show itself and I was also motivated a great deal for becoming a physicist( astrophysicist to be precise). Though the show had hilarious jokes, there is something one can learn about science from the jokes itself. I'm referring to the fun facts. In just one month, I've almost completed season 10 and will be starting season 11. So in a nutshell, this show means a whole lotta big deal to me and I see no rhyme or reason for considering this show as bad. Still, I respect everyone's point of view no matter how pointless they are! jk😐 A perfect show to me with awesome and hilarious science fiction references, superhero references and amazing jokes which make your encephalon into thought for a moment. Ain't I right! P.S. Please don't hate the show without watching it or simply because you don't understand the references! I hope this helps. I have been watching this show for as long as I can remember and I have loved it all I love Bernie and Sheldon Amy and lenard are great too I laugh out loud a lot at times during the show and truly enjoy the aspect of the whole nerds rule type thing but I do believe they need a fat nerd too lol .I am overweight myself and the show would be even funnier for me with a fat guy for a friend I could really relate lol. People would like to see Sheldon ending up with Penny instead of that Amy,she s more suitable for Leonard.I think they will be perfect for each other because Leonard, let's be serious he s just so boring and NOT FUNNY AT ALL and him and Amy don't have anything special they are just alright with what they have,you can't see an improvement of their characters they are just extra characters in this TV show.I hope you will consider my suggestion as something to think about ,because i think it will make your show more alive than it is now.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time and hopefully we ll see some interesting action in the future It really puzzles me how good sitcoms get cancelled and few people discover them later on.How big bang theory has gone on for 11 seasons yet it caters to the least common denominator is an even huger puzzle.<br/><br/>The characters were caricatures when it first began but now they are just items.The characters are misgonystic,lack any ounce of human decency and are really stilted .They are merely instruments for spouting insults and dumb jokes.<br/><br/>If you like sitcoms with real characters.Where the humor comes from characters and not laugh tracks,then please for the love of God find something else. Maybe i am just having my expectations set too high, but recently, i just don't see many (make it any) new TV shows that are worth watching and i don't think that this show is an exception, yet it has one foot set out of the straight line of unwatchable, dull wanna-be-comedy sitcoms, with some originality and distinctive, interesting characters, but when it comes to jokes, they are just hallow. Nevertheless, the Big Bang Theory, in my opinion, has some potential in it, so i'll keep an eye out for the next episode :) In the end i give the two current episodes 3 stars... that is just how many times it made me smile while watching it... Hello, this show airs in the Netherlands now for 10 seasons. But what i noticed, and correct me if i am wrong, is that after the top 3 actors, being Penny, Howard and of course Sheldon, negotiated a epic fee of 1 million dollar per episode the pressure on these 3 actors to perform and to be funny was proved to be too big. So the more money they got the less funnier the show got. And this continuous in the 11th season. I watched all episodes of the last 10 seasons. And for the first time i am thinking not to watch again. The scale is gliding towards embarrassment. So sad to see that the show didn't even get nominated at the last Emmy's. There are few shows that I can watch every single day without a break. The Big Bang Theory just happens to be one of them. I have the entire series (and load new ones with every new season) in a folder on my media hard drive and often just put it on play and let it run in the background while I'm doing other things. It is simply the funniest show on television.<br/><br/>I would say my favorite character on the show is Sheldon, as the Penny and Lennard improbability can get a little old at times. But, there are enough sub plots to keep you going, and the writing seems to be top notch.<br/><br/>It's interesting to see so many cast members from Rosanne. Seeing the very first episode will cause a bit not to watch it feeling. but after watching it for 1 season u will be thirsty for it. Do not compare it with other shows. it is unique and it can be very informative along with the humor in it.<br/><br/>this show is totally based on scientists lives though it may not be the exact thing with scientists in life but after watching this show we will assume it to be. and the rolls played are perfect. entire show is perfect.<br/><br/>This is a newer version of "friends" in which they show how friends hangout and in big bang theory they show how nerds live their life<br/><br/>its worth watching <br/><br/>it deserves 9/10 and its a bit informative too :) Big Bang theory is a comedy series rotating around science nerds and women in their lives. The series bring a lot to audience. Trends in entertainment do not change much, but being justified to the subject that comprises of your main theme element(science here) is difficult. It has been carved out beautifully with help of main characters that have been constructed. There is Sheldon, Rajesh, Leonard, Howard, Penny, Bernadette, Amy, Stuart and others. Each of them doing a superb job.<br/><br/>Jokes here do not come alone. They come along with scientific facts representing various areas of science. The conveyed nerd nature adds to the comedic theme.<br/><br/>Apart from that the introduction of various personalities like Stephen Hawking, Brian Greene, Professor Proton, etc in the series only adds to the fact that efforts are being made to attract more people towards science. Its nice to see how fun loving these people really are.<br/><br/>I recommend this series to every one, only if u don't hate comedy.<br/><br/>rating: 9.0/10 Saw S5E12 a while back, so take that as my timestamp.<br/><br/>The show is going down. It used to be an 'Intelligent fun' earlier, but now it seems like its more of a glorified FRIENDS.<br/><br/>I had read that they hired a science adviser for the show and the info and really witty jokes based on scientific facts used to shine more than the characters. Now they don't want to bring the stuff back. More like happy to keep milking the cash cow. Seems like they have fired that adviser (no offense if u still are working Mr Adviser, maybe writers just forgot the basic plot here. Ironic)<br/><br/>Anybody who has seen first 3 seasons, esp the first 2.. will understand the gist (third season was the best imo). Introduction and more focus on gfs, homely issues etc are really making it go down the road traveled by so many other shows. Characters other than the main cast should have been used to the point and in short bursts. Like Bernadett n Amy usually seen at work, or for 5 mins worth of outing scene's clip. Twice in a season seen on a proper date to satisfy the relationship mandates. PERIOD.<br/><br/>Maybe a bit like UK shows.., not laced with sugar syrup content the American sitcoms usually are. The Season 1 of BBT is a very good example.<br/><br/>Show needs a REBOOT. Stop the mushy relationships of howard going so fast. Marriage already ?? Next is what.. diapers??<br/><br/>I am aware this show has been renewed for 2 seasons, lets hope they don't keep sitting on their laurels and the show slowly starts to become bland and makes its patrons feel indifferent on Thursday nights. Spoiler, Spoiler, Spoiler, Spoiler!<br/><br/>Bazinga!<br/><br/>The Big Bang Theory is by far the best TV show ever to air on television. What concerns me though is when you look at the highest ratings in the TV section they have: A documentary called 'planet earth' as number one!<br/><br/>Not saying there's anything wrong with it but how is a documentary better then the Big Bang Theory. <br/><br/>The producers of Big Bang Theory have brought together some of the best actors of our generation were as this random documentary has David attenborough. Jim Parsons and Johnny Galecki are by far the funniest actors on TV were as David Attenborough is in my opinion the worst.<br/><br/>People need to start voting seriously because Planet Earth does not deserve a 9.6. My unbiased rating at best would be 7.6. Big Bang Theory even I know does not deserve 10 but that's what I have to do to get it up there where it should be. <br/><br/>Big Bang Theory needs to be in the 9's at least. All the actors on the Big Bang Theory set deserve proper recognition and at least a 9 rating will almost do just that.<br/><br/>So I would much appreciate it if people would rate it 10 to get it up there. The Big Bang Theory redefined my view of comedies. It's one of only a few shows that are a break from the derivative nonsense.<br/><br/>As of the writing of this review: IMDb Rating of 8.4 based on 490,563 users with 359 user reviews (including this one) & 107 critic reviews. The metrics speak for themselves & tell a truthful story.<br/><br/>I have seen the episodes several times. If my Father, Mother, or Son is watching it; I will sit down & watch it with them even though we've all seen it. It's still funny & better than most shows on TV; comedies or dramas.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it then watch a few episodes from each season. You'll catch a few that you like & then watch the rest. I can't separate one season being better than the other as I've seriously watched so many episodes.<br/><br/>It's a gre8 show. If you haven't seen it. Then you have a lot of fun moments to break up your week & it will put a spring in your step.<br/><br/>Thank you to Chuck Lorre, the cast, CBS, & the production team. I stopped watching around S4-5 I guess and I just watched the last episode for closure. Can't believe it went on 7 or 8 seasons since, it feels like I haven't missed anything. Just as I thought, Sheldon was oblivious up until the last 5 minutes and everything was same old same old. There was no character development at all. 0 character development.<br/><br/>To those who watch this show for sciency tidbits I want to say, obviously you'll learn a lot more about any given subject by reading a book or even an article. This show like any other is primarily for entertainment and character development is central to entertainment. If every character stays the same and they're totally predictable, where is the entertainment? The ending proved this show was ten fold more "safe" than I initially thought and I'm really glad I stopped wasting my time a long time ago .<br/><br/>( Holy cow I just found out upon reading more reviews that many have stopped watching around the same seasons, speaks for itself ) It's an amazing series I've watched them all I recommend it to the people that enjoy comedy and drama Ok I looked at some of the comments. Come on People in the Last 10 or 15 Years on T.V NOT to many Great T.V. Shows. THE BIG BANG THEORY is a Easy 10 out of 10. If you can't see the COMEDY. THEN you have a BRAIN PROBLEM. Come on Sheldon to take SO long to even KISS his GIRL LOL. RUB HER DOWN FOR PUNISHMENT, (but to her Oh ya) but he didn't CATCH ON. THEN HE WAS WAY MORE ROMANTIC THAN HE NEW IT. She played SICK to get touched and rubbed down Lol. There RELATIONSHIP was so Awesome IT was Great. When she was being INTO trouble and he was giving her a SPANKING LOL. She Loved it and he thought he was being Mr. BAD BOSS. 
This is One of the Best SHOWS MADE. funny and clever. interesting and exotic for its unusual script and art to escape by clichÃ©s. a great show who explores details and who remember the Gulliver adventures in contemporary society. the great virtue - smart use of measure who creates a fragile balance between humor am deep sympathy for lead heroes. than - admirable manner to present the innocence of few guys and the desire to use theirs knowledge for understand the everyday reality. and, sure, the dialogs. result- a different comedy who propose not ordinary side of a social category. a precise job by each member of team. and happy way to impose few questions about the other. I'm giving 8 for this TV show, but it's not quite charming these days. I wanted a show about the geeks. This show was technical and excellent. People are not suppose to understand THINGS, they are suppose to laugh. When the show started, every unique character e.g. Sheldon, Howard etc. showed their extraordinary geek type talent with a romantic twist. The way it started with penny; like trying too hard to workout for Howard was awesome. But now eventually the characters are getting boring. I still like this show, its humorous & funny. The writers should be more attentive to include those attractiveness of the characters which made this TV show special, in order to make something fresh and new. I prefer the earlier seasons. I am always wary of comedies/Especially American comedies as there sees to be no understanding of subtle humour,satire or sarcasm.But I ended up watching the Bog-Bang theory;simply because it was on at a time when everyone sat down and put the TV on(lock-in time in prison). I find that they always have to either explain the joke,sometimes more than once,or use 'canned' laughter to prompt a reaction to a gag. However,subject aside,the actors (timing and interaction) play their parts in what is a really great show.I feel kinda stupid even saying this and my son gives me hell,as he deems it to be simple and ridiculous.But maybe that is what makes it funny.I can't be sure,but I do know that I have every episode on my external hard drive;usually a place reserved only for the very bast films or TV I have seen.It IS funny.Take away the laughter and see if it is still funny-I think it will be.But maybe I am just getting old.I will still never watch another re-run of morcambe&wise especially at Christmas?I wonder if this will fall by the way side in the same way.roll on Christmas 2033 and we will see. I've never been a fan of sitcoms. However, my family absolutely loves TBBT so I've gotten into it by default. What I love most about the show is that although it's never said outright, Sheldon clearly has Aspergers Disorder. Our 14 y/o has Aspergers and I also work with children with Aspergers. We love talking about TBBT, and specifically Sheldon, at work. It's also been good for our son to see someone on TV who has some of the characteristics (albeit a Hollywoodized version) that he has who is successful in his career, has a group of friends and even a girlfriend. When I've been asked professionally what autism looked like, the only Hollywood reference was Rain Man. Thanks to TBBT, we now have Sheldon Cooper as an almost classic, lovable, funny Aspy. Jim Parsons, you're the best! Unlike most sitcoms which seem to focus on lowest common denominators for comedy, this does the opposite. In this most of the characters are 'geeky' and super-smart so it is the not-so-intelligent that are the butt of jokes. Geeks are the jocks in this, to coin a phrase, and as the tagline aptly says 'smart is the new sexy.' If you ever saw Real Genius (Val Kilmer) there are shades of that in this especially the competition between Kripke and the guys. <br/><br/>So, we have a core cast of four brilliant academics at CalTech (Galecki, Parsons, Helberg and Nayyar), and their cutesy not-so-bright neighbour Penny (Cuoco). Of course the boys are hapless around women, and Sheldon (the brilliant Jim Parsons) is a step beyond awkward in everyday life with Asperger's-like tendencies, together with his protegy genius status. He is so clueless about human-interaction they often refer to him as either an alien or a robot or tell him things are 'social convention' in order for him to participate in normal things he can't see the logic in and his social ineptness is the subject of much mirth. They are all obsessed with comic books, super-heroes, computer games, online gaming, dressing up etc etc and live in their own little world, which appears quite fun actually (you rarely see them working) and they seem self-motivating to do some different things. Series 6 is currently on air and it's not dropped a single bad episode so far. It's clever, well researched and funny from start to finish and has gripping episode story lines, as well as overall story arcs that keep you hooked. Great addition in series 3 is Mayim Bialik, PhD (Amy Farah Fowler) - the scene where she gets a tiara; priceless comedy acting, perfect timing. It's all hilarious, and great writing from Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady. Chuck Lorre's best yet IMHO. Lots of cameo appearances most notably Stephen Hawking!! I have seen many episodes,and still feel that each episode is like, the first in quality, which made me watch many in a zen manner,as to what is zen,a watching can be comfortable with the same people doing their work in a repetition of the scenery,which is possibly bland in what is attractive decor,their work is quality to meet a furnishings lacking,which in a schooling,the want is comprehension complete with market acceptance.<br/><br/>The good quote marks,are in the way a screen play can become a cube of reality,to keep a same view with the persons involved in making,a wanting from anyone's house buying progress is a stamina to actually look with a good result in confident signing,and that is why a television show can be the zen mastering equality for in fairness...Larry Someone recommended this series to me, so I decided to give it a chance, especially since I'm on holidays now.<br/><br/>You probably know most of the show even if you hadn't seen it: A couple of geeks meet an attractive woman, one of them tries to get laid with her while another displays all known and unknown mental disorders that are borderline-autistic. That's a story that had been told before.<br/><br/>The show highly puts some effort on plot-irrelevant jokes and that are mostly taken out of any context, are mostly cheap and not funny at all because you a) have already heard/seen them on other shows or b) they are so predictable that you mostly find yourself facepalming and thinking "not again". The pseudo-scientific- and nerd-humour does help at times, but it's not like The Big Bang Theory reinvented the wheel here. I'm very grateful however that the show, being a typical sitcom, does make use of the canned laughter because otherwise I wouldn't be able to tell whether I was supposed to laugh or not.<br/><br/>I have watched the first 5 seasons so far and every time an episode ended I got the feeling the writers just were too lazy to write a proper ending because it stopped all of a sudden without any bridge. Sadly, I was also frequently asking myself "soo... that's it?" because I was expecting some great joke, turning point or climax to give some relevance to the episode or at least turn it worth watching. However, I could find neither of those.<br/><br/>I'm giving the series a 4, because the characters do have some charm, though Penny and Sheldon just annoy me most of the time. However, most of the jokes miss good points and the plot is very weak, especially because most of the jokes retell unseen situations in the show that would actually be more interesting to see. The show was somehow enjoyable throughout the first 3 seasons, after that it was kept going downhill, though I can't even say why exactly. It just all felt as if it had all been done before to some degree, but perhapt it's just that you can't hang on to those characters for very long without eventually growing sick of them. All in all, the show lacks the ingredients of a good series. I love the storyline and the characters work so well together! Sooo funny! It is one of the most legendary sitcoms CBS ever aired but not like friends or the office. Every show has its golden age this one's its perfect ending. you could enjoy this show if you really manage to feel like one of them or as an outsider with sympathy When Nerds and Geeks rise up and are the main ingredients of a sitcom that works quite well. Including the villain itself who's also the friend, who's also quite oblivious to what he's doing while being the smartest in the room. Well something along those lines.<br/><br/>There are clear lines and there are some decent jokes at the expense of certain individuals. But overall you will come to learn the main characters and love them. Cliches? Yes. Archetypes and all that. And some of the things may only apply or be funny if you indulge them.<br/><br/>Having said that, there is so much fun to be had. And as far as sitcoms go, this may have one of the most satisfying and best endings I can think of ... I was surprised when I saw that high rating on the final episde, but after watching it, I have to say I do agree. So if for nothing else, this may very well be one of the reasons to watch the whole thing! You will not be dissapointed (even if it contains the now outdated laugh track throughout) Make a branch off series when they lost the keychain with the bitcoin on it and sheldon had the USB drive. Then it just branches from where the group was and turn into if they were all rich. It was one of the funniest shows on television. Sheldon is my favorite characters because I think he was so funny. I only wish I could learn physics by watching the big bang theory. What else can I say besides it was out of this world funny. Till season 5 - A complete 10 but after season 5 - 8/10. It was more fun when they were single but when they all started to get into relationships, it lost some of the charm,
especially Howard and Sheldon's character. Absolutely one of the best shows I've watched. The characters are unique and enjoyable. This show became a staple part of my families evenings. After becoming so emotionally involved in the lives of these characters for more than a decade I hated to see it end. My wife and I recently binge watched every episode only to feel that same sense of loss after becoming so emotionally invested in these characters. Was sad to see it end. I used to watch this series again and again when I feel lonely or boring because all the characters are like my friends.When I see them, I remember my own girlfriend, best friends,family. I feeled like they are around me. Now I already watch s1 to s12. But I am not sure how many times I will watch again and again this awesome series The big bang Theory. Good to watch with family. Every episode is filled with laughter from beginning to the end One of my favorite TV shows. I can watch it over and over and never lose interest. Funny and insightful. One of the few shows I can just put on and let it play. Am just glad the show ended. of late it'd become unbearable to watch. it started as a very funny show.... very funny. with time it just lost its touch. The only reason why i finished even the unbearable dry jokes seasons was because it really made my days when it began. i owed it that much. A lot of the sitcoms/romcoms out there resemble each other in one way or the other but The Big Bang Theory really stands out. It is almost ironic how cool this show is given that the story line revolves around a group of nerds (and a hot chick). What sets it apart from the other tv shows is the creation of this rich backdrop of science and if you pay attention to the nerds talking about all the science stuff, you actually might learn a thing or too! With such an incredible and super talented cast, The Big Bang Theory never really misses a punchline.
Not being too overly dramatic, it is definitely one of the more hilarious tv shows. Unlike a lot of the other tv series with controversial series finales, TBBT kept things simple and not too complicated and the fans loved it! It is a mixture of hilarious jokes, science, superheroes, love and friendship which makes it an absolute must watch! I write this review with the intention of encouraging and reassuring anyone who felt as I did, discouraged and hesitant by the prospect of watching a show of which I have a very loose connection to. In the sense that i'm not a particularly hardcore nerd (although i do enjoy several cult Sci-Fi shows, like Doctor Who) and that I am in no way, a science genius, my knowledge is pretty standard. This shouldn't dissuade you from watching one of the greatest sitcoms America has ever churned out.<br/><br/>You shouldn't fear not understanding the science babble or pop culture references, you'll be brought right up to speed, even though understanding the references won't damage the comedy.<br/><br/>The comedy is intellectual and witty.<br/><br/>The show from the outside may seem overtly-intellectual it is surprisingly focused on the mundanity of life, focusing on pretty normal themes which everyone can relate to.<br/><br/>The Big Bang Theory is a cleverly engineered sitcom based on characters, their personality, quirks and the way they interact with each other, it's pretty normal. Revolving around a team of nerds, you'll watch them grow, as you laugh along with them. Sheldon's chemistry with all the characters is just a joy to behold, his insuppressible obnoxiousness is surprisingly endearing, sucking you in and never letting you go.<br/><br/>Frankly it's just terrific comedy, and while some of the running jokes may begin to wear thin, you'll be well into the last 2-3 series by then, so you won't even care because of how engaged you are with this terrific ensemble.<br/><br/>So strap yourself in for a 12 series marathon, and prepare for the Big Bang to kick-start your binge watch. I mean it is the finale season, but raj still has no girlfriend why???? Just watch guys, totally worth it 😍😍 ama,in cast and direction. The last ever episode was just THE Best ending of the amazing TBBT journey 🖤 The best sitcom that I have ever seen. Very underrated.
Most people complain that the show lost its course after season 7. It lost its nerd factor. But I think as in normal life, people change over years, so did the characters of the show. The characters matured, their relationships changed. You cannot expect that Howard to be a horny and crass person all his life. After marriage obviously he would change. Same with all the characters. You cannot expect Leonard still trying to woo Penny and Penny still dating other losers. They all had to change and mature.
The only character arc they did not give justice to was Raj. I would have liked to see him get settled over the final season. They should have married him to Ruchi. It would have been a good end. It's my daily go-to for comical laughs and it has been my favorite show since I was in highschool. I literally grew up with this show and I will continue to binge-watch it for so many hours a day, especially at night. I am so heartbroken to see it ending after 12 years. Thank you for everything! Watch the first 5 seasons. 6-12 just gets progressively worse. First 5 are solid 8-10 ratings. Been watching this show since the first episode and every episode has been entertaining. Sheldon is the most annoying character in the show.<br/><br/>The show is now coming to an end and I think it's a good time to end it as everyone married. The first few series were funny and enjoyable, but it became old and tired unfortunately the same as almost every American Sit-com. I can persevere through some seriously poor shows hoping they will get better. This started off great and went so similar all the other American Sit-coms....see what I did there repeating myself with a tiny change of dialogue in between. Every episode of these shows ever. Jerry Seinfeld once said he cancelled Seinfeld while it was the #1 show, because he didn't want to overstay his welcome. I wish the Big Bang Theory had done the same thing. It was one of the best shows ever, but should've ended a couple seasons ago. It is really amusing TV Show that I love and I hope they contiue that way also I miss sheldon's bazengas The Big Bang Theory is a very good series, and for the first few seasons I really enjoyed it.
I think in later years the series has lessened in my approximation, I can't say I've overly enjoyed it much since they introduced Amy (or Bernadette to a degree)<br/><br/>I think they have also gone down the Simpsons path too much, and by this I mean the numerous guest stars who pop up - Professor Stephen Hawking, Brent Spiner, Wil Wheaton, Mark Hammil, Bill Gates, Steve Wozniak, Stan Lee, Bob Newhart, Buzz Aldrin, Katee Sackhoff, George Takei, Leonard Nimoy, Adam Nimoy, Mike Massimino, Summer Glau, Adam West, Bill Nye, James Earl Jones, Carrie Fisher, Elon Musk, Charlie Sheen, LeVar Burton, Neil deGrasse Tyson and I'm sure there's more I missed but I think I made my point.<br/><br/>But what has really ruined the Big Bang Theory for me is not so much thier fault, but the incessant repeating of every episode on TV, and worse still the episodes are never shown in any order as they are hand picked to meet a certain criteria (Mother's Day, Christmas, Father's Day etc)
I find the episodes so tediously repetitive that it puts me off watching it at all. TV schedulers give us a Big Bang break!<br/><br/>I didn't really watch the latest series as it has gone too far down in my approximation, but I saw moments of it and I did see the wedding at the end, I think they matched thier version of Sheldons brother to the Georgie in Young Sheldon well (that's a funny show, and a good programme despite my opinions of it before it's release - the adverts for it weren't great)
And Sheldons mother is always very good, I don't know why they changed Sheldons sister though? Love the way the story progresses . A different type of show and very funny jokes it is interesting to see the way the characters progress over time . Season 11 and still going strong. Not as funny as it used to be but thats normal as every series goes on a downhill road after a few seasons .Despite that still love it.Coming from a guy in the engineering field (:-p) Over the course of this sitcom the writers have failed miserably. It started out ok but in some ridiculous assumption they thought making the characters more asinining and annoying makes them funnier. It does not it's just frustrating. Sheldon's odd personality will sort of relate to you. You will feel passionate. You will feel happy. You will feel annoyed. But you will love this show. I guarantee it. <br/><br/>Watching this show will change your life. It will change the way you look at Physics, it will change the way you look at people. It will change you, but definitely for the better. I'm probably in the minority here, but I think this show is very overblown. <br/><br/>Do people just not have anything else to watch??? When they say CBS is America's most-watched network, that says a lot, folks. Why is anyone watching CBS in 2017 for entertainment? There isn't much there, though this show is better than some I've suffered through.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, and Sheldon is dating the chick from Blossom. LOL.<br/><br/>Why is the lead actress dating the other little dude from Roseanne in real life? Must really be a shortage of men in Hollywood, or arranged, or something. LOL. Or maybe he is way cooler than he is on the show. <br/><br/>All these dudes are so nerdy and wimpy they just come across as neurotic weirdos, extreme losers, or super gay. Sheldon playing a straight dude was also beyond belief for me, as I thought he acted very, very gay, even before I knew he was gay in real life. <br/><br/>It feels more like a BRAVO or lifetime group of gay dudes running around spouting Star Trek technology language than anything else. <br/><br/>It has some funny moments, and I watched it for a little while, but nothing really amazing here. Much of it is just so nerdy that I don't even see how many people connect with it. I think the Sheldon dude is honestly only so popular with this show and a new spin-off show because he is gay. He is probably sleeping with some producer in Hollwyood or something. The other people on the show are annoying and I can't really identify with them. The title(though obviously from evolution), reminds me of the title of a porn film at this point. If you like semi-smart psycho babbble and some goofy, annoying gay dude insulting people(if I am going to watch that, I would prefer to see Doogie Howser in How I Met Your Mother), and a bunch of awkward nerds struggle just to lose their virginity and have their testicles drop, this show is for you.<br/><br/>Not the worst show ever, and Caley Cuoco was worth seeing(Before they whacked her hair off), but this show is more overblown than Seinfeld, in reality. Very mediocre, and I am voting a star or two lower than I would have, just because the rating for this is absurdly high at 8.3 or whatever. Now when I say that this sitcom is a "fallback program," I mean that it's the type of comedy that I'll switch to during the interval of a more higher praised show, like CSI or Dirty Sexy Money. It's more like a safety net for comedy when I come home on a dull afternoon and my Xbox has the Red Ring.<br/><br/>The Big Bang Theory, is worth a watch if you saw the canceled show, The Class, in advance. The Class was disappointing through my eyes and The Big Bang Theory rose my spirit and faith in sitcoms ever so slightly. I myself flick onto it from time to time and I'm never lead a stray in trying to analyze any characters which can be a treat when some days all I'm looking for is Liter hearted humor.<br/><br/>However, the only problem I had with this show, unlike Friends, was the trouble I had trying to find deep substance in the characters. Sure, it can be nice when you just want to watch a funny sitcom regardless of the acting but naturally we as humans look for more. They all seemed to be on the nerdy, science extreme and I personally never saw them in any other shade. In Friends, Chandlers extreme sarcasm was broken down by his love for Monica. Joey too, was seen to not be a total sex addict after falling for Rachel. Everyone was diverse in the show (Even Gunther!). But The Big Bang Theory, right now appears the same in terms of the Characters personalities. <br/><br/>All in all, the show lacks in character diversity but performs decidedly well to it's genre. I quite like it.<br/><br/>Overall score:<br/><br/>A very generous 7/10 This show is great but then comes amy . She is completely irritating . I have to run video faster when she talk. I have been watching this show since the beginning. I've loved the relationship developments between each character. But I'm frustrated that the relationship between Amy and Sheldon has taken a dramatic turn for the worse recently. Amy used to find Sheldon's quirks cute, but now she is more vocally mean to him than anyone else. She snaps at him in the same way that Howard always has. I'm just not happy with the change. One of the funniest shows out there. I can always count on a laugh from TBBT. There are some questions out there that I might be able to address.<br/><br/>I get what most of the complaining is about. The whole Wolowitz getting married. Raj getting a crazy girlfriend, Sheldon and Amy Farrah Fowler, don't even get me started. And of course the beloved couple of Penny and Leonard. In the beginning of the series the main focus was on Penny and Leonard, but as time went on it seems the writers wanted to expand the other characters lives also. So Penny and Leonard broke up and then Amy and Bernie came along. Granted it's great seeing Blossom again. So the focus has been taking off of the main stars and though they are dating again, we are waiting for them to either break up again or Penny popping the question.<br/><br/>I will be a fan till the end. Funny to this day. Great, feel good, late night comedy. Big Bang Theory is a master piece and it will be remembered for a very long time like the other famous Sitcoms like Seinfeld etc.<br/><br/>I have watched all episodes till season 5, it was an excellent ride for me. I came across such a nice program in years. lot of TV shows are disturbing with lot of characters and people inside in one episode. However, BBT and Two and a half men are best sitcoms which have their own style. Slow moving, not many characters around, not disturbing, calm neat and tidy acting.<br/><br/>Sheldon, Lenard, Howard, Raj, Penny have really rocked and made so many people laugh across the whole world. The writing should have been so difficult as many of Sheldon's dialogs were not just mere sarcasm but would have been written after doing lot of research and thinking.<br/><br/>I hope that such Sitcoms run for long time on TV I caught the odd episode of this a while back (I've since worked out they were Season 3 episodes) and really enjoyed them. I never watch TV series when they are broadcast preferring to buy them on DVD or Blu-Ray so i can watch them when i want.<br/><br/>I bought the Seasons 1 to 4 box and have recently added Season 5 on Blu-Ray and watched them all in quick succession.<br/><br/>TBBT has to be up there with the best series i've ever watched. There isn't a bad character in it. Sheldon and Leonard are the obvious stars on the show but the rest are close behind them.<br/><br/>The humour behind them all is genius and i for one love how the characters are developing and the show is turning in to a funny drama. I care what happens to each and every one of them.<br/><br/>I shall be buying Season 6 real soon and watching 4 or 5 episodes a night until its finished and then i may just start all over again! The show is fu**ing acted in front of a live audiences you idiots....it is not a laugh track,people actually think the show is funny and I agree but the jokes might fall flat sometimes and the audience might overreact but the show is actually a quite funny and hilarious sit-com to watch when you are feeling down or bored as it can actually cheer you up.The show may not have a grand plot of any sort like How I met Your Mother and such but it is quite funny for a show without a main plot. If I had to rate the top 5 best comedy shows at the moment,Big Bang Theory would be there without a doubt.Maybe it's not as great as past comedic greats like Arrested Development but it's one of the funniest shows you can watch at the moment This is one of the best shows I've ever watched in my life. The characters have depth, they're not stereotypical characters you'd expect to see in any other show. As unusual as they are, you can always find a way to connect with them, and understanding their behaviors is actually easy. Once you've watched twenty episodes or so, you'll feel like those guys could be your friends because you'll know them so well. The language used is not too complex, and even though some jokes may sometimes involve physical, chemical or biological concepts, they're easy to understand for anyone with minimum knowledge about these matters. To sum up, their super- smartness is simple to understand and the story lines are easy to follow. It really is a show worth watching. Just watched most recent episode - When Sheldon wants something bad, he will do anything for it! Some great scenes. Especially with Stephen Hawking at the end! Wow. Sheldon gets what he wants, but what he has to do to get it it brilliant! I love how Howard stands up for himself and makes Sheldon actually do something for others .. A great Episode! Only been watching this since last month, i have got through all 5 Seasons already, i love it! I heard that there are at least another 2 Seasons on the way, which is awesome! This is a great show for a pick me up .. when u just want to escape. This episodes just shows how all the characters are expanding and growing, so i cant wait to see what else the writers have in store for us in the future episodes. They have already done over 100 episodes so far, and from what i hear all the cast are up for another 100! :D I love all the Characters, and i am starting to enjoy the Newbies, Amy and Bernadette! Wander what will happen with them in the future too, most interestingly Amy and Sheldon's relationship. Not long until Season 5 finale .. wonder what will go down at Howard's Party? Great show .. My new favourite Sit Com! Up there with Friends! Bring on more!!!!!<br/><br/>THE END The Big Bang Theory is the story about, four nerds, Leonard(Johnny Galecki), Sheldon(Jim Parsons), Howard(Simon Helberg) & Raj(Kunal Nayyar) who live in Pasadena, California. Leonard & Sheldon are roommates who get a new neighbor, Penny(Kaley Cuoco). Penny lives across the hall from Leonard & Sheldon. Leonard has always liked Penny, from the time she moved in. So, Leonard & Penny's relationship is one of the primary things in the story. However, the highlight of the show, is the over achieving & brilliant Dr.Sheldon Cooper! Jim Parsons has done a bang up job in his portrayal of a brilliant yet, socially awkward physicist who provides most of the laughs on the show! However, Leonard, Penny, Howard & Raj are hilarious as well! Another highlight of the show is, Dr.Rajesh Koothrapalli, a man who was born and raised in India. He is an astrophysicist, who is brilliant in his field but, is incredibly socially awkward & cannot talk to women unless he's drunk or thinks he's drunk. Kunal Nayyar has done a spectacular job in portraying the brilliant, yet shy, Raj. The Indian jokes are hilarious without being offensive. Dr. Leonard Hofstadter is a man, who's not as brilliant as Sheldon in his field but has a lot more common sense and is the least nerdy in the group. Johnny Galecki has done a brilliant job in his portrayal of Leonard. Howard Wolowitz is the only person in the group who doesn't have a doctorate. He justifies this by saying he has a master's degree from MIT. He's also kind of a player & tries desperately to hit on women often failing in the process. This is what makes Howard so hilarious. Not to mention his arguments & loud conversations, with his mother(voiced by Carol Ann Susi)! Simon Helberg has done an outstanding job in his portrayal of Howard. Penny, is an aspiring actress & a waitress at The Cheesecake Factory, where the group eat often. Penny is funny because she's so different from the boys when it comes to intelligence or socializing, out of which, she's amazing at the latter. Her conversations with Sheldon, is another factor because, half the time, she can't make head or tail of what Sheldon is trying to say! Kaley Cuoco has done an awesome job in her portrayal of Penny. Other funny elements of the show are, Sheldon's spot on the couch, Sheldon's Obsessive Compulsive Disorder about everything, the way Sheldon knocks on the door, Sheldon's 'Bazinga', the way Sheldon laughs, Leonard's wooing of Penny, the way Raj talks to women when he's drunk, Penny's on & off boyfriend Zack(Brian Smith), Howard's relationship with his girlfriend Bernadette(Melissa Rauch), Sheldon's carbon copy, Amy(Mayim Bialik) & Raj's sister Priya(Aarti Mann). The supporting characters, like comic book store owner Stuart(Kevin Sussman) are brilliant as well! All in all, The Big Bang Theory is a brilliant show & is worth watching by everyone! Thank you, Chuck Lorre & Bill Prady for giving us the only & awesome sitcom about nerds! I own the first two seasons of the big bang theory, I also happen to own the first 7 seasons of Two and a Half Men from the same writers.<br/><br/>In my opinion this show is a 10/10. It has everything that I personally enjoy: great writing, good character rapport and enough wit and jokes that require at least some thought to keep me interested. Furthermore it is not as raunchy as Two and a Half Men, though sex and sexual jokes seem to be more commonplace now than when the series first began, it is still not the main premise of most episodes which instead focus on these quirky, nerdy guys...who at first appear annoying (especially Sheldon) but in time grow up the viewer.<br/><br/>I find that Sheldon and Harold are the two characters that drive the show in terms of laughs. Others could easily disagree, but I find that in terms of humour and acting abilities those two characters do it for me. Every character has their value to the show and it wouldn't be the same if either Penny, Raj or Leonard were not written in, but I always look forward to the lines and lives of Sheldon and Harold to draw laughter.<br/><br/>Sheldon (Jim Parsons) in particular is impressive with his typical fast talking Texan style (without the drawl) that keeps my attention. He does the most physical acting of all of the main characters and his antics are (sometimes disturbingly) hilarious.<br/><br/>Harold is just one of those try hard dorks who exudes an awkward confidence even though he doesn't realize quite how much of a nerd he is. His home life with his mother is comical and provides otherwise unexpected laughs when they are together (though she is never seen). His moms lines always embarrass Harold and it is her blunt comments and his reaction that brings a smile (in some ways some of my own funny memories as a young man).<br/><br/>I could go on and on, but in a quick summary, if you haven't seen the show take the time to watch it. If you happen to not like it at first, watch a few more episodes, the characters will grow on you, I assure you and unlike most shows, there are enough casual characters that interact with the main characters to bring a different dynamic and infusion of funny lines.<br/><br/>10/10 The Big Bang Theory is not only funny, its lol, funny. This is one of the few TV comedies that will actually have you laughing intensely at some of the ridiculously plot concepts. This comedy has something for everyone. A little comic and Sci-Fi for those who indulge, also a bit of technically advanced biology and particle acceleration talk. Now, usually those format topics do not co-mingle well. However The Big Bang Theory, the cast, and witty writers make it fun, and even hip, to want to be a nerd. This show does everything well from the actually gear that the cast wears to the props: think the comic shop, to finally the back and forth banter. This is a must see for those who enjoy a smart comedy, there is no stupid humor here. No, I dare not say it. This is what I wrote about a year ago: As more of a movie buff, there's only been two television shows I have gone out of my way to watch in the last 30 years - Seinfeld and this one. My first thought on seeing this several months ago was it was a funny show but it was a one-trick-pony that would get old quick. I'm probably 100 shows in and still waiting for it to get old. Kaley Cuoco is semi-starving actress living in apartment across from two of the biggest geeks to ever hit television (Galecki and Parsons), as well as their two frequent, equally-geeky visitors Helberg and Nayyar. Each of the geeks has their own eccentricities, but Parsons is almost from another planet. I know Parsons has the Emmys but in my mind Galecki is the focus of the show, and Cuoco makes it really run. If you like her kind of athletic looks Cuoco is just about as attractive as they come on television (only trumped by Barbara Eden from many years back). UNLIKE Seinfeld, which lost some of its luster down the stretch and had several mediocre episodes, I have yet to see an episode I didn't like. Seeing Wolowitz scream at his mom that he's not a teenager anymore and then ask what's for dinner never gets old. A real gem, a top ten all-timer. This is what I say now: Having hit the wall on this show, I have seen enough. They really made too few shows each year to have a truly Seinfeldian rerun life. And they had a really inappropriate "joke" within the past year that should offend many Christians, they crossed the line big time. For all of Kaley's great charm I think I'm done. A unique show with tons of laughs love the quirky nature of all the cast members. Writing is amazing!!! and the delivery of the lines is fantastic! Some episodes are not for kids, but my kids love the wardrobe because it is many times similar to their own. I like to watch the re-runs on TBS as well as the new shows on CBS. I really love the broken elevator, the Cheescake Factory, and the comic book store. I like that many of the actors on the show were once child actors and I'm happy that they are still enjoying success. I hope the show goes on for a long time and I wish continued success to all the actors and actresses on the show. Another masterpiece by Chuck Lorre! SO instead I go on and boast about this series look below what's in it for you,<br/><br/>For those who haven't seen it this will blow your mind off if you ever had science lessons...so many facts and the sarcasm related to them will make you remember your NERD friends...Jim's acting is awesome and same is true for other characters because they seem to be real and not fictional... I am sure everyone would have had met (or friends) with one of the characters portrayed in this sit-com..<br/><br/>For everyone else let's hope CBS continues this for-ever....I watch this when I feel lonely and sad, this is one of my feel good options. if you enjoy the generalization of nerd and laugh tracks your gonna love this show!!! It has everything you want. Like bad jokes being reused just by adding bigger words into them to make you feel smart. I felt so smart watching this show because i was able to get the jokes even though they had some (although used often and anyone should know them) complicated words in them. Best thing about it is when you your not sure there was a joke the laugh track helps you know. Thank god for laugh tracks otherwise I would never know what is funny!!!! My only warning would be if you don't like generic jokes repackaged with a still 80's-90's idea of what a nerd is and think laugh tracks are patronizing and annoying you may hate this show. But what do I know I'm an idiot :) I have seen few episodes of this series. The Title is very impressive, and it could manage to attract many first time viewers. The series is in it's beginning and I believe it has much more to offer, but till now it is very disappointing. First time viewers were curious about it (as I have mentioned the title is very attractive), but in the end it seems to be a discordant jargon. Humors are not 'so' funny, and they are overloaded with scientific babbles. The identity of each character is not defined yet, but this is obvious as the series is in its infancy. Overall I believe that we hope to see some great humor in this series, but till now this is very ordinary. There are some good jokes, but most of them are bad tasted. <br/><br/>To praise the creative of the producers, Sheldon is as obnoxious as a human can image.<br/><br/>It's not a happy comedy. It makes me feel sick every time.<br/><br/>I have been a fun of sitcom for long time. I have given it a try, but after about five episodes, I cannot stand it anymore. I rather go back to watch old sitcom DVDs. Or even those just for laugh. They at least make me laugh without side effect of feeling sick.<br/><br/>The worst of it is ,they try to make as obnoxious as possible. What on earth, views like to be bothered living with an obnoxious guy, it worst than living in person. BBT had a chance to do an actually ORIGINAL storyline with Howard's baby, such as having the scientist mom decide to actually STAY AT HOME for the first year or so, to develop the baby's intellect and emotional IQ. But no, they fall for the unthinking and trendy decision to put the baby in daycare with strangers who don't love her, at most like her, so that mom can run back to work. Oh, puh lease! Way to ruin a good chance at someone from that generation making an ORIGINAL decision for once, and not just buying the whole "babies in daycare do just FINE" BS that everyone wants to believe. It just makes the characters look like suckers who buy everything hook, line and sinker.<br/><br/>And on top of it, the baby is ALWAYS sleeping! Never in the kitchen or living room with her parents. Everybody Loves Raymond showed a family that actually included children. Wonder why the producers of BBT think it would hurt the show so much to have the child included in the family. Scientists can't be loving devoted parents as well? What is this fantasy land? <br/><br/>I'm also concerned about the upcoming "Young Sheldon" series. Old Sheldon obviously has a pretty healthy case of Asperger's, but I can't see them having a young child act autistic, and I think the show is a big mistake. Plus I liked that kid from "Big Little Lies" and I hate to see him exploited and ruined by starring in a new series. He's a cutie pie, and we all know what happens to most child stars. Leave him alone. This show it a disappointment to the film and TV industry and arguably one of the worst shows to grace the earth. Wow, this show has the characters being mean to each other often (Years 7 & 8).<br/><br/>Anger and subterfuge in The Big Bang Theory? Do the current writers hate the show now? <br/><br/>Years 1-4 or 5 were truly brilliant, Year 6 started to become pedestrian, and in Year 7 there were several episodes where the characters seriously undermined each other. <br/><br/>Sick.<br/><br/>Year 8, episode 2, is really nasty and unpleasant.<br/><br/>These new writers are sick. After hearing my friends highly recommending it i told myself it must be something good, so i started watching it. I kind of forced myself to watch it. After 3 episodes i felt like i wanted to smash my tv. All the humor in this show is extremely bad. The characters are some of the worst. People seem to like that Sheldon, but personally if i met him in real life i would slap him. I'm sorry to say this but the acting is horrible. Basically all you see in this show are people sitting on a couch, telling stupid things supposed to be funny and then you hear that background laugh sound. Definetly one of the worst shows i ever tried to watch One of the best sitcoms ever. Jim Parsons as Dr. Sheldon Cooper is one of the most unique characters ever played on television. From season 1 right through to season 12 a true masterpiece of a show.<br/><br/>Knock, knock knock Penny, knock knock knock Penny, knock, knock knock Penny!<br/><br/>I must admit, I am sorry to see it go. I don't get the negative feedback concerning the relationships in the show, sure, it was brilliant at the beggining, but it has a different take now, and it is also brilliant. Reccommended to everyone. I think the only reason Jim Parsons wants to end the show now is because he has so much money, that he's tied of counting his millions.<br/><br/>What is he going to do. Besides be the voice of Young Sheldon.<br/><br/>After all of these years, he's type cast. <br/><br/>What other show will see him in that he won't be associated with Sheldon.<br/><br/>Noting.... It's Great to see so many of the games, hobbies, shows and movies that the characters are into that i also loved and still do.<br/><br/>This was a great idea for a show. I hope to see more of these type of shows in the future! It involves a mix of science, technology, and more...<br/><br/>This show centers around best friends as University Physicists, Leonard Hofstadter and Sheldon Cooper, who both have a fundamental understanding about everything from the "inescapable pull of a black hole to the intricate structure of the atom".<br/><br/>But while they both have great minds and they know how to use them, their social ineptitude is heightened to astronomical proportions when beautiful Nebraska native Penny moves into the apartment across the hall from theirs.<br/><br/>Though, Penny may not possess Leonard or Sheldon's high aptitude in all things related to science, she does have the common sense and does know how the real world works and it creates hilarity e as brains clashes with beauty. This is one of the best sit-coms on TV right now. It revolves around these nerds who live next door to a hot chick. It's a pretty simple premise and really relies on character development type humor, kind of like "How I meet you r Mother". The characters in it are great. They seem almost like caricatures, but as you watch the show and see them develop, you really feel like you know them. The guys are Leonard, Raj, Howard Penny and later and Amy Farrah Fowler and Bernadette and of course Sheldon played by Jim Parsons, who steals the show and has won Emmys for this role. He delivers the best lines in the movie that make me laugh so hard. It's goofy and witty, but not over your head and pretentious. In fact it makes fun of pretentiousness. It also kind of reminds me a little of Cheers and Friends. I love this show- it's hilarious. Every episode used to be laden with extremely humorous jokes and gags; however, lately it has not been as excellent- maybe most of the jokes were used up. This is all forgiven though with Sheldon and Amy's very cute relationship. I recommend that you watch this highly. Leonard and Penny's relationship annoys me- maybe because I find Leonard extremely annoying and Penny too- I think that they are two pointless characters. Howard is hilarious in a creepy way and Bernadette is a fierce female. Sheldon is really funny and Amy is kind. Raj is the shyest which is why I like him the best. But the main factor of the show is the fact that each character is hilarious in their own special way. Last night was the first time I have watched an episode of Big Band theory.<br/><br/>I was really put off by the fact that they turned something as horrific as a boy being molested into a joke! <br/><br/>Regardless of whether it was 'made up' or not - this is not a laughing matter.<br/><br/>For all they know, the audience may have been people who have been affected by that - and Im sure that's not funny to them!<br/><br/>I really like tasteful comedy - but recently more and more references are made to things that we (public and audience) should be saddened about.<br/><br/>Its even in newspapers, some columnist was setting up his office in SOHO (kind of renowned red light zone) and revelling in telling his readers about the local brothel with its hardcore owner.<br/><br/>I mean, since when did other people's misery become something to joke about? From the little I know about that kind of life, its not nice in the slightest and the people are abused and often made addicts so that they work for their next fix. So this was good. Until as everyone else said, they started mixing relationship drama, then turning full drama. Then it dragged on for years and years. Tried watching again from the final seasons... and I couldn't stay in for 5 minutes. Wow. It's trying so hard to make you laugh now. It wasn't like that in the beginning. It's kinda dragging like what's happening with Grey's Anatomy. In fact there is no different. Doctors and Scientists that got nothing to do with science or medicine. Just relationship bull... this trend is getting old Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state Then nearly fourteen billion years ago expansion started, wait The earth began to cool, the autotrophs began to drool Neanderthals developed tools We built a wall (we built the pyramids) Math, science, history, unravelling the mysteries That all started with the big bang! Hey!<br/><br/>It's the song about the creation of our universe (Well the television universe) of four nerds whose life was created similarly as the universe. You might think what? Yeah the fictional life of different characters in the show begins because of a single atom of existence that decides to burst with a big bang into life and also creating life around it. Well you know the character; he has won 9 Emmy awards for 9 seasons for portraying his character as Sheldon Cooper. He is the guy in the middle of the photo. So what's so special about a single guy? As I said the writers created the other characters in the show encircling this single guy and that he would give success, joy, creativity, inspiration, etc to others surrounding him. Ha ha ha, who am I kidding? This guy is the absolute pinnacle of annoyance and the show has all sorts of jokes (physical and situational) because of this single guy. This guy carries the expectancy of many people worldwide on his shoulders.<br/><br/>Wait wait wait!!!The entire show is about nerds who talks about comic books, model trains, sci-fi and so little science. Well there comes a woman who is the exact opposite to all the other characters. She teaches the nerds what normal life is all about and becomes the only person who can control and resist their craziness. The name of the character is Penny (The most beautiful looking women in the photo). Sorry to the other two women, you are no match for Kaley Cuoco(Penny)as showed in the show and in reality.<br/><br/>paul96.org/THE BIG BANG THEORY-The Boisterous Band of Nerds<br/><br/>paul96.org/SHELDON COOPER-The Aggravating Physicist<br/><br/>paul96.org/Penny-The Gullible Mademoiselle<br/><br/>paul96.org/HOWARD WOLOWITZ & RAJESH KOOTHRAPPALI-The Diverting Duo<br/><br/>paul96.org/AMY FARRAH FOWLER & BERNADETTE ROSTENKOWSKI-The Wondrous Womanhood<br/><br/>paul96.org/LEONARD HOFSTADTER-The Narcissistic Nerd<br/><br/>paul96.org/THE BIG BANG THEORY-The Best Episodes I really always like the style of Sheldon and Leonard's apartment and in particular of Penny's flat. So I made a 3D Model of both apartments. spaces.archilogic.com/3d/!78e00607-8438-40c1-8185- fd51db42a079 You can really see that the living area is smaller in Pennys but also is more colorful, which I love. You have plenty of billboards in the boys apartment, which really show how geek they are! Enjoy. I absolutely love this show. For years I had never seen it and disregarded it, thinking it was bad. But then when I actually watched it, it was really funny. I love how we have never heard of Penny's last name. I wonder if we actually ever will. I love all of the characters and the cast portray them very well. I definitely like Season 4 and up better than the beginning, but that is only because of the roles of Amy and Bernadette. I felt like the first few seasons didn't have enough women. Some people I know, my sister mainly, think the show has gotten boring. If it got boring, then it wouldn't have been renewed for three seasons all in one go. And it definitely would've been cancelled before Season 10. My favorite character is Sheldon because I feel like i relate to him. Mainly with the social awkwardness and OCD tendencies. <br/><br/>This show is about four extremely smart scientists and there many struggles, and hilarious adventures, with their neighbor Penny, a normal person. Later in the show more scientists come in, but they're women. Which lead the men to have adorable relationships.<br/><br/>Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous. Since 2007, millions of viewers around the world have been mystified and amazed at the hilarity of four best-friend scientists, coupled with a wannabe actress as a next-door neighbor, have generated millions of laughs for the past eight years.<br/><br/>First off, the fan base is the biggest of any comedy on television... pretty much EVER! Over the past three seasons they've been averaging over 15 million live viewers per episode, and they deserve it, too! A cast of colorful characters composes this show, providing wise cracks and useful scientific info in virtually every aspect.<br/><br/>Sheldon Cooper (Jim Parsons), a somewhat narcissistic, misunderstood in terms of emotions, is a theoretical physicist who works for the science division of Caltech. Coupled with his roomie-turned-best-friend Leonard Hofstadter (Johnny Galecki), along with aerospace engineer Howard Wolowitz (Simon Helberg), astrophysicist Rajesh Koothrappali (Kunal Nayyar), and sarcasm expert Penny (Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting), they have made us all chuckle our heads off, while learning about the flaws of string theory and the particle acceleration of the Hadron Collider. Together the five have soared in the ratings over the past near decade, being extended through their tenth season.<br/><br/>The show has been awarded dozens of accolades, including two dozen Primetme Emmy nominations, a Golden Globe award, and various other prestigious awards. All in all, the group was raunchy at first, but now that seems to have calmed down, although it is still prevalent in some points of the show. I vote 10/10 for an absolutely gut-busting, world-changing performance from everybody on the show. Well done, BBT. Well done. I started to watch Big Bang a couple of years ago and while I'm not a die hard fan, it is pretty funny.<br/><br/>Part of having a good show that works is making sure the right people are in the right roles. I think everyone fits perfectly; the situations the characters get into and the writing is good.<br/><br/>Sheldon gets a lot of attention because he's complicated and may or may not be an Aspie, but I don't think so. I 'spect he's a mix of many things.<br/><br/>I'm glad Penny isn't the only woman on the show anymore, though it would be nice, just out of curiosity, to know what her last name is. Guess it'll be revealed eventually. This is by far the funniest show I have ever seen. Not only funny but the Big Bang Theory has a good story and just goes smoothly. My parents started watching soon after it started but I didn't get interested until about a year ago(mainly because that is when I started to get the jokes) and I have loved it since. I have seen about 70% of the episodes and am super excited for season 8. After watching most of the series I noticed only a few flaws and the biggest one is definitely the laugh track spamming. They do play it quite a lot but half the time i don't hear it over my own laughter. It is originally humorous and the laugh track is played because it actually IS funny. It's not Disney trying to tell you that it was supposed to be funny. It's hard to find a good show around with all these boring and stupid "reality shows" but don't be fooled by all the negative reviews, this show really is great, can't wait for more. This show is hilarious and funny of great fun. I don't think that I can ever watch an episode without laughing, which is good. It's exactly what you want from a comedy. I suggest this show to everyone who is looking for a good laugh. Even if you don't understand all the nerd humor and inside jokes, you'll definitely love the characters who all have their own great ways of making the show work. Sheldon Cooper may be one of the most neurotic characters on television and that makes the show all the most fun. You'll never feel like you're wasting time if the only thing are you doing is watching this show. I think that it is among the best things television has to offer and I think you'll like it too. I found this series to be outstanding. It's well written and well-acted but for some reason it hasn't "caught on" in a big way. Is it because people are more interested in reality TV or would they rather watch something that doesn't take up too much space in their brain? The characters in this show are so likable. I give it a final rating of 7 out of 10 because it's good but also kind of flawed. Everything about this series could make anyone laugh. This is a great series with a tone reminiscent of other great series. In the bundle of all that it lacks, I feel that the series is ignored for its creativity. Still, I thought this was cute and not bad at all. The big bang theory is the best TV program going round. Never seen anything funnier than the big bang theory literally it got me laughing until tears come out. Jim parson who plays Sheldon cooper Johnny Galecki who plays Leonard Hofstadter Kurnal Nayyar who plays Raj koothrappali Simon Helberg who plays Howard Wolowitz Kaley Cuoco who plays penny <br/><br/>every ones favorite character Sheldon cooper, he is good at playing Sheldon because of his facial expressions make his acting even funnier and the way he doesn't understand daily things<br/><br/>MUST WATCH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:D I was able to cut the whole season in half after skipping Leonard and Penny! The whole season and every episode revolves around Leonard and his friends. He is given the importance in every episode i lost my will to see after season 4. It's enough said that in eating scenes WHICH IS ALMOST 200TIMES IN EVERY EPISODE(!!!) almost never NO ONE eats anything!!!
The ya Re just move forks around And keep mixing food in dishes for no reason at all!!!!
Lot and lot of other stupid things.
Sheldon character makes you HATE him and also HATE him beside hating him. It is my favorite tv show, but God...I hate Bernadette so much. Such an irritating character. Season 1-6 is my favorite, but the show stayed for another 6 seasons still entertaining and funny differently. Only thing I am angry about it is the last 2 episodes. Such a shame they finished like this. I saw the last episode of the series today and it was really exciting.<br/><br/>In fact, in these last three episodes we see the culmination of the growth of all the characters:
Leonard gains confidence and stops to substimate himself so much and starts to think more about himself, later he faces his mother and makes peace with her (more or less),
Amy gains courage to change her look and take more care of her image, however the series didn't want to convey the idea that appearance matters more than personality and then it tries to counterbalance with the fact that sheldon, who is the one who really loves her the most, expresse that he liked her better before, when she was really herself, and I value this,
we also see Penny losing her fear of growing up and wanting to have a child, which was Leonard's dream for some time,
we see Raj making the difficult decision to deny Anu in preference to his longtime friends,
Howard and Bernedet continue their happy marriage with their two children,
Stuart takes the step of living with Denise,
even Bert kind of knows a new person,
and finally we see Sheldon winning what he always wanted most, the highest recognition certification a scientist can earn, winning a Nobel Prize, which sheldon ends up justifying with the strength and support provided by all his friends, giving everyone his due recognition, even Howard recognizing him as a person worthy of calling himself an astronaut, and congratulating Leonard for his son on the way, making a reference to the exact phrase spoken by Leonard himself in the first episode, after the first meeting with Penny, "Our children will be smart and beautiful" (what sheldon complements with "and imaginary" kkkkk (previous in the first episode also)).
Although he is an egocentric and selfish character, deep down he has good intentions, and all everyone wanted was to see him to win.<br/><br/>After finishing seeing the series and thinking about all the situations and adventures that these strange and interesting characters went through, I felt the need to summarize the grand finale, since this is as far as we can see them in their lives.<br/><br/>By the way, one thing I always thought funny was the fact that the mother of Howard was never shown, never shown in her house in a regular day or on the Thanksgiving day, or when howard tried to save her after telling her he would marrie Bernedet or on the hospital, never actually seen, only once a glimpse of her in the kitchen to satisfy the curiosity of the public, but that was what made that character actually so funny and unique.<br/><br/>I can say that I recommend the series, I don't regret for gave it a try and then stayed all the way until the last episode, in fact, I can even say that it was the best series I have ever seen, it was something that made me laugh many times and bring joy on less happy days, it might kinda sound weird but sometimes it made me feel less lonely.<br/><br/>In any case, until next time ... Happy hours every week!
you won't regret to watch this.It's funny and rigorous I recommend you to watch the show if u want to laugh it's a funny show to watch!! Finally finished it today!
I was one of the earliest adopters of the show (days when Netflix, other OTT content were rare and options of comedy limited on TV), so this was amongst the new funnier concept with four socially awkward scientists trying to interact with normal world.
Then mid seasons it started drifting of towards their couple-relationships, that is when it started getting boring. Maybe to show characters' development it was necessary but would have been good if some nerdiness from earlier seasons (1-4) could have been retained. Why the need to turn it to a Rom-Com where every guy (even the creepiest ones) gets to have a girl and settle down easily! If I wanted to see that I would have picked a 1.5hrs RomCom movie than a 12 season series.
Last seasons, I was very reluctant to pick up (especially after watching writers struggling with and messing up storyline from 8 till 10 where it trailed off more towards dramedy); and would not have bothered to stream online if they weren't available on Netflix now.
It's good that they decided to end it now and the person who took that decision was genius.
Best thing about it is the duration of each episode 19-20mins due to which can finish off a season easily. I love this show 😍 It's so funny! The actors are amazing and their humor is hilarious! I don't understand why some people don't like it. My favorite episode is "The opening night excitation" it's a really funny episode 😂 My opinion that the season 12 it's a little bit unnecessary. I enjoyed this show in its first season. Then somewhere along the line I heard about how much money these actors are paid per episode. Jealous much? Yeah, probably. But I still think those salaries are ridiculous. A real
turnoff. Which is exactly what I did. Thanks for the amazing 12 seasons, for the laughs and for the Bazingas! This is by far one of the most wonderful TV shows I have ever watched that I felt I am part of this amazing family. This show is the best sitcom ever. If you have little knowledge and interest on science, you will definitely love this show. Also, I got to learn many facts from this show like facts about interstate highway system and many more which Sheldon keeps mentioning in "irritating" way. This show is really funny and original. It's about four nerdy friends that work as scientists at Caltech in Pasadena. They like comic books, computer games, they don't have any muscles. Although these attributes are very sexy, girls don't think that nerdy boys are attractive. This show represents everyday life of "nerds". Common people are shown as stupid but happy. Things are going to be interesting when Penny, normal girl, become part of this nerdy group.
Sheldon is the most intelligent member of this group. His IQ is 187. However, he is not able to understand feelings of others. His roommate, Leonard, is Sheldon's best friend. Leonard fell in love with their new neighbor Penny. She looks very good, but Sheldon thinks that she is stupid. Last two members of this group are Howard and Rajesh Ramayan "Raj" Koothrappali. Raj is from India and he cannot talk to women without drinking alcohol. Howard is horny Jewish engineer. Sheldon makes fun of him because Howard does not have doctoral degree.
I love this sitcom. It shows problems of intelligent people. Every episode is original and characters are really awesome. I recommend this show to everyone who likes intelligent humor and nerdy subculture. First couple of seasons it was good, but then it was just showing same old sad acting college grads, also it gets boring when you know what the next dialog is going to be and when they keep having those laugh tracks. I don't know why people hate it so much, The big bang theory is one the best and funniest sitcoms I've ever seen, ignore what other people think of it. This show used to make me laugh until they brought Bernadette, dramatic relationships, and stupid generalizations of intellectuals into the show too much. Bernadette is an unfunny sociopath that uses people and this show magically makes it acceptable with a pretentious laugh track. Then, Amy and Penny magically get into relationships with the guys. And now Raj is used as the single punching bag. It is getting stale and tiring. So, I am not watching The Big Bang Theory anymore. Its former glory is season 1 through season 3 or season 4 for comedy. After that is just dramatic romance and drama queen Bernadette getting into the mixture. This show is finally getting the mercy kill it deserved a long time ago. I have to admit - initially I felt this show was trying to be something that was already done (e.g. Seinfeld, Always Sunny in Philadelphia) but it's really found its own skin. The characters have really grown on me and the situations are beyond hilarious. I watch them on repeat and still find moments funny - definitely check it out. We have gotten know the characters so well it seems we have ran out of interesting episodes, no one seems to change except for getting married. it's become pretty unpredictable at this point. The first few episodes were good, then it became boring. And now, it's 7 or more series past its sell date.
Sheldon is an obvious attempt at mocking homosexuality, not autism. Mocking homosexuality wouldn't fly, so they do it this way. And if the did try to mock autism - they failed. The true humor is elsewhere and looks nothing like it. If we combine intelligence, genius and comedy, it will produce four series:
1-The big bang theory.
2- The simpson.
3- Rick and Morty
4- Silicon Valley<br/><br/>I live in a love relationship with these programs ..
Sheldon Cooper and Homer-Bart Simpson, Rick and Morty without them life is absurd and empty.<br/><br/>I will not forget Howard and Leonard and the rest of the group, how fortunate I am because they are part of my mental, mental and fictional life.<br/><br/>Great thanks, and great respect for the authors and everyone who contributed to these great works. I really enjoyed the first four seasons but I'm not really feeling it in the fifth season and reading all the other reviews, I guess I'm gonna discontinue watching it. 
Fifth season onwards, its like there is one punch in 4 episodes that makes me laugh. That's it. And I think there is better stuff out there. I don't recommend this show. Unfunny, stupid and dull. From story lines to thin characters this show is a wreck and waste of our time. They thankfully cancelled two broke girls now please cancel this mess. 2 Chuckles out of the whole episode; if this is any indication of how this season is going to run, I'd say it's going with a whimper. The show has some progression, naturally, but I'm concerned that the writers are running dry on ideas. I haven't ever thought that the character of Sheldon, loss focus so easily, when he was serious about something important. Why be so laser beam from Kiss to Proposal, but (look! a chicken!) with a ringing phone? He's been unshakable when intent on a target, but to lose his seriousness when his phone rang, ... come on! I hope they step it back up in upcoming episodes. Don't get me wrong, I think Rick and Morty is a great and creative show unlike this thing (I also appreciate the writers of Rick and Morty). But the fanbases are similarly stupid. Perhaps not as toxic as would be the case with Rick and Morty, but come on. If anyone ever tells me they love the show for its ... INTELLECTUAL humour, I am going to laugh them off.<br/><br/>To be honest, the show seemed promising at first, I actually liked the first two seasons. However, it quickly found its formula for fun which revolves mostly around awkward social situations that geeks and nerds SUPPOSEDLY come through. While there is some truth to it, details are often skewed out of proportions, and to make it so LOL funny, they are going to add the audience laughing.<br/><br/>There is nothing on this planet Earth than watching this series without the audience tracks laughing. Without it, this would have never succeeded. Okay, at first, it actually was funny a bit more with the tracks, but the show quickly moved to type of 'humour' like ... Penny starts to puke (audience starts to laugh) ... WHY? That's when I turned it off and swore to myself never to watch this again.<br/><br/>It is not a genius show. In fact, it's not even a funny show. (Is it even a show?) It just tackles certain societal stereotypes in its own way, adds lol laughter and manipulates its audience into thinking they are watching some 'quality' entertainment when in fact they are watching absolute rubbish.<br/><br/>The only thing this show is genius about is manipulating millions of people in the world into thinking this is top notch amassing gargantuan critical acclaim. But people won't remember this show for long after it disappears, and it will once be perceived as one of the mistakes of the past that no one in their sane composure will be able to comprehend as to how this even was a thing, not to mention how popular it was.<br/><br/>Lastly, as I said above I have no respect for the writers of this 'show', neither do I have respect for any actor or just anyone involved in this shenanigan. Not to mention that Penny is now a sellout for an oil company claiming to be 'environmentally friendly', but it's just marketing jargon (luckily) many people saw through. Impact of everyone involved here will be quickly forgotten and this 'show' will become a graveyard of braindead ideas people once considered funny. Talk about the mistakes of the past ... :) Bazinga/10 for this one it is an EXCELLENT show! CBS YOU ROCK!!<br/><br/>The big bang theory has everything I could want in a partner- uh - I mean a show LOL! I am a science geek just like the boys (Sheldon, Raj,Harold, and Penny!) and I too am an awkward nerd! :-)<br/><br/>Form the first episode I watched I was a Big Bang fan. Penny (who plays a HOT blonde) is by far the star of the show, FORGET SHELDON!!!! lol I am on Penny's team every day!<br/><br/>There really isn't anything in this show that has been done before, just think about it. Since the 1960s kinda when comedy sitcoms were becoming a thing, it hasn't been very cool to be a science nerd. As a matter of fact, most science nerds got beat up- not a good time for science! Now there is a show that I along with a lot of others across the globe can relate to because we are true nerds! (Just think, we are nerdy so how can we relate to a show like Friends? ;-)) <br/><br/>My favorite episode, is where Amy makes dinner for Sheldon and then plays mario music from the game while she gives out the food! Of course, it is a scientific trick to get the guy to like her! it is because sheldon has ALWAYS liked Mario, the video game (he is SO goodnat this game). Well, since Amy wanted sheldon to like her she thought "this trick will make him think of me in a really good way, just like the way he views his nerdy video games! Bazinga!" Anyways, this good old trick works because he fell for the girl and they date now! Science RULES:-)<br/><br/>Overall the Big Bang Theory shows me that the geeks are here and the media cant tell us what to do! They are always saying oh you like starwars? HA thats a show for GEEKS. Not cool. But now with Sheldon and his clan they show that you can be a nerd AND get hot chicks like the ones in the shows. I hope this runs for some more seasons, at least it re-runs on TBS if that would be better instead! I have to say that this is one of the most entertaining shows I've ever watched! It's very clever yet appeals to a wide range of audiences. Important qualification for this review: I'm a nerd/geek/propeller head who studied high-energy physics and built his own laser. But I love how fundamental concepts are conveyed. My personal favourite has to be the final episode of season one. After all the discussions about Schrodinger's cat (an important though experiment dealing with quantum mechanics,) Penny's reaction to Leonard's kiss ("okay, the cat's alive") literally had me convulsing with laughter.<br/><br/>I had to steer my IT coworkers to this show since it wasn't easy to figure out the theme simply based on the show title. It actually took me until season three to figure out that it was the Canadian band "Barenaked Ladies" who sang the theme song. Multi-layered, intelligent and funny, I now have most of the seasons on BluRay for when I need a quick pick-me-up. Highly recommended! This is totally my favorite show I love Chuck Lorre I wait to watch the whole season of a season when it comes out on so I am waiting for Season eight to come out because I have seen and watched all Seasons 1-7 like five or six times I have a lot of Big Bang Theory Merchandise. I love the catchphrase Bazinga! And I also love the actors and all of the characters. My favorite character if I had to pick would have to be "Leonard" also known as... "Johnny Galecki". He was Russ in Christmas Vacation when he was like twelve or thirteen or even maybe eleven when he made and did that movie and film. I love this show you should definitely go and check it out if you have not already! I had never heard if this show till four years ago and only watched it because I heard that Summer Glau was appearing as herself in one episode. Having watched it three times I decided to buy the first series and watch it from the beginning. I was hooked from the first joke. The idea of four nerds (and one hot girl) appealed to me as I was a glasses wearer at school and my favourite subjects were physics and maths. Although my i.q. is nowhere near as high as Leonard's, I identified with him because of his aspirations to 'get the girl' something I could never do at his age. The story of Dr. Leonard Hofstadter and Dr. Sheldon Cooper along with their friends Dr. Raj Koothrappali and Mr. Howard Walowitz and their attempts to fit in with the streetwise Penny is hilarious from the outset. With a raft of running gags ranging from Sheldon's OCPD (Knock Knock Knock Penny) Raj's selective mutism, being unable to talk to women without alcohol (till the 8th series) Leonard's lactose intolerance and Howard's lack of a doctorate ('Howard, you know a lot of Doctors) and quirky side characters like Stuart Bloom, the comic book store owner, Barry Kripky and Mrs Wolowitz, this series is a serious contender for the funniest program of all time. It certainly is my choice. WARNING: PROBABLY A LOT OF SPOILERS, ESPECIALLY ABOUT SEASON 7 !!!<br/><br/>I only got into this show on account of my Mom, uncle and brother, who kept saying, "This is such a funny show! Watch it!" It took them from '07 to '10 to get me to pay a little attention to it. <br/><br/>At first it seemed like the producers/writers/crew were trying to say to me, "Look how UNcool these geeks and nerds are around this gorgeous blonde babe." And that made me mad. Why another show making fun of smart people who aren't so good-looking or smooth, and who aren't so skilled at going to boring bars/clubs to pick up women or dressing in haute couture? <br/><br/>As I watched over the next few years, I began to realize I was wrong...either that or the writers' plan backfired. Who was cool? It certainly wasn't Penny (whose last name has never been divulged). Don't get me wrong. I love the character and Kaley Cuoco has done a wonderful job with the evolutionary process. She began as a bright eyed ingenue with perfect, bobbed blond hair. An angel of sorts. It's been great fun to watch her grow more and more cynical and troubled as the years pass and her career stays stale and dormant. By and by, you notice she has a bit of an issue with turning to alcohol whenever things go wrong or a major snafu occurs. In spite of her big plan, and as the years pass, she is still waitressing or barkeeping at the Cheesecake Factory, and to date has only done a Prep H commercial, The Diary of Anne Frank over a noisy bowling alley, and worst of all, 2 cheezy sci-fi schlocks about genetically molested killer apes. <br/><br/>No wonder she depends on (more than she will admit) and loves (she'll never say it aloud) her faithful entourage of science loving dorks: Leonard Hofstadter (Johnny Galecki), an experimental laser physicist who has been head over heels for Penny since day one; Sheldon Cooper (Jim Parsons) the scarily genius, yet oddly childlike theoretical physicist whose quirks and neuroses force everyone around him to watch their every move carefully so as not to offend/traumatize him; the painfully lonely and shy Rajesh Koothrapalli (Kunal Nayyar), a celebrated astrophysicist whose inability to relate to women in a sober state has him almost as close to alcoholism as Penny; Howard Wolowitz (Simon Helberg), the tiny, over-confident, color-coordinated aerospace engineer whose lack of a PhD makes him the butt of Sheldon's jokes; Bernadette Rostenkowski (Melissa Rauch) the fierce, petite microbiologist with the chipmunk voice; Neurobiologist Amy Farrah Fowler (Mayim Bialik, brilliant!) the woman "chosen by science" to be Sheldon's mate, the frumpily dressed, limp- haired ultra-nerd who slowly becomes more and more delightful as she ingrains herself to the group; and Stuart Bloom (Kevin Sussman), the half-dead from depression owner of everyone's favorite comic book store.<br/><br/>Together, these "losers" daily navigate that big thing called life. Penny realizes she is most certainly not the "cool" one, and it is a great thing to hear a character who has had more sex than John Holmes say, "Sex is not what makes you grown up" to the virginal (not by choice) Amy. All of these people are extremely lovable. You may not understand all the physics jargon, but you understand they're human beings like you, and you root for them. For all their gifts, they are still confused and troubled and even broken. Leonard's mother (Christine Baranski) is a nightmare of a cold fish and has definitely left an imprint on her son; Howard's Dad disappeared when he was eleven and you'll get a look at the impact that made in an episode from season 7; Raj, again, is painfully lonely, the opposite of a person like myself who prefers solitude. He's had romance after romance fail on him. I was really hoping things would work with the weird little Lucy girl. Perhaps in the smart, somewhat kinky Emily, he will finally find happiness. Sheldon's Grandfather and father died when he was very young. In a very recent episode, a childhood idol of Sheldon's passes on, and it seems to trigger a sea change in him. As yet, he and Amy are still virgins. Leonard and Penny have finally decided to marry. So much change for a person who doesn't do well with even minor change. Sheldon finds himself at a crossroads by the finale of season 7.<br/><br/>Waiting for season 8..... I have been watching all type of TV series; starting from Sci-Fi to Drama, and Thriller to Comedy<br/><br/>I rank this TV series as NUMBER 1 in overall quality and entertainment; Period!<br/><br/>It is ingenious. Not in terms of science or anything else. It is because unique characters and how they play. They are all unique yet simple yet from life yet far from perfection yet being played imperfection. My and everybody's favorite character is Sheldon as the signature star and Penny comes as second as well. I think they are main pillars. Of course Leonard plays a critical role in balancing most of characters. Maybe he is the main pillar after all who knows. All others are just perfect as they are. <br/><br/>Just pick any episode from Season 1 to 7. You'll find the same taste and spirit in each and every episode. Sometimes funny, sometimes sad, sometimes emotional, but yet always smart, funny and yet relaxing somehow. Which makes it most re-watchable TV series of all times. <br/><br/>I wish I will continue in same way it was.. <br/><br/>Congratulations to all producers, writers, cast and every person contributes to this show. My favorite drama of all time was "24". To me, this is my "24" of comedy. "The Big Bang Theory" only took a season and a half to replace "Friends" as my #1 favorite comedy. I also discovered it during my second tour in Iraq, so I'm a little biased since this show made me forget where I was for 22 minutes per week.<br/><br/>The acting is beyond perfect. These actors ARE the characters they portray. The comedic timing is immaculate and the chemistry is flawless. Each character is given their own unique and completely believable quirks and it's easy to tell the actors look forward to going to work each week.<br/><br/>(Though, I must give an individual shout out to Jim Parsons. I apologize to the rest of the cast, who are irreplaceable in their own respects, but Sheldon makes the show. If it wasn't for him, then the others wouldn't likely have the same type of reactions to work with. His interactions create most of the laughs. Parsons is to "TBBT" what Ledger was to "The Dark Knight". Without him, I think it's unfortunately accurate to claim this show wouldn't be the success it is.)<br/><br/>The writing is the show, at the risk of sounding redundant. If it wasn't for the writing, the talented cast would have nothing to work with. The combination of the two makes it REALLY difficult to imagine these actors being as scientifically clueless in real life as Penny is in the show.<br/><br/>So much of "TBBT" is now part of pop culture, it's remarkable. It really has become this decade's answer to "Friends". <br/><br/>Also, if you get the chance to see the unaired, original pilot, please do. Hard-core fans will still enjoy it, and it will further enhance their appreciation of the show in its current form and direction. For the first 3 Series this is a great show. The premise of showing the geek take on the world from the inside is fantastic and is executed immaculately.<br/><br/>Series 4 starts to slide as they try and balance out the male bias of the show by bringing in additional female characters and giving the existing ones significantly more airtime.<br/><br/>Series 5 takes a sharp downhill. The introduction of additional female cast in Series 3 and 4 finally reaches critical mass and the whole show turns style into just being another relationship sitcom. In order to make a lot of the relationship jokes work they start throwing out fundamental character identities and historic plot points. Sheldon is obnoxious rather than eccentric, Raj is paranoid about racism to the point that he is being racist, Leonard is now a normal 'everyman' with none of the geek quality and Howard is just a cut and paste of Ross from friends.<br/><br/>And then it just goes further downhill from there. The writers continue to just make fun of Sheldon. And they are cutting out huge chunks of characterisation because they are simply too lazy to work within the set of rules they set for themselves. Clearing up Raj's mutism is the final straw for me, won't be watching next year. One can never believe but I have managed to start watching The Big Bang Theory only now, when Season 9 is at its full swing. My pals and colleagues told me to watch it long time ago, but I was oblivious to that. And than I did. Wow. Of all the serials that I watched in my life, this is perfectly The Best of all! I mean it. A sheer pleasure and a fountain of excellent gags, jokes, quips, anecdotes and real fun. And the cast! Many people like Sheldon Cooper. I dog Leonard and Penny - I follow their relation story with all my attention. And how I was deeply moved to tears when they got engaged! Such a sweet, hilarious and decent couple they are. But all the cast are great - Howard, Raj, Sheldon, Amy, Bernadette - they're all so cute and so endearingly good. So much has been written and said about this roller-coaster of a serial that I can only say - watch it. Watch all the episodes and have huge fun! Pure, clear, drunken fun. It is all so good! I wait now for a new episode and wish they'll go on strong further up the shiny path. Cheers to The Geek Heroes I love this programme so much, it is so funny and its really amusing with the things Sheldon comes out with. Its one of the best programmes I have seen and I am hoping they are going to carry this on over the next few years. But they should do more episodes where they go on road trips or something. Or it would be amazing if they made a film. If they made a film on The Big Bang Theory then it will be one of the funniest films of all time in my opinion. But the more the series go on the less they are nerds but that is what it was all about at the start of the series so they kind of drifted away from that idea. They also need to start adding more ideas into the show like more funny moments etc... Big Bang Theory is funny. There are other series that are more funny, more whatever, but it don't matter.<br/><br/>The concept is good, it is all about relationships - if you are a nerd you can identify yourself with one or more of the main actors. If you are like me, you will like most of the actors, understand their struggles with being nerds and understanding the world.<br/><br/>Also the concept of bringing in popular science fiction people appeal to many, though I find it a bit boring and the scenes too artificial.<br/><br/>The special gifts are the sprinkles on the cake. Like the slow-flake, star in space, napkin with signature, etc.<br/><br/>The many games that are played where the characters can reflect upon the real live while being in a virtual reality is good.<br/><br/>And if anything, there are too much focus on sex, and Sheldon's character go a bit too far in constructing his own world and take dominance. However, I am happy to see that the other figures also get their place in the spotlight. If there was no sex and relationship, I am sure most people would find it hard to enjoy for a longer time.<br/><br/>Relationships: In my opinion the best written dialogs and scenes are between Sheldon and Penny - Penny learn from Sheldon and he from her - and if it wasn't because Leonard is married to Penny, I would like Sheldon and Penny to end up like a couple.<br/><br/>Sheldon and Amy. It got boring very fast - too nerdy in the relationship. I guess that is why the produces turned Amy from the geek into a woman with needs and love for Sheldon - it didn't work out with 2 super geeks.<br/><br/>Raj and Howard. It was fun with the gay-jokes, but over time worn out. Luckily they both start to have relationships and particular Howard's figure have developed a lot.<br/><br/>Howard and Sheldon, always tense - Sheldon is self-centered and always think he is better than others - but it tend to be boring the 100'th and 1000'th time that he insult Howard.<br/><br/>Howard and Bernadette, OK, but not really funny, Bernadette help to develop Hoards figure, but well - not so funny.<br/><br/>Leonard and Penny: It was a relationship to carry part of the series, and well written. Partly funny, partly serious, like a miniseries inside the series itself. It has however, not been as funny as the Penny+Sheldon relationship.<br/><br/>A few negatives that pull down the series: Laughter soundtrack. I can ignore it, but I know many can't. Drop it. Cut down Sheldons attitude. I know he is horrible and drives all to insanity, but I suggest to develop the personality and that he start to understand that he is not the center of the universe - he need to wake up in one way or another. At first, I thought ' The Big Bang Theory ' was no more than an ordinary show. But no, I was wrong ! I just watched one episode of some season of The Big Ban Theory and wow I loved it. Then I started watching from Season 1 and watched all the seasons. It's always humorous :) Now as for Season 9, it's good. The first two episodes weren't that great ! The third episode was good , though. I guess BBT is slowly losing it's them. Nevertheless, I hope the directors do something about it. I'm sure they can ! Now as for the actors, THEY ARE THE BEST. Especially Sheldon's character who is portrayed by Jim Parsons. Oh My God, he is just the best. There's no one like him who can act in such a lucid way ! And the others are good too ! So if want to watch a comedy show that'll make you laugh till you die ( exaggeration, :D ) , watch this ! It is a show that can be repeated.<br/><br/>In movies, there are qualities that is so good, people would re-watched it. In TV shows, this kind of feat is as high as the mount Everest. Imagine repeating episodes, contributing hours for completion so it is understandable. More so, when episodes can vary. Some are better than others.<br/><br/>A feat quite achieved, if not owned, by this TV show.<br/><br/>Well defined characters, including the introduced guests. There are arcs and in this, the lessons learned, encounters made are imprinted in their individuality, their values, and most importantly, the evolution each stories in every episodes makes as they, the stories, wrap themselves to each and every characters. This evolution I'm talking about, like well accomplished scientist, is what made me attracted on this show, contrary to other comedy TV shows.<br/><br/>The gang.<br/><br/>Leonard is the catalyst of the group, as I remember it said on the show. He is the sensible part of the group. Kind of.<br/><br/>penny is a slut. Though takes a gradual changes along the way, for the better.<br/><br/>Cooper is the uber nerd. Narcissistic that pales psychotic murderers. As said before, Dr. Cooper as well will take a transformation, though its kind of painstakingly slow. He is what I believe the butt of most of the jokes on the show. You'd think people would feel sorry for this guy, but after you watch the series, you'd discover it's the most common thing in the world, freeing you of any pity you might feel for him.<br/><br/>Howard has a bit of an interest in the opposite gender. Best friends with Kutrapoli. Bro-mance. He is like the blond guy in how I met your mother, the one who always ends with bed in them girls, no matter how unreasonable this encounters are, but in this show, bbt, Howard is like the undead, no matter how women tries to stab him with their rejections, as he tries to hit on them with some ways nobody could possibly imagine. Like the previous three, he will improve his character/values, though for comical relief, glacier slow.<br/><br/>kotrapoli (spelling might be incorrect) can't talk to women. usually mistaken as gay by his parents and the world except for the people mention in this review. In the five, I think he has made the best improvement. A great change suitable even for a season finale. Misunderstood as he is a foreigner from India.<br/><br/>Now, imagine them staying the same building and you'd get a riot and uncountable laughs for those that has enough holds on their chairs as they try not to fall off in the first scene.<br/><br/>ps. now going strong for the upcoming season 9 burp! I love this show I cannot wait for Season 8 to come out on DVD because I own and have seen Seasons 1-7 like five times the actors are great the storyline plot is incredible the comedy is perfect I love Chuck Lorre they come up with such good storyline plots I wish that this show would never end it is defiantly my favorite show of all time! So if you have not checked it out yet or seen it go down to Best buy or something and pick the first couple seasons and you will instantly be hooked and addicted! Just trust me on that. It is a great funny perfect show for teens ad adults. You will love it I promise you that and if you don't something is wrong with you :) I love sit-com. I really enjoy and having a relax time after my all day work with this series. This movie is so "clever comedy" esp. the character Sheldon Cooper. All character is very geek in his/her own way but Penny is only one character is so difference from everyone she's don't know anything about science but she's still be the one in the geek group. they are truly mate. It makes a plot more complicated. The The best sit-com TV series for me. The story line, plot, character and everything is so "perfect to match". <br/><br/>First time I saw the title and read summery of this series but I didn't want to pay attention and waste my time for this TV series because of "science" things. But I have an opportunity to watch at my friend's home by 1 episode and I have to say l am a fan of this TV series. I am addicted. I love this show. Have watched it from season one and have always enjoyed it. I strongly disagree with the negative comments about bringing on Amy and Bernadette. I hate it when writers in a lot of shows never let characters relationships last more then a couple of months. It's a little more realistic when shows progress as they would in real life. I did like Amy better though the way she was in the beginning. When she was first introduced to the show she was just a female version of Sheldon and thought just like he did about sex and relationships. Now they are making her character more like the others. I would also like to see them soften Sheldon up a little. I love his character's personality and gawkiness, but does he have to be so rude to make it work. Also I hope Raj and his girlfriend stay together. I first saw this show in a flight to LA in 2008. I am very glad that I did. Since then, I have watched this show as if my life depended on it. The dialogue is intelligent, filled with physics theories and application. Some of the pun and jokes may not be entirely understood by someone who has not taken intro to physics in college. However, even for those of us less scientifically inclined, the show has much to offer. The dynamics between the highly intellectual vs. the socially developed, this show sheds light on the small, but highly influential, nerd population in the states. <br/><br/>One thing, I've noticed is that the band of four physicists are less friends than one might think at first. But why exactly do they stay together? Perhaps, because there have no other friends, or maybe they just don't understand social protocol. Penny, our average girl next door, brings some "normalcy" to the show. But often her responses to the extravagant physics are a bit too stupid. Nonetheless, the show is entertaining. <br/><br/>The jokes are getting a bit cheap over time, and the plot is starting to drag. The writers need to either add more characters and some new serious scenario if they want to make another successful season. The first season of The big bang theory was great! one of the best series I ever seen.<br/><br/>But season 2 do not have what nr1 had. It feels like second season keeps going repeat, same joke, different setting. Sheldon's wired behavior is just funny for so long, you can't keep the whole episode with just Sheldon humor. And when finally something funny comes up, it loses its touch.<br/><br/>I don't know the view stats, but I think if season 3 is to come, the writers has to do a better job!<br/><br/>. I am not one for sitcoms, and that was something which held me back from following The Big Bang Theory(TBBT) for quite a long time. But continuous pestering from a few friends and colleagues caused me to give it a try. <br/><br/>Once you understand the concept of the show (and have an understanding of scientific/technical jargon), you would be hooked to it. The contrast between the lives of the nerds and that of Penny is something which creates generous dollops of humor throughout the span of 8 seasons.<br/><br/>Although the recorded laughs tend to get a little too much at times, yet, it is easily overpowered by the witty nature of Howard Wolowitz or the socially inept Sheldon Cooper or the oh, so lovable, Penny.<br/><br/>I already feel sad thinking that this show might be ended in 2016/2017. But until then, don't miss it guys, go for it. One of the greatest(read:most lovable) shows made ever. This is a problem of a lot of sit-coms out there right now (or, it might be a problem of my own, you be the judge of that). The first, let's say 2 seasons, the show was hilarious, I can hardly count the times I burst out laughing. <br/><br/>After that, it gets tricky. The jokes are becoming so obvious: oh, yeah, that was funny cause, you know, Sheldon is crazy - you're in my spot. Hah, weirdo. OK, so Howard is the horny one with the yelling mother. And don't forget poor Leonard, trying to fit into the normal world. <br/><br/>Seems like I've reached a point where the show has nothing more to offer. In the attempt to bring something refreshing, the writers came up with the character of Amy. Well, although she has her moments, they do not come often enough. And the rest of the time she is just a female Sheldon (at least in the aspect of social interaction) pushing it too hard which is annoying. <br/><br/>In conclusion, I decided to change my rating down from 8.5 to 6. Like I said, the start was great, during the 4th season I caught myself thinking "same old, same old". A lame attempt at comedy. How I Met Your Mother is much better than this. And it doesn't even compare with the F.R.I.E.N.D.S. Poor written dialogues. Poor written storyline. Would have given a 0 star if there was an option. Really bad series, what is actually funny? Bad jokes with fake laughtar allt the time. I don't understand how people find this watchable Classic. Does everything every other series do nowadays. Not even the sentimental value stick with this one. Uck I finally decided to watch it after some ppl around me started telling me it's better than friends. N even though it's pretty obvious that this show isn't even 10% of what Friends was, I still liked the first three seasons, they were good, not friends good but good. Then they brought in all these girls...as if Penny wasn't irritating enough already! N then they made it to the same cliche relationship drama like some cheap indian soap. Plus all those laugh tracks in the background make it more unbearable than it already is...its like telling ppl something funny has been said...lol. Friends background laugh was actually to the point n it was like laughing with other ppl cuz u Actually laughed.
Nothing about this show is great, except Sheldon's acting n dialogue deliveries. N last but not the least, I could have given it 6stars if there was no Penny in the show. Never seen a character such poorly written n executed in any tv show that it makes u wanna hate them. Funniest show on tv! I'll miss this terribly ðŸ˜« at least we have young Sheldon Naturally, as a comedy series with more than 20 seasons you will find some episodes that aren't really that good, but after watching it all I can say that on average, most episodes are above the curve and make you have a lot of fun. This show is hilarious in every way shape or form.<br/><br/>The cast are fantastic and they have a chemistry that you don't see in many sitcoms today.<br/><br/>Like every television sitcom, there are some episodes which are not great. Thankfully there have not being many in 12 seasons, which shows you how capable the writers are.<br/><br/>Over the years we have seen each character grow and mature. This seems to be a point of contention with some fans as they think this has ruined the show.<br/><br/>Let me tell you that is hasn't and each and every character is still loveable up until now and back when the original episode aired.<br/><br/>There are plenty of smart laughs in the show. Some you have to be a big fan of pop culture in general, as well as science. But don't let that stand in the way of you having a laugh.<br/><br/>It's sad that this show is coming to end as I don't know what else which is incredibly funny to watch to take its place. The spin off Young Sheldon is also fantastic to watch and that is a very happy replacement to keep watching once Big Bang ends I love Big Bang theory, the writers are geniuses, although I wish this show lasted for a full hour rather than just 30 min. I also really like that over the years the show has turned from being fully focused on just Sheldon and all the other cast were just supporting actors to merging into having all 7 as the main character, by far hands down way better than young Sheldon, to me all main 7 make the show not just fun to watch but a wanting to connect with each of them. I also really like that for the most part the show doesn't try to force their networks political views down the viewers throats like 98% of the other shows on television. We had the show recommended to us from multiple sources but resisted during a time with less viewing time available. Now retired we started watching from season one. Have watched all episodes and started over again. Viewing the second time through was still a laugh every scene. We like the later season episodes as well as the early ones. A wonderful ensemble of cast members deliver a well written show every episode. I have to admit, the first time i watched a couple of episodes i wasn't really hooked on the show and the show was already in its fifth season. it took me a while to warm up a little and then i started loving this show with all those characters with their individual quirks and personality. i think everyone can find something in one of those characters they can relate to. and it got a lot of heart and soul too. you really feel for the characters when something is happening to them. the only comedy show which i would rate higher in recent years would be "how i met your mother" because its quality remained constantly at a very high level. "The Big Bang Theory" however lost a little bit since they all got girlfriends and even married. that changes a lot of the things they do on the show and although its still a lot of fun its not as good as the first 4 or 5 seasons. So how would i rate this show? the first couple of seasons would definitely give a 9/10. but the last ones are more of an 8/10 and the tenth season is maybe a 7/10.<br/><br/>*spoiler* Especially in the tenth season things start to repeat itself to a point where you really get bored. Let Amy and Sheldon have a normal sex life already. give Raj a new Girlfriend or bring back Lucy. I really liked her. How about give Penny a new Movie Audition which she gets and she starts changing because of she is really an actress now and that could stir up their relationship i a lot of different ways like being insecure again it was the right choice since she is finally a star. not being how to much, flying around, meeting other people and stuff. there might be a lot of potential still left. *spoiler off*<br/><br/>anyway not matter what. if they continue to move slowly like they did the last couple of years with about everything i probably stop watching after the tenth season and start rewatching the first couple of seasons. thats always a good way to determine if a show still got it. just go back to the first season and compare. most shows are never able to keep that high quality throughout the years I love this show. Its funny and smart and maintains a good story line. Most shows like this pander to their audience as if they won't be able to follow the trains of thought. This show manages to find viewers and connect at all levels.<br/><br/>Jim Parsons does an amazing job playing Sheldon and I really like how the typical guy's girl isn't always the most desirable woman on the show. Sometimes brains win out over beauty! <br/><br/>Most of all though, I feel like The Big Bang Theory really gets that the show is not about them being nerdy, it just takes place in the apartment building of the nerds. Despite the crazy situations and, yes, the sometimes over the top nerd-speak, the show manages to touch something human and really relate to these characters. I must admit when The Big Bang Theory first came over to the UK I wasn't very interested in it but a couple of years ago I got my hands on all the seasons and once I started I couldn't stop. I hope it never ends.<br/><br/>I know nothing of physics or science in general but this doesn't matter as the characters are so engaging and lovable. I find in most TV series there is a character you love or hate, this won't happen with this show as you will love them all.<br/><br/>In summary a very simple message, watch it and you will love it. End of! I believe everything that has to be said has already been written about this sitcom. It is well written and funny.<br/><br/>But I am truly disappointed they threw Aarti Mann out of the cast.<br/><br/>The reason is very simple, she made KC look like even less sophisticated than she really is.<br/><br/>The girl, Cuoco, has no posture, no elegance... and nothing that could make me take her to my parents and admit that she is my girlfriend. Melissa Rauch would have been a much better choice for the leading female character if they wanted a blond so badly).<br/><br/>Aarti Mann is far more feminine and intelligent than all the other females to appear on this show, and I miss her.<br/><br/>Aside the fact that Cuoco is blonde, and has good physical attributes, she is no match for Mann, whom I hope to see very soon somewhere else on a BIG SILVER SCREEN. I was excited when i saw that Chuck Lorre was making a new show and it was going to be about "nerds". And i watched a few episodes...actually i saw 2 seasons, but now i can't stand it. All it is is oneliners and Sheldon explaining something simple, but in an overly complicated way. And every now and then, he fails to understand regular social behavior. To me this is not humor. This is a simple and repetitive, filled with stereotype characters and topics that has already been used in basically every other sitcom ever. There is however a way this could be an awesome show...if Leonard killed Sheldon in the last episode. This would make everything credible, I would have... I despise Big Bang Theory (tv show) for the following reasons. It is:<br/><br/>1) Uninteresting 2) Unimpressive 3) Heavily chauvinistic 4) Awkward 5) Imprecise 6) Unamusingly stereotypical 7) Provided with a retarded laugh track 8) Which does nothing but emphasize its retarded jokes 9) Which implies that Chuck Lorre underestimates the wit of its presumingly "nerdy" audience 10) "But the audience isn't just nerds!" Then I believe BBT is nothing but a mockery of a certain category of people; I trust that even the dumbest individual would see how ridiculing this show is. Let alone the fact that its creator, the aforenamed Mr. Chuck Lorre, is the same shallow person of influence who brought us Two And A Half Men, disintegrating all the respect I used to have for Ashton Kutcher after his memorable performance in That 70's Show.<br/><br/>Talking about the cult comedy That 70's Show was, it proved how reasonable the creation of a "nerdy" character can be, see Eric Forman, the most amazing Star Wars fan in comedy history. Eric Forman constantly talks about Star Wars, yet manages to be more renovating than the meme-like references featured in BBT. Holy Jedediah, the references are so many, it's like listening to a little boy dressed as a pirate who just learned about the internet and spills out everything he has discovered like vomit, flooding my mind with "You Don't Say?"s. There is no doubt that other characters like George Michael from Arrested Development and Manny Delgado/Luke Dunphy make better burn-outs than Sheldon, Leonard, Howard, Rajesh & co.<br/><br/>All in all, I wonder what is so witty and entertaining in this television series, in order for it to be rated 8.7 on IMDb. I had left a review about this show a few months ago. I can't find it in my feed or under the movie's review either. I guess my review offended the 99%.<br/><br/>
Anyways in BBT the humour is really stale and the use this overdone laugh track after every single sentence even when there was nothing funny said.<br/><br/>I suggest you watch on YouTube the big bang theory without laugh track to see my point.<br/><br/>They got cheesey characters even for geek standards. They were no where near Steve Urkels power level.<br/><br/>The show lasted 1 episode way too long. Let's hope it does not resurrect or comes with a spinoff in the future.<br/><br/>Now let's hope that this review sticks this time. This has to be one of the most overated tv shows in our short history of television. I cant understand why so many people like it. Well actually i can its because the average american is dumber then ever. The entire show is set up as a joke on the audience. The premise of these nerds being some of the smartest people around makes viewers feel like they are smart by watching yet the characters almost never espouse wisdom they litterally make fart jokes and childish sexual innuendos that may make a teen laugh but should not make adults lagh. I implore you to go and watch an episode without the laugh tracks. Its the most ridiculous thing iv ever witnessed theres actually almost as much laugh track as there is actual commentary. Iv tried on many occasions to watch this show because my parents both love it and watch it religiously but everytime i try its the same thing, stupid one liner, laugh track another one liner, another laugh track. I really fear for future generations when i see tv shows like this being lauded as emmy worthy and whatever other praise is heaped on this pile. Theres nothing wrong with watching mindless tv but if your goin to watch trash tv it should at least actually be funny When I first saw it I hated it I thought it was going to suck and I felt like it was slow and crap. But after a while I was getting into it I watched them all and I fele that it had a good run. One cant imagine of some science freaks AKA Nerds having so much fun What would have been real original and fun to watch would have been if Bernadette had chosen to stay at home and raise her baby. She is an intelligent scientist, so it would have been nice to see a show where a smart mom chooses to raise her baby and bring it up in a way where it is emotionally secure, happy and allowed to be curious about the world. Instead they use the lazy, socially irresponsible daycare trope. Sad! The rest of the show has always pleased me and made me laugh. This was disappointing. I can never get bored watching the Big Bang theory. I know the characters are 'maturing' but that is normal because people do just that and the last season is as entertaining as the first. Loved every season It's difficult for me to real laugh soundly with a sitcom for many years.
Sheldon, Leonard and the theam maked me laugh again until i can't stop :) First of all I recommened this show for everyone..This show has been amazing since the first episode.. As a super-hero and science nerd i enjoyed how the presented the "geek world" and the contrast with Penny.. But I am also happy that characters changed through the seasons.. If Sheldon remained the same emotionless geek person without feelings or needs for communication, friends and more that would mean that Penny had no impact on him.. I still enjoy the show and the only thing that was sad for me is that Leonard and Sheldon are no longer roomates.. That's the only thing I think they did wrong.. I like the character development of Sheldon and Amy.. Also I love how the other main character just added things to their character.. Leonard is still insecure little guy who gets angry with Sheldon.. Penny is still the girl who doesn't know anything about Science or Geek Movies and Comic Books.. Howard is still the funny and creepy-flirting guy and Raj is still the one who has problem at communicating with woman (now he talks but he is still afraid and says wrong stuff).. Sheldon is still the person who doesn't get sarcasm and feelings and enjoys science and comics and geek stuff.. They didnt change who they are, they just developed based on that.. The big bang theory is the typical American series with a light and silly sense of humor. The series uses the nerd ingenuity and scientific data to relate the occurrences of a group of freaks friends. The characters are really well defined and it becomes a great entertainment option if what we want is to hang out. Sometimes the series turns monotonous because of the continuous topics that it develops, however it catches the interest of many viewers with the unique personalities of the characters.The most funny and attractive feature of this show is that this is truly how these kind of boys behave, act, and even live. When you mix people like these with a snobby, sexy girl; funny things can occur. I had heard good things about this show for quite a while before I ever decided to give it a chance, but after I had finally started watching it I was severely disappointed. The show has very flat characters that fit into typical archetypes, and don't go far beyond that. A lot of the jokes are clever, but it is rare to find one that is actually worth a laugh. The show relies too heavily on the awkward interactions between the characters, and seems to assume that putting a laugh track on the end of every sentence will make the jokes funnier. The show was enjoyable for a while, but the lack of depth and good humour make it easy for the show to get tiring. The characters are also easily worn out, and the only thing keeping them going is that the show makes it seem like they're better than they are via laugh tracks and other cheap devices. THE BIG BANG THEORY â€“ Season 1 'The Big Bang Theory' ('Big Bang' for short) is an American sitcom that charts the lives of four Caltech scientists: roommates, Leonard Hofstadler (Johnny Galecki) and Sheldon Cooper (Jim Parsons) plus their work colleagues Howard Wolowitz (Simon Helberg) and Raj Koothrappali (Kunal Nayyar). In addition the main cast is rounded off by Kaley Cuoco who plays Penny, a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory.<br/><br/>Since the end of 'Friends' there is been a huge number of American sitcoms of debatable quality, fortunately Big Bang does not suffer from this, and is instead a refreshingly inventive sitcom, though does make its viewers suffer through 'canned' laughterÂ… Nevertheless, it is worth putting up with as this first season provides many laugh-out-loud moments and some truly hilarious episodes! Indeed Big Bang features some fantastic script writing, with jokes based around the nerd and geek culture embraced by Leonard, Sheldon, Howard, and Raj, but never attacking said culture. Thus, instead of making its characters look like 'losers', Big Bang embraces its characters and makes this sitcom have a lot of heart which tends to be missing from most sitcoms.<br/><br/>Much of the comedy is centred on science, sci-fi, comic books and gaming, and thus feels relatively fresh as this content is not frequently used in comedy. Indeed, the jokes hit home for all ages, so whether or not you know the difference between Star Trek and Star Wars there are plenty of witticisms for viewers. Yet, as with all comedy shows not all the jokes 'work' but, with Big Bang, the humour mostly performs well.<br/><br/>As well as possessing excellent writing and humour the show also boasts a great group of actors who do justice to the writers. Indeed, writing is only as good as it is delivered and in Big Bang this is excellent. Likewise, there seems to be a great balance and chemistry to the main cast with each character feeling distinct and three-dimensional. Of the five main cast members though, Kunal Nayyar and Jim Parsons really stand out. Kunal Nayyar proves himself an excellent physical comedy actor, whilst Jim Parsons is a tour de force as Sheldon Cooper, stealing most scenes with his fascinating performances. Not wanting to spoil your fun, all I shall say is that Sheldon is a reason on its own to watch this show! <br/><br/>Ultimately, this show succeeds because it pairs a talented group of actors with a gifted crop of writers, and thus makes it more than just 'another sitcom'. Big Bang offers a great selection of comedy and also has a big heart, which makes for an outstanding first season. The Big Bang Theory has raised the bar for sitcoms, and is well worth buying. This is by far one of the greatest television shows I've seen. It contains humor, wit, and intelligence and is a must see for anyone! My nerdy bf loves it, my conservative mother gets the biggest kick out of Sheldon, and everyone I meet has seen it and liked it. I thought after the 5th season it was going to taper off and to be honest I got bored for a couple episodes, but I was pleasantly surprised to find they picked up the pace and the show and the character development continues to amaze me. Sheldon is my favorite character, he may be quirky, but his character brings something fun, weird, and annoying to the show and television. Everyone should at least watch an episode! Its great! The Big Bang Theory is one of the GREATEST, AWESOMENESS show on television. I love it. I first watched was the episode when they are making Penny Blossoms. I watched it at my Grandma's and I laughed my head off and could NOT stop! Sheldon is one my my many favourite characters! He is smart in physics but does not get outside life unlike Penny (the women who moves in next door) is the complete opposite. Leonard is Sheldon's roommate who has a on-off relationship with Penny but is a smart, witty guy who puts up with Sheldon along with his friends, Howard, who still lives with his mother and is Jewish and Raj, a guy from India, cannot speak to women (only if he's drunk) and is questioning his sexuality. Amy, who was first introduced to the show when Howard and Raj signed Sheldon up for a dating site, was a girl who was Sheldon's friend but is now his girlfriend and Bernadette, who Howard met though his pact with Leonard, is now marrying Howard. Priya is Raj's sister and has a lot to do with the show in the 3rd season when she is dating Leonard. Its is now finished its 5th season in Australia and I can't wait till' its 6th. Please keep on putting Big Bang Theory on!!! BBT 4 life!! johnny galeki is a whiny "cool geek" clichÃ©. kelly cuoco makes a lemon sucking face every time she tells a joke while waiting for the canned laughter and has no real comedic feel. the Indian and Jewish stereotypes are done to death and ultimately boring. miyam bialik is occasionally very funny, and knowing that she's a lesbian irl adds a layer to some of the comedy. jim parsons, of course, is hilarious, and the one bright spot on the show, despite having no real material to work with. basically, it's a typical chuck lorre odd-couple clichÃ©. tired, trite, clichÃ©d, hackneyed, predictable, and a complete waste of talent. charlie sheen may be a lunatic, but let's face it: everything lorre touches is predigested pap. there's also no actual science to speak of, although that's not really that big of a deal, just a little disappointing. if it wasn't for jim parsons, it would be completely unwatchable. as is, it will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth if you have anything approaching a sense of humor or brain. The Big Bang Theory is a great comedy sitcom which many will enjoy. I watched it since the beginning and I loved it all the way throughout the 5 seasons! Sheldon, Leonard, Raj and Howard are the four key players in this sitcom, but Penny, Bernadette and Amy have also grown as significant figures in this sitcom. I think that overall, the underlying reason behind the huge audience that this sitcom has gathered throughout the years is because it portrays the life of a common man and many can relate to them. Plus there's the inner nerd in all of us that enjoys anime, cartoons and such. I give this show 10/10 because every episode that I watch is full of laughter and fun. Coming up with an original sitcom idea is definitely a huge challenge. TBBT presents us a pretty much recycled idea, with a new glare. I guess you could compare it to an interesting song cover. No matter how pleasing, it still is in its essence something we'we seen or heard before. And I mean long before. A couple of awkward guys forced to make contact with a beautiful woman must be one of the most used comedic situations ever. Forming another group like this and adding a bunch of science terms in order to further establish the awkwardness of the characters themselves is a bit disturbing because it in fact once again demonstrates what we'we always known: in a world we live in being smart makes you "socially challenged". From what I have figured out the main character should have been Leonard, but since Sheldon proved to be much more interesting, the show's focus translated to him. You can pretty much consider it a logical choice, since Sheldon is in fact one of the most interesting characters in sitcoms ever. Highly intelligent, but socially unpleasant characters have always been potentially very popular. Currently, two of the most dominating TV characters possess this kind of appeal: Gregory House and Sheldon Cooper, each with his own extra attractiveness. Sheldon is even crazier than House, but somehow it doesn't make him less plausible for the majority of the viewers. Other characters in the show are not that great, but simply serve as a supporting cast for Sheldons antics. In fact, I have met people who actually believe the shows title is "Sheldon". This striking difference between the level of the popularity of main characters is something the Friend's creators successively avoided. Unfortunately, TBBT mostly proves to be a one man show, with Sheldon displaying every possible negative quality that an average person believes brilliant physicists posses, while the rest of the crew simply deliver clichÃ©d sentences, designed to provoke Sheldons not so unique madness. Not to be mistaken, not even him is something we might call "an original character" but he's entertaining enough to make me indifferent to this problem. Well, since most of the people don't even think this is a problem, the shows success is quite predictable, as most of the things concerning this sitcom. Nevertheless, you should still be able to enjoy it, if you find a way to cope with it's lack of originality. Unfortunately, lack of originality is one of the biggest problems in the entertainment industry at the moment, while the world of science and technology that Sheldon and his colleagues inhabit is exactly the opposite. If we can't have both, I guess this is for the better. Real Sheldons out there, please don't get insulted by certain show's premises, and keep up with the work, so that the rest of us could laugh at the stereotypical portrayals of you as much as we did till now. OK, we know you're not insane, but would you let our stupid minds be entertained with the same kind of stereotypes you had to live with for years? Geeks and pretty women - always an interesting combination I absolutely love this show. Sheldon's humor is so dry, yet hilarious at the same time.Theme song was the first thing that hooked me up to this show.This show represents the fun side of geeks. The really funny plot and the fact that it has comic, movie and video game references make it a great show for teens also...And you don't have to be a genius to see that observation is half of the fun. Moreover Sheldon's BAZINGA's and Howard's YEESSS MAAAAAAAA!!!!! Make you laugh every time!!!! Overall, a great show, and one of the few good shows that has everything I like. May the force be with you:) Addictive is a good sum up of this show.. but the show has gotten somewhat worse since season 1.<br/><br/>I have watched every episode to date and I noticed even between episode 1 and 2 a change in character, especially Sheldon whom in episode 1, season 1, understands AND is sarcastic.<br/><br/>What really bothers me is the laugh-track that another reviewer mentioned. They say laughing is contagious, but to a certain degree. A bad joke is still a bad joke, there is no amount of laughter that can negate this fact.<br/><br/>I've read a few reviews that hasn't really given the show a fair chance. A few reviews think that Sheldon is a horrible character (I think Jim Parsons is a really great job portraying this character) but I think you need to start at season 1 to get a good comprehension of what kind of a character Sheldon is and see the growth he does as a character.<br/><br/>Penny is a good opposite character (can't find a good synonym for "opposite character") compared to the guys but something from season 1 and 2 has gone missing and I can't put my finger on what that is. I recommend watching seasons 1 and 2, 3 and 4 are optional.<br/><br/>Overall, I will keep watching this show but I hope it gets better from now on. I love this show, but the plot can be a little bad sometimes.<br/><br/>Examply S02 E03, where Penny is talking to Sheldon, he keeps saying "Sheldor (the Conquer) is AFK" even though he still has his laptop on his legs, which is making him still being at the keyboard, and he also says: "That girl needs to get a life", that is just stupidly said by a person who plays more than her.<br/><br/>I like the acting and the characters, but the plot is not that well made.<br/><br/>I hope they will continue the show though. This is one of my favorite shows, just next to House. Big Bang Theory first caught my interest since it was created by Chuck Lorre,one of the creators of my favorite among still-running sitcoms,the brilliant one-and-only "Two and a half men".A lot of people recommended "Big Bang Theory" so I thought I'd give it a try. The characters are,of course,created around popular stereotypes,somewhat more aimed towards a younger audience than the more mature "Two and a half men".<br/><br/>The plot evolves around four incredibly intelligent but geeky physicists who spend most of their free time playing WoW or watching SciFi-series,of course.They know next to nothing about how to attract women or even talk to them and when Penny,a cute blonde,cheer-leader-type girl moves in across the hall,they encounter a new perspective of life they know very little about.Sex. They are neurotic,thin and obsessive-compulsive(as over-intelligent people often are in fiction-world).At least Sheldon is,who to begin with show very little interest in things outside his area of expertise.Wolowitz is not really the neurotic type and he is also more outgoing than the rest of the bunch,but has somewhat overestimated his capabilities with the opposite sex.Worst off in the relationship area is Nayyar who goes completely silent in the presence of women.Wolowitz and Leonard are the gems in the cast,in my opinion.<br/><br/>Over all,TBBT is obviously a show with potential.The exaggerated stereotypes are sometimes a bit overdone,but I suppose it's nearly inevitable in a sitcom.I can live with that and still find it worth watching. Some things in the supposedly geeky look puzzles me,for instance would probably their taste in clothes be considered more hip than geeky in real life.<br/><br/>Give it a try if you haven't already,I believe the show will grow over time. I must start off by saying that Sheldon Cooper has been one of the most vital characters since the beginning of the show. I have to give credit to Jim Parsons where credit is due. 
 That being said, as the show has evolved with Leonard marring Penny, Wallowitz marrying Bernadette & having 2 kids, Raj still needing to find his true love, besides Cinnamon, & Stuart having a more active role & just getting a girlfriend, we don't necessarily need Sheldon in the show for it to still be a Big Bang Hit! Of course it's up to the producers if they want to keep the character Amy Farrah Fowler yet it can be done. 
 Many shows have had one of the main characters either take a job at another university or they can always so that Sheldon, and/or Amy are in Europe expanding Sheldon's profession. Jim Parson can either do a cameo every once in while on Skype or Amy can, or Leorard can pretend he's Skyping with Sheldon & Penny can pretend she's Skyping with Amy. 
 There are many ways to play this, keep the ratings high & NOT CANCEL "THE BIG BANG THEORY" JUST CAUSE JIM PARSONS WANTS OUT!!!
 ~Keisha Spitsen For the nerd in us. As it involves around two young men with PHDs. Played with both wit and charm by Johnny Galecki aka Leonard and Sheldon played by scene stealing Jim Parsons.<br/><br/>Penny played by Kaley Cuoco is the more common sense and more outgoing who tries to give the two geeks a life. Besides just staying in the room and working despite being smart. They are more book smart compared to Penny being a bit of street smart.<br/><br/>Despite trying to be an actress but having no success unlike the men of the show. But that is what makes the show click. Due to the awarkness of the men and the street smart common sense of the women.<br/><br/>Great support by Simon Helberg, Kunal Nayyar, and Mayam Balik of "Blossom" fame among the great support staff. Great writing and great acting. Also notice it has a laugh track on the show! The story of 4 geeks who have women thrown into their life. When the show first started, it had just 1 girl, but now the whole show has become about how these Geeks try to cope with relationships. I guess it was a natural progression, but I enjoyed it much more when it was just the guys together who were nervous around girls. Now, every guy needs to have some relationship drama. The real travesty though is Raj, who I thought was the funniest one on the show, but is being led down a road of bas writing and a boring relationship storyline.<br/><br/>The show is well acted and at least, for the most part, keeps an interesting story line. However, it is obvious that the show is going to end with Leonard and Penny getting married, but probably with the inevitably of Penny breaking up with Leonard for 2-3 episodes and being confused, before getting back with him.<br/><br/>Writing has just really gone downhill with comedies. I feel like CBS has some sort of corporate policy that all their shows must go a certain way. This show is probably more like a 6.5-7 but I mistakenly gave How I met your mother5-6 stars and that show is awful, so I'm over compensating because this all is problems, Big Bang Theory is twice as well written and funny as that show Originally, I was thinking that this show was off-putting. The nerd factor didn't really speak to me, and I'm never a fan of pandering. However, I always try to give a show at least a two episode test. The more episodes that I watched, the more hooked I was. Pretty soon I came to an impressive realization. You see, normally I give a series a two episode test because there's no such thing as a series that doesn't have a single bad episode. So it seemed the only way to give a series a fair shake was to watch at least two episodes of it. What I discovered as I watched more and more episodes of this show was that, not only do I love ALL the episodes, but it seems that this series has achieved that Olympian task of making every episode a good one! The characters are all unique. The story is hilarious. The situations draw from real and surreal in such a way that both merge together so seamlessly that you get sucked right into its fictional world. Have to say that this show would be at a loss without the character of Sheldon (especially when interacting with Penny). Thankfully, it does not appear that we will have to see a Big Bang Theory without this cornerstone character. However, should that change, I fear that my opinion might as well.

Check out more here: http://bit.ly/TVOTB_imdb A complete hailirus comedy show .Binge watching show TV comedy just doesn't get any better than this. I could write volumes on why this show is so good, but others have already done it, and if you watch it, you'll have those same reasons and more.<br/><br/>Probably the most telling thing for me personally is that I'm an old guy relic straight out of the World War II era . . . yes, a geek, but still an old guy. So what the hey would an old guy find funny in this modern, young person humor? Ans: Everything. Just enough socially challenged throughout my life to really relate to the awkward efforts of these male social pariah, e.g., Stewart as he has dinner . . . with . . . a cat . . . that isn't even his cat. In reality, most guys are basically quite shy despite all the macho bluster trying to prove otherwise.<br/><br/>For one thing, the humor is timeless. Just racy enough to keep both sexes interested, just off-the-wall enough to be real, really real. And anyone who doesn't find Penny perfectly sexy, appealing and attractive for her role, doesn't appreciate pretty, sexy young women.<br/><br/>Clearly the show has a fantastic staff of writers, but the ensemble cast IS the magic, a once in a lifetime group. The characters seem real, with hearts, e.g., as much as Sheldon would annoy anyone, his willingness to loan/give Penny a large amount of money because "she needed it and he didn't" was fundamental in establishing him as a "good person".<br/><br/>As one of the very first family members to tune in this comedy in its first season, I take pride it knowing that I introduced them to it, turning them into raving fans also, but I can still distinctly remember them initially saying, "What's so funny?" (BTW, I watched "M*A*S*H for the first time in re-runs!) In so many shows the premise basically amounts up to a buffoon wants to get laid. Sheldon is the embodiment of how much people really are stupid. He has no interest in the matter whatsoever and would argue that sex has not been upgraded to include the latest graphics and weapons that video games offer. Perhaps that's a bad example but he's so careless and devoted to his work. You stop and wonder why can't anyone in real life be that passionate about what interests them? But if none of that does interest you then the nerds next door neighbor Penny is a very nice sight to look at.ðŸ˜˜ The show has gained a bit criticism for not showing the females into science fiction and role playing but it has shown their other interests such as a memorable scene where they talk about Neil Diamond. Another criticism is that the show is just poking fun at nerds not portraying them in a positive way. But that's humor. It's fun to see how much little things can get the nerds excited. One valid criticism is the jokes. The jokes and references really are lame and cringe worthy. The shows humor lies in their antics, I would say, not the references. The Indian character Rag is another highlight. His recurring story is that he literally cannot talk to women unless he has alcohol in his body. I really do wish there was more stuff about the nerds actually making inventions though or, at least, some good talk about recent shows that people are into. So with the potential and humor I'll give this a healthy 7. As I sifted through the first 2 seasons of this show, I saw 'one of the pack', just another of those old boring sitcoms which have a very limited viewer ship and a very low rating on IMDb. <br/><br/>The only person to hold things together enough for me to watch it is, you might have already guessed, Jim Parsons. <br/><br/>However, 3rd season onwards with the introduction of Amy and Bernadette in major roles, this show has turned right on its end.<br/><br/>Friends successfully used this 'couples' concept before and TBBT is carrying this concept on.<br/><br/>A must watch for every Friends fan. Jim Parsons is definitely the bonus and this show has skyrocketed from season 3 onwards. I started watching this because I was interested in a comedy about geeks - it seemed like an excellent idea for a sitcom. And I was not disappointed. There is a lot of original comedy, and when it gets really technical, you aren't really supposed to understand it either - you're just supposed to laugh (no understanding of technical terms/ideas needed).<br/><br/>The star of the show is definitely Sheldon, brilliantly played by Jim Parsons. His misunderstanding of social situations and sociopathic behaviour makes for hilarious comedy. Not to mention his deadpan laughs and expressions. The other three guys are funny too, and have their own quirks that make for good comedy, but their 'weak' point is that they are normal when compared to Sheldon. That means their interactions with Sheldon almost always end comically. I was glad when the girls started getting bigger roles in the series - depending on Penny alone to bring up the female quotient worked only for a while.<br/><br/>Don't worry about the episodes being about incomprehensible science. There's little of that, and lots of comic situations involving relationships between room-mates, colleagues, friends and lovers. I like how there is the eccentric genius (Sheldon), the 'normal' genius (Leonard), the can't-talk-to-girls-without-drinking genius (Raj), and the most normal one of the group but who isn't a genius (Howard). They play off each other so well you become comfortable with their group dynamics after just a few episodes.<br/><br/>This show is still fresh even after seven-and-a-half seasons, and hopefully it will continue for at least another seven-and-a-half. I would rate a 10 but I don't like season 4 with Priya. I cant stand her. She isn't a good actress beside her look, she so not even attractive, snobbish have big head think her accent is charming--Not. Im not racist, but I don't like Priya, India woman, bad actress ever. The rest characters are good. I like Penny and Leonard than snobbish Priya who is the worse actress. I enjoyed this show up to season 4 with her, I turn off or change another show. They could find someone else better than picked that India woman played Prya, someone not think she better than everyone with an attitude. If I see her in any other movies or shows, it will not be the best movie or show. At first i wasn't sure about The big bang theory. I have never been a big fan of the American comedy, they never seem to make me laugh, they are too "clean" (that is the only way i can put it), i have always preferred the British comedy but when i met my partner he was into The big bang theory so i watched it and at first i thought "meh" but i watched more and it started growing on me and after years of watching it, it has become not my best comedy but my best American comedy.<br/><br/>I like how the actors and actress's play each part, i think the big bang theory has got better in time, now with the character "Amy" joining. Yes now it is like there is 2 Sheldons in the show but it makes it funnier. Even though the character Sheldon is annoying he grows on you and you get to really like him. The big bang theory is just brilliant, it makes me laugh and i enjoy watching it. I would recommend to anyone who loves clean, funny comedy.<br/><br/>7 out of 10. When you first began, it was interesting adjusting to the eclectic collection of personalities. Most of them having a commonality of knowledge, into the genius realm. Their personalities, the fresh dialog, & scientific information you passed on. I appreciated your celebrating individuality instead of conformity. You are changing the format/personalities of the original character, Sheldon. I liked the fact there were so many different personalities co-existing, and now, in my opinion you are conforming Sheldon into what this country seems to prefer. They have difficulty accepting people of different backgrounds/persona's. If you continue this avenue, I will find other things to watch. i liked the show but it was racist towards India,I think the makers of the show took Indian guy to insult India and American Govt didn't take any step nor the people of the show and also Kunal Nayyar,but i can understand that surviving in foreign country is hard and Kunal is doing for his daily bread but this doesn't mean that Indian are like servants or ugly that we cant get foreign girls to marry nor climate here is hot always except certain regions which is common in many countries. Everytime I talk about The Big Bang Theory I get a lot of backlash online. Some people claim it's not funny and boring. At times it almost feels like The Big Bang Theory is the Nickelback of television shows. It's 'cool' to say you hate the show, but you better not tell anyone you secretly like to watch it. I've been watching this show since one of the first seasons and I'm going to do so until the last episode of this final season.<br/><br/>The Big Bang Theory is and never will be on the level of shows like Scrubs and The Office US, but it's very funny. And in my humble opinion it's better than Friends ever was. The only downside of this show is that it's hard for most people to relate to a bunch of geniuses.<br/><br/>But at the end of the day I think most people can appreciate The Big Bang Theory if they give it a shot. It's really entertaining to watch Sheldon grow from a 'human robot' to someone with feelings. See how Raj learns to deal with women and how Howard turns from a creepy guy into a... creepy guy? And boy is Leonard lucky.<br/><br/>An amazing TV show and I'm going to be sad when it ends. I was hooked after the first episode. It has many characters each with there own quirks and comedy lines (such as Sheldon's famous door knock)however, it keeps from getting a 10 by forever being especially now at season 9 sort of repetitive. Don't get me wrong I'm still hooked but it seems like generic sitcom aspects which make it stay away from a 10. This is still highly relatable to many geeks or nerds out there and also gives surprisingly good drama and romance segments throughout to keep characters human. You always care about the characters and I'm sure that fans will stay with it until its unfortunate end. The acting is also brilliant not to mention Jim Parsons Golden Globe for his extraordinary performance as Dr. Sheldon Cooper. No matter what I'm sure you will have a blast with the big bang theory. There are many things to admire about Penny from The Big Bang Theory. She is tough, independent, intuitive, and fun loving. The writers have done a fantastic job in the past few seasons of fleshing out her personality to make her a deeper, intelligent, more three-dimensional character— things that girls can look up to. Unfortunately, all of these traits to appreciate are also where her admiral qualities end. <br/><br/>Penny is tough, but is often portrayed as hyper masculine in a way that undermines her femininity and chalks it up to her "corn-fed" Nebraska background growing up as a daddy's girl from a father who wanted another boy, instead of her father teaching her to be a tough girl. Characters will often comment on her man hands, in a way that isn't meant to reflect favorably on her more strong background, but shame her for not being what is the traditionally accepted view of her gender. Admittedly, this aspect of Penny is not a flaw of her, but of the writers.<br/><br/>Penny is independent, but she is an emotionally crippled commitment-phobe, due to a combination of her own Daddy issues, and poor relationship choices in the past. That is not to say that there are not good lessons for girls to take from Penny's own bad choices, but the writers have not utilized these. Instead, they glorify Penny's sexual promiscuity— there is nothing wrong with a woman expressing and finding her sexuality, but when a character's sexual past is viewed solely in terms of regrets it takes the empowerment and leads an audience down a dark path of acceptance of having less than what is deserved, or wanted— and make it a running punch-line, the undercurrent, of course, being that Penny is a slut. Penny sees herself this way as well and has mentioned it several times. This mind-set has affected her personal relationships with men, particularly Leonard. The same man she has spent a large majority of her twenties with, is still afraid to move in with, or make any major commitments to (She didn't even tell the guy she loved him until season 6). Penny's independence in this sense is not something to be admired. She is not this way out of personal choice as much as she is from fear. We don't need to be teaching girls to fear commitment or love; many of them do that enough already.<br/><br/>Penny is intuitive, but this street-smarts attitude leads her to also be one of the most condescending characters on the show. Her use of the phrase "Oh, Sweetie" when dealing with Sheldon is one of the most insensitive aspects of the show. We get it, he's annoying. He is also socially inept and incredibly innocent. He cares for Penny, as evidenced by the fact that he trusts her with sides of himself he has never told anyone else. She can often treat these moments as if he is a child, or as if it were a hassle to listen to. Her patronization doesn't end with him though; it is shown with every character at some point. She often views herself as some sort of Nerd Savior, someone who so graciously took the time out to teach these people what it's like to be "normal". Does Penny truly like them? Of course she does. However, if this were not a sitcom her friends wouldn't take her cavalier treatment so light-heartedly as much as they do.<br/><br/>Penny loves to have fun. Penny loves to drink. Bubbly blonde in her 20's with a failing career and, occasionally, love life likes wine, and tequila, and peppermint schnapps, and insert anything alcoholic here. Hilarious, original, concept and damaging to young girls who may view this behavior as a normal and healthy way to cope with problems. The extent that they have Penny drink is dangerous and one may even be able to classify her as a functioning alcoholic. Penny uses alcohol to socialize, and even sometimes as a remedy to get through some of the boys' game nights. Even for a sitcom, the lackadaisical treatment of this behavior is taken too far. <br/><br/>All of these flaws I'm trying to point out don't make Penny an awful person (it's part of the fleshing out I mentioned earlier of her character) they make her human. It is the lack on consciousness on the end of the writer's as to how Penny's problems have grown with her that becomes worrisome. Big Bang Theory is the opposite of what I expected,I expected it to be a lame bad show about stupid stereotypes but no this show is about 2 nerds and I am not a nerd or a hotshot but I love how they display the characters especially Leo but one thing I despise is Howard but because I just started and watched 4 episodes its unfair to be judge but one thing I know is that this show has talent.The science is so correct and I love how they used very correct science and I love the catchy intro song and this show can be educational especially for people watching this in middle-high school. So a definite thumbs up so far.But my opinion may vary from time to time but what I say is try this show it's very funny I mean sometimes I can't stop laughing like seriously like Sheldon just says a very smart but very wrong time remark then all Leo can do is face palm. Well if u think that this show is entertaining then I would have to agree with your view and frankly speaking this show is much better than most of the things in T.V currently.......But when a question arises: is this in someways groundbreaking????? then I would have to reply the question negatively............Despite being good or close to great this show is jst another version of Friends but this time with nerds.......Friends was not original itself to be quite honest<br/><br/>I will surely recommend this show to u but don't expect it to be different or ground breaking like modern family and arrested development Wonderfully funny show. Sorry it's going off. Bad reviews? Please get a life. You should be so funny. The Big Bang Theory is my favorite TV show of all time and I watch a lot of TV and movies. I love each of the characters because they are so different from one another yet fit like a glove in the show. The overview of the show about a bunch of bullied geniuses who are living in California that are working in the IT field sounds like it would be such a bore. Quite the contrary. As each character is so different, when brought together, they produce comical situations that are unbelievably intelligent and unique at the same time. The show has won awards but, in my opinion, not enough. All of the actors and actresses have such spunk and play their perspective characters really well. Dr. Sheldon Cooper is my favorite though so much so that my license plate on my car says "Bazinga". I have come out of several stores and found notes on my windshield stating people love my plates. I most relate to Sheldon because he reminds me of my son. The show is just amazing; I have never seen an episode that I did not laugh hysterically at and it always makes a bad day better. I have all the seasons on Blue Ray for that reason. A great show, a must watch and one that I hope will be around a long time. Regards, ~ Holley Jacobs Best series. Which is now running on the screens. Each episode is very entertaining yet educational. Actors serves great performances. First, the big bang, then dinosaurs, then nothing for a long time, then friends, then again nothing for a long time and the second Big Bang. Not the result of some kind of hellish nuclear particle accelerators, but a pair of fertile sitcomových authors (most of the episodes are signed by Bill Prady and Chuck Lorre). If I ever dared to suggest just that I like physics, then only in the form in which it presents this four NERD, which are just as smart as they are helpless in the face of the opposite sex (and I do not mean necessarily directly "sex"). Only a fraction of jokes rotates around theories whose ignorance puts you in a position Penny. You also have the option as well as Penny unknown concept vygooglit, eat something and knowing for next time to make someone else an idiot. If The Big Bang Theory I think after the first series of the second best American fiction comedy series (which is not so much criteria as I might seem), mainly due to a lethal concentration of jokes and - unlike IT Crowd - credible social impotence Leonard, Sheldon, Rajesh and Howard. I hate to admit it, but the gleeful laughter sometimes the person belonged to the screen. /refers to Seasons 1-8/<br/><br/>For years, I randomly watched some episodes shown on our local small TV-channel, but never thought of watching them in logical succession - until a couple of months ago, thanks to fast opportunities provided by the Internet... And I started to like the Series even more: many vague elements and scenes became more obvious, and the development of characters and comprehensions seemed filling and logical to me. The duration of less than 20 minutes enables to enjoy several episodes at a time and - in spite of repetitions and protraction characteristic to long-lived series - they are still catchy to follow and some ideas and expressions of the characters have secretly leaked into our family's daily life.<br/><br/>"The" star of the TBBT is definitely Jim Parsons as Sheldon Cooper, always excelling the other performances, although all the leading performers do a good job. Cooper's character differs even from his fellow "nerds"; I disagree with them who think there are lots of overstatements in those characters: there are thousands of clever people whose social skills have remained undeveloped due to various reasons, who are blunt and plain-spoken without realizing it, but who have nevertheless contributed to various fields of science. Luckily, the series includes the character of Penny (Kaley Cuoco) who prevents the show from becoming an inside-jokes-creation for geeky wiseacres, enhancing the audience and providing "simple" elements to the plot full of "clever" topics, terms and fields.<br/><br/>Well, the latter is not disturbing, on the contrary - TBBT is not an ordinary sitcom meant just for relaxation, but explains/recalls interesting and important facts about the phenomena that the world is all about. On the other hand, the humans remain humans, e.g. longing for love and recognition, fighting with injustice and loneliness. Life around us is versatile, with altering moods and themes, and, in my opinion, the series in question has reflected this in a distinct and witty manner.<br/><br/>PS Seasons 9 and 10 seen as well... Good to go! I gave this show a five because yes, it can be funny from time to time; and no, I'm not disagreeing with the millions who watch this show avidly. That being said, I think this show is way too overrated. This show is simply an outdated style. Whereas the rest of the comedy industry is moving forward, Big Bang remains a 90s sitcom, and I mean that in the least loving way possible. Big Bang is afraid to try anything new, anything that isn't a 20 year old comedy technique. If you are the type of person who would like to turn on your TV and turn off your brain, this show is for you. It is simple and predictable. You can nearly always see the nice, clean ending coming since the theme song. And I say 'clean ending' because heaven forbid Big Bang actually create conflict. The story arcs are obvious yet simple. The characters are the archetypes of a sitcom and therefore interact in the most rehashed way possible. The character growth is safe and conforms to what is most socially acceptable. The show's weak narrative voice lends you little reason to care about the characters. And my god, can they cut the laugh track already?! Overall I find nothing about this show to push the limits, challenge the acceptable, or even make me think in the slightest. This show goes exactly where you think it's going, and the character's stereotypes have gotten to the point of unwatchable. Without an engaging storyline or dynamic characters this show is dull, flat, and simple. That being said; it's better than 2 Broke Girls I like how he goes knock knock knock Penny three times The characters are all stereotypical caricatures with no depth or interesting points. I guess that's the point but it makes the stories less engaging. The actors did their best with the material though. The humour is unfunny and is mostly just pop culture references or stereotypical nerd jokes. Overall, this is clearly written by people who are not actually nerds themselves, just laughing at the stereotypes they have in their imagination. There are a few insights here and there, and I can recognise the characters in some people I have met, so I suppose the stereotypes are based on something real. Just that, brilliant, clever, funny. Anyone who not like this show maybe isn't smart enough. As fans of the chase from beginning to end, the growth of Sheldon is full of memories for the youthful years accompanied by this drama. I still remember that in the beginning of the series, Sheldon was only cared about himself. The talented human being with countless quirks gradually became emotional, learned tolerance and introspection, and began to be brave and romantic in the face of their lover.It can be said that the real success of this drama is not how many scientific theories and jokes it quotes. It is not that several protagonists are beyond the IQ and education of ordinary people. It is not how many star actors or even Hawking ' s cameos, but that it is a few strange. The unique perspective of some people show the lives. Classmate Xie made many so-called "normal" people find it difficult to understand the words and deeds that often made me laugh when I was paralyzed, and wanted to approach him. Well, it should be that, born with a low emotional quotient, it would inevitably hurt its geothermal love quotient to a heinous genius, right?<br/><br/>His speech has always been sharp and consoling, except for the ridiculous and warm "there there", he has no achievements, bitterness to roommate Leonard, knocking on the door in the early morning to talk, and out of his enthusiasm, he must become an unwelcome. The super evil light bulbs and other "evil" behaviors are all so worthy of forgiveness.<br/><br/>He is like an innocent and harmless child. From the operation of the universe to the folding of clothes, there are irreversible principles. In a sense, he is a nerd who doesn't understand what he can do.<br/><br/>However, no matter the roommate Leonard, and the wretched engineer Howard, the lovely Raj who can't speak when he meets a man, until the hot girl Penny, has unlimited patience with him. Whenever he saw that his "shameless" demands were met, such as letting Penny drive him to work early in the morning, spoiling and behaving in the name of sickness, and asking poor L classmates to help him make cheesecakes, when he laughed, It would be very gratifying.<br/><br/>Do they all love him?<br/><br/>In fact, who can not thank the ears? Mr. Douhua asked me if I married Xie's ear, would you like it? Not to mention that this is just a particularly illusory pseudo-proposition. His genius needs no more words, his kindness hidden in ridiculous expressions, his unreasonable cuteness, and his judgment of life and various people are irresistible to me Attractive.<br/><br/>"Cleverness" is the biggest feature of "The Big Bang Theory". The characters in the play are all high-intelligence scientists. As a result, the laughter of dialogue is fast and dense, and if you don't pay attention, you will miss the laughter. Fortunately, the subtitles are very interesting, sometimes even adding the source of the joke. The dialogue of the characters in the play is not the imagination of the screenwriter, but corrected by a real scientist. Salzburg, a professor of physics and astronomy at the University of California, Los Angeles, is a scientific consultant for The Big Bang Theory. In the play, those words of physical celestial beings that thundered the heroine and the audience were written by Salzburg, so they can withstand rigorous scrutiny.
This show is more suitable for audiences who are not satisfied with simple and straightforward funny means, often forums, online games, obsessed with comics and science fiction movies, with basic scientific knowledge. After all, maybe "Big Bang" was shot for those otaku and otaku girls: they make friends by writing blogs, they are accustomed to expressing emotions with emojis, feel that there is no need to be too entangled in the world, and they are more unabashed Express your inner thoughts. The otaku house girl should love this movie, especially in such cold weather. In the "Big Bang" drama, people often sit around the sofa, eating smart food bought from a Chinese restaurant, and having a clever conversation, which makes people feel warm.
Looking at the end, I was really envious of scientists' seemingly stereotypically planned life. Most of the time they simply lived in the two points and one line, obsessed with the small world of science, comics, and books. This also makes the show show a fresh wind, which is different from the other ethical plays with complicated network relationships, which makes people relive the simple and beautiful little happiness. It 's been a long time since I felt such a feeling in a TV series. When I saw it 2nd time, I get to know that the leonard and penny these two characters are very mean. And when penny got a job in pharama, her attitude changed suddenly. It seems she thinks she is better then Sheldon. So all i get that these two charactrs are the worst, and selfish It's an interesting sitcom because you don't usually see one built around nerds that lack swag. For a non-nerd like me it's both entertaining and educational (before this show I knew NOTHING about physics). All the different quirks that most characters have is funny. They are all different in their own way but it ALL works together. One of the worst TV shows ever made...The show is revolving around 4 nerds and they are nothing like nerds...They used the same jokes for 12 years humiliating each other just in different ways...Also without the laughtrack I don't think anyone would have laughed at it...The show is also extremely sexist..Women are often shown as objects and a lot of terrible comments are made on them throughout the show...Also the show is actually tells us that the people who read comics are weird.. Especially if you're a women..The show is also very offensive towards many cultures...The show is built on a basic stereotype of how nerds are, which is a lie...Final verdict:I don't know how many people liked it or how it's one of the most watched TV show ever in the history of television..But I think it's horrible and I'm so glad it ended. Around season 5+ it became more and more boring. There was no actual character development and it wasn't even amusing. One of the best shows ever...until season 5. The writing then got lazy, characters unfunny and obnoxious (Amy). This is clearly a copy of FRIENDS and sometimes it's obvious and worse but Sheldon is hilarious and there are some great moments. But out of nowhere it became a drama and got worse. It would be more appreciated if penny is less frivolous and plays a dime, after 6 seasons it is no longer possible to watch just because of her frivolity I don't know much about the kind of science that the main characters know but I like the idea of super smart shy people collecting memorabilia because I like to collect stuff. Before binge watching the show, I saw clips of Sheldon that makes me think he's funny no matter what he says. But now that I watched full episodes I didn't like that he was a total narcissist. Ok, after 22 seasons a show can get a bit tired. I'll concur with some of the less complimentary reviews, but without the vitriol. But then along came the final episode of season 11 and.......just and! In 11 seasons, this is by far my favourite episode. The casting was absolute perfection. I've watched 4 seasons of it,and I laughed a lot.Very funny! I mmm giving it 7 for all the good laughs I had, even though I stopped watching it since season 6, trust me I tried but I couldn't. Good thing I stopped as it might got lower than 7 Uptill season 7 , this was one of the greatest sitcoms ever. After that the writing quality has really deteriorated. Despite that you want to sit through the rest of it since you have invested so much in to these great characters. I watched the whole series finally. This is all IMO. The only person I found funny was Johnny. Sheldon is annoying. How he has friends I have no idea. Amy is not attractive and not funny. Bernadette has 2 things going for her. Figure it out. Penny is nice but kinda flighty. Howard needs another belt. He is intelligent but is only funny doing impressions. Raj has several problems. He seems to be needy. He doesn't understand personal space, etc. The series for me is hit and miss. Okay, where do I begin ? The show is absolutely funny, all the Characters are brilliant. Its my favourite show on air (not reached S12 yet) . The only one thing I don't like about the show is every now and then a Character keeps bring up race, basically white jokes. Hello "White people" ! I'm like #ucking hell are people obsessed with skin colour? (writers) could you imagine if it was the other way around ? There would be WW3. So I'm guessing the people behind the scenes must be democrats. Part from that, the show is awesome. What am I gonna do once I've finished all 12 season ? God help me ðŸ˜¢ It is a fantastic show and very funny and entertaining. The actors/actresses are very skilled and Jim Parsons is one of the most talented actors (besides Jim Carrey) I have ever seen in television.
I must admit though that I did not watch seasons 9-12. I think it was a pity that the show's plots became more and more about relationships/marriage cliches and less about the " nerdy and intellectual". Besides there are som demeaning comments and opinions about the single-lifestyle. But a great show afterall which can be seen over and over again...and it still makes me laugh:) Penny wearing the Hilary shirt in Season 2 episode 19 seriously?! Was she trying to let us know she didn't vote for Obama? But I bet she didn't have that same energy when Hilary was running against Trump...this show doesn't seem like it's for black folk I really wanna like it tho This is the number one show on TV and the number one show on our DVR. I love the scientists because I am a big fan boy too! Made for anyone who likes funny! We love it. It is funny and the characters are relatable and broken outcasts. The setups are hilarious. This show should go on forever! I just finished season twelve and I can only say thank u guys for making all those great moments specifically the moments u made us laugh . We will miss u. I watched TBBT from the beginning and I found it to be a great series.<br/><br/>I'm currently rewatching all episodes and I must revise my statement: it is the best sitcom ever made. The show has aged very well, no difference between 2007 and 2019. And I habe to admit that the earlier seasons are so much better than the later ones, and you remember why this show became such a success.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it yet, you know what you have to do now.<br/><br/>Thanks to all who made this show happen. 10 years in my heart for ever
Tbbt and friends on top "comedy" It's is nice serie. I enjoy every single episode i watch. They're very good and interesting team. Thumbs up for the job that they have done with these tv serie!!! Being smart is easy but being extraordinary brilliant is difficult... highly recommended series for every age... I really enjoyed watching "The Big Bang Theory". It is excellent and brilliant TV show with excellent actors. Good job. Since leonard promised to never ever propose again..... i was very much eager that penny wud get on her knees... wid flowers or a robotic replica of sm1 ( i knw it ) .. that is my only regret for loving the show.
i cried like a baby when sheldon appreciated his friends. still i feel cheated. after 10/10 . i cant degrade the best show ever. 12 years! Huh! Yes, Sheldon isn't the only one who didn't like change! Watching big bang over 12 years, I never imagined, this will ever end! Unfortunately, every good thing comes up end! Big bang is the only series I liked after Dexter and Friends! The characters are all great and memorable!
It would be nice if we get a sequel! When you watch any show and follow it up regularly then you start liking the characters even with their flaws. They become a part of your life. You get so familiar with them that you can just think about them and smile. But when the show ends and you know you won't get to see them again then it feels like a part of your life is gone. I felt the same way when Big Band Theory ended this year. It was a beautiful comedy and I love each and every character on that show and Sheldon will always remain treasured in my heart forever. I'm re watching this show again and I'm having the time of my life. Insanely great actors who stand out from others with their jokes and acting. But that hobbit who makes weird faces constantly only tries to get his shaft wet in almost every single episode which is pathetic. I cant believe the script is actually that. Him trying to get laid with literally everything that moves. Maybe the tv show would be way more fun if he was not crying on the couch because he didnt get laid two days in a row. It's really pathetic. Its been 12 years of amazing ride and feels very sad to see this show to end. I never felt the same for any other show (non even Friends or GoT). It was complete package of good script, comedy, character and mind blowing performance and it always kept me glued to TV for each episode when aired. Sure it had its ups and downs sometimes, but there is no such thing as perfection. Its not easy do write so amazing storyline, scripts, characters and create such amazing show which would captivate audience for 12 years, specially in the new world of streaming where new content is available everyday. This is itself an achievement in history of TV shows. People who are complaining about show, should try to come up with one good decent episode which will make people laugh for at least 10 mins themselves, no offence. So if you haven't started watching this show or stopped watching, please resume watching it. You don't have to binge watch this, just watch it whenever you feel like it. OR if feeling down and need laughter. It takes just 21 mins for one episode to finish, not much.
Only thing I did not like, they interviewed only Leonard and Penny in last episode, not other characters, which also felt incomplete. It almost felt like we (TV viewers) did not even get chance to say Goodbye to other cast members for this wonderful show. Thank you and Farewell BBT. Yes! In the beginning it was the most funniest shows, I've seen but later down the years, Just like every other sitcom! You end up stop laughing, as Jim parsons said "I guess it's enough", I never wanted it to end. But what to do every great beginning has to end. Especially all the sitcoms in a bad way. Nevertheless it's always been a good and will be a good show. I love everything about The Big Bang Theory. To me these days shows only come up with unrealistic drama with too much info of what happens in the bedroom. But here it reflects with a lot of humor how people would naturally react. And people react in many different ways, you don't know what's going to be said in this show as an reply. It keeps it entertaining while the characters still remains it's own personage like it's meant to. On top of that you get an dosis of everything in one episode, it's brilliant. The first 5-6 seasons were brilliant. And then everything started going downhill. It's still not as bad as most people say, it's definitely watchable, but that's all, it's just watchable. And I absolutely love Sheldons character. Some people have had a lot to say about how his character has become more mature and emotionally perceptive, but I certainly loved watching his character evolve and Jim Parsons did a brilliant job. The way Sheldons character evolved makes the show feel like a coming of age drama of sorts and once again a brilliant job by Jim Parsons, he's simply the best. This show started great and strong, but slowly became tedious to watch and annoying. From lovable geeks to annoying and cliche stereotypes. Having watched all the seasons, here's my final review of the show:
Had to change my rating from 10 to 8, because I've rated this one with 10 back when the show had three seasons and the final ones were really disappointing. So, sometimes, you had to keep watching because you loved the characters and the series had grown on you.
Overall, the show is one of the best comedies out there and a classic for sure. The first seasons were pure gold, funny, fresh and entertaining. The last ones slowed things down and focused more on the characters stories, although they were funny too.
Final thoughts: A must see, as it doesn't stray from the original idea, even if the characters changed overtime. I can't imagine people not liking this beautiful and hilarious show. Itz certainly better than " Friends" and far better than " HIMYM". This show deserves a 10/10 particularly for the way it ended. Anything less than 10, I smell a hatter. I have been a massive Big Bang theory fan since day one and the final ever episode wrapped everything nicely and it was a great ending and I will miss the show but least we have reruns and dvds One thing about The Big Bang Theory, it was consistent. It copied Friends storylines right until the very end. It's pretty bad when three years ago I mentioned that the finale of TBBT will include someone going overseas, and that someone will be pregnant. Also. Kaley Cuoco may be the worst actress I have ever seen, because her entire stint on the show was just copying Jennifer Aniston's "Rachel Green". Line delivery, mannerisms, movements, even almost all of the hairstyles, including cutting the hair short, to garner publicity. But anyways, there were a few laughs here and there, but the show was always overrated, and it's farewell was long overdue. Hiarious and some great guests, baranski is great...... however,,,,, the leonard character is the most annoying on tv period i believe.... no guy can whine that much have to fforward any scenes with hime and hot penny its excruciating I don't get the bad reviews but you like what you like. Yeah OK some episodes are more funny than others. The characters though are awesome. It taps into things I watch etc also which is cool!<br/><br/>Personally I love this show, shame its ending but it has been on for a long time. The big bang theory is a very entertaining sitcom. I rate it highly. The only problem is what sounds like the ender of the series. (Sheldon) Well as far as I am concerned--he can leave. I don't know if it is the writers, but he has come out as saying "we have done all there is to do" but I think the Sheldon character has progressively become more and more and more irritating over time. He (in my opinion) can definitely go away. The incredibly stupid behavior episodes of Sheldon are just stupid!! If Kaley Cuoco wants a spinoff without the Sheldon character--that would be great!!<br/><br/>I just want to add that if you watch the earlier episodes, the Sheldon character is a complete phobic ass. Chuck Lorre seemed to have built this show on his jackass character. That's sad. Chuck Lorre is a complete jackass himself for not realizing that he does not need to create a neurotic and bizarre character to continue humorous sitcoms! I certainly hope Kaley Cuoco gets a spinoff without the ridiculous Sheldon character!! The last few decades have been marked by a special cultivation of the romance of the future. We seem to have made up our minds to misunderstand what has happened; and we turn, with a sort of relief, to stating what will happen--which is (apparently) much easier. The modern man no longer presents the memoirs of his great grandfather; but is engaged in writing a detailed and authoritative biography of his great-grandson. Instead of trembling before the specters of the dead, we shudder abjectly under the shadow of the babe unborn. This spirit is apparent everywhere, even to the creation of a form of futurist romance. Sir Walter Scott stands at the dawn of the nineteenth century for the novel of the past; Mr. H. G. Wells stands at the dawn of the twentieth century for the novel of the future. The old story, we know, was supposed to begin: "Late on a winter's evening two horsemen might have been seen--." The new story has to begin: "Late on a winter's evening two aviators will be seen--." The movement is not without its elements of charm; there is something spirited, if eccentric, in the sight of so many people fighting over again the fights that have not yet happened; of people still glowing with the memory of tomorrow morning. A man in advance of the age is a familiar phrase enough. An age in advance of the age is really rather odd.<br/><br/>But when full allowance has been made for this harmless element of poetry and pretty human perversity in the thing, I shall not hesitate to maintain here that this cult of the future is not only a weakness but a cowardice of the age. It is the peculiar evil of this epoch that even its pugnacity is fundamentally frightened; and the Jingo is contemptible not because he is impudent, but because he is timid. The reason why modern armaments do not inflame the imagination like the arms and emblazonments of the Crusades is a reason quite apart from optical ugliness or beauty. Some battleships are as beautiful as the sea; and many Norman nosepieces were as ugly as Norman noses. The atmospheric ugliness that surrounds our scientific war is an emanation from that evil panic which is at the heart of it. The charge of the Crusades was a charge; it was charging towards God, the wild consolation of the braver. The charge of the modern armaments is not a charge at all. It is a rout, a retreat, a flight from the devil, who will catch the hindmost. It is impossible to imagine a mediaeval knight talking of longer and longer French lances, with precisely the quivering employed about larger and larger German ships The man who called the Blue Water School the "Blue Funk School" uttered a psychological truth which that school itself would scarcely essentially deny. Even the two-power standard, if it be a necessity, is in a sense a degrading necessity. Nothing has more alienated many magnanimous minds from Imperial enterprises than the fact that they are always exhibited as stealthy or sudden defenses against a world of cold rapacity and fear. The Boer War, for instance, was colored not so much by the creed that we were doing something right, as by the creed that Boers and Germans were probably doing something wrong; driving us (as it was said) to the sea. Mr. Chamberlain, I think, said that the war was a feather in his cap and so it was: a white feather.<br/><br/>Now this same primary panic that I feel in our rush towards patriotic armaments I feel also in our rush towards future visions of society. The modern mind is forced towards the future by a certain sense of fatigue, not unmixed with terror, with which it regards the past. It is propelled towards the coming time; it is, in the exact words of the popular phrase, knocked into the middle of next week. And the goad which drives it on thus eagerly is not an affectation for futurity Futurity does not exist, because it is still future. Rather it is a fear of the past; a fear not merely of the evil in the past, but of the good in the past also. The brain breaks down under the unbearable virtue of mankind. There have been so many flaming faiths that we cannot hold; so many harsh heroisms that we cannot imitate; so many great efforts of monumental building or of military glory which seem to us at once sublime and pathetic. The future is a refuge from the fierce competition of our forefathers. The older generation, not the younger, is knocking at our door. It is agreeable to escape, as Henley said, into the Street of By-and-Bye, where stands the Hostelry of Never. It is pleasant to play with children, especially unborn children. The future is a blank wall on which every man can write his own name as large as he likes; the past I find already covered with illegible scribbles, such as Plato, Isaiah, Shakespeare, Michael Angelo, Napoleon. I can make the future as narrow as myself; the past is obliged to be as broad and turbulent as humanity. And the upshot of this modern attitude is really this: that men invent new ideals because they dare not attempt old ideals. They look forward with enthusiasm, because they are afraid to look back.<br/><br/>Now in history there is no Revolution that is not a Restoration. Among the many things that leave me doubtful about the modern habit of fixing eyes on the future, none is stronger than this: that all the men in history who have really done anything with the future have had their eyes fixed upon the past. I need not mention the Renaissance, the very word proves my case. The originality of Michael Angelo and Shakespeare began with the digging up of old vases and manuscripts. The mildness of poets absolutely arose out of the mildness of antiquaries. So the great mediaeval revival was a memory of the Roman Empire. So the Reformation looked back to the Bible and Bible times. So the modern Catholic movement has looked back to patristic times. But that modern movement which many would count the most anarchic of all is in this sense the most conservative of all. Never was the past more venerated by men than it was by the French Revolutionists. They invoked the little republics of antiquity with the complete confidence of one who invokes the gods. The Sans-culottes believed (as their name might imply) in a return to simplicity. They believed most piously in a remote past; some might call it a mythical past. For some strange reason man must always thus plant his fruit trees in a graveyard. Man can only find life among the dead. Man is a misshapen monster, with his feet set forward and his face turned back. He can make the future luxuriant and gigantic, so long as he is thinking about the past. When he tries to think about the future itself, his mind diminishes to a pin point with imbecility, which some call Nirvana. To-morrow is the Gorgon; a man must only see it mirrored in the shining shield of yesterday. If he sees it directly he is turned to stone. This has been the fate of all those who have really seen fate and futurity as clear and inevitable. The Calvinists, with their perfect creed of predestination, were turned to stone. The modern sociological scientists (with their excruciating Eugenics) are turned to stone. The only difference is that the Puritans make dignified, and the Eugenists somewhat amusing, statues.<br/><br/>But there is one feature in the past which more than all the rest defies and depresses the moderns and drives them towards this featureless future. I mean the presence in the past of huge ideals, unfulfilled and sometimes abandoned. The sight of these splendid failures is melancholy to a restless and rather morbid generation; and they maintain a strange silence about them--sometimes amounting to an unscrupulous silence. They keep them entirely out of their newspapers and almost entirely out of their history books. For example, they will often tell you (in their praises of the coming age) that we are moving on towards a United States of Europe. But they carefully omit to tell you that we are moving away from a United States of Europe, that such a thing existed literally in Roman and essentially in mediaeval times. They never admit that the international hatreds (which they call barbaric) are really very recent, the mere breakdown of the ideal of the Holy Roman Empire. Or again, they will tell you that there is going to be a social revolution, a great rising of the poor against the rich; but they never rub it in that France made that magnificent attempt, unaided, and that we and all the world allowed it to be trampled out and forgotten. I say decisively that nothing is so marked in modern writing as the prediction of such ideals in the future combined with the ignoring of them in the past. Anyone can test this for himself. Read any thirty or forty pages of pamphlets advocating peace in Europe and see how many of them praise the old Popes or Emperors for keeping the peace in Europe. Read any armful of essays and poems in praise of social democracy, and see how many of them praise the old Jacobins who created democracy and died for it. These colossal ruins are to the modern only enormous eyesores. He looks back along the valley of the past and sees a perspective of splendid but unfinished cities. They are unfinished, not always through enmity or accident, but often through fickleness, mental fatigue, and the lust for alien philosophies. We have not only left undone those things that we ought to have done, but we have even left undone those things that we wanted to do<br/><br/>It is very currently suggested that the modern man is the heir of all the ages, that he has got the good out of these successive human experiments. I know not what to say in answer to this, except to ask the reader to look at the modern man, as I have just looked at the modern man-- in the looking-glass. Is it really true that you and I are two starry towers built up of all the most towering visions of the past? Have we really fulfilled all the great historic ideals one after the other, from our naked ancestor who was brave enough to kill a mammoth with a stone knif Great actors and actresses that deserve so much success after the bang theory ended I wish them all well and I wish them alot of succes in there up coming projects ,thank you big bang theory for being apart of my life on television and wish you all good health I've seen all Episodes of TBBT in German and in English and I must admit it's one one the best Series I've ever seen! Unfortunately the Production has finished and now I can only watch all Episodes again and again and again, it never gets boring! The show is great if you have an above avrage iq or below avrage but not for the avrage person...
but yes it declined and lost what it had... still i'd recogmend you watch the first seasone at least Amazing !! Hope it continues untill they grow old. This has been one of my favorite shows .
Everyone plays there part very well and I'm addicted to it.
I am sad that it is ending but everything comes to an end at some point unfortunately. Too bad they are ending the show. Had a blast since the first season. Now I Will only see re runs but it was worth it. I think they are ending the show at the right time I think Sheldon & Amy should move across the country and have Amy and Penny with phone call scenes. And maybe once in a while have Sheldon could have a scene. A replacement character for Sheldon could be his childhood buddy Tam. Where you can watch this episode without laughing, I was able to overpower the only 3 series due to the fact that the laughter I was distracted. The laugh-off is already outdated, it's insulting! People aren't idiots and they don't need a clue where to laugh. Especially in this series, he almost after every phrase!!! After watching the Childhood Sheldon wanted to watch BBT, but I can not lifted up this laugh, but I'm because of him, even the phrases of the characters can not hear. I loved it until they added Amy. It started to be full of such cringy humor. I supposed I'd get over Bernadette but Amy ruined it. This tv show should've stayed at its nerdy roots. I gave 6 stars just because of the first 6 seasons.This show stopped being funny after 6th season.I don't even smile when I watch.Don't they see that it sucks?! Not funny! Change your writers or just stop it for the God sake! I had avoided this sitcom for a while but after some time I grew to like it. Four guys and three females; the guys being big pop culture fanatics (just like me!) and the women being the center of it all. I had two favorites from the show, and those were Raj (who in real life is the youngest of the four guys) and Amy (Mayim Bialik from Blossom and Beaches). The others were OK, and the guest stars were pretty cool. James Earl Jones, LeVar Burton, and Carrie Fisher to name a few of them. But after a while it just got repetitive (like The Simpsons) and the jokes got just plain corny and unfunny too. I'm not a big huge fan and I don't watch as many sitcoms anymore, but this was decent. My advice is to watch some random episodes and don't bother with the newer ones. Case closed. Used to really enjoy the series until for some unknown reason they introduced Amy Fowler played by Mayim Bialik to the show, which has forced the pace and writing of the show to become in a word 'woody'. Shame, but I find the show is getting progressively too cheesy and I feel her character (or possibly poor acting) doesn't help the show at all, rather quite the opposite. Recommendation - That her character self-combust in a lab experiment gone wrong! Adding drama to a science comedy just doesn't react calmly "The Big Bang Theory" is a 20 mins comedy capsule, which I take every week. The show is filled with cute and funny characters. The main character who makes this show amazing is Sheldon Cooper, who takes this show to a different level. This show is really a laugh-bomb for nerds like me.The Big bang family grows with the seasons. The Energy in the show goes on increasing until Leonard & Penny's Wedding. Thereafter the humour in the show will be little decreased but will become constant later. Best sitcom in the 21st century. The jokes relating to science are hilarious. The sitcom built up the characters so nicely over the seasons. All the actors playing the characters have certainly lived up to the expectation of the viewers. The show made a good correlation between the characters. One of the best parts of the show is its guest actors. All the guest actors played in this sitcom played a significant role building up the amusing plots. One might say this isn't the kind of show which can leave you on the hinges at the end of seasons but on the contrary, I suppose this is a perfect show for the viewers who find it hard to keep up with the show episode after episode in their hard and fast life. To top it all off, this is the kind of show which will surely make you fall in love with nerd culture. this programme is about four scientist that are studying at university, the main characters are Sheldon Cooper, Leonard Hofstadter , Howard Wolowitz , Rajesh koothrappali and penny Hofstadter. Sheldon, Rajesh, Leonard and Howard are massive comic book and role playing games fans.<br/><br/>I think the big bang theory is funny because it has a lot of comedy in it as well as I think they have a brilliant cast.<br/><br/>there has been has been 9 seasons and the 10th season has just began.<br/><br/>they are all enjoyable episodes and I rate this 9 out of 10 because it is brilliant, I would recommend you to watch it because it is just one of the best programmes ever. The big bang theory is a fantastic piece of quality writing. Each episode is packed full of comedy. The characters are all individually amazing but together you truly appreciate the comic genius of this show. The more you watch this show the more you appreciate the humour, with running themes and story lines. It is a shame that the female lead is portrayed as a stereotypical 'dumb' blonde but her interaction with the 'nerds' restores a little faith in humanity. Although this show is primarily a comedy it is also quite educational with science being packed into the show. The writers clearly did a lot of research for the show and the quality is evident. With an amazing array of celebrity guest stars this is truly a show you will want to watch again and again. I find the show very amusing to watch. A lot of interesting and funny things that occur in the show. I always like to google some things that I don't understand in the show to my basic knowledge. This show is a calming show to watch. Attract all the different people to this one show. Very nice to see with family and friends. Everyone can watch it and enjoy. This show will teach you things in the most interesting and fun way. If you don't want to learn it can be fun just to watch it for fun. Watching it alone may give you better recognition of plot. If you are a person who likes to be with friends that is the perfect show to watch with friends at least the first couple of seasons. In the wake of his "Two and a Half Men" success, the omnipresent Chuck Lorre is back with an all-new concept. Whereas "Men" revolved around two sex-starved geeks (plus one Lothario), here we have four sex-starved geeks (plus one squeaky-voiced, floppy haired Valley Girl).<br/><br/>In this timeless series, viewers are treated to something television has never explored before--the daily routines of ill-mannered, under-groomed slovens trying to get laid. This they somehow do, though how hooking up with any of them constitutes "getting lucky" is anyone's guess.<br/><br/>Watch for plenty of minority-favoring, nasal-voiced characters who place an invisible "Y" before all of their spoken "A's." Yes, they eat "yapples," "plyan" excursions and "styand" by each other through bad hair, clothes and manners days. How nice.<br/><br/>Typical 21st-century fare. Watch it or flip to almost any other channel to see more of same. Well,like first episode this one also takes a different approach then the past five seasons. First of all we have a massive Sheldons character development, and I don't think that everyone would welcome the change in his development but I found it quite nice, because in this episode Sheldon is becoming more and more like a normal "human being" when he express his emotions (although he hasn't lost his unique touch) and the climax of that change is when he begs Penny not to hurt his friend by breaking up with him. That scene is for me the peak of the entire episode. So beautiful and yet so strange when you hear those words coming out from Sheldons mouth. And this scene alone gives 10/10 for me. But unfortunately the rest of the episode and other characters aren't that good. The biggest disappointment are of course Leonard and Penny. They are really turning their relationship into one annoying and pathetic fiasco. Leonard has gone back to his old self and has sadly yet again become henpecked and lost his balls, and Penny, well she is just plain old Penny...exploiting Leonard and toying with his emotions for her is what she does the best. It's really sad that their characters have been degraded to the begging of season 2. :( Hopefully that would change with upcoming episodes. And last but not least Howard in International space station is having a hard time with other astronauts making practical jokes on him. This part is not so much interesting to the plot or character development but it serves as much needed comic part of the episode. All in all my final review would be 6/10. Not bad at all. This episode has humor, has character development but something just isn't quite there yet. Having heard good things about the strength of Big Bang Theory's writing, I am sorry to say that I immediately hated the show.<br/><br/>Rather than having an intelligent plot with character depth, they seem to wander wherever they need to, to drop in one-liners. For example, their friend may have a peanut allergy in Season 1, Episode 2, but they joke about it even though it may be life-threatening. Having a medical receptionist tell them to wait in Season 1, Episode 1 so that she can work on her crossword puzzle is also out of character -- something she'd be fired for -- and was clearly dropped in so that the geeks could solve it and show their intelligence.<br/><br/>The acting and awkward pauses for audience laughter seem forced. All this I get from the first 100 seconds of episodes 1 and 2. It is easy for me to conclude that the show lacks story, and with its laugh track (I don't care whether it's live or recorded) it seems like a throwback compared to shows like Modern Family, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Extras, and Community. I recommend these shows to you highly.<br/><br/>My intuition is that this is not a show for intelligent people who might playfully call themselves geeks. This is a show for the butt-heads who may lack refinement but like to laugh at what they think a geek is. when i watched big bang theory season 1 it was great something new something brilliant but since Amy & Bernadette characters move to the this show suddenly every thing change Sheldon which was a great character with lot of science idea became a normal guy who often tell something about science well maybe writer and producer of this show back a little and watch that episode that Sheldon said :you think the changes are great but its not all i say is 20 min is not enough to get to story of 7 character as you see we rarely see RAJ anymore it's maybe even better to cut Amy and Bernadette because they not enough funny what i said its not only my idea what i said this from my friends and myself that we truly wants to our favorites TV shows back on top and not only makes us laugh teach us something useful that we can use in our Conversations again maybe you want to say shut up it's not what you say its the best show but if you be Realistic you will agree with me I love this show but the first 2 of this season is too explicit. I hope they don't make it like Two and a Half Men. BBT has many young viewers and us old people like the clean humor of the past years.<br/><br/>It would be a shame to misuse the talent of these actors. Glad Parsons won the Emmy; he deserved it as does JG. Two and a Half Men started out just fine and got so dirty we stopped watching. I had high hopes for BBG.<br/><br/>We don't have enough clean shows on TV. At least this show is devoid of blood and guts. Now if they just keep to the clean humor and good writing of the past seasons. I will keep watching for a couple more shows. Let's hope for the best. The Big Bang Theory has really grown on me, after a rather troubled beginning.<br/><br/>The premise didn't look overly fresh, after all the "geek meets pretty girl" plot had already been used to death, and just throwing in more geeks and legit science into the mix was hardly enough to make me anticipate the show.<br/><br/>Instead the characters work pretty well, covering a broad area of the geek spectrum.<br/><br/>Sheldon is so self-absorbed he failed to develop even the most basic social skills. That's the main source for laughters to be honest, even though his blissful yet exasperating lack of "humanity" is probably a bit over the top to be credible.<br/><br/>Leonard is the least awkward character, thus the more realistic one and the only who can be used in more traditional sit-com situations.<br/><br/>Penny is also a rather easy-to-relate with character: possibly the most credible "cute average" female character in a sit-com in a long time.<br/><br/>Raj and Howard work well as "one-trick pony" sidekicks, adding enough ethnic and (anti)social diversity to jokes and comedic situations.<br/><br/>The interaction between characters is usually good and sort of believable, and even the perturbing presence of Penny is handled decently, although the "why does she hang out with such losers?" question is still unanswered. Let alone the whole Leonard-Penny relationship... The best part was the one when Leonard was pining for her. Keeping the "will they or won't they" situation going on for as long as possible, with Leonard getting small and insignificant wins, along with bigger disheartening setbacks, would have been more realistic, more compelling and wouldn't have killed the one and only actual plot.<br/><br/>Once Leonard and Penny are together (or are going through a typical on-and-off relationship), there isn't much to look for in the show, besides the throwaway gags or the occasional subplot. Because the other characters are, quite frankly, stereotypes; and altering them for storyline purposes would just kill the show. I mean, Sheldon can't suddenly become friendly and laid-back. Raj can't become chatty. Howard can't stop being a (funnily) disgusting perv...<br/><br/>So, while the characters are indeed genuinely likable (Leonard and Penny) or hilariously annoying (Sheldon, Raj and Howard), their very nature hinders a serious process of development. And that means there isn't so much material left for the show before it gets repetitive, derivative or dull. Or something different.<br/><br/>One last gripe: the excess of references to the geek culture can get tiresome at times, especially for those who (like me) aren't into comic books, Star Wars etc... When a joke or a gag is funny only to those "in the know", then it's not that good in my opinion.<br/><br/>All in all TBBT is a very enjoyable sit-com, a refreshing take on a far from fresh concept. Sadly I feel it's just a matter of time before the inherent flaws of its very concept start kicking in and ruining it.<br/><br/>But as long as it lasts, let's all enjoy The Big Bang Theory!
