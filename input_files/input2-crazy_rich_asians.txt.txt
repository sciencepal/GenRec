The age old romance story. Rich person in love with poor person. Rich parent(s) not really in favor of that relationship - to say the least. Now while this does not invent anything new, it does have some fine touches. It is quite self aware, while ticking off all the boxes it needs to (stay in the predictibility lane). Characters are nice though and the acting really helps too.

Also not everything gets resolved, because there are problems that simply no solution can be found for. And that is a good thing in my book, but may impact some hopeless romantics in a bad way. Don't sweat it though, overall this will go where it needs to go to stay a romantic comedy. No matter the main players or their heritage. Speaking of which, the movie acknowledges a lot of things, some may be cliche when it comes to race or how they are treated in America ... sadly still true though
