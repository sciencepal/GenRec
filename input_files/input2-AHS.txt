American horror story is a great if you're into this kind of horror, people that are into slasher movies/shows will probably not like this.<br/><br/>Overall AHS has its low seasons and high seasons, every season is very different and that's why most people aren't into all the seasons.
Overall probably the best thing about this show is the casting and acting. Sarah Paulson, Evan Peters, Jessica Lange and Kathy Bates for example are incredible actors/actresses that never disappoint in this show.<br/><br/>I personally think its genius how Ryan Murphy managed to make every season very different from the ones before but still manages to connect all of them.<br/><br/>My opinions on the seasons;<br/><br/>1. Murder House: 7.5/10, Great season with some real scary things, not my favorite season, it had flaws but the casting was amazing.
2. Asylum: 9/10, Scariest season of all for sure, my kind of horror. You'd expect that a season that is mostly filmed in just one building would be kinda boring, but it sure wasn't. Incredibly great season
3. Coven: 8.5/10 probably the most hated season of the show, but why? I loved it. Sure, it wasn't that scary and it had flaws but the casting was perfect. Lange and Emma Roberts were both perfect for their roles. Evan Peters annoyed me though, his role with the whole love triangle with Madison and Zoe was stupid. Probably my favorite season although it wasnt scary at all.
4. Freak Show: 5.5/10 Doesn't compete with the other seasons to me, the casting was good but that was about it. Overall I kinda enjoyed it, I guess? The ending was disappointing although Lange left the series in a great way. The only character I really enjoyed was the villain. Not a great season, sorry.
5. Hotel: 6.5/10 Not a very beloved season by most, but to me it was watchable and I dont feel like I wasted my time watching it. The casting was okay, Lady Gaga did great job acting and definitely added a great touch to the season but apart from that it wasn't a really interesting season all around. A lot of blood and sex but not the best season of the show. Overall I would recommend watching it although most people aren't into it.
6: Roanoke 7/10 Finally another scary season. The season felt like a haunted-House horror movie but longer. Sarah Paulson did incredible as the "crazy, paranoid wife". A big plot twist in the middle of the season and it left me with some confusion but I sure did enjoy this season.
7. Cult 7/10 Before the season started I was really scared I wasn't gonne like this, politics, clowns and Evan as the villian, but after watching it I actually enjoyed it. The concept was alright to me and some episodes were just boring. Again, Sarah Paulson played the crazy wife but again, she portrayed it well. Her wife was very annoying and I hoped she'd die early on but she didn't. The "different" episode with Frances Conroy was incredibly boring and didnt feel needed but sure let's forget about it. Sarah did a perfect job and her character was great, excited to see more of her next season.<br/><br/>I love this show and I'm definitely excited for season 8 (Apocalypse) and season 9&10.
I can understand why people dislike it but it just is your cup if tea or it isn't. Hope to see more of these horror shows in the future. A dysfunctional family moves into an old house, a house with a history of horror. For the main characters, history is what the first episode is all about: the husband's history of infidelity, the wife's history of having a bloody stillbirth, the daughter's history of cutting herself -- for each a long history of pain and resentment and longing for change, though it quickly becomes apparent the only change coming will leave them hysterically screaming to the sudden, violent, gory end. The one sure thing this show promises is that people will die horribly, and we will all be terrified by it.<br/><br/>The characters are not likable; they may not even be redeemable. Even the suffering wife is bitter and cold and hateful. But do they deserve what horrible things will assuredly happen to them? Nope. Which means their fight is our fight, and their fear is our fear.<br/><br/>American Horror Story is interesting, entertaining, suspenseful, and ambitious. After watching the first episode, I want to watch some more. There are so many things that could have gone wrong with F.X. attempting to take on a genre that American Film makers have turned into a high school idiot machine. Thankfully the people who made this know what they are doing. If you are a horror buff you will understand what I am talking about after a couple of viewings. It could have been so easy to make a high school shock fest all wrapped up for a safe and appropriate viewing experience. This show is weird, deranged, creepy, and best off all well acted and well written. Great character development that is based on things people would actually do if they faced that situation. This show really does have a bright future if they keep rolling at this pace. I must say, I am very impressed. Almost Walking Dead impressed. This show though is way more deranged then Walking Dead though. Keep it up F.X. . You have a potential winner on your hands. This show of course is not for everybody. The people who don't like it would be better served by watching something a little more tame and mediocre like Tera Nova. These days when the genre of horror is brought up most people think of the latest slasher bloodfest like "A Nightmare on Elm Street" or the latest attempt at trying to scare us with some lame movie like "The Ring". It might be a problem with the time constraints of a 90 minute or 2 hour movie, it's hard to completely capture the audience and slowly twist the perceptions.<br/><br/>Another thing forgotten in recent horror movies is the fact of NOT explaining everything within 5 minutes of it happening, it's more entertaining and spooky to speculate why someone sees something or what actually happened in a particular scene. People forget that in some of the best horror pictures like "Psycho" the real horror came from the suspense and the wondering of what was going to happen and that the violence was secondary.<br/><br/>The dialogue between characters is actually impressive especially in a couple scenes that you will be able to easily pick out. Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk who also created Nip/Tuck and Glee (odd combo) seem to be able to excel in almost any genre and especially now in horror. It's rare to writers like this who aren't afraid to jump around from genre to genre fearlessly.<br/><br/>It's hard to describe many aspects of this show without giving away to much so I must refrain from describing the plot as it appears so far.<br/><br/>The day after I viewed the pilot episode I was shocked to see all the negative feelings towards the content of the show. So let's be VERY clear this show is classified MA which stands for "Mature Audiences" which should be taken the same as and "R" rating for films, so if you don't want you or your kids to see it that's fine but don't get all pissy about a show you decided to watch that was marketed as a "psycho-sexual horror". Yes there is scenes of semi explicit sexual acts and scenes of disturbing violence but it's a horror story so images like that are to be expected.<br/><br/>It's refreshing to find a show that is different and does not follow traditional formula's TV horror shows. I plan to watch every week and enjoy the series fully, since it is honestly very rare to see a show do better in it's genre then most recent films.<br/><br/>American Horror Story arrived a couple weeks ago on the great FX network that also houses two of my favorite shows: "Sons of Anarchy" and "Justified". I found the first episode to be awesome, great suspense and has a really eerie/scary feeling to it., Definitely not your typical haunted house plot, i think the writing is very creative and very well thought out,. <br/><br/>The first episode is very well assembled and an impressive pilot. We are quickly introduced to all the characters, who appear to be quite likable, yet slightly flawed. Then we are introduced to a cast of supernatural beings, Who are definitely flawed,and most most definitely BIGTIME CREEPY,. Man just watch this show its overly awesome. wont be regretted. ,If you grab a lot of the great horror movies and mix them up you get American horror stories. There were quite a number of sequences that were unsettling and quite disturbingly perfect,. Every scene leaves you stunned in a way, waiting there stil and anxiously not knowing whats gunna happen next,. This show has everything and more all us horror fans need these days.<br/><br/>OVERALL The show utilizes both shock and psychological terror to frighten, Absolutely loved it, exceeding my expectations like nothing else. A MUST WATCH!!<br/><br/>cannot wait for the next episodes! <br/><br/>10/10 there is nothing else that compares to this style on TV,. watch it and try to disagree ;) OK, this is getting ridiculous. Extremely cheap plot, 95% of the episodes are just annoying screaming and crying.<br/><br/>Watch the first three series, then quit for your own good. Those are really good and atmospheric actually. They get really dark and scary, very different from most other series. Then gradually I felt like they either ran out of ideas, or kept trying to force too many. The last season is a great example. They try to deal with the elections, 4chan, clowns and it is starting to make no sense. The dark atmosphere is completely lost and the series is average at best now. If you are here for the apocalypse, you came to the wrong place. Don't get me wrong, it started great, I was hooked from the episode 1 already. Somwhere after the episode 3 it started to lose track, there's a bunch of seasons correlating, which is great, but I feel like this season doesn't have its own identity. It's all about the past and how all the other seasons are somehow connected, but not much of a plot I came here for. What a shame, ahs used to be really awesome and unique. But hey, if you wanted a season where all the previous seasons' plots collide into one, then this one's for you. Season 7 - Cult. I will be completely honest, the first 2 episodes really turned me off. I figured this season was heading down the same path as Roanoke and perhaps worse with the political and social overtones. HOWEVER, I decided to keep watching. Things have turned around dramatically and I am now engaged in this season. It is ridiculous and unbelievable, but the characters are now starting to show themselves and several secrets are now out in the open. The show has been very good the past 3 episodes and has officially drawn me back in.<br/><br/>I will say this... the 5th episode "Holes" is brutal. I've been watching horror for over 30 years and I can honestly say I haven't had a scene un-nerve me to the extent this one did. Watch and you'll see what I mean. I do love some Ryan Murphy flash. Or, did? After a bit, though, the lack of substance creeps in. Early seasons American Horror Story (like Glee, & Nip/Tuck), especially Murder House, were perfectly spooky but there is a sense that someone gave up, moved on. The Apocalypse season, like Cult before it, has gone off the rails. Like I'd missed a few minutes and came back to a different show. Goodbye, Ryan Murphy. I'm done with you and your shallow shows. Season Seven of AHS is nothing like the others, it has NO horror just murder. The story is somewhat like the Manson murders but more politically charged against Trump etc/ AHS took a turn for the worst in this season buy using politics and senseless murder for the "Cult" (manson) . I enjoyed the other seasons which had somewhat of a horror theme but this one was boing, nothing creepy or anything like the rest. Enjoy if you like politics .. We go back to 1984, only to find ourselves at another Camp Crystal Lake. The writers are only human, but I guess their well of inspiration has finally gone dry. No surprise that Evan Peters sat this one out. The first three seasons were fantastic. They were creative, well-written, and well-casted. Things began going really downhill at season 5 and they have progressively gotten more political and less creative. I was ADDICTED to the first few seasons but I couldn't even get through one full episode this past season. Just political garbage. Who is writing this?? Initially I was left wondering how - what essentially is a short horror movie - could be made in to a long running TV series, but after a few episodes I started to realise that it's the Ryan Murphy magic that is sustaining this outstanding show.<br/><br/>Much like Nip/Tuck, you have to suspend your belief and see this as purely entertainment. There's so many open ended narratives that are slowly unfolding and although at times the show verges on the edge of cliché, a single episode could easily match the brilliance of such horror classics like The Amityville Horror and The People Under the Stairs.<br/><br/>At the end of every episode I feel shocked that 40 minutes have gone by, which is a sure sign that this show is pure, unadulterated, entertainment. Just started watching series 8. Switched off after episode 3. What on earth has happened to this once excellent series. Completely nonsensical plot if indeed there is one and very tired acting by a cast which I think has become intolerant of each other. The scriptwriters need to go back to the drawing board and start again. I am hugely disappointed and have become entirely disillusioned. The reset button needs to be pushed. I have awarded a score of 1 out of 10 for purely sentimental reasons. AHS is officially my most favorite horror/thriller/creepy tv show and also my most hated tv show! All thanks to season 7. Which is easily the worst season they've made. How can a show SO incredibly good create seasons like 5- hotel (and my personal favorite, season 3- coven) and then actually think that season 7 was a good idea?! 
Ugh God and Sarah paulsons annoying cry/whine has been annoying but manageable throughout all seasons but in season 7, I. Can't. Take. It. <br/><br/>Such a disappointment when you wait forever for the new season to air and it's so boring/stupid that you don't ever care to keep watching it. Stopped watching after episode 6. <br/><br/>DONT LET ME DOWN AGAIN AHS. Something totally different in a entertainment landscape of toned down crap. Finally something that pushes the boundaries and takes some chances. In a time when everybody worries so much about whats real they unwilling to buy into anything slightly outlandish. Suspend your disbelieve and take a walk into the strangest, most twisted little series I've seen since Carnivale. I love this nightmarish ride into the twilight zone. <br/><br/>I think the casting is superb. Great acting throughout. The writing is fast paced and doesn't stretch things out like many long winded series. Too many shows take for ever to get the ball rolling. This show is fast paced and never leaves you much chance to breath before springing another traumatic event your way. I can hardly wait to see where this fun house ride leads to next. Wow, i really wanted to like it, a series about horror stories, nothing can be better than this.<br/><br/>The pilot started good, with the typical story about what happened to the people in the house to lay the ground for what's to come for the new owners.<br/><br/>10 minutes after these guys move in, the pilot starts to slowly and surely turns for the worse.<br/><br/>The "horror" and "scary" parts are not horrific and scary at all, in fact, I wasn't scared not even once. The way the scenes are composed is amateurish at it's core and the dialog is incredible stupid and unrealistic.<br/><br/>I know this is not real life but the conversations and situations have to be at least logical in it's own way.<br/><br/>The majority of scenes are just plain disgusting, they also felt forced and by the time I watched 30 minutes, it was just too much for me.<br/><br/>Slight Spoiler Ahead: --------------------- <br/><br/>A house keeper that is a ghost but in fact it is a hooker than also turns on the husband of the house that then give us a masturbation scene, not only that, the psychopath patient of this guy then falls in love with the daughter of the masturbation guy that is also trying to kill herself.<br/><br/>This is the basic script for the pilot, can you believe it?<br/><br/>End of Spoiler. --------------- <br/><br/>This show has the word "PERVERSION" at it's root, it's seems that all the script and the acting is done purposefully to entice the pervert, shame on you !<br/><br/>There is an over abundance of sex portraits in the worst possible way.<br/><br/>The story has no logic whatsoever, it's disgusting, immoral and quite idiotic.<br/><br/>I'm a fan of horror and/or scary movies and I just can't believe how wrong this pilot was.<br/><br/>If this is the way to open the series then I'm sure I wont watch anymore.<br/><br/>This seems like a real bad series, score is just wrong on this one and I totally disagree with the majority of the reviews here.<br/><br/>I really don't know what the target audience for this series should be, but I'm sure nobody in the right mind will like it.<br/><br/>That this series is already renew for 2015 while other incredible good series like "Awake" got canceled in the first season should tell you a lot about the world we live in.<br/><br/>I really don't know how the story proceeds from the pilot but one thing is for sure, I'm not interested and if you can't see how gross and utter disgusting this series is from the pilot and need to see more then it's all on you.<br/><br/>You SHOULD KNOWN better. <br/><br/>If you want a real horror story please, do not waste your time with season after season of this pile of crap, better go watch a REAL true horror story series like True Detective.<br/><br/>Good things comes in small packages. Best thing in the show so far: Alex Breckenridge The absolutely worst thing so far: McDermotts playing with himself scene. The scariest thing so far: an 8.5 rating and a whole bunch of good reviews. Maybe its the ghosts??? <br/><br/>We all know the primary reason this show was 'created'. Its the money. Horror or the supernatural is trendy. Look at Twilight, True Blood, Paranormal Activity, The Walking Dead (an awesome show, by the way) and others. Just throw in some sex and you got a winner. I battled through the first season and it was rough. If it wasn't for 45 minute packages arriving every week I probably wouldn't be able to watch this horror. And I have seen all kinds of horror movies before. I am a fan of the genre. Honestly, I thought the show hit rock bottom in the Halloween episodes. But it went straight through that rock and landed in the cesspool beneath. I had extremely low expectations and it turned out to be just what I expected from Glee with ghosts, monsters and other whatnot's. Why am I disappointed by this horrible American story then? Well, there is this lack of creativity. And I mean lack as in there is no creativity. The story is a collection of every horror cliché known to mankind. Not to mention all the plot elements that were just copied from old horror movies, polished and repainted for people who have never heard of or seen The Amytiville Horror, The Shining, Rosemary's Baby, Poltergeist and countless other movies. The house itself has a serious ghost infestation. They are everywhere. More importantly, they have abilities that are not ghost-like (if you don't understand what I'm trying to state here, watch The Shining please). They can materialize anytime and anywhere inside the house, have therapy and a prescription for Prozac, have sex with each other and with the living thus conceiving a child, hurt the living with weapons like guns and fire pokers, stealing newborn babies, eat a sandwich and drink coffee, fall in love.....This premise is completely illogical since most of them died violently, often by the hands of another ghost, and are now stuck in this house forever. No ill feelings, resentment, revenge, no making someone suffer for a long, long time ??? Apparently not.<br/><br/>Positives? It looks good. Oh, and Miss Breckenridge in a French maid outfit. That's about it. EDIT: THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE FIRST SEASON. First of all I wanna state this is a review for season 9 the tribute to the slasher 80s American horror story 1984.
this could be a great tribute to Jason and f13 but instead and although they used some 80s horror elements the outcome failed as this was more a parody of the 80s slashers rather than an actual horror series.
the scenario was ridiculus and by mid season it became absolute trash.
people were killed...and resurrected by the satan ? what else they will think to destroy the series ?
instead of doing a serious horror like they done in the 80s they made a black parody of the 80s slashers.....this is not working.
very very disappointed fom 1984 season 9 series AHS
the only reason I kept watching was the woods setting and the Jason references the twist of the real killer...etc....but that was not enough to save this series. The second season of American Horror Story was excellent, but the last (third) is one of the worst I've ever seen! I wonder at what were the authors of this show, whether they are drugged or mad because such a large amount satanic perversion, brutality, slaughtering, and the total absurdity of exercising their own demented fantasy is difficult to invent by normal person. Above all, the show has no longer the charm and originality as a second season, and this is just the accumulation of shallow, cheap grotesque scenes that shocking viewers. And merge them with quite stupid dialogues. All in all, a great disappointment and hope that something like this will never make again! Pity. This series started with an already old but always appealing story: a family moves in a haunted house. The first episodes were promising but it all went downhill. This is one of those series where the writers lose their imagination all of a sudden. There are ghosts who behave like humans and, after the body being killed and buried still appear and have human behaviour (having sex with humans, going to a bar and having a drink with humans, etc...). There are tons of characters (ghosts) that bring nothing new to the series. -The series gets boring really quick since 90% of the action is inside the same house (and these are 40-50 minute long episodes).<br/><br/>This is another series that starts great but then someone just remembers to screw it up completely (remember Flashback, Kyle XY or even Lost? Just to name a few). I couldn't bear to see the whole 1st season, it was just too stupid and complete waste of time. Awful!! If we have absorbed the lessons of what independent family dramas have taught us in the past few decades, what have we learned? That Father Has Never "Known Best", that the "Dreams of The Everyday Housewife" can be laced with resentment, disillusionment, fear and madness? That the placid, peaceful, tranquil picture of the all-American family we have believed in (and taught to uphold and emulate) by our own parents, has always been a facade for all kinds of dementia and dysfunction? <br/><br/>If this is true, then what Ryan Murphy has done is taken the clichés of everything from chief competitor Alan Ball's award-winning American BEAUTY and Stephen King's THE SHINING, put them on steroids and blended them together in his word processor. The result? American HORROR STORY, where the only thing more terrifying than a haunted house laden with secrets that rip people to shreds, are the secrets and lies infesting the lives of one family that threaten to rip THEM to shreds.<br/><br/>When a tragic miscarriage and an even more shattering act of infidelity threaten to tear apart their tenuous marriage, Ben Harmon (THE PRACTICE'S Dylan McDermott) and his wife Vivien (FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS' Connie Britton) take their teenage daughter, Violet (Taissa Farmiga) and move away from their "house of horrors" to find a new start somewhere...ANYWHERE that they can put the noxious past behind them and at least try to have a go at tending to their gaping emotional wounds.<br/><br/>The place they choose - or maybe that chooses THEM - a run-down manse on the outskirts of L.A., turns out to be a real bargain, and though irredeemably creepy, does have an antiquated charm...if you're into murals that would give even Hieronymous Bosch nightmares.<br/><br/>In no short order, unsettling and strange characters - as much as the house itself is - begin to materialize and insinuate themselves into the Harmons' lives, whether they want them to or not: next-door neighbor Constance (Jessica Lange in a brilliant turn), whose demeanor suggests a deadly combo of Blanche DuBois, Norma Desmond and Gale Sondergaard's Black Widow; Frances Conroy (Ruth Fisher from SIX FEET UNDER) as the mysterious housekeeper, Moira, who appears to the rest of the family as one persona, while tempting Ben's weakness for "a taste of strange" with another more lascivious presence, (played by Alexandra Breckenridge); Larry Harvey (TRUE BLOOD alum Denis O'Hare), a horribly burned man who seems to be stalking Ben, and who has his own deadly history with the house and what lives there, and Constance's daughter, Adelaide, (Jamie Brewer), with Downs' Syndrome, yet who seems to have it more together - and knows more about the house - than anyone else around her.<br/><br/>Even Ben's practice as a psychologist is fraught with peril, with the introduction of a teen patient named Tate Langdon (Evan Peters), who has an easier time picking apart and savaging the weaknesses in Ben's emotional armor than Ben does in probing his inscrutable and infuriating new charge's troubled mind. Not to mention that his growing fascination/infatuation with Violet doesn't help things one little bit.<br/><br/>Many people have cried fowl about the show's penchant for relying heavily on old horror tropes and clichés, without even paying attention to how it has been taking said clichés and twisting them into newer and even more unsettling shapes than today's average hot mess passing itself off as a 'horror film.' Leave it to FX to allow Murphy and his team - much as they did with NIP/TUCK - the freedom to push the boundaries of where a horror-infused series can go, without the constraints that hog-tied many of the like-minded series that came before it, such as the ground-breaking TWIN PEAKS or American Gothic, (which wasn't anywhere near as well-written as this).<br/><br/>Two episodes in and I am already intrigued, grossed-out and frankly spooked by what I have seen so far. I just hope that the quality continues to get even better as plot lines and characters get darker and more deadly secrets are unearthed... After watching the pilot I wondered if this was meant to be funny? I enjoyed the movie Insidious which was a great mix between comedy and horror. Still it was hard to believe that this show was trying to be funny after all who would want to make jokes about miscarriages and down syndrome? <br/><br/>I gave the series a chance by watching two more episodes but it didn't get better. The plot has more holes than a sieve and it makes you wonder how stupid they take their audience to be? <br/><br/>The characters are so stupid that they do exactly the opposite of what any sane human being would do in every situation they are put into. Not only is this show an insult to anyone's intelligence it is also a complete waste of time-avoid! American Horror works acceptably (until the end) because it keeps so many things in motion--- plots and timelines and things that go bump in the night. Sort of like Heroes (also a 5)-- and no scarier-- the show relentlessly churns and twists to surprising reveal after surprising reveal all delivered with maximum pathos, though a fair share of the performances are good. There is never once a scary moment--- quick cuts and lots of goofy canted shots pretty much guarantee there is never any atmosphere, unless you think music videos are atmospheric. The heavy handed music choices don't help, excepting the cool whistling bit and the piece that sounds stolen from Wojciech Kilar's superb score for (the otherwise crappy) Coppola-directed Dracula (I don't like to put Bram Stoker's name at the front of that one.) <br/><br/>So AHS functions as a fast moving and surprising soap opera with a big budget, some good make up fx and some decent acting, which is why it gets a 5. Actually had the last double length episode not been the series nadir--- really bad dialogue and spacious melodrama that fails utterly--- the show would be slightly north of mediocre, but 'afterbirth' is pretty stinky, and the penultimate episode 'birth' not much better.<br/><br/>Like most Stephen King stuff that I don't like*, it is essentially modern day fantasy with too much explanation of everything so it barely even functions as suspense, much less horror. Ghosts as lead characters who can appear and disappear at will puts this in a camp with things like Ghost (yes, the Swayze one) and Noel Coward's Blithe Spirit. If you think Ghost and Blithe Spirit are horror, then American Horror Story is horror, but I don't (and you shouldn't) even if AHS has occasional gore and burn make up.<br/><br/>Overall, American Horror Story is a mildly engaging soap with better than average acting for a soap and a lot more blood than the average soap, but actually less creepy than the original Dark Shadows show, which actually had atmosphere and let the scenes breathe (and had better music as well).<br/><br/>*Horror guys I dig are the old school of Lovecraft, Blackwood and Machen, and also the visceral and immediate books of high tension storyteller Richard Laymon. I absolutely love the genre of horror, but I feel the ultraviolence of American Horror Story distracts from the psychological elements of true suspense and skin-crawling terror. Hitchcock never needed to mutilate people on screen to scare us.<br/><br/>Season 1 was decent enough, but the talent just wasn't there. When everyone started raving about Season 2 I gave in and gave the show a second chance. Season 2 just tries too hard to be shocking and cutting edge, the same way Hannibal did with an on-screen cannibalistic dinner party. <br/><br/>I'm not even totally opposed to ultraviolence. I love movies like Planet Terror and Machete. Quentin Tarantino does ultraviolence brilliantly in movies like Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. It's in your face, it's raw, but it gives you a balance of violence that feels wrong (rape and mutilation) and violence that feels right (vengeance). As a writer, you have to throw your audience a bone every now and then. I couldn't finish season 2, to be honest. I felt sick watching hour after hour of women being tortured and mutilated and nothing being done about it. The last two series are not true AHS, what a shame the directors think they can live on past shows, just become a comedy show, list direction and list a loyal fan, total rubbish..... I really don't get season 5. They just aired episode 9 in The Netherlands. I am a big fan of the show since the start in 2011, it's such a brilliant idea to have the 'same' fantastic and beautiful cast in different story lines every new season. Back to that awful season 5; I don't like the vampire story, the hotel and it's guests/residents. I am confused about who's dead or not and who is alive or not, who drinks blood and so on and so on. They try to give it a '80s style and lots of Lady GaGa nudity. I am not a prude, I live in Holland and we are used of that kind off things. But I don't get it! The Countess dates/kills guys (actors) who all look the same to me. Who is who? Again confused. I think the makers where so happy to get this 'superstar' on board that they totally where not worried about the plot. Lady GaGa is a good performer, I like her music and her video clips. But acting is something else. Her acting is good, but not perfect. That's it. Jessica Lang, where are you? I love the acting of Evan Peters, does anyone see this guy? He's great! Hope season 6 will be a lot better. More sinister, spooky and not all that stabbing and killing people in every episode. Completely stupid biased Prejudiced and absolutely not scary the most illogical and most absurd television series I have ever seen completely uninteresting and has no plot motive or Story characters are playing boring and even intrusive the series needs to be cancelled the leading and took it off the air YouTube's Netflix and the Webb Honestly the worst series I've ever tried watching. Laughable horror, cheesy set ups and very very predictable. Unlike many reviewers on here, I have waited until the end of the first season to actually review this series as a whole. I want to start off with the Pilot. When I first saw it, I had a lot of problems with it. It was messy, and some of the characters were dumb, and some of the acting was corny. However, after the Pilot ended, I realized just how intrigued I was by it. It sure was a messy Pilot, but that's the beauty of it. It was always moving, it wasn't your typical slow-paced suspense show. <br/><br/>In fact, that pretty much sums up the whole season. This is a crackling, fast-paced and entertaining horror series. I would never call this high- art, but that's what makes it great. The show doesn't take itself seriously at all, and it always remains fun, even when it's silly, and yet you get really invested in the story lines and characters. Sure, the performances are flawed at times, and the writing and directing awkward, but the fast pace in every episode doesn't ever let the viewer gasp for air. This is the true definition of a thrill ride. It also feels very experimental. It executes a lot of things in very unordinary ways, in ways that no other TV show does. It doesn't always succeed, but even when it doesn't, you can appreciate it. <br/><br/>Your friends might call The Walking Dead the better horror show, but I disagree. As far as Pilots go, no matter how entertaining or thrilling American Horror Story's Pilot was, the Pilot for The Walking Dead was better, masterful in every way. Since then, it's merely a good, sometimes great, TV show. It takes itself more seriously and is slower-paced, but it's problem is that a lot of times the writing just feels stale, recycled. You are intrigued by it, but it sometimes feels weaker than it should be. And the fact that it takes itself too seriously sort of dampens the fun one should be having with it, simply because its writing isn't strong enough to stretch out its story lines (like the two best TV shows on air, Mad Men and Breaking Bad, do). American Horror Story is better for these reasons- each episode by itself is exciting, it's always moving, and instead of trying to slow things down and makes its flaws more apparent, it even overdoes things on purpose. Messy, sure, silly, sometimes, but overall more intriguing, funner, and more exciting. I cannot wait for the second season of this, since I thought the resolution to the story of the first season was excellent, as well as the final shot. <br/><br/>P.S. Oh, I also want to add another note to take. The performances do hit their great marks, but the only truly incredible performance is Jessica Lange. Her character and performance makes all other supporting turns in television look stale by comparison, and all of her scenes are truly gold! She needs to win that Emmy next year! I want to see her back! So after two episodes of season 8 I am left wondering where the horror is. Are they indicating that perversity is spooky and homosexuals are monsters? Why even put that out there? I thought this was a horror show, not a sex show. What's with all the gay sex and gay talk? I am personally bisexual and currently with a same sex partner. I didn't want to sit and watch a show that makes gay people look like freaks. We sat to watch a HORROR show. Demons, mythology etc. If I wanted a gay education show to watch with them for their understanding I would go to the library. This show has gone downhill every season. Freak show was insulting where we were treated to episode after episode of physically disabled people being the shows monsters each week. Nice! How scary! Then we were treated to an awful rendition of the political atmosphere with unrealistic characters, painting our fellow Americans who have voted in the president of their choosing as MONSTERS! Now we have the gay agenda this season. Are we going into the racism theme next season??? Either way we won't be watching. This show is no longer worth viewing and Channel Zero is a far more serious horror anthology series! Fourth season coming!!!! Gross out city with no redeeming value. Garbage.
Jessica Lange is creepily good, but that's about it. She can't carry horrible stories. I have decided to watch this series, on account of the generally favourable reviews and furthermore, because I found the idea of filming a second season for a horror TV series a recommendation in itself. After the tedious labor of watching every second of the pilot, I found all the rants and raves for this show completely unjustified. As a matter of fact, everything about it is unjustified except for the title, of course. American Horror Story is the perfect choice, since the series embodies all the cliché themes of the horror movies that keep sprouting out of Hollywood every fall. A family haunted by the ghosts of the past, an even more haunted house, tales of murder and madness, the shadows of whom still lurk between the walls. Indeed, an overdone cocktail of clichés such as this couldn't have possibly failed as miserably as its predecessors on the big screen. The first two episodes where more than sufficient to convince me of the lack of quality of the show. The choice of actors is a particularly applaudable example of severe miscast. The Dylan McDermott we all know and love for his ability to perform without credibility and traces of mimic, an underacting and boring Connie Britton, the teen actress Taissa Farminga, who fails to develop her character into a believable teenager, Evan Peters, who actually manages to turn the psychopath he is supposed to portray into a laughable goth poser (without the outfit, naturally) and Jessica Lange, who seems to have put just enough effort into her character as to alternate from scene to scene between the former roles of Blanche DuBois and Martha Baring. The fact that the story is concoction of horror movie clichés cannot be stressed enough, yet I must make a short comment on the dialogue: each scene gave me the impression that the script was nothing more than a collage of dialogues from the other Hollywood failures of the horror genre, some gore and some scary face popping on the screen (to the horror movie fan's dismay, not quite difficult to predict). That's the way a multitude of clichés tend to affect the viewer. The utter lack of suspense and the ridiculous soundtrack (out of context for almost every scene), added to the above mentioned (mis)cast and the plot rightfully accompany my decision to not take this series seriously and to not recommend it. Season 9 is mind numbingly inane. This is what happens to a decent series when you stop hiring writers. The biggest waste of time on TV. Season 8 started so good! Panic everywhere, nuclear bombs falling and destroying everything in ther way. The misterious Michael from "The Cooperative". The outpost where great too. But we got 2 episodes, maybe 3 (and I'm being generous) of Apocalypse, the other 7 or 8 were Coven season 2.<br/><br/>And I really wanted Michael to succed because he's the antichrist, come on. A coven of 6 witches vs THE Antichrist, the witches stand no chance. Buuuuuut AHS may think differently.. they gave the witches a spell that allowed them to time-travel (seriously?) and the best part is that no-one knew about it until episode 9 (i believed). If Cordelia knew about this spell why would she'd left Queenie to rot in the Cortez? She was THE supreme back then and there was no Mallory, so she would've been in full power.<br/><br/>I think the worst part is that they made the witches won by an unfair used of the plot (time-travel spell, Mallory not dying in the last episode, killing the antichrist with a carcrash (are you kidding me??) He wasnt in full power but come on! A carcrash?<br/><br/>And at the end everyone is affraid of Mallory because she kills a weaker version of the antichrist, sure. Why not? This show was awesome from Season 1. Now unfortunately it is nothing but a conservative bashing, liberal feminist dramedy. That's too bad because the actors in this series are great. I've been a big fan of AHS since the beginning, but 1984 is starting to lose me. First, it's not even remotely scary. The 2 main killers are probably the most un-frightening characters AHS has ever concocted. Then, all of a sudden, the victims become ghosts and killers themselves which makes no sense. This iteration of AHS had plenty of potential, but was squandered by lazy writing. I have been a fan of this series for years, but series 8 makes no sense whatsoever. It jumps around, not in a clever way...it's like they started filming without a script or plot and made it up (badly) as they went along but got thoroughly lost. Utterly terrible - time you won't get back as most of us can't time travel. So I've written a review on the last episode but it didn't made the cut. I've written all the things down I liked and what I didn't like. So let's try it again!<br/><br/>I was a big fan of ahs but last seasons left me kind of dissapointed. I don't get the 10 reviews cause imho it wasn't that great. Or maybe I just don't get it.<br/><br/>I thought the story was really boring and predictable and they focussed too much on the sjw stuff. It kind of ruined it.<br/><br/>So this season was just the same and predictable and the story was very thin. If you liked season 3 coven then maybe this is for you. But strong characters were lame and undeveloping in last season and the story went nowhere. It was just fan service and had nothing to do with the 'apocalypse'.<br/><br/>I never got into the story (I watched all episodes in one row), and it was predictable and It never surprised me. I kind of hoped at every episode that it will get better, but it just never got better.<br/><br/>Lazy writing and a stupid 'apocalypse' story. Pay attention to my 'sarcasm'.<br/><br/>And the ending left me saying LOL and WTF. My language. Change mind!<br/><br/>Greetings from The Netherlands x At last they've come up with a great haunted house story. Not too much gore, just creepy eeriness. The writing is great, the story leaves you wondering what is going on. (Spoilers) They deal with real issues like infidelity, miscarriage, teen angst, down syndrome, although that little girl is not your typical down syndrome child. However, her mother, played by Jessica Lange is fabulous. A polite, albeit pushy southern bell type, yet, "If you touch my child again, I'll break your arm". I love the house, starting in 1978 when it was decrepit, and falling apart, to present day when it has been completely refurbished. I would love to explore a house like that. The use of split second visions, leaves you wondering, what did I just see? I think this is going to be a great series, I can't wait for more! I just finished watching Season One based on the recommendations from many friends.<br/><br/>I was under the impression that this was an anthology show - that every episode would be a different scary story with different characters. So i was a little disappointed when I realized it was a season-long story. Oh well, we'd watch it anyway with open minds. An ongoing story line could still be scary.<br/><br/>However, this was not scary. There were a few creepy scenes, but that's about it. Each episode starts with a little scene from the past to establish where the ghosts came from. The show could have been helped A LOT by focusing more on THOSE stories rather than the house's current residents - an annoying Bostonian psychiatrist and his family. There is so much they could have done with this show - but didn't. <br/><br/>Even though I had been less than impressed with the show, I made it through the season and still held some expectations for the final episode. Unfortunately, the final episode was the worst of the lot. The ending was a terrible, predictable, cop-out leaving a number of loose ends. The last two seasons have make a huge turn for the worse. Season 7 was mostly about politics and made bashing Trump supporters and making them out to be lunatics the main focus of the story line. The ending saw a weak woman overcome her fears to defeat the patriarchy of political power.<br/><br/>Season 8 is even more PC-themed with a group of witches who have their differences but are united by the female bond to once again unite against the men-witches, most of whom want nothing more than to put subdue them and some even want to destroy the world.<br/><br/>Would have been better to keep agendas out of this show, as they really shine through and make it both predictable, and catered to a teen-vogue type of audience. Loved it - it has everything a horror buff would want to see - possession, aliens, goriness, mutants, experiments and much more ALL UNDER ONE ASYLUM !! Loved it to the core ! Also loved the eerie song - dominiquee !! This one was wayyyy better than season one ! Season one has lots of loose ends and lots of questions even after the season finale but this season even ended well. Everything falls into place or is taken care off. However I did feel they killed a few characters earlier than required but no real complaints. I was glued - I just could not stop watching. I saw the whole season back to back in 2 days straight. Really looking forward to season 3. This show has few good things going for it. The cast, with the exception of McDermott, give good performances. The cinematography is excellent and there's a lot of atmosphere. And that's about it.<br/><br/>The mood of this show is suffocating, to put it lightly. Each episode is one weird thing after another with no rest. That leads to a lack of real suspense. The camera work is over the top, and the musical cues try way too hard.<br/><br/>Ultimately, though, it's the plot that fails this show. As I said before, there's an endless stream of weird things happening, which means you never get an ounce of suspense or tension. But worse than that, all the weird things that happen are typical horror movie tropes that we've seen a hundred times before in other horror projects.<br/><br/>The following paragraph contains details that some may consider spoilers: The story steals a lot from The Shining and quite a bit from Amityville Horror. The basic concept of a haunted house where all the previous owners were killed is about as stale as you can get. The Simpsons parodied it some ten years ago. To make it worse, they throw in every other cliché they can find. We've got creepy things in the attic and creepy things in the basement. We've got an obsessive ex-girlfriend. There's a man who's been horribly disfigured in a fire who happens to wear a black suit and drive a black sedan, which leads to an incredibly schlocky chase scene. There's a home invasion a la The Strangers or Straw Dogs or any of a million other movies. There's a conniving, evil neighbor and a mentally handicapped girl. There are college students getting stabbed to death by a serial killer and a mad scientist who likes to cut up animals and sew their parts together (not hard to imagine where that's going). About the only things missing are werewolves and vampires.<br/><br/>And the worst part of it all: the show is just barely entertaining. During the Halloween marathon I watched the first three episodes and was so unconcerned with what was going on that I decided to find something else to watch. There's no real mystery and very little about the characters to care about. You are basically just watching things happen to them. I'm usually the sort of person who wants to know how things will end and will watch even a mediocre show to find out. With American Horror Story I found myself not caring how it turns out at all. American Horror Story is an attempt to take the horror movie from the big screen to a weekly to drama. It has the elements of a story akin to The Amityville Horror or A Haunting in Connecticut where a family moves into a new home filled with a sinister past that has a habit of rearing its ugly head. The families ignore the history and give the homes a try anyway only to find themselves wrapped in a terrifying mystery. <br/><br/>American Horror Story focuses on the Harmon family who is moving from Boston to Los Angeles to escape their past. Vivien Harmon (Connie Britton) is still reeling from the miscarriage of her baby boy and the subsequent affair she caught her husband having to "cope" with the loss. Ben Harmon (Dylan McDermott) is a psychiatrist who is trying to escape his mistake of sleeping with one of his college students and the rift it has caused in his marriage. Violet (Taissa Farmiga) their daughter is disgusted with her parents and the move but loves the house and its sinister past. <br/><br/>The plot only thickens as the cast grows. Tate Langdon (Evan Peters) is one of Ben's new patients who shows not only an interest in Violet but an unusual amount of knowledge about the house. Constance (Jessica Lange) is the Harmons' next door neighbor and seems to have no problem not only speaking her mind but being pushy and threatening. Last but not least Larry Harvey (Denis O'Hare), a former owner of the Harmons' house, starts to follow Ben and warn him about the house. Larry had murdered his entire family in that house and he warns Ben that if he's not careful that house will change him and may make him do something he wouldn't otherwise do. <br/><br/>This show is a really creative idea. To be honest it's strange to me that no one has ever tried to do something like this before. It has all of the normal concepts and ideas that keep you coming back to a normal drama series, but it has the added element of a horror movie. So you not only get the mystery but the ghosts and the murders. It's nice because you don't only get one type of horror movie. You get ghosts, you get slasher, you get possession type horror like Larry who ended up killing his family. The show appeals to all tastes of horror.<br/><br/>One of the things that could be better is that there are just so many characters that seem to know something about the house and they also seem to know each other. This makes things a little confusing. The writers are probably trying to keep the audience interested but this particular collection of twists is a little confusing. Maybe as the series unfolds it will become clearer. <br/><br/>Someone that really loves horror movies will love this show. It keeps your attention with all of the twists and turns. This show takes an amazing genre of films and allows an audience to have a new weekly addiction. It's a great mystery/horror fix. Season 8 is just trash. Makes no sense. Save yourself.the frustration and skip this season. This show is at its end. Firstly, this is an anthology series, which makes it a little bit more difficult in judging it as a "whole" series, since each season is, essentially, a mini-series in its own right.<br/><br/>Overall I find this series to be "good", but this is not showing the picture clearly enough because the seasons do vary, and they vary greatly in my opinion.<br/><br/>Season 1 – Murder House is "Very Good" with 9/10 Season 2 – Asylum is "Exceptionally Good" with 10/10 Season 3 – Coven is "Fine" with 7/10 Season 4 – Freak Show is "Underwhelming" with 6/10 It is worth mentioning that Murder House set the standards quite high while Asylum delivered above and beyond, where it truly was an American Horror Story.<br/><br/>However, without going into much detail about the latter two seasons, I believe where the writers and/or producers have gone slightly wrong, is that they focused more on attaining characters for the actors to play rather than actors for the characters to be played by. This in conjunction with losing a lot, and I mean quite a lot of the "horror" factor and producing less of a cohesive and evolving "story" they created two instalments of an American Horror Story... where only the "American" part was more or less true.<br/><br/>This is not to say that Coven and Freak Show were bad "mini-series", they were both watchable, the former more so than the latter but they were not well produced, despite the potential.<br/><br/>(UPDATE) <br/><br/>Season 5 – Hotel is "Substandard" with 5/10 <br/><br/>Unfornatunely, the latest instalment of the AHS, Hotel, did not reclaim the past seasons' former standards, worse still, this season, was even poorer than its previous predecessor, as I personally feel, hence the overall rating from me for AHS will now go to 7/10 as just "okay". While the general "film" aspects such as the filming, audio, editing, production, style etc. remained fine – not the best but certainly not the worst, the rest that comes with making a series seriously lacked almost everything.<br/><br/>The story, which ironically the series boasts in its very title, lacked tremendously; once again it felt incoherent, inconsistent, insipid and this time had even more plot-holes than even a patient viewer, such as myself, can allow to pass. There were so many things wrong with the design of the characters – some of them felt so extremely "forced", as in, it felt like they didn't really fit into the "story" (if you want to call it that) but the producers pushed them in just so that they can get the actor/actress from the past involved, after looking back that's seriously a big issue.<br/><br/>It's actually rather difficult to put into words how bad this season is, and while I can barely understand why it may still appeal to some, it is safe to say that the majority of us will agree that this was not the best of AHS.<br/><br/>I think the people behind this show may be allowing their "success" get into their heads; it seems the fact that AHS is quite popular and the fact that it is an anthology series makes them a little more careless, as if to say "if we f*** up we can forget this season because it's an anthology and plus we are popular anyway". I hope that's not the case, but it really does come across that way more and more. This season deserved one star, but I gave it two for the sake of the 80s. Number 1, characters are poorly written, not much depth tbh. 2. Emma Roberts is great at playing bad characters, otherwise she's kinda... expressionless. Don't even get me started about great actors leaving the hell out of this show. 3. Not much of a good story either. Let me tell you; it had a potential. I've noticed how recent seasons usually have a great base for the plot. So you get hooked on episode 1 and that's it. That's usually the climax of the season. Those first few episodes. Maybe I'm too sentimental towards previous seasons, but this is definitely getting worse season by season. I will admit I liked all the previous seasons but this first episode of the 80s sleepaway camp is terrible.
I couldnt manage 15 mins straight . The pastels the music the actors , it's just bad.. The first few seasons were amazing, dark, mysterious and just overall kept your attention. After coven, it's just gone completely downhill. I attempted to watch half of the first episode of the newest season, Apocalypse and it's just aweful. Cult was so disappointing. Roanoke was unnecessarily gory and just got dumb once they turned it into a "reality show". Circus was so slow and just got worse once they killed off the clown (forget his characters name). It's just disappointing to see a show that started off so well just become an utter loss. I'll keep this short, if you are thinking of investing time in this series i would highly recommend the first two seasons but don't waste your time with the third or fourth as they are totally different and a real let down considering the strong start. The first two series have great story lines and plots and then it all goes wrong after that. One of the problems is that they keep using the same actors and therefore it's difficult to engage with them as different characters but the major issue is the sloppy, lazy writing in the third and fourth series. They aren't scary and by the fourth they are reliant on gore and violence to try to get a scare from the audience, when that happens in any horror tale you know they've hit the wrong note in terms of the writing. Hope that helps.. The first episode of season 8 was interesting. The following episodes were terrible. It picked up later in the season and there were some good ideas but after watching the last episode you realise that the whole season has been a waste of time, the ending was a major disappointment and a big writing cop out. It could of and should of been a lot better. There were too many stories running at once. Actors playing multiple characters. The next season should focus on a simplistic horror story focusing on the plot and story arc. The first 3 series are great but at this point there are more bad series than good ones, freak show felt pointless and the musical numbers incredible forced, hotel was okay but dragged on for far too long and became a confusing mess, roanoke was a disaster with the exception of the terrible underused Kathy Bates and Cult started off with promise but again ended up in its own backside, I've no hope for this new series. I really liked episode pilot and think this season gonna be great but after eps 4,5 and now 8 i realized this not gonna be good, another pointless boring episode, cant denied this season plot really weak but getting weaker with each episode with terrible story, some eps just like filler with nothing happen, i thought roanoke was the best horrible season but this ?? hope the final episode really turn the table or just cancel this show before it's become soooo terrible and disgrace. I love horror genre especially with twisted stories, but while the first few seasons were great, the last several are down right incoherent. It seems they are going out of their way to make the just come up with bizarre crap and then try to weave a story through it. I think it is time to put a nail in this and bury it. I watched the first episode and honestly I don't see the appeal. The story-line is not interesting, the characters are annoying and it's just not scary. The screenwriters have a serious creative problem so they are mixing all the horror stereotypes you can find in the genre and mashing-up the previous with all the annoying moral and ethic situations you will meet in everyday newspapers. Put together racism, serial killers, crazy doctors, aliens, zombies, ghosts, unspeakable remorses, experiments, exorcisms, homosexuality, interracial love, profane religious situations, sexual scenes, mutant, slaughters, sm/db hints, kidnapping, tortures, street gangs, strong language.. all in just 3 episodes. I expect in the next ones to meet werewolves, the Loch Ness monster, voo-doo, giant insects, jason, freddie krueger, cenobites, organs market, the blair witch project, a virus, the sacrifice of a kid, Satan gangs, an atomic bomb hidden under the holy virgin and maybe the resurrection of Hitler. The script is SO WEAK that I'd rather watch a Z- movie instead. Watch "666 Park Avenue" and see how a clean script with a nice studied idea can make you enjoy a TV horror series. AHS Asylum is just too pretentious and the only reason to watch it is the living myth Jessica Lange. The answer: "No." As if music videos, reality shows and Jerry Springer hadn't already done enough to lower middle class standards, FX has unleashed on us something we've never seen: A series featuring surly, under-groomed characters whose melodramatic, soap tedium is underscored with migraine-inducing hard rock. How refreshing.<br/><br/>"American Horror Story" nevertheless deserves a pat on the back. Like AMC's equally derivative "Walking Dead," it has mesmerized audiences into thinking they're actually seeing something relevant when in fact they're really not. In an era when TV has degenerated into a plethora of cooking shows, "lifestyle" programming and "Honey Boo Boo" reality, anything scripted--albeit crudely in this case--seems like an event of great importance by comparison.<br/><br/>Like all cable TV series, "American Horror Story" excels at taking seven minutes of whisper-thin plot and dragging it out to pad a full episode's runtime. This comes in handy if you feel like making a three course meal while it's on; you won't miss anything.<br/><br/>One star for its "much ado about nothing" status. Seasons 1-4 were all great. I gave AHS rave reviews in the past. Watched Apocalyspe and couldn't get past 3 episodes. The acting was so stupid, especially that new blond actress that acts like a cartoon character (don't know her name but she also plays Margaret in 1984). Watching 1984 now and it's still silly and stupid. Not what it used to be, scary and intense. I think I'm done. Started strong but got progressively more and more ridiculous. These last two seasons have been particularly inane and self-absorbed. I must admit that initially I was very impressed with this program. It seemed to tick all the right boxes and had some very solid performances and characterisation from several of the actor/esses So I started watching it looking forward to the next episode and was wondering quite what would happen next in this adult series that was also well produced.<br/><br/>However, it did start to become predictable in that if you thought... what is the worst that can happen now ? then lo and behold ... that was precisely what did. So instead of it being, in the main, a good entertaining and well made horror story it became something else. It became, in my view, a laughable parody of itself which lacked any shock factor and consequently it's novelty value.<br/><br/>Perhaps I'm too critical and you may enjoy it. Sadly, I didn't last the full series as it became tedious and predictable. shame Seasons 1-4 are great. 5 was decent but 6 and 7 in my opinion have been so boring. I just watched season 8 Episode 1 and I think it's gonna suck. Such a shame when a great show don't know when to end it. It's like a boxer that fights to long and ends up with brain damage. All of the past seasons were wonderfully spooky and entertaining. But, this year's "Roanoke" was just plain ridiculous. It was convoluted, the story line was what?....to be scary? No. The writers really went off the rails with this year's story. It was not in keeping with the past seasons of this show. It was not a "horror" story. To tell the truth I don't know what it was. Except for just plain stupid. If you have another season like this one, you'll for sure get canceled. And that would be a shame. Please, Please, Please...get back to the "horror" that this show was intended to be. Boring, boring and yawn. I want to see more of what the past has been. You really blew it this year. Dammit. When will it stop? Anyone and everyone dies and I didn't give a rat's ass. Almost everyone in the neighborhood has, at some point, lived at "Murder House" and evidently still has a key because they come and go at random with little to no protest from the owners. Our Matriarch, Vivian, is pregnant with the antichrist because she was raped by the ghost of a local school shooter whose Steel Dragnolia mother (Jessica Lange) acts as the family's nosy neighbor/woman with a dark past and former owner of this effing haunted house. Eventually, Vivian's demon spawn is delivered by the ghosts inside the house and she dies in childbirth and becomes a ghost herself, which is just dandy because her wasty faced, emo daughter killed herself over a month ago from a drug overdose, but everyone can still see her so it's not like it's a big deal or anything. The chick in the French maid uniform (who, for some reason was murdered when she was young but is still aging as a ghost) is the only reason I think anyone who isn't a manic depressive teenage girl would bother to finish watching this crap because the plot is all over the place. American Horror Story has always been one of my favorite shows. Each season holds a special place in my heart and means so much to me, all serve their own purpose in telling a story of fright. I love that it is anthology style with completely different story lines and characters but using the same variety of actors, this is one of the best setups for a series I have ever seen! Season 9: 1984 was amazing and delivered everything it needed to, it did a great job at portraying a classic 80's slasher film. The amount of Gore mixed with sadness mixed with comedy was perfect and this season needed to happen! Apparently I'm on the outside of what's popular. This uses a few ONG scenes and crazy stupid time shifts to hide the fact that there are no stories here. Far from even coming close to being original storytelling, this ludicrous "I-See-Dead-People" TV series repeatedly used the tactics of mercilessly clubbing the viewer over the noggin with one ghost-story clichÃ© after another.<br/><br/>With the most contrived skeletons hanging in just about everybody's closet, it soon became pretty clear to me that the producers of American Horror Story (AHS, for short) had absolutely no respect for the intelligence of its targeted audience.<br/><br/>Disappointing, oppressive, annoying, erratic, AHS's heavy-handed approach to its trendy tales of terror, far too often, got itself so bogged down with gloom & doom that it quickly began to grate on my nerves like you wouldn't believe.<br/><br/>Underhandedly using sexual situations and brief glimpses of nudity (both male & female) as a means of spicing up its less-than-frightening scenarios, AHS was a decidedly dull-edged TV program that, otherwise, frequently hit absolute rock-bottom in the realm of terror.<br/><br/>I am completely baffled by the rave reviews and solid 8-star ratings that AHS has collectively garnered for itself.<br/><br/>And, finally - I think that Jessica Lange should retire from performing in front of a camera. This woman has clearly not aged well and her performance in AHS was atrociously bad. If like me you are sick to death of wokeness ruining every aspect of the modern cinematic experience then avoid the latter half of AHS. I wish writers/directors would realise that people watch to escape, not to get more political bullsh!t thrown at them. I would not necessarily call this series bad, but it's terribly boring. Overall ratings:<br/><br/>Season 1: 5/10. Season 2: 8/10. Season 3: 4/10.<br/><br/>I don't understand how this show has a rating of 8.4 Sure, season 2 was pretty great. It lost its pace a bit when the antagonists died out mid-way, but it was still thrilling and well made. But as for season 1 and 3...<br/><br/>What the hell were they thinking? Season 1 started out promising but soon became more of a ghost drama than a horror movie. With every episode my hope diminished.<br/><br/>And don't get me started on season 3. It's like it was written by an impulsive teenager. The effects and cinematography are good, but it really has NO consistency. The writers sacrificed consistency and plot accuracy for cheap thrills. For example, let's take Madison's death. She was choked to death by the overused Tate-guy. THEY'RE WITCHES! In the very first episode of season 3 Madison flips a god-damned bus using her powers. But apparently any old human can choke these almighty witches to death and they can't do a thing. Nearing the conclusion all of the protagonists suddenly have a multiple of powers which they did not have before. They literally appear out of nowhere. And let's not forget the oh-so-useless Cordelia.. whoops, I mean the supreme. I think i'm pretty right in saying that they wrote her to be the supreme at the very last second. Because up until that point all that fool could do was grow plants.<br/><br/>The writers of this show are WAY in over their heads. Desperately trying to be over-achievers, and failing miserably. Everyone around me is seeing something in this show that I can't. I'll admit that the first and second episode of the first season were passable after the first viewing, but it all went downhill from there. Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk simply cannot write. I try to overlook all of the stupid, subtly over the top lines but it's impossible. There are just too many ha ha. Even if I could, they break one of the most important rules in writing television and movie: show, don't tell. Within the first few minutes of the season three premiere, Taissa Farmiga's character, Zoe, says "So, apparently I'm a . Aside from that, the acting is sometimes melodramatic and terrible, yet the actors are ones that I normally enjoy: at least to some of them. The storyline like the show in general is disorganized. Pointless, unnecessary things tended to be piled on and on until I just stopped caring. Sorry to be so harsh. No judgment, watch away ;] I just don't understand. Sadly the show is getting worse and worse.... now i can completly see why jessica lange left (what a smart woman) ... and now ahs 1984 ..ugh... some old cast members were also smart not to join.
Season 1-3 were really cool and refreshing... than it got worse... well the freakshow was ok. BUt than... ugh even lady gaga couldn's save it. sorrY.I hope the next one will be better.. (it won't be hard to make that happen). (First i had 10 stars now dropping to 5) cause 5 of 9 seasons were not good, some not good at all. Brad and Ryan, I hate to say it but I guess you should have quit while you were ahead. This show used to be great, I've been a huge fan since the moment I heard about its conception. I craved a new creepy show after I had finished Twin Peaks, and for a few seasons American Horror Story really delivered with creative stories and excellent acting, yes, in large part thanks to the queen Jessica Lange. However, season 6 is falling apart at the seams. I gave it a chance, but this most recent episode "Flicker" just had me shaking my head. It seems the writers don't know who really makes up big portions of their audience, which is evident when they try to insert the great filmmakers of yesteryear into their clumsy storyboard. F.W. Murnau would surely not appreciate his masterpiece Nosferatu being mentioned in the company of such rushed writing including a "twist" that, if ALL the fans are correct in advance, will have been visible a mile away. It's especially offensive considering your huge fan base of 13-17 year old girls who you don't seem to acknowledge, and who don't know or care who he is. This would all be forgivable, but I was left wondering why on earth this new 90 year old character is being played by the same actor who ALREADY PLAYED an important character in the show. Did you run out of budget to hire another one? Was this supposed to be confusing? Will this be explained, albeit too late to make any sense? Everyone is a vampire and there are no rules anymore, at least for the writers it seems. At least for me, things have just gotten too silly on the show to enjoy. I guess it was the last straw when it seemed that they were messing everything up while incorporating techniques from classic films when, more than ever this season, it's clear that the two shouldn't be compared. Same incredibly talented mainstay actors that make AHS a must watch. But Apocalypse is unwatchable. I used to consider AHS a psychological edge of your seat thriller. Apocalypse is just sellout silliness. Over three seasons, this show continues to come along with very exciting premises, and then (at varying times throughout each season) falls apart at the seems.<br/><br/>Ryan Murphy seems to be incapable of reigning it in. Rather than focus on all the good he has, especially in season 3, he manages, in 13 episodes to throw even more in, discarding stories he might find boring without tying them up, writing things into a corner so that they're forgotten about the next week to allow the story to continue, killing and reviving and killing and reviving, not to mention the stupidly confusing choices the characters make along the way.<br/><br/>So let's begin with the biggest waste this season: Fiona Goode. Jessica Lange has created, until now, two successful anti-heroes. Both were twisted and cynical but also possessed a capacity for love (albeit of a bizarre manner). Fiona Goode, her character in this season, is nothing but a tired rehash of those two women; same mannerisms, same accent, same attitude. She murders a young girl in one instant and then revives a still-born baby the next. Then she repeats the cycle again. There's only so many times a viewer can be bothered sympathising or hating someone. Along the way, one just gets bored.<br/><br/>The next biggest disappointments occur in two new additions to the cast: Angela Basset and Kathy Bates. Both do so much with what they're offered (Kathy eventually just reprising Annie Wilkes and Angela as the sassy black sidekick) that it ruins the entire season (how, if a casting director or even show creator can find nothing more to do with two gifted veteran actors can he possibly have had any idea of what to do with the show in the first place?). It's sickening, really. Kathy plays the villain Madame LaLaurie who was cursed by Angela's Marie Laveau to live forever. Entombed beneath New Orleans, LaLaurie is released by Fiona to discover the secret of youth. However, when Marie Laveau discovers that LaLaurie was released, she sends her demon army after the coven.<br/><br/>LaLaurie, clearly a psychopath, spends most of the season repenting and learning from the African American witch, Queenie. So it's bizarre that she spends so long repenting when she's devoid of feelings (what a waste of ten episodes to discover what we already knew). Marie Laveau, probably the most grey of the characters in this season, laments the passing of her minotaur pet who she set out to kill the Salem witches. She then bangs on about a truce being broken by the Salem witches. Honey, I don't want to go all first grade on you but you broke the truce first! Apparently, she had been breaking it for a while. So, who exactly are we supposed to support in this cluster-mug?<br/><br/>Surely it must be the young students of the Coven?!? Four young women all nearing the edge of reason who require nothing more than a wrong look to kill someone? Who kill and revive one another and then eventually just kill one another? Who love to soliloquise the end of the Coven and of the Witch line whilst they maim and murder and brutalise themselves and others publicly? Yeah, they seem a safe bet...<br/><br/>Maybe it's the supporting cast we should root for? Misty Day, Chordelia SpiritFingers or Myrtle? Whilst the least offensive of the cast, they also seem the most useless. Misty has the power to revive people and spends her days dancing to Stevie Nicks in a swamp until a Witch Hunter tries to kill her. Then she just gets killed at the coven, anyway. Chordelia SpiritFingers is the headmistress of the school and Coven and daughter of Fiona. She seems nice. I mean, she spends her days in a garden doing nothing but crying about how useless she is whilst her charges burn down houses, flip buses, shag men to death and force the neighbours to ingest bleach... Then she gets the power of sight (you might think she'd become proactive) but can't even figure out that her husband is a Witch Hunter (maybe it's poetic that she's blinded by her love of him, I just found it sloppy writing). Myrtle, Myrtle Myrtle Myrtle. Frances Conroy is the one thing I like about this season. She's batty. She's cookie. She's just plain nuts. She's also highly entertaining. However, like the other two, she kinda just dies and then comes back only to die again. She also melon balls some eye balls and looks peachy doing it. Guess that's alright.<br/><br/>So, to cap this off, this season is a mess. If you read this and thought "Gee, he sounds messy," I won't take responsibility. I've tried to linearise the plot strands. It's impossible. It's messy. It's confused. It's full of style and contains no substance. I applaud an almost all female cast but when they're reduced to bickering over men, murdering children for their youth or backstabbing one another for power, I can't help but feel they must all be ashamed. I know I'd be. The quote that immediately comes to mind after first watching this show comes from Ghostbusters. When Dean Yeager is throwing Dr. Peter Venkman out of the university at the beginning of the movie. He says<br/><br/>"Your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe, your methods are sloppy, and your conclusions are highly questionable."<br/><br/>Even out of context, this quote is still appropriate for the creators of this show.<br/><br/>HOW do people find this crap scary? Anyone who has ever seen even a bad horror movie should be able to see every plot twist 10 miles away. This show is extremely cliché! Ryan Murphy is trying way too hard!! Some of the greatest horror movies ever made were extremely scary for one reason...they were SIMPLE!! If you are looking for a show that is really scary, or with a really good plot, look somewhere else. However, if you are someone who saw Scream 4 on opening night, and are currently dying to see Paranormal Activity 3, this may be the show for you. This whole 2nd season was a joke. I continued to watch painfully longing for it to, at some point, get better. I was obsessed with the plot in season 1 and I impatiently waited for season 2 in order to satisfy my addiction. Episode 1 of season 2 left me greatly disappointed and somewhat clueless. In the end I was more terrified by the woman sitting next to me with tears in her eyes rather than the, supposed, "horror" piece on my television screen. At this point I wonder whether the writer's next move is to pick up where season 1 left off or go in an entirely new direction yet again. Either way I don't care. As for me and my house - we shall not watch. American Horror Story is a thing of the past. I am in agreement this show has lost it's edge. AHS used to be a really good show, it was different it told a story and yes it had its horror plots but now it's starting to get really cheesy. I believe it's becoming more of a TRY TO SHOCK YOU instead of telling a story type of show.
I understand that it might get a little difficult to try to be creative to think of something new and different each and every year but this AHS 1984 is just really bad so far. I hope it
will pick up speed as the episodes progress like some of the other previous seasons have. Mr. Ryan Murphy, I appreciate you being a gay advocate and trying to place
gay actors and actresses in the stories not only as actors but as actual characters. However, it is becoming more of the story line instead of being horror/suspense.
It doesn't matter if a character is gay.
The show should be based more on trying to be scary, trying to be suspenseful, and trying to tell a story. Please stop making them overtly sexual, particularly the male characters. The show is now just overly sexual moments (straight/gay) and with good and bad moments of TV horror. The acting this year is flat and not great. You need your originals back.
Yawn.......... I feel like a part of my life has been stolen from me by watching the season apocalypse. Firstly the episodes where it's just a group of survivors were actually alright, it was engaging and i actually wanted to know what happened next. Then they kill everyone and i'm left thinking what was the point in spending multiple episodes on these people if they're just never going to be mentioned again or have any importance to the plot. Only two of the survivors matter and have any actual impact on the season. When Coven came into the season, it took a nosedive from three thousand miles in the air. For some reason they decide to spend the rest of the season in a backstory to what happened in the first episodes, which to me is very strange, I think it would've been much better if they started out with the lead up to the apocalypse but whatever. From then on they explain the origins of the main bad guy Langdon which all ends up irrelevant in the end because they use the biggest cop out ending of all time. Time travel. Time travel just doesn't work in this season, all it leads to is making none of the entire season matter. All that happens in the ending is she kills a young Landon who is then reborn in a different kid. How about instead of copping out with time travel they actually do something cool like using their powers to beat him, we were shown in earlier episodes that Mallory was a very strong witch who scared Langdon so why didn't she at least try to fight him. If they were just going to go back in time to kill him anyway, why didn't they just do that the moment they found out he was evil, this season makes no sense at all.<br/><br/>In short, No characters matter, No decisions matter, Nothing in the story matters, a good part of AHS is that all the seasons wrap themselves up, this season lead nowhere and ended in a similar place to where it started. I see no point in recommending this season to anyone unless you want to be disappointed. Started out interesting. It's devolved into a made for Lifetime mini series. Trouncing out Stevie Nicks for a full solo performance finally broke my back on this season This documentary style used in this season causes nothing but a huge disconnect from flow of the story which feels like the Blair Witch Project, the characters and the interviews, and overall intense connection of each moment to that of the interviews. This gives away the suspense with these "So called" interviews that just tells us that they must have all survived. DEAL BREAKER! Now imagine taking the interviews out of the post edits, and then see what we get. I wish they would consider going back to original horror and suspense like the classics. Too many talented screenplays and other stories out there to only repeat what has already been seen before. Here we go again. Somehow, prurient, graphic violence and sex are seen by way too many as juicy suspense, and I could honestly deal with only 45 minutes of this glossy mess. The little 'story' I noted was inane. Two foreign girls encounter a ghoul sewed up inside the mattress, and STAY in the hotel? I've been broke, but never that broke. Far worse, though, is the grotesque indulging in sadism. I seriously want to know: who believes that watching a man get anally raped by a ghoul (for quite a while, too) is good horror/suspense? Who admires an extended orgy scene culminating in bloody murder? I give 2 points only for LG's costumes. The rest of this twisted, unskilled, adolescent fetishist fantasy deserves absolutely nothing. This season i am not even bothering. Matt Bomber is completely lacking any talent. Gaga is Gaga, not an actress. But it really wouldn't matter who they cast. the show has just lost direction and jumped the shark. Last season Dandy was a reason to watch the show, and Twisty for the short time he had on screen. Even Jessica wasn't making an impact. I never liked Angela Bassett that much, and she was given far too much screen time. Its fallen so low by season seven, that thye need to try to use the election to bolster their ratings, meaning they didn't even have a clue until recently of where to go with their show. I'm not tuning in for a Hollywood crying about Trump winning. Half the country didn't find it all that horrible, and the open disrespect to the diverse political opinions of viewers is kind of unfortunate, but typical. There is no Horror in the third season. The storyline is simply stupid and has nothing new in it. <br/><br/>We have seen witches drinking the life out of people through the victims' mouths to prolong their lives or beauty or what-ever, in many movies and series before. We have seen black slaves captured and tortured by witches/demons/serial-killers in other movies and series before. Applying blood on the face with a powder-brush is not horror, it is just gross.<br/><br/>Jessica Lange and Frances Conroy play their characters in the same way in every season and it is getting annoying to watch them in the series anymore. Their characters are mean and cruel in the beginning of every season but later change into convenient, pathetic and pitiful towards the end.<br/><br/>First episode of the third season is the worst of all I've seen. A bitch witch who seems like she has got everything under control gets date raped by a bunch of college jocks, comes out of that drug induced delirium in a SNAP, but only after everything is over and kills them all by turning a running bus upside down.<br/><br/>OMG, the writes are in dire need of some brain. If you really want to watch something scary, this isn't for you.<br/><br/>It's a series of poorly strung together recycled horror plots. It wouldn't bother me how much they borrow if they had an original twist on the stories or actually made them scary.<br/><br/>They have some great actors, and some interesting characters, but the plot is all over the place. <br/><br/>I've watch all of Season 1 and the first half of Season 2. Season 1 had so much potential, but it really just fell apart in the second half and went no where with a half baked happy ending. Season 2, I started with hope of something better, but again so disappointing. I used to love AHS, but the last few seasons are bad. Im not into demons and devil worship. I'm very disappointed that's all this season is. I'm all for end of the world shows/ movies. I love the fight for survival and make you really think. But this is not it, it is just bad, the only part I like is season 6 it going back to the murder house and all the old characters, it really has the ahs feel to it. Then it went to devil worship and pulling a poor girls heart out her chest and eating it, and mumbling satanic words. I just cant with this show anymore. I think the writer is very disturbed evil person to come up with this. I am just cant feel good about it and giving up on AHS, I loved the first few seasons but it has run its course and it's just not even scarey, creative or interesting anymore, its just weird and evil,not scarey. I grew up watching horror movies I know it when I see it and this is not it. Hello,<br/><br/>I am a big fan of American Horror and I will not deny that. I have to say though that the beginning seasons were WAAAAY better. Why do each of the new seasons start out good, then take a stupid plot twist? One character will die off, but then they come back as new person??? They act like that character was never there and then they create them as a new person as if we won't notice? Come on.. there are plenty of actors out there to get at least a new person for that role. If you want to have that person die in the series then have them die! It's a scary show there will be deaths. We don't need that person to come back as someone new! You also will have that same person on the show and then have that same actor/actress as a diff person the same episode? I get it, but it's stupid. I like to see the same person season to season, but not the way you are doing it. Finally, don't introduce characters for an epic episode and then never show what happens to them. I'm not lacking your creativity on your plot, but on the way you carry it out. I will always be fan, but please work on this.... Having been a horror fanatic my entire adult life, I was excited to give 'American Horror Story' (AHS) a go, after it was recommended to me by my best friend. <br/><br/>Starting with season 1 'Murder House', I immediately became intrigued by the show. It's dark, sinister and has everything a true horror fan could ask for - the mystery, apprehension, magic, gore, wackiness - and a good cast of characters to support the story. I loved that the show wasn't afraid to push the boundaries and that it wasn't just another slasher show, which is what horror television mainly consists of. <br/><br/>In the beginning I was completely unaware that the show was an anthology series, so was incredibly confused when season 2 started in a different setting with a new story but the same cast playing different characters. However, I fully embraced it and fell in love with season 2 every bit as much as season 1. It was interesting to start with a completely fresh story and it made a change from the other shows I'd loved in the past which eventually turned to crap because they clung to the same stories and characters for too long. There was no risk of that happening with this show since each season was a new standalone story. <br/><br/>Season 2 'Asylum' took the craziness to new levels, but I loved that. There truly were no boundaries in what the show was willing to explore and I respected that since very few shows would do the same. <br/><br/>I can only assume the high ratings are from the first two seasons which are very strong and enjoyable, because after that the show took a very sudden jump off a cliff. I found it impossible to engage with any of the seasons that followed and found that the wackiness that had become the trademark of AHS was ALL they had left to fall back on. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, each time I have tried to get into a new season I've been unable to watch past a few episodes due to the wackiness overtaking everything else. In the first two seasons there seemed to be very solid and coherent stories that made sense, but afterwards I found myself scrambling to find any story at all. <br/><br/>I was hugely disappointed with the way the direction the show went since I thought it might be the first true horror show I could sink my teeth into and enjoy. <br/><br/>Overall, I would still recommend the first two seasons of AHS to anyone that was thinking of watching, but cut your losses after that because you're bound to be disappointed like I was. I loved the first season. Season two was the best one of them all so far. Season three was droll and predictable. Season four was good. I enjoyed the whole feel of the season and the characters were sinister.<br/><br/>Season five is missing the two major character draw cards - Jessica Lange and Emma Roberts.<br/><br/>All this season has going for it is the beautiful decor. The characters are weak. Lady Gaga can't act to save her life - she should stick to cheesy pop music.<br/><br/>I hope they do not decide to make another season. The writers seem to be bored with their creations and I find that I lose interest after about 10 minutes.<br/><br/>Why do I keep watching? I am waiting for the writers to prove me wrong and win me over again. I think I may have high hopes though. Big drop of quality in accordance to first season. This second started good with mysterious characters, pretty good atmosphere, suggestive plots, mental wanderings (of course) and a collection of horror movies topics caged in the typical psychiatric catholic hospital. There are all: Nazis with their experiments, half zombies, lesbians, aliens, nymphs, "le diable", catholic church, slashers, possessions. I'm all right with this, if they can make it work, credits for them. However, from the episode number four or five all start to decay. Plots become boring, main characters disappear, you don't care about some others ("mental handjobs" as we say here), softness start to reign and, this is the worst, where is the horror? Casting is good. Jessica Lange is very good with an attractive character; Sarah Paulson awesome; Zachary Quinto has the look for a disturbed person, easy for him; James Cromwell good as well; Lily Rabe the best in my opinion, great performance. The rest are worse than them. Can't forget, Chloe Sevigny appears too. Manufacture, as in the first, is top quality, one of the best ever seen, from the opening titles to the end. Spoiler: all the story about the blonde guy asshole and their women, Arden experiments (what happened, they could use them more), Ana Frank, really!?, soon death of sister Euniceand more, are thing I didn't like it and I think they affect negatively to the last result. Let's wait for the third part of American Horror Story, I hope they can get up. I will start off by stating I have liked American Horror Story. I thought the first season was the best with some very good seasons here and there and a couple which were just Ok. This last season (season 8 Apocalypse) was the worst season of any TV show that I watched (not exaggerating). The acting was horrible (Jessica Lange being the exception). The writing was lazy and predictable, and the directing was just as bad. I sat through it hoping it would get better, hoping there would be some sort of redemption, hoping there might be a moment that would make up for the crappy earlier episodes, but it never came. The acting was just horrendous. I know I said that already - but I can't convey how bad it was with just one line. Mutt and Jeff - are they serious. I thought I was having flashbacks from Dumb & Dumber. The sets were ridiculous, the costumes/makeup/hair were comical, and the acting was just unbelievably bad (I know). I will say it must have been tough for the actors to act with that writing - so I'm not totally blaming their acting skills - so to speak (but some acting parts, regardless of the writing, were just bad). That was a waste of time I can never get back. Crap and cringe script. saying things like " and just for the record, i like leather... not latex" ooohhhh and "it turns out that one of the twins are not mine", what?! Not scary at all. I never felt excited or spooked at any point during watching it. Just got bored. Was surprised to see it had many good reviews but I guess a lot of people like cheesy horrors. I love horrors but for me, this was a massive disappointment, overrated. <br/><br/>The acting is good on the most part, but I just find all the story lines silly. nothing scary about it - and thats coming from someone who gets scared pretty easily!<br/><br/>By all means watch it and see for yourself. My mum in law loves it and shes also a horror fan.. so maybe its just me lol. Best show, I love every season of it, I rewatched it 4 times and didn't get bored.<br/><br/>I rate it 10/10 because of the plot, storylines, acting and everything about it, its really deserve better and more high rating Each season is so unique even if they are connected.<br/><br/>I love how this shows enters in the depths of human mind and how it shows individuality in every character.<br/><br/>First I had no opinion on the 9 th season but for me it was weaker thant the previous seasons (exept Roanoke) but then I saw the finnale and i felt in love. This was the sadest thing that I have seen in a while.<br/><br/>This "The 80's will never die." from Montana and the last scene how Bobby is leaving his past behind.
It is creepy how we grow old and how we leave behind cultural moments each decade and it looks like that 80s and 90s were awesome and compared to "modern days".<br/><br/>I am a 90s kid and I saw each emotion in this season 9 final that I have in me when it comes to nostalgic for the time that past away and sliped from us without knowing.<br/><br/>I admire people like the producers of AHS for bringing us such moments in 2019 when people care more and more for things without any sence like social media etc. I have watched Five seasons in two weeks. Much to the annoyance of my husband! Although after sitting next to me watching S2 I could see him peering over his phone to watch. His words after the finale? "I can't believe I watched a whole season of something" this is binge worthy TV. The stories suck you in. The characters fantastic, the actors more so. Jessica Lange deserves particular credit for her many parts. She is just fabulous. So on I went to Season 5 and I'm ashamed to say I fast forwarded most of the 'dull' parts. The script was so predictable, I wasn't a fan of Lady gaga as the lead and I think this set the tone from the start.
Give it go. S2 is my particular favourite. The attention to detail is amazing. Particularly Eileen Wuornos. The characteristics were impeccable and I liked the added touch of her entrance music being her funeral song in real life. All in all I'm really pleased I stumbled on this little gem. Not thought provoking or entertaining, just another dumb horror show that isn't scary really drags on could be 30 mins. I would rather watch reruns of archer, legit, or Sons of Anarchy. I expect more from FX with the great shows they put out. <br/><br/>This show just falls flat waste of time just like paranormal activity series of movies. I think this show should be canceled how this show continues to go onand on and shows like Justified and Sons are ending make me sad. FX exec's need to do some serious thinking.<br/><br/>If you are a real horrow junkie and want a show that is actually scary, thought provoking and keeps you up at night you're pretty much out of luck as the dumbing down of TV and Movies have almost completely taking over in America. Penny Dreadful Is good and so is Salem try those out I'm sorry to see this series in such decline. We really enjoyed the first 6 seasons when the shows were more about horror. Season 7 & 8 are absolutely horrible. Skipping the rest of Season 8. I heard so much hype about this series being really creepy and quite scary. So i was excited, as i struggle with horror films and series as they're just plain boring and stupid.<br/><br/>This was a slightly more sophisticated 'horror' creepy thriller than most, but it is so boring! Nothing really happens. Its so slowly paced, and I feel as though i don't really care about any of the characters. It just dragged, episode after episode.<br/><br/>The question I found myself asking was: "who is the gimp?'<br/><br/>If you don't enjoy the first 2 episodes, I wouldn't bother watching the rest, it doesn't really pick up pace at any point, and is generally just quite boring. American Horror Story (or referenced as AHS) provides a good experience for anyone looking to enjoy a drama involved with a horror twist!
American Horror Story is now up to 10 different stories, some have been incredible and some have been VERY hard to get through. If you like a story that makes no sense, but has great acting, then enjoy this, what ever this is... I really really wanted to like it, but failed miserably. I think the first season is best and I really enjoyed the concept of Roanoke. Just think the show has failed to build on the success of the first season. Really was impressed with apocalypse for the first 3 episodes. I mean I thought it was the greatest thing since the first season and then it turned into coven season 2. Downhill from there. First season is a 10 star rating. Inbetween there and season 10 you lose a few stars. A shaky Season 1 ( understandable), a superb Season 2 , and an okay Season 3. After that, everything seemed the same/interchangeable. Shock value gone and for the life of me I cannot distinguish anything beyond the aforementioned Season 2. Very disappointed by this one. The first episode was quite sloppy. Since I usually don't judge a show based on the first episodes, I decided to give it a chance anyway. It's not everyday that we get to see a horror show after all. Things got better a few episodes later before turning into a slow and painful experience. I stuck it out till the last episode but I really feel like I wasted my time.<br/><br/>The editing is terrible. The characters are all very frustrating. It's like they deliberately choose to do the stupid thing. Despite all this, we get this ridiculous happy ending. This show reminded me of Lost when everybody started to think that it sucked (after season 1 basically). It's laughably poor. First 3seasons with Asylum being the best were rated as an 7,5 average.
After that it goes down.. the worst is Ahs 1984 which reminds nothing of American horror story. Its not horror. Its just splatter murders and that is it. Quality keeps deteriorating unfortunatelly... From the first episode, I was hooked. That is the problem. The first three episodes of the first season were so intriguing that I had to see how it played out. What followed was a wandering, incomplete, half-baked shotgun of ideas that are never properly developed. First seasons are sometimes like that, though. Unfortunately, the same formula has been utilized in every subsequent season. <br/><br/>Above, I wrote that you shouldn't knock the show until you've tried watching it. Well, I have watched every season of it, and it is extremely okay. Not terrible, not great, not even good honestly. It is simply sufficient as an option to pass the time if you are home sick with explosive diarrhea.<br/><br/>Good acting, though. I will say that. The best acting in the world, though, can't make a mediocre story great. SPOILER ALERTS CONTAINED:<br/><br/>I just finished binge watching American Horror Story season 2. I had heard it was the best and I've got to say I found it less interesting and less scary then season 1. Season 2 was way too disjunctured and tried to cover too many characters and sub stories at once, (i.e. 5 minutes of bloody face, 5 minutes of Sister Jude, 5 minutes of Dr Arden; 5 minutes of kit; 5 minutes of Sister Mary Eunice, etc. - if it wasn't jumping back and forth between story lines it was jumping back and forth between decades and sometimes decades & story lines at the same time). Many episodes were like 8, 5 minutes vignettes tacked together to form one episode in running time. So it got really tedious, confusing and boring and many times all 3 at once. Seems the writers equated sex perversion or the sexually disturbed with horror as most characters were one or the other and their sexual problems seemed to cause their problems. A lot of the so-called scares were just gross out violence. Many of the characters did not flush out over the season, i.e. the killer Santa (2 episodes only); the pin head missing for long intervals and an undeveloped storyline, the nymphomaniac (shallow and gone in a few episodes), etc.. Dr. Arden the former Nazi scientist in hiding - why did he kill himself? Because he loved the young blond nun that died? Was he just a disillusioned Nazi or a repressed pervert? Story very unclear. If so, then his self cremation act betrayed all his other vile actions. His character's motivations were not clear and did not ring true - so at best he was another wasted character. The mutants in the woods - totally wasted for scares and their story was way under developed. A lot of missed opportunities for interesting, deep horror themes were missed and I guess the worst part if you think about it was the the Lana Winter's character. We are to believe in the end that she went through her ordeal at the asylum because she was a monster too - a media monster that was willing to go through anything to get the story, so driven by ambition and her lesbian self awareness that she would keep and kill her own son (when he was an adult). The last frames of the season basically exclaimed she was the biggest monster of all - which I don't buy at all. Her character was the most developed and interesting. So in conclusion season 2 was not very scary, missed a lot of opportunities for strong story lines and rang hollow at the end. Many episodes were more soap opera than horror. Best single episode was #6 - the origin of Bloody Face. 3 out of 10 stars. DISAPPOINTING. Series needs better script writing and character development. Disturbing how America/Individuals are foaming at the mouth to see more and more insanely over top murder and violence for the sake of murder an violence. Pretend to be P.C. pretend to care about others , pretend its everyone else thats the problem. In reality all any of that has done is turn this AMAZING country into the most segregated place in the world , Shows like this belong in the garbage , but it wont.... because the majority love seeing this get more sadistic and more violent, Theres nothing original going on in this show , theres no amazing writing , actors leave much to be desired , and 85% of the show is blood soaked violence and swearing....If you subtract that from the show you wouldnt have anything expect a 5 minute trailer for each episode. So remember the more popular this gets , the more ppl embrace it. The more we allow our morals and standards to drown. Turn on the news or go out and ull quickly realize we cant afford to lose anymore ethics , morality or civility .... thats sad .... this isnt entertainment nore what anyone needs to see , wonder which route ppl will choose ............. sigh<br/><br/>P.S. Hollywood how about some original , quality and imaginative writing and ideas ! i know it hard when you can make billions with remakes and garbage like AHS ( which could of easily been a highly creative and solid show , but like always took the low hanging fruit , as u know thats all thats required these days... )Dont go holding yourself to a higher standard now ;) Just what American wanted to watch. No you are not getting another wonderful season like season 1 (if the first episode is any indicator). You are getting a show that will constantly tell you that you are a worthless human if you voted Trump. What a way to alienate half you audience. I don't understand why show runners have to spew their political opinions instead of making a great show. Hillary was not the second coming and Trump is not the devil. Please focus on the show and not politics. My advice, don't waste your time with this season, re- watch season 1 or find another show that won't preach. I have found it mind-boggling how interested everybody seems to be in this show here on IMDb, considering that it is actually nothing but badly acted mind-numbing garbage. Whatever potentials the show may have had earlier on they have been thoroughly wasted at this point. One of the most tiring things about the show is what a hard time it has on following up on a single thing that happens in it, as if the writers have no attention span whatsoever and no ability over any character development, as no matter how many ghosts or freaky things the family members witness in that house, the next episode they are just going on as if nothing has happened. Another tiring cliché in the show is scenes where you have people appearing in other people's houses uninvited -I just had to mention that, as it is fairly descriptive of how dumb the show is.<br/><br/>And still, everybody on IMDb remains positive towards the show and it ends up with an 8,5 rating. Now, I wrote a comment on a thread about the show the other day, but when I came back to check on the thread it didn't exist any more. Furthermore my wife gave the last episode a 1 star rating, but then later when she checked the average rating for women of her age (5 in total) was 10 -and yes, her details were correct in the settings of her account. I have started to believe that this page has to be rigged, that the makers of the show go on writing about it and starting threads, but then as soon as the threads turn negative they delete them.<br/><br/>Do not be fooled by the positive reception of this show on this page. It is horrendous. I gave it two stars as I have managed to follow it so far just to see how bad or more predictable it can get, and I suppose you have to get it a bit of credit for that. But the last show (which gets 10 stars on IMDb) was so dumb and annoying that I can't go on watching it any more. To me this show is just awful. It goes way far out of it's way to be disturbing, but to me isn't scary at all. There a huge difference between being appalled or disturbed and being scared. I was appalled! I could go on and on about the problems I found here. For one, I do not approve of the way they depict gays in this show. I have gay friends and I am embarrassed for them that any mass media show is depicting them the way they have here (it's almost like one of the execs thought he was going to increase how often he could turn people on with homosexuality but it really doesn't work that way). I also have to say, IF ghosts were able to become solid for undetermined, but extremely lengthy, amounts of time and in large amounts like they do in this show, ghosts would be a commonly known problem in this shows mythos (reality). Like some homes have roaches, some have termites, some have mice and some have ghosts. I don't think that was the producers intention though, but you can't have this much blatant in your face physical manifestation and not have the general populace be fully aware of the fact that hauntings and ghosts exist and that they are very problematic for the people living in a house with them. I really don't like having to suspend disbelief to this level when I watch a movie or TV. I love good horror, and it's really a shame I can't rate the seasons separately. They really are completely different in both content and quality. Season 1 was just excellent, not perfect, but very, very good. There was plenty of effort on the part of the writers to develop the characters and the twists and turns, though perhaps not entirely original, were well crafted nonetheless. The writing was skillful and the story quite creepy. I enjoyed it like a good Stephen King novel. Something dark to savor.<br/><br/>Season 2 is a complete mess, a train wreck of almost biblical proportions. It doesn't work at all. None of the characters evolve beyond depth of a comic book and the story is like something a sophomore in high school would write. It meanders from one barely explored character to the next. It has no build up, no tension to savor. It is a cheap imitation of the first season, which fails to deliver on almost every level. I wanted so much to like it, but finally gave up and stopped watching. Loved all the seasons prior to season seven. But season seven had no horror story, it was just full of political bashing. Completely disappointing since every other season was so great.. I have never written a review, so I apologize in advance, but I felt compelled to do so after I watched the pilot of this series because I don't want this one to end.<br/><br/>I have found it very difficult to find a movie let alone a TV series that it actually unnerving, but this is just that. <br/><br/>I can see the Nip Tuck influence in the nudity and shocking sexual scenes, but it only serves to make the story more interesting. This one is not for the kiddies.<br/><br/>This is now my favorite series. I hope you enjoy this one as much as I have. I had big expectations for American Horror Story. Following the early and unjust demise of Carnivale, and considering the quality of television drama these days, I was looking forward to another stab at a decent horror drama. After a couple of episodes of American Horror Story however, it becomes clear that this isn't it.<br/><br/>Anyone even remotely familiar with the genre will have to agree that the pilot alone went through just about every horror cliché – new owners moving into a large haunted house with a long history of violence, dysfunctional marriage, apparitions, disaffected teenagers, stories of demons, mystifying basement, unexplained shadowy charactersit's all there. Nothing new, then. Even Bernard Herrmann's Psycho score was shamefully plagiarised in one of the murder scenes in episode two. Jessica Lange must really be struggling to find work these days... I recently saw Seasons 1 & 2 of "American Horror Story" on Netflix. I saw it was praised and highly recommended. I saw the pilot episode and It hooked me, I thought I would be in for a complex, suspenseful & disturbing storyline. Unfortunately, I was disappointed around the third episode but I absolutely lost it around the episode, "Rubber Man". I finally saw the show for what it was, A overrated, pretentious bankrupting of ideas from various horror movies such as "Psycho, "The Shining" & "The Amityhouse Horror". This first season wasn't good, but was still watchable. It turned from cheap horror to B-movie comedy. The acting is atrocious most of the time. The writing is pathetic, cliché and over the top. I don't know what's worst, the boring characters dying in the most uncreative ways or the homosexuals in the show talking about getting & receiving penetration to a absurd degree, or the abysmal amount of sexual violence. I have a problem with rape if its done wrong in media and Here is the worst example to do rape in media. Now, all you need to know is there is a family and the husband had a affair on the wife. The wife becomes pregnant. How you ask? A teenager who killed 5-6 kids in a school shooting (that they have the balls to show, Not even Sons of Anarchy showed a school shooting) lives in the house as a entity (a ghost that is pretty much human) rapes the mother of the daughter (in a gimp suit) he's "twilight in love with" to bare a son for his mother. Three things I have a problem with: One, he didn't have to be wearing that suit. She still thought it was her husband not in the suit. Its supposed to be shocking but It's just stupid. Two, Its reveal is treated like if its so clever. But who didn't see it coming? I did. Three, they never explain anything about the house aside from "Bad things happened here". Sidenote: The other woman, Hayden, Kate Mara was the worst character. Yelling every five minutes, overacting as much as possible That's just whats wrong with Murder House. Asylum, is actually worse. They have a stupid religion context to torture homosexuals. Yeah I get it, It's old times but My problem is that Religious context becomes obsolete, soon it just becomes about a serial killer named Bloody Face (Yes, Really) who has mommy issues, and rapes the same lesbian main character that is tortured throughout by the nuns & doctors in charge of the Asylum. I hate this show. It's not clever its not funny. Its not scary. It's just a poor excuse to show sex & violence and make it seem Artsy and Complex but its just disgusting & the way they claim to represent homosexuals then exploit them is nasty. Im not a moral outrage guy but I really felt disgusted by this show. There is a way to make a real complex psychological, paranormal & psychosexual thriller that is actually scary. This isn't that unfortunately.<br/><br/>P.S, The school shooting is stupid. The shooter kills 3 kids so one of the other kids goes up to him and says like "hey man, stop". This kid hasn't shown any sign of remorse and started eliminating kids just because they are there so Instead of wrestling the gun from the shooter, tell him to stop & be surprised when he blows your f***** head off. I rather them die in a fight scene, woulda been more entertaining, smarter and save us from the dumb Swat scene, where they just unload on him cause He makes a gesture of killing himself and reaches for a gun. So 9-10 swat cops just unload on him, That makes total sense American horror story... this is a show about a family who moves into a haunted house.<br/><br/>Basically the show comprises of:<br/><br/><ul><li>Typical movie family... An adulterous husband. A wife that spends half the time crying. A rebellious daughter. And so forth.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Every cliché you can think of from horror movies... Resentful ghosts. Hands from under beds grabbing peoples legs. Mad doctors. Generic serial killers.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>A few taboo subjects such as abortion, sexual deviance (gimp suit) and a mistreated disabled girl to give the show... a little edge. But they throw those things in for no reason. You can tell that the only reason they put it in was because it would shock and offend just enough people, and get a gasp from their show. Abortion! Oh no they didn't! High school shooting! Oh no they didn't! Dead babies! Oh no they didn't!</li></ul><br/><br/>They throw this all together in a blender... and TA-DA. For a lot of people... mainly people such as the Glee audience (no offence, I think Glee is a great mediocre show) and say someone who likes Supernatural... for those people this show would suit them perfectly. "Kelly Stevenson posted OMG MY HAIR CURLER BROKE TODAY. WORST DAY EVER. ALSO IM WATCHING American HORROR STORY OMG DIS IS SOOOOO SCARYYY xx"<br/><br/>But if you have watched enough horror films or seen enough serious TV series, you can kind of tell this show lingers awkwardly in between mediocrity and the vain attempts to push the show into something more... unique. <br/><br/>Also... too many things happen for no reason. Why does the neighbour want to kill the daughter? NO ANSWER. Why do the house/the ghosts want to hurt the new family? NO ANSWER. Why did the serial killer kill these nurses? NO ANSWER.<br/><br/>Also some things are just answered simply because... it's supernatural! Why does the maid look like an old lady to the wife and a hot young woman to the husband? SUPERNATURAL Why is there (no one inparticular's) hand under the bed? SUPERNATURAL Why are the ghosts hanging around and some killing people? SUPERNATURAL Why did this person come back to life? SUPERATURAL<br/><br/>All that being said, there are some good points. The acting is not bad. Most, if not all the characters fit their roles (their roles being generic and done before). The creators did not cheap out with loud noise scares (jump scenes). They genuinely try to creep out the viewer. Key word there is TRY. The show is entertaining. You throw it on when you have nothing else to watch and it will pass the time. Take the show too seriously and you are an idiot.<br/><br/>MAKING LOVE TO A DEAD NUN. See what I did there? I put something "SHOCKING" into my review... so it must be a new and different style of review! SUCH INNOVATION! (You get my point.) This show is full of all sorts of messed up...They might say that these shows are supposed to be scary, but this wasn't even scary at all at first, but after 9 episodes in I know well enough that this just ain't right. This stuff isn't just creepy it's dog on wrong: adultery, depression, evil spirits, terrorism, money, all mixed up with a bunch of ignorant house owners (obviously) that I just can't stand to watch anymore. This show was such a drag, get to the point! And did I mention that this just ain't right? This is certainly not for the simple soul just trying to watch a good scary show, and if you have a hard time at all in anything, especially mentally, this frankly is just, in my opinion, not the show for you. But all this being said, for the purpose of why the show was created it dog on did creep me out, it did not necessarily scare me though. But just for the sake of some closure and conclusion would be the only reason I would finish the season I started. The first season was barely just watchable. After that, they were just garbage. Incoherent stories that lead nowhere. And a very forced storyline to get a musician into the series somehow? I'm fine with cameo appearances, but don't get lazy about the script / story! It's like they threw the season's manuscript together in five minutes. I kept watching episode after episode, hoping that something interesting would happen. And of course, it didn't. That's my fault for continuing to watch even though it was pretty clear that there would be no satisfying end or any interesting development.My bad.<br/><br/>I suppose Jessica Lang was kind of born to play her roles in the series. Pretty fitting roles. Aside from her, the cast is kind of mixed in terms of their performances. some are acceptable, some area bit cringe-worthy. Oh wells, at least it's not as bad as Jessica Jones / Luke Cage. Avoid wasting time watching the show at all costs!!! <br/><br/>Remember how you hated yourself for sticking around after "Heroes" season 2, "Lost" , "The River", etc. etc. after episode 1 season 1 !!!<br/><br/>The plot line(s) were one of those making-it-up as long as the show is not been pulled .... Or it could be that the writing team is simply BAD.<br/><br/>I guess the assembly of great actors prevented the show from being canceled. The ever great Jessica Lange made lemonade out of this lemon role and won an Emmy in 2012. But she should be careful. She may be type cast in the psychopaths roles for the rest of her career like many other big name female stars in their later screen years. I've zoned in and out of AHS over the various seasons (usually zoning out before the finales), but the premise of Apocalypse seemed promising and so I stuck with it 'til the end, for good and ill. As my title decries, it all starts out well - the nuclear attack is well staged and the episodes that focus on the Outpost and Michael deliver, but when the witches show up, the setup is all undone and the narrative becomes increasingly fragmented and, sadly, rather tedious (with many of the initial characters suddenly forgotten about). At one level, this is due to the unsubtle feminist/gender politics that pervades the latter part of the series, but it is also because there is ultimately no tension or suspense as, given that the world is literally in ashes, it will obviously all have to be rectified if there are to be any further AHS instalments. Hence, the outcome of the Coven's mission is never in doubt and, thanks to Mary Sue Mallory, Michael's Reign of Hell is obviously doomed, with his defeat pretty much being the lazy result of a Harry Potter/Terminator 2 mashup (with some Alien and 2001 thrown in for good measure). For me, Michael is the star of the series (and Cody Fern is great), and while the Omenisms are knowingly obvious, it is a shame that more was not done with this as his ending is pretty banal given the build-up, to the extent that it almost feels as if an episode or two is missing (I did like the return of Anton LaVey, though). And while some may find it gratifying that previous AHS instalments are alluded to and developed, it does become a little confusing at times when the same actors keep appearing in episodes as different characters. However, Joan Collins is magnificent, so for all of the shortcomings of Apocalypse, that definitely is a compensatory factor. The first few seasons of AHS were absolutely thrilling (mainly seasons 1 and 2). The characters were believable, the story was grounded and realistic, it was mysterious, enticing, bizarre and genuinely creepy unlike later seasons. Then came season 3. Despite Season 3 being substantially better than seasons 5, 6 and 7, Season 3 was (at least for me) where everything started going downhill. (season 4 was actually pretty enjoyable despite being a bit messy) I won't go into any details about the last few seasons because I honestly wouldn't know where to start, but I think it's quite obvious that the show has been gradually losing steam, which really is a shame because there was a lot of potential. Seasons one and two of this show were really good, with the following seasons ranging somewhere between ok and really bad. However, season 7 was awful. I feel as if season 7 was trying to troll viewers on both sides of the political spectrum, but I could be wrong. Either way, it was extremely boring at times. As a long time AHS fan ( albeit less and less as time goes by) i was still looking forward to season 6, if anything the add campaign gave an image of it being quite interesting.<br/><br/>But i'm now two episodes in and frankly quite bored. <br/><br/>It's the whole interview thing, it slows down everything and takes every last bit of suspense out of the show. And it does that because you know it's all acted, those kinda video interviews work for documentaries or when the real victims/ criminals are talking but not in an acted format.<br/><br/>There are no scares either, so far it's all just rather tedious plot development. Which i would normally applaud but in a show like this you expect another kind of content.<br/><br/>The acting also feels off somehow, like no one is comfortable in their role. The talent is there so it must be the script..<br/><br/>All in all i give it a 4/10 so far At first, I really liked this show. It's stylish and some of the settings and themes (Asylum, Freak Show) were interesting to me. There is also good acting and some um, attractive talent. All these things held my interest for awhile, until the story line in each season started to drag, going nowhere- especially in Freak Show. In Freak Show they killed someone in like, every episode and it seemed like an uninspired way to change the plot or offer thrills. Some of the deaths were just ridiculous! Also, Gaboury Sidibe is a terrible actress. <br/><br/>Now in 'Hotel' they're trotting out Lady Gaga, who registers no emotion and who's character has no depth or complexity at all- she just looks cool. To me, her presence indicates that the whole series is becoming more about style than substance.<br/><br/>Then yesterday I started watching Bates Motel and suddenly realized what a good horror show looks like. Now I'm feeling even more critical of the plot progression and character development in American Horror Story- which is stylish and visually impressive but also aimless and dull, sometimes ridiculous. They paint liberals as victims and conservatives as demented. I used to love this show but one episode into season 7 eliminated many of their fans, including me. I didn't like Trump at first either but as someone who is pro-life, I had to vote against Hillary.This show makes others like me seem insensitive, demented, and many other things I won't name here. I'm extremely disappointed and wish I had not wasted my time binge watching this series. They can spin it however they like, but the reality is they insulted every conservative. Having watched the pilot episode, I can't seem to figure out what to make of this show. I guess the phrase "too much too soon" would be the best way to describe what I think of it right now.<br/><br/>First of all, I'd rather they didn't make the family so dysfunctional and the characters so troubled. The way things are, that family would probably self-destruct even if they lived in a suburban doll-house.<br/><br/>Second of all, there seems to be little balance between normal and weird in the show. I found myself being literally bombarded with spookiness. And I wouldn't want to quote a certain black comedian mocking white people and their reluctance to leave a haunted house, but seriously... How many grim warnings one needs to get the message? If something outlandish happens every other minute, and every single person you meet is either a psycho or a weirdo, you'd be wise to consider leaving the vicinity of the house asap.<br/><br/>But, all in all, the thing that really bothers me at this point is the seeming lack of subtlety in this show. I'd say, it would be a lot scarier if the family had to deal with reasonably rare and almost intangible signs of strange presence in their new house than a whole barrage of unsettling incidents and ominous remarks from nosy neighbors and creepy strangers.<br/><br/>I'll be watching the show anyway (mainly, because I like the cast). And I'd really like to see where it's going. Hopefully, it doesn't turn into a one-episode-one-monster-to-beat kind of show. I started watching this show, probably like a lot of people, after reading some rave reviews and hearing a lot of good word of mouth. The first few cheesy minutes of the series should have been a sign, but my curiosity pulled me in. With tired "scares" and endlessly unbelievable characters reminiscent of a made-for-TV Stephen King script, this show is, as the title of this review suggests, merely a soap opera with some ghosts thrown in. <br/><br/>Like any soap opera, much of the writing crosses the line from suspension of disbelief to "Well that's convenient," all the way to "Give me a ****ing break." Without spoiling anything, I will simply say that the writers make themselves visible too often, and by that I mean, rather than being a show about real characters dealing with horror and grief, the show becomes about what ridiculous attempt at a "twist" the writers can dream up next for our two-dimensional, unlikeable cast. <br/><br/>Worst of all, none of it is particularly believable. The characters continuously play against what might be called common-sense, or even human nature, and the show spins evermore into the territory of the ridiculous. It stops being fun as the show continues to compound the notion that these characters are merely plot devices for a plot that isn't terribly interesting.<br/><br/>And none of this even broaches the subject of how such a haunted house could contain such boring ghosts. The only reason to watch this show is to figure out the "logic" behind this ghost-house: Who are these ghosts? Why are they trapped here? Yet the novelty wears off as soon as you realize you could replace the ghosts in the basement with ex lovers at the door and you'd just as soon have a typical daytime soap opera.<br/><br/>So if you're a soap opera fan, or a fan of such series as Nip/Tuck, you might enjoy this convoluted quest down a tired and hackneyed rabbit hole. But if you're looking for genuine scares, genuine moments with genuine characters, or even relatively interesting story-telling, you'd be better off looking elsewhere.<br/><br/>Don't be tempted by what little intrigue there is in the first few episodes. The mystery wears itself out long before the halfway mark. ...The first couple of episodes were interesting and creepy but after that it's progressively gotten worse. It's not scary, which was supposed to be the whole idea, right? Jessica Lange is so over the top she's unwatchable and nauseating.<br/><br/>I guess we're supposed to watch because of the laughable violence. A plot without a hundred ghosts running around would be nice. So Ryan Murphy is supposed to be one of the "IT" guys in Hollywood? LMAO! What a mess of a program. I stuck through this execrable first season. I won't for the second season.<br/><br/>Supposedly Murphy has said there will be a new family next season? That's a surprise? The inherent problem with horror TV shows is that they just don't work unless they are a weekly anthology series. You can't keep going for the same old schlock and shocks without boring the viewers who've seen it all before. Got to come up with something besides slitting the same old throats, ya know. My Facebook Status: American Horror Story, here is what I find troublesome. Mind you, I don't care much for any of the characters (I somewhat care for the teen daughter, Violet). I find the Down Syndrome element VERY troublesome because the children of Constance Langdon are: a murderer, Tate; a "deformed" chained-in-the-attic Beau; and a child with Down Syndrome, Addie. What is up with that? A child with Down Syndrome is born to a mother who produces only "abominations"? I am living proof of otherwise. Then, the old photos of children with Down Syndrome in the opening credits as examples of creepiness is truly cheap and disdainful. k, via Facebook, I have accepted that though I love the supernatural, ghostly stuff, zombies, the ethereal, the creepy/scary, I am DONE with a show that exploits those with Down Syndrome. I am thrilled that an actress with Down Syndrome, Jamie Brewer (what a charmer!), has work, I just think it should be more conscionable work and THAT is probably up to her parents/guardians. These seasons have become too political...makes me less of a fan every time. Shows like these are an escape from one sided politics. Season 7 has been VERY disappointing. The horror is totally gone and the season just seems to focus on shock value using current social issues with an extremely liberal bias. I enjoyed seasons 1 - 6 and have been struggling more and more with each episode until I've reached the point that I'm now totally disinterested. It's a total shame the writers and producers can't seem to focus on entertaining without injecting politics. This would be a good show if not for a lack of discipline in the scripts. I don't mind all the fashionable political incorrectness. I don't mind that it's not realistic. I don't mind that it's horror movie clichés reaching and not quite arriving at a camp sensibility. A story has to have a set of rules in the universe it creates or there can be no payoff, no rewards. There are no rules here. The writers have created a situation where they can do whatever they please and anything goes. Problem is that we don't care then. I have to say, I love Jessica Lange and only watch now for her deliciously campy and brilliantly delivered personification of evil in a blonde beehive. She's a Beverly Hills Blanche DuBois, a slut with a heart of stone. The others in of the cast don't seem to understand that the only way this stylized piece works is a camp, cult classic. If only John Waters could take it over and bring Divine back from the dead, we'd have a hit on our hands. As it stands now, all it's got going for it is good production design and Jessica Lange. I don't know what people expect from nine seasons this was a terrific job and growing up in the 80s made it even better as far as I'm concerned they earned themselves a chance to keep going until otherwise .looking forward to season 10. This used to be a great show, but now is a soap that's not as scary as Joan Collin's shoulder pads.<br/><br/>All the seasons up to last season were great, but cult and apocalypse are awful. I'm sure Sacha Barajas cohen based his who is America character off cults reaction to trump. Yes it's slightly tongue in cheek but not for a whole season. It could've ended half way through.<br/><br/>Then we come to apocalypse which is more apocalypse wow! Than apocalypse now. Michael Langdon is so wet as the anti christ you'd think they took him from the new Sabrina series. And they even got Chloe's husband from 24 miscast as a satanist. I just imagine him saying "come on love join the dark side".<br/><br/>The problem is they think Evan Peters is the star and he's not. He pretty much plays the same style again and again as does Sarah Paulson. It badly Mrs the queen of the show Jessica Lange and the amazing Angela Bassett.<br/><br/>And no I don't lady gaga back. She was a monster for all the wrong reasons. Ok first of all I am a director student so I pay double attention on specific details.<br/><br/>Each season is beautifully unique and executed in its own way which make the show overall unique. <br/><br/>The cinematography. The directing. The story in each season is banging. <br/><br/>The camera movement is god damn good in each season. 
The acting.. Oh god, Jessica Lange is such a good actress.. Yea i know she put jessica lange in each part but its her signature and its amazing. Her acting is simply breathtaking. 
Sarah paulson is very good also. Emma roberta is fun. Kathy bates is awesome as usual. The rest of the cast is also good.<br/><br/>Overall the show is really good. My favourite one was COVEN. And the least one is freakshow. When it first came out, I wasn't interested in American Horror Story. However, so many of my friends recommended watching it that I finally got around to watching the first season. I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't total garbage, but I was also a little frustrated by the end of the first season.<br/><br/>American Horror Story, as many of the negative reviews have already said, falls victim to incorporating too many of the ideas of movies and books that already exist. It doesn't have very many of its own ideas, so it doesn't feel fresh or unique. Some ideas were new and interesting, but fell flat because of how they were done. Another problem I had with the series was that so many of the scenes were simply not necessary, and felt more like fluff than actual content. They didn't add anything to the story or develop the characters. Finally, the characters were not very likable or interesting, and there were far too many of them in comparison to the number of episodes, so it was difficult to get close to any of them. The episodes that dealt mostly with the Harmon family were very boring, more like a soap opera than a horror series. When I think of a horror series, I imagine something that at least has jump- scares, but nope. Not a single part of the first season was scary (or even really surprising).<br/><br/>Some reviewers complained about sex and violence in the series. It is a horror series, so you should expect violence. As for the sex, it was over-the-top, but SOME sex scenes did add to the story and were necessary to advance the plot. If you don't want to see sex on TV, don't watch the show (or any other show with an MA rating). Also, some people complained about the misogynistic and generally discriminatory themes in this series. The racism of the characters doesn't necessarily reflect the ideas of the writers, and usually coincides with the setting. It's realistic. As for people complaining about the misogyny because "all the men in the show are bad." Most of the people in the show are bad in general, not just the men. There are many male characters that had good qualities, especially in the first season.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I felt that the series really had potential but didn't make the best use of it. Perhaps the next seasons will be better. I am sick and tired of Hollywood trying to incorporate political messages in Movies & Television Shows. It's bad enough that we are inundated with political garbage on every so called news station, but now we are forced to watch it in American Horror Story! I was a big fan of this series until last season when it became somewhat boring. I was hoping for a nice comeback in Season 7, but episode one was a major disappointment. Here is my advice to Hollywood: GET OVER YOUR POLITICS ALREADY! NOBODY SHOULD GIVE A CRAP ANYMORE THAT HILLARY LOST AND TRUMP WON. WARNING: THIS IS CHOCK-FULL OF SPOILERS!!! I'm referring specifically to the 2nd (Asylum) and 4th (Freak Show) seasons. While I made myself finish the 2nd season I had to stop mid-way through the 4th because it was intolerable. Jessica Lange's character Elsa was ridiculously campy, the directing was atrocious, the plot looked like it had been written as a 4th grade class assignment and, except for the actual freaks, the acting was laughable. So a rich boy who is a serial-killer in the making just happens to run across a serial-killing clown who for no reason explained doesn't kill him and they cooperate together, even though said clown never says a word? So you've got 2 con artists who travel from the east to Florida to kill freaks to sell their remains to someone who won't ask questions? So you have an apparent hermaphrodite with 3 boobs and a 'ding-a-ling' (their term, not mine) who turns out to be all woman when she has a miscarriage? So a fat Michael Chiklis is supposed to be a strong man? And Elsa and the 2-headed twins both are fooled into believing they'll have their own TV shows??? WHO WRITES THIS GARBAGE??? Back to the 2nd season - it was painful to watch but Jessica had a much better character and James Cromwell was fun to watch, but the plot once again was insane with stupidity. Cromwell's an ex-SS Nazi doctor who was notorious for performing experiments and continues on at the asylum, creating what we think are mutants from prisoners and yet this is never actually explained. There are other idiocies with the plot but the most insane of all involved alien visitation of THREE people, two of who were at the asylum and one of which was suspected to be a serial killer. When I saw that, I knew the writers were morons, as it is a complete non-sequitur for the asylum theme as no one was put there because of their stories about the aliens. It isn't worth explaining how that subplot worked itself out but it was dumb. The fact that the 2 hacks writing this nonsense worked the devil, aliens and Nazis into the plot confirms THEY need to be institutionalized! Where all these positive reviews for this series are coming from, I have no idea.<br/><br/>Please listen to me on this one, if you love actual horror - this ain't it. This is chock full of plot holes, overacting, horrible directing, gratuitous torture and murder scenes that aren't even that well done and good actors trapped in impossible roles. I loved the first 2 seasons of ahs but coven is awful. I hate the story line and everyone coming back to life is just dumb I was like YES!! When the red head died /: then she comes back to life it makes me sick, I hate this ahs !!! I want to stop watching and I was hanging on the past seasons episodes I waited to see the most poorly written season ever booo ahs . I'm finished watching and haven't finished the season even maybe next season will be better, if I even watch it anymore blah ahs the dumbest season ever . They better go a completely different direction with the next season. This may make some people happy but only the dull and ignorant. i guess my biggest problem with this series is it's classification as horror. it seems more fitting to call this a violent mystery/soap-opera to me. no amount of somber piano or screachy violin will convince me this is horror. i anticipated something a bit different when i saw reviews stating this is "for true horror fans". and if you watch this under that expectation as i did you may be disappointed by how slowly this develops, or how borrowed it's conventions are. what will keep you watching, if anything is the many subplots that are conveyed bit by bit over the course of the series. while these are interesting, they didn't feel like enough to justify my time spent. any attempt at actual horror comes off incredibly cliché. maybe this was intentional as a tribute to classic horror movies, maybe not. either way it all feels incredibly predictable and familiar. if you're into Gothic TV dramas, this is an attractive show with slick editing. however if you're looking for true horror i'd pass this over. it can be a real bore, unless you've watched a haunted house movie and wished it was several hours longer, featured illogical characters and the constant nagging of a handful of hackneyed ghost character types. I have never watched this series before but it seemed to be compartmentalized into new stories each season, so i jumped in at season six. <br/><br/>What amazed me, is the fact this nonsense has made it as far as six seasons! Contrived to death, formulaic as hell, replete with lame premises and often puerile, shallow characterizations. <br/><br/>In a word, BAD. I'm astounded anyone could endure 40 minutes of this, let alone a season or more. <br/><br/>In my opinion, yet another "conveyor belt" series for the masses. Two out of ten from me. Outstanding season!! Awesome cast, fantastic twists each episode! Loved the ending, made me cry! Nothing wrong with a happy ending with your horror. The 80s will live forever!! Loved every minute of it! Lots of twists, but the vast majority of them feel slapped onto the end of the story for no other reason but to stretch it out. After the halfway point of the season, you're not compelled to keep watching; you're just dragged through each additional episode that oh-so-conveniently came out of nowhere.
Dialogue is unnatural and most characters feel like cardboard, just like bad 80's horror movies. I don't give it bonus points for following the theme it chose. It's just gore candy that tastes ok at best. This was another show my ex's always pointed out worth watching. Being an avid horror myself, I have to say I really couldn't stand this show. The first season wasn't bad but ends on a rather dull note but the writing steadily grew worse with each season.<br/><br/>The interesting thing about this show is that each season would focus on different characters lives but would be played by the same actors. Unfortunately the roles these actors generally play are horribly typecast and don't really evolve from the roles they are given. You can pretty much look at the actor and figure out what type of character they will play within the first 10 mins of a new season.<br/><br/>The writing and narrative in this show is really immature and its the biggest turn off for me. While each season tends to focus on different horror themes like haunted houses, asylums, witches etc... the creators tend to cram as many horror trope into each episode as possible with characters not really getting any room to breathe. They are shuttled from one horror scene to the next without any glimpse of a normal life and generally feel comically cliche and overdone. Apparently the protagonists in the show have to have the worst possible things happen to them at all time.<br/><br/>This show also has quite a few seasons but sadly the writing and characterizations don't evolve. Often enough it feels like writers are engaged in their own personal war where often enough some established horror is brushed aside as a non factor in the next. It seems like if someone comes up with a situation to set up the next episode, its resolved in a very nonclimactic fashion and has no further relevance to the reset of the scene.<br/><br/>If you are looking for something that manages to have a good balance of intrigue and horror, this show isn't it. There aren't many recommendations to make but Haunting of Hill House is a pretty decent horror that doesn't keep slapping every trope in the horror book in a single episode. Unfortunately TV shows are more interested in equal representation of nationality rather than creating some compelling narrative. Less a stand-alone narrative than a sequel to Murder House, Hotel, and especially Coven, American Horror Story: Apocalypse makes explicit what fans have implicitly known since Pepper (<a href="/name/nm1303594/">Naomi Grossman</a>) was committed to Briarcliff towards the end of Freak Show - each season takes place in a shared universe (as well as being a sequel to the three aforementioned seasons, Apocalypse also features oblique references to Asylum, Freak Show, and Roanoke). In recent years, the show has unquestionably stumbled, first with the poorly constructed meta-narrative of Roanoke and then with the horrendous Cult, leaving a fanbase yearning for a return to the brilliance of Murder House and Asylum. Apocalypse is nowhere near as good as those glory days, but it's a damn sight better than the last two seasons.<br/><br/>When a nuclear conflagration wipes out most of mankind, a group of survivors find refuge in Outpost 3, one of multiple fallout shelters constructed by an organisation known as The Cooperative. The Outpost, tickets for which cost $100m per person, is run by disciplinarian Wilhemina Venable (<a href="/name/nm0005299/">Sarah Paulson</a>), and her stern right-hand woman Miriam Mead (<a href="/name/nm0000870/">Kathy Bates</a>). It's also home to obnoxious "Instagram influencer" Coco St. Pierre Vanderbilt (<a href="/name/nm0343678/">Leslie Grossman</a>), her put-upon assistant Mallory (<a href="/name/nm6609666/">Billie Lourd</a>), her camp hairstylist Gallant (<a href="/name/nm1404239/">Evan Peters</a>), his socialite grandmother Evie (<a href="/name/nm0001058/">Joan Collins</a>), talk show host Dinah Stevens (<a href="/name/nm0692013/">Adina Porter</a>), and Timothy Campbell (<a href="/name/nm6563873/">Kyle Allen</a>) and Emily (<a href="/name/nm6737315/">Ash Santos</a>); two teenagers assigned a free place because of their "exceptional genetic makeup". There are two main rules in Outpost 3; no one goes outside without permission and full protective clothing, and there is no sex, on penalty of death. However, after eighteen months cooped up inside, with only "vitamin-fused gelatinous cubes" to eat and a single song playing on repeat on the radio, the inhabitants are on the edge of madness. Enter Michael Langdon (<a href="/name/nm3719144/">Cody Fern</a>). A representative of The Cooperative, his presence concerns Venerable and Mead, as it emerges the strict rules of Outpost 3 are of their own devising, and have nothing to do with The Cooperative's edicts. Langdon reveals that many of the Outposts in the US have been overrun by scavengers, and so The Cooperative wants to populate an un-impenetrable shelter called The Sanctuary. Langdon is to interview the Outpost 3 residents, including Venable and Mead, to determine who will be taken to The Sanctuary, pointing out he may take "some, all, or none". Langdon, of course, is the murderous baby from the end of Murder House, and only Cordelia Goode (Sarah Paulson again) and her coven of witches can stand against him.<br/><br/>I would imagine that if you haven't seen Murder House, Coven, and Hotel, the events of Apocalypse would be difficult to follow. In any case, as a cross-over season, there are a number of returning characters. Aside from Langdon and Cordelia, there's the Harmons, Vivienne (<a href="/name/nm0110168/">Connie Britton</a>), Ben (<a href="/name/nm0001518/">Dylan McDermott</a>), and Violet (<a href="/name/nm3920288/">Taissa Farmiga</a>); the Langdons, Constance (<a href="/name/nm0001448/">Jessica Lange</a>), Tate (Even Peters), and Beauregard (<a href="/name/nm4567370/">Sam Kinsey</a>); Moria O'Sullivan (<a href="/name/nm0175814/">Frances Conroy</a>); Billie Dean Howard (Sarah Paulson); Elizabeth Short (<a href="/name/nm0002546/">Mena Suvari</a>); Zoe Benson (Taissa Farmiga); Myrtle Snow (Frances Conroy); Misty Day (<a href="/name/nm1143816/">Lily Rabe</a>); Madison Montgomery (<a href="/name/nm0731075/">Emma Roberts</a>); Queenie (<a href="/name/nm2829737/">Gabourey Sidibe</a>); Nan (<a href="/name/nm4661932/">Jamie Brewer</a>); <a href="/name/nm0630088/">Stevie Nicks</a> (playing herself); Marie Laveau (<a href="/name/nm0000291/">Angela Bassett</a>); Delphine LaLaurie (Kathy Bates); Papa Legba (<a href="/name/nm0714698/">Lance Reddick</a>); and, James Patrick March (Evan Peters).<br/><br/>Many of the previous seasons of American Horror Story have begun strong only to fall off towards the end. This was especially true of Asylum, whose final three episodes may as well have been from a different show. Apocalypse's pilot, "<a href="/title/tt6417466/">The End (2018)</a>", is arguably the best first episode since Asylum, and although the eighth and ninth episodes ("<a href="/title/tt8241376/">Sojourn (2018)</a>" and "<a href="/title/tt8241374/">Fire and Reign (2018)</a>") are weak, the final episode, "<a href="/title/tt7639488/">Apocalypse Then (2018)</a>", provides a reasonably satisfying conclusion (albeit relying on something of a Deus Ex Machina).<br/><br/>Perhaps the most noticeable thing about Apocalypse is the structure, with the majority of the content taking place prior to the Apocalypse itself. About ten minutes into the fourth episode, "<a href="/title/tt8241368/">Could It Be... Satan? (2018)</a>", the show cuts to three years earlier, telling the story of how Langdon went from being a baby in 2011 to a man in his 20s in 2021, how he came to be involved with The Cooperative, and how he came into conflict with Cordelia and the witches. The "present" is then not picked up about mid-way through the finale. It's an interesting structure that allows the audience to ask certain questions they wouldn't in a linear narrative ("why is such and such a character not at Outpost 3?") at the expense of some dramatic tension (we know the witches' efforts to prevent the Apocalypse, which comprise much of the season's meat, are doomed to fail).<br/><br/>As with every previous season of the show, the acting is exemplary. This season sees Paulson pulling triple duty as Venable, Cordelia, and Billie Dean Howard, whilst also directing the sixth episode - "<a href="/title/tt8241372/">Return to Murder House (2018)</a>". Evan Peters does her one better, however, playing four characters; Gallant, Tate, James Patrick March, and Jeff Pfister (a new character introduced in "Sojourn"). And to nobody's surprise, Jessica Lange is superb as Constance, despite having only two scenes. However, the stand-out performance is Cody Fern. He is especially good in the scenes which show him still living with Constance, where he plays Langdon as a confused and moody teenager, a performance diametrically opposed to his 2021 Langdon, who is poised, confident, and quietly dangerous. Even after he learns who he truly is, the subtlety of Fern's performance elicits unexpected empathy for a character who is irredeemable. His playing of the exasperation Langdon feels with everyone expecting him to know what he is doing, and his concomitant confusion, is especially noteworthy.<br/><br/>As one would expect, mood is paramount, with the first episode doing a fine job of establishing the tone of the season. From the outside, Outpost 3 looks like a Richard Serra sculpture, whilst inside, <a href="/name/nm1650634/">Val Wilt</a>'s production design is all dark Gothic corridors lit by firelight, complemented magnificently by <a href="/name/nm0103368/">Paula Bradley</a> and <a href="/name/nm0264248/">Lou Eyrich</a>'s gorgeous costume design. There are also twists and turns galore, with the first major plot twist coming at the end of the second episode, "<a href="/title/tt8241360/">The Morning After (2018)</a>". Additionally, the camp humour of previous seasons can be found throughout - from Evie complaining there's no stewardess on their plane and reminiscing about how disappointing <a href="/name/nm0000989/">Yul Brynner</a> was in bed, to a Satanist minister (<a href="/name/nm0000928/">Sandra Bernhard</a>) proudly telling her congregation she stole money from a nursing home and gave it to the NRA, to an absolutely pitch-perfect reference to <a href="/title/tt0082377/">The Final Conflict (1981)</a>.<br/><br/>Thematically, the show has always been hit and miss. On one hand, Murder House told a story about a middle-class family turning on itself, Asylum was a parable about clinical repression and religious cruelty, Coven dealt with loyalty and the conflict between tradition and modernity, and Freak Show was a plea for acceptance and tolerance. On the other hand, Hotel, Roanoke and Cult were thematically weak. Reading between the lines of Apocalypse, it's partly about how centuries of male leadership has led the world to the brink of destruction, something which can only be avoided by the intervention of a group of women. Indeed, one of the major plot strands sees a group of warlocks teaching Langdon how to harness his magical abilities in the hopes he may become the first male Supreme. Although Myrtle reminds them that "men are simply not equal when it comes to magical ability", as testosterone is an inhibitor, the warlocks are so determined to overthrow the matriarchy that most of them ignore the signs that Langdon is dangerous. In this milieu, the dynamic between the witches and the warlocks is an inverse of traditional gender roles, with men forced to justify their behaviour to women in positions of power.<br/><br/>However, there are problems. For one, there's those two episodes that precede the finale. A hyperbolic depiction of Silicon Valley bro-culture, the characters of Mutt Nutter (<a href="/name/nm2813994/">Billy Eichner</a>) and Jeff Pfister are a one-punchline joke stretched over two and a bit episodes. Elsewhere, "The End" features a scene where Timothy speaks in voice over, suggesting he is to be the focal character. However, not only is this not the case, but he never speaks in voice over again, making this scene stand out like a sore thumb. "Fire and Reign" also features a truly random and poorly thought-out diversion to Russia in 1918, depicting the murder of the Romanov family. The scene serves very little purpose, and feels like the writers were throwing darts at an atlas of historical mysteries. The Satanists are also ridiculous, so camp and clichéd they didn't even work as parodies. Additionally, the way the story resolves itself is a little too easy, whilst some viewers will object to the conclusion insofar as what it means for the ghostly inhabitants of Murder House.<br/><br/>All in all though, I enjoyed Apocalypse. The cross-over is well handled, even if the timeline is confusing (how could Hotel have ended in 2022 when the Apocalypse takes place in 2019 - something not addressed until the final episode), and the fact that so many actors are playing more than one character (occasionally in the same episode), really lets you see just how talented a group of performers they are. Better than Freak Show, Roanoke, and Cult, it's probably on a par with Hotel, but is nowhere near as good as Murder House, Asylum, or Coven. The first season was good, the third good, the fourth good, everything in between and after, literal utter crap, with the last season being the glaring wet bowel fluids to top this mound. I really did not think it was possible for the latest season to be any worse season 6, boy was I wrong. I get it that Ryan Murphy is the average liberal SJW but the fact that FX would allow him to project his mass triggering like this is unacceptable. The entire "Cult" season is nothing but 11 hrs of one giant Marxist psychological projecting train wreck. This season will be remembered in history as if only to show future generations what it was like for a network to allow someone to produce a show throwing a temper- tantrum over election results.<br/><br/>I've seen where defenders are claiming that Ryan Murphy makes fun of both sides, therefore it's OK, let me clear that up right now, no he does not. He makes fun of the independent voters who voted for Jill Stein thus not allowing his anointed queen Hillary Clinton to win the election. He then proceeds to essentially paint every one of Trump's supporters into a maniacal cult who use fear( like Trump ) to get their way. That might be OK entertainment if it wasn't so blatantly real and delusional as to which side of the political spectrum utilizes fear mongering, but Ryan Murphy is known for projecting the tactics used by the MSM and democrat party onto the right. I used to laugh when I heard the phrase "Trump derangement syndrome" because for one I thought it was an utterly ridiculous thing to say, but "Cult" has very much proved it to be a real thing.<br/><br/>Where you stand on politics is irrelevant. I put away my politics to try and find some enjoyment in the show, but frankly it was impossible once I realized I was watching a grown man's temper-tantrum masquerading as a television show. Take away the triggered snowflake elements of Cult and you are simply left with one persons very delusional sense of reality that can't even manage to write it all that well. Cult, and previous seasons, are such a discombobulated mess it makes you wonder if the episodes were being written as they were being filmed. It also seems as if Murphy( taking inspiration from the better show 'Blood Drive' ) wanted to push the limits of dropping 'F' bombs on TV as far as he could. It's literally like watching a mentally challenged kid with a new toy for as much as he had character dropping the word in every episode, so much to the point that I thought at least one episode's entire dialogue would be. The characters are flat and unbelievable, which to the actors defense considering what they had to work with it's not all that surprising. Season 1, awesome. Next 2 seasons were ok, if I remember correctly. Ever since it just gets worse and worse. Except for hotel, which I must say was pretty good, especially lady Gaga, who although I don't care for her she was great in this role, but the last 2 seasons were atrocious, especially cult. Just god awful bad, I really hope they cancel the series because my wife makes me watch this drivel with her, and she even admits it sucks but it's a nostalgia thing I guess. The accents, the cast, the characters its all so boring. This is by far the worst season. The story is so uninspired. Wes Bentley makes me want to fall asleep every time he speaks. Nothing is really working for me - its not scary - its not suspenseful - half the time my mind is just wondering away. Lady Gaga pretty much just does the same scene's over and over nothing ever really happens. Matt Bomer also boring. Cheyenne Jackson boring. The only characters that I had some interest in where Denis O'Hare and Kathy Bates but even they have me snoozing. I'm not even going to mention the blond kids.... Lets wrap this up.<br/><br/>I'm giving it a 5 out of 10 and that's being generous. The first season was great and the second one amazing. Then it just went boring and I stopped watching. Sorry guys, I wish that I could rate it a 10 just for the first two seasons but that's not fair. So a five seems legit.<br/><br/>The first season is the haunted house and the second is about the asylum. Which is easily my favorite! I guess someone might like the other seasons as well if you're into the teenage which crap. But I'm not so.. Then the freakshow... Meh, kinda ridiculous if you ask me.<br/><br/>I had really high hopes for this series but I ended up being disappointed.. This show started out well but then it became a train wreck.To start every Character is over the top,completely.Some characters just appeared out of nowhere(the maid)..Within the first 10 minuets you ask OK everything here is crazy why do they stay...just leave the house...Why stay.Its hard to understand characters who can simply walk out of the situation.There is a total lack of common sense Every scene pushes the envelope,its too much,it needs to be toned down.The show is easily confusing, hard to follow,Its all over the place..<br/><br/>Why keep the crazy blond kid around?Why keep the maid?Why live there? none of it makes sense... Season 1: "Murder House" had its ups and downs, but was overall fairly easy to follow, at least by comparison to the next seasons. It had a few great episodes, a few boring/confusing and lousy ones, but was OK overall. <br/><br/>Season 2: "Asylum" was a mess cramming in too many unlikable characters with too many, distracting go nowhere subplots and became a monster mash, only with occasional awful musical numbers thrown in. The entire writing staff should have been fired and replaced by competent ones who understand that likable characters and a straightforward narrative structure equal a better, more focused show and happier viewers. <br/><br/>As Season 2 progressed, I began growing more and more bored, confused, and angry at how stupid the show kept getting. Aliens, Nazis, mutants, demons, and maniacs all in one place? That's retarded and just way too much. Every new episode was torture, but I kept hoping it would get better. It didn't. I didn't even bother watching the last two episodes for ten months, that's how much I didn't care what happened, and only bothered to finish them because Season 3 was coming and I wanted to be caught up even though I know the seasons aren't connected story-wise. <br/><br/>Season 3: "Coven" began last night, and after watching the premiere, I have to say it is just more self- indulgent tripe from the same morons behind Season 2, only now we have ZERO likable, interesting characters. The witchcraft is not authentic, the special powers are stupid, and as much as I like Jessica Lange (she was great with Jack Nicholson in "The Postman Always Rings Twice"), I never want to see her dancing around again after Season 2. Everyone is hamming it up unbearably, especially Frances Conroy, who is just awful in her one scene and looks ridiculous. It's like the show is trying to appeal to older viewers with all these "Whatever Happened To Baby Jane" old ladies trying to make a career comeback AND to the idiot YA "Twilight" crowd who want to see teen girls doing dumb teen stuff. Seriously, who is the target demographic for this show now? It's not horror fans. So is it targeting "Murder She Wrote" old people? Middle-aged soccer mom Lifetime network viewers? The "Twilight" teen crowd? It's all over the place!<br/><br/>There's way too much estrogen going on this season, not enough female eye candy, and too much male-bashing. I just hope Kathy Bates doesn't get naked like in that creepy "Family Guy" hot tub sketch.<br/><br/>I almost didn't make it through the first episode of Season 3, and have no intention of wasting my time on this series ever again. And the preview of episode 2 begs the question, do we really need witches, zombies, AND Frankenstein? Why do all the same actors have to be crammed into each season even if they don't belong? It's like they're just writing roles to squeeze them in regardless of whether it advances the plot or not. Stupid, lazy writing.<br/><br/>The entire writing staff should be fired and the show runners/creators removed (yes, that means you, Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk for signing off on this brain-dead garbage), but I'd go one better if I were an FX executive and cancel the series. It's creatively bankrupt and has nothing new to say. It's not scary, not funny, it's nothing but junk that isn't doing the horror genre any favors. Honestly, it's like whoever's writing this isn't a horror fan and just wants to make it into a soap opera for weirdos, but without any of the charm of the original "Dark Shadows" TV series from the 1960s (not the crappy '90s reboot or the Johnny Depp/Tim Burton cinematic abortion). It started off so promising but it quickly degrades itself into feminist tripe. Sadly as is the case with 95% of movies and TV series these days it favours feminism and male bashing over telling a good story or having any decent characters. Another show that I won't be watching any longer. Another dopey episode that asks you to suspend disbelief but you can't because there are way too many holes in the story writing. <br/><br/>It's too bad. The concept is interesting but the writing really sucks.<br/><br/>This episode sort of follows up the Halloween episode where we learned that Tate was a killer. <br/><br/>It shows the killing. And it's dumb. <br/><br/>Example: one kid confronts him as he's shooting the students. Tate's backed is turned to him and the kid has a good 7 seconds to jump him. <br/><br/>But does he? No he calls him, waits for him to turn around and then...bang.<br/><br/>Just bad writing.<br/><br/>And what's so special about that basement that all the spooky things are down there and why on earth isn't there a light down there? This show is a cliché show of any known horror movies. Bad scenario, bad acting, bad plot. I watched the pilot and after 1 minute I knew this will be a pretty bad show. So I decided to watch the first 5 episodes.<br/><br/>Man what a waste of time! Really how come we allow writers to write crap like that<br/><br/>Nothing stand up, poor writing The reviews rate of this show is shocking. How come people expectations are so low?<br/><br/>This show is for teens.<br/><br/>This show is insulting human intelligence<br/><br/>jm Using the same actor for 4 different roles in one season is really cheap and boring already. The first season was good, the third good, the fourth good, everything in between and after, literal utter crap, with the last season being the glaring wet bowel fluids to top this mound. I really did not think it was possible for the latest season to be any worse season 6, boy was I wrong. I get it that Ryan Murphy is the average liberal SJW but the fact that FX would allow him to project his mass triggering like this is unacceptable. The entire "Cult" season is nothing but 11 hrs of one giant Marxist psychological projecting train wreck.

The characters are flat and unbelievable, which to the actors defense considering what they had to work with it's not all that surprising.<br/><br/>As I said, season 1, 3, and 4 were good, so there is some evidence that Murphy can write good ideas, either that or he's a concept man throwing a bone to an army of amateur writers and taking all the credit. But Cult was just garbage. I see people/fans wanting to know what the next season( the fact that this show was renewed after season 6 is mind blowing uncanny, but I digress ) will be about; well seeing as Donald Trump is going to be president for the next three years it shouldn't be to hard to figure out because people like Ryan Murphy are not known to stop their temper-tantrums anytime soon. Cult served as nothing more than an outlet for a grown man's rage. We watch movies and shows to escape from reality and yes some always have elements of reality in them but Cult is an insult to the average viewer that literally looks to insult half of the country while serving as fodder for the other half.<br/><br/>AHS has become something of uniqueness because it's the only show where the teaser trailers are better. While many will try to pretend it's a more complex take on horror in order to make themselves feel smarter for their appreciation I find it to be an insult to all the horror movies and shows( for which Murphy is unapologetic for ripping off elements ) that came before it and defined the genre. The first four seasons as well as season six of AHS were in my opinion the best (of course every season still better or worse compared to each other). They were able to capture the essence of the show through their story. The atmosphere was never so much scary as it was depraved, something that felt even more horrific than the occasional jump-scare. The dynamic of every season was pretty much the same, the episodes start off by giving you a handful of clues at a time so that when we shift into the second part of the season everything somehow comes together to create one huge disturbing mess that leaves you at the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>Yet season 5 seemed to fail at this dynamic, starting off with hints and drawing the bigger picture only to make the big reveal confusing and leaving the viewer with more questions than answers. <br/><br/>But the biggest disappointment I have seen so far is season 7, which also brings me to the reason why I am writing this review in the first place, since you can't review a season separately (only episodes) I have decided I will just do it like this. In AHS Cult all familiar<br/><br/>structure that has been used previously on the show goes straight out the window. There is absolutely no built up to anything, if there was maybe it was just not interesting enough for me to notice, and the big reveal is, well, non-existent. To make matters worse the theme is just idiotic, a failed attempt to show us we need no angry vampires and vicious witches to feel afraid, all we need is politics. I mean really? How cliché can you get. Every episode exists of someone from the cult being tied up to a chair and beaten up or stabbed to death in the least interesting or scary way possible. You feel absolutely no sympathy for any of the characters and don't care if they die at all. And all of this seems to have no purpose. When I think of people following a cult leader who is mentally unstable and homicidal I don't feel creeped out, I feel irritated that there are actually morons that stupid out there, and that's basically how season 7 makes you feel. I would advice you if there is any part of the series you want to skip to make it this one because it is pretty much a waste of time.<br/><br/>Hopefully season 8 will make up for the mess! Based on slasher early 80 movies.
better then the 3 previous season.
take it for what it represent.
I wonder if they pay lots for music rights.
cheers. I do like horror i do like fiction but this is disappointing. I gave this show a try, in fact 6 ones,I watched 6 episodes. <br/><br/>I have to say its a crappy show because the human interactions they are trying to depict are dead wrong,awkward,fake. I cant really point out the facts that make it seem so "fake" but it is..Besides some reactions to certain situations (2-3) all the other ones are so off.They tried to create a messed up family with dark secrets but all the human interactions feel wrong.And at this point i feel i became repetitive.<br/><br/>I cant continue watching this and i wouldn't recommend it to no one in a good mental health. I tried this after "The Walking Dead", which was another fail. I want all horror series to work for me, it's my favorite genre besides fantasy, but...<br/><br/>The biggest flaw: it's just not scary. Not for "real" horror fans, people have different taste but i just dare saying this stuff is more for kids than anything else. In a real horror experience you sometimes forget you are looking at a screen, that doesn't happen at all here. It's too fake, it's not presented in a believable way and you just shake your head too often.<br/><br/>Part of that feeling comes from all the plot holes, ghosts in this show are not acting like ghosts. When they are killed (and return), they act like humans (i guess it's so we can get all the pointless drama too..). They ally with their killers, instead of urging for revenge. They care about soap opera feelings. There are no boundaries here, it's only scary if it follows some rules, right? Random crap always reminds you it's just a silly show.<br/><br/>So yea the story, it's a complete mess. The introduction of the main chars, the house and other basics - fine. You are lured into believing this could be something. But soon enough it's all over the place, you lose track of what you should remember and i stopped thinking after a while (and started wondering why am i watching this).<br/><br/>The characters are annoying. They are either over the board "kiss my ass - life sucks" style. Or dominant women (who are crying inside of course, we neeed the drama from them as well). Or soft cakes. Or just freaks, but not the likable kind. And the actors are all washed up, really i liked nobody here.<br/><br/>And i also thought the production (camera work etc.) sucked. Those easily impressed call it "it's not taking itself serious". I call it cheap material. Avoid. I can't believe this has such a high rating. I can only assume people rushed to review this near the start of the first season.<br/><br/>And it did start very well. It's never actually scary, more of a soap opera for ghosts, but there were some good performances, especially from Lange.<br/><br/>The biggest problem I have with this, is that it's one of those American TV shows, that they seem to write it episode to episode, without having a cue where they're taking it - like Lost. And it ends up a confused mess, like those one sentence at a time stories you used to see on internet forums where everyone chips in a sentence.<br/><br/>I only managed two thirds of season two before I had to stop watching. I often get roped into bad shows and feel like I have to watch them out of duty, but this was too bad.<br/><br/>They have so much talent on display, presumably they also have a large budget. Couldn't they do any better than this? Because the seasons are unrelated, I may yet try the new story when season three premieres. Hopefully they'll improve the writing. Season 2 is better, especially if you're looking for entertainment. Mad house with run by psychos. They got monsters, mutants, ghosts, lesbians, serial killers, horny nuns, devils, you name it, they got it.<br/><br/>Lovely hipster fonts, hipster art direction, even the serial killer Bloody Face is a hipster. A bit Gothic, a bit retro, everyone's a hypocrite, everyone's twisted, a lot of drama. There's Chloe Sevigny, Franka Potente... I bet a lot of graphic designers would enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>Entertaining.<br/><br/>I'm glad I decided to watch this, I almost didn't, learning from the season 1.<br/><br/>For season 1, it's totally awful. The dad is too hunk to be a father, and too stupid & ignorant. If he's a shrink, why he doesn't even realize his teenage daughter's angst, and even, didn't realize that the daughter has been dead for weeks. Yeah, the daughter just decided to stop to go to school and never got out of the room - and no one cares, her parents are busy with their own intimacy issue. The dad must be the worst shrink ever.<br/><br/>Bad storyline. And even the ghosts are pathetic, the whole series I can't help but feel sorry for them. Not entertaining at all. The ending is tacky too.<br/><br/>Awful. American Horror Story makes much more sense when you consider its creators also made Glee. Yes, the two shows are polar opposites in terms of subject matter, but they both carry a central quality of fascination with pre-adulthood that defines the show yet falls short of supporting its ambitions.<br/><br/>The high point of the show for me is the relationship between Tate and Violet, which progresses with the season to become something palpably dangerous. The overblown histrionics of the other characters' sub-plots manage to fade when these two are on screen, and even if the core idea of forbidden teen love is somewhat overdone in the horror genre these days, the writers treat Violet with a rare and understated respect that is all too absent otherwise.<br/><br/>At the same time, there are a lot of distractions in this sideshow-style production, and while some are successful (most notably the maid, who never fails to give me a shiver), most are not. I leave the show feeling that I've had one too many dishes with my meal and all undercooked: If the creators had dropped about a third of the less interesting plot lines, I think they could have polished what remained and created a show that really stood out.<br/><br/>As is, however, American Horror Story is just too obviously too much.<br/><br/>EDIT: I'm going to have to revise my rating after watching the end of the first season. That was just... awful. I fast forwarded through the episode with closed-captioning on, only because I was curious why the show wasn't over yet. There were parts throughout the season that I enjoyed, so I'm not downrating it all the way, but I wish I hadn't wasted my time with the last three episodes. This show gave me almost the same feelings as the first 'Paranormal Activity' movie did.<br/><br/>Perhaps I have an overactive imagination--perhaps I read too much Stephen King. Whatever it is, this show feeds that and I didn't sleep well after watching it. I know I will program it into my DVR and watch it the day after it views.<br/><br/>I am very happy with the casting; Jessica Lange is particularly delightful. I hope they don't blow it in future shows and wimp out on what they are doing.<br/><br/>I think you should give it a try. If it's not your type of 'thing', there are plenty more shows out there to watch. This season made no sense.. the plot was all over the place. The only saving grace for this season was Evan peters. Didn't really like how they teased twisty the clown the first episode and then never see him again?? I really hope that next season isn't as bizarre as this one was. This is easily the worst season by far. The Plot. Both physical and psychological horrors affect a decomposing family, workers and residents of a hotel in this anthology series, focusing on the theme of addiction.<br/><br/>Absolutely hands down awful.<br/><br/>First let's discus all you really need to know -- Lady Gaga -- she cannot act herself out of a paper bag and is and way beyond her means in this main role. Then there's her looks. She is supposed to be a siren but she's bug ugly. And I mean BUG UGLY. She's over weight, pudgy and overly unappealing. She looks like the side of a house in a dress. And her face resembles Marilyn Manson.<br/><br/>It's fearsome to view. She brings the already bad show down. Then there's the plot -- or should I say lack thereof. Don't expect anything to make sense.<br/><br/>The only good thing is the hotel itself which was supposedly built on the lot for the show. It looks cool. That's where it ends. <br/><br/>This is truly a horror story...only not the way they wanted. Avoid at all costs. Saw it. Piece of garbage. Everything the far left wants you to be programmed with. Funny how the starting scene, you have two lesbians with their family in a family setting and you have a Trump supporter in a basement all by himself watching the election. That is the "left reality". The "real reality" would have been a mother and father with their family watching the election. The guy in the basement is actually a liberal basement dweller. That's fact. This movie makes Trump supporters look like deranged killers and stupid rednecks (the trump supporter guy in the grocery store). But if you notice the "Trump Supporter" basement dweller, he acts just like the left controlled Lemmings do. Dark Clothes (ANTIFA), man buns (conservatives don't wear man buns). Trump Supporter guy in the basement dry humping his TV over Trunp's victory (that's how liberals act). Trump Supporter Guy throwing a urine filled condom at illegals (ANTIFA throwing urine at police). They did get one thing right though. They showed how weak-minded and pathetic liberals are. One of the best shows ever made! good plot, storylines and great acting with a very good cast, but I don't understand why this got a 8/10, it's deserve better ): Best tv show ever. best cast and very well done acting and writing, how this is 8.10? its deserve at lest 8.6 After season 1, which I liked, I kinda took the rest of the seasons with a grain of salt. But here we are in season 9, which I'm finally watching, and here is Emma Roberts and John Carroll Lynch, gotta love it. And the throw back to 1980's slasher films. I have to say they're doing a good job of it. Then turns to utter crap. The writing is horrible. I should give it 10 stars for being so horrible. Imagine a horror movie with a good plot told in about 12 or 13 segments. You would imagine that there would be an over arching plot that captivated the audience, it would reel you in and left you breathless until the story climaxed at a grand finale that blew your mind...<br/><br/>...this is not that kind of show.<br/><br/>I felt as though this was a mini series that wasn't a mini series. From season one, you see the story laid out before you and it started to draw you in more and more, but then once they had your attention, the story started to drift in different directions trying so desperately to keep you entertained that it became less of a masterpiece and more of a parody.<br/><br/>I have been binge watching this series and I'm finishing season 5, aptly named 'Hotel'. The story telling doesn't change throughout so far. With every season it seems as though they start with a great idea and a great plot, but then they needlessly pollute the storyline with these minor tangents that they thought would somehow enhance the story but ends up just reducing the overall impact of the main storyline.<br/><br/>It's like saying 'my cousin got shot in the leg twice....<br/><br/>.....and got shot in the torso fifty times.'<br/><br/>Those two gunshot wounds in the leg seem minor after that.<br/><br/>That's AHS.<br/><br/>You take the plot to 10 of your favorite horror movies and turn it into a 13 episode mini series and you get a season of underdeveloped characters trying their best to tie up under developed story lines.<br/><br/>The only way to make it worse is to throw in a little Lady Gaga and they somehow managed to do that too.<br/><br/>With every season, the first few episodes show such great promise that it's hard to deny that there could have been something great here, but with every season the writers draw my attention away from the main story line so heavily that I find myself wishing the season would end so I can move on.<br/><br/>I'm sure many people would find this show entertaining since it holds all of the symptoms of a good suspenseful horror movie of quality, and I'm happy for you if you found something you enjoy watching, but it seems it's just not for me. I give 5 stars to the series because it started well. But I can not keep watching it because I no longer feel any excitement that is expected from a horror movie. I got to 7 episodes in 1 season but just realized it was not my series did not inspire me enough to keep watching it. I gave him a chance but ... Thats not for me Action : yes
Entertainment : yes
Acting : average (sometimes below)
Story : too sci fi for an AHS season. Lacks the intelligence and elegance of previous early seasons.
Characters : shallow, lack the depth and development they had in (forex) Freakshow. Unlikeable for most of them.
Cordelia is supposed to be a compassionate, kind and fair supreme. Since when Is she a bigot ? But okay.
Sjw agendas : plenty
One last thing: I think that, at some point of the writing, Murphy must have missed the point of what "anthology" means. This is my fav genre. Loved the first season!! Next few kept me interested. Last were reaching but heard all was going to be wrapped up so was sucked in. I kept watching but friends gave up. Wish I had followed their lead. However was encouraged with the last season. Caught my attention like first season. Actors are so amazing which makes me keep watching. So disappointed with ending. I have watched the series right from the beginning. I endured Taissa Farmiga's constant "a hipster deer caught in the head lights of a car"-expression, I endured the 3rd season "Coven" which was boring, but on the other hand I have enjoyed Jessica Lange's and especially Evan Peters' and Sarah Paulson's acting and seen some awesome horror and gore. But.. when Lady Gaga came in to the picture, I was terrified that the show would turn into a Gaga feature video, so I didn't continue with the series. I gathered strength and waited until I was ready. And about a month ago I entered the Hotel. That was a mistake, as I predicted. the Hotel is even worse than Coven was, ten times over. Gaga just sucks the energy out of every scene and I'm guessing that's because she is actually Lady Gaga in every scene instead of being the character she is supposed to be. I wouldn't be surprised if some episode started with a Gaga dancing and spreading her crotch to the camera. Until the Hotel, I would've given 8 or even 9/10, but now.. I'm being generous and give it a 6. OK, mostly I don't review TV shows that still didn't finished, but because the way the AHS is I think it's safe to do. I will do for season:<br/><br/>The House: It's a good season, with a very good horror scenes and a lot mystery. But the season really has a down fall in the last episodes, becoming more a comedy than a horror, I also didn't like the ending. (7/10)<br/><br/>The Asylum: I really didn't like this season. It's a mix with a lot stories (A boy was abducted by aliens, a girl need save her girlfriend for a serial killer, someone is possessed by a demon, etc), that looks like the writer didn't know what to write in the season. Also it has a lot filler episodes and plots (I truly don't know what was the purpose of the character of Frances Conroy is). (3/10)<br/><br/>The Coven: It was a enjoyable. The plot was linear and interesting and the cast was likable. It has a really some dark moments and very light moments in other, but despite of everything I think the story could be made a little better, with more horror elements. (6/10)<br/><br/>The Freak Show: It was a great season. The cast was great and the plot was very good. My only issue with that season was "Where's the horror?". Seriously, the most 'horror' was the serial killer clown, but mostly of the season was the drama of the freaks. The season was more a 'American Drama Story'. (6/10)<br/><br/>My Vote: 7+3+6+6=5.5=5 I found their political jokes & stereotypes of liberals & republicans to be disappointing & inappropriate. This season was all about the writers political opinions & stereotypical jokes. I loved all other seasons because they had likeable characters & interesting horror stories but this last season was NOTHING Like their prior seasons. The storyline was boring, & the constant political jokes were distasteful. I was sad to see another show dividing people political, I'm not even republican but the way they demonstrated republicans to be evil people was very upsetting & untrue, most of my LGBTQ friends are conservative & when we watched this show they were deeply upset at how these writers viewed them as people. Never going to watch another season of this show, wish they never went political . Each season has gotten worse. This cult season is just boring and has absolutely nothing compelling to watch. Time to put this dying dog down. It is really hard to rate this show. I enjoyed the first two seasons the most. Seasons 3-5 were enjoyable but not as good as the first two seasons. But specially after season 5 it went downhill very quickly. It was not about horror anymore but about politics and feminism. Big dissapointment! The first few episodes really lure one into the drama and horror that the story presents.One definitely appreciates it as a change to the normal comedy and detective-type TV series' of which so many are out there.Once you watch the first episode,you'd surely want to see what happens next.But going through the whole season can really bore you,The story moves from its original path of horror but induces a more dramatic,dull and depressing scenario that seriously takes away the attention of the viewer and after watching the latter episodes one would want to cry out like hell due to the dullness of the series.And you'd want it to be over as quickly as possible. To sum up,if u'r a fan of physco/drama TV-shows looking for something new,you'd absolutely love it.If not,then don't bother wasting time on it! Could ghosts be so physical? Father a child? you're kidding me. Going with the plot, you can easily doubt everyone around you is not an human. Logic has its place even in a ghost story. That makes the last episode sound like prolonged and... comical. I think the production team has been aware of it and dropped the intention of making a sequel. Ghost stories have long been easy-to-get by hard-to-get-right stuff, and that's why "Shining" by Jack Nicolson is so classical. No other films originated from Stephen King could approach the bar it sets. Its believable anyone would compare AHS to it. Stop trying to make the ghosts' world a replicate of the human's. To a lover of ghost film, they're just not the same. i can imagine the dialog between the producer and the screenwriter: "here's a bunch of papers, just s%^t on them. No need even for a word processor - use a pen or even your $##$%, they really buy everything today." Screenwriter (under the influence of drugs or alcohol): "huh?" Producer: "Don't worry, we have great actors- Jessica Lang, no less! - and CGI and an excellent HD photographer and we'll have twisted sex there! It goes great with blood, you saw that already!" Screenwriter: "How ...much will you pay?" Producer looks at him, disguised "Just...just write mother*&^*^ and and you'll get... money...Just make sure there's blood here " <br/><br/>Well... and there were TWO creators... OMG, that was a strange experience, watching it, and seeing rating of 8.2 for this piece of crap makes me want to leave this planet! It's just a bunch of random, absurd episodes ... god... Stop the world, i want to leave now please! the worst horror show on television, i terribly feel pity for the directors of this show because they are living in America and having every best facilities in the world and still making a crap like this. full mark to the actors but on contrary zero for directors. not even average story.made it in very childish way, no sequence even child can make this kind of crap i really feel pity for the directors<br/><br/>no words for the first part it was terribly bad. i hardly watched this and now i came to know that i wasted my all time to watch this freak show. watched all parts of this freak show and i couldn't feel even goosebumps on my body now waiting for the 4th part and hoping this time they do it better else i am going to waste another 10 hours of my life We have enough Left wing liars in the media pushing their politics on us, stay out of it and focus on making a good show.<br/><br/>You treat us all like idiots who need to have your moral nonsense shoved down our throats in order to prevent wrongthink.<br/><br/>Go away and get back into the hole you came from.<br/><br/>1-Star and will never watch this show ever again. I'm a bit disappointed with this show. I was really eager to watch it but it didn't take long until I understood that it wasn't that scary.<br/><br/>The horror tricks are very clichéd and it's more "freaky" than scary. The caracthers are kind of boring and the actors could be doing a better job.<br/><br/>I think that for a horror movie/show to be scary it MUST be at least a bit believable. The viewer must think "this is possible" or "this could happen right here". But the truth is that the story takes a really unbelievable route. There is too much exaggeration and they really cut a lot of the suspense by revealing too much too soon.<br/><br/>I really can't understand how this show can have more than 1 season simply because nobody would be that stupid to stay in that house so long. <br/><br/>With all said, it has its moments and you should at least give it a try because it might be your kind of show. And I think there is some possible room for improvement and the show can still take some good turns within the next episodes.<br/><br/>PS: This show has absolutely nothing to do with kind of style of Paranormal Activity or Saw as some reviewers posted before. It's more within the lines of "Amtyviile Horror" and "A Haunting in Connecticut". I actually only watched first 4 episodes of season 1 and then I abandoned it. It's boring, predictable, characters are unstable, childish, petty and extremely unlikable. It's not scary at all, not intriguing.
Now guess I can't judge the whole series based on a first season with despicable characters, but I kind of didn't want to bother watching the next seasons after detesting this one. I know characters, places and stories are different in each season but I'll pass. I just finished watching Season 6 aka "My Roanoke Nightmare", which is an apt title. It was, indeed, a nightmare. Horrible dialog, bad acting, and a story line that's all over the place. The writers must have taken multiple plots and because they couldn't decide on which one to use, decided to use them all. A little 'Blair Witch Project', 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre', parodies of true crime programs and talk shows...all wrapped up in a B horror movie.<br/><br/>I was a huge fan of the first 5 seasons and had expectations of another great season but was hugely disappointed. Apparently the (lack-luster) AHS wiz-kids have decided to become our voice of political guidance counselor instead of our mid-week delicious fright-night bartender. SO? Where's my "'safe space" to forget about this crappy episode? Hopefully, all things being equal, as they do, I'll at least get a winner's trophy for "participating". <br/><br/>Well, in S.7 CULT, the beer is FLAT and the dialogue is contrived and monotonous. Sarah Paulson is at her most insipid, annoying wasteling. If groups truly want to march on something outrageous, clownish and bigoted, it should be lesbians in Hollywood against the leading couple (sorry, I wasn't interested enough to even recall their character names). <br/><br/>The irony here is, like liberal dems themselves, during the last 10 years, no one working on show could take a step back and say, "Man, maybe we've veered of the tracks in the past couple years and should go back to doing what works, what's creative and fundamentally, what we, the voters, oh oops, viewers honestly want".<br/><br/>Well, I am moving on! I will not watch AHS ever again. . . might even sell off my box sets of S.1 through .6 on eBay (stay posted). <br/><br/>I guess it's true what they say about TV series, usually after the fifth season, the creators tend to lose their spark +/or think their godS +/or feel the need to change their SOP and "teach us, just what we REALLY need to know about our world". No thanks! <br/><br/>Well, at least my DVR can use those 10 hours on something new. Maybe I'll download American Gods. Now that was really something this year! Take a look if you haven't seen it. Kudos to Jessica Lange, Kathy Bates, Angela Bassett, Lily Rabe, Frances Conroy and Denis O'Hare for not being involved in this season. Wouldn't you like to see the fantastic, sexy beast, Ian McShane, beloved Mc'Swearegen, make out with Fiona Goode? (Yeah I know I brought 'Deadwood' into the fold). <br/><br/>Reviewer 'NotMyaDaughterA" summed it up best. Yes! They "jumped the friggin' shark" in S.7 : ep.1, all while wearing a pig mask! BE WARNED: Director B.Buecker, Writers R.Murphy, B.Falchuk, Editors T.Kubrak, J.Greena are all hell-bent on committing a most atrocious case of "wussification" on us, their once loyal, fans. 1st season was OK, the 2nd was a little bit better, then came the 3rd more amusing then scary... then the 4th season excellent - the 5th was boring and now the 6th season = totally BAD! Overall I would like to give American Horror story 5 stars.<br/><br/>1st = 5 Stars, 2nd = 6 Stars, 3rd = 5 Stars, 4th = 8 Stars, 5th = 4 Stars & 6th = 1 Star<br/><br/>Come on people, they must come up with something better than this! Tired of seeing the same actors running around screaming and trying to act! Especially that Sarah Paulson, damn she is the worst actress on the show just after Jessica Lange.<br/><br/>I was really enjoying a horror series, but truthfully - this is the last season if they don't do any better next time! Not ten minutes in, and I can see there's a problem. Plot holes. Huge plot holes. The thing that makes a great horror film is when it's something that could actually happen, you can see yourself in the role of a character. I can forgive a slight misjudgment, but I have trouble with inconsistencies. They rely on creepy sound effects and a lots of shadows. This is great if you're oh, 9 years old. But any older, and you're brain is constantly going to remind you that this is fiction, and you won't be able to forget it and get immersed into the story, and get a good scare. It's like trying to tickle yourself. Sorry. I gave a 4 for the sets and a 1 for the script. Good: season 1-6 (with 1 being the best, diminishing from there)
Bad: season 7 (worst thing I have ever seen in my life)<br/><br/>I've been a fan of AHS since season 1, intrigued by the story-lines, entertaining plots, and interesting characters. I like how they use many of the same actors/actresses over the seasons. Loyal, I eagerly waiting for and watched season after season fascinated by the plots and production.<br/><br/>Now for the really really bad.
Season 7 was utterly disappointing. The show was a direct punch in the face. I watched the whole thing just so I could experience it and comment on it. There was nothing of "horror" to it, as in past seasons. I honestly laughed throughout half of the show. There is no way of viewing it without understanding that the: producers, directors, writers, actors/actresses, the whole crew - were deeply and emotionally traumatized by the 2016 election. They took it so personally, that they did not care in offending and insulting half of their audience. Politics aside, this is Hollywood, specifically designed to entertain, and instead they dumped a huge steaming pile on any creativity they had left.<br/><br/>I don't care if there's a season 8, or 9, or 15 - I'm done . . . They've lost me as a fan. They ruined a show from a genre I thoroughly enjoy. I know that none of them give a crap about how fans feel, but I felt it important to at least voice my opinion and let others here know. I'm sure there are tons of fans that feel exactly as I do.
Be brave, be true to your self, and simply walk away from this hack show . . . Having watched most episodes of the series since start, the info that the latest season, Cult, would be "grounded, non occult" and being based on the 2016 election seemed like a better, fresh idea. Having seen this, being quite a fan of horror movies, and especially "AHS Freak Show"I've made one real disturbing reflection, and want to include a warning to both previous fans and new watchers; this is almost worse in every way than anything put out so far. Why?<br/><br/>Well, it depicts such extremely detailed brutal, deranged, scenes of perverse violence and mindless, senseless murders and torture it makes previous seasons, and almost every heavily censored horror movie, or other, ever publicly available seem like a nice family comedy. I'm not easily phased or judging, but this crosses the line of what should be done, especially as a TV series.<br/><br/>The main reason I say this is that I believe this could be like a lighted match thrown on barrels of fuel for those already violent, and/or mentally unstable with violent tendencies. I've seen documentary clips from Nazi camps experiments easier to watch than much of this.<br/><br/>It's no joke. A few examples: if you don't feel turned on by extreme detailed close ups of people being slowly executed by castration, nailguns through their head, hung in skin-hooks from the ceiling and stabbed in the heart and genitals etc, etc...do not watch it and do not have your kids watch it. I hope this is not taken as a teaser, or a spoiler, because it's not. It's just a small piece of a small part of an episode. And it made me not wanting to recommend it for anyone, or want to watch it anymore. Season 1 (Murder House) = 10 Stars
Season 2 (Asylum) =10 Stars
Season 3 (Coven) = 9 Stars
Season 4 (Freak Show) = 7 Stars
Season 5 (Hotel) = 10 Stars
Season 6 (Roanoke) = 5 Stars
Season 7 (Cult) = 6
Season 8 (Apocalypse) = 7
Season 9 (1984) = 1 Star. Yes, that bad! Skip it. How ridiculous, unfortunate and predictable. . . .<br/><br/>The Antichrist defeated by a bunch of witches, ridiculous. . Clearly the writers haven't read the bible, they know not of the tribulation and the second coming of Christ. That would have been a far more fitting end to the series, than an Antichrist with the temperament of a teenage snowflake defeated by a bunch of mortal witches. . . . .<br/><br/>Unfortunate, because they could have done so much with the storyline, as suggested, yet the laziness and obsession with witches has been its downfall. . . It's like they just gave up, or ran out ideas half way through. . .<br/><br/>Predictable. . . It was pretty obvious how the series was going to end when Michael turned into a blubbering wreck, and had trouble with the witches. The power of the Antichrist seemingly lost. As I began to watch the last episode I knew it would turn out the way it did, and so I lost interest, in fact I knew by around episode 7 this would be the outcome, and thus the show lost its value. The writers really need to take a leaf out of the book of 'Game of Thrones' whereby every episode is a cliffhanger, and you just do not know who's going to get the chop. This very fact makes the series so strong, in real life you don't know what's round the corner, and this is what AHS should be aiming to achieve!<br/><br/>I really don't know what AHS has planned next, but I'm guessing it involves witches and houses. . . . . For season 8 I was super excited and onboard with the concept and imagery of the apocalypse, the cloudy nuclear winter and people in black hazmat uniforms, that was so beautiful. then on episode 3 randomly at the ending 3 new characters pop in and bring some people back to life.... instant out. ugh. the writing takes such cheap jumps in this show lately. like the sideways gun scene to hotline bling ending the hotel season. they have moments of brilliance and manage to ruin all the ambience by pandering these cheap cop-outs. disappointed. first 3 episodes were great then they ruined it. not gonna be watching the rest of this season it's way too dumb now with all the supernatural stuff randomly butting into this otherwise intriguing storyline. Spoilers - This was a real mess.<br/><br/>The script threw everything into the mix, tried to have clever twisty turns but just ended up with a thinly veiled Hillary murderess breaking her personal glass ceiling. <br/><br/>If I was a new liberal I guess I'd think 'Yey for wimmin' but since the females were largely selfish despicable lesbians, I really had to take a step back and question what I was being sold. <br/><br/>Guess the gay writers believe their own scaremongering paranoia and wish fulfilled the not-so shock ending. <br/><br/>Evan Peters was the only watchable actor and could have singlehandedly dragged this demoralising rubbish into black comedy land. <br/><br/>But no , the lib preach had to be spoon fed just in case we were still in the dark. A drug dealer turned snitch was played for sympathy,of course. Poor harmless druggie , not as bad as female abused men who want jobs and a decent life with a regular female. <br/><br/>Guess this was token for the 'one year later and I still believe all the "literally Hitler" campaign smears' ,to help the snowflakes dream of sheep.<br/><br/>Extremely condescending American Horrow Story was really good in the beginning. I loves Asylum and Freak Show. I wasn't able to finish watching Roanoke or the hotel one, and I'm even less impressed with Cult, the current one.<br/><br/>Cult started off really good, scary in a different way, more psychological than the rest, but by episode 4 deteriorates quickly into gory stupidity. If they wanted to make the parallels to Trump through the crazy, cultish character, they could have done a better job. It could have been scary yet realistic, which is actually scarier than anything fake. Make of scared of what could actually be, instead of some far-fetched idea of what scares us.<br/><br/>People are not scared by gore. They are repulsed, grossed out or even fascinated by it, but scared? Not at all. They really lost the plot on this... I found this last season to be the least interesting and developed in regards to story. and Overall it was an interesting premise, with a rushed ending.The first few seasons were unique and had me waiting for the next episodes out of curiosity. But, this last season only had me waiting for the ending, and when it did end, I felt ripped off by the "kill all" finale. Some characters seemed superficial, and the ones that are well developed just end up getting killed off in the finale.... However, I did enjoy the three episodes that featured Wes Bentley as a supernatural entity on a mission to collect the souls. I'll definitely watch next season with the hopes of it being better than "Freak Show." I'm sure plenty of people enjoyed "Freak Show," but I felt let down after following the entire season. Well, I guess you can tell by my rather strong summary that I do NOT like the show. Perhaps as some other reviewers have written here, it could be the particular 'Type' of 'Horror' or whatever, but all I know being an AVID Horror lover that as far as I am concerned, this ISN'T it...<br/><br/>Now, the first season I will admit that maybe it just wasn't my type of thing; perhaps there was quality there, but I found the family so pathetically unsympathetic that it was a total turn off. And, some of the sleaze that was thrown in, appeared to be exactly just that... Thrown in... I didn't find the stories involving or entertaining. But, I'll give that the first season about the family MIGHT be entertaining to others who like more coldly unsympathetic characters and jarring sexual 'inserts' that have absolutely NO purpose, certainly not to scare anyone.<br/><br/>Primarily my summary is about the 2nd season. So, since I gave up early on the first season I thought, 'Good, maybe since the 2nd season is about a haunted asylum instead of this STUPID unlikable family, maybe NOW we can actually get into some interesting Horror.<br/><br/>Uh..., NO.<br/><br/>Not even bloody close...<br/><br/>In the first 8 minutes we are subjected to no less than 3 INCREDIBLY STUPID sex scenes and THE most juvenile, low-brow ULTRA-Clichéd Slasher dialog EVER to 'grace' the screen. What is this, CINEMAX AT DAWN or something...??? LAME... The couple going into the old asylum give about THE most inane and truly extreme pain-inducing dialog that I think I have ever heard. Then we are 'blessed' with the chick giving a bl0w j0b to the guy while his arm gets ripped off while sticking it through a door. Yeah, REAL entertaining stuff... GEEZ... Uh huh... maybe for like 13 YEAR-OLDS!<br/><br/>Trite, absolute NON-Horror in any form, and filled with just about THE poorest 1980's Slasher, clichéd, absolute bottom-of-the-barrel mindless dialog.<br/><br/>NO Horror at all. No Tension or suspense WHAT-SO-EVER. This strikes me as the kind of stuff that a room full of the lowest common denominator teens would think is 'Cool'.<br/><br/>Trust me, it isn't...<br/><br/>So much for the intriguing Haunted Asylum premise... <br/><br/>And, as VERY intriguing as season 4's Freak Show theme is, I just can't seem to quite get it up for it... First season fair, second season on the nail, third season just OK.<br/><br/>After the first season which I only watched half-heartedly and found a bit silly I wasn't expecting much from the second but was blown away by it. It didn't care. It went to all the dark places you don't want to go and it made it meaningful with Sister Jude's story being such an engaging drama throughout.<br/><br/>It never stopped plunging the depths of human misery! <br/><br/>I even loved the Monsignor as the secret enabler of all evil, Sister Mary Eunice as both the virgin and the devil, Farmer Hoggett as a Nazi (though the opportunity for a "that'll do pig" was constantly wasted) and Lovejoy as a convincingly disturbing rapist! They were all brilliant.<br/><br/>The only thing it could have done without is the aliens and maybe Kit and his girlfriends altogether didn't need to be there. But then the ending for Jude wouldn't have been quite as sweet and the identity of Leather Face *cough* I meant Bloody Face of course, wouldn't have been as obscure.<br/><br/>Again in The Coven I found Kyle and his girlfriends a meaningless storyline and he didn't really need to be in it at all - My God, the part where Zoe's hell is "me and Kyle breaking up over and over again", seriously???!! Hell in the second season was a far greater reality on this plane than they make it seem in The Coven. Just pathetic whingey 13 year old versions of hell...<br/><br/>Madame LaLaurie only would have been successful if she'd never changed and hadn't become so weak. She should have been doing what she did in the attic of the house throughout. She's played by the woman who gave the word Misery new meaning! She didn't even end up overpowering Fiona in her murderous intent, though. I wanted to love Fiona because I had such respect for the actress after Jude, but it just felt like she'd already made her mark and was just there cause everyone would be like "where is she!?" if she hadn't been Supreme.<br/><br/>The ending was anti-climactic. I expected Madison had possessed Zoe when she died at exactly the same time Zoe came back to life and thought Queenie was going to come through as the true Supreme when it was revealed - because if Madison had possessed Zoe it would prove Cordelia didn't actually succeed in bringing Zoe back - thus proving a flaw in her powers that meant she couldn't be Supreme. If Queenie had been Supreme then Voodoo and Witches would have combined for an all-powerful race that obliterates the extremity of differences there were between them in the past AND giving us all a valuable lesson...<br/><br/>The witch hunter company... meh... reminded me of when Angel became a little dull and overthought with Wolfram and Hart at the core of everything.<br/><br/>My favourite Coven member was Nan bar none.<br/><br/>So many flaws and I did SO want to love it, because Asylum is my favourite modern day horror series. I give AHS a ten though because I can't deduct points due to loving Asylum so much! Short non-spoiler summary: In the wake of a miscarriage and other problems, a couple moves to Los Angeles with their troubled teenage daughter. The incredible deal they get on a beautiful Victorian home turns out to be as a result of past tragedies on the grounds, and the house comes complete with creepy, intrusive neighbors and a mysterious housekeeper. Badness ensues.<br/><br/>I would categorize the pilot of American Horror Story as 'unrelentingly unpleasant, cynical, and fetishistic horror'. There are clearly fans of this approach... other films that come to mind are 'Event Horizon' and 'Saw', as well as most other torture porn, where most or all of the characters are unlikeable and the psychological brutality and dread are non-stop. It's arguable that there is a sympathetic character here, Vivien Harmon (the mother), played by Connie Britton, though I found her less and less so as the story progressed, much too weak... Her inability to communicate, her detachment from her daughter, many poor choices, etc. Dylan McDermott as her husband is even weaker, and other characters seemed equally single-minded.<br/><br/>The clichés also abound (haunted house, twins, dead animals, shadows of hooks, the easily seduced husband, ghost babies, etc., etc.), though the use of fetish gear as a horror motif was interesting at times. In fact many of the elements are fetishized and sexualized, a surprising choice for a TV series. And equally bold, though hardly commendable, is the exploitation of modern inner fears... teenagers all secretly involved in violence, self- mutilation, and Columbine-like thinking; Downs Syndrome children; etc. To my thinking, great horror or suspense is grounded by sympathetic or at least realistic characters, which gives contrast to the dread and a reason to fight. 'The Shining' is a prime example, as is 'Twin Peaks'. There are characters you truly care for, and who have something tangible to lose, and the despair is countered with humor. In comparison, this series is almost humorless and cynical to the core.<br/><br/>That isn't to say that 'American Horror Story' doesn't have merits. If you're a fan of similar projects, you'll find much to like... stylish surreal moments galore, some plot points are unpredictable, and both Jessica Lange and Frances Conroy ('Six Feet Under') are truly unnerving. Their unexplained connection might even compel me to watch further. And this is not one of those moody horror films with little going on ('Paranormal Activity', the original 'The Amityville Horror', much Val Lewton)... It's incredibly dense with action, plot points, and characters, almost to a fault.<br/><br/>'American Horror Story' was ultimately, for me, a trial to sit through. Not escapism, but possibly cathartic for those not offended, disturbed, or otherwise bothered. The first 5 seasons were amazing but the last 4 seasons are boring. I keep watching because I am hoping it will get good again but it still hasn't. Please come back to us AHS. Find your roots again. Alot of shows will have a bad season or two but I feel 4 in a row is saying something. Everyone has a different opinion because alot of people hate season 5 and it is one of my favs. What do I know? My review consists solely on the eighth season of the show because it captures so many different plot points of most of its preceding seasons.<br/><br/>The good:
<ul><li>As always, most of the main cast delivers fantastic performances.</li><li>The writers meticulously crafted a universe which cares about their previously established narratives even though it does not align well at times due to its vast complexity.</li><li>The show itself has always shown actual interest and respect for the genre, thus delivering engaging, suspenseful, diverse and well-made horror stories. This season is no exception!</li></ul><br/><br/>The bad:
<ul><li>The inclusion of so many different plot points makes the season convoluted.</li><li>The plot line brings the characters to a situation impossible to resolve without pulling off an "Endgame" move.</li><li>The final showdown is absolutely anti-climatic and disrespects the very nature of the characters.</li><li>The ending renders all efforts leading up to it absolutely pointless because certain events apparently are inevitable and unavoidable.</li></ul><br/><br/>The ugly:
<ul><li>"The wokeness" reaches never before seen levels of stupidity and anti-intellectualism. The writers clearly despise masculinity and heterosexuality in most of its forms, which has been the case in the majority of seasons of AHS but this season trumps all previous hatred.</li></ul><br/><br/>
Even though it has its flaws, the show itself is so well-made and engaging that I can excuse its unbearable political agenda, and I will always be eager to see where the creators take the show next. And all though I enjoyed Apocalypse to the level of binge-watching the entire season, the cons outweigh most of the things the season did right. It is a shame that viewers nowadays cannot enjoy something without it being about politics.<br/><br/>My rating refers specifically for this season. Definitely loved following week to week!10! BING WATCH! Is the best!!! What I love about this show is that it is unique, dark, special and not like everything else. It is well done and the actors are amazing.<br/><br/>The only downside is the last season, 1984. It's something all horror fans have watched several times and it's getting old. It is not unique or special like the rest of the show, so that was honestly a big disappointment.<br/><br/>I will still rate 10 stars as I love all the other eight seasons. PLEASE Quit while you're Behind. This show has gotten worse and worse from season 4 on. Season 1-3 were good. 4 was watchable, if only for Jessica Lange and Matt Bomer. Season 5 only for Matt Bomer. After that, some random episodes were amusing in a ridiculous way. Now it is just utter and complete TRASH. Poor imitation, unoriginal garbage. So disappointed. Have the actors (I use that term Very Loosely) in Season 9 Ever been in anything that is Not a Ryan Murphy show? I miss the days of enjoyable Ryan Murphy Shows, when they were cutting edge, original ideas and filled with Great actors. This show was enticing in season one, great in seasons 2 and 3 (I dislike witchcraft as a plot but "Coven" was fantastic). I even enjoyed "Freakshow" and "Hotel". But I couldn't finish "Roanoke" (Not a fan of the overused Documentary Format). "Cult" lost its luster early on, and the 2016 Election premise was overused and tiresome come 2017. (I don't mind conservative or liberal leaning movies, but this one just got boring. My news apps have been filtered to exclude political news.) I haven't seen Apocalypse yet, but I imagine I will enjoy it a bit more. I don't think the creators foresaw such a long living franchise, hence the sequels with the same actors. I think they are officially out of ideas. Need some new writers to come in. Maybe do an "Alien" or "Conspiracy" theme. Edging into sci-fi, but hell, it's better than the Election theme and reused ghost story for "Roanoke". I've watched AHS since the beginning. But the ending of season 6 was stupid and an insult to the intelligence of the viewers.
But 7-no Kathy Bates, so it was a pile of rubbish.
And 8? Even the most talented people-Bates and Lange-couldn't save this from being cringe worthy.
Please get some decent storylines for season 9, and spare your loyal fans (for now) from more mindless drivel. This has been my favourite TV show since it started. It was quirky, unapologetic for its weirdness, original, and interesting. HOWEVER I have tolerated season 6 up until halfway through episode 7 in the hope it was going to improve but it has not. What went wrong here? This season is a bloody mess and has nothing of the brilliance of the previous seasons. It started off with a lot of potential but went nowhere with it. I have purchased blu-ray's of all other seasons but I won't be buying this rubbish even for the sake of completeness. Perhaps this is the end of the road for American Horror Story. This season has tarnished an otherwise iconic show for me. worst ever got through 4 episodes who ever wrote this has never interviewed mote than 1 person about a paranormal experience I found so far fetched over dramatized why go that way actors were bad in performance they so much better in previous seasons I'm just waiting for it to end please guys do better don't go for the based on true events use the imagination that got me hooked from first season not badly written crap like this waste of time of film Don't get me wrong the rest of season were awesome cant wait for next season this one is a bust I used to look forward to Wednesday and you great show what happened tried to do like is this format Just finished season 1 (Murder House). I have to say the writing left a LOT to be desired. So many plot holes, so many loose ends, so many "oh, come on!" moments. Suspension of disbelief is one thing, but this show asks you to be an idiot. (Well, I guess I am one because I watched the entire season).<br/><br/>Honestly, I wanted to like this show. I kept overlooking the bad writing, the bad acting, and the script issues. I figured in the end, it would be worth it. But by the time it was over, I was left very disappointed. True, there are some good sub-stories within the over all tale, but they're ultimately left hanging. The end falls flat, and too much is left unexplained. I have to preface by saying that I don't believe in critical review of film or television, for the most part I cannot see the purpose it serves. This time however, I want to urge you as an audience to rethink what you feel for this show.<br/><br/>I think anyone who has ever seen a Ryan Murphy show knows how lucky he has gotten with his actors. From Joely Richardson on Nip/Tuck (a whole other issue) to Jessica Lange on American Horror Story, and most everyone in between. He is lucky in that he has written perversity beyond and surpassing any I have ever seen, and was able to find incredible actors and actresses to take part in it. And do not get me wrong, it makes perfect sense that someone would want to take part in what he wrote. One could argue that, at the surface of things, Ryan Murphy is a good writer. He wrote surrealism at an impeccable level, and he knows what people want to hear, and he understands what we eat up as an audience. He knows originality and he knows about pushing the envelope. What he doesn't know is that those things are not, and have never been, the most important. One could argue that I would not have known this either, had I never seen his shows. Bear with me here when I ask whether or not it is important to you, the intention of what you are being told. Is it important to you as an audience, that the story you are being told is based in authenticity. Ryan Murphy works with the understanding that good television is "new" television. It "pushes the envelope", has never been seen before, and is original and he executes this notion in his writing, at the expense of truth. Ryan Murphy cares more about the shock value of what happens to his characters, than what it actually does to them. I believe he must have noticed his inability to keep a character together for longer than one season, so he decided on an anthology series; as I said this is not a stupid man, it is an inherently manipulative one. If you have ever seen Nip/Tuck, at one point you have to have realized that these people are never going to be okay. You can't actually care about these characters because if you did, you're a sadist for sticking around. Ryan Murphy pushed these character over the edge early on, for the sake of shock value. He cannot help it, it comes through even in this series, and you cannot tear away because you have never seen something quite like this, quite so godless.<br/><br/>If you are going to disturb a character you must be able to bring him back. If what you are making is solely for the purpose of ratings you need to re-evaluate yourself. You cannot back it up with scathing dialogue and "true events". It is not enough to be a good writer; it is more important to be a truthful one. <br/><br/>I read something that Sean Penn said once, and when I read it I didn't know what it meant, but I get it now.<br/><br/>"I've always operated under the notion that audiences don't always know when they're being lied to, but that they always know when they're being told the truth. If there are what I think are unsung truths to be talked about in a film, through a character, through a story, and that dominates the piece, that's the key for me. I think the biggest thing is to not participate in the damaging, lying cinema."<br/><br/>I urge you as audience members to remember this when you watch television, when you watch film. If ever you cannot tell whether you are being lied to, ask yourself whether or not you are being told the truth. I'm sorry but I think this season is not as enthralling as the previous ones. I heard about this show a while ago, but only started watching it in 2019. I finished all 8 seasons in a matter of 2 weeks. THAT how good it was. I was not able to stop watching it. I actually did not know what to expect. I haven't read anything about the show, and no one was telling me anything, so I just entered in the story completely "blind". Let's review all 8 seasons, shall we?
Season 1 (Murder house) - Excellent season, it gets you hooked since the start. It takes you awhile to understand what is actually happening (or at least it took ME awhile), but everything is explained pretty well later on. 7/10
Season 2 (Asylum) - Really dark season, almost entirely filmed in one place (asylum), but doesn't lack intensity, horror, anticipation and greatness! Sarah Paulson and Evan Peters are rocking yet again! 9/10
Season 3 (Coven) - Amazing season. We see some new caracters, and of course a lot of old ones. Kathy Bates, Angela Bassett and Emma Roberts were EPIC! One of my favorite seasons! 10/10
Season 4 (Freak show) - I honestly thought I might just skip this season, 'cause circus was never entertaining for me. But I decided to give it a chance. And I never regreted it! So incredible! Finn Wittrock playing the role of Dandy was super convincing. I mean, I was buying what he was selling! Amazing acting. Jessica Lange shows what star she really is. Only sad thing about this season, was knowing that Jessica will not be returning to other seasons. 9/10
Season 5 (Hotel) - Most hated season by many people, but my personal favorite! Lady Gaga was sooo awesome. And I love the fact that vampires are not described as classic ones we've all heard about. Like Lady Gaga said - "You can live forever, but only if you are smart" (meaning that they may be vampires, but their bodies are still human, and can easily get hurt). Dennis O'Hare was actually hilarious and so incredible. Evan Peters as a bad guy - perfection! 10/10
Season 6 (Roanoke) - Ok, so this one was a bit confusing in the beginning, but not at all bad. It was pretty cool, once you understood what is actually going on. And it was most definitely not predictable. Seriously, you don't know what will happen, until it happens. Still, not one of my favs. 6/10
Season 7 (Cult) - The moment I saw this will be political season, I thought to give it quits after first few minutes. But than I reminded myself - this is AHS, so the season WILL turn out to be good. And of course - I was right. Evan peters again playing bad guy, and his true talent as an actor shows up. I mean, that guy can play ANY role you throw at him! As well as Sarah Paulson. Great season! 8/10
Season 8 (Apocalypse) - Mixing Murder house, Coven, end of the world and Antichrist - guys, I was literally BLOWN AWAY! Episode 10 (and the last one so far)...I laughed, cheered, screamed, cried, laughed again...OH MY GOD! I kind of predicted the ending itself (you will too, trust me), but that is only like 2 minutes before the actual end of season. Seeing Sarah Paulson's caracter from coven (Cordelia) continuing sacrificing herself for the coven...brought tears to my eyes.
Best season so far! 15/10!
So there you go. I really hope this review will help you in some way. I can not wait for season 9 and 10. And I hope they will make 10 more seasons after that!
XOXO, peace out. I absolutely love AHS. This new season is starting off with a bang! I'm hoping it delivers! American Horror Story consistently raises expectations, only to meet them with lukewarm themes of horror, forgettable origin stories and a cast of recycled characters who offer little by way of range and as consequence, they come off as stiff and wooden when delivering their lines. Where the series succeeds tremendously is in marketing the AHS brand. Through stunningly evocative visuals advertising the show across various media platforms, the flame of curiosity is lit and further investigation uncovers trailers which thrill through the beauty of AHS's costumes and settings. However the actual experience of sitting through a season of AHS is a mixed bag. Initial episodes may tantalize, but as each season progresses, the show becomes progressively stagnant and you may find yourself skipping ahead (netflix users) in the hopes that by doing so, you'll happen upon a scene that resuscitates your initial interest in the series. To sum it up, American Horror Story would make an exquisite theatrical production or a unique addition to the realm of performance art, but as far as being a standalone series, this viewer feels as though AHS failed to live up to its potential. Season 6 first 2 episodes are like a cheap Grade B horror movie. Testimonials by different people than characters, wow, so suspenseful. After a while, you cannot wait for them to return since the scenes are downright boring and predictable. This is like a Blair Witch re-enactment and the color is bad enough that it looks shot in black and white. What a total waste of streaming bandwidth. I fell asleep during Episode 2 waiting for something interesting to happen. If you are into Origami paper cut-outs dangling from trees and "scary" voices at night...this is the show for you. So bad, having problems talking anymore than a few lines but IMDb wants 10 lines. So let me repeat the last line. As for me, 5 seasons were enough. I started watching this because of a recommendation from a friend, I tried to watch the first series but it got worse as it progressed, I then started the second season to see if it was any better and I could do this because of the anthology feel, and I was delighted at how the quality had gone up, it was fantastic and the new setting and the villains were incredible with some fantastic performances, however the third seasons start was just slow and felt like being dragged along after the second seasons solid start, and I could not finish, and Freak Show was a great premise, the clown ideas were incredible but as soon as he was killed off I lost interest with the villain becoming some moany posh boy who was just annoying. I have not watched the fifth season yet but I am not hopeful. This is yet another show that has successfully deteriorated with each iteration. This was achieved through some truly awful script-writing and storytelling along with some of the worst acting you're ever likely to see.<br/><br/>Relying heavily on clichéd stock characters in ever increasingly unbelievable scenarios American Horror Story offers so little in the way of scares its frightening.<br/><br/>If you're hopeful about Kathy Bates and Jessica Langes presence in here you have my sympathy. Kathy Bates in particular is almost unwatchable as she churns out lines in her "flavor of the month" accent (yawn) and poor Jessica Lange playing the faded beauty in every season is just lazy storytelling by anyones standards. (and the German accent is almost as bad as Kathy Bates...) In short, while the first season offered at least the occasional fright and feeling of unease, the ongoing seasons only serve to make you feel uncomfortable by virtue of how bad they are. I wonder how bad season 5 will be...? After all the hype, I was expecting something great - a contemporary take on horror, perhaps a show trying something different, shunning the clichés in favour of being inventive. I was expecting good acting, good writing, and a good narrative. <br/><br/>Instead, I got some cliché-ridden adult version of Goosebumps. I actually laughed at all the wrong places. All the characters are disposable archetypes with about an inch of depth, and none of them are likable - which means the 'horror' really isn't all that horrifying. After episode 1 I was hoping the whole house would swallow them up. <br/><br/>I honestly feel like I watched a different program to all the people lavishing praise on this. I'm so disappointed, because I feel like there hasn't really been a decent attempt at an episodic horror show in a long time.<br/><br/>Ah well. Maybe the success of AHS will encourage better writers and producers to take up the gauntlet and do something I do actually enjoy. The first two seasons were great. The third started okay but flew downhill half way through. Each season forward has become worse and worse. Last season was a Trump/Republican bashing marathon that I gave up on half ways through. I said I wouldn't but I tried this season and after two episodes,I'm done for good with this show. Episode two takes us to complete perversion. Nearly everyone is a lesbian or gay and we are treated to a gay sex scene complete with leather outfits. Later a man tied and whipped for being gay which he enjoys. With 2% of the worlds population being actually gay, I find it offensive that Hollywood keeps pushing the gay agenda onto the world. I don't care if people are gay and they shouldn't care if I'm straight. Just keep your private choices out of our faces. This ruined this show for me and I hope it gets cancelled. I keep waiting for this series to get better. It gets worse. I'm done Up until this season, with the exception of the "Hotel" season, I have watched this show with great anticipation. The "Cult" season has really gone a little too far. It used to be witty and with a great story line and plot. Now, it has turned in to a political platform to serve the Liberal media, which I find VERY distasteful, and outright sickening. Sorry, just my opinion and maybe most of you like it, but there is enough of that going around already. They have taken a good scary, intense, mystery and used it for more hate, and we have enough of that also. SO SAD. The gay, and other sexual scenes hold no purpose whatsoever. Again, SO SAD. Too bad, but this is another show taken off of my recording list. To me, this is more proof of the moral, and ethical decline of a once great country, but will not survive this onslaught of hate and moral decline. I could only watch 10 min. of this show before deleting it. Love this series!.<br/><br/>There's a lot of macabre fun to be had here.<br/><br/>Damaged family unit moves to LA's "Murder House" and further damage chillingly and entertainingly, ensues.<br/><br/>Ghosts and ghoulish etc are thrown up at you like you're on the Ghost Train, unlike most though, this one is well worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>Just got through the Halloween episodes(what a brilliantly realised couplet) and find that, at the moment at least, the new family's seeming unawareness of the supernatural can rob you of traditional horror jolts, but at the same time, it fuels the show's genuinely unnerving creepiness. It's a strength not a weakness. Jessica Lange also in vintage form. No one plays Southern Belle quite as well as Ms Lange who already has an Oscar for it - Blue Sky - and seems set to add an Emmy. After having watched American Horror Story's first 5 episodes, and really really giving it a good try, I have decided that it lacks a certain reverence. These things that they are playing up, murders, home invasions, animal cruelty, they all really happen. I think that it is sad that we have to celebrate and trivialize such things with shows like this.<br/><br/>I am from Richmond, Virginia. A few years ago there was a terrible murder there of an entire family. Two little girls, and the mother were raped and murdered while the father was forced to watch. It was an absolutely horrendous event that will affect me for the rest of my life, just having been from there. When I saw the home invasion episode, it stuck with me how crass this genre can become. These events REALLY happen in people's lives, I don't think we should make a whole entertainment thing about it.<br/><br/>For some reason I don't feel this way about Saw, or the general genre of horror in general. Perhaps it is because this is "too close to home". The Saw movie franchise is not disturbing because it is so unrealistic, that it is almost funny. However, things like this, things that really happen to people: home invasion, rape, school shootings, putting DOGS IN MICROWAVES, I don't think that we should enjoy this.<br/><br/>There is plenty of research done to support the idea that playing violent video games or watching violent film can suppress aggression in the real world. However, the level of violence coupled with sexuality is disturbing in this show.<br/><br/>I think it says ducked up things about humans and America if we sincerely enjoy the sexuality and violence the way they go together in this show. Violence should not turn us on, the way that this show purposefully makes violence sexy, really makes me angry. I dislike it very much. Interesting characters presented to us by competent actors are completely undermined by editors and directors that are far too impressed with their choices. What they apparently think of as a slick, smart, hip style is completely misplaced and very alienating to the viewer. If they would just get out of the way and let us watch the story unfold without the fast-paced cutting and the "artsy" camera movements, there MIGHT be a reason to keep tuning in to the series. After the first two episodes, though, I am completely turned off by their pretentiousness and have lost all desire to give the show another chance. American Horror Story series had lots of hype when it first began to air in here and of course i fell for it. I'm a fan of old horror movies and in my opinion Hollywood hasn't produced many watchable movies in that genre for a long long time. Money has ruined everything these days, it's just about making money and it's less and less about art and meaning of it. So i didn't expect much and frankly I wasn't disappointed.<br/><br/>First of all what i really like about the series is Jessica Lange, she really lifts the series to other dimension but in my opinion it isn't enough to make a full TV series. Many other characters were just miscast, for example Vivienne and Violet. They could be good for plain drama series, not horror.<br/><br/>Second of all I found the problems of each character somewhat interesting but at the end of the third episode it just gets quite plain and obvious.<br/><br/>Obvious, because everything's just told straight away and there's not much left to question. In other words, the series ends up repeating every single horror movie cliché in the book that should have been avoided. For a seasoned horror movie fan it's just painful to watch but for our google-generation it's just cut and paste and voilá it's your idea.<br/><br/>Cinematography is too TV-series-like to create suspense at all and pacing is too fast also. They could have done a solid mini horror series of about three episodes and kept up the atmosphere, avoided clichés and made something more special but now it's going on third season. There isn't many things to do in a haunted house and the whole idea is really worn out. Lots of creativity is needed to make something out of this theme and it may just seem that nothing's enough when the idea's really worn out.<br/><br/>I think mature audiences could get a little tired of the whole idea and the series is actually only compelling for teens and young adults. In summary the series is of course watchable and it's somewhat entertaining but you won't be missing much if you just miss it completely. I cannot even express how awful I found this show, it's badly acted, there is no connection between the ghosts and the real people, there is no anything really at all, it's constantly just weirdness pushed at you without a break and I didn't see any horror, well not what I would call horror.<br/><br/>The daughter, mother and father don't even communicate with each other when it comes to the things they see each day that are really quite bizarre and would make anyone question their sanity, these people seem to think its normal for people to appear out of no where and then return there with no warning.<br/><br/>It actually misses completely regarding horror as there is no horror. Don't waste your time like I did, I got 4 episodes in before I quit. This show is clearly not meant to be taken seriously. They literally stuffed every horror movie cliché into the pilot: the family buying a new house trying to rebuild themselves, the miscarriage, the house "changing" everyone in it, the psychotic mental patient the father is treating, things like that. There's no actual finality in it, and the events seem to be all at random, without serving a bigger purpose.<br/><br/>But that's what it's supposed to be. This show is supposed to be tacky, predictable and "shocking". The fact that most of the things that happen are obvious and the editing's choppy is what makes it entertaining. But if you're someone who can't take a joke, this show's not for you. This show brings out the worst of liberal ideals. When did American Horror Story go from "horror" to "political? I find it funny to see that this season of the show represents Trump supporters as evil and manipulative/get their facts from "Facebook"/ portray completely FAlSE information about how our president and normal white Americans who support him are "racist". Normally, shows that involve politics let you see fair views from both sides and imply humor from BOTH SIDES...why are they singling out Trump supporters? American Horror Story (Directors, Actors, Writers, and all other staff) you have lost my respect and views for good! This is just another way Hollywood/Democrats/Liberals stuff people's minds full of innacurate, confrontational BS to support the strategy "Conquer by division".
For the record...when do you ever see trump supporters beat up a liberal or democrat and when has any of the criminal activity done by liberal radicalism's ever been proven untrue? I can name countless times Deomcrats/Liberals have stretched and altered the truth AND BEEN PROVEN GUILTY. Do you honestly think the MILLIONS of Americans who witnessed news on ALL media platforms regarding the barbaric acts of Anti-Trump protestors will sway their opinion because you manipulate the facts to cause confrontation and doubt? DON' let this idiotic, joke of a season fool you...<br/><br/>American Horror Story...get your facts straight and just end this miserable streak of a worthless, disappointing television series already please. Leave political issues out of an already suffering series. Notice that I refer to this as a drama. That is because there isn't really anything scary about American Horror Story and that's not just me being a macho man. Apart from a few jumps, the only thing that freaked me out was the intro to each episode. The into is probably the best thing about the show. It's really eerie and deliberately makes you feel awkward.<br/><br/>But I gave this thing six stars not two, because there is a reasonable amount of story here and for about half the series of 12 episodes I was eager for more. But then it began to feel laboured, I felt less and less warm to each of the characters and holes started to appear in the plot that you could drive a bus through.<br/><br/>The problem we often have these days post 'Lost' is that writers think they can create a world and a host of events without any explanation to it. If in doubt, just say something like 'In the end, Frank had been dreaming all along' and you can get away with anything. I did like the anthology/ short story style to the series and at times I found myself getting absorbed into the historical stories and the overall idea which I won't give away. But I just stopped caring about any of the characters after six episodes.<br/><br/>It's difficult to say anymore without giving the story away, but personally I won't be investing any more of my time in this. It would have been better as a one hour Twilight Hour episode.<br/><br/>Finally two of the things that bugged me amongst the various 'That doesn't make sense' moments I had was firstly that some of the 'ghosts' bore their wounds from their deaths such as ripped flesh and others (mostly the main cast of ghosts) didn't. This just seemed to be one of them ideas that if it just works better that way visually lets do it that way.<br/><br/>The second annoyance was the over visual polishing of the characters you often see in American drama's. I mean, even in her darkest hours it looked like someone had spent a ridiculous amount of time grooming Vivien's hair and applying make up to her face. I watched the show with no expectation at all, and that was a good thing I think. The actors are good, the picture is nice, the editing is a bit uneasy as is the rhythm, but it works. <br/><br/>But very soon, I start noticing the references and it bothered me. And this show is very well documented. Actually, it's a best of every horror pictures that has been made, not only long featured films (Darkness, Amityville), but actual living peoples(Zombie Boy), short films (Quays Brothers, Naiade), photographers (Witkin), music video (Nin's Closer) etc etc. There is no gap in the bibliography. But, it's so well done that I hardly notice any creativity, it becomes really dull quite soon. There is no surprise, it has been seen so many times. Even the plot is not new ... But maybe I am too big a fan of this kind of stuff. <br/><br/>Thou, there is one thing that I really enjoy : the bad dialogs. There are so unnatural that they become very funny, and I'm pretty sure it must be done on purpose, because dialogs are usually not the strong suit of the horror movies. Fake and unnatural is always fun to my ears, it relieves the tension.<br/><br/>So, if you're a big fan of horror films, you'll will probably feel the show dull and smells like the old recipes we've seen again and again until it became almost bleach today. So no creativity in this area. Still, it's viewable. If you're quite new in this area, you'll probably spend a good time eating popcorn protected by a blanket.<br/><br/>My only regret is that the whole stuff is so heavily borrowed ... it seems a bit ungrateful not to hint to the predecessors. I haven't read or watch anything about the making of this show, but I do hope they share the bibliography. Dont bother with this season. By far the worst one ever. They've gotten away from what made the show good to begin with. Focus of first few episodes is over the top objectification /humiliation of men, which is uncomfortable to watch. Enjoyed previous seasons of AHS and was looking forward to this season. Unfortunately, the writing is poor and the story in not interesting. The first 10 minutes of episode one promised an interesting take on the Armageddon story for the modern age. Instead we get a Gothic horror obviously written by a third-rate Mary Shelly wannabe. Please go back to what this show is best at, taking a historical horror or odd situation, and creating gripping characters and twisted viewing. <br/><br/>The obvious virtue signalling and SJW agenda are pathetic, but they might be bearable if the story was well crafted and the characters believable. I feel so sorry for the cast having to deal with such terrible material. For one thing, the special effects rock. For another, the acting is pretty darn good for a TV show. Great cast. For another, they deal with things that most people find distasteful--the evils of Catholicism, limbo, after death sex, human nature, animal brain. We are all animals without anything called a soul and this movie delights in that. There is no God or gods. Everything is up for grabs in the universe. There is only chaos. You have no choices, all is chosen for you. I just love it!! It's an expose on the lies and deceptions behind all the actions we as humans take to get our way. Hooray, someone finally showed what the priests and nuns were really up to! In a very positive way, actually I really enjoyed to see something different on TV screen. I don't know how many if any TV show in horror genre exists today, but I believe there are no any. Anyway it is a start of the first season and it is too early to make a final conclusion.<br/><br/>I can tell from this fresh start that plot is somehow well known, and have nothing original in it, yet the representation of the ghosts is very original and unconventional. That part I liked a lot. I will not spoil here anything but it is interesting to see how they manage this, so many times known subject in different manner.<br/><br/>The camera work as well complete cinematography is very good for TV standards, more movie like. Same goes for the music.<br/><br/>So as a horror fan I am satisfied and with that Gothic touch in it, more than satisfied, but...<br/><br/>...as the characters is the most important part here, they are somehow partly developed in my opinion, and some of them are rather dull, like McDermott (the actor I actually don't like much) or non developed at all. But I suppose it will be developed through series.<br/><br/>So, what is most important here is for sure to bring the tension in the plot, and deep characters development as it is the core of this show existence. Without that it will fail. Back in '81, Stephen King wrote dismissively that, "Horror has not fared particularly well on TV, if you except something like the six o'clock news..." At the time of writing, the only decent television horror with teeth was Twilight Zone and Kolchak - and even those were watered down in the name of American squeamishness. Three decades later, the closest we came to satiating our growling appetite for the macabre was Supernatural - a fun Hardy Boys adventure in urban mythology. Nevertheless, this horror connoisseur felt a tad short-changed when Sam and Dean Winchester stopped fighting Wendigos and Bloody Marys, and got religion.<br/><br/>Stephen King added a proviso to his comment: "...there's something optimistic in the fact that people can still, in spite of all the world's real horrors, be brought to the point of the scream by something that is patently impossible. It can be done by the writer or the director . . . if their hands are untied." Perhaps this is what happened when Murphy and Falchuk crafted American Horror Story. Drunk on the success of Glee and Nip/Tuck, their money-men must have written them a blank check for this courageous product.<br/><br/>From the very first episode of American Horror Story, the dam bursts and floods my TV screen with my favorite archetypes of horror. Without giving anything away, I can say that all my old dark friends have gathered in this fun-house. Seasoned horror geeks will roll each episode over their tongues like exquisite Belgian chocolate.<br/><br/>Something tells me that behind their slick and stylish red carpet personas, Murphy and Falchuk are died-in-wool horror geeks who were just as hungry for a good creep-show as the rest of us. Well I was really surprised! After the middle of the road nonsense of Terra Nova which I had such high expectations for I saw American Horrow Story by accident and without any expectations I was blown away!<br/><br/>It is KINGDOM HOSPITAL meets American Gothic + the gift + eerie indiana with a touch of the haunting + desperate housewives + true blood.<br/><br/>The plot of the pilot was purposely unbalancing with little making sense and most future stories being alluded to but that sense of unease where nothing is what it seems to be really worked. The actors were OK - good; their characters were kind of repulsive but in a good way and you know things are just going to get worse for everyone. It wasn't really scary and in places it was laughable but it was also sooo weird that it had you waiting just to see what madness was coming next. I really like the idea that there is a good chance that everyone is a ghost and each persons perceptions are altered by the house and the kinky sex was effective at making you feel sick rather than horny. I am not sure where the show can go but if you just accept if for enjoyable, popcorn horror nonsense and don't think to hard it could be a great series but still too crazy to tell. The first episode of season eight is very amazing! What a sad series disintegration. We took in the first season, and noticed unusual amount of sex. Through the second season's asylum theme, the sex was there too, and maybe you could say it was an appropriate as they are a bunch of crazy people in the loony house, and are probably given over to a depraved sexual heart. But finally they just gave it up to the sick mind of Lady Gaga and said, hell see what she can come up with! well she came up with bizarre sex. The lady gaga season just has no purpose. If you want the weird and bizarre, watch season one. Then just stop. Season 2 is just odd, three on up you'd have to be high to tolerate, and if you are high I imagine there are better things to watch or do. Season 2, of American HORROR STORY is, as has been said many times, much better than Season 1. In fact Season 2 is so sad, brutal and yet absolutely brilliant, I could not stop watching it. I have seen just about every Horror movie there is, and I often feel so cheated, bored, or 'so-so' - so often bored to tears and often kind of angry with the shallowness and cliché. But the ASYLUM (Season 2) is by far the best mini series Horror I have ever seen. I was terribly fixated, and could not stop watching it episode by episode back to back. I had very real feelings of such utter despair and sadness, yet I was exhilarated, hopeful, happy and yet contentedly horrified. ;] Just brilliant. It's a damn great show until the end of Season 4 when Jessica Lange leaves, you should turn off, too. Useless garbage, Lady Gaga is so ridiculous and in the end kills the whole series. As it enters its ninth season, fans of American Horror Story should know what to expect by now from Ryan Murphy and his ensemble of spooksters. Each season is branded with a motif that draws inspiration from an unmistakeable moment in horror history, all wrapped up in a stylised package that's equal parts terrifying and enjoyable.<br/><br/>Whether its season one's supernatural nods to the haunted house genre and Ira Levin's Rosemary's Baby, the outstanding second series Asylum with its retrospective exploration of the horrors of mental health treatment and Ken Kesey's One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, or more recent seasons which tap into real-world fears of an impending "Apocalypse"and the growing social anxiety over terrorism and political culture (Cult).<br/><br/>Season nine is no exception to the rule, drawing its wealth of material from retro fictional horror and capitalising on the nostalgic 1980s vibe that's become so popular with modern storytelling (Stranger Things, IT). A synth-heavy soundtrack and unmistakably 80s vignettes are perfectly paired with slasher gore and some all-too-familiar storylines (Friday The 13th, Halloween) .<br/><br/>With the absence of some of Murphy's tried and tested heavyweights (Sarah Paulson, Evan Peters) this latest offering lacks some of the authenticity and character depth that has made the series such a success in the past. The overall experience, however, is a fun (at times ridiculous) ride for any fans of the horror genre. Bland, gory, and not at all frightening for season 8 which is a huge disappointment especially because season 1 was decent and it's also free on amazon prime. Watching this program is like watching paint dry. Good actors acting bad. Very poor. When I started watching this show earlier this month, I thought I was in love, murder house and asylum were great and I thought this would be my new show but then when season 3 came along my view on this show changed. Coven was not bad but it was just kind of there, the characters weren't very good and it was very misleading. It was more about Voodoo than witchcraft and there were too many visual effects. Now this is where I felt like giving up, season 4 started strong and had a very eerie feeling, I was excited to watch it but as they kept introducing characters it just fell apart. There really isn't a way to describe how Freakshow was bad, it was just very weird and got very dark towards the end. And the thing that bothers me the most is that they made Emma Roberts a main character in Coven and Freakshow. I just didn't understand what either of her characters points were, in coven she was a millionaire actress who lives in a school for witches, and in Freakshow she literally just stands there and gets mad at Evan Peters. I recommend watching season's 1 and 2, if you like those enough watch season 3, but don't waste your time with season 4. I haven't seen season 5 but I have heard good things. Season 1 gets an A+, season 2 gets an A, season 3 gets a C+, and season 4 gets a C-. American Horror Story (AHS) is to the main stream Hollywood "horror" story what Walking Dead is to the zombie genre. Except it far from as successfully implemented. Where Walking Dead expands and explores the social critique of modern zombie stories, AHS punctures every illusion and ridicules the shock effects of B-films.<br/><br/>AHS has borrowed from a lot of classic horror movies. The base plot of first season is similar to that of The Others (2001) - but dragged out, weaved in a circular story, messed up and almost evenly distributed across too many episodes. The neighbor's Downs Syndrome suffering daughter warns the main characters repeatedly and one becomes pregnant with a ghost - just like in The Kingdom (1994). In the extras a deleted scene of a waterfall of blood is shown - too identical to that from The Shining (1980)? The root of evil turns out to be a perverse doctor who performed illegal abortions (surprise) and experiments. That morale quickly got boring and seems misplaced in a series with constant mutilation and murder. But it was always welcome, because Dr. Montgomery comes with bits of the excellent Dracula (1992) soundtrack.<br/><br/>"Mental illness is a fashionable explanation for sin." <br/><br/>Similarly, in 2nd season it's always wonderful whenever we get to hear Helen's Theme from the Candyman (1992) soundtrack. Most of this season takes place in a religious mental institution - another common twist of taking something "safe" (home, asylum, Christmas) and turn it into danger. Themes now also include homosexuality, cannabis, motherhood and guilt. Fortunately, the silly ghosts are out. Facing the evil in the institution, trapping characters in prisons of social shame works much, much better.<br/><br/>But about halfway through the season, the plot flattens without sight of any nearby climaxes. The various plot lines ends more or less randomly. Some twists are just silly, apparently forced to fit the genre (Alma Walker turns ax murderer - really!?). The fine balance between acknowledging the icons of the genre and the blatant copying of clichés are routinely broken in AHS.<br/><br/>And it's more cozy than scary. The Germans know what horror is: For "cozy" they say "heimlich" (~"homely"), for "scary" they simply say "unheimlich". Scary is what turns safety into danger. In AHS, the horror B-movie fan is safely at home. But not scared and not in any kind of danger.<br/><br/>The IMDb average rating of 8.4 is an insult to ratings. I'll probably never watch season 3. There is so much other good stuff out there. I feel that the series would be a lot better if there were some respite or a glimmer of hope for 1 or 2 characters. Unfortunately, it is kind of morbid that ever character has an unhappy ending. The problem with that is that we as audiences tend to distance ourselves more from the character and show less empathy towards them. This is probably due to the fact that no good end comes for everyone of them. I hope the next series would have a character or 2 with decent endings.<br/><br/>Another downside to the tale are the absurd sudden twists which spring up without prior build up. I reckon some progressive build up would be good for certain scenes, for example episode 7 40th min. A random monster springs up from no where and kills Grace. This is not good story building. American Horror Story...be prepared to be scared! I have chosen to review this title after watching the 1st season multiple times and keeping up to date with the current season, Asylum. I'll have you know that this show is definitely not for the faint hearted and not at all for young eyes. Although it is a horror series, the emotional cuts leave you hurting deep inside for each character and whilst at the same time, you feel angry towards each character and their motives.<br/><br/>Starting with season 1, a family of 3 moves from Boston in order to bring their family back together after the father, Ben Harmon, had an affair with one of his students and the wife, Vivian Harmon has a miscarriage forcing her to give birth to her dead baby. Their daughter Violet is a cutter and seemingly depressed but finds comfort when she meet her dad's new 'patient', Tate Langdon. Throughout the season, you have provocative maids, burnt men and high school massacres haunting your television screen. It is up o you to decide who really is alive...and who is dead. Vivian falls pregnant with twins however, one is not Ben's child, Violet discovers a shocking twist to her 'life', Ben finds trouble with his mistress, Hayden McLaine after finding out she's pregnant but, can Ben put a stop to all of this business? Can he? A strange girl across the road, Adelaide, struggling with downs syndrome is found often sneaking around the Harmon's house whilst her mother is stealing and hurting the family. You are taken back in time to previous residents of the house and how they suffered, whether they survived and how they have impacted the Harmon's!<br/><br/>Season 2; Asylum, although the season is only in the midst, it doesn't mean that there isn't enough showcased to write a review! An old TB ward is brought out by Nuns and transformed into an institution for the criminally insane. Run by the iron-fisted, Sister Jude and the sick- minded war criminal, Dr. Arthur Arden, the asylum is filled with terror. The main plot is based around a serial killer named Bloody Face who skins his victims and removes their heads. A man in his 20's named Kit Walker has an odd experience with aliens and is committed to the asylum for his crimes. A doctor named Dr.Thredson judges Kit based on whether he is fit to stand trial or not. However, it is later shown that Kit is not Bloody Face, Dr. Thredson is! reported named Lana Winters sneaks into the asylum and is unfortunately held there whilst her lesbian lover is blackmailed into committing her to Briarcliff. The season flicks between both 2012 and 1964 quite often and leaves viewers baffled with the outcome. Including a possessed nun, a Nazi doctor, a nun with a shocking past, a serial killer, an unlucky lesbian, a woman who cut up her family, a nymphomaniac, a pinhead, Anne Frank, A killer child and many more, Asylum is the number one show on television at the moment. Questions have been asked during the season, will Lana escape the clutches of Bloody Face, will he be caught, will Kit get fried on the electric chair for someone else's crimes, who will survive and who will escape?<br/><br/>In 2 words, GET COMMITTED! ahahah<br/><br/>Both seasons for me, weren't at all scary but given that I am a horror freak, it is not likely that this show would scare me, however, for most others, this show is a terrifyingly scary show with so many shocking twists which will leave you hanging for more!!! The first two seasons were fresh and unsettling; something that kept me coming back for more. Season 3 and 4 were worth watching, though nothing overly special. Hotel was completely mediocre. Roanoke was a complete and utter disaster, descriptions which lend the 6th season far too much credit. Season 7, Cult, is an absolute on-screen representation of Trump derangement syndrome. Neo-Marxist drivel and shock-gore coalesce into one of the worst seasons yet. The ostensible Oppressors vs the Opressed. Men are evil, women are virtuous and good. My God, what an all-time low for this series. I truly lament the path this show has chosen. What an intellectually vapid season. I am disappointed in myself for actually finishing this vacuous, leftist inspired, intellectually dishonest hogwash. 3/10 is generous. Wow, this new one had an amazing first 10 minutes or so. Then it went south real fast. Might be the first time I don't make it through the first episode. I've seen a lot of TV shows in my life, so I like to think I'm pretty adept at discerning the good from the bad. Each year, I like to give every new show a chance to see which ones are worth my time and which ones I can skip. I didn't quite know what to expect when I heard Ryan Murphy (of "Glee" and "Nip/Tuck" fame) was making a horror series, but I am a horror fan so at the most I just expected to have a little guilty pleasure every week. What I got was not what I anticipated--I never expected that it would be as good as it is. And it is GOOD. "American Horror Story" is one of the best series I've had the pleasure of seeing on TV in a long time. I'm tempted to compare it to the classic "Twin Peaks" in terms of its ability to unnerve the viewer and create a genuinely unique atmosphere that's rarely ever seen on U.S. television. The writing just "pops", for lack of a better word, and tingles with little crackles of inspiration and genius. There are so many quotable lines in each episode. And the directing is pretty unconventional as far as television goes--moody, cinematic, and possessed with an often schizophrenic insanity that takes you from extreme close-ups to some uniquely paced and edited scenes that leave you wondering why so many other series seem to be directing-by-numbers. As for the acting, let me just say that Jessica Lange is FANTASTIC as the next-door widow, Constance. Her performance is Emmy-worthy and every scene she's in is golden. Great acting and dialogue. Connie Britton is excellent as usual and fails to disappoint and Dylan McDermott plays her sleazy, morally- challenged husband quite well, providing just the right mixture of disgust and pity for the character. And need I mention Frances Conroy as the housemaid? Anyone who's seen the woman act already knows she's great.<br/><br/>"American Horror Story" is unlike anything I've seen on television in a long, long time, but it isn't just original--it's GOOD. Very good, in fact. It will creep you out, make you laugh, and bring you to tears, sometimes all in one episode. If you enjoy good stories, appreciate good acting, and love to get a little scared, there is simply no good reason not to be watching this show. It is truly a revelation and sets the bar for what all TV shows should aspire to be. After watching this, you can barely look at the medical dramas/cop/crime procedural shows without a little disgust. The kind of quality on display here is what all networks need to be demanding from their shows. Seasons 1-3 were decent. Clever even! Then something made Ryan Murphy decide to pivot the show from horror to comedy. From dark to campy. From clever narratives to childish pop culture commentary. We get it - you asked your niece what's cool right now on Instagram - we don't need full seasons about it.<br/><br/>It's tragic that talent like Jessica Lange, Kathy Bates and Sarah Paulson are playing second fiddle to acting hacks like Lady Gaga, Billy Eichner, Leslie Grossman (ugh), and Cheyenne Jackson's butt.<br/><br/>The last few seasons I've tried to watch but they are just horrible. I miss the days of quality acting and writing. Bring back Clea Duvall, Lily Rabe and Zachary Quinto....and tell them to bring some writers. Wow! Just Wow! Season 8 looks great. Joan Collins has still got it. Sorry, but Season 3 is like Hanna Montana when it used to be Silence of the Lambs, so I'm pretty disappointed to say the least. This season is so diluted and so inane I don't even know where to start. First of all, it's about witches. And I don't mean the scary, depraved kind, like Sigourney Weaver's Snow White. No, for this season, let's break out the incense, the crystals and make it as close to Twilight as possible. This horrid and vapid black hole even has a witch who pretends she's Stevie Nicks while Fleetwood Mac plays in the background. Yes, you heard me right—As Fleetwood Mac plays in the background. What happened? Season 1 and 2 were so incredible, so awesome. I can almost smell the insane asylum of season 2what a strange journey that season was. So, writers of season 3, please continue to work on the next twilight sequel, instead of ruining one of the greatest shows of our century. <br/><br/>Oh, and by the way, if you happen to be African-American, plan to be triggered to the utmost generational degree as the writers gleefully and with seeming impunity use the horror of slavery as a platform for ratings. TLDR: Not recommended if you're not into super low-budget production with terrible acting.<br/><br/>This show is like watching an endless late night TV B-movie with low budget production. How can you people enjoy watching this when there are hundreds of creepy thrillers and horror movies in existence that make this show look like a joke!? And that whole love story between the blond boy and the girl (Taissa Farmiga) is so BS. She barely met him at a party for a few minutes and now she wants to resurrect him, and goes to his house to talk to his mom? Jesus SHE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW HIM!! They talked for a minute at a fricking party...<br/><br/>The scene with the obese girl (who is part of the main cast) pleasuring herself for the minotaur was an eyesore and disgusting! An 8.4 rating for this mess? Please. Regardless of how well a show is, or how bad it is, I think most importantly is the fact that it conveys the right ideas. In this show, every single man is bad. Every single one of them except for Kid Walker who is a mangina who puts women on a pedestal and he does not accomplish anything remarkable by himself. Even in the final episode, there is an scene where there are two kids, a female and a male. One is told to go and conquer the world, the other one is told to look out for his sister and not to care about money. You can guess which one is which. <br/><br/>Funny how pathetically feminist this show is. Is bad propaganda. I think that scene that I just described is absolutely a horror in terms of what it conveys. Why not tell both of the kids the same thing.<br/><br/>Although the camera work is spectacular, I will not sit down and give this show my views and neither should you unless: you would also sit through a show of the KKK, Nazis, men mutilating women, slavery... This is just much more subtle. so many things wrong with this series...tried watching season 1 because of all the great anticipation when it first began...stomached like 6 episodes before i finally called it quits...i call myself a horror buff cause i love to watch anything that can make one scream...but American horror story fails and lacks lustre.<br/><br/>nothing makes sense in this series, it just wants to scare u but i say not in the right way...i gave it 3 out of 10, 1 for the amazing cast they were able to assemble for this circus, 1 for awesome cinematography and mood, and 1 for that there are series that are similar to this <br/><br/>i do see a handful of reviewers who agree this series is promising yet disappointing on so many levels.<br/><br/>watch it for yourself and see if u like it enough to continue....to me it's a descent into boredom there are other series that are way better... Spoiler Alert not really but I don't want to get blacklisted lol. I'm not in to long reviews and I always say if you look for a review watch it your self and decide on your own opinion. With that said I have a problem with holes in stories. So really...? A ghost can have sperm but can't have breast milk? WTF????? I am actually irritated from watching this but my girl likes it so hey what can you do lol. Really dead people should not be able to reproduce period it makes no sense. I mean that's God like isn't it? Are ghost to be considered Gods? I think not. I will say it's kind of like a soap opera. It's crazy to me how this has like 8 plus stars I guess I don't know whats good anymore. American Horror Story is about the Harmon family Ben (Dylan McDermott) who is a Psychiatrist, Viven (Connie Britton) who is a stay at home mother of one, and Violet (Taissa Farmiga) a high school girl who is troubled. They moved from Boston into a suburban section of L.A. and with full discloser of the Murder/Suiscide in 1994 that you find out about later in the show along with the ''Rubber Man'' who killed the homosexual couple who lived there before. You find out latter in the show in the episode ''Rubber Man'' that the rubber man is Tate who Dr.Harmon is seeing as a patient. So basically everyone who dies in that house their soul stays in that house. The show is mostly very sexually explicit. And there is crude and offensive language. For parents children under the age of 14 should not view this show because it is rated TV-Mature Audience (L-Language S-Explicit Sexual Dialouge V-Violence and Nudity) for a reason. This is such an awesome show. How could anyone be so inane as to say this show is a 1,2,3 etc. You are probably the ones who want more lawyer, cop, doctor, or reality shows. Finally main stream TV gets something with very good acting (an Oscar winner for Gods sake)and well out of the mainstream. All I can say, it's still an 8.5 show even with all you down graders. Watch your CSI and Private Practices and not watch this at all if you don't like it. Maybe Survivor is more your speed. This is made for people whom have an imagination that can enjoy something more than the doldrums' of now-a-day TV series. This is actually the first show on mainstream TV since 24 that I can't wait to see week after week. The first few seasons were great, but the last few have degraded into a hot mess on nonsense. 1984 takes all the worst pasts of 80s horror movies and tries to weave a story through them. I hope they don't renew this trash, it day has come and gone. Man was excited for this season then when I watched it got a few episodes in was thinking okay a little slow but excited to see where it goes... Then it's just another magic season might aswell just remake the covenant season... Disappointing so many different ways they could have gone and they just fish out of the same well. I love this show! But didn't watch Roanoke or cult all the way... these seasons were so bad I just couldn't! It started to go down hill at hotel. But apocalypse!!!! AHS is back beech! Watched season one - Great! Optimistically jumped into season two. Ugh! Only got a few episodes in, and decided to cut my losses and move on. I gave the series a 6, as it seemed a fair median between the two seasons I'd seen. Then, tonight, on a whim, we decided to revisit the series. I mean, maybe only season two was putrid, and was the exception. One way to find out. We started watching whatever season "freak show" was. With one exception, it was nearly as bad as two. Not even Kathy Bates could save this pile. The one exception was the clown character - who was terrifyingly interesting. With this being my third sample, I had to re-rate this a 4 - again, a fair average of the 3. 2 1's and a 9. Looks like they only had one season in them, then all they could do is fall back on the same old tired, standard, cookie-cutter content that almost every recent "binge" series depends on. If this season six is a parody on the genre of clichéd/trite hauntings from wronged past inhabitants who once lived in a rundown New England (or thereabouts) mansion followed by unexplained disappearances & murders with ghostly images, closing doors, things falling/flying and oftentimes filmed using the shaky camera redux technique then I give it three stars. Because, it had all that. Furthermore, it also had the overused shaky camera horror interviews of those who survived (or maybe didn't, but a filmed archive did), and even a shaky camera film crew meeting their demises from the ephemeral inhabitants. Otherwise, too much time spent on talking heads and everything else predictable. OK, so I just finished season 4, Freakshow. The first three seasons were amaze-balls. But this absolute rip off of of Freaks just had me reeling. How did they not even credit the original movie in the credits? Something like "An ode to Freaks"? I am so angry!! I cannot believe that there was not some sort of uproar about the theft of the intellectual property of the writer and director of the original movie! With season five just starting, Hotel, how can we not relate this directly to Stephen King's The Shining? What is the word for pathological plagiarism? I feel like crying. They could have at least thrown a shout out to the director of Freaks,a man who's career was destroyed for making his movie. Really guys? America...don't let these ass bags make you think this was their idea. Damn I'm mad. Kathy Bates... Ethel Darling. Holy crow. The accent is horrific. Worst character out of all current seasons in my opinion. I really cant believe that her character wasn't cut or changed in editing stages. Apparently it is a Baltimore accent that she is butchering but regardless of what it is, it literally made me enjoy this season less. I cant take her scenes serious whatsoever. Ethel Darling's accent is that of nails to a chalk board. Canadian, Irish, Scottish, English, New England? You watch the season and tell me. I expected more from such a great show. I loved the first 3 seasons. I need 10 lines ahhhhhhhhhhhhh Ethel Darling you need an accent coach I was really disappointed with the last episode. I honestly hoped that Dandy would have a more creative death. The tank with the water is too normal after all the wicked murders he performed. I was also very upset that the finale didn't show what happened to Pepper after all she was accused of. I also didn't see anything about what happened to Stanley in the finale. Yeah, the freaks turned him into a freak, but was he killed by Dandy? Did he die of Gangrene? I was curious to see more of him as a freak. And then, I was stilled curious to know if Chester ended up being sent to a Psycho Ward. I wish they would've come up with a creepy story about how the doll came to be in control of him. Overall, I wish that they didn't get rid of Twisty the clown so early on in the series. On a positive note, the show did keep my curiosity and I was still able to watch it until the end. The writers and actors of this show should be ashamed of themselves. I don't care how back water or ignorant you want your characters to be, but making fun of a person with down syndrome is incredibly offensive.<br/><br/>I had looked forward to this show coming out for months only to be so disgusted and angry within the first fifteen minutes to shut it off because I was so insulted. To hear Jessica Langes' character call her daughter a "mongoloid" and imply that she would have gotten an abortion had she known disgusted me beyond belief. I have lost any respect for the people involved with this show. This sort of prejudice should not be tolerated at any length. If this was a character being called any other racial slur it wouldn't be acceptable, and this should be just as offensive if not more.<br/><br/>I hope this show gets canceled I have to say I was somewhat skeptical when I heard about this show. Especially since doing horror in a serial series is difficult. But knowing the minds behind Nip/Tuck and Glee were at the helm was comforting. Honestly finding out that the guys who did Nip/Tuck also created Glee was surprising considering the massive departure. But I guess we all have our pet projects. Anyways onto the show...<br/><br/>Personally I like all the actors involved. Dylan McDermott and Connie Britton both give convincing and realistic performances. And the supporting cast fills out nicely. A couple reviews here write it off as nothing more than fun popcorn horror shtick. I don't see that personally. I mean it isn't horribly dark and weird since it's basic cable but it by far a step above most horror films produced today. Is it can't turn the lights off scary? No. I say this film succeeds better at being genuinely creepy. I've only seen the pilot but I like it already. Things make sense and the tension and creepiness are palpable. There is a lot of allusions to future scares and stories and lots of questions as to who is what and whom etc.<br/><br/>Everyone in show is not a ghost for sure. The basic idea is that the home is haunted or inhabited or what not and basically drives the people who live there crazy. I think more than anything I'm interested in hearing more of the original owner who was a doctor to the stars. It is implied that there lots of dead little ones or dead babies which makes you think botched pregnancies, experimentation, abortion, etc. That so far seems to be the darkest story but the other characters all seem to have their own story to tell as well.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what the perception of the ghosts/house changing by character means. This only appears to have happened once so far. But I am curious about the implication of this as well. Possibly a ghost manifesting itself in the most effective way to each person to make them crazy? Anyways, if you like something genuinely creepy that will make you anticipate what happens in the next episode this is the show for you. It is nice to see well done horror show come back to TV. They're extremely rare mostly due to the fact that they are hard to do. But this one seems done right to me. Every season, the first half is good, and after that everything gets boring, and then falls apart completely. Ryan Murphy just doesn't know how to conclude a story. Season 2 was amazing. It was scary. Now it's just a comedy with feministic one-liners. Or something like that. Boring. Lame. Generic. It's a Spanish soap opera with mainstream, overdone "horror" aspects to it. It's a complete waste of time. After Season 1 and 2 it was all a waste of time. The same characters is still okay but the witch thing was too bad. The story had no direction and anything was happening any time. I think there were just some random additions to the story at any moment. First two seasons gave hope but the the third season was such a bad one that the joy of first two seasons was gone as well. Do not watch this. This show is new every season. Introducing new characters, places and plot twists. It's on the darker side of television which is why it's intriguing to watch. I can't get enough! The recent negative reviews lack perspective. Hotel is the worst of the series, but only because it doesn't match Asylum and Murder House quality. The first two seasons were obviously foundational. Now the series manipulates and challenges itself on a meta level, which deserves appreciation. Cult and Roanoke in particular deserve more credit for their cultural commentary/satire. Recent seasons beg the question: How do we watch "horror" that's more "horrific" than our current cultural climate? I have been let down by American Horror story last few seasons, but when i started watching season 7 i was blown away from the first episode onwards.<br/><br/>The story is so different and the villain Kai Anderson is such a strong character i absolutely love his character.<br/><br/>Would rate this season 10 out of 10 Season 1- Good. The show was something new, at least for me and was entertaining. The performances were solid and the characters weren't bad. Good horror, not over the top and some good plot twists that weren't expected. Season 2- Pretty good- It starts out pretty scary but they use up all their scares in the first few episodes. After that it's a pretty good drama, but nothing really special. Pretty good performances again. Season 3- Utter trash. It is clear here that the writers realized that their main fans were people who would be entertained by anything as long as it was in there face. So they just kicked up their heels and wrote this farce. Jessica Lange was good for the first 2 seasons, but here she plays almost the exact same character as the first season, with slight differences. The writers relied on shock and awe to impress immature viewers even if it made absolutely no sense. Here is an example After a girl is drugged and gang raped, the pieces of crap escape into their frat touring bus(?) and drive off. She then comes outside and uses magic to flip the bus. This isn't the worst part of this sequence. Eventually they end up at the morgue to save the other witches beau. This is where it gets utterly ridiculous. For some reason the boys are cleanly cut up into pieces.... what? Blunt force trauma couldn't have done this to them, and these boys have families so there's no way that someone else did this to them, so why are they chopped up? I can see no other rational explanation other then it was shocking to some viewers. This made me cringe with its stupidity, it did not shock me. This season just crumbles from here into even more stupidity and bad acting from some supporting actors until I couldn't even keep watching. It would take to long to describe the other acts of sheer imbecility. I recommend watching seasons 1 and 2 and just skipping season 3 altogether unless you are easily shocked and entertained. No matter what kind of horror story you like: aliens, ghosts, psychopaths, and unexplained phenomena...it's all there under one package called American Horror Story. <br/><br/>American Horror Story is a frightening, fun, and unique TV horror series. At first, I thought it would just be another horror series with typical plots and characters. But I was proved wrong. AHS has blown me away with the depth of the story lines, the character development, and its unique style.<br/><br/>Every season plays homage to a different story in a different time period and setting. It's a great way to keep the show new and exciting, while sticking to its main genre of horror. The interesting thing is that the same actors and actresses play different characters, so it's great to see their wide range of acting skills and talents throughout the series. <br/><br/>From a haunted house to a mental asylum, then witches to circus freak shows...American Horror Story continues to deliver in its imagination, creativity, and shock factor. Best darned show I've ever seen. Watch this! The first season is on Netflix. It's the most original thing I've ever seen. At first when I saw that they had different stories but some of the same actors for each season, I was doubtful, but it's amazingly done. Jessica Lange and Evan Peters especially did terrific. Well, they all did, but I can't remember the other actors' names. It gets kind of messed up sometimes, like I can't even watch it, but then I always come back to it. I don't want to give anything away, though. The creators of this must be messed up in the head because I watch a lot of horror movies, and nothing scares the crap out of me like this show. Below is an excerpt of my review of season 1. Go to http://wp.me/pVGo3-NC for the full analysis! AHS, for all its disturbing imagery and shiny patent-leather production value, doesn't entirely take itself seriously. Not seriously enough to harken The Shining, at least. The makeup artistry and acting talent is on par with some of the best popcorn horror fare of the 80s and 90s (barely any CGI shortcuts here), but there is an underlying streak of parody and satire that sticks to the cornea like an eyelash.<br/><br/>The title of the show isn't any less self-referential, either. Producers Murphy and Falchuk aren't out to reinvent the genre in any sweeping way (minus a repertoire of unusual shots, cam-angles, and cuts). AHS playfully nods at an encyclopedia of various haunted-house mythos (see 13 Ghosts, The Amityville Horror, House, Poltergeist, The Exorcist, House on Haunted Hill, Hell Night, et al). Moreover, Murphy's fascination with the macabre shouldn't be surprising to ex-addicts of Nip/Tuck, a drama series that didn't shy away from its gaggle of "body horror" motifs.<br/><br/>Murphy does, however, break a couple barriers.<br/><br/>To wit, the specters in AHS move in out of their incorporeal, invisible states at will. It's almost too casual. There is no conjuring process, no Ouija boards, no simmer-to-boil buildups, no flying chairs or rattling pots and pans. Season 1 kicks off with the plain-as-day attendance of the dead, each with their own limbo-wheel agendas. They knock on the Harmon door as guests in flesh and blood; masquerade as present-day neighbors; or even disguise themselves as younger, more attractive ghosts — namely, as the quintessential everyman's wet-dream of a chambermaid (va-va-voomily played by Alexandra Breckenridge).<br/><br/>Within the bindings and rules of the mansion, in fact, they're able to maim, kill, copulate, and impregnate the living (more on that last bit, later). As the season ages, the ensemble cast's dead-to-living ratio becomes rather labyrinthine and hard to follow, which, in turn, makes it difficult for the viewer to form emotional alliances with the characters (spectral or real).<br/><br/>Secondly, the filming techniques are a tad perplexing. There are roughly twice as many shots per scene as there is for any other FX production (or standard TV show, for that matter). The dialogue goes by very quickly, and the breakneck shotlist follows suit. The effect on the viewer is one of disorientation and quasi-hypnosis.<br/><br/>The attention-deficit style employed here is certainly an "effect" well suited for the genre, of course, as it gives us an idea of what the characters' conscious POVs might be like — that "waking life" experience. Still (call me a traditionalist), I tend to prefer the Kubrickian method of shot composition akin to The Shining, where the camera rests in a fixed state as it conveys disturbing nuances and haunted symmetry. Conversely, the aftereffects of an AHS episode (on some viewers) is one of an "extended trailer," rather than a fully conceived hour of storytelling. Style, in short, tends to supersede narrative, and that's rarely a good thing in my handbook. I think this show is amazing I can't get enough of it. I mean I think if you seen every episode in order you will enjoy it as much as I do. I have friends who've seen an episode and said it's confusing but that's the thing that keeps it going, I've seen every episode and I still don't fully understand it either. Starting off with the characters it's like one episode you hate them then the next episode they're your favorite character. It's even more fun because you know things the other characters don't and it's like you're one of the ghosts and you're just there watching their lives. It's a crazy show but try and watch it and if you don't like the first episode try the second it may take some time to grow on you but I think it will. As an astute fan of well-crafted horror, and after reading AHS reviews here, I felt compelled to write another.<br/><br/>Is American Horror Story well-written and well acted? You bet. Are the emotions genuine? Yep. Is the show disturbing? Yes, but why? This is the question not being addressed by the reviews here. What makes AHS so disturbing is its AMBIGUITY...<br/><br/>One finds ones self asking (consciously or unconsciously) throughout watching this darkly satirical tale unfold, "did that just happen"? "What did I just see?" and "what's its significance?" Nothing is what it seems to the viewer, everything is a "couldve happened this way" even though I saw "this." Watching the show from the third party view, we see this manifesting in the plot development too. Is what the characters are experiencing true paranormal phenomenon or is it more akin to a sort of collective psychosis spurned by Ben cheating on his wife and losing their baby to miscarriage? what the French have dubbed (and what has been clinically verified) a "folie" a deux, tres, grande, or "familie" literally translating to a "circus" of two, three, many, or in AHS a whole family; where everyone in the folie shares the same delusions or hallucinations without necessarily sharing a biologic or genetic cause of them.<br/><br/>I shan't cite instances of this ambiguity to avoid spoiling the show. Watch for it consciously and you will see it consciously.<br/><br/>This is high psychological drama and horror at its most visceral and unadulterated best: a catalyst to cause the viewer through the plot development and characters to doubt what their very senses are telling them. This plays on the most primitive fears of man, the fear of the unknown in insanity and ultimately the fear of the symbolic "death" of the mind and thus of our very world.<br/><br/>As Iron Maiden asked "can I play with madness?" American Horror Story does, as titans in the horror world have for over 200 years, from Poe (ala "Tell Tale Heart"), to Kubrick's "The Shining", AHS takes the mantle well and runs with it straight into the depths of psychological hell. Most of AHS is great but Emma Roberts needst to go, what a HORRIBLE acting job. All she does is squeek or moan. She's just useless. This is regarding the first series. I probably won't be seeing the others.<br/><br/>It starts really good, but turns steeply downhill after episode five or so. And in the end I am really bored with it. Can't tell you why, for obvious spoiler reasons.<br/><br/>One a more positive note: Jessica Lange is truly magnificent. Her way of acting is amazing with her gestures and drama. <br/><br/>So anyhow: If you are a friend of horror do stay away from this. And if you are not a friend of horror you should also stay away from it, since there are some of it, at least in the beginning. Hence they managed to do a TV show for no audience at all.<br/><br/>But if you love Jessica Lange then maybe it is worth it anyhow. AHS 1984 (4.5 out of 5 stars).<br/><br/>1984 is one of the better seasons. The first season was great and every other follow up was disappointing and boring. 1984 is great. It is like a 1980s slasher horror film. It is plenty of fun. Plenty of fun bloody kills. Playing with the concept of teens getting killed at a camp. The soundtrack is great. The cast ensemble is great. They have fun with their characters. The script and direction is fun. Witty. And thrilling. The season does not lose its interest like the others when it gets far fetched or boring. Season 1: Murder House.
Walking into the season 1 pilot- I was already hooked. Great casting and fun story line. Wasn't sure what to expect and not saying I was 'blown away' by it but first season left a good impression for me.<br/><br/>Season 2: Asylum.
I have a love hate for this season. I loved the acting and it stayed pretty fast paced however all the side stories! Nazi's, The Devil, Aliens and Blood Face. Oh my goodness! The whole season was a brain full. Jumping from story to story and the cast was great especially Rabe playing a Devil nun but with all they had going on I feel they couldn't get just enough attention to 1 story and ended up rushing through them all for a "quick" closer with the stories left with no real closure.<br/><br/>Season 3: Coven.
Wasn't the biggest fan of this season sadly. The historical story lines with Bate's character? Brilliant. I loved it. Bates, Lange and Basset were honestly all this season needed. Take away the sorority girls and dump Roberts (sorry folks to me she will always be Addie Singer and her acting has yet to show me otherwise)! Yes, I realize the whole point of the season is working through to find the next supreme but all I took from it was a teeny bopper filler for younger viewers. Again I felt the finale was rushed. As it got to the last couple episodes I was bored and ready for it to end: which the ending? Seeing the leading ladies meet their fates was a wonderful treat even Paulson becoming the chosen Supreme. However I thought it was predictable it would be Paulson. The one they didn't put full focus on but was definitely the lead/anchor to the season.<br/><br/>Season 4: Freak Show.
I actually really enjoyed this season. It moved along pretty smoothly and it again like prior seasons the historical portion drew me in. It had me invested in learning more about the people the actors were portraying (or close in relation of who they were playing) and it added that much more 'realism' to it. I did find Dandy's story with family incest to be unneeded 'twist' and speaking of twists I was disappointed Twisty was killed off so early as well.<br/><br/>Season 5: Hotel.
Take out Gaga. Nothing personal against Gaga but all she was was herself in a non music video that ended up playing a lot of music anyways. O'Hare? Oh my goodness! That man was spectacular as Liz. He flowed, he had sass and so captivating. Peters? I wish they would make a H.H. Holmes movie and star him because another oh my goodness moment! Sadistic, enticing, intelligent and down right powerful with his vibes. Both men played their roles magnificently and one of them should've won the award. Overall I found Hotel was fun. The Halloween dinner, the games, and the hunts. Basset again delivers such fierceness that you're unsure whether to flinch or be trapped by her words. Bentley's character twist was a fun little treat as well. Paulson's 'Sally' wasn't my favorite role of hers. I feel Rabe would've been a better choice. Not my favorite season but I found it to be pretty fun.<br/><br/>Season 6: Roanoke.
There was so much potential to this season. So much, but this was the season that started turning me off. I see what they were trying to do but it was awful. I can't even give any props to the cast except for Kathy Bates who her character had me laughing so hard I cried- her character wasn't meant to be funny. Everyone else felt so unnatural in their roles. I thought they were going to crawl out of their skin and hide. I made it to the finale, however the season was so poor that the only deemed memorable is Kathy Bates as Agnus and Peter's getting a nipple rub down in a tub. Yes, I blushed.<br/><br/>Season 7: Cult.
I am going to start this by saying I wanted to gag and choke Paulson. Her character wails, and screams and cries due to phobias which that is understandable. Sadly for Paulson, she has the most annoying cry/scream in the world. The first half of the season she caused my ears to bleed. Her character development however was wonderful and I felt 'proud' of how much she grew by the ending. She even gave me a good jaw drop a couple times. Peter's was great as a psycho obsessed with control and death. Lourd was okay. I sadly found her character to be rather bland though. Over all Cult was pretty fun. I know it's not everyone's favorite especially with the opening scene being Peters aggressively dry humping his TV after Trump's win, but this season didn't focus strictly on politics at all except for creeping under peoples skin and bringing their fears to life by man who wasn't Trump at all.<br/><br/>Season 8: Apocalypse.
What happened? The season started great! Thinking it would be all 'dark and twisty' yet somehow becomes a pity story that turns boring and then is horribly rushed. Best episodes would be the first episode and the Murder House episode. It was refreshing seeing the first cast. Paulson, Bates and Fern however were great so I have no qualms with their acting by any means just the wasted story. By this point in AHS life I feel they are just pushing stories to make money and not really putting any 'heart and soul' into them. Okay, maybe that started back during Roanoke.<br/><br/>Season 9: 1984.
I made it 4 episodes and I treated those 4 episodes like background noise. I was excited and had hopes for this season but it essentially is just a parody. In 4 episodes I was bored, disappointed and lost all ability to care. Except for Lourd, the whole cast is kinda crap. Roberts acts like how she does in everything so her being a lead was disappointing and I was really sad not a single original cast member could be found. Not even the screaming Paulson who should have been the Camp adviser not Grossman. No offense to her but I can't take any of her roles seriously. I can't give much of any opinion though to be fair. I didn't make that far and I plan to take a night where the insomnia is bad and Ill start over and give the season a chance.<br/><br/>Final thoughts? Just stop making more seasons. The creativity has gone down hill. You've lost your strong cast, and the stories as of late have been nothing but let downs and now apparently a parody. Just scratch out the 'Horror' part of the name and call it American Parody Stories of Let Downs because what they started as is nothing like what it became which is one big let down. I wish luck for season 10, hopefully I can finish 9, but they should've put the nail in the coffin a few season ago. I'm obsessed with the horror genre and I love AHS! Every season I get hooked by the stories and the characters. It's SO well done and there's nothing else like it.<br/><br/>Unflinching, unapologetically dirty and gory. Yet you really feel for certain characters for different creative reasons. Every season I was afraid of being let down, they can't possibly all be that good?! But they were....until season 9: 1984.<br/><br/>What I was afraid of happening inevitably happened. It all went wrong. The magic was gone.<br/><br/>Please bring back the AHS I love if future seasons are to occur, I've lost my faith, bring it back better than ever. Please. Season 1 to 5 were the best tv you would ever see, unfortunately AHS has gone down hill since then, with season 5 being the last amazing season.<br/><br/>Seasons 1 to 5 had great atmosphere thanks to great camera work and editing, a technique to keep you hooked. Season 2 and 5 particularly stand out when it comes to atmosphere.<br/><br/>Unfortunately since season 5 every season has felt rushed and it feels like the writers dont care enough anymore. It's hard to rate the show since each season is different for me taste wise. I think the first and second season was brilliant but somehow it just went downhill from there. The last few seasons do have their merits but as a whole it drags down the rating from 10 stars to 8 which is still high. We'll see where it goes. What to say about this show... good grief. Obscene? Yes. Disgusting? Yes. Violent? Dumb at times? Yes.
But I have to admit, I love this show with every fibre of my being. The episodes are addictive and bingeworthy, and quite literally, never boring. The show always adds new elements to it so it never gets old. There are some good performances, especially from Jessica Lange (she's the best actor in the show, fight me.) The show isn't very scary; only with the occasional creepy scene among the gore. (The scene of the Rubberman standing behind Violet will haunt me forever though)
The seasons start out with good concepts, but get increasingly stupid and over the top as the season progresses. The show has genuinely funny scenes which I don't even think are supposed to be funny, which brings me to talk about the tone problem of the show. I seriously can't tell if the writers take the show seriously or not. The 5th season, Hotel, really highlights this. There's a scene where a man is being raped by some monster with a drill tied around it's waste. Later in the show, a ghost is setting up her own Instagram page. (Season 5 was genuinely bad and unwatchable, to be fair.)
A lot of the dialogue is pretty pretentious and edgy. Some of Evan Peters' performances are, in my opinion, kind of bad and melodramatic. There's some bad writing here and there, and some stereotypes and cliches. Season 4 was straight up homophobic for some reason, even though the previous seasons have had gay representation. (Not the best representation, but at least they were trying to be respectful.)
However, I do respect the show for being so out-there and really writing whatever the heck comes to the writer's mind. They never shy away from dark concepts and I have to give them credit for that. I also love how they rarely use CGI, and use costumes and SFX make-up to make something scary. In the fourth season, they casted actual deformed and disabled people to play the freaks, which takes a lot of nerve and really made me respect the show.
I genuinely like the show, but my god, it's so stupid. It's so bad that it's good, if you will. If you like the weird and gory, I recommend American Horror Story. When this show first aired in 2011, I watched the first and second season as they aired, I think I started the third, but I'm not sure.<br/><br/>In the last 7 days I binge watched all eight seasons, and I feel the need to vent opinion before I explode.<br/><br/>If I had to rank season 1 - 7, I couldn't do it, except that I would put season 3 last, but I would still give it an 8/10 while giving the others a 9/10.<br/><br/>Up to the seventh season I could only complain about one thing, but that thing I encountered in every season, keeping me from giving a solid 10 to any season.<br/><br/>It was the endings, this obsessive conclusion of every last loose string in the end, paired with way too happy endings in my opinion...<br/><br/>Every season would have profited from gloomier darker endings, but I don't wanna spoil stuff by going into detail here.<br/><br/>I was binging it because I heard of the connection between S1 and 8, so I was really looking forward to season 8. I even enjoyed the first 2 episodes, but it took a sharp turn after that.<br/><br/>It looked really promising to me. But now, having finished watching it, I wonder where the horror was in this one. In my opinion there was just no horror here, and the whole story seemed like it was written by a 10 year old.... a 10 year old on a seesaw, who wanted to bring the end of American Horror Story as we know it.<br/><br/>Well I hope any future seasons will bring the former glory back to the show... Season 8 started so well. Panic in the streets. A plane with no pilot. The mushroom clouds! The Outpost! Miss Venable, the dictator in purple! Warlocks vs Witches! And hellspawn himself, The AntiChrist!
The crossovers to earlier seasons didn't feel forced or gimmicky. Everything was good. It was cooking up into a beautiful piece of storytelling.
And then came episode 8.
Splat.
Something was added to the script team's coffee. Or maybe something was taken out of the script team's coffee. Either way, with episode 8 a great season hit the wall.
Sandra Bernhard took her club act to a black mass. Abuse and insults for the congregation. Hilarious.
For an encore we got the Puddingbowl Twins. Imagine Eldon Tyrell if he'd done coke and let his mother cut his hair.
The one truly AHS moment of episodes 8 and 9 was the pentagram of death. Shocking, disgusting, and brilliant.
Onward to the final chapter. I'm not hopeful. The biggest problem with this series is choosing what to watch next. An anthology series andvit seemed like each subsequent season got better and better. I'm halfway through season and it's the best yet. Great writing, excellent acting. Couldn't recommend a series any higher Initially hesitant to binge watch this show, I must say I was impressed by Murder House and continued watching. Asylum was pretty good too, Coven was BORING, slow and dragged on for too many episode. Freak Show was a different take on horror (not scary horror, probably the horror of humanity) and I enjoyed it as well. Hotel started off ok but the plot or lack of it is lost pretty much midway.
Roanoke SUCKED BIG TIME.
Cult could have been avoided altogether. The first few episodes were ok then it turned into a lost version of fight club and a meh finale.
Don't make new seasons just for viewers, come on, didn't anyone learn anything from Dexter?!<br/><br/>Not sure if I will watch Apocalypse after the wasted time on the last 2 seasons.<br/><br/>They might just make another season of "horror" on Scientology/moon landing next?! A show called American Horror Story has a lot of expectations attached. Watching the little vignettes that they put out prior to each season can really get you excited for this show. Watching the opener they create for each season also got me hyped. Sadly what your given is something totally different. The best way to give people & idea of what this show is..........if they don't know its creator is to compare it to other shows that are similar or actually done by the creator. So, if you are really into Charmed, Supernatural, Scream Queens, Melrose Place, Nip/Tuck, Glee..........then you will LOVE this show and think its super scary. If you ever thought of making a great horror show and your first thought was.......I know, lets get Lady Ga Ga, this is your show!!!!!!!!!!!
If on the other hand, your into, The Amityville Horror, The Shining, Salems Lot, The Exorcist, The Omen, then you will be thoroughly disappointed in this. The best that can be said is that season 2 Asylum was "watchable" To have a season that you are going to dedicate to witches, man the potential there........what a wasted opportunity. The crazy scary horror they came up with was a boarding school for teenage witches. You know, your basic Sabrina the teenage witch stuff. Anyone remember that thing that came out of the bathtub in The Shining?????? Now THAT is what i imagine a witch to be. Lure you into a room, appear or make me think I see a smoking hot naked women getting out of the bath, start getting a little action and............she turns into the most hideous hag, with her skin just peeling off her body and about 300 years old, laughing maniacally at me!!!!!!!!!! Instead we get some teenager, oh im gonna cast a spooky spell on you that will ruin your date tonight with captain of the football team. Ohhhhhh scary stuff. Its almost like they went out and got a different person to create the kickass intro to every season. Then said, thanks, you can go home now.........and proceeded to make a completely different show. 
What a shame. I was introduced to AhS just before s2 was released in the UK on the Fox channel and I liked it immediately. I watched s1 through 6 and now started watching s7 on netflix. For me personally this show was great upto season 5. Season 6 wasn't great but had OK moments and s7 so far just doesn't seem as good as the previous seasons. <br/><br/>My rating is mainly for season s2 which is my personal favourite. 
If you haven't watched this show yet I still recommend watching it. Its dark, bizarre and great to binge watch. Every single season is complete a diffeent story but they have something in common, little nexus. There is allways a bunch of hardcore scenes, sometimes some of them feel unnecessary but completes the mission of scare you as S%^t This is a rare treat I came upon expecting a rehash of old horror ideas and fake scares and thrills. Well, I was completely surprised by the first scene of season 1 episode 1 and I have been hooked ever since.<br/><br/>I enjoy the different tone of each season, the originality of the writing despite some well done themes e.g. ghost, witch etc. It feels fresh and unique in its category.<br/><br/>Evan Peters is fantastic in his ever changing roles just as the rest of the cast are. I need to point out Evans as he was completely unknown to me before AHS unlike some of the more established actors.<br/><br/>Superb show. Original. Scary. Horror. Enough said. I get that the 7th season tried to renew things with a political approach and could have been good except it wasnt. There is barely any story anymore, the reactions of the character are completely unbelievable, and farfetched, and the logic of things gets worst and worst.<br/><br/>I do not mind the impossible, when done well, But this show doesnt even try to put logic behind things, i feel like it starts by trying really hard on gore , depravity and sexual themes, and the story is a second thought that they build around the gore. <br/><br/>the seasons 1 and 2 were great, the 3rd great and bad at the same time, the 4th bad, the 5th good and bad, and then after that it just went really downhill.<br/><br/>Sometime i found myself thinking, are the gay directions doing sex scene just so that they can get the nice looking young male actors to expose themselves? Because i find absolutely no use to the overbearing nudity and violence. It just seems to me that more and more they run out of idea and just try to milk as much gay sex and awkward overused violence as they can As might be expected, AHS has some really big ups and downs. I fear it may be on the decline, especially of late, but I give it a 7 because of so many good episodes in earlier seasons, and I realize it is hard to keep coming up with original material at this level of the game.<br/><br/>Oddly enough, I started out with season 2 instead of 1, and that might just be what kept me watching. I asked my girl to watch season 2 with me one day, and we were immediately hooked. Jessica Lange is awesome, and the asylum setting made it feel like a movie. Throw in some religious motifs and temptations, some politics, Nazi doctors, and monstrous freaks, aliens, etc. and you've got a really weird circus that is interesting to watch, and generally well-written. Season 2, is by far, one of the best, if not the paramount season of this anthology. Absolutely amazing, and darkly gritty for a TV show. This is bold and exciting entertainment/horror.<br/><br/>Season 1 was OK, but had a weird feel to it, and I didn't really like much of it until the end. <br/><br/>Season 3 was intriguing, but it wasn't my favorite. Again, Jessica Lange and veteran actors were able to fill in the holes, and along with the generally decent writing and dark macabre action/magic, we continued to be fans.<br/><br/>Season 4 was a good one. The freaks at a carnival brought some truly odd and gruesome stuff to light, as well as the treatment of certain groups and races in that time. I like the shifting between different time periods in history--it adds a lot of room for different story lines and insights into our past, even if sometimes it is heavy- handed with a more modern PC revisionism.<br/><br/>Season 5= this is where they are starting to lose me. The Hotel thing was good in the first few episodes, and I love some Angela Bassett, who returned for a sexy and dominant role alongside Lady Gaga. Gaga is bizarre in real life, and also as a vampire queen on this show(or whatever she is). Somehow, though, I just started losing interest, and we quit watching half-way through the season. It just felt kind of bizarre(as always, and usually good) in a dumb way, and Cathy Bates was good like usual, but maybe we are just tired of the same people. That Paulson chick is back, but I found her character ridiculous and annoying, and the murderer ghost dinners just got stupid to me. The gay dudes competing for stuff and the bald crossdresser guy felt like a contrived addition, just to play off of Gaga's weird styles and PC messages about bisexuality or changing genders, etc. I don't know what it was, but we just got completely bored with the direction of this season after a few episodes. It seems to be more of a Lady Gaga commercial and a comedy than anything else. We never finished it.<br/><br/>6= The whole thing is so stupidly off course from their past greatness and writing and horror that I can't even deal with this one. The Intro. and music seemed absent(or maybe I had too many shots and simply missed it?) The whole premise was painfully contrived and idiotic from the start. A black man dating a white woman(I am not unfamiliar with racial issues or bias, as I am in an interracial marriage myself) is assaulted in L.A.= but by wimpy- looking white dudes playing the knockout game or something for a "gang-initiation"!!!! LOL. I laughed out loud, as I have never seen a white gang knocking out random black guys in L.A. I told my wife that they should have at least made it a realistic attack-- like police brutality on the innocent black man or a supremacist killer. This just seemed utterly fake. So then, they decide California is way too dangerous and awful(even though it is extremely liberal), and suddenly move to rural North Carolina? To buy a old house in an area that is apparently inhabited by inbred hillbilly cretins, who literally look like extras from Wrong Turn 1-5. Then, they get in a bidding war over the home with a group of these guys that look like Civil War era soldiers with down syndrome(you know, as every Southern person has to be an inbred mental cases that hates minorities and seeks to murder them in every show) that guest- starred on Deliverance. So, then Cuba Gooding, Jr.??? leaves his wife alone, in this sort of place with people that don't like them in the area, to go on business trips. The wife is pulled underwater in a hot tub, by a ghost? I don't know, I was so bored with the fake storyline and implausibilities and stupidity of the characters that I doubt I will be finishing the season until later, if at all. The whole thing is built on a dumb premise, and nothing was scary or intriguing about it in ANY WAY, compared to their other outings.<br/><br/>Like so many hit shows, this one is special, and has some awesome seasons, but the season are becoming less and less enjoyable and original(the fate of many great works). Also, I heard gossip about newer seasons being built around Trump and Hillary and the election fallout, so I can only guess this is going to be yet another SNL- esque bombardment of traditional Americans or a Trump whackathon ad nauseam(I don't even like Trump, but find the Hollywood cry fest to be tired at this point). If they go that route, I feel their show will really be out of ideas and tanking. Politics aside, they may want to move on to another project, as I feel the ship has sailed on AHS greatness. I rate some seasons at 9, and some at 2, overall. The first season is great. I would give it a nine out of ten. The horror is produced through the story line, which I won't describe here but will say that it commands your attention. The scariness is not the cheap kind, not the kind of fright developed via showing something suddenly and rapidly approaching the camera accompanied by loud noises. It is produced by the story itself. <br/><br/>The subsequent seasons I find unwatchable. For some reason the producer decided to begin employing cheap camera work to produce feelings of dis-ease in viewers: canting the camera 30 degrees off vertical either right or left, moving the camera such that the subject appears to slide off the screen, shaking the camera, switching camera angles so rapidly that one can barely make out the picture before it changes, etc. In addition, the background sometimes abruptly becomes very very bright, then reverts to normal, back to bright, and the subject of the scene is slightly out of focus on occasion. This all tends to disorient the viewer and instill a physical sense of uneasiness, just short of nauseousness. <br/><br/>Among a number of modern Hollywood producers and directors, the use of cheap camera effects such as these (and others such as e.g. jostling the camera while filming a person who is supposed to be running or jogging instead of simply having the person actually run or jog) is seen as legitimate, mainstream, state of the art film making technique. I see it as what it is, a cheap trick used in place of quality acting, writing, and directing. Visual effects can certainly make one feel dizzy, disoriented, and even nauseous, and these physical feelings no doubt add to the psychological discomfort one feels when viewing videos about murder, and other horrific subjects. <br/><br/>But viewers are not unaware that these cheap tricks are being employed in lieu of quality acting, writing, and directing. <br/><br/>I don't understand why the producers of this show felt it necessary to begin using these tricks beginning in the second season. They had already produced an excellent first season without resorting to them. They still had a great cast, and even brought in some more great actors in the subsequent seasons. What happened? Did they lose some of their writers? Did they lose confidence that they could repeat the quality of the first season? What prompted them to start using these cheap camera effects?<br/><br/>I was impressed with season one. When I began watching season 2 episode 1, I was extremely disappointed to run into these cheap tricks. I stopped viewing the episode. Using Netflix I sampled the first episodes of seasons 3 and 4. I found the same cheap tricks employed in these as well. <br/><br/>I will not view anything past season one. Too bad. It was good work. Season 7 Cult is grandiosely ridiculous. What exactly is the appeal of watching a badly written, predictable, unrealistic mess? There is no horror. I can help but think that the writers just want to make fun of the political climate and everyone. They laugh at you. If you watch this it will be undermining the real political issues because the plot in this season is utter dung meant to strike a nerve in some neurotic liberal fans perhaps, and outrage others. It seems divisive and silly. Can't take it seriously.
Children should certainly not watch it as it is desensitizing to various perverted subjects such as; Random violence, arguments, sexual perversion, delusions, among other things. The show starts a conversation but doesn't apply logic or explain it effectively. 
1/10 trash that is not to be taken seriously. I was very excited to watch the PILOT episode after I saw the first trailers for this new show on FX. There has NEVER been another TV series like American Horror Story, EVER. Sure, there are(and have been) many "supernatural" shows and whatnot, but NOTHING like this show. It is a truly groundbreaking series and there is nothing like it in comparison to other shows. It's completely new, unique, creepy, and a complex mystery/thriller, unlike anything else on television. I always anxiously await for every Wednesday night at 10:00pm to watch the next episode and try to figure out all the crazy and bizarre things that happen during each show. It's SO GOOD that when the episode ends, I'm thinking "Wow, that was incredible! Has it ALREADY been a whole HOUR that just passed by?!?" Yeah, it's that good(in my opinion), the time just flies by and it's over, leaving me in suspense knowing that I have to wait a WHOLE WEEK just to see the next chapter of one of the greatest TV shows in history. All the actors in the show are phenomenal, especially Connie Britton, Dylan McDermott & Jessica Lange, I'm talking about Emmy-winning performances. Kudos to FX for airing this incredibly awesome & addicting show and to all the people who created it, etc. I absolutely LOVE IT and will continue to watch every single episode!!! Season i would have rated s1 and 2 a 10/10 but the rest is not so good, Apacolypse started great and I was hooked, but after episode 3 I felt like the story changed. This show is great and entertaining with its unique and convoluted plot lines. You either love it or you hate it. The show has had ups and downs however and isn't very scary if that's what you're looking for. If you wanna try it out, I rated each individual season as this is an anthology.<br/><br/>1.) Murder House - 10/10, Scary, Thrilling
2.) Asylum (Best Season) - 10/10, Scary, Disturbing
3.) Coven - 8/10, Fun, Thrilling
4.) Freak Show - 7/10, Sad, Unsettling
5.) Hotel - 5/10, Strange, Disturbing
6.) Roanoke - 9/10, Spooky, Disturbing
7.) Cult - 6/10, Weird, Freaky
8.) Apocalypse - 5/10, Fun, Weird
9.) 1984 - 9/10, Thrilling, Fun I'd given up on this madness. After Season 3 I stopped enjoying. Only continuing because of my wife. Season 9, however was a goddamn treasure. Everything about it is perfect. I didn't want it to end. The show is brilliant, especially it's first 4 seasons, but it does take a dip in the middle, not coming back up until season 7. All and all, this is a show that you would love to watch reruns of. I've been watching this show from the beginning and have yet to get bored of it. Every season is amazing in its own way and I love the little connections they make to past seasons. My favourite seasons are Asylum Roanoke Cult and Murder House!!! Amazing show every year its different and entertaining. I was late to the AHS game, but a fan for life. I took off a star because I miss the fan favorites from the earlier seasons. Evan Peters, Sarah Paulson, Francis Conroy and Jessica Lange, oh how I miss you. I do love Billie Lourde though. Cult and Asylum were awesome, Roanoke less so. I know I'm in the minority but I loved Hotel too. I liked these seasons: 2, 3, 6, 7 and 8
I disliked: 1, 4 and 5<br/><br/>So overall okay show. This is definitely for the super horror fan type as there's lots and lots of gore! Not every episode has as much, but when there are killing scenes the blood is not cut short.<br/><br/>After watching the first season and then moving onto the second, that's when I realized each season was different. That was a different approach than most TV shows I've been drawn to, but nonetheless I loved getting to follow each season and then start over with another. It's refreshing and leaves you guessing how the next will go. They did try to reuse actors which was great, because they all seemed to do so well playing so many different characters especially Evan Peters (My favorite of them all). I will say that each season seems to be more bizarre than the last. The stories really go out there in the weird world. But it's great and I love every bit of what I've seen so far.<br/><br/>Other than an overall review of the show, it's best to review each season separately as they are all so different. Some I liked a lot, others not so much. But each one had something to offer.<br/><br/>Season 1 (Murder House): Although this episode is what drew me in to the show to begin with, it ended up being one of my least favorite episodes. The story was great and all, but it was so uncomfortable to watch for me in most episodes just because of the amount of sex and infidelity going on. There were some pretty strong characters, though. Connie Britton, Frances Conroy, Jessica Lange, and Evan Peters just to name a few. All in all, I feel like some things could have been left out. I still enjoyed watching it, though, just a little different for me.<br/><br/>Season 2 (Asylum): I loved this one and is probably my all-time favorite. Lily Rabe and Jessica Lange were my favorites in this season. Both of their characters were so fun to watch, especially Lily Rabe's "transformation" from the sweet innocent nun to the possessed demon who is still portraying herself as a nun. She pulls it off pretty flawlessly and it's quite hilarious to watch. Then of course the "name game" scene was great. The one everyone has probably seen somewhere on the internet. Loved it! The only weird part has to be the whole alien abduction bit. Not much is revealed to understand a whole lot of it. But despite that, it is still one of my favorites and I will probably watch this season again once I'm finished with the rest.<br/><br/>Season 3 (Coven): I have to say that the more I watch, the better the seasons get. This season quickly became another favorite for many reasons - It's about witches. The story line is intriguing to me and there are a ton of great characters yet again. A lot of the same, but there were several newer ones including Emma Roberts (personal favorite) and Gabourey Sidibe (who is quite hilarious). I loved the idea of the next supreme and how it went along with that story. It was fascinating to me and could just be because my fascination with witches and witchcraft. Either way, it was a great season to watch.<br/><br/>Season 4 (Freak Show): Another favorite. This season was so unique, especially when it came to the characters. I loved the authenticity of them in that they went out and used the real people instead of trying to make it work otherwise. It made it even better and more realistic in my eyes. Jessica Lange appears yet again, along side Evan Peters, but neither disappoint in this one. I loved the connection they gave everyone that worked at the "freak show" and it definitely made it more sad when one of them would die off. Saddest part was showing them all get killed - hated that scene! Also, that scene seemed a bit rush to kill them all off so quickly. But it was still quite a surprise. Definitely not always happy endings with each season. This one was probably one of the creepiest with the additions of characters Twisty the Clown and Dandy. Dandy has to be one of the most mental characters and made some parts of it so hard to watch. This is also one of the first seasons that ties back to others when they show how Pepper first showed up at the Asylum (Season 2). Despite the rough scenes, this was still enjoyable and suspenseful to watch.<br/><br/>Season 5 (Hotel): I can't say this is one of my favorites, but I did like it better than season 1. It took me a while to get reeled into it, but once I did it wasn't so bad. I loved that Lady Gaga was in it and loved seeing each costume she showed up in - they were just spectacular and so unique. The rest of the character's were fantastic in this one as well. A few of the same, but mostly seemed to be quite a few new ones as well. I just couldn't understand some of the story line and the "10 Commandments Killer" storyline was a little weak. A lot of it didn't make sense. This season also drew into season 3 when Queenie came to stay at the hotel. That was another fun bit and love when they do that. But for whatever reason, though, I still could not stay interested in this one for too long. That and the ending left a lot hanging which was a little disappointing.<br/><br/>Season 6 (Roanoke): This one went a bit differently than the rest of the seasons so far. It was basically a TV show in the making in the form of a documentary surrounding the house. This one is also one of the more disturbing. There seems to be lots more gore and is really heavy on the killings and demonic presence. The cannibalism and torture scenes were pretty intense to watch as well. Lily Rabe was one of my favorites in this one. Her emotions in some scenes were so spot on you almost thought it was real. Probably the most convincing of them all so far.<br/><br/>Season 7 (Cult): This one was super political in almost every way. The whole storyline was driven on all things politics in a "cult-like" way. This one is set more in present times so that was a nice change. This one also has lots of surprises surrounding the cult, especially the ending. Twisty the Clown makes yet another appearance in this one, sort of tying back to "Freak Show." There were some parts of this season that didn't really makes sense, but the twists and turns made up for some of that mess.<br/><br/>Season 8 (Apocalypse): This one was a fantastic season! You have to get so many episodes in before you see it, but this season ties back to both the Coven in season 2 and the Murder House in season 1. The season starts off one way with the world ending and the few chosen ones hiding in bunkers (seemingly no big deal), then it eventually switches around and goes a different direction. Without saying too much, there are lots of surprises in this one turning it into a totally different story with time-travel, a devil-worshiping cult and a big showdown between the warlocks and witches. The ending is a little sad, but I loved it regardless.<br/><br/>Season 9 (1984): All but a few episodes happened in literally one night. I couldn't believe it. Although this one was only 9 episodes, it was purely amazing, action packed and deep once again. So many surprises and so many great moments. Unlike the others, there aren't many original, frequent actors, but still had a couple that have appeared before like Billie Lourd and Emma Roberts who are both phenomenal yet again. There was so much to like about this one!<br/><br/>The best thing overall has to be the acting. It is spot on and I mean that. You will see most of the same characters being reused in each season, but they all play totally different characters (some total opposites of the last ones they played). I will admit it is hard to get past that knowing that you just saw them play someone else in the last one -especially when seasons cross over and you see the same actors playing multiple characters in one episode. Despite that, they are all so great and add so much to each season. Not every season is amazing. Not every actor is inspiring. But the spotlights are stolen by Evan Peters, Frances Conroy, Sarah Paulson and of course, Cathy Bates.<br/><br/>Truly unique. Truly inspiring work. Just amazing, something for everyone. Fell in love with the 'Name Game' song from the asylum series. Great storylines, nice plot twists and unexpected surprises throughout. Over acting is hilarious and shows the actors talents playing vastly differing roles. You will definitely bing watch! Seasons one, three, four, and six, are all I have willingly completed. After getting through three episodes of Hotel, I turned elsewhere. After four episodes of Cult, I have sworn off the series. While I appreciate the fictionalized world of Cult because it resonates with the ongoing political climate of the United States, it borders on nonfiction as well. Some of these seasons just go beyond the beauty of creativity, secretly picking at you when you otherwise felt safe, finally enhancing the unease of American nonsense. To this day, I could revisit Season 1 without hesitation. I hesitate to state that for any of the rest. Thank you to Sarah Paulson for keeping it real and holding my attention to her career, as I look forward to her upcoming work outside of AHS. One of the best tv shows ever. It's a top along with True Blood, Dexter, The Originals, and movies like House of 1000 corpses, Devils rejects, and Freeway 2 confessions of a trick baby. LOVE-LOVE-LOVE to watch! First few episodes of Season 1 have real potential, you have the makings of a good horror show. However, by the halfway mark in the first season it began to become less and less credible, sliding more and more into the realm of silly. Come the final episode it was a complete Pantomime. Way too many 'dead' characters, silly ploy lines, no longer scary at all, no tension just descent into the ridiculous. All of the 'scare' had drained away as the 'ghosts' become normalised by being on screen so much and interacting with each other or the living characters. <br/><br/>I watched this all the way through Season 1. The cast work hard but the fault has to be the writers. Another fine example of an idea that the writers do not know how to take anywhere that really builds it. <br/><br/>Won't bother watching the following seasons, this bored me by the end (really really struggled to endure the last few episodes - tedious). I enjoyed this show very much, American Horror Story has an effect of pulling in its watchers and taking them on a journey which leaves them hooked through every season. The characters have a huge influence on the story line leaving you attached to certain characters or actors, Ryan Murphy's outstanding writing has layers of possibilities you will see in no other show but this one, now going into it's seventh season i'd give this show a solid 8 while it is amazing I feel it dose not hold the same potential it did in seasons like murder house or asylum but still finds it's way back to its roots making you stay tuned for more of the seasons to come, knowing Ryan is behind the writing you always have something to enjoy in each season. The best of American Horror Story are among my favorite television experiences in the past twenty years. The writing, the production, and the acting combine great shocks, surprising twists, and likable, down-to-earth characters with an over-the-top morbidity. The most recent season (Roanoke) is by far one of the weakest. Like the Freak Show season, it takes an effective method so far that it becomes a joke. In Freak Show, the writers made the mistake of piling on oddity after oddity until the weirdness of it had become a gimmick. The same is true of Roanoke: the writers embraced the gruesome killing aesthetic, so that, by the eighth episode, I could no longer find any enjoyment in it. They had already revealed in the sixth episode that everyone died except for one, so the only thing left is torture porn as they play out the inevitable deaths of the entire crew. This is further destroyed by the depiction of the rural monster family, who have committed every possible sin expected of outcast rural weirdos: incest, cannibalism, drug addiction and production, and a Faustian deal with a group of sadistic spirits. I turned the eighth episode off after about twenty-five minutes. The first ever episode I watched of AHS was Season 3's head and the moment where Frances Conroy melon balled one of the council members eyes out I knew this was a show for me! At first I was confused with the whole 'mini series' concept and was trying to connect Zoe to Violet and Fiona to Constance but eventually after doing some research it all started to make sense. After that first episode I binged watched all the other seasons and previous episodes in a couple of weeks (best way to watch it IMO) and was successfully caught up to watch it live. And I'm very glad I did!<br/><br/>This show never disappoints and personally I don't think it can do any wrong! I've enjoyed every season thus far (some more than others) with Asylum being the best there is out of all of them. Personally I don't think AHS will ever be able to top it, but this current season (Roanoke) has come close. The characters are always great and the acting is superb even the sets and directing are fantastic. I find this series so good in fact that I've watched seasons multiple times and I never get bored of them. This may sound a bit sad, but I've watched asylum 6 times and I've enjoyed just as much as the first time I saw it. Other shows such as the walking dead are hard to re watch but never American horror story. It has quickly become my favorite TV show and I always try to get my friends and family hooked on it too, which isn't hard.<br/><br/>This show isn't for everyone and even the fan base seems to have varying opinions on which season is the best/worst but I'd certainly give it a try! It's always fresh, new, and exciting and there isn't anything like it out there. I've always felt that Americans horror story at its worst is still better than any other show at its best. not really any spoilers but....<br/><br/>i loved the first 3 seasons, the most recent one is garbage.<br/><br/>lots of bad acting and even worse fake accents. not sure why they even tried since it takes place in Florida.... maybe if they had some cubans it would have made more sense than the mix of trial accents.<br/><br/>michael chiklis is particularly bad and jessica lang is terrible as well. ugh.<br/><br/>the 'freaks' are pretty unsettling and their acting is actually better than most of the normals.<br/><br/>kathy bates is still awesome but i think she's the only one.<br/><br/>two headed chick from the back is obviously a rubber head stuck on a shoulder. reminded me of army of darkness.<br/><br/>my advice is watch the first 3 seasons and then skip this one. It's hard to give a rating to American Horror story. It's one of the weirdest shows I've ever seen on American television. I actually found myself thinking that it made John From Cincinnati seem normal by comparison at certain points. There's a lot of good here -- stylish directing, suspense, well done horror; but there's also a lot of bad -- over the top acting, poor characterization, too little normal life to balance against the weirdness of the home life (even the daughter's school is strange). I fail to see how a show like this could sustain itself for more than one season either. Eventually these idiots have to move or die. If neither happens by season 3, it would get hugely boring. So I give the show 5 stars. It has room to grow, but right now it's a bit of a mess. "Lynch" meets "Lars von Trier" with a mix of "Rob Zombie" and good old "Hammer Studios". I used to be a big"Twin Peaks" fan. I would say, American Horror Story" is something getting close to that kind of mind twisting Show. Weird twists and turns, there is something new behind each corner- sometimes to jump you- sometimes to confuse you. What ever lurks behind these closed doors in that haunting, you want to open them or walk of right the way. Some People won't even make it through the door.(Like my boyfriend*smile*) I'm sure many will say- "What a crap!" But !! On the other hand there will be many others taking a walk into that "Ghost Story". Believe me- you need to be a little bit crazy to enjoy the ride. But be sure- you wont be disappointed at all! Lean back and let it creep upon you. Just a suggestion: Invite some crazy friends, pop some corn - get beers and watch the show together. American Horror Story, is by far, one of the most disturbing TV shows that I've watched since Harper's Island. Many of the scenes on the show are filled with so much craziness, it's definitely not for people who are new to the horror genre. The plot of American Horror Story centers on a family who moves to an old and refurbished mansion to begin a new life after the husband is caught cheating. Little do they know, the house Is "haunted" by it's abundant secrets/mysteries of murders. While the plot does seem a little familiar, the show really does try to introduce to you tons of new twists and turns to keep you on your toes. Rather it's the old lady/attractive ghost maid that roams the house looking for the husband, or the evil mysterious creature that lurks the basement, the show never fails to spook and scare. Overall, the content contained on the first two episodes of the show felt like something that you would only see on season finales. There's so much action, suspense, spookiness, and even humor, that it just left me in awe. Highly anticipating next week's episode! Highly recommended for fans of the horror/suspense genre. When I first read about American Horror Story, I was a little unsure. I reluctantly watched it and quickly became entranced. By the end of the second show, I couldn't stop watching (luckily for me I happened to have the first 8 recorded in my DVR). I think it's excellent. There are so many supernatural dramas out there (and I love a lot of them), but this one is different. Anyone who loved Six Feet Under and watches shows like Dexter, True Blood, Supernatural and the Vampire Diaries should watch American Horror Story! I hope this show continues, because it's amazing! At first the show drops a lot of little hints and you have a lot of questions. Fortunately it's interesting enough that you want to continue watching so you can get the answers. The good news is that you won't have to wait long to have your questions answered. You'll know a lot more just three or four episodes in. I'm definitely hooked! WOW!! What a superbly acted, written and directed new series. As soon as I realized it had Ryan Murphy's magical touch I did not hesitate to tune in and watch the first episode.Having seen another of his dramatic series, Sons of Anarchy and Glee, both Emmy winners I knew the series would be a success, Ryan is one of the most successful writer producers in Hollywood and his record is second to none.Viewers, he has another hit on his hands and it is NOT to be missed. The unexpected plot twists and turns are superb and definitely leave you wanting more week after week.The chemistry among the cast is phenomenal. What a joy to watch the outstanding performances of Connie, Dylan, Taissa and Evan, a credit to the casting department.The addition of two-time Oscar winner Jessica Lange and Tony winner, Dennis O'Hare, formerly of True Blood, in supporting roles, further enhances the credibility of the show' theme. Unlike similar series, either past or present, American Horror Story is in a class all by itself. I look forward with anticipation to each episode in the future. Never sure what Jessica's character is up to next or Dennis's character's demonic misadventures will lead, are two more reasons to tune in. I'm not going to go into the plot because this is a review section. You can find the plot of the show through google.. First off, I am a huge horror fan have been since I was 10 so nothing really makes my heart race anymore. This show is beyond genius. The actors are on point, believable it looks like you are watching it happen in front of you. Even those who are not the main characters of the show are great. I will say not every episode has made me jumpy but a few out of 5 have, even so all episodes are great. The show is full of suspense from the first scene and is just a great realistic approach to horror. Each episode starts off with a different story about the house's history. Which I think is crucial to the shows plot line. The stories are not all played then at the end you find out why/what happened before. To all those "special effect fans" This is not your typical special effect movie. The only complaint that I have would be the music some scenes the music is non relevant to the story's tone. Some scenes where I feel they should have a more morbid/eerie music collection are replaced with just strange and for me that kind of killed some of the emotion of the scene as a whole. Finally I feel like I should take a second to mention this is NOT A KIDS show. There are adult situations, sex is common in the first couple of episodes. Not something you want your child watching!<br/><br/>They just announced on Halloween it will be picked up for a second season could not be happier.<br/><br/>We need this show! I hope you all continue to support the show. This show is the first of it's kind and possibly could be the one that can break barriers for future shows like it. Well, I have to admit that when I heard about American Horror Story before it's premiere I thought it was going to be extremely cliché, more of the same, etc. But I really paid for my words when I first watched it! The show is the perfect mix of the essential ingredients to create a modern, non-cliché, horror show. The series actually make subliminal jokes of the all-known horror clichés, and plays with them in a very unique way. I can't say that all of the thing that happens in it are unpredictable, but most of them are (prepare to get lots of scares!), but even the predictable events are treated with a fun, gory way that do not disappoints. Therefore, I wouldn't recommend the show for extreme-horror fans: if you like tons of blood, parts of bodies being ripped of people, torture and that kind of stuff, the show may get you bored. I see American Horror Story being a show for people that likes a good supernatural-caused scare, mixed with some black-humored laughs. I hope all the episodes sticks to the so far greatness, the last I watched was "Halloween Part 2" and any of them lost in quality yet! I first stumbled upon this show while looking for something that was irregular and distinct from most TV shows,I must say that i was a bit unsure at first but after watching a few episodes I was left captivated.This sort of show is not for everyone but for those who enjoy horror genres know that the key to an essentially good show is to incorporate a great deal of mystery and suspense within the plot and it certainly did not hold back in that aspect.This show has a lot of potential because it contains something most shows lack "substance". Even for audiences that would dismiss the thought of even looking at this show i would recommend they give it a try, it's definitely worth your time. The first show was intriguing and entertaining, it had depth with many twist and turns as well as suspense and good character development. The end was a great surprise. It seems after its success, the network wanted more shows so the writers grab for ideas that were either cliche or lacking any imagination. The shame of it is, they used a very good concept to push social agenda that is way out of sinc with a sophisticated audience. The attempt to appeal to a very minor audience has spoiled the intire series. What a shame. After watching the first series, I was happy to see a new series arriving. Only seen episode 1 of the second series, but seems just as good as the first. This series has lots of twists and turns, a lot of good characters and great writing. Any horror, suspense or thriller fans would be wise to watch this.<br/><br/>Even if not into the whole horror genre, I would recommend you to give this a watch. It's creepy and keeps you wondering without it becoming annoying (like Lost, so many questions and such a let down when answers came).<br/><br/>Give it a watch, you won't regret it!!!! I bought the first season a few days ago and I have watched with interest the whole season. Good acting, good plot, original ideas. The only thing i must say is that it is not quite a horror story. <br/><br/>It is just a metaphor about the fears of common people within society: fear to be a loser, to lose your family, your children, your job, infidelity, death, etc.<br/><br/>It is extremely funny the way the mental therapy profession is totally discredited and brilliantly depicted as useless (not without some reason)<br/><br/>It is all indeed a big metaphor describing the fears, hysteria and anxiety of society. In order to deliver this metaphor, a sort of horror story is created around a hunted house. The Story is good, the atmosphere is creepy, and it has some frightening moments and gives some good chills.<br/><br/>However, as i said, the truth is that despite being a horrifying story, in the end this is not a horror mini series, but a psychoanalysis style metaphor on the most common fears, anxieties and hysteria of society. American Horror Story is a dramatic horror show that premiered last fall on FX. Created by Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk of Nip/Tuck and Glee fame, season one starred Jessica Lange, Connie Britton, and Dylan McDermott. <br/><br/>In its first season, the show garnered 17 Emmy nominations and Lange scored a Golden Globe for her portrayal of Constance, a widowed mother with the most disturbing history with the haunted house she lives next door to, and in which the entire season takes place. <br/><br/>The main stars are the Harmon family, who relocate from the East Coast to Los Angeles after they suffer a miscarriage and an affair within their unit. This early conflict makes the Harmons the perfect victim to the "murder house" (as dubbed by locals in the area) with which they move into. <br/><br/>Each episode opens with a flashback to moments that have taken place at the residence involving other families and characters. Horror fans can appreciate the incorporation of actual horrific events like the mysterious Black Dahlia murder and the infamous Richard Speck murders of eight Chicago nursing students. <br/><br/>As the season wears on, Violet, the Harmons' daughter, falls in love with a dead teenage boy, mother, Vivien Harmon (Connie Britton) is impregnated with some sort of demon-child, and father Ben (Dylan McDermott) is literally haunted by his past when the psychology student he cheated with pays him a visit and is killed on the premises. At this point we discover that everyone who dies in the murder home, stays in the murder home. <br/><br/>The best scary stories are ones where you don't have to delve too deep into the imagination to find the horror. Team Murphy and Falchuk get that and execute it beautifully in American Horror Story, as the true horror in the show lies not in the images of babies' limbs in jars or hanging bodies from chandeliers, but in the conflict between and within the characters. Vivien constantly struggles with trusting her cheating husband while Ben fights to keep his family together and resist the temptations of his seemingly attractive housemaid. Constance, played brilliantly by Jessica Lange, mistreats her special-needs adult daughter and murders her husband and his mistress when she catches them in the act. <br/><br/>There has been much talk about season two since the finale of the first. Unusual in television, the creators have decided on all new characters and an entirely new storyline in a different location. Given this, the show has been dubbed an anthology, versus a series. One thing the production team has decided to keep constant is Jessica Lange, as well as a few other actors from the first season.<br/><br/>Season two has been subtitled Asylum, and appropriately, will take place at an institution for the criminally insane. Given the meat and potatoes of the first season, I don't need to know any more than the place-setting for season two to tune in. But if isn't enough for you, Murphy and Falchuk have promised aliens, Nazis, and immoral nuns. And if Jessica Lange isn't a big enough name to pull you in, Adam Levine, Chloe Sevigny, Joseph Fiennes, and James Cromwell have also been billed. <br/><br/>American Horror Story: Asylum premieres on FX Wednesday, October 17th at 10 p.m. I first saw the show simply because some throw-away line at some forum or another and thought I'd give it a go - being low in shows to watch as we're in between seasons - and to be honest, when I started the first episode, I thought it was going to be a docu-drama.<br/><br/>Yeah, really wrong there, but I spotted reality momentarily (because I'm that great?). Anyways, the first 5 minutes went by, and I thought about turning it off and going back to my homework. They weren't good - manuscript was halting and the acting was on the weak side. I decided to let it roll, though.<br/><br/>And really, I haven't been so happy that I've given something a shot since I began watching Game of Thrones. With all the soap opera-ishness in series where I don't think it should be, all the insanely far out drama in drama series, and all the reality crap on TV most of the time, it's really refreshing to see this show.<br/><br/>Since those first few minutes I haven't been disappointed once, in fact, the storyline has really proved itself great and very engaging. (I really hope they can keep that up.) I think it's pretty innovative too - thinking on it, I really can't say I've seen any shows that has this shows great mix of mystery, horror, drama, and just a plain awesome plot.<br/><br/>I only have one problem now... I have to wait 4 days for the next episode, and after that, months for the new season. Cruelty. All I can say is WOW!! I am a life long horror fan and this is the best TV show ever in this genre! I cannot wait to watch the new episode every week. It is not overdone but not too weak. I love the shock factor, it is very unpredictable. I am so sick of horrors that you figure out within the first 5 minutes. So many story lines have been done to death. This show keeps you guessing and keeps shocking you week after week! It is not for everyone but if you are a horror fan, you have to love this show! It is not for the weak of heart or stomach! It is a psychological thriller and not just another slasher. The story is very well written and the way that it is shot just adds to the effect. It is not just another air brushed, smoothed over, politically correct show about the same old thing. I set my DVR to catch the first episode of this series. This series is more about masturbation and pornography than horror. It started out pretty interesting as they show boys exploring the house in 1978. But after the titles ran we are given a low budget porno. The horror stops dead in its tracks and the viewer is subjected to bondage, several butt shots of McDermott, two masturbation scenes, and rubber suit sex act. I was not surprised by the title poster. I am not that perverted. Some people have to watch porn and call it "horror".<br/><br/>Also I found the show debased the family the series. This is not how you make good horror movies. We are supposed to care about the characters, not wish they would all die horrible deaths. I see no future for this series as it appeals to base perversion and nothing else. Of course, then again, all those who continue to view it, could be easier to find should any children in their neighborhood go missing.<br/><br/>I have better things to do with my life than camping around the TV once a week to hear a good ghost story that turns out to be read by Larry Flynt. I used to love this show, but this last season is awkward. Truly sad about it. I just can't with AHS this season.... OK they exaggerate stories I get that, and it's fine. BUT completely making a new narrative for the Night Stalker.LAME. Just stop making this show ! I'm not going to write a review as such but artistically this show to me is what I like to watch - it's horrifying, weird and just completely compelling to watch. Obviously each season is different some being better than others but I love each season for the actors and actresses that make this show great. Jessica Lange was an amazing addition to this show even though she left after Freak Show. Of course my favourite is Evan Peters has been in every season. My personal favourites have been Murder House, Asylum, Coven and Hotel. I'll continue watching this no matter what direction they take it as I just love weird things I watched more than 4 hours of YouTube compilation but still the last 5 episodes of season 6 brought me puke,diarrhea,cancer and aids. The first season was OK for me the second one was amazing the third one was not my type but still good the fourth one was amazing the fifth was the worst of all and i thought it could not be worse! but here we are at season 6 it really felt like the whole team was trolling the audiences i no longer have any interest in the whole horror theme anymore after your extremely horrible season! season 2 made my nickname bloody face and it still is and it will be.but the fact that this amazing show turned out to be the worst season of any TV-show in my life brings the worst kind of sadness to me and i am going to give season 7 another chance but its going to be it last! I've seen the criticism of this season, and I understand it. The lack of logic, the pointlessness of killing off characters who then just pop back to life, and the fact it's not scary. Not scary at all.<br/><br/>That said, I've loved it and am distraught that this week sees the final episode air. It's been truly a joy watching Lange, Bassett and Bates firing off zingers at each other. And then there's Francis Conroy and her theremin. She probably had more fun this season than in the previous two combined - certainly she got all the best lines.<br/><br/>What does it have in common with "Murder House" & "Asylum"? A playfully chaotic story, characters who go from evil to sympathetic and back again in an eye blink, and all the surreal illogic of a fever dream. What's different? This time it's funnier and friendlier, with more than a nod to the soapy fun of "Valley of the Dolls" or "Dynasty" in its heyday. Don't get me wrong, there is horror - blood, gore, torture and mutilation - but that takes second place to the glamorous women, the hilarious dialogue and the rich New Orleans atmosphere.<br/><br/>I've seen some well-meaning but probably misguided attempts to deconstruct the show's take on feminism and civil rights. Go for it if you want, but probably the strongest feminist statement the show makes is in giving such great parts to so many terrific actresses, squeezing out the dudes. Even Danny Huston and Evan Peters are only peripheral to the action.<br/><br/>It may not have been as scary as season 1 or as out and out nuts as season 2, but this was campy, bitchy fun from start to end and I can't wait to see what season 4 brings. Let's hope that new additions Kathy Bates, Angela Bassett & Gabourey Sidibe are all coming back to hang out with Jessica Lange, Sarah Paulson and Lily Rabe again - but maybe that's too much to hope for.<br/><br/>In the meantime I know I'll never listen to Stevie Nicks in the same way ever again. Thanks, Ryan and Brad! I m very angry now. I just finished the season 1 finale, it felt really bad. I saw many comments saying that it kind of wraps up everything in a short time, but I gotta say, it's not wrapping anything up. There are still lots of questions going on and NOT that because the whole family is dead so the problem is solved!! <br/><br/>I cant believe that Hayden actually let Constance took away the baby, isn't he something that she has wanted for a long time? Hayden and Tate are angry staring at the Harmons family, is that mean they are planning to do something? The house is so "crowded", what will happen next with all the ghosts in that? What is wrong with the evil son? Is the death of the nanny meaning that he is going to be the next Tate? Or probably brings the end of the world? <br/><br/>I mean, as a horror fan, I m very impressed by the idea of such drama. It's original, gross, exciting and surprising. But I m a normal audience too. When I see an ending, I expect a real ending: Problems are solved, something surprising, everything goes back to normal probably. But what I see now is new problems coming up, nothing normal, suddenly the family turn into good-hearted ghosts? Come on, it's cliché. When it was finished, I was like: What? That's it? What the hell is going on? This drama is definitely worth rating over 6. But I m just too disappointed with the ending. I still recommend this to horror fans, if you are into freaky gross and twisted stories, this is the thing you are looking for. But don't expect any from the ending, it's awful. I've only watched the pilot so far, but got to start episode 2 right away. So, it's basic Horror material, three main characters with their own profile, clean on top but messy inside, move into a haunted house. You may expect suspense, some brutal violence, a bit of weird stuff and you'd kill for a good soundtrack that makes the sauce. So far, you'll get pretty much served. The cast is quite good and very efficient, I think having Connie Britton playing the mother does the trick: a real mid-life looking woman, without any particular desire to struggle against time effects—finally, someone without any facial surgery or heavy make-up. Evan Peters is really creepy in his role, the typical sociopath with high mental skills and urges to kill, with something more. There are a few "something more" in that show, don't miss it, the fact that each episode starts with a short flashback of other gruesome activities in the House through time, with its proper clichés that make the thing easy to aboard; the very neat editing combines to the fine soundtrack in very twisted "horror-action" sequences. The whole thing is quite Carpenteresque on its non-CGI setting and can be slightly Lynchian on the time line. Plus its a series, so every character gets its time on screen. I don't know if the rest of the series is doing good (yet) but be sure to take an hour to watch the pilot. Or you can skip to season 2, as it's been said that every season would have a new cast and story. That would prevent the thing to grow boring for too long. I must say this was a big surprise, thinking a TV horror show would not last long and fail, but this was very well written. It's very dark, it's twisted, interesting shockers at the end of each episode, and some great performances from Jessica Lange and Evan Peters. It kept me interested all throughout. This was a true horror genre compared to the mediocre slasher films that released today. Not only is it terrifying but very emotional as we get more background from the other characters.<br/><br/>My only problem was some of the plot holes during the course of the story and i found it confusing sometimes, i don't know that it's the fact that i'm one of the younger audience that don't quite understand some points of the story, but i think this is more for the older audience.<br/><br/>Other than that, American Horror Story is one of the most successful horror TV shows that keeps people interested. This is my first review but i felt i had to write something about this show.<br/><br/>Every minute of this show is creepy, it is so clever and thought through. Rather than making you jump in your seat every five minutes they managed to make you constantly on the edge not wanting to look away. The performance from everyone is outstanding, especially Jessica Lange who really sent shivers down my spine. She is by far the scariest character. Every episode reveals a secret you didn't know you were seeking and everything unfolds perfectly.<br/><br/>It looks like there is going to be a season 2 which i cannot wait to watch. However i kind of hope this is it because it would terrible if the show would just go on and on. Hopefully the writers can find new ways to build stories around this hunted house without repeating themselves. <br/><br/>For anyone who likes horror stories this show is a must, this is probably the best show since Twin Peaks American Horror is one of the best TV shows since Supernatural (Seasons 1-3 only). It's wonderfully creepy (the opening titles are fantastic) and has these great random moments of gore. I love Jessica Lange in this programme. She's done a wonderful job; she's convincing, natural and really makes the show good.<br/><br/>On the contrary, Connie Britton who plays Viv Harman is absolutely awful. She only has 4 reactions to anything: 1.) Dazed/confused, 2.) Angry, 3.) Stupid and 4.) Orgasmic. You will see her doing what I call her number 3 face to almost anything and everything – including moments where a normal person would cry, or at least show some negative emotion. What the hell was that tantrum in the Halloween episode?! That wasn't a tantrum, it looked like a 5 year old's hissy fit. The woman needs to move her face! It really annoys me as it's such a good script and she gets some fantastic lines.<br/><br/>Another great character is Kate Mara who plays Hayden.. She plays the perfect psycho love-struck little girl – great job! <br/><br/>Get rid of Connie Britton, and it'll be a perfect 10. I can't watch another season of a sexist white supremacist troll creates a cult because "wamen exist to make me sammich". Or powerful independent women witch destroys toxic male warlock clan who hate women because they are scared of how strong they are. I've never seen a show look at the world so purely in black and white. It makes everything so boring and predictable. Season 9 is amazing if you love movies like Friday the 13th, or any slasher produced in the 80's. What an amazing season. The best. Season 9 is unbelievable it is the best season of ahs nad truely awesome I absolutely loved 1984 and I don't get why it's getting so much hate. The acting was amazing and I loved the twists. I also think that this season had the best ending of all because it was so unexpected. I loveeed it! AHS isn't a simple horror show, it's something more. It's a refined mix of genres like horror, camp, gothic, pop, etc. AHS tells stories of "ghosts" that have populated the US past and that, despite the attempted removal, are still present among us. it is a powerful metaphor for telling the horrors of a nation. I think it's one of best series I've ever seen AHS used to be excellent, full of surprises. Now, in season 9, pretty much over-the-top junk. Soooooooo disappointed. Some seasons are great (Freak Show, Asylum) and some are not what I excepted... I still find myself addicted, despite some of the attempts to take it up another notch not coming off, I still commend the production team for making a show that still manages to keep my attention. Series one was strong, series two for me remains the high point, so slick, with great story lines, some that really make you want to look away. A must for horror fans, they've managed to keep a level of originality, and the jumping backwards and forth in time keeps you on your toes. It is always well acted, personally Jessica Lange, Angela Bassett and Evan Peters are the standout trio, I was dubious about Gaga, but she is very good. Zachary Quinto is very funny. It's not for everyone as a show, but so many horror serials lack quality acting, slick filming and great production quality, this show has it all. I have seen reviews recently complaining about the new season of American horror and I must say that I really don't get the need for the fuss yes the first episode did have election results but that's just life folks its everywhere and to me this season seems just as consistent to being scary and good as any other season I have seen has had I am keeping up as I am typing and watching it and I am jumping like crazy so just like any other season this isn't one to be overlooked or missed I really enjoyed seasons 1-4 and maybe 5, but season six was not on the chart. I am disappointed that the cast has taken a turn for the worst. Good luck in the future. In order to keep the same audience that has been enjoying the show from the beginning TV shows have to stop falling into political agendas. When they cast trouble makers in the show that is a game changer for a lot of viewers. We do not want to support such so called actors/actresses. I just finished the first episode and did not enjoy it. Every character in the first episode is annoying, most of the dialog just feels very unnatural and some of it is just absurd, and both these flaws are heavily boosted by the fast pace and abrupt cuts that really don't fit the genre imo. There is no sense of continuity, just one scene cuts into the next. I have absolutely no idea if the first episode tells the story of 2 days or 3 months of them living there. The horror scenes themselves are not bad. They also suffer from the bad cuts and fast pace, but they still manage to deliver atmosphere, but otherwise, this is really unwatchable for me. If I could rate it by season...here's how I would do it. (Keep in mind that horror is undoubtedly favorite genre)<br/><br/>Season 1: 10/10 stars<br/><br/>Season 2: 10/10 stars<br/><br/>Season 3: 6/10 stars<br/><br/>Season 4: 3/10 stars<br/><br/>Season 5: 8/10 stars<br/><br/>Season 6: 2/10 stars (Premiere ONLY) (I really hope it gets better because these found footage/documentary style horror attempts {in general} are getting tiresome to watch).<br/><br/>...And there ya go. Agree. Disagree. Whatever. Just don't say that Freakshow was your favorite or I'll lose my sh*t lol. ;) Season 1 is flucking amazing all the rest are flucking sheep, they should have done season 1 into a film and not bothered to bring the other seasons out, it's twisted as fluck and doesn't make sense. I don't see why they had to release another season after season 1 as season 1 is the best and it makes sense and it's flucking sheep, I feel you should make this into a movie and not just a TV series<br/><br/>I am speak under the freedom of speech act, Have a wonderful day.<br/><br/>I hope I do not hurt anyone's feeling nor do I cause an issue.<br/><br/>I feel that they should have just stuck with season 1.<br/><br/>Regards,<br/><br/>H AHS - Cult, is back at the high standard that this series was from the beginnings. Cult is an amazing mix of todays political atmosphere and mass psychosis from the 60s and 70s. The series contains many intelligent and absurd demagoguerie speeches. After 7 years of supportive roles Evan Peters is more than ready for the leading role in this season, and he does wonderful. There is always something very vulnerable about him, and it shows through even with the absolute leader of the cult. Evan makes you forget Lady Gaga. Sarah Paulson is amazing as always. She is one of the greatest TV actresses of all time. She is so dramatic that you almost think she has no real life, but then you see her smile at some party and you're relieved. <br/><br/>AHS has never been a thriller, it's so much better, it's pitch black comedy. Sometimes you have to close your eyes of what's going to happen, next time you laugh out loud. It's always very over the top, and that makes for great entertainment value. <br/><br/>American Horror Story is not your average horror. American Horror Story is deeply rooted in American culture and society. It criticizes and mocks institutions that once were, and still are, a vital part of society. Institutions that could make and break people. AHS pays attention to the victims of abuse of power, the underdog who's faith depends on the whims of the powerful. The actual horror in AHS has a sociological purpose, it's not mindless slash horror like in teen movies. Please be aware of this before you start watching this great show. <br/><br/>AHS - Freak Show, is probably one of my most favorite seasons so far. The story has a beautiful humane starting-point. A safe haven for deformed people. However, things go wrong, visualized in a unique game of exchanging deformity. Freak Show is also a masterpiece in styling. The makeup and costumes are in top notch 50s fashion. An absolute delight filmed in warm red colors. Freak Show has many references to the golden age of Hollywood, which was established by Europe's best cinematographers, mostly Jewish people who fled for the Nazis. Murder House - BRILLIANT Asylum - BRILLITAN Coven - BRILLIANT<br/><br/>Jessica Lang - BRILLIANT Sarah Paulson - BRILLIANT Frances Conroy - BRILLIANT Denis O'Hare - BRILLIANT <br/><br/>newcomers Taissa Farmiga - BRILLIANT Jamie Brewer - BRILLIANT Evan Peters - VERY PROMISING<br/><br/>I have seen lots of other anthologies (Friday the 13th,the series; tales from the dark side, Freddy's Nightmares) but NOTHING has ever got my attention like American Horror Story. The camera work alone elevates this particular anthology to excellence, as well as the spectacular choice of cast. This, the epitome of horror anthologies, is the best i have ever seen. Even with the fact that most anthologies were standard TV releases and this one is a Cable/Dish era release (we've come a long way in what we can show on TV). Not only did they have excellent stories - and the season-per-storyline is an excellent format - but as seen above, the actors are top notch and give a sense of quality within the show that other anthologies were missing. American Horror Story 2011 - Asylum<br/><br/>Showrunner/Producer Ryan Murphy controls much of what is written and released on AHS however there are many times key points are never resolved. <br/><br/>The 2nd installment: Asylum, was a collection of Horror, Insane people, the Catholic Church, Draconian practices coupled with the entrance of the Angel of Death and the Satan himself and a father/son serial killer named BLOODY FACE. Then there was the ALIENS which came in with a roar and went out with a whimper; never to be completely resolved and not only did they not make another appearance at the end of the story they never came back. For .5 seconds they were on screen with lead Jessica Lange but only when she was acting drunk. <br/><br/>Asylum was and still is the best of the 4 stories that have been presented through Murphy and after Lange leaves this year or even if she decides to stay for another 4 years the way these stories have been written have degenerated into tongue in cheek camp not worthy of it's stellar ensemble cast. I'm not entirely sure what people are expecting when they turn to a show called "American Horror Story". Evidently, they don't expect the title, because many are complaining about them using the same tropes as other horror films, of being disgusting, and some even say boring, or without any logic. What Ryan Murphy is attempting here is a push of the envelope show, to see what can become accepted on television today. There are explicit scenes in this show, but we, as a people, fear sex. We fear the odd, our emotions, our carnal nature, how close to our natural animal instinct we really are when pushed too far. This show explores this, and it utilizes all the older tropes to put together an interesting story. One thing I love about the series is how each season is self-contained. We don't have to force characters to bend to go with the rising fame and fan-insisted story lines for characters - we get new characters for the actors to play each season, which is very refreshing. Sara Paulson and Jessica Lange are by FAR my favorites on this show - thank god they've been in every season so far. If you don't want to explore the darker side to your human nature, don't watch this show, it doesn't hold back. How do I begin to review this title? How do the cast not only t portraits all the characters beautifully but also the characters from all 3 seasons( and hope many to come) believable.<br/><br/>It's a show that will keep you in suspense all the way. I absolutely adore the way the writers trick us into believing we know what is going to happen and that we are very good judges of the characters.<br/><br/>You never know how the characters will evolve and it leaves you wanting to know what is going to happen and to really look forward to the next episode.<br/><br/>I have to say I never for one second got bored of the show and I am thrilled to have discovered the show.<br/><br/>The characters are not divided in 2 categories as even the ones that ''look'' good can be twisted and even the bad ones can behave well.<br/><br/>I have to say at often Jessica Lange does still the show by throwing an remarkable performance for which she should be getting a reward.<br/><br/>Her characters make the viewer be crossed between in either wanting her to succeed with her plans or just fail them miserably.<br/><br/>I honestly can't decide whether to be on her side or not. In this show I love the fact that you don't have to pick a favorite because every characters will have something that you will hate or love about them.<br/><br/>I only gave it 8 out of 10 due to the ending on the second 2 The Asylum where Evan Peters characters disappears without any explication. I believe the second season left too many questions unanswered leaving the viewer disatisfied with the final result.<br/><br/>I am currently watching the third season and I can say that I am absolutely thrilled of what I am seeing. The episode with Halloween was good, both written and played and one of the reasons why I can't get enough of this show.<br/><br/>The structure of the cast and the writing are very well put together that they create this thrilling and fascinating show that will always keep you wanting more.<br/><br/>This is a MUST watch TV show that everyone needs to watch without any doubt. Dear FX, please be fearless and cancel this show and save the reputations of seasons 1-5. Murphy has become unhinged in his quest to gayify all his characters with mindless subplots. The fact that the Hollywood elite media adores him is reason enough to send this show packing. I'm assuming either the channels this is shown has so little else to show that it's compelled to keep ordering more episodes due to lack of choice.<br/><br/>If there's ever a case for trade descriptions abuse this is it! Apart from it being American and a story there's literally no horror in it whatsoever. It's just stylised dross with some not very weird characters thrown in for good measure. Think of Todd Browning's Freaks but without the freaks. Think Psycho without the psycho and this is essentially what American Horror Story is, just a story, and not a very good one at that!<br/><br/>My advice to the creators of this show is either take the word horror out of the title or go and see what horror genre actually entails as this show completely misses the mark! The worlds sick of hearing about the US president . Yaaaaawn OH gee, the tender hearts of republicans and democrats can't handle political elements used creatively at all. Yeah this has politics as a backdrop, but that's about it. It is used to define and provide an explanation to why the characters behave the way they do. So don't let these stupid people ruin this for you and give the new season a try. This season's theme is gore and psychological horrors (& phobias)and so far so good. CULT as the name says, this has a charming personality manipulating people in to following him and dance to his tunes by promising whatever validation the characters seek for. He lies and promises you anything to get you under his spell, be you are a black lesbian female democrat or a straight white hillbilly republican, he got what you want or so he says! If you haven't realized that by now and still feel offended by seeing it through your politicized kaleidoscopes, then this show is not for you.<br/><br/>If you could just read the reviews below me, you can see how both side blame the show for supporting the other side while putting their side in bad light, which only means it doesn't and they have peanut sized brains.<br/><br/>Although seeing the majority of the reviews made by right-ish people, are you guys sure its the liberals that get easily triggered over everything? I love when stuff like this shows true nature of people and the irony about them criticizing something while doing it themselves, good job on that AHS.<br/><br/>Seriously though, the season is amazing as long as you are mature enough to understand that politics is used as a build up for the plot and has nothing to do with your actual beliefs and stands. FX's "American Horror Story" is without a doubt a series that's entertaining in a wicked and odd way always keeping the viewer on the edge of their seats never knowing what to expect and "Glee" creator Ryan Murphy does it in such a sly sexy way try leather rubber suits! It's story is about a family and a house, yet it's not a normal family or a normal house. The family the Harmons Ben(Dylan McDermott)and Vivien(Connie Britton)have moved from the northeast to the west coast, sunny southern California and along with them and their young daughter Violet(Taissa Farmiga) they have secrets. Yet also the old L.A. mansion they move into has plenty of secrets and not all of them good. This house may be haunted by old murders. And on the side the Harmons are trying to deal with problems on the side, Ben(a psychiatrist)had a fling with one of his students on the side. And Vivien is still trying to overcome the delivery of a stillborn child.<br/><br/>This series is a lot of fright with scenes that are flashbacks and very sexy and creepy as it deals with funny faces and old babies. And interesting is the next door neighbor Constance(Jessica Lange)who as an old southern belle keeps things interesting with her nosey ways. Really this series is far out different and a look into how the past can haunt people it proves everyone and every place has a hidden past with hidden secrets. Overall "American Horror Story" is different yet it's a strange, fun, creepy, sexy, feel good weird time. I am completely in love with this show! The cast is to die for (no pun intended) and every character is quirky and flawed yet lovable in their own way. They introduce us to this inherently flawed and broken family of 3 who have come across country to start over but little do they know that they have moved into LA's "murder house"...a house that has more dark secrets than even their own family! Each week we learn as viewers more about the house and it's past inhabitants...and more so- each of their gruesome ends! <br/><br/>What I enjoy the most about this show is that every week you learn more about one particular character. You are able to see past the exterior and become very attached to them. And I love how off-beat it is. This may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I love the dark humor that's mixed in with the suspenseful spookiness of this show. It moves seamlessly between some terrifying concepts and eerie scenes and then back to macabre one-liners that help you to take a breath. <br/><br/>This is the most original show in ages! I usually HATE scary movies...I'm a wuss. However, I look forward to this show each and every Wednesday night! And truth be told, I usually end up watching each week's episode more than once just to catch all the little nuances that I may have missed during the first viewing. I can't wait to see how this show continues to unfold...and i'm incredibly curious as to how they are going to make this a long lasting series. Not because I don't believe in this show, I do 100%, but only because I'm hoping that they can pull this off! Well, where to begin? The Harmons move to a new home (at a bargain price) following traumatic events over the prior six months. Quickly we are introduced to a plethora of creepy and weird individuals, of varying life status, who have different intentions towards this family. There are gay men, kleptomaniacs and downs syndrome kids. And an abundance of naughtiness. THIS IS NOT FOR MINORS. It features masturbation twice in the pilot and lots of sexual references throughout. Also a bondage style sex scene is pivotal to the plot. This series has it all, murder, infidelity, insanity, abortion, blackmail.........need I go on...... It is very cleverly written and very in your face. If you appreciate a good homage to other horror flicks, keep your eyes open for subtle references. Currently we have a little more idea who is living and who is not, but there is still lots of stuff to learn and I am always left wishing it was next week for the next episode. Give it a whirl. It's like Marmite, you will either love it or hate it. I LOVE IT!!! I saw some of the reviews about it and I honestly think they missed the point here. The terror comes out not from the ghosts or the killings or the blood. It's true, they have gathered almost every clichÃ© to make this one. But somehow, all these seem to be just the background for the true horror story. And what would that be? I think, in time we will watch the tension between the Harmon family. Something like "The Amityville Horror" comes to mind. A domestic drama that will reach to a tragic finale. If u watch carefully the background of the house, u will find out that most of the murders that took place in it, were committed because of a sick domestic environment. And the Harmon family is getting there... Horrible series! Too much freakish sex and and not enough effective horror. What rare actual "horror" scenes it does include are more like a freak show than frightening. They're all generic, over-used tropes pulled from every other paranormal show or film ever done and they don't work at all.<br/><br/>There is no cohesive or even entertaining story. And the characters are irritating as hell so you don't give a damn what happens to them. In fact, I'd rather see them all die and go away.<br/><br/>And between the first two episodes, the gimp in the rubber suit and the naked guys whacking off, you can tell this was created by a guy who has a pure hatred for women. Of course, we all knew that from watching Nip/Tuck and Glee.<br/><br/>jk90 It's just so bored. The worst season ever, what about the final episode? It was just a really bad ending for a great show. Season 1, 2, & 3 are pretty good, Season 4 & 5 were ok, season 6 was just bad, then of course like Ryan Murphy's other shows he started shoving his personal political views in with Season 7 it was cringe-worthy and while many have said Murphy was trying to take a center point of view all it does is serve to victimize the left and make the right out as villains (clearly Murphy's idea is skewed as to what a "center view" is) Season 8 just kept going with this hard push of politics, trying to claim that women are marginalized so much that they have to kill men to rise to power. I haven't watched Season 9 yet but I doubt I am going to, I can't stand that Ryan Murphy thinks that shoving politics down our throats is ok just because his show is popular. It's wrong, it's dumb and it's sickening.<br/><br/>Watch Season 1-3 for sure, seasons 4 & 5 if you're just looking for something to watch. Ignore every other season unless you like a political message being crammed down your throat. Season 6, 'My Roanoake Nightmare', was marginally better than Season 3, 'Coven' (a very, very low bar), but still managed to be more tedious than Season 4, 'Freakshow'.<br/><br/>We are all waiting now for something the equal of the superb Season 5, 'Hotel' - we may possibly wait in vain, as they may never get it that together again.<br/><br/>So the score is taken as an average across the following components.<br/><br/>--- <br/><br/>Season 1 (retrospectively named 'Murder House') <br/><br/>7 / 10 <br/><br/>It was a bit of an incoherent mess but it was new and exciting, and engrossing enough to be enjoyable.<br/><br/>--- <br/><br/>Season 2 'Asylum' <br/><br/>8 / 10 <br/><br/>A TOTAL mess! But the performances and atmosphere were so awesome it was impossible not be be absorbed! <br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Season 3 'Coven' <br/><br/>0 / 10 <br/><br/>An absolute, abject write-off. Just embarrassing, and not even the great Ms Lange or amazing Ms Bates could save it. After 'Asylum' it was just a bitter, stinging disappointment and a slap in the face to the fans. This season should never have made it to transmission.<br/><br/>--- <br/><br/>Season 4 'Freakshow' <br/><br/>4 / 10 <br/><br/>Had all the ingredients and a universe of potential, as well as probably the best opening titles sequence AHS has ever had. It squandered pretty much all of it and just managed to bore the viewer into seeking their thrills elsewhere. It should have had a complete re-write before filming began, as it could have been a masterpiece.<br/><br/>--- <br/><br/>Season 5 'Hotel' <br/><br/>10 / 10 <br/><br/>The masterpiece we were all waiting for. Easily the best season of AHS ever and the one that has truly, finally, put it on the map. 'Hotel' is now the new bar, the one they have to aspire to in all future efforts - <br/><br/>--- <br/><br/>Season 6 'My Roanoake Nightmare'<br/><br/>1 / 10 <br/><br/><ul><li>which makes it such a shame that this is all they managed to come up with. Boring, utterly un-engaging, and overly complicated but without being particularly clever. It wanted to make you *think* it was clever, but didn't actually include the necessary smarts. Even the implied fourth-wall-breaking was done clumsily and without much evident planning.</li></ul><br/><br/>--- <br/><br/>And so we reach an average of: <br/><br/>5 / 10 <br/><br/>AHS is overall not that great, but its few great moments *are* enough to keep an audience, including this reviewer, coming back to check it out.<br/><br/>- <br/><br/>-- <br/><br/>--- American Horror Story is one of the most wicked television shows and probably the best horror show to date. Every season is completely different from the others, so American Horror Story fans will never get bored watching it. Every season mostly has the same actors as the other seasons, but they play a different character in every season, which is fun to watch because you see the actors playing somebody completely different than before. The show itself is extremely well written; every episode has got it's twists and you'll never know what happens next.<br/><br/>The acting is also great: Jessica Lange is by far the most talented actress of the series, but also the acting of young stars like Taissa Farmiga and Jamie Brewer is good. <br/><br/>The show is the perfect combination of an addicting series with a well-written script and gory horror. I recommend it to everyone. I firstly want to start off by talking about the series as a whole. Every episode, for me, answered at least one question and asked another one, which was something great that made the series a whole lot more fresh, I have some issues with the way certain characters were brought across and the way some story lines were handled, but those issues are few and far between, that they're semi irrelevant. <br/><br/>Now, let's get to the ending of the first season. (Which includes about a 5 minute piece from Jessica Lange, which is absolutely wonderful. I'd say she's deserving of the Emmy from this scene alone.) A twist that will go down in the books and will arguably go down as one of the best final scenes in the history of Television. If you haven't got to that part yet, I won't spoil exactly what happens, but the scene is truly fantastic. I don't know how else to describe it without giving anything away, but I am truly surprised that Ryan Murphy was able to come up with a twist like this. <br/><br/>The cast. I think the show truly does owe the success of this season to 8 people. Alexandra Breckenridge, Jessica Lange, Evan Peters, Lily Rabe, Kate Mara, Connie Britton, Francis Conroy and Tarissa Farmiga. (You might notice that the only male's name that I put here was Evan... Now look at how many males were in the lead/supporting cast. Exactly.) Each of these 8 delivered wonderful performances and put the show in a league of it's own when it comes to displaying acting prowess. <br/><br/>I want to give a special mention to 4 of those people. Kate, Jessica, Francis and Lily. Kate delivered a genius performance as the extremely troubled product of Ben (Dylan McDermott)'s fidelity. I believe she hit absolutely every note that was expected of her and gave us something extremely creepy and chilling which is what I believe that performance was supposed to be. <br/><br/>Jessica Lange delivered a fantastic performance as the southern, very evil Constance Langdon. From beginning to end, some of the best performances on the show came from her. I was worried when watching the pilot that this role would only be very much supporting, or at the most, recurring. I was happily surprised to figure out that Constance was one of 3 leads. (Arguably, of course, considering where you'd place the characters of Peters and Farmiga.) Jessica definitely deserved that Golden Globe and will deserve the Emmy she will receive. (I'm calling it now.) I hope she does agree to stick around for Season 2, because I would gratefully view her amazing performance again. <br/><br/>Lily Rabe delivers a striking and underrated performance as Nora Montgomery, who, in the long run, just wants a child. I can't spoil much of the performance she delivers, as it does spoil the story a little bit. With the story of her and Charles taking up the majority of Flashback time, I think she delivered what she needed to and even more and did a fantastic job. I love her accent, as well. <br/><br/>Francis Conroy. I absolutely loved (And love her) in Six Feet Under, so it was no surprise when she completely shocked me playing the role of Moira. Delivered a wonderful performance and had some of the best moments in the show. In the finale, I felt my heart warm because of the moments she had with Vivien (Connie Britton). <br/><br/>Overall, the show is wonderful and anyone who hasn't already seen it should go watch it! For the performances and for the story. I give it an 8, because I felt some of the performances were lacking. (McDermott, ala the first few episodes, in particular.) And the story felt a little bit too far fetched for what it was, at a few points. Very good, solid new show. I'm keeping this simple. It's creepy. Really.... Creepy! Some other reviews have called this show boring and predictable. It's anything but. What the hell are these people on? This is class horror - 2nd only to The Walking Dead. Yes, Jessica Lange IS over the top . She's meant to be! She's a self-obsessed lunatic in a hell of her own. The suspense builds up week after week, giving you just enough information to keep you guessing and looking forward to the next episode. As for not caring for any of the characters - come on, the only people you really have to care about is the unfortunate couple who have bought the house. I've just watched episode 10 and all the pieces are coming together and I still don't know how it's gonna end! Nothing predictable here! This show has to continue for many more seasons. This is what any horror TV should aspire to. In fact, it's more of a mini-movie every week! Please don't be put off by the bad reviews - this is excellent. Watch it late. Then try to sleep...if you can. 10/10 American Horror Story is one of the best shows I've ever seen. The acting is top notch, thanks to Connie Britton and Jessica Lange (especially the latter.) If this show was just Jessica Lange, it would still be a great show. Her character, Constance, is one of the best on the show, and she's the best actress on television.<br/><br/>Every single character has an amazing story, and the show actually makes you feel bad for people who have done horrible things. I don't really mind, but take it as you will.<br/><br/>The show is effectively creepy, but the whole dead babies thing is a little overdone, especially since you get two minutes of it at the beginning of every episode.<br/><br/>If you've ever even thought about watching this show, then watch. You'll instantly fall in love. American Horror Story is simply extraordinary.<br/><br/>A trip deeply filled with psychedelic visuals, interesting characters, a solid musical score, along with superb acting. This show will leave your mind in a puddle of mush, it's psychological ramifications are it's strong suit.<br/><br/>Terror. Fear. Emotions. American Horror Story takes those vibes and bends the thin line between fantasy and reality. It's edgy grittiness and sharp bladed approach appeal to us deeply. It's the dagger, and our brains are the victim. Unrelenting surprises unlock themselves as you delve deeper into the realm of insanity.<br/><br/>Just sit back relax open your mind and enjoy the brilliance. I loved season Nine. It was such a great ride. The 80's brought some of the best horror movies, a mix from horror to light humor. Season nine I think gave that great flavor in that regards. Twists and turns. It was a great ride. It didn't pretend to be something which it wasn't. If you love horrors from the 80's, you'll love this season. I thought is was a fun ride. Not scary, but fun, dwelling into that horror turn of events from a everyday life filled with twists and turns into unpredictable outcomes. For me my favorite season. Enjoy. Ok what I don't understand, if the killer escaped the mental institution, would the camp not be the first place they would look. Again I just don't get it. Its always been a show under written , easy to follow , filled with tons and tons of gore , violence , profanity and sex. That add zero nor expand the scene or story in anyway. Just there for to fill the cheap seat like most shows an movies do. I love that they made this show about nothing but over the top brutal murders and humans at there worst. An Guess What Its Popular..... Thats Disturbing When you look at how little people already care about each other an for some reason dont have the ability to separate reality and fiction or need little excuse to act insane...... So i really think ill written , pure murder shows are a genre we dont need right now if ever....So many creative paths to make the world happier , deeper thinking , motivated , inspired , use there imagination for more then watching people get murdered hour after hour ( pretty twisted if you think about it) Ready for this show to be canned , can tell its close cause only the worst of the cast remains. The Blonde , Is beyond off putting in every single season , That would of made the show 70 percent better right there , she is an awful actress that only has 2 dynamics , consistently unlikable and always foul.... ugh. not emma roberts the one that always has the bland mean look always. Evan Peters ... James March And
Sarah Paulson arent in the latest mess of a show. Which good riddons as sarah and james both very hard to watch for more then 1 minute at a time...... So many options so much money and actors available an they chose some of the most annoying to use in every season...... Just like the idea of the show it self, a waste...... Disappointing. If you like watching people getting brutally murdered , loads of violence , an pure vulgarity for the sake of vulgarity and (arent) looking for a horror show or creative concepts.... Then this show is for you! The first couple of season six are a must see, but every season after slowly declines into a disappointing pool of bad acting and loose plots. With series like this and Breaking Bad, you have to wonder why so many people say that a piece of trash like Once upon a time is the best series on TV of the last decade.<br/><br/>AHS reminds me of Twin Peaks, leaving a feeling of uneasiness after watching, with twisted scenes and imagery. OK, contrary to Lynch's, this series was made for the average intelligent audience to be understood.<br/><br/>I'm so glad to have found a series that separates so much from the Twilight saga vibe that permeates motion pictures lately. This is a drama for adults. Period.<br/><br/>Excellent acting as well, even from the younger actresses/actors.<br/><br/>Kudos!<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Edit for season 5: So, they basically replaced the actress in the role of diva reserved for Jessica Lange in the previous series for that... thing, that mockery of a singer with a stupid name, that ugly (mentally, although she certainly is in other ways) person... I kid you not: I felt physically nauseated to see her body in the first episode. Humungous BOO!! to whoever decided to include her in AHS. It's not enough to know of the existence of such horrendous, self-serving being, now they have to inject it directly into your eyes, as well. I'm removing my positive score, for it. Let's speak with candidness and honesty; aliens always seem a bit far-fetched. However, in season two of American Horror Story, known as Asylum, serial killers, exorcisms, hauntings, mad scientists, insane asylums, monsters, AND aliens are all pieced together to construct hooking horror television show. <br/><br/>The season opens with an abandoned mental institution and a couple who has set off to explore it. As they enter its walls, the setting reverts back to 1964, and the story begins with a female reporter, Lana Winters, who is attempting to expose Briarcliff Mental Institution, a home for the criminally insane, of its corruption. In the process, she comes to discover a new serial killer that is being housed there as he awaits trial. When Winters is denied the story by a nun that is running the institution, Winters trespasses on to the property. Discovered by the despotic head-nun, Sister Jude, Lana Winters is blackmailed, punished, and committed to the asylum for her homosexuality. Behind Briarcliff Mental Institution's closed doors, all sanity is left as you embark on a twisting journey, with an ever-thickening plot, in to the despairing depths of crazy. <br/><br/>Created and produced by Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk, American Horror Story: Asylum is one season in an anthological series that takes place in various locations. Each season has its own unrelated plot, characters, and horrors. First airing on FX in October 2011, American Horror Story: Haunted House delivered the series concept, and left viewers wanting more, as the biggest new cable series of 2011. Answering wishes, American Horror Story: Asylum began in October 2012 and aired its last episode on January 23. With 35 series award nominations and eight awards, clues to season three are being revealed and excitement is building, after a somewhat surprising ending to the spook-filled season. <br/><br/>In watching American Horror Story: Asylum, the detailed plot is not only an attention 'getter,' but 'keeper' as well. Opening with a horror-packed episode, the series is sure to capture an audience. With each new episode, the characters' lives are revealed, giving the viewer insights in to those that are sane, insane, and destined for the asylum. One of the highlights of the season is Jessica Lange's portrayal of Judy Martin, also known as Sister Jude. As you see her character intensify, so does Lange's acting ability. Her role hits a character turning point when she is committed to the asylum, and the viewer must feel Sister Jude's agony as she is abandoned and left to handle the horrors herself. The deconstruction she faces leaves the viewer wondering how far writers Murphy and Falchuk are willing to retreat in to the complexities of darkness. The casting of each of the characters was done flawlessly, as each story elicits different fears and emotions. <br/><br/>Another credit to the creators is their ability to write and face controversial issues. From homosexuality, to inter-racial marriages, religion to the American Health Care System, American Horror Story: Asylum is bursting with divisive material, and yet it is ultimately what makes the show so captivating to watch. No matter is too provocative and no issue is too scandalous. There is brilliance to be found in the complexities of controversy. However, one issue seemingly kept the show from achieving perfection. <br/><br/>Despite the comprehensive plot, the story did seem to resolve too soon. Although all loose ends were neatly packaged, the show's ending seemed rushed. Due to the content, the series has an air of endlessness, and sadly it seems to culminate while the characters are still developing. Regardless, it is clothed in genius and opens viewers to a new and upcoming anthological horror genre. <br/><br/>Due to some of the content, it is definitely recommended for a mature audience who seeks drama, scandal, horror, and an all-inclusive journey every week. Season three is anxiously awaited. First thing you'll notice about this show is its theme music. It might not make much sense until you've seen an entire episode. Then it makes perfect sense. The acting is good - the characters seem to work well together. Some of it can be easy to figure out, but most of it isn't. The characters are written very well and acted. The wife can be sweet and then minutes later, go a little psycho. You can feel for the dad at times, but mostly you just wonder "what are you thinking?!" And that's what makes it so much fun to watch. Just ensure that you keep youngsters from many of the episodes - it's for adults. A great show during the first season. Season 2 will be very different. I'm not sure it will work, but I'll definitely tune in to see! First to say, after seven episodes, there are certain things revealed in every episode, so, missing one episode means missing some important information. To be full aware about what's going on, one has to watch every episode.<br/><br/>Second thing is, there are actors which are worth alone watching the show, first of all, great Jessica Lange as the sinister neighbor, then Frances Conroy and Alexandra Breckenridge as both the young housekeeper, and Evan Peters as the Psychopath. While Connie Britton is believable in her role, I found in Dylan McDermott the most weak gear of the wheelwork, as I couldn't imagine him as a therapist. That is, because he has not the slightest intellectual facet. How to portrait a therapist, both the actor and the writers missed in not watching Lars von Trier's 'Antichrist'. Zachary Quinto's cameo as a gay former owner of the house is memorable. Obviously he has a lot of fun with his character, and although he's a bit overacting - that maybe intentionally if you know the facts - , he brings in quite a bit of (needed) humor.<br/><br/>Third, yes the show is more than mildly swamped with clichés, which could be avoided. First and most annoying cliché is the cheating/lying husband and the deeply hurt wife together with the devastated dream of a family. The second uninspired cliché is the daughter. She has a few depression habits, like autotomy or 'being different' at high grade, but apart from this, she is a blank paper, and nobody knows, why. Watching the great 'Dead like me' would have given the producers a good idea how 'strange' daughters could be presented to the audience. Although, why she is in the middle of the horror, is partially revealed until now, but not fully satisfying. Maybe there's more to come. - The last cliché I didn't like was the mad scientist's, who was the builder of the house, and who did some horrible, nonetheless a bit ridiculous things I will not spoil here.<br/><br/>There is a bit of a modern approach to our daily sexuality, and it's clear that those three or four mild scenes would gain the Puritans' attention. Let me assure you that you don't have to take them serious. 'American Horror story' is very harmless compared to 'True Blood' or 'Hung'. Fact is, people have intercourse and are masturbating. People have sexual fantasies. If one can't live with those facts, he (or she) shouldn't watch modern shows. <br/><br/>What I appreciated is, that the 'Horror' - as mentioned in the Show's title - is not a real horror to the audience. It's more a slight drifting, where horror meets reality and becomes a part of a daily life. If I compare this show to Japenese Horror movies, it's like a Coke compared with heavy red wine. But a show with continuous Japenese-like horror masterwork is a task not easy to fulfill. The nearest western approach I know is Lars von Trier's 'Geister' (Ghosts) with some restrictions. The ultimate horror story is still out there waiting for a brave producer and a genius writer team.<br/><br/>Overall, I appreciate that someone produces a show like this. It's a big risk, given the high production value through the cast alone. The biggest danger for us watching the show is to be disappointed with the revelations and the forthcoming. That it would have in common with 'Twin Peaks'. Speaking of, of course this show is nothing like 'Twin Peaks', except of keeping multiple mysteries and showing strange people. And, to be honest, I am quite relieved about that. Seasons 1 to 5 were riveting!<br/><br/>I gave them a 9-star rate!<br/><br/>Then S6 was no where near the quality (5 stars), and S7 was identity politics and agenda driven garbage. New, bad writers? Directors? ...We get enough of that on nightly news, why do so many series and movies purposely alienate ~half the audience by doing this?!<br/><br/>Down to 3 stars now, holding my nose as I start S8 binge watch... I hope it gets better and I can upgrade the score, again. First season was amazing. next two were good. then i started rating shows:<br/><br/>Season 4: 1/10
i had to force myself to finish this season. it was horrendous (1 viewing)<br/><br/>Season 5: 1/10
i quit a few episodes in. i quit the show Season 1 of American Horror Story was absolutely fantastic. It was the perfect mix of horror, drama, suspense, and even dark comedy. Though the plot come slowly at first and was confusing at times, it hooked me. The confusing nature of the show adds to the addicting factor of the show. The more confusing it got with it's genius plot twists and turns the more I wanted to watch it. I loved everything about the first season, it illustrated perfectly a modern haunted house story.<br/><br/>Then came season 2.<br/><br/>Oh man... Season 2. 'Asylum' This season is a whole new monster to reckoned with. It blows everything that season 1 did out of the water. You think that what Tate did to the Harmon's was crazy? Well wait till meet some of the staff at Briarcliff. This season is so much more twisted and dark that I actually find myself getting somewhat scared watching certain episodes.<br/><br/>'Asylum' is even better than 'Murder House'. On a plot level, it feels much more original. 'Murder House' felt like a send-up of all the classic haunted house/ghost movies. While this one is completely different all it's own. Never have I seen a horror movie that packs in serial killers, Nazis, demonic possession, mad doctors, and better yet... the implication of alien invasion. I find myself thinking "am I insane!?" while I watch the show. The acting is up to par with 'Murder House' namely Sarah Paulson, Lily Rabe, Zachary Qunito, and of course the fantastic Jessica Lange.<br/><br/>Not only is the acting this season just fantastic, so is the spectacle. The sets of this asylum are dark, dreary, grim, and creepy. Even the costumes are so spot on for 1964. The editing may be weird, but it's supposed to be, it's of putting and makes the audience feel on edge. The cinematography is even better this season. The show feels so cinematic that I forget I'm watching a TV show.<br/><br/>I know we're not even half-way through this season yet, but I find myself dreading waiting a whole week for the next episode. I don't even know where the next episode is going to take us, but I truly cannot wait to see how this season ends up. Because so far, it's near-perfect. Last season of American horror story was okay, but nothing compared this season. They have really step it up some notches, and each episode just leaves you wanting more. I saw a comment that said this season gives you the story and detail of AMC's Walking Dead. I think it comes pretty darn close. This show is weird, sick, and twisted and every way you can possibly imagine. They are not holding back with the vivid imaging and isn't sparing any audience by watering down horror scenes, which is pretty good considering that it's rated MA. Overall the show gets a 10/10, and they must keep it rolling for future audiences to get hooked on as well. American Horror Story is the best show if seen in years.<br/><br/>I'm tired of watching Vampires and werewolves, CSI cops with Technology that don't exist or cold case who done its. Original and in a class of its own. The suspense and dark atmosphere I was drawn into was awesome and just wished with every passing episode that the creators will only stick to one epic season before the suspense wears off. Being a horror movie fan you think you have seen it all and The American Horror Story was a breath of fresh air. I can see that people that don't like horror movies would not like this series but that doesn't make it a bad one either. As much as I love show I hope the next season will be the finale and creator Quit while their ahead. And to all the haters watch the whole season before making your final decision. Honestly, I have yet to see a TV Series or a movie that could, at least, startle me. This one does. It's great, not only because of the special effects and the plots, but also because it has a lot of plot twists that keep you hooked till the end. I loved the 8th season and the way the writers managed to include some of the previous seasons in one. I loved the plot twist at the end. Season 9, which depicts a rather mundane horror movie plot - some young adults going at a camp (Camp Redwood), which is known for being the scene of a mass murder from some years back - has a few twists and turns that make it different from the usual movies. The only season I liked less than the others was Freak Show, but it was still better than what I usually see on the TV.
If you like horror movies, or thrillers, and don't mind seeing a lot of killings, give it a try! Best to worst seasons (RANKED)<br/><br/>-Asylum (Scary, intelligent, and good acting) 8.6
-Cult (Smart, Political, sometimes eerie) 8.4
-Murderhouse (Good acting, pretty good) 8.2
-1984 (Fun, creepy and heartwarming) 7.9
-Coven (Pretty fun at some points, entertaining) 7.4
-Freakshow (Bizarre, interesting but sometimes too extra) 6.4
-Apocolypse ( I guess its fine, but forgettable season due to messy plot) 6.0
-Roanoke ( Good ideas and concept but executed very poorly after the first episode.) 5.6
-Hotel (Stupid, weird, too extra) 5.3 Yeah its not scary at all, not on season was even slightly horror and the writing is trash except for the first 2/3 of season 2. im just saying dont expect horror and its very political which I dont mind but I feel like the show is just a platform for that and the writer dont care about horror or a cohesive plot and it sucks. also season 1 and 5 are the same thing. oh and the young nun for season 2 is hot I'm going to write only about the American Horror Story-Apocalypse. The first impression was like : Wow! - It's the eternal story they're talking about ,the epic fight between light and darkness,with lots of souls wasted and huge blood waves spilled.For a horror genre fan,sounded real good.So,I watched it. A fight between Warlocks and Witches.Really? The son of the ancient snake,the hell bringer looked like a pretty face dumb psycho spoiled moron wearing leather clothes.The good girls looked like some witches escaped from Hogwarts after a Voldemort's raid. Anyways,the series have some cool parts,it wasn't boring if you accept the holes in the script and the story lines given. The end of the story was poor.The horror with a happy end.They used last five minutes of the show trying to explain that the darkness will start the war over again with another six six six boy.Something like The Apocalypse reloaded.It won't do. Was enjoying this season until it became a Coven reboot with overbearing misandry, every male apart from one in this season are portrayed as either gay or as a horrific misogynistic. There were enough excellent scenes and awesome acting to keep me watching to the end but could have been more balanced Don't believe everything you read , the 7th season was one of my favs. I loved it It appears, and I agree to some extent, that the obvious references to Tr**p's divisiveness would be upsetting to some especially since this series is suppose to be entertaining fantasy, and not politicized social commentary. The writer's could have been "meaner" to the boss by referencing his avoidance of Viet Nam service w/plantar fasciitis (difficult to verify, mostly subject self-reporting; I've had it twice & about all it does is bother you when you first wake up then you can run miles or play bball for hours - no problem), or his tax avoidance, or his dad bankrolling his retail land flipping, or his treatment of much much younger females. So the central plot theme was his emboldening the far active right to act upon their beliefs by mobilizing our innate fears and changing the political future. It was not an accident that "clowns" were chosen as the fear carriers. Another, related, politicized theme was female degradation, and whether they "can win an argument w/their husband"; "won't be catcalled"; "bosses won't talk about their tits"; "women can't lead"; "can be outsmarted & out muscled"; "should do is shut up"; "know their place & make a goddamn sandwich". Since the first episode, I am a big fan of this series. I really love the acting, the performance and the outstanding story telling of that series.<br/><br/>In my personal ranking, I consider Asylum and Roanoke to be the best two seasons due to their epic background and the setting. They are directly followed by Murder House, Freak Show and Coven, although that might actually change after the current season Apocalypse, since there seems to be a twist in the plot of those other episodes...<br/><br/>Cult was an outstanding masterpiece in performance and story, and as some here already pointed out, not a real Horror Story, but a superb part of the American culture, so definitely a part of it. Not the best, though.<br/><br/>Hotel had some great performing, but a great story crippled due to overambitious packing of side stories that made the whole package almost unbearable. I feared that the whole series might have suffered under this, but thanks to the limited links to other series, this was - hopefully - a unique event. Although I have to admit Lady Gaga showed potential. I've seen a lot of horror movies and this is no run of the mill horror series. I've only seen one season, and I'm hooked. The series is a different plot each season, so I don't know what the rest is like, but I'll say this... the show is less scary than it is compelling. It's more about the people that are dead or alive with unresolved conflict. It touches on grief, pain, and resolution. The acting is great, the plot is well written, and the twists are compelling even if sometimes predictable. <br/><br/> It's not perfect, but I gave it a10 because I loved it. Let me know what you thought. ... and that is not in any good way. I am not sure what has happened to this show and the appeal people see in it anymore. To be blunt, The only episodes worth watching are the first 6 episodes and I do not mean first 6 episodes of this season or the last I mean the series. Yes, the first 6 episodes of the entire series ever made; Season 1 episodes 1 - 6, after that it's all gone to s**t. The plots are always good. Actually it is the idea behind the plot that I think is really good but it is the execution of it that sucks. Maybe it is the writers or the producers or the directors, heck maybe it is everyone except for the person who came up with the idea that are just bad at what they do. I am a fellow human being who is giving you the sincere advice to avoid this creation like the plague, because I can guarantee you that your time is more precious than this. As usual, it was no surprise that I found myself in love with every detail of the amazing story. Although I have to admit that this season had a little more darkish background plus Jessica Lange was nowhere in the mixture so, I thought that I wouldn't like it as much as the previous seasons. But the cast was more than great including of course the surprisingly amazing Lady gaga, they made it hard to miss Jessica. Gaga was born to play the part of the countess, it suited her perfectly. The whole cast was amazing with their overwhelming performance from Evan Peters, Sarah Paulson, Denis O'Hare, Kathy Bates, Angela Bassett and many more. The storyline of this season was unique and interesting, and the set was absolutely beautiful and completes the image. I liked how this season had a connection with the previous seasons. The ending of this season was not expected and slightly sad but not disappointing yet, I thought more would happen and not ending it with almost everyone is dead. I loved and already missing this season, Ryan Murphy always creates a masterpiece and I can't wait for the next season. Creators Brad Falchuk and Ryan Murphy return to the AHS saga, moving the gang of unique characters into the period Hotel Cortez (very cool location and set-styling). Minus Jessica Lang (at this point), many series favorites (Sarah Paulson, Kathy Bates, Angela Basset, Evan Peters, and Denis O'Hare - bound this year for Emmy Nomination for his "Liz Taylor" character) return, add in Lady Gaga as "The Countess," sexy Cheyenne Jackson (Magic Mike) and new lead Wes Bentley (Interstellar). If not for the final ten minutes of "Hotel," I would have deleted the series (I left "Cove" and "Freak Show" after two episodes), knowing at least I got a glimpse of Gaga's "acting" debut. However, if the last ten minutes of the AHS:Hotel season premiere are any indication of the mystery, intrigue, sex, sickness and fun horror to follow, I'm in. The AHS series is a strange venture, with a history of starting strong and fading fast. Time will tell if the "Hotel" can stay open and sustain visitors. Review of MURDER HOUSE: <br/><br/>So, I'd heard a lot about this American Horror Story but never got around watching it until now. My feelings on the show are mixed; it seems to be an incessantly hyped TV show but one that's rather undeserving of that hype. The story, in a nutshell, is about an ordinary American family - each member of which has their own secrets - moving into a house with a haunted history. The house is full of ghosts, many of whom plan to interact with the present...<br/><br/>Let's be fair: this is a ridiculous show. In the need to constantly shock and surprise the viewer, the amount of twists that play out becomes silly. The narrative is complex, skipping all over the place in terms of time frame, but remains easily understandable for viewers. One of the problems with this is that there are no likable characters here; the closest we get is Dylan McDermott's and he's hardly a shining beacon. Characters like the wife and daughter are irritating beyond belief, although Jessica Lang is very good as an old-fashioned Southern belle.<br/><br/>Many of the story lines reference other horror films and music from the likes of PSYCHO and BRAM STOKER'S Dracula is used throughout, which is a little odd. Still, MURDER HOUSE is fast-paced, I'll give it that, and there's never a slow moment in any of the episodes; it keeps you watching too. If I notice the next series show up on TV I'll view it, although it's not something I'd be keen on buying; this sort of programme has virtually zero rewatchability. Season 1 Haunted House - This was a strong start for the show with a story about a haunted house. Its definitely cliché but its surprisingly psychological and can be scary to some. Pros: A really fresh start for the show. Strong Cast especially Jessica Lange's Character. Horror elements that make the show worth binge watching. Entertaining and never really slow. Cons: A bit cliché once and awhile. Confusing and unexplained at times.<br/><br/>Overall Grade - 8.5/10 & A- <br/><br/>Season 2 Asylum - Hands down the best season. This season was the most intriguing, more better theme, and contained even more intriguing characters. Pros: Improvement from Season 1. Acting has been an improvement. Intriguing story every episode. The season is never slow. A very unique and interesting theme line. Cons - The show feels like it should be more horror-like and more scary. It turns into a drama a lot of the times like were almost not watching something horror.<br/><br/>Overall Grade - 10/10 & A<br/><br/>Season 3 Coven - I was very disappointed in this season. It was a huge drop down from Season 2. It does have some entertaining elements and good plot points, but it felt too boring throughout the season.<br/><br/>Pros - Some more great performances. The themes in this season are really great and meaningful. Cons - Very slow. Some episodes wasted and are quite boring. The horror element to the story drops even more. A huge down drop from season 3.<br/><br/>Overall Grade - 7/10 & B-<br/><br/>Overall Show Grade - 9/10 & A- FX's "American Horror Story" does it's job in the entertainment industry phenomenally. First off, let me start by saying that because of the reoccurring actors and actresses throughout different seasons despite having different story lines truly helps us appreciate the cast due to the diversity and differences in their characters. All of my gratitude goes towards the marvelous actors! "American Horror Story" can be viewed as more of a psychological horror as it ventures into the question of the humans capacity for evil. (While watching it you still might scream though.) The story lines to all of the seasons so far are riveting. Something new always comes up and it truly keeps you on the edge of your seat. The characters are deep and interesting; they are very connective and emotionally attachable. You'll easily find yourself crying or screaming inside your head if a tragedy comes your way. "American Horror Story" is a puzzler; it makes you think about life, death, happiness, family, and the biggest yet smallest question of all, "Why?" This review will take apart the different seasons and add my opinion. the show is sadly getting worse but I remain hopeful for hotel<br/><br/>murder house- murder house is a fantastic take on the haunted house genre. This season uses classic horror film scores to add to its creepy atmosphere <br/><br/>Asylum- asylum gives us a look at the horrible conditions in this strange asylum.in my opinion this is better than murder house<br/><br/>coven -Coven is the beginning of the end of the good horror show that is American horror story. I did not hate this season but it wasn't the best<br/><br/>freak show -I made a BIG MISTAKE watching freak show . enough said At first I didn't care for the show but it grew on me. Everyone will say season 1 / 2 are the best. I didn't care for season 1 too much. I showed it to a few friends and they surprisingly all liked it. I did get into it near the end but season 2 was 10x better. Loved when the man was Santa, the special effects. The story was much better than the old as time boy meets girl story. Jessica Lange had a much better role and the ending of season 2 you go from hating someone (sister Jude) to feeling sad about her. It's great they use the same/similar actors in this series as well. and before I forget for season 2 bloody face and the opening were excellently done where you don't expect any of it.<br/><br/>Season 3 - the witches season was their worst. They had an amazing concept but it was as if the writers got too head strong or felt they were untouchable. Liked the voodoo aspect. Some cool 3d effects but they were running out of ideas. The supreme witch thing was annoying. Dare I say it was too girly. I know how dare I lets dislike my review! The flash backs to the simpler time and the voodoo man which IMDb won't let me spell properly were great how/why this or that happened but still I couldn't wait for the last episode to be over and move onto something else on netflix.<br/><br/>season 4 - again, an AMAZING concept where anything could happen to a certain degree. It really felt like the 1950s as well. The cars, the clothes everything looked good. The main story could have been better. The clown and little Indian girl were the two highlights to most. Elsa Mars back story was interesting but I felt they could have done way, way better on this season. The ending was interesting though how they tried to tie some aspects of it together with season 2 that everyone goes nuts for. I can imagine the freaks were about as wild as freaks really were back then as we're more desensitized now but I would have exaggerated it a bit to get people enticed. Something dark like maybe Elsa would kidnap people and turn them into freaks with magic or something would have been interesting. But they aren't canceled yet so I can't wait to see the idea of season 5 even though Jessica is done. Her German accent was poor it sounded more french and what the "heck" was the bearded ladies accent. Irish? Scottish? The engaging and addictive plot of American Horror Story is something to be loved. The way the directors carried out the show over the last 4 seasons has kept me addicted and wanting more. Each actor/actress was a perfect choice for their chosen roles. Jessica Lange played her parts exceptionally and Evan Peters is fantastic. American Horror Story is for all those who love a good thriller and love to be kept wanting more and more. AHS kept me glued to the screen from the very first episode of Murder House till the very end of Coven. As I have not yet seen the 4th season I cannot review what I think of it, however I feel like it will keep me on edge just like the other 3 seasons. Since this is a show in anthology format, I'll review it season by season. First the common things.<br/><br/>1. Jessica Lange, Frances Conroy and Evan Peters are extremely great actors. I'm in love with their acting. Especially Jessica. I can't stress that enough.<br/><br/>2. Kathy Bates, Lily Rabe, Denis O'Hare, Angela Bassett. They come in next. (Lily Rabe from seasons 2 and 4 come in at the first position)<br/><br/>3. Almost every recurring character or characters that are only for a season or two are played by REALLY GREAT ACTORS. I can't believe. Acting in this show is it's best feature. I mean, I want to name them, but there are so many of them.<br/><br/>4. Decent character development. Even the bad characters are given one and it's good to see that.<br/><br/>5. Plot lines are good. When they make sense that is.<br/><br/>6. Not scary per se, but thrilling and creepy, but then again, I don't get scared by the things it had to offer. I was mildly scared in a few scenes overall.<br/><br/>Now a season by season review:<br/><br/>1. Murder House - 5.5 or 6/10 - Overall it sucks, but parts of it are genuinely amazing. It gets boring in the middle, and the overall story is just meh. But it had it's moments.<br/><br/>2. Asylum - 9.5/10 - High point of this show. You'll be hooked. I didn't like a particular bit of the story line but otherwise it's really really addicting and interesting. Love this season very much.<br/><br/>3 - Coven - 3/10 - It's low point. Stevie Nicks and the acting by the star cast is what gets it even the three I'm giving it. A lot of made up stories that they don't stick to in the end. The entire plot is really messed up and nothing really sticks. All it does is keep falling apart.<br/><br/>4 - Freak Show - 8.5/10 - Great plot. Good stories. Good revelations. Had no hopes after season three and after looking at the plot of the fourth one. But I was really happy with what we got. It was great.<br/><br/>My advice, watch only seasons 2 and 4. You'll be satisfied with what you get. American Horror Story (TV Series)<br/><br/>A series (of four so far) that centers on different characters and locations: including a haunted house, an insane asylum, a witch coven, and a freak show. 'American Horror Story' was created by the co-creators of 'Glee', but the shows have little in common besides that. Although the stories change completely in each series, the characters generally stay the same. American Horror Story is an American horror television series created and produced by Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk. Described as an anthology series, each season is conceived as a self-contained miniseries, following a disparate set of characters and settings, and a storyline with its own "beginning, middle, and end.<br/><br/>Vague Story Line: (Huge Spoilers) Series 1- revolves around the Harmons, a family of three, who move from Boston to Los Angeles in order recover from past anguish. But what the Harmons don't know is that the house they've moved into is haunted. But it's not haunted by friendly ghosts - it's haunted by demonic creatures. The creatures have a history of not only spooking the house's residents but also devouring them. Everyone who lives in this house throughout the hauntings dies and stays there for ever after, trapped for eternity. Eventually, the Harmons family undergo their death. The daughter commits suicide by overdose. The Mother by childbirth and the offspring through cot death (the twin survives but is kidnapped). And finally the husband through hanging, forced upon by one of the vengeful ghosts.<br/><br/>Series 2- The horror unfolds within the confines of an eerie insane asylum in the second series of this acclaimed thriller. Set in 1964, the "Asylum" series digs into the dark pasts of the hospital's patients, doctors and administrators. Main character Sister Jude, a troubled nun, quickly finds herself at odds with the twisted Arthur Arden, a doctor with a penchant for experimental procedures. The story involves a journalist entering the Asylum for research. After only one return she is held there for being homosexual as this was considered a curable mental illness in the late 50/60's.<br/><br/>Series 3- tells the secret history of witches and witchcraft in America. Over 300 years have passed since the turbulent days of the Salem witch trials and those who managed to escape are now facing extinction. Mysterious attacks have been escalating against their kind and young girls are being sent away to a special school in New Orleans to learn how to protect themselves. Wrapped up in the turmoil is new arrival, Zoe, who is harboring a terrifying secret of her own. Alarmed by the recent aggression, the long-absent supreme, sweeps back into town determined to protect the coven and hell bent on destroying anyone who gets in her way.<br/><br/>Series 4- begins its tale in the quiet, sleepy hamlet of Jupiter, Florida. The year is 1952. A troupe of curiosities has just arrived to town, coinciding with the strange emergence of a dark entity that savagely threatens the lives of townsfolk and freaks alike. This is the story of the performers and their desperate journey of survival amidst the dying world of the American carny experience.<br/><br/>Each episode is full of mystery to excite the viewer. Very commonly AHS uses a 'conceal and later reveal' tactic to create a strong factor of suspense and surprise. I found the thriller extremely captivating and it had me glued to the television for the hour long episodes every week! Concentration is very important when it comes to AHS as if you miss a second; you are likely to miss a vital piece of information. As I am good at paying attention I have noticed a few things that don't quite add up in the series. Production and positioning mistakes I can understand but not abiding by the rules of characters superpowers is a silly error of story line. For example, the supreme witch in the third series can bring back people from the dead but doesn't when another good witch dies, with no reason not to do so like jealousy. <br/><br/>I would certainly advise this too anyone into psychedelic mystery thrillers. <br/><br/>10 out of 10 from me I have not seen the fourth season since I don not have FX, but I have seen the first three seasons via Netflix, and I have to say, this is a weird yet scary and original show. When I first started to watch the first season, I almost stopped in the first episode because it came across as so weird, but I decided to stick with it, and I'm so glad I did. The first season wasn't as scary in my opinion, but it was very unsettling and innovative. With great acting and good visuals, I was able to become immersed in the amazingly wacky plot. The second season, in my opinion, is the best one. It is truly scary without relying completely on gore, but, don't get me wrong, it does have quite a lot. I'm just saying that they don't rely on the blood for scares. Although it is unsettling, Asylum has many more factors that make quite terrifying. This genuine horror combined with more wacky side plots creates another innovative season. At this point walking into the third season, I loved the actors. However, keep in mind that many of the actors are in season after season, but they play different characters in each season, as it is an anthology series. I loved the third season for different reason. It is my second favorite. It has probably the least scares, but it is more character and plot focused. The plot is perfect even without the wacky side plots that I came to expect from the first two seasons. The characters are also great. Although they are witches, as it is Coven, you can relate to each one in a different way. They are outcasts for their freakish abilities and certain traits, and everyone has experienced outcast before. This season doesn't let up on the gore either. It is after all a late night TV- MA series. Although it is the least scary, it is unsettling They are all fairly scary and this one has enough scares to drive it along and to obsess scare lovers. Overall, bases on the first three seasons, AHS is a great TV show that makes me wish I had FX. It is torture waiting for the seasons to come on Netflix and when they finally do, I finish a season in a week or so. I love every season of American Horror Story, not a lot of others can agree with me cause most people like one season better than the other. For me personally I like the 1st season the most because the storyline of it was just so great, also the 3rd season isn't as bad as everyone makes it sound. I just love this series, I love this show better than any other show because for me it contains drama, horror and romance which I all love. Being called American Horror Story (Don't let the name fool you) Some episodes are not even scary and then you have people who complain that the who season isn't scary, you need to wait or maybe the show isn't that scary or not scary at all to you. Since its bloody beginnings, American Horror Story has been known for its macabre settings, dark plot lines, and highly intricate storytelling, along with insanely unexpected twists and gallons of bloodshed. Each season—or rather, miniseries—has presented us with a new sinister and gripping nightmare to decipher. For those who have yet to watch American Horror Story, it is important to note that each season is a story in-and-of-itself. Mostly the same actors return for the recurring seasons, but as entirely new characters with different names, backgrounds, and story lines. AHS prides itself on being able to bring something new to the table with every season, ranging from historical time periods to resounding statements on infidelity, insanity, oppression, and discrimination.<br/><br/>The first series, Murder House, follows the Harmon family as they move into their new home, which they soon discover was the location of over 20 murders and suicides. The Harmon family struggles with both internal and external demons that haunt them, escalating to a violently climactic finale. The second series, Asylum, takes place at a mental institution in the 1960s, where patients are subject to cruel and inhumane treatment. A deep sense of dread and terror harbors over the asylum as it delves into plots involving demon possession and extraterrestrial abduction. The third series, and arguably the fan favorite, is Coven. As suggested by the title, the season follows a coven of witches as they defend their territory against voodoo practitioners and witch hunters attempting to harm them. Coven is, by far, the best-rated and most watched AHS season to date.<br/><br/>This brings us to season four of American Horror Story, entitled Freak Show. With the episodes its has had under its belt, it is evident AHS has taken on a very different and arguably more discomforting tale of terror than its usual supernatural route. Freak Show takes place in the town of Jupiter, Florida in 1952. It focuses on a group of—you guessed it—freaks. The disfigured, the deranged, and human oddities from all around the world that have been ridiculed and banished from the "normal world" take refuge in Freak Show, a struggling carnival and circus performance that is run by Elsa Mars. <br/><br/>The "freaks" in AHS: Freak Show come in all shapes and sizes: The Bearded Lady; Legless Suzi; Bette and Dot, the Siamese sisters; Paul the Illustrated Seal, who has a seal-like body; Lobster Boy, who has hand deformities; Meep, a small man from the jungle whose specialty is biting off the heads of chickens; Ma Petite, a tiny Indian woman who is small enough to fit in bird cages. And the list goes on. Best of all, Freak Show also follows the agitating and gratuitously gory serial murders of Twisty, a terrifying clown whose horrific glare can frighten even the bravest of horror fanatics. We have also come to experience the grisly acts of Dandy, and attractive but clearly deranged young man with a taste for blood.<br/><br/>Fans can expect AHS: Freak Show to swing into full gear now that the season has taken off. It had a highly promising start and entered unexpected territory, but the series can only escalate in suspense and carnage from here—as expected from any season of AHS. However, Freak Show feels more humanistic and empathic than its previous seasons. It's a tale of discrimination against those that are different and misunderstood. Furthermore, it delves into the struggles of identity and survival for these individuals. They want to be seen as people, not merely sideshow attractions, yet they understand this is the best they can do as a result of their deformities and feelings of disconnect from the societal norm. This season has definitely brought a new ambiance to the American Horror Story anthology, and as a devout fan, I cannot wait to see where they take the series from here. Be sure to catch AHS: Freak Show every Wednesday night at 10/9c. And a word of warning: If you have a deathly fear of clowns, I sincerely wish you the best of luck getting through this season. Actually I didn't plan to write a review on American Horror Story, because it's a tough one to express how fan-fabulous-tastic this series is. I dreamt for such kind of series for about 10 years, and pow! Here we go. :)<br/><br/>I love every second, no matter what setting, which main topic leads the story or which hero is in focus. The cast is a blast, the pictures are eye candy, and I cannot tell you, how exciting every plot actually is. You have to see it, to believe it!!! If I could, I'd give 20 or even a 100 stars and many more. 10 stars don't do justice. Stunning, breath-taking, surprising - admirable. A league of it's own.<br/><br/>Also, it's the first series, I consciously remember where actors speak authentic German. Spanish and French is common and they always do it well. But well trained cast at AHS considering season 3. I am utterly impressed by language skills!!!<br/><br/>AHS is plain perfect!!! Loving it, dearly!! I have read all the reviews and can only say that I wholeheartedly agree with the people who appreciate the genius that is The American Horror Story Anthology.<br/><br/>Each series it gets better, and is so ultimately rewatchable. The ensemble cast are collectively fantastic inhabiting totally different characters.<br/><br/>They all deserve awards, Jessica Lange deserved hers. She is compelling to watch, sometimes through your fingers as you don't know how scary it will be. That is success.<br/><br/>I read that Lange was initially brought in for a much smaller part, but the creators loved her so much they expanded her entire character as a result.<br/><br/>I enjoy the darkly comic scenes such as Kathy Bates as Madame LaLaurie being yanked around on a collar and lead in the graveyard scene by Angela Basset, sheer genius, I hope they keep going.<br/><br/>It's worth having Netflix just to watch over again, or owning the dvds, either, except pirate copies. This cast and crew produce a quality show that deserves its full loyalties so that they may long continue.<br/><br/>Encore!!! I for one love the first episode of the 4th season. It really tries to make it as eerie as possible and keep us guessing as to what is coming next. <br/><br/>I really find it hard to believe some people reviewed it and gave it a 1 star? Anyone who gave this a 1 star should just stop watching television altogether because it is shows like this that are taking over television. They must have seen the title and went oh this might be interesting. If you have watched the other 3 seasons you know what to expect the show will push the boundaries as far as they can and then some. Someone compared it to pornography in another review? I could easily name other shows which show a lot more sexual scenes.<br/><br/>I loved it. The characters, the scenery, the eerie carnival feel, the suspense. I hope anyone who reads this will at least give it a shot as it could be up there for the series of 2014. I've now watched Freak Show and Cult and whilst the former was much better, respectful and of its subject and treated them like equals, both were plagued with plots that just flatly made no sense.<br/><br/>Every single episode of Cult just left me completely distracted thinking about how little sense it all made, and had completely mixed messaging. Never mind the Lena Dunham episode, which was completely unnecessary and contributed nothing to the story. That would get 0/10 on its own. Also the graphic violence in Cult has no greater meaning and is practically sexualised, so is one of the few times I can genuinely see that a TV show could encourage people to be violent. Sure the alien side plot was unnecessary, but aside from that, 1 + 2 carried well. Wouldve loved to see kathy bates in asylum but nevertheless...
after that, sh t "actors" started slipping in through the cracks. Please, ryan murphy, send all of them off to scream queens as youre reprising that Melodramatic garbage.
Also- not all singers have to act, too. You are allowed to tell them no. Its a different, twisted kind of a tale. I like it. Nothing much else to say really. Only thing I can't understand is Cuba Gooding Jr's voice.. I mean, are we on crack and our voice has suddenly had a reaction to chemicals. Not sure but it did make season 6 hard to watch Amazing actors better seasons by order asylum,muder house,1984,cult,Roanoke other seasons are meh apocalypse is the worst Murder House was enjoyable, and mostly well executed, though obviously inspired from other acts of horror throughout time. A good homage and a bit of a spin. The first half of Asylum was so bad I couldn't continue the show. Rating is mostly for first season, with a slight tinge of despair brought upon by Asylum's failures. I watched first season.. it was not bad... However after few episodes it became very repetitive... I do not believe in these ghost houses, which probably also doesn't help.. I may watch the rest.. but not now, in summer... maybe in boring winter nights :D... ONE HELL OF A SHOW!
Great plots, amazing acting ( which is not usual for a TV SHOW), INTELLIGENT, amazing characters development.
The writes are smart. Everything has a reason and a point.
Go watch it! I will recommend you season 2 (ASYLUM). One of my favourite shows on TV, mainly because the casting is amazing. Some seasons definitely better than others. They will never beat their first 3 seasons (amazing), Cult was pretty close though! Some seasons have too many story lines going on and just don't make sense, such as Hotel. I have skipped over some seasons completely- Freak Show and 1984. However, it is still my favourite show, never know what you're going to get which makes it 10x more exciting! Stories are great and music is fantastic. It's so matched with the show. It's horrible but great! AHS is my all time favourite show. While being imperfect at times, the show embodies true campy horror in its most unique form. This show is like nothing that has ever been created. Besides the aspects of horror this show takes on, the most important thing is the way the show portrays and delivers significant messages to the audience. For example, Cult (season 7) expresses the idea that no government system is perfect and while society fights for the better political party to such an intense extent, the show reveals that in reality no politician is a perfect politician. The show hints that we blindly allow ourselves to be led down destructive paths by destructive people - just like how America went into crisis during their 2016 election when Donald Trump was voted in (which is what the season revolves around). Another great example of the messages this show demonstrates is in Freak Show (season 4) as the show fights for equality and the belief that no matter what kind of outcast you are in society, you deserve to be treated as a human. AHS takes on the genre of horror and uses it in a way that prompts in-depth insight and discussion.<br/><br/>My rankings of the seasons from best to worst are easily:<br/><br/>1- Cult (Evan Peters in this season left me speechless, his performance as the different cult leaders was beyond incredible and this goes for everyone in the season, the acting was amazing. The message behind this season is what makes it my favourite, it was very interesting and included major plot twists in the shows finest fashion. Out of all the seasons, Cult was the one that made me think the most. Nothing can top the season for me!)<br/><br/>2- Freak Show (This was the first season I had ever watched by ahs and it ranks so highly because it is probably the shows most unique season. This is the season that got me hooked on ahs. I struggle to put to words the greatness of this season. The storyline was by far one of the shows greatest and most significant.)<br/><br/>3- Hotel (CAMPY HORROR!!! This season is completely eccentric and quite unsettling which creates the greatest version of horror! This season included a range of different aspects which created a storyline that hooked you every minute. Hotel is the shows true horror season and they did it in a way that true horror fans can appreciate. While some may say this season over stepped many boundaries, I believe that is what is exciting about this season. I am obsessed!)<br/><br/>4- Apocalypse (This season was unquestionably messy at times as it turned into a sequel of Coven and Murder House, however you can see how hard the show tried with this season. The season ranks highly for me because you cannot deny this season was truly exciting, unique and individual. I love that the season revolved around the idea that evil cannot be rid of in this world. The last episode of this season was easily one of the shows greatest endings of all and Cody Fern's performance and character is a huge highlight amongst all of ahs!)<br/><br/>5- Murder House (This season would have ranked number 1 for me if it didn't end the way it did. I found this season predictable and I love when the show includes twists that you don't suspect, so I felt let down in the last couple episodes. I would have liked to have seen more added to the plot. However, I know this season changed the game for horror movies as it was completely unique in its time of release. The highlights for me were easily Tate's story and the fact we got to understand and love all the characters of the season.)<br/><br/>6- Coven (I didn't expect to enjoy this season as much as I did but it perfectly represented female empowerment in the best way possible. I loved the witch craft storyline, however it would have been so much more interesting to have shown more of the 7 wonders test. It was all round a good season even while lacking horror aspects and I think this usually ranks more highly for the fans because it's definitely aimed to hook the teens. Either way, it was enjoyable to watch.)<br/><br/>7- Asylum (This season is usually rated number 1 for most ahs fans, however this season just didn't really do it for me. I began this season with excitement, knowing it was everyones favourite but I was let down by the alien plot. I did not enjoy any of the scenes involving the aliens, I found it ruined what could have been an incredible plot without it. The asylum itself with the journalist and the unsolved murders of bloody face were top notch ahs and didnt need to be ruined with the aliens. However, I can appreciate the deeper message and I did enjoy this season to some extent as the entire asylum storyline was interesting.)<br/><br/>8- Roanoke (The first 4 episodes of this season were slow burners for me. I almost didn't want to continue watching this season. It was certainly unique taking on the horror documentary style which I usually love, yet this season took almost too long to build. I got super into this season once it was in its last few episodes. The first half of this season didn't do it at all for me while the second half was one of my favourite parts of all of ahs. Therefore, for me it's a conflicting season. Shout out to the show for trying to create something different though.)<br/><br/>9- 1984 (This is the season I wanted to love the most and I tried so hard to love it, but I just couldn't. The highlight of this season was all the 80s theme and the attempt to recreate a plot like Friday the 13th. However, that's where the highlights end for me. The season was completely messy and I felt like not even ahs knew where they were going with it. The first four episodes could have been put into one episode and then the last few episodes of the season with all the satan stuff??? WHY? The season as a whole didn't make sense and it could have been the best season if it were made far more simple. Once again, Cody Fern was a major highlight for me in this season so at least we can appreciate that.)<br/><br/>Overall, AHS tops all horror shows due to its individuality and campy style of horror as well as portraying meaningful messages. The Harmon Family move from Boston to LA to "start over." Ben (Dylan McDermott) is a psychologist who was seduced by one of his students (Kate Mara). His wife Vivian (Connie Britton) is will eventually become pregnant. Their teen daughter Violet (Taissa Farmiga) hates school and is suicidal. All kinds of people keep popping into their house as we try to figure out which ones are ghosts and which ones are not. The opening made me laugh when Jessica Lange claimed she didn't make it in Hollywood because she didn't do nudity. And we now know about the Black Dahlia.<br/><br/>I liked the characters, except there were too many of them. I think 6 should be the limit on ghosts. The program grows with twists and complexities with things that are semi-predictable.<br/><br/>Guide: sex. sex talk (no F-word) Male butt nudity. My fave show OF ALL TIME!!! Some seasons are better than others, but overall an amazing show! Highly recommend I am so glad they got back to the main point, which is a good horror show. It is not politics with this season. It is a return to the slasher flicks of the 80's. Highly recommend! I love them all. The 80's season was epic and my favorite one yet. I've loved every single season up until I watched Apocalypse (Should Be called Coven 2). However, the acting in all of these is superb. Well every season is pretty different so its hard to rate, personally I really only liked 2. I thought 1 sucked but 4 and 5 were okay never saw 3 for some reason 6 sucks and 7 is meh. I think they are well done for sure but they are not for everyone. you won't like them if you are a trump supporter because it will likely hurt your feelings, problem not for the super religious either. for me tho I just don't find them at all scary which is what I want out of a show called American horror story, idk I think the actual horror is the bottom of the barrel and the acting and production do a lot to make up for it but its just not what I want it to be. give it a try tho theres something there for sure, and like I said you may love some seasons and hate others so keep that in mind. I've watched the first two seasons and this could have been great but they seem to want to shock people more than tell a story. The second could have been great but there was just to much the Aslyum story with the reported and bloody face could have been brilliant I could even take the possession. But then throw in aliens, nazis, zombies and non of them explained just left it feeling half done. 
The first was the same started off great with to many half told stories where as if they could have focussed on a few intertwining stories and done them properly. 
This hopefully gets better but fear again the shock value outweighs a consistent and fully told story. 
I am not bothered my gore or graphic ness but would like it to have context not just be thrown in because they want to shock. 
I did like the using the same people different characters. AHS 9- 81%
I was really impressed with this season of AHS, by touching on realistic and sensitive subjects concerning the presidential election, women degradation, and white fascist supremacy.
This show had one of the best character developments I have ever seen. An absolute phenomenal acting and character development with Sarah Paulson.
This season was quite the experience. 
Story wise and execution: 30.8/35
Acting: 25/25
Camera work: 12.9/20
Sound: 12.3/20 With every season being different, it's kind of difficult to give a rating, so 8 stars is how I feel about the series as a whole so far. I'm a big horror movie fan, but I'm horrible at keeping up faithfully with TV shows. With that being said, after roughly a week and a half of watching the show in order on Netflix from Season 1 (I knew I didn't have to start there), I'm into Season 4. I like the pace of the episodes & so far, there seems to be little "fluff" in the writing, solely for the purpose of stretching out an episode/season. A bit here & there, but not enough for it to be a turn off for me. Season 2 is my favorite hands down right now. Honestly, the start of Season 4 is not grabbing my attention as quickly, but I'm going to stick with it. When I watched the first vignette of the first episode, I was hopeful. I love a good, spooky haunted house show as much as anyone else. After that, though I think the first episode spent too much time illustrating that the father of the family (played by McDermott) was an ass, the mother was a weakling, and the child was the only one with a spark of likability. The freaky sexual issues dominated the first episode and to be honest, I wasn't impressed. It was as I watched the second, and then the third episodes, something happened. I began to be hooked. The peripheral characters absolutely make the show, and I began to realize that the main characters were MEANT to be unlikeable. When the couple's daughter tells her mother in the third episode "you're weak" you find yourself cheering "yes! exactly what I was thinking!" The strange southern neighbor lady played by Jessica Lange is in on the tricks the house pulls, as is her daughter Addy. The maid Moira, seems to come along with the house and insinuates herself into the lives of every family who lives there. The house is old enough to have a million secrets and a million tricks to play on this oh so unlikeable family. Sometimes it seems to almost take care of them, and other times to simply toy with them. I can't wait to see what happens next. I have not had cable for years now. I stream on Netflix, Hulu, Prime, Crackle, etc. I have had this show saved to my Netflix and Hulu watch lists for a long while now. I finally decided to start it on this past Friday. This has got to be one of the best shows I have ever watched. I'm watching season 5 right now and it's early Monday morning. I just read Evan Peters is not returning for season 9 and why. I actually get it. So far he and Jessica Lange have been outstanding!!! Although Lange is not in season 5 I read. Bummed Peters will not return for season 9, after reading why I get it. This show is really raw, real horror/slasher/gore just a damn good show!!! I really hope Jamie Brewer will join season 9. She is also amazing. Everyone from acting, writing, just all of it I'm wowed and I'm addicted to this show. I have hardly stopped since Friday and it is Monday morning and I'm a few episodes into season 9. I can't believe I put this one off for so long but one good thing, at least I can watch 8 straight seasons. I was not expecting this to be this amazing. It seems with every passing series we have gone from brilliant, to great to ok and so on - we now reach Bleah!
The first ten minutes of episode one were superb - somehthing different at last I thought - but no, we have quickly decended into nonsensical, over the top more of the same but in an ever so slightly different setting. Wow someone is gay in 2018 how shocking! As I look back at episode two I realise just about absolutely nothing happened. I very nearly turned off and if this mess doesnt improve very quickly I doubt I will last until the end and then certainly will not be watching any further series.
A real shame, it just seems to have run out of steam. Marked this as possible spoilers, just in case.<br/><br/>
I was pleased with Seasons 1, 2, 3, and 6. Very good scares, and average to above-par plots/writing. Seasons 4, 5, and 7 were awful, however. In particular, 7, mainly due to the ridiculous amount of political overtones. The first few episodes are nothing but negativity towards anything Trump, painting all Trump supporters as monsters, and racist bigots. Most of it is meant to set up a satire plot to bring to light all the inherently stupid accusations both left and right think of one another. This is not really the issue. We're shown an even amount of political cannibalism (eventually), but the one issue I have, that the producers and writers can't drop is their rise against the (imaginary) patriarchy. Even in season 6, the idiot girl who goes into the woods with her two friends mentions it. This leads me to believe that this is actually a point the writers are attempting to get across to the viewer, and not just framing more narrative for the show's topic at hand. <br/><br/>
This sort of divisive garbage hollywood keeps feeding us is exactly why I see no need to pay for cable tv, or watch movies in theaters anymore. I'm not subscribing to that garbage rhetoric, and neither should you. American Horror Story was incredible in the first season. As a horror movies viewer, I found it well-directed, excellent casts, with good location and a strong and unpredictable story in the first season. At the beginning I wasn't sure if I'm going to watch it. After episode three, I had no doubt that I'm going to follow it to the end. I did and no regret. What made the serial distinctive was the unpredictability of it, which usually is the weak point of horror movies and series. The ending was suitable for the story too. But the second season was a disaster. The story was a weak mixture of some routine stories with irrational connections. The castes weren't acceptable. The usage of surreal scenes was clumsily. And finally the ending was a total disaster. I'm not sure if I'd watch the third season. Probably I'll wait to read the reviews and see if the viewers are satisfied with the new season. I am not going to get to the storyline. You have to see it yourself. I didn't think they could do as well as last year and I was having a hard time getting into it for the first several episodes. I kept comparing it to the first season. It is not a ghost story. But it is a horror story. At first I was put off by the recasting of the same actors but darn it , it really works. Evan Peters is a very talented actor and I am a fan of Zachary Quinto. Lily Rabe is excellent. Now, as for Jessica Lange. Why did she not win the Golden Globe? This woman is amazing. This years' performance from her had so much more depth and the level of acting she shows is astronomical. I just saw the last episode and I am already eagerly awaiting another season. i truly love this show... I'm a horror story movie addict and for the past months I've been scouting for something new but old at the same time... then atlastI've stumble upon this treasure of a series... it (murder house season 1) has everything a horror movie needs.. a hunted house, ghosts, a love story with a twist, mystery, and of course sex! the acting, brilliant! i love tate, truly embodied someone who is a psychopath, but violet is kinda stiff for my liking.. awesome performance by miss lange, love her so much .. mr and mrs harmon was depressing.. in a good way that is.. hope they make more movies like this!<br/><br/>bravo! A wonderful masterpiece of suspense and horror. Each episode continues to captivate the mind and stimulate your darkest fears. I have never been able to get into a TV show easily; only after watching a few episodes then I would decided to become regular viewer. As soon as I watched the first episode; which was recently after the second season premiered, I was hooked. I watched the First Season from Afternoon to the next day(weekend gone! LOL) but that's how appealing this show is. A Must watch! My new personal Favorite TV Series. I cannot wait for the rest of season 2 to air and I'm incredible excited for the new twist in next years Season 3. There are VERY few shows in which I want to see EVERY episode. Most recent have been "Invasion" (which unfortunately didn't last long). Then there is "Glee". (I haven't missed 1 episode and I own both season 1 & 2.) Now, there is "American Horror Story". I haven't missed 1 episode of it either. I plan to own seasons of this show as well. Initially, I was introduced to AHS from a trailer during "Glee", claiming that the writers of AHS were from Glee. If this is true, than DOUBLE KUDOS! ♥ Thanks!! It is OBVIOUS that I like musicals from watching all the Glee. The stories are very intricate too, I enjoy the diversity without holding back. Just as AHS, every week is more intense. My husband and I discuss what we believe will happen, or HAS happened without the show telling us. I LOVE THAT!!! Wednesday was a sad day knowing that next week, there will be no continuance. But we WILL be happy once again when AHS returns. Keep on pushing those boundaries! WE LOOOOVE IT! I remember when Horror actually meant having someone who's possessed or a room that contains a dead girl's body or a monster ...etc<br/><br/>But now Horror means talking about Trump and other issues that doesn't actually concern any of us!
Not to mention the amount of +18 scenes in the show! I'd call that porn!<br/><br/>I'm not a politician nor a person who wants to discuss "nowadays problems" I'm simply a person who wants to ACTUALLY watch a horror show, is that so hard to ask for? Having the same actors and actresses over and over again, the same house story TWICE, annoying characters, no horror at all, +18 scenes over and over again??? I mean if you called this show "american mess story" or "american chaos story" that would actually give people insight of what they're about to go through!<br/><br/>0.0/10, what a horrible horrible show! Please don't watch it and please stop making new seasons we're disgusted Season 7 is soo wrong. The Liberals are the mess up ppl. AHS Cult color coats the Republicans. tsk tsk. I see that the production and show itself is bias and are mostly made up of far Left Liberals DemocRats! Thx. God Trump is President or else USSA would be a Socialist counrty! I have the worst taste in TV shows. I like the ones which get canceled soon, I like the ones with bad acting as long as there are attractive actors in it, I even like Gossip Girl and 90210 with crappy clichéd story lines and happenings that normally won't happen in a teenager's life. I watch a lot of reality shows, whenever there's nothing on I switch to MTV like it's a safe place and I love to gossip about shows on Twitter,FB, Tumblr& ... yeah, I'm the typical teenage girl when it comes to TV shows. But this one...<br/><br/>When I heard about it, when I saw the list of actors involved and Ryan's name as the creator I was almost sure I would hate it. Then, I gave it a try and I'm so glad I did. Cause if I hadn't I would have missed on one of the greatest things out there.<br/><br/>When I got hooked, season one was already over. I was reading about how good it is and how it has something like 17 Emmy noms and I had already watched the pilot then and tbh I hated the pilot. I taught it was one of those shoes which had to rely on sex scenes to succeed but was I wrong.<br/><br/>There is so much happening in the pilot. You almost immediately hate all the characters: The husband is a cheating sex addict jerk, The wife is bratty and demanding and thinks she is god's gift to earth and the daughter is a spoiled antisocial teenage girl. But, as the show goes on you find yourself understanding where each character is coming from. I did. It doesn't mean you will love/ like them, but you'll accept them.<br/><br/>There is everything in it! The horror is great, There is love stories, there is funny moments (although a very few and usually very sadly funny bits...) and interesting dialog. The chemistry is fine.<br/><br/>The acting in both seasons is GREAT! If I could scream this, I would. It is not natural, but it just works. everyone is great and suits the character/ costumes/ dialogs/ scenes. Everyone says the right thing at the right moment. It's just all right.<br/><br/>The only problem I have with AHS is that the sexual tension is sometimes too much. There were parts where I felt uncomfortable watching a scene and/or thinking about it for moments after watching that.(not always sex related, tough. Even simple horrific killer scenes were sometimes too much. ) It's sometimes disturbing. At the same time, this maybe one of the goods about this show, how this actually adds to the show. I think the show needs these parts.I think this may be MY problem.<br/><br/>The overall feel of the show, editing and the locations and acting and stories, it all truly lives up to the title : Horror.<br/><br/>I think this show is the best show I've seen ever. It is so disturbing and yet so enjoyable and smart and creepy and wrong and right...Just watch it! If what series creators Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk are in any way true, then their latest horror anthology "American Horror Story" aims to be just that, a horror anthology, much like other horror-themed TV series like "Dark Shadows" and Rod Serling's "Night Gallery" (with a little bit of "The Sixth Sense" and "The Shining" thrown in for good measure). But this is just the tip of the iceberg: its real aim appears to be a return to the classic Gothic horror tales of yesteryear, the era of dark shadows, ever-mounting spine-tingling suspense leading to viciously lethal scares, and just plain creepiness of the first degree all around.<br/><br/>Obviously, it's all done with a post-"Se7en" (1995), 21st-century glossiness.<br/><br/>"American Horror Story" has a set-up that's right out of any big-budget Hollywood horror flick: a dysfunctional family, the Harmons - licensed psychiatrist Ben (Dylan McDermott), his wife Vivien (Connie Britton), and their troubled teenage daughter Violet (Taissa Farmiga) - move out to Los Angeles from Boston in the hopes of starting over and reconciling their differences. It turns out that Ben was once caught in the act of cheating on his wife with one of his students, Hayden McClaine (Kate Mara).<br/><br/>They take up residence in L.A.'s infamous "Murder House," a three-story single-family home with a sordid, extremely troubled history dating all the way back to when it was first built in 1923; the house is so popular, in fact, that it's on the last leg of a tour through famous Hollywood murder hot spots that includes the home of the Manson Family murders and the spot where Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman were killed. A number of notable and horrific crimes have taken place at "Murder House" over the decades (history plays an important role in each episode of the series), a fact of which the Harmons are initially oblivious to, but soon a number of bizarre and frightening events eventually cause them to realize that their new home is haunted.<br/><br/>Along for the ride are the Harmons' next door neighbor Constance Langdon (Golden Globe-winner Jessica Lange), the Harmons' new maid Moira (dually played by Frances Conroy and Alexandra Breckinridge), the horribly disfigured hermit Larry Harvey (Denis O'Hare), and troubled teen and Ben's patient Tate (Evan Peters).<br/><br/>"American Horror Story" is both greatly acted and deeply disturbing. The one element of the series that gets you from its opening moments is the opening credits sequence, a brilliant montage of frightening and surreal images, unsettling sound effects and music (by James S. Levine), and editing (by Kyle Cooper, who also did "The Walking Dead" TV series and the aforementioned film "Se7en"). This series is pretty unsettling, but it thankfully never goes (at least this far, eight episodes into the first season) into the realm ventured to by so many of this series' big-budget Hollywood counterparts, and that is a true fright-fest down darkened corridors and the like. Thankfully this never happens here.<br/><br/>Another element of "American Horror Story" that's really worth mentioning is how the dysfunctional familial dynamics between Ben, Vivien, and Violent also play into the horror themes of the TV series. In some ways, you could say that their failing family dynamics and dramas could be called a modern "horror" in and of itself. The characters are real flesh & blood people; they're all flawed, selfish, can be bitterly spiteful of one another, and are not always sympathetic. In other words, the Harmons can be any American family out there today, the only difference being that they're haunted by ghosts.<br/><br/>Get ready for a great scare- and suspense-fest!<br/><br/>10/10 The most sacred I have ever been by simple pixels on a screen. If you are sick of the same old hero takes on monster horror than this is for you... assuming you want what is decried in the title that is. The charter are all in some (or many) way flawed in ways we can all relate to, this is important as this is why it separates from the pack, never before have i related quite so fondly with an antagonist such as I do in this series ans here every charter is in some form an antagonist, it is what make the story so terrifying it literary humanizes monsters turning in to greed, infidelity or even a simple experience you can relate to.<br/><br/>I do not want any form of spoiler in this so I keep it fairly general, my nut shell synopsis for this is if you have ever wanted to be deeply disturbed yet not scared this is your Bible it is terrifying in a way i have never felt, it fells REAL like it could acttuealy happen you can relate to a charter their flaws and their pain and have it show the monster that lives in you, of most horror the monster is an emotionless bloodthirsty being but not here... here it is your flaws, it is who you are. This series was never very clever, but the plot twists and acting kept my interest. Now I'm watching the ninth season, and I feel colossal boredom. Starting with the sixth season, the series lost all meaning and descended into a dull set of meat and dismemberment. The concept of ghosts in the film world is also very silly. Ghosts here cannot be destroyed, banished, or otherwise harmed. In fact, they are just immortal people, to whom no one can do anything. It's dumb and boring. I'll watch season nine, but I won't even start season ten. There is no desire to look at the same senseless slaughter and indestructible ghosts. I love the 1984 season it's just like an 80s slasher movie a great come back since the apocalypse season much better than season 8 I was excited to hear about this show when the commercials started running for this show. After Nip/Tuck, I was ready to welcome Ryan Murphy back to F/X, the network that aired the envelope pushing medical drama. Being constantly unimpressed by Hollywood "horror" (See: shaky camera movies, demonic possession, etc.), I gave this a try. Ryan Murphy's new show was a winner. The entertaining ensemble is ever-present in this show. This is like nothing I've seen before. It is very original, and has my vote for best show of 2011. If you have seen recent commercials, there is a tidal wave of horror shows coming soon. By the way, the new Asylum setting looks promising, and the writers are brave for starting from scratch, making this a miniseries, but with the same actors each season, such as Evan Peters and Jessica Lange. This show is going to be the top dog for horror television for years to come. The other shows better say their prayers, because this is going to be tough to top. I don't put my trust in shows that fall under the horror genre. More often than not, they end up either being "Giant Crab vs. Python/Shark Mutant" or your typical "five friends" horror movie, full of sex, but lacking in plot and depth.<br/><br/>Have no fear though. American Horror Story is a little raunchy, yes, but it makes up for it by being incredibly deep, full of twists and turns, having an eerie, suspenseful atmosphere, and full of great acting! This is the only TV show that has ever caught my attention so wonderfully. Every week, as I waited for the next episode, I felt like a little kid, waiting for Christmas morning to come.<br/><br/>There's no flaw that I can nitpick about. I think American Horror Story is the most *perfect* horror TV show out there. I don't think anything can top it. Overall, it's just a great, well-though-out TV show that doesn't disappoint. i have no idea why this show gripped me so much! i am not easily gripped, but the entire plot simply left me waiting for the next one in a way that hasn't happened since Avatar: The Last Airbender (granted, i was a tad younger then). the subtle build-up to the season's climax was so original and creative and downright amazing that i couldn't stop from constantly praising the show in my head. i paused a couple times and just reveled in my utter shock and amazement at some of the jaw-dropping twists and turns therethroughout. i think i screamed a couple times... the way that every single thing happened in this show was superb and definitely got even better as the too-short season progressed. (please make longer seasons! i'm begging you!) Wow, I don't think i have ever watched a thriller horror such as this one! I rarely get goose bumps but this just takes the case,seriously... I was so taken aback by how creepy it is and the sheer magnitude of the acting, and Jessics Lange captures your attention and just left me breathless,shocked, like "oh sweat!" that just happened? Definitely the best horror I've seen in a great while. I used to like cheesy horrors that you don't mind falling a sleep on, but with this one I don't even turn off the lights at my house while watching, really; I am in just awe of the suspense. Remarkable and very believable. I would recommend this to anyone that are looking for a roller coaster ride that never ends. I can't even imagine or guess whats going to happen next and that in and of itself is why I cant wait for another dose of this id give AHS a -10 if it was available. the scripts suck. totally. whose depraved imagination is this? yuck double yuck. i have to keep writing to fill up this review so i will. a good horror story is one thing, but a good horror story needs to be just the tiniest bit believable. there is nothing believable here. the rubber suit is a joke - where are the whips? Dylan's daughter is obviously on some major pharma downer given her reaction to everything. or maybe she inherited her deadened responses from her dad. all the characters seem to be afflicted with a major memory problem. suddenly a dead pregnant mistress? inane. the creep with the burned face? hes not a mystery, just an afterthought. the only semi believable character is jessica lange's daughter. and jessica's acting is so much better than anyone elses, what is she even doing here? I've watched every season and each time I totally get what Brad Falchuk and Ryan Murphy are giving us. 1984 was no different. Totally gnarly! This is the first series I have seen that weaves an entirely & inventively new reality each season whilst transforming many of the previous season's actors into the intricately new fabric of their uniquely themed horror tapestry.
The creative collaboration with passionate attention to each subtle detail is enthusiastically palpable. Bravo to all involved in making their art with this one!<br/><br/>Much like any new telling from a master storyteller, the careful moulding of the envisioned scene requires the meticulous imagination & foresight of a sculptor as well as the devoted patience from its anxiously anticipating audience to begin to unfold skilfully. I admittedly can find myself at the beginning of a new season scoffing at what's before me initially unconscious of a lingering loyalty to the deliciously gruesome hook of the previous season's elaborate and well crafted tale of woes.
Alas, that which has me running back for more each time, it can not immediately be presented at the dawning of a different storytelling. Albeit precisely what my greedily grasping expectations crave, the only truly satiable reward for my earnest attention is to note mentally any hasty judgment of the whole & allow the anticipation to build... because these folks... ALWAYS deliver! I liked most of the AHS series but S9 , is more like a comedy ! - the acting of Emma Roberts is so amateur in my opinion ! - this girl don't know to act ! , I hope it get's better ..because I was a fun of this show ! The new season i am enjoying.. but i dont find it very horrific.. The Freak Show is still my favourite.. Started off Meh for me but now getting so much better as we revisit the past to make sense of the future. Nuff said Watched them all through "Apocalypse" 
Ho hum and fake spoiler alert, I'll just say Stevie Nicks is easily the scariest thing I've seen (and heard) so far! 
Oh dear dark lord please make that monotone groaning stop! 
Sheesh, where's Jessica when we really need her..
P.S. Kathy is her usual great self. The unique series theme style is special and the intricate connections you see unfold between these seasons, to me makes AHS an exciting and unpredictable ride! If you are looking for something to watch to keep you on the edge of your chair, this is the series to watch. After watching Roanoke Nightmare I have to admit that the creators of this show had lots of imagination. This season is fresh, gritty and just down right gory. Didn't expect this in the slightest but as a horror fan, I adored it. Creepy to say but very true. Horror fans, time to binge watch!!! This is one of the best horror shows of all time. I have personally never witnessed such a fantastic show. Every episode is fantastic and has many wow moments. The actors are awesome and play multiple characters with finesse. Jessica Lange plays most prominent characters and Saura Paulson. They are both perfect. Evan Peters is fantastic too I love this series and I've watched it since it was aired And I will keep watching because it's priceless Specially the actors I love them But season 6 was total bull💩 Not what I expected from ahs 😔 I hope season 7 is as good as we expect I mean if I could rate season 6 I would vote 0 😅 Simple and quick review.<br/><br/>American Horror Story Season Rankings: Season 1: 10/10. One of the most flawless TV series I have ever seen. Ghosts in a haunted house with a flawed family acted so well is the recipe AHS should return to.<br/><br/>Season 2: 9/10. Despite the increase in sexual assaults and graphic violence and gore, this season has an excellent idea in the Devil infiltrating a Nunnery run Psyche ward. Great season, even if it was chaotic. <br/><br/>Season 3: 6/10. I did not like the racism, homosexuality, sexual assault, nor militant feminism and exaggerated anti-American propaganda. This was a great idea of women empowering themselves that took off into a Marxist nightmare. Did I mention bestiality?<br/><br/>Season 4: 7/10. A very up and down season that overall is better than the 3rd season. A killer clown is terrifying and the ghost mesmerizing. This is a good season with weird content decisions. Sex content is still high and the blatant homosexuality grossed me out. There needs to be a limit!<br/><br/>Season 5: 5/10. Of course, leave it to Lady Gag(a) to increase the sex content and abhorrent blood in the midst of an orgy, violence, torture, gore, and sexual assault. I'm a soldier, and yet even I was grossed out and offended by Lady Gaga's direction. This season was demonic with no moral restraints or respect. I almost decided to quit watching this show after season 5...<br/><br/>Season 6: 7/10. But then I was intrigued by the concept of a Roanoke nightmare. this season started off right. My wife and I were engaged until the end. Is there a reason endings fall apart in AHS?<br/><br/>More blood, sex, and violence is not conducive to being a superior TV show. AHS, should return to season 1 and 2's great story, moral restraint (sorta), suspenseful horror, and better character developments. AHS has one of the best TV casts around and a wonderful horror concept every year. The last few seasons though have been "meh" at best :(. I still have the faith they will pull it together. I must say that being an ardent fan of AHS, this season's pilot (Season 5) has been the most intriguing an awesome pilot of them all. I just wanted more and more, didn't want it to end, Kathy Bates was awesome as always, truly into the skin of her character ans so was Sarah Paulson, Lady Gaga still has a long way to go with her acting although as far as I have seen till now, the role demands her to be emotion-less and bland(and I am a big fan of her singing). The best part is that there seems to be more mysteries a season could handle and I hope the writers are prepared for that and provide us with an awesome season. The background score was great and the addition of Hotel California at the end served as the cherry on the cake. 10 out 10 for me This is by far my all-time favourite show! It's so different and unpredictable. I personally love the first season the best AHS Murder House, but it depends on what kind of storyline interests you the most. The second season is Asylum, third season Coven, fourth season Freak show and fifth season Hotel. I love the fact the same cast is used throughout the whole series. It lets the audience see how great these actors are in various roles. Another thing: We can barely turn the TV on now-a-days without seeing something about sex, but AHS isn't about sex and nudity. Don't get me wrong, it does contain sex scenes, but there is absolutely NO nudity... for once. Although there are some very revealing scenes. By the way some sex scenes are a tad disturbing. Couldn't of picked greater actors. But, in general its a great show for horror/thriller fans to watch:) I can see that this show has received some wildly mixed reviews. To the people who rate it poorly I defy you to give an example of a better, more compelling horror TV show.<br/><br/>The format of AHS is amazing, I love that they use the same actors to play different characters in different series. It's a really cool concept that I haven't seen in any other shows.<br/><br/>The only season that I would say was not great was the Coven, season 3. Other than that every season has been thoroughly entertaining, disgustingly compelling and shockingly disturbing. Which are all the things a good horror should be.<br/><br/>I can see why people don't like this show because it is fairly intense and does deliberately use disturbing imagery to unnerve the audience. Sometimes it can leave a bit of a sour taste in your mouth so if you are planning on watching this show then be prepared for a true horror experience.<br/><br/>Before this I doubted whether horror was a viable genre for TV. After watching this show I am convinced that horror can be one of the most compelling genres.....10/10 and well done. Watched 1st and now watching 4th season.Honestly, don't bother watching the other two. 2nd one is confusing and ridiculous and a bit like a S&M porn, but with a weaker storyline.The reviews of third season have totally put me off the idea of even trying that one. That having been said, I find season 1 and 4 quite entertaining. One has to, however, close their eyes for some plot holes and unrealistic details and just accept that this is more of a dream -like situation, where not everything has to make sense. I went with the flow and found it entertaining. It's far from great, but it has some atmosphere and some attractive side to it.<br/><br/>What I find interesting, are the repeating topics in the different seasons :the mommy issues of a disturbed individual, the ruthless matron, the exaggerated representation of homosexuality, racism and homophobia etc. It really does say something about the author of the story.<br/><br/>Oh YEAH! Whoever made the soundtrack for the 1st season is a genius. I love all the songs and they fit the atmosphere so well. That person should please make more soundtracks for more movies!! I've only seen the first season of "American Horror Story", and what I interpret from it is that it's a look at the lingering effects of bad occurrences. Just as terrible things happened in the murder house, terrible things happened in the family's life. The ghosts inhabiting the house aren't spooks as much as a metaphor for how a person can't leave certain experiences behind.<br/><br/>I understand that each season has a different story, with Jessica Lange, Frances Conroy (Ruth on "Six Feet Under"), Sarah Paulson, Lily Rabe (Jill Clayburgh's daughter) and Evan Peters appearing in each season. Having just seen the first season, I can honestly see that I'm eager to see the remainder, and not just because Jessica Lange would be my ideal cougar. Even if you see "AHS" as nothing more than a horror show, it's still one of the most thought-provoking horror shows. I'll also be interested in seeing Ryan Murphy's other shows. I watch the first season completely and almost all the season 2. Some points of this series are interesting and remind me some questions you can reach in Six Feet Under. Most of episodes let you with a feeling of depression and sometimes a total non sense. Some characters are boring and/or totally unbearable. Most of them are totally yeasty. And an important point is the lake of coherence and very illogical things you can see.<br/><br/>So this TV series work only with the feeling of curiosity for the "bizard" but the rest is so bad, that it will make you feel losing your life to watch it episode by episode. I recommend people to see Six Feet Under, that take place also in a gloomy atmosphere but with a real story line that reveal a lot of sense and interesting wondering for yourself. Asylum is my fave its a masterpiece by all means, storyline, characters, cast, soundtrack...basically everything was just perfect and the ending omg its heartbreaking. 10/10<br/><br/>Murder House is my second fave, it was very original. felt connected to some of the characters and again i loved the ending. 9/10<br/><br/>Coven is my least fave although it was not bad at all very enjoyable and laughable but its just I'm more into deeper and darker themes and yeah i hated the ending. lol 7/10<br/><br/>Note: although i liked some seasons more than others yet i rated the series a perfect 10.<br/><br/>cheers. This is a truly unique show that is perfect for lovers of the horror genre. It is a great idea to contain an entire story within a season as you always receive a proper ending. There is nothing worse than a show not finalising things. <br/><br/>American Horror Story is more than just a great concept, it also delivers with it's ideas. They are very creative and it's nice to see common cast members being utilised from season to season. They also deliver on the fear factor. There are true moments of terror and your senses are heightened through each episode. This is a really good show and the way it's heading it may last for quite some time now. It seems hard to believe that this show could ever become boring and I look forward to seeing what each new season becomes. When I say fearless, I mean it. This show takes so many risks, it doesn't hold back it's full potential in case someone is "too disturbed" by it. It doesn't play by the rules of most horror shows/movies. It's it's own animal, and it's crazy. If you watch the show and miss all of the symbolism, character arcs and development, you'd be watching 41 minutes of gore and 50 different story lines each week. But you're not, thanks to the amazingly twisted and brilliant writers. And no, this isn't the most meaningful and symbolic show out there, I think that title belongs to another show that I love, but I'm not gonna name it on here. But American Horror Story still brings in those elements quite nicely. I don't know how they bring in so many story lines and wrap them all up in the last 2 episodes. It takes very creative writing to do that, and that's what they do. Another unique and cool thing about American Horror Story is that it brings back some of the same actors season after season. All of them fantastic at adapting to their different roles and personality's. The power in their performances is one of the many things that make this show great. The characters are another great part of the show, they bring so many different personality's but you definitely get attached. And thanks to the clever writers, you have some of the best lines in TV history from your favorite American Horror Story characters. One of my personal favorite things about this show is the cinematography. I can't even describe how unique it is. One moment the camera will be totally still and another minute it's lopsided or upside down, but it fits with the theme of the show so nicely. Each season there is a song that you can identify the season with. The sound mixing for this show is great. I constantly listen to the soundtrack for all three seasons.<br/><br/>Watch it at your own risk, it's a crazy ride, but it's never let me down. Thanks for reading. I cannot how attached I am to this show. Even though it's not a continuum every season, I still love it! Everything is so original and gruesome! I love it! At first when I didn't know what American Horror Story was and I'd just see the previews, I didn't want anything to do with that. I was like, "ew" this is weird and disgusting, but when it got to American Horror Story: Coven... I decided to watch it and I fell in love! When I got to the middle of Coven, I started to watch American Horror Story, I didn't fall too much in love with that one, but I did find it trippy when Violet's dead body was found! So after that, I figured I'd watch Asylum... though asylums scare the crap out of me, that is why I did not want to watch this show in the first place because of American Horror Story: Asylum commercials. I was like F*** that! But then, I grew some and started watching it... Turns out, it is my favorite season! So, by all of this being said, I am a huge fan of American Horror Story! I hope it lasts for quite some time. Awesome Level: Varies on each season. Over all I would say it is about 87% Awesome and worth watching. Mostly on the fact that the series is inventive, dynamic, and consistently reinvents itself.<br/><br/>Short version: Season 1= Longer version of a standard horror movie Season 2= Actually Frightening and would fall into the category of Thriller/Drama/Horror movie Season 3= Violent, "TV-MA", intense and raw version of "Buffy the Vampire Slayer"<br/><br/>Miss A Season? Didn't see season one? Wanna know what happens after season 2 ends? No need to worry; because each season, the plot, setting, direction, era, all change and hit the reset button. The only thing that seems to remain the same is the cast members, but in different roles.<br/><br/>Season One: We are able to see a family slowly coming to grips with the fact that they are living in an increasingly haunted house. This season has unique touches to it that make it intense and keeps you on the edge of your seat, and biting your nails as those jump-cuts and unsettling style shadow that, of an actual horror film.<br/><br/>Though my girlfriend wouldn't watch an episode without holding on to me, it seemed that mid-season, the show had run out of fresh ideas to keep the original plot compelling. The season began to have a new haunting, and set of ghosts that were never introduced in the established plot and seemed like filler. "By the way, did you know that this also happened here? Here are some more characters to add into the house's history."<br/><br/>Season 2: This is my favorite by FAR! This is set in an Asylum, in the 60's. Asylums are already disturbing in nature; and with the added element of bringing one back to a barbaric age where certain practices are considered criminal by today's standards, the set-up alone is enough to stick in your mind and haunt your thoughts. As the season progresses the story is used after the established plot, without any fishing, filler, or deviation of the evoking drama and terror. It is in this season that American Horror Story establishes itself as a TV drama, in addition to the original Thriller/ Horror genre. Given the Solidity, integrity, and creativity in character development rather than constantly bringing in new ones, the story is as compelling as it is frightening and disturbing.<br/><br/>Season 3: American Horror Story: Coven At this point I am unable to see where or how this season will develop; I can say that the first two episodes were rather frightening. However, this Season seems to drift more toward the compelling drama which drew us in with season two. The plot seems to be solid, the characters are fascinating, but the, "Horror" has been replaced with "Creepy." I guess there is not much more to say other than I watch this season because I am a fan of the show. It is still interesting, better than the first season in plot, but if I were recommending this show to someone who had never seen it, I would tell them to check out the second season first.<br/><br/>I suppose in any sequel it is wrong to expect the original to be exactly the same. I always think it is best to simply judge each addition as its own movie, or season, and start with a fresh perspective each time. To be fair, since this show seems to be a completely different show each season, I am still very interested in what lies in store for season 4. Hope ya found this helpful. Great show. And unlike the majority of films/TV programmes, I think I actually preferred the second season. And great acting from Jessica Lange, Evan Peters etc. If you haven't yet gave it a go, do it now. It's well worth it! Perfect for any horror/thriller or suspense film fans, I think you'll love this.<br/><br/>Warning, spoilers.<br/><br/>Liked the first for it's uniqueness and really enjoyed it, but the second kept me gripped with its twist and turns and suspense. Think the mental asylum gave it more of an atmosphere. Hoping Coven will be just as good, if not better. This is one of the greatest shows I have watched. Both seasons are incredibly well written, with amazing actors. <br/><br/>American Horror Story, is the type of show that keeps you on the edge of your seat wanting more, anticipating the next episode. I was expecting great things for this show, and was highly impressed. Everything in this show makes sense, and I was never once confused, but always amazing and shocked by all the twists. <br/><br/>This show will disappoint no one. If you're into dramatic thrillers with a twist, you will love this. Watched both seasons in 2 weeks, and I can't wait for season 3! I've heard great things about American Horror Story and finally decided to watch with my friends. First episodes in season one felt the scenes were rushing too fast. Although stories are not bad but the series clearly lacks frightening atmosphere. It just feels like they are trying too hard to scare you with gory details. Half through season 1, there was nothing frightening about the ghosts in the house, instead everything felt normal and the story seemed to just drag along.<br/><br/>Decided to watch Season 2 just because of Jessica Lange and Evan Peters! love them both! Season 2 i would say was much better than season 1 although still lacking in pure horror. It wasn't convincing enough that Briarcliff was difficult to get out of, there was no clear idea of the structure of the place, the exits etc. SPOILER WARNING : There just doesn't seem to be anything scary about the fact that a doctor was a Nazi or alien abduction. Loved the Devil in Sister Mary Eunice but the final confrontation was extremely disappointing lasting mere 5 seconds. the Doctor's experiments did not come into a "SHOCKING" conclusion as the episode summary talked about and everything just trickled out of the series just like that. Some characters seemed confusing especially Lana, at times it felt like she really cared about shutting down briarcliff then she seems to be only interested in fame. However the ending of season 2 was more than satisfying and shocking. Jessica Lange exceeded my expectations, she touched my heart, her tragic story and ending was very beautifully done. Evan Peteres, Sarah Paulson did a really amazing job in season 2 and there no denying that one of the most fav characters in the series was Sister Mary Eunice. I don't think i need to mention Oliver Cromwell as we all know that he was very convincing. <br/><br/>In Conclusion, FX seems to be disappointment when it comes to series. Walking Dead has so much dreadfully boring drama in it, you forget that the world has been taken over by zombies. Although American Horror story seems to be improving, Cant wait to see Kathy Bates in Season 3 with Jessica Lange. It is going to be fun! I gave it a 2, because people, like me, assume 1's and 10's are meaningless (after all, how can any movie be a perfect 10?, especially the really crappy ones, and yet they still get hundreds of 10s). My 18-yr-old daughter selected the first episode to watch on Netflix, and fortunately (or, unfortunately, depending on how you look at it) I was in the room and watched the episode. I have personally never seen anything so vile and depraved on a TV! I was willing to overlook the profanity, but to have in a 40-minute time span, 1) a middle-aged man masturbating after viewing what he believed to be a 20-something woman masturbating, 2) a high-school girl slitting her wrists (not for suicide), 3) a psycho-killer taking out a couple of kids (the least of the objectionable material; after all, it was supposed to be "horror"). The overall storyline is pretty creative, but to include graphic depictions of stuff that doesn't add to the story is just lazy and inexcusable. I'm sure this show is a big hit with all the high school and young 20's out there, but avoid it if you value your soul. (and this kind of stuff is soul-killing!) A serie that started well and was very promissing, a different kind of horror and very much appreciated, unfotunately it has becom worse and worse every year since Sarah Paulson entered the serie, I just cant understand why the people behind this production cant see that, shes ugly, has a lisp and is very unsexy and give bad vibes overall, she is certainly not a good actress..
A serie thats surrounded by a lot of bad choises..
It really sucks! I can't get enough of this show! I have only watched season one and am so excited to see other seasons. Ahhh, so many wonderfully creepy characters, so many exhilaratingly scary story lines and so much fear on a multitude of levels. The characters are rich, the stories are intriguing, the cinematography is frightening and the music brilliant. I was so scared I did not want to leave my bed or go downstairs. How many movies or TV shows can you say have done this to you? Probably not many. And, what's nice, is that there is never a moment of boredom; it is not one simple storyline, but a complex haunted house story with woven stories of death, sex, love, ghosts, etc. This is not your classic haunted house ghost story. It extends beyond that in a most delightful way. All of the actors are really good; you forget they are actors..they were real to me. That is the highest compliment for the actors, writers and directors. You are taken on a journey through the house's residents over a period of 100+ years, so you get to see fear in a number of time periods, which keeps it interesting. All I can say is ENJOY!!! It truly is back. This TV show with its amazing cinematography, great actors, and intricate details, is truly an astonishing show. A couple of our favorite actors are back, each playing their own completely different rolls. Again like the first season, Asylum hits some social topics to bring in the show's watchers like homosexuality, religion, fetishes, and aliens to name a few. The show's jump from its common suburban area to its current dilapidated and abandoned horror house was a jump made with immaculate results. And boy does it still contain its sexy moments followed by the perfect amount of comedy relief and a lot of horror. Unlike most horror films today that focus mostly on "jump scaring" the audience, Asylum, still like the first season, has a complete layer of eerie, dark, psychological terror with a small core of complete terror and fear for one's sake. Asylum's changing to a new place and several new actors could make one thing that it would loose its majestic zeal that keeps it going, but it actually leaves one nervous and excited for the next episode. This show isn't really a horror movie put into a TV series, its more of bizarre, outlandish creepfest stretched across episodes. There are very few OMG SCARY moments in the show. Things don't suddenly pop out to terrify its audience, it relies on an overarching theme of mystery and downright strange behavior of almost the entire cast.<br/><br/>Without going into details that would reveal spoilers, you are treated to an array of Ghosts, murders, unexplained phenomenon and shocking gore that will leave you squirming around in your seat - yet asking the question "Well what the hell was that all about? I HAVE to see the next episode to find out!" American Horror Story does this unique formula very well and the audience is always left with a slew of theories as to what exactly is happening on the show.<br/><br/>It's not for the faint of heart necessarily, but it very entertaining. The second best season of AHS, only coven was better. American Horror Story is one of the hottest shows on television, but it's origins may surprise you. This innovate, unique drama, has similarities to several different shows, but most closely resembles Tales From The Crypt. Unlike Tales, the American horror stories each last one season instead of one episode. From season to season the story changes as does much of the cast, but one thing remains constant, it has some of the smartest and most daring people behind it. You may know the creators Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk, as the guys who brought you Glee, but American Horror Story couldn't be more different. In this series they show a dark twisted side that they could never get away with on network television. As I said the story changes from season to season, so I can't really do a review of the series, but I can tell you about season one. The first season of American Horror Story introduces us to Los Angeles's famous murder house, which since it's creation, ninety years ago, has known nothing but death and heartache. The house is purchased by Dr. Ben Harmon, who knows nothing of the houses history. Dr. Harmon is moving his family across the country to give them a second chance after mistakes and personal tragedies. The story is gripping and easy to follow, but what I liked more were the flashbacks that told the history of the house and explain all the weird stuff that's happening. While the cast features some very experienced, award winning actors, it's a combination of Jessica Lange and Evan Peters who makes this show what it is. Lange is a veteran actress known more for her roles on the big screen, while Peters only just made an impression on me a couple of years ago in the film Clipping Adam. Their unique yet different styles and personalities are the reason this weird show works. In the same way they are able to connect with every character in the show, they are also able to connect with every member of the audience, and that's why they are two of the three cast members who are back for the new story, Asylum. American Horror Story is not like any other show you've seen on television, in fact, I'm pretty surprised they are able to get away with some of the stuff they are doing. It's hard to find a good TV show based on the Horror genre and when you do it's usually a lame comedy. Shows like the Munsters and the Addams Family are legendary, while shows like Harsh Realm and Freaky Links just fizzled out. American Horror Story is different though, as it's innovative and pushes the limits of what you can do on television. It's a show that is most definitely not for everyone, but if you're a fan of the unusual and tired of things like Twilight and The Walking Dead, that go absolutely nowhere, check out American Horror Story, you should be pleasantly surprised. Here are a few reasons why I love this show:<br/><br/>1. NO POINTLESS SCARES. Like closing the medicine cabinet and oh there's someone in the mirror behind her who wasn't there before! But oh its just her mom saying goodnight... The scare scenes are truly horrifying by what's appropriately meant to horrify.<br/><br/>2. CREEPY AS HELL. The content is absolutely creepy and it stays with you longer than unnecessary "shocks".<br/><br/>3. INTELLIGENT PLOT. The horror genre has lost its intelligence of late and this show has brought it back. There are pieces of the puzzle to put together, thinking, analysis, perception involved. From what I've gathered, the series links several stories based on actual horrific events that happened in America (hence American Horror Story). These stories had absolutely nothing to do with each other but the writers have made it in such a way where it flows smoothly and interconnects. Difficult to pull off but it worked beautifully! <br/><br/>And on top of all that, the special effects are fantastic. Not to mention some hot & heavy scenes to spice things up! ;) I gave it an excellent 10/10. In my opinion, its even better than The Walking Dead. This is like the worst show ive ever seen honestly, all aspects are pure trash! Its so dorky and silly with terrible visuals and bad acting, and stupid plots! NOT SCARY just annoying. With the conclusion of the latest AHS season 1984, I've decided that Murder House is and will always remain the best season of the show. Honestly, the only seasons that really even FEEL like AHS are the first 4 seasons, which all included the great Jessica Lange. Once she left, a huge gaping hole was created that in my opinion, has never been completely filled. Season 1's Murder House started the show off with a narrative bang: perfect cast, brilliant script, relatable themes, horrific events, gut-wrenching drama. Asylum kept it going with a very authentic and labyrinthine period piece that put the H in Horror, with Satan and aliens thrown in for good measure. Coven is the show's most entertaining season with witches and voodoo queens. Freak Show is macabre and creepy with the series most sympathetic group of misfits. During the first 4 seasons, in addition to Lange, the show included great actors such as Kathy Bates, Dylan McDermott, Frances Conroy, Evan Peters, Sarah Paulson, Lily Rabe, Dennis O'Hare, and Angela Bassett. After Season 4, most of these actors returned in bits and pieces, but there was no more Jessica Lange and many new dubious additions.<br/><br/>Hotel was the first clunky season for me with the dubious decision to replace Lange with Lady Gaga of all people. While some parts of Hotel were good, Gaga's part was most definitely not. Then there was the boring and gimmicky Roanoke season with my least favorite horror sub-genre, the yawn-inducing found footage documentary piece. Cult was actually one of my favorite seasons, the only good season post-Freak Show, but it was great on the shoulders of the starring performances of Evan Peters and Sarah Paulson with an incredibly weak supporting cast, Adina Porter excepted. Apocalypse was pure trash, just cheesy fan service, basically Coven the Sequel.<br/><br/>The post-Lange seasons are hit or miss. I already mentioned how bad Gaga was as the Hotel lead. Sarah Paulson, while a great actress, got annoying with all the incessant screaming. Angela Bassett is 1-dimensional, essaying the same angry, sassy, over-the-top character every season. Kathy Bates and Lily Rabe have always functioned supporting actresses on the show, never required to lead. Emma Roberts actually made for a strong protagonist in 1984, but let's face it at the end of the day, she's no Jessica Lange. A couple of male actors like Wes Bentley and Cody Fern have been great leads, but Ryan Murphy shows seem to have a thick feminist vibe. This is incredibly ironic given that the first protagonist of the series was a male, played by the eternally underrated Dylan McDermott.<br/><br/>And so enters the most recent exercise in horror 1984. The season started off so great that I thought it was destined to overtake Coven as the most entertaining season and even perhaps Murder House as my favorite season. Nope. Not meant to be. At the halfway point, 1984 did what pretty much every one of the last 5 seasons have done: flip the script at the halfway point for the sake of cheap AHA moments and introducing new filler characters and creating black hole sized plot holes in the process, except 1984 is the absolute WORST of the lot at accomplishing this! The writers literally changed their story midstream because they couldn't fashion a cohesive 9-episode slasher story when shows like Slasher (in it's 2nd season) and Scream (it's first 2 seasons) have successfully done it in virtually the same number of episodes. I really thought AHS had a second life with 1984, but it's more like more of the same, same old same old. Currently, there will be a Season 10 and I have very low expectations.<br/><br/>Overall, the horror anthology series is groundbreaking and has been a playground featuring award-winning acting from the likes of Lange, Bates, and Paulson and actors who should also have won awards like Peters, Rabe, McDermott and Conroy. And many of the other actors have made valuable contributions. The camp-creepy-horror vibe has always been present, if dumbed down in the later seasons for the sake of cheap laughs. Season 10 could be the last season and if so, I recommend that Ryan Murphy get back most of the original cast from the first few seasons that made the show great and put the Story in AHS. Just a suggestion! Sara paulson is the reason i stoped watching this serie..
To bad shes still around. Absolutely incredible, I loved the storylines so much, and it made it so much more interesting that it's took inspiration from real life stories !
Covered all my favourite horror genres and I can't wait to see what's to come next This episode is so cheesy and so predictable and is just garbage. it is entertaining i will give it that. don't be fooled by the good ratings for this, everyone is just happy that the witches are back so they're and giving it 10/10. AKA - Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Don't see any props to Walt Disney and company in the credits. Cult criticizes the key figures behind the 2016 US election through it's use of archive images (which are the foundation of the story-line) and well-developed, intriguing characters the show is famous for. It tackles topics such as LGBTQ+ rights, racism, white supremacy, sexism, misandry, misogyny, feminism and planned parenthood, to name a few. A well crafted season, as unpredictable as ever, which cleverly inspires hope in a difficult time. Probably my favourite so far, despite the lack of paranormal elements AHS is usually associated with. American Horror Story is an amazingly put together TV Series, though I've taken a long time debating on how I'd want to properly write the review. For the most part I thought it would be best if I reviewed the whole show and then review each season being that I have different feelings on some seasons and episodes versus the whole.<br/><br/>I have to say that so far out of all of American Horror Story that Season 1 is by far my favorite of them all. I've watched every available episode and season ever and over, I love the show; but hands down none of the other seasons have compared to season 11.<br/><br/>American Horror Story brings the darkness and light all together properly within this beautiful compilation of stories. It has become one of my favorite shows to watch.<br/><br/>Ill be breaking down each series one by one in more in depth reviews soon. While I have seen all four seasons, I'm going to be mainly talking about 2, 3 & 4 as they are the ones that I can remember the most and all have the same problem. Lack of focus. In season 2, there are aliens, angels of death, demons & serial killers. The aliens and angels were absolutely unnecessary and just dragged the story down, making the plot convoluted beyond belief. Season 3 had witches, the minotaur, KKK and a stupid witch competition. Season 3 was definitely the worst season so far. Season 4 has freaks, demons and way too many killers.<br/><br/>This just drags down the storyline and makes it feel painful to watch. But I'm going to continue my complaint with season 3, where it had the worst ending since the Sopranos. So these witches that have hated each other all season suddenly start playing tag? Huh, wonder where this could lead too... Spoke too soon, one of them's dead. Then the majority of the episode is a conflict over how to reverse her death when in reality, it should never have happened. <br/><br/>Season 4 has been a complete mess with Edward Mordrake, the most pointless cameo since Anne Frank in season 2. I like his character, I like the actor and I like the concept. But it was just to get rid of a character that could have been killed without Edward. Dandy is becoming a serial killer but he's not even that threatening, mainly because the show is trying to go for a disturbing tone, yet it uses bright colors and uplifting music. <br/><br/>The show just needs to improve its focus. It has great acting (My only complaint being Sarah Paulson), it has interesting concepts and it has balls to take risks, even though most of these risks don't act in favor of it In my opinion, this is one of the best TV series I have ever seen. I was amazed by the story and the effect that has been created using the same cast and several different places. I will mostly review the second season,considering that it has 17 PEA (Primetime Emmy Awards) nominations.Asylum has an outstanding story line, managing to surprise,horrify and thrill the audience through each episode. The fact that the action belongs to the past is the reason why the treatment methods used in the institution are mainly exorcism and torture such as high temperature baths,"electric" therapies and strait jackets. Even if this sounds really creepy, you will be amazed by the insanity in each character and the way that they desperately try to escape. The most interesting experience is the one when sister Jude, the first nun that runs the institution is accused of killing one of the patients and the priest that started the project decides that she is mentally ill,so she is placed in the institution AS A PACIENT.Enjoy! I have to say i love this show, it has everything that i needed to see in a show. The first season and the second season have their own unique plot and storyline which keep me interested.<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to season 3, hopefully it will get even better than season 2.<br/><br/>This show must not be for anyone because of its own unique plot and the creepy feel that give you but in my point of view that what make this show so unique and very interesting. <br/><br/>This show doesn't give you the feeling of addiction to the show but somehow the show itself get all my attention.<br/><br/>The only thing i don't really into it was the idea of the alien invasion i think its ruined the horror feel of this show. From my point of view i think the show should keep it between human, murder, ghost, or some kind of other spirit that people can feel they can related to. Maybe it just me that don't feel like the alien invasion idea goes well with the plot and the theme. I'm looking for some better idea that can blow my mind which i wish i could see it in season 3. After I finished watching the pilot of American Horror Story I was conflicted, I had absolutely no idea where they were going with any of the plot lines at all. Most of what was going on seemed completely unrelated and I didn't feel much of a desire to keep watching, but it's the Christmas holidays and frankly I had nothing else to do while I wait for The Walking Dead to return in February.<br/><br/>Whilst most people classify TWD as a horror, I'd have to disagree, whilst it's my favourite show ever it's probably more an action/drama/character-based show that is based around a horror concept. American Horror Story truly is a horror show, completely unlike anything else out there at the moment. There's no attempt to scare you through the well covered medium of loud noise (Silent Hill) or off-timed jumps (Insidious, Sinister, etc.), it'll do so by creeping you out with more humanised concepts of old horror tales. The characters or entities that you're supposed to fear are mostly introduced as regular human beings, leading you to empathise and support them from time to time, as you're slowly fed bits of information regarding their horrific pasts and how they all connect to the haunted house that is the centrepiece for the show. The cast all deliver relatively solid performances, the praise for Jessica Lange is well deserved, however my standout choice so far has to be Evan Peters as Tate Langdon, who truly gripped me with his sub-plot alongside the young Violet (Taissa Farmiga). So overall, you won't see a lot in American Horror Story that you haven't seen before, yet you'll never experience anything quite like this at the same time. The scares may not always be first class, and if you're a seasoned veteran when it comes to horror you probably won't be hiding behind your pillow, but the mystery behind what's going on is probably what will keep you going. There's no doubt it has done for me, and I can't wait to find out what's truly going on. I watched AHS in a quick way: 2 - 3 episodes at night. I guess once you have to wait for a week or two to get back to see next chapter it might create tension. Though my opinion is that AHS filled a house with a ghosts whom you would not get see again, in this way taking director walked a thin line of adding something that leaves you thinking ¨what¨ or ¨why¨. Either I found AHS really horror. It is more mystery for me then any other genre. <br/><br/>As some other users wrote - it is not typical haunted house story. As well it did contained some typical ¨I see stuff, but I just don't get scared¨ reaction. I would be out of that house after really short time. There was some moments that you feel tension between characters, but in many cases they were reacting following a ¨plot¨ and you could not sense natural behavior...<br/><br/>Anyway it is watchable and enjoyable piece. If your a horror fan, look no further. Absolutely amazing show and gets better season by season. Season 1- Murder House- This is where most people fell in love with this show. I mean, yes it was the first season, so either they liked it or they didn't.
But I watched this because of the rave reviews I kept hearing about this season. It was fun, scary, and extremely creative. It is what hooked most people and kept them wanting more. The cast is great, the storyline is brilliant, and it's just a good time. Second favorite season out of all of them.
(I give it a 10/10)<br/><br/>Season 2- Asylum - This season threw me off in the beginning because I wasn't sure where it was headed at all. The aliens, the religion, it felt so strange, but it all ties together so well in the end, and actually ended up being one of my favorites. Highly recommend this one. The performances in it are unbelievably good as well. I think this season also has one of the most satisfying endings.
(I give it a 9.5/10)<br/><br/>Season 3- Coven- Season three is my all time favorite. I have watched it time and again, and never grow tired of it. It may be because I love everything that has to do with witches, and have since I was a child, but please give it a shot, because it is wonderful.
The Jessica Lange/Sarah Paulson mother daughter duo was brilliant. I love both of their characters so much, and they compliment the hell out of each other. Kathy Bates as Madame Laularie (based on a real person) was phenomenal. She is and always has been a gem, and a wonderful addition to this show. Highly recommend this season.
(I give it a 10/10)<br/><br/>Season 4- Freak Show- I didn't think I was going to like this season in the first episode, but if you give it about two episodes and stick with it- I think this season is a blast. I ended up loving everything about it. I think the fact that Jessica Lange is the lead, makes this season work so well also. This woman is talented as hell. That's why I feel like this show started going downhill when she left. This is, unfortunately, the last season she appears in (except a small part in season 8).
(I give it a 9.5/10)<br/><br/>Seasons 5-7 - imho ... I didn't LOVE any of them.<br/><br/>5- Hotel was okay, but felt very out of place without some of the main cast, and lady Gaga is wonderful but can't act worth a damn. Although I do think the character they made for her was fun. I also loved the serial killer episode where they brought them all back for a dinner party. It wasn't a terrible season but not a favorite by any means.
(I give it a 6.5/10)<br/><br/>6- Roanoke started out kind of promising, and fell apart completely by the end. I have no idea why they chose to jump in and out of the reality show by the end of it, and the way it all turned out was a total mess. It started out different and fun, and they just destroyed it.
(I give it a 6/10)<br/><br/>7- Cult was obnoxious as hell. I love Sarah Paulson but her character in this was hard to watch during the first half of the show. She does nothing but scream and wail and it's horrible to listen to. The politics drove me up the wall and I want just ONE show or movie that doesn't shove them down our throats, but apparently that isn't a possibility. Evan Peters was great in this but his character annoyed me. Billie Lourd cannot act, I'm sorry to those of you who think otherwise. She's monotone and the same in every single role. The only saving grace for this season was how it ended. This and 1984 were my absolute least favorite seasons they came out with.
(I give it a 4.5/10)<br/><br/>8- Apocalypse- I loved this season. Started out a bit weird, but it brought back my favorite witches- brought back Murder house, and had all of my favorite cast members again. I was extremely happy with it. Although did not love the twist at the end, that was a bit silly.
(I give it a 8/10)<br/><br/>9- 1984- HOT GARBAGE. This didn't feel like American horror story in any way. It had no plot, was like watching an all too long Friday the 13th parody movie. It was all over the place, idiotic, and had none of the main cast. I think Leslie Grossman is decent- but her character in this was miscast and unbearable to listen to or watch. I have never taken longer and had a harder time getting through a season of AHS.
(give it a 1/10)<br/><br/>I am crossing my fingers that the show starts to go back to how it was before Lange left. It had creative writing, awesome characters, and was an all around a great show. It was so much fun to watch and I anticipated it each week more than I had any other show (besides GOT). It has continued to go downhill with almost every season (since season 4) and if Season 10 is anything like Season 9, I'm out.
Fingers crossed they come up with something worth while again.

1.Asylum (season 2) 8.4/10 This review is based on the whole serie, so my review is based on all seasons, up to the 8th one (Apocalypse)<br/><br/>I follow the show since the beginning, and obviously not every season is brilliant, but overall Ryan Murphy created a nice anthologic show, that is running for almost a decade. Every season is setted in a different historical period and treats different kind of fears, mixed with a lot of gore and graphic scenes. First four season are the best, because there was Jessica Lange, a great actress that portrayed iconic and fascinating characters, such as Sister Jude or Elsa Mars.<br/><br/>Starting from the fifth season (Hotel) Jessica Lange was no longer in the cast and the show started to drop in terms of quality. They tried to create hype in people by putting Lady Gaga in it, but it was not convincing at least for me. She was Elizabeth, one of the most flat and uninteresting character that I ever watched in a show. Luckily for us Evan Peters saved the situation and overall the season was okay. Roanoke, the 6th season, was... watchable, but nothing memorable. I understand that creators were trying to do something different, but honestly a found footage style is a style that I saw many, many times in horror movies.<br/><br/>We had to come to the 7th Season (Cult), to obtain something that was finally interesting. For me this is the season in which Evan Peters really showed how valuable is as an actor. He portrayed many characters along different episodes, and was always on point. I was fascinated about his acting and adaptation skills. By watching interviews related to Cult, you can see how much work he put into this season.<br/><br/>The 8th season began really bad, with the first 2/3 episodes that did not hooked me up. I decided to give it a shot anyway, and in they were able to save it in the end. Apocalypse represent the jump for Cody Fern into the Hollywood and commercial TV world. I liked him as an actor, but, at least for me, he is not at the same level of Evan Peters or even with most of the cast.<br/><br/>It is too soon to give an opinion on the 9th season yet, because, while I am writing this review, 1984 is still airing. I am a little bit scared about the future of the serie: Evan Peters, that was always present in the previous 8 seasons of AHS, announced that this year will be not part of the cast anymore. This is a huge loss for long dated fans like me, because I got used to him and I really enjoyed his acting through different episodes.<br/><br/>Overall, the serie is nice, even with its upside downs, that are inevitable in a long run airing show. Even if every season tells a different story, they are all linked, and this means AHS has his own narrative universe. Also the fact that most of the cast appears in every season, create a deepest bound between the viewer and different characters. If you are a fan of horror genre and supernatural stuff, I highly recommend the show. I wrote a review earlier and unfortunately I neglected to mention the incredible talent in this series.<br/><br/>Props to all of your hard work and dedication. Your talent shines through even the most dull drum writing and directing. The following names with their incredible acting make this series somewhat bearable:<br/><br/>Evan Peters
Sarah Paulson
Denis O'hare
Kathy bates
Francis Conroy
Lily Rabe
Angela Bassett It's odd that this is bunched up into one rather than being able to rate each season. I've been watching AHS from the beginning and have been both satisfied and let down numerous amounts of times. Nothing will compare to Murder House and basically seasons 1-5. Afternoon Roanoke, things went downhill. (I've come to appreciate Roanoke for its definite sense of horror storytelling.) Ryan Murphy obviously started to cast his friends rather than great actors the longer this show was on FX and it's pretty obvious in Cult. Don't even get me started on Apocalypse. Yikes. I'll keep watching because there are pieces I appreciate in every season, but let's only go up from here, okay Murphy?! Each season brings a totally new storyline so if one season is not your 'cup of tea' stick with it. What I felt compelled to review is the absolute masterclass given by Jessica Lange. With an already impressive career, she excels in every role performed and I believe it is her best work. Definitely worth watching just for such a classy lady.
I also have to give kudos to other cast members, particularly Lady GaGa whom I thought was very good. I love horror and this show is especially dark, the performances are great, but the stories are just always a mess. It's too much shock and not enough plot. First two seasons were great, especially the second one, but it all went downhill from there.
Season 1: 8/10
Season 2: 9/10
Season 3: 6/10
Season 4 6/10
Season 5 5/10
I definitely recommend trying the show, but I personally lost interest after season five. If they had only made the Coven series (one of the greatest tv shows of all time) it would have been enough. The other series I can take or leave, though Hotel was pretty great as well. But Coven remains one of the most delightful, delicious, wonderful and hilarious television shows I have ever happily binged. All the actors and characters are brilliant and the storyline will leave you grinning and cheering. I started watching the show when they were finishing the 3rd season. 
I remember when my friend was telling me all about it but i was afraid its gonna be super scary and all but i really liked the idea that its the same actors in every season but its different story every time. I think its such an awesome idea. It shows so much skills of the actors and you get to love them in every way. When i started watching it i loved it from the first season.<br/><br/>I loved pretty much all the seasons and i even rewatched like 3 seasons (and i almost never rewatch stuff) but i absolutely hated the 6th season. The only season i finished watching before the season actually ended. <br/><br/>The new season (The cult) although it only started to be amazing maybe in the middle of it. 
I was watching it with my boyfriend and he said he doesnt like it half way there and after maybe 2 months i finished watching it myself and i was mindblown. This was the american horror story i liked. <br/><br/>The directing, script, editing, cast, everything is just wonderful. <br/><br/>I am still heartbroken that Jessica had left because she was an absolute star! I am not really into Sarah Paulson. there is something with her that just annoys me so much in every season. But i cant give series bad rating just because i dont like one actress especailly since shes a wonderful actress and he doesnt do anything wrong she just annoys me so much for some reason. <br/><br/>Anyway this is one of my favourite shows of all time and i honestly dont get why it gets so much hate and hwo can people not like it. Sure its not scary like a 'horror' should be but i still think its bloody amazing. Reading some of these reviews I am not sure if people understand the concept of horror. Just like any other genre there is more then one kind of horror. Murder House was an old fashion haunted house story but with a twist of the house being known as a "murder house" and having a legend of every owner dying inside the house. The second season which is arguably the best season was called Asylum and is about a 1960s Insane asylum and the people who reside there. This type of horror is more psychological in nature. it is the brand of horror called "psychological thriller" and involves real life torture and serial killers. The third season, Coven, is set in the year 2013, the season follows the dwindling descendants of the witches who survived the Salem Witch Trials and their struggle to hide their identity in the modern world. Even though this season deals a lot with oppression it is largely comedy horror. The Fourth season called Freak Show is set in the year 1952 in the quiet town of Jupiter, Florida, the season follows a struggling freak show and years have passed since people have looked at Freaks shows as a form of entertainment. This season deals a lot with a form of exploitation horror. The fifth season Hotel Set in the year 2015 this season follows the strange and dangerous happenings that seem to center around the retro Hotel Cortez in downtown Los Angeles, California, There is a great deal of mystery horror and deals with vampires, ghosts and serial killers all mixed into one of arguably the most fun seasons. The sixth season Roanoke is again a ghost home invasion storyline but with found footage and reality TV mixed in. And finally (so far at least) Cult which just ended recently and is set in the year 2017 in the fictitious town of Brookfield Heights, Michigan which is left divided upon the wake of Donald Trump's presidential election. Like with Asylum it is mostly psychological thriller dealing with real life issues. All of these types of Horror are valid and some are of course better then others and some I enjoy more then others. My favorite seasons were Asylum, Hotel and Cult mainly because Asylum and Cult were the best written and Hotel was always the most fun but when it comes down to it the only season I didn't enjoy at all was Freak Show. The rest range somewhere between good to awesome. This is definitely a show I would recommend to anyone who likes a good horror story. For over five years now, the FX anthology series "American Horror Story" has been thrilling audiences and gaining popularity with each and every passing season. Utilizing pre-defined sub-genres of horror and thriller, the show is quite a fascinating one, with each new season telling more-or-less a self-contained singular story with only some minor connections and characters bridging the gaps and a recurring cast who continually play new characters each time around. And though it wasn't until very recently that I gave it a fair shot, it's definitely a media franchise I've followed with some degree of interest as a massive fan of all things horror. A fan of everything from "The Shining" to "Saw"... "August Underground" to "Cannibal Holocaust"... Carpenter's "Halloween" to Argento's "Suspiria"... Old camp classics like "House on Haunted Hill" and "Thirteen Ghosts" to modern masterpieces like "The Babadook" and "The Witch"... I'm a horror junkie through- and-through. So I couldn't wait to finally give the series a fair shot.<br/><br/>My thoughts? ...eh. It's alright.<br/><br/>If anything, I'm quite shocked by the ferocity of the fanbase that the series has birthed, and the generally high critical acclaim it's received. Not to say it's bad by any means. Merely decent and entertaining, but obviously troubled. It's a show that's all about that old stand-by of "style over substance", and most episodes I've seen have put all of their focus on merely trying to force a sense of disgust and revulsion with borderline-contrived disturbing imagery and tacky taboo pushing, instead of continually trying to develop and deliver an engaging story with identifiable characters. Which is a shame, because the series is most definitely wickedly entertaining and boasts absolutely stunning production value... and a better focus on story and character would be greatly appreciated. It would elevate it beyond admittedly strong aesthetic thrills and broad entertainment to genuine high quality.<br/><br/>It's hard to discuss that "American Horror Story" as a whole, because each season is sort-of it's own "thing," but I will say for sure that one of the great strengths of the series is the fact that due to its anthology-nature, it makes certain flaws easier to forgive. One season really doesn't float your boat? Well, try the next one, since it'll be a brand new tale! Not a fan of a recurring guest star? Check out one of the other seasons where they don't appear! And so on. For my money (and based on the episodes I've seen, which admittedly aren't all of them), I'd probably put the first two seasons ("Murder House" and "Asylum") at the top of my "best of" list, but I'm sure there will be people who prefer other seasons like "Hotel" or "Freak Show."<br/><br/>Your appreciation of the series is really down to personal tastes in your choice of horror. Series creators Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk definitely seem to have a taste for schlock-tastic, ooey-gooey exploitation based on the overall tone and style they build. And though each season sort-of has its own unique spin, the push for the "extreme" is a recurring motif throughout each season. And I think that's why, for me at least, it's never once been truly frightening or scary. Which is a pretty big issue for a series built around horror. There's just a bit too much lack in atmosphere building and a bit too much push for increasingly insane visuals and concepts that I find myself losing investment in the scares all too often. And as a result, I find the show sometimes oddly boring despite the loud music stingers and grotesque monstrosities on display.<br/><br/>It comes down to this. "American Horror Story" is often entertaining, and the completely insane things the writers and directors cook up will likely be more than enough to captivate many viewers. It's definitely a wild ride, and there's a lot of fun to be had. Heck, I didn't even get around to mentioning the exquisite cast including everyone from the fantastic Evan Peters to icons like Jessica Lange and modern-day superstar Lady Gaga. But it's not particularly deep or complex. It lacks coherency at times and is more concerned with gore than brains. It's decent "popcorn horror." But nothing more.<br/><br/>I give it a slightly above average 6 out of 10. American Horror Story used to be one of my all-time favorite series when it first aired. The first season was so unexpectedly good and had so much to offer (especially since there weren't any good Horror series out there at that time. And the demand was clearly there). Season 2 (Asylum) was a pleasant surprise. Instead of continuing the story from the previous season a whole new story was introduced. The cast remained mostly the same but they all assumed new roles. This was both unexpected and pleasantly surprising since I got really used to the lovely cast. It was also a clear statement that every season is supposed to explore a different kind of horror story, with different paradigms and struggles. But even though the stories/seasons were so different from one another I couldn't help but notice minor "coincidences" which I deemed to be carefully planted Easter eggs that somehow held the stories together. <br/><br/>I totally loved the first 3 seasons but since the introduction of season 4 and what followed thereafter it felt like the writers ran out of creative juices. I didn't get the same excitement anymore and the stories really weren't all that scary or compelling anymore (season 5 is an exception: it was scary but lacked in other departments). Much to my dismay. I am almost entirely certain that this downward trend is going to continue. The writers seem to have lost touch with their fanbase. <br/><br/>When I watched Season 6 I was utterly disappointed. I somehow assumed that since the last two seasons were subpar this season might be a U-turn in the right direction. It wasn't. They just rehashed an already explored concept (witches) with a "twist" (if you can even call it that. I'm not going into more details because I don't want to spoil the season for you). I thought it was lazy storytelling to be perfectly honest with you. The acting on the other hand was really good but still... they pretty much ruined the series at this point. And I'm not being melodramatic here. From the looks of it they are just pumping out seasons for the sake of it. I have to say I am loving this Roanoke Nightmare! It's so much fun watching the story about the story, then the reality show about the reality show - it's so deliciously convoluted! It is great to see all the familiar faces playing different roles! Can't wait to see the next episode!<br/><br/>Horror has never been my thing, the only reason I tuned into AHS was Lady Gaga, and then I began to see why the show had won Emmy Awards, a decided to watch Seasons 1-4. And now this, those hillbillies crack me up! The backstory is plausible. The blood moon theme is fun. The cast and crew have really outdone themselves! I loved this show since its self title debut. The first season was so awesome. It only got better as it continued. I also like how they keep a handful of the cast members. This way they get used to acting and working with each other on a very close level. It is a great anthology horror that offers different stories and events. It definitely keeps things from dragging out and becoming too over the top, like so many shows after 12 seasons. This also keeps things interesting. There is nothing better than a new story each season.<br/><br/>I personally love this show because of its deep detail to story. The show definitely holds nothing back, and gives me the sense of "that's totally nuts, but believe me, it's among us" type feeling. This draws a sincerity to the characters, and makes things a lot more believable and not so sugar coated, like most shows. <br/><br/>There's always a surprise in store with AHS. The current season, "My Roanoke Nightmare," started out as a documentary. Everyone didn't grasp it and thought it was the end. THEN WAIT! It take a drastic turn and switches to the actual people that the actors reality show was supposed to be acting out as. So, never stop watching. This show will never go bad. I will almost guarantee it. It's one of the best in existence. <br/><br/>You can't really write a detailed review on AHS. If you're a horror fan, you will love it. Hands down, final answer! You have to watch it. Everyone interprets it in a different, but positive way. First of all I want to congratulate Jamie Brewer on her fantastic performance! Truly the highlight of what I watched if this series, it was very meaningful for me. <br/><br/>Unfortunately by episode 5 I found the series falling apart for me as I started losing respect for one is the main characters. In episode 5, an event occurs after which I could no longer respect him and lost all desire to continue watching. Horror has to be done artfully, otherwise it just becomes sickening and it no longer matters to the what happens next because the story line has lost any value. <br/><br/>I gave it a 5 star rating because I really want to give Ms Brewer a 10 and the series as a whole 2. I loved the first three seasons - they were innovative, uncanny, thrilling. The story lines were daring, especially for a TV series and if examined closely, provided ample food for thought. Season four lost some of its charm, yet it had its moments. I am massively disappointed by season 5 however. What passes as acting in some of the episodes is beneath contempt. Kathy Bates is the only actress that remains consistent however even she can't carry the dead weight of some of her costars. The writing has lost its edge and became cliché ridden, the characters are elusive and unappealing. There is no story in particular that holds any interest. The series wholly relies on shock value and its undemanding audience. What a shame! I've been watching American horror story for 2 years now, and i have to say i never get bored of it! every season is a new story which can keep all views watching to find out what's it going to happen next. Even non-horror fans can find enjoyment in the show. The seasons are all different stories,character,setting etc. Which i really like. iv'e never came across with a show with this type of format. My favourite season is Asylum. But i really did like Hotel this year as well, i never knew Lady Gaga could act as well as she did!. All the actors are excellent, very method, changing character every season must be hard but they do it well. I would say the show isn't scream out loud horror but it can be jumpy a few times, as the seasons continue, i hope they don't loose the horror element. But i recommend American Horror Story to people who like horror or don't like horror their is still enjoyment to be had. I really love the series. It is a brilliant, a sick, an appropriate length series. I love the actors too. My favorites actors are Evan Peters, Jessica Lange, Sarah Paulson, Lily Rabe and Zachary Quinto. Unfortunately Zachary Quinto left the series :( My favorite season is the second. The second season is so, so sick, thought-provoking, exciting, and little funny. I really really love the actors in the first, second, third season. The first season is the realist season in the series. The second season is the scariest maybe... but the third season is a little bit weaker than the other season, but I really loved it too. I'm love with this sick series... I recommend to everyone this series. 10/10. I am a fan of the show. I have seen four seasons so far. I watch it because the ensemble cast is remarkably talented. I watch it because the production values are exquisite. I also watch it because it is available on Netflix without commercials. <br/><br/>The fourth season, "Freak Show", took some perseverance for me to watch from the beginning. I grew up in the 1950's, and a yearly traveling circus/carnival came to my hometown with some elements of a real freak show. Experiencing that environment first hand left its mark on my psyche. I can still see the tawdry tents and smell the rank odors. <br/><br/>The series has been a wonderful showcase for Jessica Lange. Her Elsa Mars is iconic. It wraps up the Dietrich personalities of the 1950's brilliantly. Lange's scenes are hypnotic. Kathy Bates, Frances Conroy and Angela Bassett, Sarah Paulson and Denis O'Hare are no lightweights. So, the cast is deep with rich performances in every episode. Finn Wittrock's Dandy Mott rivals the best performances of young Jim Carrey. <br/><br/>The one flaw in "Freak Show" is some writing in some episodes. The second episode was particularly below par. Some use of flashback or fantasy was confusing as well. While visually intriguing these elements were executed sloppily. Maybe it was the editing.<br/><br/>Great show. Worth watching still. It tackles subjects which are taboo with admirable disregard of political correctness. That alone sets it apart from massive television mediocrity. Season one is phenomenal! It's one of them shows that shocks you! And I adore that! Everything about the show is perfecta apart from one thing.... It didn't scare me in the slightest! I found it disturbing in parts but scary?!? Not at all.<br/><br/>Season two... That series (asylum) did freak me out" the first Time I watched it! It's amazing because the time era "gave them an excuse" to torcher their so called insane inmates! I did have the odd nightmare about briarcliff! I have watched series 2 3times now and I don't have to look through my fingers anymore! The intensity of the show is what I long for in every programme that's shown nower days!! Series three had some horrific moments with Katy bates! (An amazing actress who played an awful horrific racist) to the hilt! She was the shining star of Series3! In general the series was mediocre compared to the previous ones!<br/><br/>Series four: Freak show.... For me that was the series that broke down my facade, that damn clown was horrendous!!! It's months and months later and I still have nightmares about that clown!!! They certainly did their job in scaring the hell out of me!!!! The story behind it all may have been poignant but that clown is the one thing that will always terrify me!!!! I a,most stopped watching the show coz the clown scared me that much! Sooooo glad I stuck it out!!! Keeps getting better and better!!! I absolutely LOVED the show from the start. The characters had just the right amount of creepiness and drama, plus the guest stars were amazing. Murder house was very well thought out and I loved it. Asylum was even better- there were plot twists that left me waiting on the edge of my seat. Coven was great, Jamie Brewer did amazing in this season (she's always been great, though). And then Freak show came along. I was so excited- that is until I actually watched it. It was by far the worst season in the series.<br/><br/>Murder House- 9/10 Asylum- 10/10 Coven- 8/10 Freak Show- 7/10 Over All- 8/10 This Drama / Horror / Thriller television series is simply unique. Most TV shows have one story line, and that story line lasts throughout every season, beginning to the end. American Horror Story, however, is completely different. Each season has a different story line. Although, there are minor connections from certain seasons to the other. <br/><br/>Even though there's a different story each season, the main characters are usually played by the same actors, and same goes for the supporting actors. I feel like the actors they chose for the parts were great picks, and played their parts well. Jessica Lange, Sarah Paulson and Evan Peters all played their characters excellently. It's a shame that Jessica Lange will no longer be apart of American Horror Story, starting the fifth season, but a new star, Lady Gaga, will be taking her place.<br/><br/>American Horror Story is based on physical and mental terrors that affect a deteriorating family, employees and patients of a mental institution, a circle of witches, and a cast of freaks that are faced with challenges such as adultery, mental health, oppression, and discrimination. <br/><br/>The costume designs and choices of clothing fit the style of each season. Especially in season four, "Freak show". The scores and soundtrack go perfectly with the tone of the show, creepy and suspenseful. The show moved smoothly from scene to scene, and the ambient effects along with lighting was mostly on point. The set designs looked real, and the plots of each season were inevitable and unpredictable. <br/><br/>However, there were certain scenes in this show that I believe were a little unnecessary, like the ending to season four. I also thought there were scenes that didn't really relate to the plots that could've been left out, like a few scenes in season two. I also felt that there were some unanswered questions about certain things relating to the plot. <br/><br/>Overall, I think this show is very worth watching, and I highly recommend watching it, if you're into scary and creepy things. One of the best series about a haunted house i have ever seen, love it. You want to see the next episode. The writing of the series is superb and the actors are great. Love this series :-) I am watching the first season now. Jessica Lange is great with her Southern accent. Very good is the interaction between the dead people who died in the house and the still living. Also it is great how men see the character of Moira, they see a hot trashy lady and in fact she is a middle aged woman. Love the series, the house the actors, everything. I am watching the show on Netflix so that's very great you can watch whenever you have time to watch. in my opinion American Horror Story is based very much around sex and drugs. on the upper hand AHS has come far in popularity around the world. i am currently watching season three; coven (again) and i am once again enjoying it. the thing that captured my attention towards the show was the fact that they always had the same actors and actresses. Evan Peters did an amazing job portraying four different characters with four very different stories and personalities. American Horror Story is very well set up in that way. the fact that each season is a new story with new characters and a new plot really intrigued me into watching it. all around good show, cant wait for season 5! A fourth season of anthology horror series featuring the bizarre life of freaks at the show run by Elsa Mars (Jessica Lange). Comparing to other seasons, this one is far from being the best one due to its storyline that doesn't seem to go anywhere and seems more like an explanation to each character's background and how they ended up here. Nonetheless, the characters are probably the strongest point in this series as they are very interesting and unique to look like and they all delivers a great performance that makes you actually cares for them. The notable characters here are probably Dandy (Finn Wittrock) with his immature psychotic character that can easily steals the show along with Jessica Lange as Elsa Mars who we will always love to hate, and Sarah Paulson as Bette and Dot which I think she really nails her role this season and even some likable ones like La Petite, Twisty the Clown, and Pepper also brings this show more to live. Another good thing about this is like we got to see familiar faces and a link to previous season, Asylum which is very well connected there. For the pacing, the show starts being everything, scary, gory, funny, and even musical that's really appealing and an excellent way to start a series. But all this seems to fade away as the story goes, even though we get to see more characters coming up but the story is just going nowhere and feels like the writers are just throwing in new plot each episode as it goes instead of trying to smoothly connect them with a clear purpose, plus the musical parts are overused sometimes as well. The best episode is probably the one featuring Twisty The Clown as this quickly becomes fan's favorite character due to its unique, scary, yet empathetic clown character and another is the one featuring how Pepper ended up in Asylum which, I dare to admit that it's the only show that actually made me cried this year. Overall, this season benefits largely from its highly appealing characters and strong performances especially from Jessica Lange, Kathy Bates, and Sarah Paulson with a pull back by its scattered plot that can easily loses audience as the story goes, but still one hell of a bloody ride for horror fans nonetheless. <br/><br/>>>B+<< It's definitely one of the better shows that's come out in the past few years. The season are pretty short and easy to follow. Around 10 episodes each and they're available on Netflix or other party sites. Except for season 2 maybe.. Each one is an entirely different concept. The first year deals with a family moving into a haunted house, the second deals with a journalist uncovering abuse in an insane asylum..etc. Other than that the show is a little bit campy, no matter how grotesque it can get. It reminds me a lot of scream. Even when the characters die off. The past two seasons seam to incorporate a lot of humor and pop culture references. Season 2 was a little slow, and I hope they never try to mix in that many story lines like that ever again. Otherwise, it's great. You'll love the show. Give it a chance! The first two seasons were sublime, but for me, season 3 went a bit Harry Potter meets Buffy.<br/><br/>Jessica Lange is without doubt the asset of this now established tales from the crypt style franchise. There is a slight old school horror feel about these series which I like, it is not too clichéd and does not stray from it's genre.<br/><br/>Does a remarkable job in making you warm to the characters, but not so much that it interferes with the twists and turns of the plot.<br/><br/>Re-cycling the cast was something we saw a lot of back in the 60's and 70's which is refreshing to see again. Nowadays movies and shows try to be too different for their own good, this show sticks to a format that works, but even so American Horror Story is original in part, and well crafted in the whole. I haven't seen any of the first two series of AHS but I've seen Coven and I thought it was amazing. It was action and drama packed with horror. Kathy Bates and Jessica Lange really took the spotlight with their very powerful roles as Fiona(Jessica Lange) and Madame Delphine LaLaurie( Kathy Bates), a terrible woman who back in the 19th century used to torture black men in her attic. One of my favourite character was Kyle Spencer. A boy that died in a bus "accident" after a party and was brought back to life by Maddison(Emma Roberts) and his cute admirer Zoe(Taissa Farmiga), he then falls in love with Zoe and Madison.<br/><br/>This is all I am going to tell you because I don't want to spoil to much. I'm very disappointed in this season.
it's extremely cheesy slasher long movie divided into 9 episodes.
I doubt that anyone involve in writing this season made any effort of creativity.
such a waste of time, money & talent. This series is getting worse and worse, 1 season was good, every other season bad bad bad.. cult and apocalypse laughable..
how can this go on? Seriously.. *looool Yet again this series has just lost the plot , bad script, awful acting yet again ,might aswell watch a tin of red paint filmed in the dark This (S8 - Apocalypse) was the worst season for me. For those who love a teenage drama (every other netflix series) this could be great but for me it was so bad.
1. Voodoo is the most stupid thing I have ever seen. You make a wish and you have to "pay" for it and the payment is literally 0. Their payment wasnt their life or life of someone dear to them, it was the life of someone they hated. To me that sounds like a great deal, not only is it a free wish its also a bit extra because someone you wanted dead is being punished. They made voodoo too strong and ruined some scenes with that.
2.The fat black witch (forgot her name) doesnt go to hotel Cortez so she never gets eaten and because of that the black vampire lady doesnt get stronger.
3.It was so boring to watch when you know everyone just get back to life because of their powers, nothing to shock you.
4. World in total chaos, people fighting to survive in that hell would be so fun to watch instead of teen drama and listening to the word "bitch" and "badass bitch" 50times per episode. Its fun and cool to have a badass women for some cool moments but it gets so frustrating that you have to listen to the word "bitch" every scene, losing all that empowerment that you originaly gave those characters (female ones that could have been made one of best badass female groups turned into women that act like kids)
5. Warlocks are useless, they are literally not important at all in the world because witches are made really op while warlocks are weak and that results again in no "shock effect".
6. It just doesnt matter. The whole season is useless, most things that happened arent even important and the spawn of satan cries for 10 episodes, doesnt show any real power (illuminati did his biggest work) and dies to a range rover. AHS is my first TV show and I was really enjoying it at first, calling it the best show ever even tho it was my first and only one, until I watched shows like Breaking Bad, Narcos, Money Heist and more. Then, I realised this is a BIG waste of time. Go watch something else, this show is really a joke. The clown of the class. And let's not even think about the fact that the story is different in every season tho they are using the SAME actors for different characters. I absolutely hate the horror genre but for some reason American Horror Story breaks that stereotype of cliché, nonsensical gory cinema. Everything about this show is incredible. The cast is talented and diverse in acting skills, the plot lines are gripping and intriguing and the cinematography is excellent and who can't love those introduction titles? When I first started watching the show, I was really intrigued to learn that every season is a new horror story, and with each progressive season, the stores get better and better than the last. I don't believe many TV shows do this and it provides an interesting challenge for the cast and scriptwriters. Speaking of scriptwriters, the writing is excellent. I was surprised to find out that one of the co- creators of the show was also a writer or a creator of Glee. Words cannot describe the viewing experience for American Horror Story, if you're on the fence watch an episode and find out for yourself! The edge of my sofa is worn out by my sitting here each week watching the new episode of American Horror Story. Taking a break every fifteen minutes or so, to catch my breath, has become a part of the experience. Every twist and turn draws me in deeper and deeper and each episode comes to an end too quickly, leaving me wanting more. The characters are real, the settings are impeccable and the acting outstanding. Not a program for children or those who have a low tolerance for the macabre. American Horror Story is for those who love horror fantasy with graphic detail. There is nothing like it on television or any other media. Keep up the horror, the intrigue and the intelligent humor. I love this series and I am a dedicated fan. Great job..... First I should start by saying that while I do rely heavily on customer reviews, I hardly ever write any myself. Second, I am a VERY picky viewer and I have a hard time getting hooked on TV shows. American Horror Story was just something I happened upon in ITunes while I was looking for shows to watch...I'm 34 weeks pregnant and on bed rest so I'm desperately looking for books, shows, and movies to pass the time. With AHS, I bought the pilot and as soon as the pilot ended I immediately purchased the entire season. I cannot remember the last show that hooked me as fast as this one did- oh actually I take that back- i do remember and it was Breaking Bad. In American Horror Story I find the acting fantastic, the stories are weird, a little tense at times, and I find them to be very intriguing as they keep me on my toes. I just really really love this show!! I just started watching it yesterday and now am almost finished the entire first season. I highly recommend giving it a chance---I know we all have different taste but I feel like with how picky I am about the shows I watch, the fact that I love it says a lot! Being suddenly slapped in the face with McDermott's butt.<br/><br/>Have now officially seen more of him, than expected or wanted to in this lifetime.<br/><br/>If you must have nude rears, please let it be Breckenridge.<br/><br/>Oh, the show was bad too.<br/><br/>Guess that's a good thing, considering it's horror.<br/><br/>No saccharin sweet family with the oh cho chweet little kid.<br/><br/>They look good.<br/><br/>Good from far, far from good. <br/><br/>Turn out to be ugly people once you get close enough.<br/><br/>Creepy house, creepy neighbours and creepy hot housekeeper.<br/><br/>Cliché ridden but still managed to be slightly different. <br/><br/>Just cannot claim to be scared by this and still call yourself a horror fan.<br/><br/>Thrill and chills are that stale. <br/><br/>It's the characters that are offensive.<br/><br/>Instead of stomach being turned by more hackneyed cgi, hackles get raised by Jessica telling a complete stranger that she missed out on aborting the 'mongloid' because the tests hadn't been developed yet. <br/><br/>Can't glorify it by calling it irreverent.<br/><br/>Just nasty.<br/><br/>Which unfortunately makes it watchable.<br/><br/>Being a better person will have to wait, want to see what happens next. <br/><br/>Wish them well.<br/><br/>Thank you.<br/><br/>Wow. Went downhill fast.<br/><br/>2nd episode - drag more disposable characters down to the basement.<br/><br/>3rd episode - kill another disposable character. Build gazebo while emo chick wails in background. <br/><br/>Sorry Breckenridge, even the phenomenal rear view could not save this.<br/><br/>Suspense and creepiness was all they had and that is long gone. <br/><br/>Only horror now, is how bad can this possibly get.<br/><br/>Save your time and attention for walking dead while Darabont's touch is still visible. CHEESY!!!!! Atleast the the first episode had great characters and story line. Season 9 was just chop people up and bad acting... so so so stupid! I only love the Lady Gaga's sex scene, it's so sexy I really liked the point that Murphy is trying to make.Some people may find it too far and unrealistic considering the scenes with peter Evans but that's how it is.I'm glad that a show dares to make thing appear how they really are and awaken people about what's going on with trump and America.But i find the script a little boring and irritating especially the clown scenes.What's going on with the murders in the neighbours' house..Why would clowns do that.It would be more thrilling if the clowns were actual human beings murdering and scaring people.But the whole situation with the clowns-ghosts is too much even for ash.Maybe they are in their imagination..We will see.Maybe it's too soon to judge but so far i don't find it entertaining enough. Season 1 Murder House was amazing. Season 2: Asylum was even better. This is a horror anthology for people who love all kinds of horror. Season 1: was set in a haunted house and told the story of the Harmons; a fractured family who moved across country thinking it was a fresh start only to find themselves living in the most haunted house in America and being haunted by the former residents both living and dead. Season 2 is set in a 1960's insane asylum and is focused around a wrongly committed reporter and a young man who may or may not be responsible for a string of murders. Both seasons tell separate stories so you know you won't be left hanging with incomplete story lines. Both seasons all the actors did well. In season 1 the standout performers were Evan Peters as Tate and of course Jessica Lange as Constance. In Season 2 Jessica Lange again was stand out as Sister Jude but the real stand outs were Lily Rabe as the demon possessed Sister Mary Eunice and Sarah Paulson as Lana Winters. I enjoyed season 2 more than season 1 but they were both fantastic and this show has become one of my favorites in years. A mean spirited show, don't watch it; don't let your kids see it. In my opinion Freakshow, Cult, Asylum, Hotel, and Apocalypse are the best seasons! I've loved American Horror Story since it only had a couple seasons. So many great stories, well acted, disturbing greatness, and well written dialogue. I'm always intrigued by other opinions of who likes what the best and the various reasons; cool how my mom got me into AHS 8 years ago and now she's barely a fan while I still love every bit. Epic how the last 3 seasons finally have the F bomb in it unlike the first 6 years worth were only TV-MA for the horror violence and sexual content - I want more profanity!! Oh my gosh. Ignore every bad comment about this show... American Horror Story is the complete definition of beautiful television. Each Season is self contained with a cast so spectacular, that its hard not to watch. E.g. Season 5: Hotel- Lady Gaga plays the vampire 'Countess' and absolutely nailed the role. Every single season of this show brings joy to me, the producers manage to capture factual elements of 'horror' in this show for everyone's enjoyment. With American Horror Story, you can start at any season- because each season is its own separate story and characters- through there are pretty exciting season connections along the way. The character development is so well done- we learn all their back stories, qualities and traits throughout the season, enabling us to connect with them. Oh how I could type this review till my PC runs out of battery... Season 2 (Asylum) is definitely my favorite season so far. Thank you American Horror Story, for sucking me into a world of art, creativity and never-ending excitement. For those thinking its scary, its not, though some parts are a bit disturbing e.g. Twisty the killer clown in Season 4 (Freak show) But overall... This is my #1 favorite show of all time. I recommend it to EVERYONE! American Horror Story is sheer beauty in my eyes, a true classic work of art!!! I like how they slowly connect everything in the series. That's why season 8 is my favorite because it combines Hotel, Coven, and Murder House. The biggest question I have for this show is how is it going to end. What to say? Every season is beautifully original, loved asylum, freak show and hotel.
The characters are fantastically written and the actors are super talented to portray such unique and wonderful images of horror!
Every season brings excitement for me to tune in and enjoy Some seasons are amazing. Some mediocre. And some damn horrible. I could not watch the cult season. I barely got through the Roanoke season. Season 1-5, were great. Apocalypse was meh,okayish?some episodes good, some not so much.
I like the fact that some of these seasons do overlap. Angela Bassett, Kathy Bates, Jessica Lange, Evan Peters, Lady Gaga, Sarah Paulson, Denis O'Hare and more all great! They make you love them, hate them, every emotion in one. If you want to watch the great seasons, stick to 1-5 for now. I have enjoyed every single season. Lost a bit of interest in Cult to begin with but still enjoyed it!<br/><br/>For several years now people have been recommending watching this show to me and for one reason or another I just didn't want to. I attempted episode one of murder house and it just didn't pull me in to be honest. I wish I had just stuck with it and watched a couple more episodes because I'm booked and I don't know what to do with myself now I've finished all (current) series! To anyone considering it, just stick with it as it is definitely worth it!<br/><br/>My personal list from best to worst:
Coven
Roanoke
Asylum
Murder House
Hotel
Apocalypse
Freak Show
Cult American Horror Story is interesting, entertaining, suspenseful, and ambitious.
9/10 This show takes horror to a whole new level. They aren't afraid to "go there". Nothing is off limits in this twisted drama. Each season is it's own story. I've never been disappointed when watching AHS. Every season has new cast members, along with some regulars you grow to love. Every time I reach for the remote and turn this on I am stunned by the one aspect of it that never fails to take my breath away. Stunning artwork. Majestic. But enough about me. The one overlooked, underapreciated aspect of this show ....what stops me from ending it all....Zachary .Quinto's. Eyebrows.<br/><br/>Need I say more? watch this, if only for this reason. I have never seen actors so far on their A game. The directors made this series a masterpiece. The cinematography was spot on. I love how they twist the stories and centuries. Why do long. Circle after circle of the same thing This show is very creative and unique, I will be very sad if Ryan Murphy decides to let it go.<br/><br/>For me all the seasons offer something new and the acting is always top notch. I would avoid reading people's negative views about a particular season, because so many people in reality have different tastes.<br/><br/>The show is a lot better if binge watched, it stops you from overthinking. Each season could have gone down so many different paths, and it is important to note that just because Ryan Murphy chose a certain path doesn't mean that particular season is bad. <br/><br/>My personal opinion <br/><br/>Murder House: 8/10 classic season, hope that some of the actors return in the near future<br/><br/>Asylum: 9/10, Best season, great premise and tackles a lot of issues.<br/><br/>Coven: 7/10, This is the dark comedic season. <br/><br/>Freak Show: 3/10, my opinion sorry the only season I didn't enjoy too much, but some people love this season so don't let me put you off<br/><br/>Hotel: 6/10 Not much to say about this one, just that it is good but not amazing.<br/><br/>Roanoke: 8/10 My personal favourite season (even though Asylum is better this one is better to re-watch). Many people disliked this season however, but I've never really understood why because the story and acting is amazing.<br/><br/>Cult: 10/10 I have to say this season is very thrilling, it starts off slow but everything is eventually explained in later episodes and it is turning out to be the best season. Even without many of the amazing actors from previous seasons. <br/><br/>Overall, this show gets an 8/10, each season is unique and caters to different people and their own personal tastes. Hence there is a lot of conflict over which seasons are actually good or not. I am an on again off again fan of this show and this season from what I have seen here this may be a season I actually watch the entire season you just can since the presence of horror here and its so classic scary you cant go wrong really watching this season expesually I am loving the whole clown thing too very creative a clown cult never heard of that one before so thoughtful I will stay around this season and you should too Why is AHS awesome? 1. Jessica Lange! 2. The stories are creepy and well written (especially season 3). 3. The ensemble cast that gets a new character each season with a new story line! There is nothing else like this. This show really gives you an idea of what a talented actor can do. They are given a new character each season with a new story and they pull it off (some better than others)--Jessica Lange, Sarah Paulsen, Kathy Bates, Lily Rabe, Frances Conroy, & Finn Wittrock just to name a few. I deducted 2 stars because of the sex scenes. Ryan and Brad....what would your mother say?! I always knew this show would be great ever since it came out. I really have no complaints about it, but here's my personal opinion. I never had a favorite or a least favorite. Reason being is because they were all diff. Some seasons were scary, or sorta funny and always kept my interest because they would never show a glimpse of a villain and made u wonder the mystery till last couple episodes. I'm very impressed the show could get away with so much gore, sex and complete weirdness on FX. Everyone has a right to an opinion but I hate when people bash any of the seasons because it really takes an intelligent person to come up with all this off the wall stuff. I wish it was scarier, for all season. Some seasons were really creepy. But let's be honest, the creepier, weirder more gore, sex is what people are interested in, and American horror story definitely had at least all or a few of those characteristics in the show. If it were up to me, I think HBO should buy out this show so it an be rated R. Man this show would rock and be way more interesting, because like I said everyone is interested in the weirder and scarier stuff. Makes it interesting, my imagination flourishes. Hard for me to rate as a whole, but if it was rated R I would have it a 11 if there was an option. AHS, make your show creepier everyone wants that. I'd like to hear everyone's comment on mine, because I think I have a very good point about the show. I think everyone can agree that the show would be so much better having creepier, sex, craziness off the wall indescribable things. But my biggest complaint is usually season finale it never really says what happens, and. Hate my imagination to think because I know it's not right or wrong but I feel closure when the show has it their way. Just saying. Please I love hearing about other opinions based on my opinion. **POSSIBLE SPOILERS** This show is really good. The acting is superb and the storyline is absolutely gripping. All the seasons are really nice with each having a new storyline with new characters. Although said as an anthology series,IT'S not entirely anthological because some characters from previous season do return JLange does a really good job in all the seasons (she does not appear in the 5th). But my favourites are Lily Rabe,Sarah Paulson,Evan Peters and Denis O'Hare. Angela Basett and Kathy Bates are good too. I really recommend this series if you like anything out of ordinary. The fifth season is running now and I think Lady Gaga has done a fantastic job. She,of course should not be compared to JLange but she's a budding actress and I would love to see more of her in later seasons.(But not more than JLange.) My only regret is not watching this show sooner. I had quite a few people recommend it to me, but horror isn't typically my genre, or so I thought, so I put it off. It's not what I expected at all for something with "Horror" in the title. While it does deliver fear, it does so in a way that focuses more on suspense and plot and showcasing the idea that humanity is both capable of evil and of overcoming evil. I've seen 3 seasons now and absolutely love this show and can't wait to watch the rest of the seasons.<br/><br/>Even though the subject matter gets dark and there are gory scenes, there is a very heavy emphasis on plot over the horror and gore aspects of the show so much so that the minor details that don't necessarily make sense are able to be overlooked as "eh, it's fiction". <br/><br/>The real "horror" they focus on is that humanity has nothing to be afraid of except for what we create for ourselves. I'm not so much into the gore as I am into the plot lines and the depth of the characters and the fact that this show does such an excellent job of highlighting the problems in the world that still need to change. Sexism against both men and women, racism, homophobia, murder, repression, rape, torture, ethics, honesty, our focus on looks over personality, the way we view sex as a society, etc. etc. It goes much deeper into these topics than you might expect for a "horror" show and that is what makes this show so great. It's ability to showcase humanity's capacity for evil and really highlight just how backwards humanity has been in the past and still is today. when you think of the first season you instantly think of a troubled family that moves into an old house and start getting haunted by ghosts, this is what the first season consisted off but Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk completely pulled it off by bringing its own original twist which made it so unique, it was addictive, sexy and it was so great to see some character developments For example Tate. <br/><br/>The Second season entitled Asylum was far more extraordinary than before, it was full of twisted plots Demonic possessions and really drove me insane! the characters were well developed as the season progressed such as Sister Jude and The monsignor Timothy, this season was a complete success in my eyes. <br/><br/>The Third instalment entitled Coven wasn't exactly up to usual AHS standards in terms of horror, but it did introduce the new style of AHS, there were very funny moments and most characters were very developed and had an individual role, some nice references to Mme Lalaurie and Marie laveau. <br/><br/>Freak Show, the fourth season, was promised to be dark, which it started of as, which was brilliant, however it did not have a central plot which was disappointing and the seasons relevancy disintegrated after say the 8th episode. <br/><br/>Finally hotel is well: Gory, sexual in many levels and often very disturbing, it has a wide range of characters with fascinating back stories such as Gaga's very own Elizabeth Johnson (The Countess) a woman infected by an ancient blood virus. The hotel is a great symbol of addiction as shown with the addiction demon, a chilling presence in itself which demonstrates the suffering people face during their fight with any kind of addiction. This season is very dark much like season 2 but in my opinion is not as strong in terms of a central plot but there are great performances from Evan Peters as Mr James Patrick March, the founder of the hotel cortez and from Sarah Paulson who plays Sally, more commonly known by fans as Hypodermic Sally whom is a drug addict and can control the addiction demon and has a peculiar but racy relationship with Detective John Lowe (Wes Bentley) who is drawn to the hotel in order to investigate the Ten Commandment killings. Overall this show is a must for over 15's in my opinion as it tackles everyday horror's and ones that are best kept hidden. Now this is a nice concept. Every new season another story with almost all the same actors. I thought the second season would be just a continuing of the first season but it wasn't. Every season is completely different and some stories are just better then others. To me season two (Asylum) was the best one, followed by season one (Murder House), then season three (Coven), and finally season four (Freak Show). I am already curious what they will come up with for season five. It's difficult to review all the actors because in every season they have other bigger or minor roles but to me Jessica Lange is the star of the whole show. Other actors that I really enjoyed watching are Lily Rabe, Evan Peters, Sarah Paulson, Kathy Bates and Denis O'hare. The other actors gave also a good performance. Overall I think the cast was very well chosen for every different story. Certainly a must watch to me. Looking forward to season five. Minor spoilers: I really enjoyed the first 2 seasons of American horror story and thought this show was going to be one of my favorites. Unfortunately season 3 and 4 are terrible, season 4 is about half way through at this point and I gotta say this shows just worse every episode.<br/><br/>Season 3 besides having a boring no real thrill story it had Stevy Nicks trying to sing and that was awful, why would you put a 5 minute Stevy Nicks solo in your show for the hell of it? Shes old and can't sing anymore that was just embarrassing.<br/><br/>Season 4 they had something cool going then abruptly end it and are left with nothing of interest. Now we have Jessica Lange singing and the guy that played Vic Macky coming out of the closet in a freak show? Come on this is getting stupid.<br/><br/>Could this show potentially get back on track? Since each season is unique I would hope so but at this point I'm pretty turned off and uninterested. The series is stupid and badly written every episode keeps jumping from one thing other (never explained). The ghost of a serial killer, The Axeman (who also a creep) is obsess with Jessica Lange's character since she was eight-year-old in the school. He was killed by a group of vigilante girl witches in 1919 The story goes nowhere except for last few episodes. When I watch it first time it's a mixed of Tales from the Crypt and Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?. The characters are unlikable of the two character's Lange's daughter and Gabourney Sidibe are the only one who have any sense. The season is about who will be the next supreme, Jessica Lange's character is dying and losing her powers and she plots to killed the four teenage girls including her grown daughter. The show is weird and stupid; and has a crazy opening. The three actress that made the season work are Kathy Bates, Angela Bassett, and Emma Roberts. American Horror Story is absolutely amazing. It is well thought out and very well acted and is an overall good show. It is very entertaining and is an absolute catch. It will grab your attention from the moment it starts. Whether you like drama, horror, or romance this show has the perfect mix. It definitely has some heart-pulling moments and is also very scary at times. The creators of this show definitely knew what they were doing when they wrote it. They know exactly how to give you a love-hate feeling for every character and they are great at making you empathize with the characters. This show is immaculate and deserves all the credit it gets and more. I strongly suggest this to anyone who is interested I'm watching. Don't hesitate if you're scared, it can get scary at times but it is usually predictable when something creepy will happen, so just turn the lights on and out your blanket to your face and you're good. For horror lovers, this is perfect for you. Again I strongly praise this show. It is a definite must-watch and the first two seasons are on netflix now, so GO WATCH IT! Absolutely brilliant. American Horror Story is unlike any horror show that is on TV at the moment. Each season follows a different story line and setting. They do recycle the actors and characters each season so it does not matter if you pick up watching the show at any time.<br/><br/>The first season is titled American Horror Story Murder house which follows a family who have moved into a house with a history, the history is in the title. The second season titled American Horror Story Asylum follows the grizzly comings and goings of an insane asylum in the 1960's. The Third season Titled American Horror story Coven is set in New Orleans and follows a coven of young witches. The fourth season which is due to air in 2015 is titled Freak Show and will be set in a 1950's carnival.<br/><br/>The performances of the actors particularly Jessica Lange who has played different characters throughout the show and Star Trek and Heroes actor Zachary Quinto has been outstanding. At the end of each episode you can not help but have a morbid curiosity of what will happen in the next one. It has at all, Drama, Story telling and heart stopping freaky moments. If you have only heard of this show and have not begun to watch,, get started. www.hardasstv.com American horror story is a gripping and entertaining show with lots of twists and shocks that leave it's audience asking for more. It has a great cast ensemble with most of the lot delivering stellar performances. Jessica Lange truly deserved the golden globe award which she got for her brilliant performance . The story setting is vintage as ever - haunted house , asylum of deranged criminals. But what sets the show truly disparate is the treatment . The music truly adds zest to the eerie setting . The blending of present with past stories in Season 1 was really good . Usually in horror stories characters take a backseat but here the character development is really awesome especially in season 1. Having seen season 1 and 2 back to back i must admit that season 1 was quite better than season 2. I would have rated the show 10 on 10 if the last few episodes in season 2 hadn't turn quite banal in comparison to the shock value of it preceding episodes. Overall show deserves a watch , it promises to keep you on the edge . 1. Murder House is a cerebral and campy foray into real-life horrors whose muddled plot threads are held together by perfectly casted characters, quippy dialogue, and atmospheric tension. (8/10)<br/><br/>2. Thanks to sacrilegious scares and potent character-driven narratives, Asylum embodies television at its most unhinged, made all the more chilling by heady filmmaking and sinister themes. (10/10)<br/><br/>3. Although unfocused storytelling dilutes some of its magic, Coven is funny and reliably offbeat, underscored by brilliant production, original characters, and creative thrills. (9/10)<br/><br/>4. Bizarre concepts and unique cast members can't salvage Freak Show's few standout characters from being overshadowed by lethargic writing in this aimless sideshow. (5.5/10)<br/><br/>5. Hotel lacks a strong foundation, resulting in a comically inept snoozefest that can only be enjoyed for its addictive glamour and B-movie cheese, if viewers can tolerate its redundant gore and ostentatious sexuality. (3/10)<br/><br/>6. Roanoke has an original style and plenty of grisly diversions, but its misguided format spirals into a repetitive snafu stuffed with contrived scenarios, cluttered execution, and incompetent acting. (3.5/10)<br/><br/>7. Cult's shoehorned politics blunders their way through banal horror tropes, sloppy characterization, and bland camera work to an uninspired conclusion, offset slightly by a concise structure and witty humor. (4/10)<br/><br/>8. An epic cast saves Apocalypse from going down with the franchise, but disjointed writing and an awful beginning undermine its welcome return to the grounded horror and tasteful cinematography of earlier seasons. (6.5/10)<br/><br/>9. 1984 proves the anthology can still find ways to draw fresh blood in this twisty and campy excursion whose streamlined narrative is strengthened by a dynamic cast and philosophical overtones. (8.5/10) I really enjoyed the first 4 seasons. But I feel every new season I watch things just get worse. I haven't seen the newest season 1984 yet though.<br/><br/>Seasons 2&4- 9 stars. Seasons 1,5,6- 7 stars. Season 8- 3 stars. The first years were great, but steadily declined as the creative juices dried up. More of the usual witches against witches (male or female); usual satanic spells; usual candles (and lots of them); usual fire pit; usual symbolisms; usual disembowelments; usual die, but then spring back to life; usual weird hair styles & black clothing (cheap prop hooks); oh!, how can one not mention the usual make your enemies fly/crawl (sort of) up walls; usual there's a young one on the way to give us more in season 9. Cheap CGI effects; pedestrian acting. It has gone down and down and down hill each year. You know it must be getting bad when they lost all their big actors.Now it's just a bunch of whiny teenagers with a horrible story line. I don't know what happened to the creativity. Just needs to stop before they ruin it even more. I very much enjoyed season 1-5 + cult but roanole and apocalypse were too bad and it dident feel like the same show. Otherwise it is a Great series and i recommend people to just skip season 6 and 8. But it would have gotten a 10/10 if Roanoke and apocalypse werent utter garbage I'm not a great reviewer but I'll give my opinion. The show's premise and new seasonal storylines make it unique in never getting old. Also, the influx of new actors keeps it fresh, while the maintaining of original actors (like Evan Peter's who better never leave because he's so awesome) always bring a smile to your face as you see them bring their new characters to life.<br/><br/>The acting is always top notch. The writing is also well done, however, I feel it has changed from where it began. The mental asylum season was actually gripping with its psychological twists. The stories since have actually taken a somewhat comical twists. Its almost as though they present the appearance of horror while injecting lighthearted humor all along the way.<br/><br/>I'd prefer they go back to their roots. Keep the humor out of it. Let our minds enjoy the ride, descending into the psychological fear, as you used to allow us too. I feel if they go back to their roots they will never end. There's a reason I enjoy Netflix's Marvel storylines better than Disney's. Netflix creates dark and gritty storylines. They aren't afraid to take chances. Marvel injects cheesy humor over and over with formulaic writing that we've seen a thousand times in other storylines.<br/><br/>I still rate this show a 10 though, just because I keep coming back and enjoy it so much. I just think it could be better as mentioned above. This show from season 1 till now is a MASTERPIECE... trust the revieiyou wouldn't be disappointed Not only is this amazingly acted, filmed and written it also has the best anthology story's I've ever seen in any other program, even better than black mirror and that's saying something. Jessica Lange, brilliant, brings the first 4 seasons life, Cathy Bates, taissa farmiga, lady gaga, just amazing and Saraha Paulson is one of and if not the main star of the show. Gory, fun, imaginative and gritty, everything I love in a show, the only thing I will pick up on is season 1, my least favourite but yet so good Started out with Freak Show. It is my favorite Season. Initially I couldn't watch this series because I found Freak Show too unsettling, but gave it another shot and it's really captivating. Got through the whole season and I am very impressed by the acting, story, and twists and turns. I don't get hooked on series very easily (with the exception of Shameless) because they always start to get boring as I watch on.<br/><br/>After Freak Show, I gave Roanoke a shot but it got boring already, too much skipping back and forth between the interviews and the reenactment. Then I gave Hotel a shot but I couldn't stand Lady Gaga "trying" to be scary or intimidating. Sorry, I like her but she is just not scary. She's too stagey... I couldn't take her seriously. She just acted like Lady Gaga in one of her videos. Jessica Lange was a phenomenal and more believable lead villain.<br/><br/>Watched Asylum and it was good also with some twists, but Freak Show was still better in my opinion. Coven was not scary at all but watchable. I still liked the story and the acting. Lastly I ended with Murder House. It was a little disappointing, and some stuff I don't get. Like why is Moira the only ghost that aged. And why did some ghosts remain in their deadly looking state when they returned but yet when Vivien died, she was a cleaned-up ghost? Seemed like some get to be the good ghosts and some didn't have that choice or knew they were even dead. And why was Tate so strong at times, but yet when he was chased down by his victims they beat the heck out of him? So many things didn't make sense to me. Seems like it was written to please the viewers and didn't stay true to its element. Other than Murder House, the other 3 seasons were well done and thought out. What can I say that any half decent judge can so obviously see, impressive, imaginative, delicious, creepy, super, the show is just so damn good, prepare to be entertained. Sat down in the beginning not knowing how good it might be, with a title like "American Horror Story" I knew that the description suited me just fine, but how good would it be. The first season was just so weird, eerie, and suspenseful, I knew immediately that I had found a show of the highest order. The acting is just superb, I knew some of the bigger names and was very impressed by some of the lesser known's, all in all they're giving the script its justice. I, along with other fans, look anxiously forward to seeing with each season, what! next. Please keep the seasons coming, some people tire of long running shows but not me, the more the better. If for whatever reason you happen to be new to the series, do yourself a favor, pull up a chair, strap in, and enjoy! Ryan Murphy surprised us all with AHS after TV shows like Nip Tuck or Glee. Who could have imagined him making one of the most creative and interesting horror TV show of all time ? None.<br/><br/>Each season is different from another in mostly every way. The casting is most of the time the same but Murphy found a way to keep it entertaining for years. Many would agree that season 3 and 4 were not as good as the others but every TV shows face its own "down".<br/><br/>At this moment, season 6 shows that Murphy is far from resting and knows how to keep getting creative about his work. And i would lie if i say i wouldn't like this show to last for decades because i keep getting surprised by the universe created here.<br/><br/>The acting is still good and every recurring actors keep showing how different they can be from a role to another. And this is the same with the theme : from the ghosts to the witches, it's clear that the possibilities are endless but what's makes me feel good about this is the fact that there is no other shows like this.<br/><br/>American Horror Story is and will stay the horror TV show every horror-fan need in his life. American Horror story is probably the most amazing yet revolting TV show all at the same time. Each season is very different which is creative, and it makes it more interesting. Generally the whole show is scary and made to keep viewers at the edge of their seat because of all the mystery. AHS premieres on FX, it's overall an amazing show, but some seasons worried me and I'm sure some of the other viewers felt the same way. My favorite season of all 3 is Coven, it was absolutely perfect not too much but not boring either. Asylum was probably the worst season and then Hotel is a close second, they were both very over the top and went too far in some cases. The Asylum was horrible and not suitable for children under 18, but the audience that you attract is the complete opposite of course. Hotel was revolting, it was so bad that i refused to finish the season, it made no sense to me and the producers gave the worst excuse for an actress and pop star the lead role, Lady Gaga. Lady Gaga was horrible, she captured the role very well but I just don't like her so I feel like that's why I think the season was so bad. If I had to give American Horror Story, Series 1-5, it would be a solid 4.5. Though I love the creepy and gory things about the show, sometimes they take things a bit too far. There were times I wondered if I should really be watching the show only because of the over the top things the characters did. Though I completely understand the plot and idea of what's actually happening, I just wasn't to fond of some of the seasons. I'm a very big binge watcher and I hope that the next season is a big hit, I want the cruise to make me feel the way I did when I was watching Coven all the excitement should be there. AHS is an overall good show and I recommend it to people who like mystery, excitement, and adventure. It is a great TV show!In each episode there is action and curiosity about what will happen and you never get bored.It is a frightening but no depressed series and it has also black humor.The directing and music are amazing and of course the characters.So much things happening to every episode that you have to be quite focused when you watch it.The dialogs are interesting with very good acting.Over the series there is a continuous data presentation for the lives of the characters and many experiences and memories they have.There are common elements with famous thriller and police works that make the series even more interesting.There are not many such series and is worth to watching it. Certainly not for everyone because not everyone likes this kind but those who are fans of horror and action they will love it. This is my favourite show on television. Within five minutes of starting the first episode of season one, I was hooked and couldn't get enough. The actors are brilliant, and I love how they bring back some of the same ones for each new season, and I love how each new season is a different story than the last. My favourite season would have to be Freak Show, mainly because of Dandy Mott's very dark character. I personally like how dark the show is. I recommend it to all of my friends. If you're reading this review and haven't seen it yet, please do. You don't exactly have to start with Murder House, but I recommend it, because there are a few mentions of past seasons in later seasons. American Horror Story is an anthology series consisting of the series Murder House, Asylum, Coven, and the upcoming Freak Show. Although the cast varies each season, frequents are the always superb Jessica Lange, Sarah Paulson, Evan Peters and Lily Rabe. These few always shine, but particularly Lange. Her performances are phenomenal, and are worth all of the praise. The other few have particular seasons in which they are noteworthy- Evan Peters is horrifying in season 1, as for for Lily Rabe in season 2, and Sarah Paulson in Season 3. But many of the supporting and guest actors can also steal the show. <br/><br/>The writing in the show is so superb that it will have you hooked like almost no other shows. The style is like no other show I've seen. It is an essential for horror fans. Also, while directing is something not usually noted in these kinds of shows, but Alfonso Gomez-Rejon's directing elevates the material so much that it is hard not to notice. The show simply wouldn't be what it is without him. <br/><br/>The best season, by far, is Asylum. Coven is a good show as well, but it fell short in what I was hoping for. Murder House is very impressive as well.<br/><br/>All in all, the entire show us worth watching and does not receive as much credit as it should. But do not watch this show if you have a light stomach or do not like getting scared. I loved this season as far as I have seen the last episode. Till the end I believed that Fiona would make it and will come back as winner but I was disappointed.<br/><br/>All these kids playing witches, Cordelia with her none existent powers and all over crying about anything ... all these losers are meant to be the winners now?!?<br/><br/>My rating was meant to be a 9 or 10 but with this ending, with kicking the only tough character the witches had, its just a 4 for the good times there were - damned to be meaningless with this ending. <br/><br/>Surprises are quiet a fine thing but boring characters will not get better just because of a change in the management. Cordelia was either boring and irritating about the whole season and in a good ending she would have messed up with a severed throat, taking a last stupid look at her triumphing mother. Expect the Unexpected! American Horror story is humorous,classic,no clichÃ©s and unexpectedly beautiful. The cast is Perfect. The plots are tremendous! AHHH cant stop saying good things about my review! hahaha New Orleans! please! so genius! Witches, jessica lagne, taissa farmiga, Sarah Pulson, and WTF! EMMA ROBERTS! what could go wrong?! I mean, there are witches with different unique powers, telekinesis, divination, pyrokinesis, vitalum vitalis,blah blah blah! GENIUS!!!!! the gore, the violence, the blood was realistic. This is a must watch series, especially the third season, I mean, you can go nuts for this. You must not miss any episode! So, I was finally able to play catch up by watching the first season of American Horror Story (keep in mind, that I just started the season), and here is one of the biggest things I will point out about this show; Don't let the title scare you away (pun intended), the show itself is more of a mini-drama series than it is of an actual drawn out horror show. Without giving too much away, you don't really have to watch the first season, to understand the second one or the third season, let's make that part clear. The show in a way is twisted, suspenseful, fun, and an entertaining thriller series. Where do I begin? It makes "Criminal Minds" look like water (granted that blood is thicker), as far as the storyline and creep factor goes. The whole cast is great in this show from Lily Rabe to Evan Peters, to the legendary Jessica Lange. If you want something original, twisted, catchy and entertaining, I would suggest American Horror Story. I want to compare this show to the 2005 film "The Exorcism of Emily Rose", the trailers portrayed the film as a horror, similar to the 1973 film "The Exorcist", but many were shocked to find out that "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" was more of a courtroom drama as opposed to a horror film. "American Horror Story" airs Wednesdays at 10 pm on FX. Watched it a second time, and I will say one thing; Don't let the title scare you. If you have seen films like "Joy Ride", "Misery", "The Glass House", "The Others", "The Changeling", or "The Turn of the Screw", then you may or may not enjoy this show. This show relies more on old-fashioned suspense, rather than the blood and guts (it has it, but not to the extent of "Saw" or "Hostal"). I have watched both seasons, and they are both very different (each season is its own story). I barely praise about the cast in any TV show that I have seen, but for this show, I must say the cast is amazing, especially the central characters of each season, that is including Jessica Lange, Frances Conroy, Evan Peters, Lily Rabe, Sarah Paulson, Zachary Quinto, Dylan McDermott, Taissa Farmiga, Alexandra Breckenridge, and Connie Britton.<br/><br/>I will try my best to give a review of Season One without spoilers. When a family moves to Los Angeles, to start a new life, things seem to go quite well for them. However, not long after they move in, they discover that the house hides a terrifying secret that will sooner or later, put their lives in danger. Desperate to make things work, the broken family of three decide to settle in, but later realize that 'misery loves company', and that 'history repeats itself'. FX has a keeper with this show. I hate all the other shows that FX has to offer (except 'The Americans' and 'Anger Management'), but 'American Horror Story' keeps me tuned on this channel. The first season was okay, but 'Asylum' scared the living hell out of me. 'Coven' is great! Another reason is that the acting is phenomenal! Kathy Bates is so great for the role she plays, Jessica Lange is awesome, Zachary Quinto was the perfect actor to play a psycho in last season! Ryan Murphy has really impressed me with this show, and I always look forward for every new episode and season. This show is underrated, because of 'The Walking Dead' (which is overrated) and every year, 'AHS' gets more popular. This show is so great! It is the most Emmy-nominated show every year! Don't stop watching after the first episode, the show gets better after the second episode. Believe me, I have seen every single episode! American Horror Story-one would think,are the creators out of their mind? The genre which doesn't have very much good reputation on the big screen,they're bringing it on the small one? That's when you're wrong.I was very disappointing and angry because it wasn't scary at all (Specially season 2),but when the things started moving ahead,boy,i was really blown over.The way they matched the characters,the location,everything was perfect.I have never seen a show like this before.Season 2 even bested season 1.And let me tell you,both the seasons have very happy endings.Or at least for me.When i was watching the finale,i thought,this is the scene where some directors lose their mind and write up a really messes-up end,let's see what happens with this one.But i was very impressed and thanked God and the writers that they didn't screw it up.The actors play very different roles in both the seasons.You would find it hard to believe that they were the same ones.Last i would say that this show is not everyone's cup of tea.You need to have a soothing environment for this.And if you like slow-but- brilliant-thrillers,than this might prove a jackpot. American Horror story is not your normal haunted house story. It's full of other things that can haunt a person. Adultery infidelity loneliness rage guilt and hate. The Harmons are a family reeling from two tragic events. Mrs Harmon suffered a miscarriage and never recovered from it. She Froze out her husband to the point he had a affair in which she caught him in the act. A year later they move cross country to a L.A Victorian mansion with a shady past. Everyone who has lived there has died horrifying deaths. The Ghosts who haunt the house are trapped there begging for release. Some are vindictive. The Next door neighbour knows more about the house then she lets on. It's revealed she used to own the house and had her share of tragic events in it. The Evil that dwells in the house targets the Harmons to be the next permanent residents of Murder House. A Strong moody atmospheric show that is classy and has a film noir style. I like it because it doesn't dumb down itself to the people watching it. instead it respects the person's intellect and delivers a horror story full of frights Fears and Ghosts that are unlike any seen before on the screen. Classy show. Classic frights. I have watch AHS from the beginning and some seasons I loved more than others such as Murder House, Coven, Hotel and Roanoke. Apocalypse and 1984 were really bad. Please please bring back the original quality of AHS. Quite interesting and very good TV show.All season is good other then season-7. I recommend that you all. "Cult", "Apocalypse" and "1984" really suck. The first 3 seasons were absolutely amazing; great stories (especially "Asylum"), amazing actors and very good writing. "Freak Show" was good too, just not as good as the first three.
Everything went downhill when "Hotel" & "Roanoke" came out; okay stories, mediocre actors and bad writing.
I have absolutely no idea what Ryan Murphy was thinking. How could he ruin such a good show?<br/><br/>"Cult" is basically "feminists hating men for 11 episodes".
"Apocalypse" is basically a "Murder House", "Coven" and "Hotel" crossover but they took out the good parts.
"1984" is basically a stereotypical "camp with some murders in it for 9 episodes".<br/><br/>Conclusion: "American Horror Story" used to good, now it doesn't.<br/><br/>5/10 Can they please choose Another villain then Evan Peeters next time. He's just reprising his roles all the times it gets tiresome. After episode 3 of Roanoke and this new season I lost interest quite fast. Hotel had a sort of class, great soundtrack even if itwas almost totally ripped from the hunger, great FX. and a great mix of actressess/actors giving it that push. damn it had daddario and gaga. thats badass! The new seasons just feel sloppy and I get irritated on every characters whimsical decisions. Breathing loud when there's psycho killers in Close proximity, being naive all the time not figuring out anything. its a lot of these stuff that makes season 7 so damn boring. And yes.. Evan Peeters is a bad villain.. nobody would fall for a blue smurf talking politics and cult drivel. Nope, Hotel Is still American horror story's Magnus opus. I only got around to start watching "American Horror Story" in 2016, as I never got around to getting into the series when it aired, and I didn't really find the synopsis all that appealing back then.<br/><br/>And I must say that after having sat through season 1, then I was dangerously close to giving up on the series, because season 1 wasn't really all that impressive. Sure, it had good effects and good acting, but it seemed like a chaotic scrambled mess of a story and it didn't really install any fear or dread, and it just didn't really reach out to me.<br/><br/>But I stuck with it and decided to give season two a chance. And wow, just wow! The show really kicks up in gear and becomes great. The series shed its slow-paced and semi-dull skin, turning into a full-blown creepy series.<br/><br/>I have watched seasons one, two and three over a short period, and must admit that seasons two and three were like a drug. I just had to watch more and more.<br/><br/>What makes "American Horror Story" so great is actually the story lines, although personally I didn't care much for season 1. But also the narrative approach there is to each season. But the most important is the acting. Here I must say that I am more than impressed with the cast. I especially applaud Jessica Lange, because she is phenomenal. But all the acting talents on the cast list are doing good jobs with their various, literally various, roles throughout the series.<br/><br/>I enjoy the thing with the same actors playing different characters in each season. It adds some odd sense of bizarre continuity to the entire series, despite it being different stories and different characters completely.<br/><br/>The effects in "American Horror Story" are quite good, and actually impressive at times. And the special effects team is really doing a good job at bring the oddities of the series to life on the screen.<br/><br/>The sounds are a big part of the series as well, and the sound production team should get a big credit for bringing a sense of creepiness to the series. And the title theme is a definite memorable track.<br/><br/>"American Horror Story" is a series that sinks in under your skin and sticks with you. It is a show that takes root deep in your psyche and will leave you craving for more. "American Horror Story" is a dear addition to my DVD movie collection. And I am looking forward to getting to watch the fourth, fifth and forthcoming seasons. American Horror Story is an absolute delight to watch. As a horror movie expert I have seen a lot of horror and gore. This television series is a contest continuing horror fanatic to watch on a daily. The show consists of a new horror story every season with amazing detail and proficiency. American Horror Story is a great thriller that includes jump scares, pop outs, and all around that feeling you love when you're alone and afraid with nowhere to go.<br/><br/>This show is a great choice to watch if you like horror movies that you wish you would never end. It's a great show to get hooked on and relate your own version of horror to the show as each episode is a brand new chill down your spine. <br/><br/>Overall, I would highly recommend watching this show and would give it a 10/10 for cleverness, effort, and a brand new scary material brought to the screen. Absolute delight. This show is amazing, the actors, the storyline, the twists and the props are incredible. Hands down one of my favourite shows ever. The concept that they keep some of the same actors each season but change the characters they play and the storyline was fascinating to me. Each season is totally different to the last from a murder house, to asylum to a witch coven with the newest season being a freak-show starting on a Halloween special, beyond excited! If you've never seen it and love twisted, blood and a messed up storyline then I definitely recommend you watch it! Enjoy indulging this masterpiece and make sure to watch it alone! Season 3 appears to be No exception. This is an excellent series. And this season 3 has started off phenomenally fitting pieces together from previous seasons and implementing the new theme of bitch craft perfectly with Jessica as the Head Witch & playing the role so very well that (please excuse me Jessica) she appears very natural. I enjoyed it to the extent that it seemed very short to me and I was left wanting more I can hardly wait till next week. I was happy to see the several familiar faces from the previous seasons too. The writing in this series is superb . Always something to intrigue, or shock. It's a well done creepy show with an appropriate cast for it. I don't believe it has the capability to truly frighten me because it takes quite a bit to accomplish that but regardless this is one Awesome show! How can you keep up the the tension in a classic horror movie for 12 episodes? You can't.<br/><br/>The first season of American Horror Story starts like wow, really one of the best pilots ever. The film has style, tension, great writing and acting, but the story itself starts being uninteresting halfway. We get to know the characters, the mystery is not scary anymore, because there's no mystery remaining. The story starts repeating itself instead of leaving the audience in doubts and the bizarre becomes boring. The horror becomes almost a comedy in the season final!<br/><br/>The creators should have been happy with a 6-episode mini-series, this ghost-story could have been one of the best TV shows of all time.<br/><br/>Great idea though that the second season will be something completely different! I can't wait to watch! First of all, let me start by saying the 7/10 is completely earned by the first season. When I first started watching I hoped for an eerie, creepy and maybe even scary show. Thats what I got, except maybe the scary part. But for an entire show to be scary, that would be a bit much to ask. I really enjoyed the first few episodes which where a bit scary now and then. And as the show continued it became more eerie and nasty than it was scary, but I accepted that and enjoyed every minute of it. There where even moments I caught myself wishing for some characters to die. The twist with the piggy-pig man was unexpected as was the storyline of Violet. I devoured the first season and was left with so many questions, like how is Michael going to turn out when he grows up, will they do a '10 years later' on the next season etc etc. And in my obliviance, I started watching the second season filled with anticipation of how the makers would proceed... But they didn't... It's a new storyline, with the same actors who are suddenly completely different characters, there is no link to the previous season and all and all its kind of disappointing. It's not the least bit scary and to be honest, it's mostly annoying. With God and Satan and the creepy doctor and the aliens and all... I don't know, I think I expected way more from the makers and I would have loved some answers to all the questions raised at the end of season 1. I liked the show but hate the way they use the Lord's name in vain. I loved the first season but didn't like the ending that much. but still a great show Come on ??? It's a different look of a horror movie. I'm old and could relate. I love the risk RM After 7 seasons i am still love this show so so much . Hopefully Jessica Langge will return American Horror Story is an interesting show in that each season is anthological and main characters can meet grisly fates. Not every character has a happy ending and there are many life lessons that are shown through the seasons.<br/><br/>Each season opens with certain mysteries that are explored throughout the season, but thankfully it is not in a slow manner like so many other shows, it is quick to the point and keeps you engaged.<br/><br/>The acting is absolutely amazing and the writing is great too. However, with good things, there must always be bad. There are quite a few things that are bad in later seasons.<br/><br/>When Jessica Lange left the show, the next season Hotel was absolutely horrible. I suggest you definitely skip that season. There are ties to other seasons, but it is horrible to watch. Otherwise, it is up to the audience. There are a lot of fans divided on Freak Show and Roanoke. Each season is very different, but it is a great show. I definitely recommend it! At first I had to force myself to like this season of AHS. I liked the whole concept but there came a point where they did go too far. This season is supposed to a based on real life events. One episode showcased issues in society that deals with the controversy of "extreme feminism" and abortion. After that I said to myself: this is my least favorite season by far. But as the next episode aired, I was hooked. "Drink The Kool-Aid" was such a great episode, it made me want to watch it over and over again. This episode was full of character development we all desired, tons of unpredictable plot twists and iconic moments that will not be forgotten. I was going to wait til the season is over to post a review, but the episode was so good, it has changed my mind about the entire season. Can wait to be blown away again, I hope they keep this streak up before I lose hope again! AHS is back! Its for women and teen girls. If your them here you go smdh I can get how this isn't for every one, but it a genius show.
Hotel is not my fav. But the others are great and ya don't have to watch them in order or the other ones.
They have clever interlinks but ya don't have to get them to enjoy it The last two seasons I bought on Prime I think I can wait until it comes out This show has a specific pattern.. its good in the beginning and becomes trash. I mean total garbage I love the show, very scary, but it is sometimes difficult to tell who is dead and who is alive. And What is up with the rubber S&M suit? The maid appears old to some and sexy young thing to others. The ghosts can drag people around and do all kinds of things that make it impossible to separate them from live characters. Too many people dying in one place over an extended period of time should be a good reason to not purchase a house. When the RE professional discloses the demise of the previous owners, she conveniently forgets to disclose the fates of the rest of the previous residents.<br/><br/>I loved the sexy aspects of the story, but they become really creepy when the ghosts start taking part in the action. Why did they have to make it so weird and artsy?? It starts off relatively straight forward nuclear apocalypse drama... But then they decided to add the candles, the Victorian dresses, the gloomy Kristen Wiig, and then...the horses and "twilight" wannabe guy at the end?? Couldn't they make a normal post-apocalyptic drama??*sigh* lets hope it doesn't get worst Wacth this video its pretty awesome! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAEWezuf-1g this video is my review of the show. this comment contains no spoilers but the video does, its for people who have already seen the season just to get a quick recap in the form of a fast rap.<br/><br/>American Horror Story Season 1 Recap (rap) a fan raps this and covers everything that happens in the first season! its really creative<br/><br/>www.blissandsitter.com<br/><br/>I think AHS is great and this is just a quick video describing it. thanks very much Was a great show until they turned it an ad for Apple. Obviously marketing to 12 year old girls. Well I read the reviews and then started watching the pilot, with low expectations. Rather I found it very good. I really don't get the fact why people start comparing stuffs like this with previous similar ones. I mean the action is good, storyline is great and I couldn't see anyone over-acting. Right from the beginning, the building of characters was next to perfect. Its exactly what a pilot promises to deliver. A great start to a great storyline. I just hope they don't stretch it unnecessarily like few other TV series. Actors chosen are good, suiting the story. I would suggest to give this a try. Will definitely hook you up. Highly recommended for horror anthology fans, great acting, amazing plot lines, great effects, and it's just all out amazing Having read the reviews I had high hopes of this anthology. As the consensus seems to be that season 2 is the best and seasons are not interconnected, atleast not in a larger sense, so I started off with season 2. The beginning was good, I'd say upto the sixth episode but then it lost the plot. It became funny for a seasoned horror enthusiast like me. There's no law;everyone is being admitted to the same asylum;no patient seems to have any family;Sister Jude is admitted to the asylum;Kit returns to the asylum as it was his grandmother's house;One moment Kit is afraid of the electric chair/death,the next he is ready to let the doctor stop his heart so that contact with aliens can be made.....
There are many other loopholes.
This is the only season I'll complete, because if this is the best, I don't want to risk wasting my time on the others. This is one of my favorite shows. But the Season 9 is a disapointment. Every season has something unexpectable but the last season is just an ordinary story. I hope season 10 would be better. For previous seasons - I LOVE EACH OF THEM! And I cant wait to see what is going to happen. S1 - ( 8.4/10 ) Very creepy, and it's the original American Horror Story. Nothing will ever be like this season. Funny characters, compelling episodes and great story overall. Disappointing ending, but it's still watchable.
S2 - ( 9/10 ) AMAZING. BEST acting, BEST writing, cinematography is on point. It's action packed and scary at the same time, leaving you on the edge of your seat. Considered the best
S3 - ( 8.5/10 ) Lmao this season is funny. Writing is funny, story is compelling. Second half of the season grows slower and weird, not the best finale, but still you will fall in love with this season and it's iconic, one of a kind characters.
S4 - ( 7.8/10 ) Slow story, relies too much on the characters. Interesting idea yet disappointing execution.
S5 - ( 7.8/10 ) Love it! It's dark and has a deep meaning that many won't understand or feel. It's either a you love it or hate it season.
S6 - ( 7.4/10 ) Weird. Different. Okay. It's a skipable season. It's scary, though. dramatic and alright.
S7 - ( 7.7/10 ) Slow story, get past the first few episodes and you'll love the progression. Unlikeable characters, but great plot points.
S8 - ( 8/10 ) Expected more since the hype was so overused. A combination of season 1 + 2, its over does the use of depending on the characters to keep the story going. Action could've gone way much farther, yet it didn't.
S9 - ( 8.4 / 10 ) Nooice
Overall, you'll fall deep for this show. Iconic characters with unique styles and creative writing, it's a beautiful show in itself. ( 8.6/10 ) Sascha Malkovich stars in the American Horror Story series in six seasons of the series, dozens of excellent cameo episodes. He single it out Mr. Vogel, a gay patient, clown Ronie, Ghost and Freddy. It gives the series a rating of 10, but not because it is part of it. Fun and unique series, but each season should be 8 episodes - TOPS! The same thing happens for most of the themes: Start off great, then flame out 2/3 of the way in. I actually enjoyed "1984" because it was on the shorter side at 10 episodes. If FX can focus more on quality over quantity, each of these seasons could be so much better. I only started watching AHS from the Roanoke Season. A season that actually scared me enough to turn an episode off to watch later. When the son came up of course. lol. Needless to say. If u highly sensitive. Or can be shocked quite easily. This is not for u. For me - in the last 2 years. I have gone back into the slasher horror genre. Meaning I have started enjoy horror movies again. So there is loads to catch up on. Ive been jumping around the AHS seasons and love been loving them. I have really enjoyed finding some of the Easter eggs. Which tie into other seasons.
So without giving away anything. This is a must watch. It will shock the pants off u. American horror story is extremely enjoyable series. I have watched every single season of it and loved it. Some seasons are little less interesting but still very enjoyable. I love ahs and i love the actors. Evan peters is awesome like usual. The only complaint i have it sarah Paulson screaming and crying all the time. Way overdone. It calms down halfway through the season...THANK GOD AHS is entertaining most of the time but not always the best quality. Everyone has seasons they like and seasons they didn't like. Overall, this is a strong series that is often truly terrifying, with an undercurrent of very black humor. My only complaint-and it's significant-is that later seasons too often glorify real-life murders for the sake of entertainment. Those episodes seem incredibly disrespectful to the survivors of those murders and ethically questionable. I've watched AHS since the beginning and like all long running shows there are good Seasons, meh Seasons and downright flabby seasons! I loved Murder House, Asylum and Coven, was a bit underwhelmed by Hotel and Freak Show, loved Roanoke, was hugely disappointed by Cult and am now halfway through Apocalypse and am very pleased to say Season 8 is a big improvement with writers and cast back on form! I'm not giving away any spoilers as viewers in the UK may not have seen the season yet but it's a wonderful homage to classic past seasons, has stand out performances by Kathy Bates, Sarah Paulson and most of the ensemble cast with special mention going to the magnificent Cody Fern (American Crime Story) for his mesmerising performance that is both very creepy and very charismatic at the same time. The only slight gripe for me is that having the ensemble cast play multiple characters is a little confusing, especially if you've never watched AHS before. This season is definitely for the hardened fans like myself, who will get great pleasure in revisiting Coven and Murder House - especially the latter. All in all, a camp, creepy hell fest which took me back to the days of good old Hammer Horror and such classics as The Devil Rides Out. It was fantastic to see Hollywood legend, Joan Collins, in a hilarious role as a ghastly film star diva. It was bit Harry Potter in places (Warlock School!!), but for someone who after Season 7, said they wouldn't watch a other season of AHS, I'm now anticipating AHS 1984! I've been watching AHS since season 1, and apart from season 6 which I found total rubbish, the other seasons have been really good.<br/><br/>I would advise anyone new to AHS to binge watch it from the start, as it does intertwine as each season goes along.<br/><br/>At end of season 8 it felt like the chapters were complete, and would of been a great ending to an almost perfect compilation of stories.<br/><br/>Now on season 9 and all though it's only had 1 episode so far, it feels like it's just been made for the sake of making it, if you've watched any of the Friday the 13th films or series it will feel like a very poor copy of them.<br/><br/>I'm really hoping it picks up drastically and the next few seasons tie in with this new one somehow, or it's going to tarnish what has been a very good series so far.<br/><br/>Overall score 7/10
Seasons: 1-2-3-4-5-7-8 (10/10)
Season 6 (-2)
Season 9 (-1 so far on episode 1) First of all, it's hard to give "American Horror Story" a rating as a whole. Eight seasons in, this horror anthology series has had its ups and downs. As described by its creator Ryan Murphy, each series is a "self-contained miniseries with its own beginning and end". Many seasons are absolutely terrific ("Murder House", "Asylum", "Freak Show"), others pssable ("Coven", "Roanoke"), others pure disappointments (the rest). But one thing is certain the production value of "AHS" holds a high standard, and so does the acting for most parts. Evan Peters, Kathy Bates, Denis O'Hare, and John Carol Lynch makes memorable performances almost every time they're on screen, but the true star of the series is Jessica Lange (starring in seasons 1 through 4), who executes every role almost to perfection. Overall, "AHS" is a very well-produced, entertaining, unique show, filled with gore, horror, sex, and drama, and I most definitely recommend people to watch it. I started watching the 1st season & was hooked. 2nd season didn't care for at all. 3rd season was awesome. 4th won't watch I hate clowns. 5th season entertaining. 6th season was a bit of a stretch. 7th season compelling, captivating as Evan Peters did multiple bad boy roles. Sarah Paulson killed it. 8th season was generally good. 9th season can't wait to see it. Absolutely brilliant!!!! Just finished the first anthology murder house n onto second one.
The acting is superb n totally believable. I'm literally on the edge of my seat n took a breather to write this.
My heart's been racing n I forgot to breathe! Really really excellent writing n like nothing I've seen before n I've seen thousands of horror movies but this is unique n Jessica Lange is outstanding! A must see series!!!! I've finished the coven n now on S4 E3 n it's harrowing!!!!! Horror to the extreme!!!!! Can't say enough to outline the absolute brilliance of this you must watch it! It's beyond any other program !!!!!!!
Oh dear lord!!!! Am on S4E4 n I'm a diehard fan of true horror genre n this is turning my stomach ðŸ™ˆ it's barbaric but strangely brilliant! Acting superb n once again totally believable! It's taking me awhile to watch it cos it's quite disturbing! A must see.
Mmmmm onto S5E3 n it's lost the plot a little bit. Too much blood n gore n not much of a plot. I personally think lady Gaga was miscast in this n this series is swings n roundabouts. No absolute begining n can't fathom an ending n nowhere near as nail biting as the previous series. Such a shame but I'll stick it out till the end.
OMG!!!!!! Just finished season 8 n it was outstanding! It gave credence to the whole AHS saga n is a must see season that gives answers to unanswered questions throughout the saga. Every story/season has a purpose..... however I still struggled to comprehend the freak show n it still isn't my favourite.
Cody Evan is excellent in his role as Michael Langdon n good eye candy too ðŸ˜‰ Murphy and Falchuk have created one of the preeminent anthology horror series on television. The creators inspired anthology series to follow in two distinct ways. Each season has an individual storyline and the series uses some of the same actors in different roles throughout the series. This is clearly evident in Martin's series, "Slasher". This series has excellent direction, writing, cinematography, score, special effects and acting. All of the artists in each season deliver superlative performances. In particular Bates, Lange, Paulson, Peters, McDermott, Rabe and Gaga are commanding. It's too lengthy to describe the plot for each season in a review. Let's just say each season stands on it's own. The plots are clever, terrifying, bone chilling, gory, unique, psychological, sublime, duplicitous and always have cathartic endings. Each season is individual, so you don't need to start with season one but this viewer would suggest granting each season a chance as all of the seasons so far have been brilliant. This viewer's favorites are 'Murder House', 'Freak Show', 'Hotel' and 'Cult". This series is addictive, captivating and mesmerizing. It is almost impossible to find a better series than this on television, nevermind on film that weighs up to it's accomplishment . This series is memorable, virtuous, blazing, cathartic and unparalleled. As I stream 99% of the content I watch, I'm waiting with immense anticipation and confidence that the eighth season, 'Apocalypse' won't disappoint. If the horror genre is your thing "AHS" unreservedly delivers the goods. This show amazes me how in the first couple episodes of the season you'll be so confused and barely understanding what's going on and then all of a sudden all these lil pieces and details come together to make sense and make a great story! I've heard good things about this series for a long time, but for whatever reason I never turned it on. One night on Netflix I started streaming it and it lived up to its hype. It's interesting and well written. The cast is excellent and the characters are complex. I like that each season starts a new horror story and the actors play different roles.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this show. Chester Creb turns around for the other freaks to get into there places to start a rehearsal. The lights fade out as the drum role starts for the magic trick to begin. Lights brighten' up as Chester Creb turns around with a magicians outfit and Maggie Esmeralda is stuck in a elongated box in an assistant uniform. "Ladies and gentlemen," Chester Creb says as he gets into place to perform the trick, "prepare yourselves to witness" The camera goes toward Chester. "The death-defying feat, first performed by the great Torrini." the camera gets to his face showing theatrical makeup. "For Pope Pius VII." Chester jumps down, "Originally called The Magic Saw." He begins to show the audience the assistant in the box by spinning it around. "Tonight, I will be presenting it to you, with my own dangerous variation." Chester starts to lock Maggie in the box using a wooden slab and handcuffs. Chester then explains where and what the items are used for.
"Uh... Ow... Hey, I... I don't... I don't know this part." Maggie cried. Chester looked angry at Maggie. "I went to a war for you." He said. Maggie appeared as a different woman. "You should have died over there." she said,"We loved each other. Then you had to come back with your metal plate and your head full of bees." Chester back away groaning at the thought of seeing his dead lover. Then, he began to laugh as, he grabbed the saw. Maggie looked scared and concerned. "Chester, stop!" she cried, "I... I can't pull my feet through!"
"Stop talking." he said as he begins to say Maggie in half. "You're distracting me."
"When are you gonna do some real magic?" Marjorie the dummy said as she took place of Maggie. "Stop it, Marjorie. Haven't you done enough to ruin my life?"
"You're Nothing without me."
"I'll show you. Every one of you." Maggie gasps
"Chester! Chester!" She screamed as Chester sawed her in half. Blood dripping from the inside of the box. "Chester, stop!" and then silence. The lights fade out as Marjorie laughs.
The lights fade in with the carnival cast walking on stage. He's out of his costume and in his normal clothes. He waits for a moment or two and then, he pulls the boxes apart. Blood and guts spill onto the ground. Chester shows the audience that he she is split in half. "Ta-da" Chester said breathlessly. Everyone looked shocked as the scene ends.
Now you know a little snippet of American Horror Story. American Horror Story is a show that plays on your fears with each season having a new story and a new plot. I will be talking about what makes a good TV Show Season. It has to be consistent to the plot of the entire show, actors, and the characters. When I say great characters I mean each character cannot be dull and have an interesting backstory that makes the character the character, and you need good actors to play as each character. I will be analyzing each season to determine which season is the best and which is the worst. My name is Brock and this is the Top 3 Seasons of American Horror Story. Spoilers alert.
Number 3: American Horror Story Coven (season 3). Huh another coincidence. Coven is a great season with great effects and perfect characters. It talks about a coven type of academy of witches with strict rules. The coven needs a new ruler after the ruler dies of cancer. But this is one problem as another is a racist who tortured her black slaves and killed some of them. Gets buried out of the ground after being cursed for immortality by the voodoo queen. And this begins the war of witches and voodoo witches.
Coven may have a lot of problems but the plot is consistent and easy to follow. Coven talks about racism. Some of the characters has a backstory. It even introduces an actress -Emma Roberts- who plays as a powerful rich witch. That's fun to say. Rich witch, rich witch, rich witch. He he.
Number 2: American Horror Story Asylum (season 2). What! Another coincidence. Asylum is a great season with perfect backstories very interesting plot and mysteries made this season a phenomenal season. It's about a reporter named Lana Winters who is writing a story on the asylum. A lot of things happened in this season. A guy gets probed by aliens, people get murdered, a Nazi doctor does experiments on the crazy people, and a nun gets possessed by a demon. For the longest time I thought she got possessed by the devil but nope. A couple of the people in the asylum tried to escape and that when we learn that the doctor has put his experiments in the front yard to attack the crazy people when they try to escape.
The plot is consistent and very very easy to follow. The plot is very consistent. Each character has a backstory but the best one is the Nazi doctor. His life is a mystery and we don't know much about his life. The characters have great actors portraying them and you can feel the innocents on some of the "crazy people".
Number 1: American Horror Story Apocalypse (season 8). This is a great season but, before you watch you must watch Murder House and Coven because this season combines these two seasons. It talks about the end of the world -in the first three episodes- the rest of the season it talks about Michael Langdon -the Antichrist- and the coven fighting to save the world from the apocalypse.
The plot is easy to follow and it's very entertaining to watch. I was very engaged and this also helped with the characters. You can relate to some of the characters and Michele's backstory is the longest but saddest backstory in the entire show.
Even though you may not agree with me. This is my list. For a recap the show is a very long but interesting. For a better watch -if you watch it- think about the fact that every episode is connected in some way. Everyone you watches the show has been trying to figure it out. If you should watch it you should watch it in order. Even though Roanoke is very boring, you should still watch it. The show is still running and has been for some time. Thank you for reading this. And I hope you watch American Horror Story. Have a good day, bye. Lady Gaga gives a 'tour de force' performance as "The Countess". Who knew she could act? Wow! Dennis O'Hare's performance was also particularly stellar throughout. There are some venerated and accomplished professionals in the ensemble, but those two stole the spotlight from all the others. I have rewatched this particular season several times, it gets better each time. The deeply researched premise, (based on actual places, historical figures, and events), with a brilliant bit of allagorization by the gifted writing team, each episode, deftly directed, has not been surpassed by any season's before or since. This is my all time favorite show, everything about it is amazing, the acting, the scenery, the plot, etc. I definitely recommend for anyone who can watch darker stuff. My only warning would be that it is a very dark show and it does have a lot of gore and disturbing scenes. Amazing show. I really love this, There can be romance, drama and mystery. Lady gaga is also in here Couldn't agree more that I really like this kind of movie , maybe a bit complicated but you'll know it's a masterpiece when u enjoy watching it Complicated but enjoyable should watch it till the end I absolutely love this show. There are some seasons that are better than others of course. But in general there has yet to be one I disliked, just a few I liked better than others. I love how it explores the darkness inside people, how far people will go to get something they want. And how so many people are really just looking out for themselves not giving a damn about anyone else. The show is genuinely disturbing in the best ways possible. At first, after watching Murder House, I was upset that it was going to be an anthology, recycling the same actors to play new characters in a completely different plot. But after watching the next season I was won over. And now they are beginning to link aspects of the seasons together as well. I hope that they continue the series, best horror show to come out in a long time. This show is awesome. It's so much better with Jessica Lange in it. The woman is beautiful and talented. I am glad it looks like she is returning.
She is the star of the show. There are many talented people on the show but she is my favorite. I hope she continues to be on the show for as long as it's on the air, which is hopefully a long time. This is one of my favourite series of all times, and I've watched a fair few. One of my favourite things about AHS is the use of the same characters throughout all 8 seasons, yet the seasons all link together in a weird way. The last season really shows this. The actors are incredible, Evan Peters & Sarah Paulson being the stars in my eyes. After 8 seasons you're usually thinking to yourself when will it end, this is the opposite. Please be a season 9 Jaw dropping.
I was thinking there would be litigation, because it was sooooo true to life.
Why was it only half a season? Season 5 will forever be my ultimate favorite season. Mainly because it did such a fantastic job acknowledging The Hunger. Every season has its own vibes and I definitely like some more than others but so far the worst season has been season 8. It went in circles and as much as i appreciate the return to murder house... it left much to be desired. Ill keep watching next season but lets hope they do better next time! Whant her back in the show ! Lady Joan Collins should have join the show years ago! In episode 6 we find out for 100 percent sure that Tate not only shot up a school but he is also dead. The daughter has been hanging our with him and the father sees him as a patient. Why doesn't the girl show the internet story to her father for Christ's sake? Wouldn't it be the first thing you do? Also why wouldn't they call the cops? Actually why don't they get in the car, drive away and never ever look back They have undeniable proof a violent ghost lives in their house. So stupid. Any AHS fan knows that the series has some seasons that are exceptional and other seasons that are abhorrent. Every viewer has a different opinion but lets be real. This is exactly how good the writing is per season<br/><br/>Exceptional Writing
MURDER HOUSE
ASYLUM
ROANOKE
CULT<br/><br/>Decent (but not great) Writing
HOTEL<br/><br/>Abhorrent Writing
COVEN
FREAK-SHOW
APOCALYPSE<br/><br/>Go ahead and disagree. Deep down you KNOW I'm right. Was Coven, Freak-Show, or Apocalypse scary? No? But isn't this American HORROR Story? I'm rating it 6 stars because the show has more good seasons than bad but this last season really pushed its luck. Love this show but it tends to feel a little flat without Jessica Lange. The starting seasons melted my heart.
The concept of reporting the plot to the viewer is impressive. So glad to see Jessica Lange back, this season has gone back to it's roots and delivered a fanastic season!! Well done AHS!! Amazing anthology of stories, that now start to entwine and unravel a unified story. Love the acting of most stars, Jessica Lange (missed her talent so much in the latest seasons), Sarah Paulson, Evan Peters, Kathy Bates etc... The story is well written, the setting amazing and the characters multidimensional with a wide range of feelings.<br/><br/>Loved almost all the seasons for their dark twist and its messages, murder house, asylum, coven, freak show, hotel, Roanoke (didn't like it, hate it), cult and apocalypse (I love the s08 how they have created the story, the settings, the characters) Been a long time since I've seen a show that I just couldn't wait until the next episode. This show keeps me on the edge of my seat. It appears, and I thought it would as I agree to some extent, that the obvious references to Trump's divisiveness would be upsetting to some especially since this series is suppose to be entertaining fantasy and not politicized social commentary. The writer's could have been "meaner" to our President by referencing his avoidance of Viet Nam service w/plantar faciaitis (I've had it twice & about all it does is bother you when you first wake up then you can run miles or play bball for hours - no problem), or his tax avoidance, or his dad bankrolling his retail land flipping, or his treatment of much much younger females. 
So the central plot theme was his emboldening the far active right to act upon their beliefs by mobilizing our innate fears thus determining the political future. It was not accident that "clowns" were chosen as the fear carriers. 
Another, related, politicized theme was female degradation, and whether they "can win an argument w/their husband"; "won't be catcalled"; "bosses won't talk about their tits"; "women can't lead"; "can be outsmarted & out muscled"; "should do is shut up"; "know their place & make a goddamn sandwich". I really loved coven. It had to be one of the best seasons of ahs that I've seen. It shows how these women are different and unique but powerful. They really tell us a story of fashionable witches and their history since Salem. Next season would have to be asylum. Asylum was the only season that's scary. If your a horror fan you should watch ahs "asylum". All other seasons are interesting because of their drama, this season is good because of how you jump in horror from it's scary story. Asylum is more psychological and really makes you think. I would rank apocalypse as a number 3. I know this season hasn't finish yet but I love how it can crossover many seasons without confusing the audience. I would rank hotel, murder house and cult as the same. I tolerated these seasons. They weren't as good as coven or asylum but they had their pluses, for example Lady Gaga made season 5 complete because without her this season would be utter garbage. Finally I would rank both Roanoke and Freak show as the worst. They are both confusing and annoying but tolerable. Overall I really loved the series and I really recommend it because once you start watching it, I promise you'll obsess. 3 series were fantastic out if 7 not bad. Coven , and maybe murder house ,freak show top notch Actually evil i a pg13 way. Bar Kathy Bates best character. So evil and condemn her too right awful I really liked the first seasons. But, season 6! oO That was painful... why would you like to see people burning or being shredded this way ? You really got to be sick to write that kind of stuff! As I havent seen the other seasons, this is only a review of the 1st season. <br/><br/>I'm not sure what to make of this show. It does have great acting, great cinematography and a creepy soundtrack. <br/><br/>It's more bizarre and confusing than actually scary. This is because it's one long story that takes an entire season to tell. Much of the time its hard to tell whats going on. The sho has flashbacks to other times and sometimes its hard to tell if its in the present ot in the past. Nothing will make complete sense untill the very last episode has been watched.<br/><br/>Jessica Lange twice won a much deserved emmy for her amazing performances on this show. She is still as fantastic an actress as she once was one of the most beautiful women on the planet. She still has that glow about her, that just draws you to her. <br/><br/>But overall all the actors on this show does a great job. Especially Teissa Farmiga (Vera Farmigas younger sister) and Evan Peters are impressive given how young they are. It was that and a curiousity to find out what the hell was going on that made me watch the whole season.<br/><br/>The final episode irritates me off, because of a hispanic family moving into the house. They were gross and acted like reality stars and seemed completely miscast for this show. Especially the nasty looking douchebag: Anthony Ruivivar, that we had to see shirtless time after time. He looks like a member of Chippendales and couldnt act worth a damn, if his very life depended on it 
As far as genuine horror goes, Ive seen it better in movies and on other shows like Supernatural and The X-Files.<br/><br/>From what I can tell most of the actors appear in several seasons, where they play new characters in new stories on each season. If that works then I will be impressed. For now I can only give this show 3 stars, based on the first season. <br/><br/>It's defintely worth a watch. In my humble opinion, the seasons take a delicate twist every time. Each character is perfectly portrayed by the fantastic cast. Gripping, perfectly put together and hopefully, never ending. I like the 5 first season but the season 6 is really cheap and like wrong way movies seems direct by some amateur teenager director . It takes some dedication to make it to the end, but the brilliance of this show is the same actors in this show playing different characters each season and then the occasional bringing back of characters throughout, some series were better than others admittedly, but whatever your fear, it will be covered! I've enjoyed the series a good deal, but it's a little overly bloody and violent just for the shock value. Every season is a different plot even though it uses a lot of the same actors but you learn to just enjoy the characters and the story for what it is. I am however turned off by the homosexual situations/characters in every season. I am a supporter of all kinds of orientations but in using homosexual peoples for entertainment/shock value i feel that the writers/producers are setting back their cause by a hundred years. ,,Hotel,, is the best,I give 8 stars for old glory,6 and 7 seasons are so disapont and boring and sick.I watches couse I am fan of that show and actors,espec.Evan Peters...and Jessica Lang before. and ok,i dont hate gays,but they are so boring with that,and like is soooo cool and good to be gay,..
,,Cult and Ranaoke,, are the worst...
Acting are very good,from all of them After Hotel: The fifth Season of FX's horror series had some interesting shock factor scenes but overall it suffered a similar fate as the previous four. The plot became so convoluted and the horror so repetitive that the last few episodes didn't hold my interest as the first few did. The new setup of a hotel had potential for a lot of frightening scenarios. Many of the characters introduced would later have great character arcs that I found more enjoyable than some of the previous series' characters. I especially like how they began to tie everything together with the other seasons, and it makes me want to go back and check them out. An intriguing plot line that I find did not follow through was the Ten Commandment Killer and the investigation by Detective John Lowe played by a brooding Wes Bentley. The mystery started off exciting but the payoff was lackluster. Chloe Sevigny played Lowe's wife with a passion that she has brought to all of her characters. <br/><br/>After Roanoke: The meta sixth season of American Horror Story took a new twist on reality television but used this twist to confuse audiences for the first half of the season and then totally change the course of the show for the second half. The first played out as a horrific reenactment of a couple's stay in a haunted house in Roanoke, North Carolina. The story was recapped by the actual residents of the haunted house who had survived the ordeal while actors played out the horrors, though this was not clear at first.<br/><br/>Shelby Miller (Lily Rabe) relates her traumatizing story when her and her husband Matt Miller (André Holland). To play out this horrifying drama is Audrey Tindall (Sarah Paulson) and Dominic Banks (Cuba Gooding Jr.). It gets a bit confusing as the show spins around and some characters are actually actors while others are actually people. After several cliché horror disturbances that are exacerbated by inexplicable and somewhat moronic decisions that put them in harm's way, Matt invites his sister Lee (Adina Porter) who is portrayed by Monet Tumusiime (Angela Bassett) who suffers from alcoholism and substance abuse while trying to maintain custody of her child.<br/><br/>After Cult: One of the first shows to take on the disturbing state of our country, Ryan Murphy delivers another horrifying season of this anthology series. On the day of the election of Donald Trump, there are two very different reactions. Ally Mayfair-Richards (Sarah Paulson) is terrified by the prospect of a complete buffoon taking over the presidency while Kai Anderson (Evan Peters) is wild with excitement over the prospect of a new age in politics. Ally has a ton of phobias that creep back up with a vengeance as she confesses to her therapist Dr. Rudy Vincent (Cheyenne Jackson). Her reaction to the election also causes a rift between her and her wife Ivy (Alison Pill). They co-own a restaurant together and raise their son Oz (Cooper Dodson), but things have become more difficult with Ally's frequent freakouts so they hire a nanny Winter Anderson (Billie Lourd). She is Kai's sister and has a strange way of taking care of Oz.<br/><br/>A lot of strange happenings occur around their Michigan neighbor and when their neighbors are murdered, a new couple moves in. Harrison (Billy Eichner) and Meadow Wilton (Leslie Grossman) raise bees in their backyard and act strangely when they meet their neighbors. Kai grows his influence as he runs for city council, inspired by Trump. Anyone who gets in his way ends up mysteriously dead. Beverly Hope (Adina Porter) reports news stories that raise the fear in the town and with support from Kai, rises up in the ranks at the station. Detective Jack Samuels (Colton Haynes) investigates the threats to Ally and the nearby murders but he is secretly part of Kai's cult and forms a relationship with Harrison. A young report Serena Belinda (Emma Roberts) challenges Beverly until she is brutally murder on camera.<br/><br/>Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com Back in 2011, television was in a time of medium-evolution where fantasy was starting to get explored via Game of Thrones, crime was already strong and proved terrain thanks to then current-mainstays like Breaking Bad and Boardwalk Empire; so where was horror besides The Walking Dead, and did it have to be all about the zombies? American Horror Story showed that you can sustain and creep people out for a whole seasons-worth of storytelling, and this show is a fun and terrifying romp that has covered haunted houses, asylums, witches, freak shows, hotels, farm houses and even modern political populism in the aftermath of Donald Trump. <br/><br/>American Horror Story covers truly interesting things, explores and exploits in every way you'd hope for. It may upset some for being non-PC in areas but since when is horror meant to play it safe? Horror is meant to be confronting and 'scary' so the audience can take something away that they didn't think about before.<br/><br/>FX is one of the finer cable networks still leaving its mark on millennials and expanding the television golden age in varying ways. I have only recently started watching it & absolutely love it. I didn't realise Jessica Lange left after season 4 (freakshow), She needs to come back! Not quite sure about the (hotel) season just yet has i'm only on ep.2 I will soon see but at the minute finding it hard to get into it i started on freak show is OK but not great then murder house which is brilliant its about this house and it shows all of the terrible things that have happened and the people that died cant exit the house you have to see murder house asylum is not bad very disturbing i find it very interesting and fun to watch always want to know what happens next. If you love horror and if you are bored with bad cheesy horror films, then you came to the right place. Watch this and you'll see what I am talking about. From the great performances coming from Jessica Lange, Evan Peters and Sarah Paulson, to great horror anthology plots like Coven, Hotel, Murder House and the rest, American Horror Story is an anthology series filled with psycho-horror plot seasons coming from the genius minds of Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk , great acting performances and enjoyable TV episodes.<br/><br/>10/10 BEST!!!!! I was looking for a new TV show to watch a couple of weeks ago and I accidentally discovered AHS.I am a huge fan of horror movies,so I decided to give it a try.I finished the whole series in two weeks and I can undoubtedly say that it is one of THE BEST TV series I have ever seen in my life.It is just unbelievably brilliant!It is great how every season has its own unique characteristics and the cast performance is superb.I am looking forward to upcoming seasons and in the meantime anyone who hasn't seen it,well then,what the heck are you waiting for?! WOW! This show is mind blowing. I have never seen a show like this before. It is gory, sexy and a little funny. Though season 4 and 5 are Rated R, they aren't that bad. Season 5 is the most sexual by far but i recommend it for 15+. Mostly because every teen these days knows about everything sexual and violent. This is nothing compared to what happens in the real world.It can have sex scenes but most are very short and not much is shown. The violence is quite dramatic and can leave you shocked at what just happened but nothing to keep you up at night about. Lady GaGa was a great addition in season 5 and 6. Season 5 (Hotel) centers around vampires and ghosts so it will be a little violent, in the end it is not that bad considering what teens watch behind parents backs. If you say no to letting them watch this then they will just watch it online. This is an amazing show, each season is COMPLETELY different which is so fun to watch. I suggest talking to your child about gore and sex before watching this jut to let them know it is not real and 90% of things are fake. I hope this helped you! Well I did not become a fan of the show until I heard Lady Gaga was going to be a cast member. I really liked "Hotel". So I signed up for Hulu so I could watch the other seasons. OHGOSH!!! I watched season 1 in two days. Once I started watching, I could not stop. I stayed up late one night and watched 7 episodes. That has me really hooked now. Evan Peters is so creepy. I was on the edge of my chair. So Many surprises I didn't expect. I have one question. If a person was killed in the house, they could not leave. But why was Tate able to go to the beach with Violet? He was killed in the house. And what happened that made Constance lose the house? --Spoiler Alert (I think)--Okay so season 6 didn't exactly start out they way I thought would, when Ryan Murphy said this season would be more darker then the others I thought YES my sadistic side has been waiting for them to one up them selves so I can feed my inner demons but sadly I haven't seen any evidence of that in season 6 so far (I'm trying not to judge to prematurely)...look only two episodes have come out so far but I dunno I just feel like either Ryan Murphy's going to flip the switch and create this AMAZING, grotesque nightmare or this is gonna be the season that brings the franchise down.....and this next part is mostly for me but why are they making Angela Basset play such a weak role look I know shes a recovering alcoholic (in this season so she has to be weaker) but if you look at her in the last two seasons shes played this amazingly strong women. _LJ American Horror Story is the best anthology series, since tales from the crypt, aimed to be gritty, realistic and apologetically brutally violent as they present each tale with a family who happens to be ghosts, serial killers\Nazis torturing patients, a coven of witches conjuring up monsters for the neighborhood and a murdering side show. Each take has a connection to one another of not evident at first like a brand of Coffee being named after a place or a character showing up in a new story set as a prequel to explain how they ended up in perilous predicament witnessed before hand. It keeps you on your toes to look out for clues or character actions and h exams sort of a game for fans.<br/><br/>Consisting on a great talent pool such Evan Peters, Jessica Lange and Kathy Bates who play a variety of interesting roles ranging from freaks to nurses and ghosts. Peters always playing the leading man always plays it with depth & conviction, Lange as the classy madam with a cutting edge tongue ready to pounce at any moment and Bates modest and pure that you can't help feel sorry for no matter what date she earns and befall her. The grand reviews keep rolling in, if you haven't been scared in a while, presented in fun fashion this is for you. American horror story is absolutely amazing. i have never seen anything like it and i don't think i ever will. the creators took a lot of risks when making this show and they all payed off. <br/><br/>It is a great show with every season being different and even stranger than the last you will never get sick of it, each season is not related to the last they are all separate with a different story and different characters. even though there is different characters the people at AHS still use most of the same actors with some actors even being in all 6 seasons playing a different character every time. which is great because you do get attached to the actors.<br/><br/>AHS has a lot of gore and blood with most main characters being murderers or killers, it is definitely not for the faint hearted. 9/10 worth watching. This show is one of the best shows I have watched in years. There is a good balance between horror, plot, and character development. Also the new plot for every season is very interesting. Every season will keep you guessing til the end. The creators have a very cool way of connecting every season with little events. Although some events may seem unimportant every detail counts with this show. The murders in this show aren't always just for the violence, sometimes they have a purpose; like to move the story along, explain a character and their actions or even to tie up a loose end that was left by previous events in the plot. So really, this show is just something amazing to watch if you love murder, horror or anything else gruesome and dark. I can really only comment on the first two as that's all I have "binge" watched yet. The first AHS I watched because I am a fanatic about haunted house stories and this one did not fail me. I was totally shocked when I found out some of the people who had been in the main characters lives or in fact ghosts and dead. That was a really cool Twist on a very old story line so well done. Right now I'm watching the second one and I was glad to see that they came back as a character so he's not taking anymore I guess who's the actor name is Evan somebody sorry terrible remembering actors names but anyway right now I'm getting through it but I mean I'm waiting to see if it's aliens or if it really is the devil or what's going on at this point I think the performances are outstanding though I think Jessica Lange is I don't know how to say it it's not that she's doing badly it's always that she's going so overboard at being such a terrible person as the nun that it's coming off as a bit hokey. And I would also say that the intro is actually more scary than the show itself. This show is really more like run- of-the-mill here's how crappy institutions used to be. I mean I know it's supposed to be in the sixties and things are supposed to be better and they were to an extent but if this or set in the late eighteen hundreds early nineteen hundreds then it could just basically be a documentary. But the character that's playing Walker.... You know the guy who is Tate in the last one whose name has escaped me in real life... He's exceptional in it and so is his friend the French chick and the nymphomaniac girls really good and so is the little sister that ends up being not so virtuous after being subjected to what I have yet to find out what whether it be the devil or some sort of alien thing anyway that is my two cents for now and once I've completed season 2 I will write a more complex narrative. I will probably be skipping the 3rd and 4th once because honestly I really don't give a crap about witches and I really hate stuff about freak shows but the last one about a hotel with a horror chamber now that sounds fun. Alright thanks for reading The last half a century television has givin us memorable anthology shows. Twilight zone, tales from the darkside, tales from the crypt, And finally American HORROR STORY. One thing that the show does like all the others before did was take risks but at the same time make it work for cable TV. It usually takes me till the 3rd or 4th episode of a season to get me hooked into its premise than before i know it im experiencing clever plot twists & even sometimes caring for a character i thought i never would. The past 5 seasons we've visited a murderous house, a crazy asylum, a witches coven, a 1950s freakshow, and finally a demonic hotel. And with the 6th season approaching i cant imagine what the mayhem in the series brings next. While there hasn't been a season yet where i consider amazing or even a season that i hate, ahs is well acted, well crafted, & well played as it is engaging. My favs from greatest to least at this point would be freakshow, coven, murderhouse, hotel, & asylum. Yes, call me behind the times, but I have just finished watching Series One ((Murder House), and have possibly picked up a clue, left by the Producers alluding to what the theme of Season 6 will revolve around. There is a comment made about Asylums, ....& Prisons! I maybe way off track, but my gut instincts are telling me the 6 the Season will be based within a Prison setting! I'd be interested to get anyone's thoughts on this. If the episode/actor/scene needs to be disclosed I will go back through final episodes to provide an accurate description of where to find it. What's the general consensus for S6 theme? BTW, I thoroughly enjoyed Murder House and am hoping that Asylum can deliver the same. i remember the very 1st Ep on season 1 and I thought oh my god what on earth is this I was confused and thought it was extremely weird. BUT that was it I was hooked even though it was weirdly strange I had to watch more .. its fab !! whoever the writer of this is has a crazy imagination to say the least . I cant even pin point which season I love the best but am looking forward to the next season, its a must to watch !! you will see some of the same actors and actresses in most of the different seasons. Last season was fab with Gaga in it she was amazing I'm hoping she will appear in the next one. you cant just watch one Ep and give up at least give it a few season and you will be hooked into the weirdness An anthology horror series, that uses a series of cast members, and then re-casts most of those actors in a different role, and time period. The exception (thus far) is s5, with Lady GaGa, replacing Jessica Lange.<br/><br/>S1 - -Murder House: Great start, to the series.<br/><br/>S2 - Asylum: Different setting, yet with a number of actors, returning (Jessica Lange, Evan Peters, Sarah Paulson, Frances Conroy), and a completely different setting. Very Grim!!!! <br/><br/>S3 - Coven: The setting shifts again, (and the best season, after Hotel), involving a coven of witches.<br/><br/>S4- Freak show: Dealing with a carnival of 'freaks' in 1952. Very funny, horrific, and sad!!!! <br/><br/>S5 - Hotel: Lady GaGa, assume the pivot, at the Hotel Cortez. She rules the roost. This has been the best season, thus far. Also if you really notice the seasons are starting to connect, big time. Great show, innovative, and hope its around for a long time!!!! This television series really turned on my entertainment receptors. Wow where to start. Before I begin, let me just say, SPOILER ALERT. Now that that's out of the way the first season of this series is set in older haunted mansion. The degree to which this house is horrifying is remarkable. The never ending killing (which turns them immortal) is so graphic and gruesome I sometimes feel like I'm going to get in trouble for watching it. The mansion theme only starts the story. In season two the viciousness of a mental institution is relinquished on the viewers and an entirely new character set (same actors) is cast. This continues leaving every season it's own thematic story-line. Three, four. and five are themed witchcraft, freak show, haunted hotel respectively. Never gets boring. Cannot wait for the next season. If your thinking about taking up a new show and you're into thrillers/horror this is for you. Try it even if you don't like scary shows, the plot is scintillating! 10/10. I only started watching this show 3 weeks ago... and I have watched all 5 seasons lol. I have never been so addicted to a TV show like this before. Absolutely gutted that I have to wait 8 months for season 6!! Loved all the story lines and how the cast were playing different characters. Asylum was my favorite, followed closely by murder house. <br/><br/>Enjoyed them all to be honest cant believe I didn't watch it ages ago. Gaga was brilliant but Jessica Lange was very missed by me in season 5. She makes the show for me ... :)<br/><br/>I love how she is a baddie but you cant help but like her. <br/><br/>Please make sure she is in season 6 !!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>I might watch them all over again ha ha At last, after a long time here is a really good season! The plot is a mix of some types of horror movies, but the combination is very interesting.The idea that in a hotel there are ghosts and vampires may be very common for someone. Although, all these are combined with real people and while the plot progresses, we discover a lot of strange relationships. This season is characterized by a lot of bloody scenes and generally illness!! "Sex,drugs and rock n roll" for those who do not understand. And now in the main spot: Lady Gaga! When i hear that Lady Gaga will be the main character of this season i was very curious to see her in a role like this. Although the role of "Countess" was ideal for her, i believe that she needs more practice with the acting. She did a lot of nude scenes-perhaps to compensate for the lack of talent- thing that i expected. In summary, it was an enjoyable season and now we are waiting for season 6. Finished the first two seasons and even though I'm not a fan of the horror genre, this series is almost impossible to stop watching. Straight from the first episode of the first season i was hooked and it just got better and better. The great thing about this series is that its more entertaining rather than a pure scare and gore-fest.<br/><br/>The first season got better with each episode as you are able to understand more about the plot and characters as the series goes on , towards the end it does get a little confusing however it does not distract the viewer from a brilliant and unique show. <br/><br/>The second season see's a little more gore but the unorthodox plots twists and various characters make this season even better than the last. This time the show primarily is set in a mental asylum for the criminal insane in 1964 which straight away intrigued me. My only criticism of this season is that the momentum of this show slows down in the last few episodes but this is needed to give closure to all the various on-going plots that this season saw. <br/><br/>Starting the third season soon and judging by the reviews this series will be even better than the last. Avid fan, cant miss an episode. Have to say I really loved the Murderhouse season best though. The tie in to aliens in season two I thought took away from the story. Season three, the witches was great. Love some New Orleans and Marie Lavuae was neat to bring to life. Freak show season four was well done, impressed with Sara Paulsons double headed acting. And Dandy was an amusing character.Great job! Now season 5. I am a huge lover of goth lore, so very excited we would be dealing with a vampire storyline this year. But I have to say, the most exciting part has been the soundtrack. Great job with adding appropriate music such as The Bauhaus, The Cure, the Hotel California was perfect, but the story line really wavers. I also think adding Eileen Warnos and other serial killers to an episode was distasteful being that many victims and people personally effected are still alive. Maybe they were watching...it seems to have had little to do with the storyline anyways. The acting is great though, Lady Gaga has done a convincing job. I just feel this season is all over the place. My husband watched all other seasons with my religiously, this time hes given up and falls asleep. So I watch it on my own. Love the setting,love the characters, love the music, but its missing something.......and no its not Jessica Langes crying every scene. Just needs more excitement, and not the cheap kind. Seeing a lot of nudity and guy/guy girl/girl action, just seems like looking for easy excitement.Its un appealing when its constant, build the erotic moments, not throwing them constantly. Anyways love the show, but Murderhouse.Asylum.Coven.Freakshow fit and worked. .not sure where this storyline that's all over ends up. ....and other then the Bates Motel does the idea of a vampire hotel fit American culture? More European to me. Regardless love AHS. I went into this series curious. Having not enjoyed the last few live-action shows I've watched, I was skeptical (I don't have anything against live-action). I haven't watched a lot of horror myself so I was curious about what a horror TV show could pull off. I was pretty surprised to find that I quite enjoyed it. <br/><br/>American Horror Story has a very interesting plot. Although it started out pretty weak and a little confusing to the point of not making sense, by the end of the first episode was actually genuinely curious about what was happening. I wanted to understand the world that had been created. Everything is presented really well too. The plot was engaging and left me on the edge of my seat on multiple occasions, and the concepts and events made to carry the series forward were amazingly well-done and thought out. Unfortunately I felt like there were some inconsistencies and some information didn't fit what I'd heard at another point, and oftentimes the audience was lead on by multiple lies at once so it made you wonder what information was correct and incorrect, which made it a whole lot more confusing than it needed to be. Maybe it was just my lack of attention, or maybe it was an actual continuity error. It didn't take away from the series too much, thankfully. <br/><br/>The characters felt shaky at best during the first half of the episode, but by the end of the episode they felt much more real and life- like. They had problems that had happened in their past, so they felt like they actually existed before the show started. Their problems don't start with American Horror Story, they continue and get worse. Not only that, but I actually liked a lot of them, and their problems were relatable, despite the fact that I've never gone through what they experienced (before and after the beginning of the show). <br/><br/>Overall American Horror Story is great. I was surprised to find that I really enjoyed it. With a great, well thought-out, well carried out plot and great characters, it's definitely one of the best in the horror genre I've seen. Although I don't plan on continuing it (for moral reasons), I'm happy to say that it was definitely a worthwhile watch and I really wish that I could continue it. In the end I would recommend American Horror Story, so long as your willing to be a wee bit creeped, scared, sad, disappointed, and happy. I like it overall. Great visuals (mostly), really good actors, sometimes really convincing performances. The only thing missing is a really good script. That is the weak point of the series. In the end is always a letdown, like the makers want to put everything in parenthesis, all the work done up to the season end is seam to be in vane, all the great expectations ruined. The 1st season end made the whole story a joke. The 2nd's end was the only one acceptable. The 3rd's and 4th's are basically the same: stupid happy ends after a myriad of bloodshed - no clues given away. Okay, I know the series is a spoof, so I could take it as a gag on the "hollywoodian happy ends", but it could be done a lot better. This way it just ruins an otherwise potentially great show. Having been new to this show about 5 months ago, and being English, I had never heard of this show and for obvious reasons had not watched it on television. However, after I came across it on Netflix I was extremely hooked! I think the story lines are well thought out, and the cast are absolutely brilliant despite them not being your obvious well known "big" stars.<br/><br/>Series one i thought was rather peculiar and a bit predictable, and by the end i thought some of the episodes were a bit pointless and silly by the end of it. Nevertheless, the acting was still good throughout, especially that of Taissa Farmiga, Evan Peters, Jessica Lange and Lily Rabe.<br/><br/>Whereas, I absolutely loved season two. Although it had much darker themes and it was much more scary and in some places violent, i thought the storyline of this one was well thought out with many twists and turns, with the whole "who was it" element to it. Also, it grips you from episode one and you feel like you really get to know all the characters. Sarah Paulson was absolutely exceptional as Lana, a journalist who was admitted to the asylum, and i thought Zachary Quinto made an extremely, chilling scary doctor with many hidden secrets! I have only just started season 3 and so far it is good, with some new faces like Kathy Bates and Emma Roberts. Overall, it is a great, really good, scary horror show that you should watch. However, many parts of it were hard to watch and quite disturbing afterwards. I hope the rest of season 3 and season 4 will be as good. ! It's a weird series from Ryan Murphy. The first season centers on a family in the present. Vivien (Connie Britton) and Ben Harmon (Dylan McDermott) and their daughter Violet (Taissa Farmiga) buy an old house in L.A. Vivien had a miscarriage and Ben had an affair. Ben is a psychiatrist using the house as his office. He has a patient named Tate (Evan Peters). There are ghosts and creepy neighbor Constance (Jessica Lange) and her daughter Adelaide. Vivien hires housekeeper Moira (Frances Conroy/Alexandra Breckenridge). The second season centers on the insane asylum Briarcliff Manor. The third season is about witches in 1834 New Orleans. The forth season is about a troupe of freaks in 1951 Jupiter, Florida.<br/><br/>I absolutely love the first season. It is one of the most creepy intense TV horror series. It's weird and creepy. McDermott's intensity really fits the tone of the show. Each successively year is a great idea that a story is build around. After year one, there are great individual scenes. I don't find those plots to be quite as compelling. That's my main complaint. I love the freaks in season four but there is a lack of a compelling narrative. After the introduction of new characters every year, I don't find myself pulled in by the new story. I usually abandon the show after a few episodes in the seasons after the first.<br/><br/>Season six is called "My Roanoke Nightmare", "inspired by true events" recounted by 'real people'. L.A. couple, Shelby (Sarah Paulson/Lily Rabe) and Matt Miller (Cuba Gooding Jr./André Holland), move back to his North Carolina roots after he gets attacked in a random street crime. They outbid the local rednecks to buy an old isolated house. Strange things happen and Matt asks his sister Lee (Angela Bassett/Adina Porter) to stay with them. Lee is a former cop and a recovering addict. This is a return to a good old fashion horror story. It's not jazzed up by an overarching style and concept. That's not to say that it returns to the absolute obsessive horror joy of the first season. The recounting simply makes it impossible to kill the characters who have 'real' person counterparts and the story is relatively derivative. It's definitely nowhere near as good as the first season unless Ryan Murphy can surprise me with something new and interesting. After finishing the season, Ryan definitedly tries to do something new. He simply tried too much. It's fine for a few episode but it becomes a mess in terms of story. This review is posted after having watched all 3 seasons.<br/><br/>Seasons in order of my highest liking: Season 2 wins over seasons 1 and 3 which are both equal in second place.<br/><br/>In my country we have a saying that refers to women as a power/force of nature both benevolent and malignant (mostly) depending on the case: Fire, Woman and Sea.<br/><br/>Woman-womanhood is the center center character of all 3 seasons. In season 1 in her role in the family/household and its satellites which takes place in a haunted house, in season 2 as a figure of authority and a figure/object of exploit which takes place in an insane asylum and in season 3 woman takes the role of what is and can go wrong or right in the world which takes place in a witch academy. Where does the male stand in all of this one would ask... Well, it's hard to say. After all, men have created this TV series.....<br/><br/>To speak about the 3 story lines one would have to admit that all clichés of the genre have been put to use. Yes, ghosts, religion, science, madness, Nazis, racism, aliens, zombies, the Frankestein monster, witchcraft and everything from the "holy bible" of horror stories. But all of them very skilfully and not boring at all. Horror is not just blood gashing or intestines slayed out of the body. Horror is the mind, the soul and the heart of all of us even when there is not even a drop of blood to be seen.<br/><br/>Jessica Lange is the High Queen of all the seasons so far. Her performance is no less than excellent, especially in the second season in which she reaches the very top. All of the cast is also very very good in their roles. Directing, photography, music, and the atmosphere in general serves the series very good. There are of course a few moments when things could have been better, as far as the writing is concerned, but overall American Horror Story is TV at its best.<br/><br/>Women should watch this show having in mind their immeasurable power and that putting in bad use can only do themselves the biggest harm and men should watch it having in mind that the term "weaker sex" is only a figment of their imagination. What both sexes do with those conclusions is up to the individual. Very good casting of characters, Jessica Lange's performance was one of her best, playing different sides of her character. Very good plot formation, editing, cinematography, Storyline. Episodes were Addictive, watching episode after episode. Season One and Two were my favorites. Season Two story develops, characters evolve and show more sides to themselves. Interesting, creative concept in storyline. Show captivates and pulls you in to each character's life. Having seen many horror films, this show I would classify as more of a supernatural, psychological drama in the horror category. Loved this show and would recommend it to anyone interested in being absorbed fully into the story.
